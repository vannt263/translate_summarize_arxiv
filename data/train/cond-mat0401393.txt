    "fluids adsorbed at micropatterned and sculpted solid surfaces may exhibit novel phase transitions and fluctuation effects compared to wetting behaviour at planar , heterogeneous walls @xcite . a striking example of the influence of substrate geometry on fluid adsorption is provided by a simple wedge geometry @xcite . at two phase coexistence ,",
    "a wedge - vapour interface is completely filled with liquid provided the contact angle @xmath4 is less than the wedge tilt angle @xmath5 .",
    "the phase transition from microscopic to macroscopic adsorption as @xmath9 is referred to as filling and may be first - order or continuous . the conditions for continuous wedge ( and also conic )",
    "filling are less restrictive than for continuous ( critical ) wetting at planar walls @xcite and give some hope that large - scale fluctuation effects associated with interfacial unbinding may be observable in the laboratory .",
    "recent effective interfacial hamiltonian studies have shown that fluctuation effects at continuous filling transitions exhibit a number of intriguing features . for three - dimensional wedge filling transitions critical singularities",
    "are believed to be far stronger than those characteristic of critical wetting transitions reflecting the anisotropy of soft - mode interfacial fluctuations induced by the wedge geometry .",
    "in particular for pure systems with sufficiently short - ranged forces the mean interfacial height @xmath10 ( measured above the wedge bottom ) and roughness @xmath11 are comparable and diverge with the same universal critical exponent @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these predictions are in very good agreement with monte carlo simulation studies of filling within more microscopic ising and lattice polymer models @xcite . for two - dimensional wedge filling on the other hand fluctuation effects",
    "are interesting for a different reason .",
    "studies of fluctuation - dominated filling in both ordered ( pure ) @xcite and disordered ( random - bond ) @xcite systems show that some observables , such as the mid - point height probability distribution function , show scaling properties which are _ identical _ with short - ranged critical wetting transitions",
    ". the only influence of the wedge geometry is to shift the effective value of the contact angle from @xmath4 to @xmath13 - a feature which has been referred to as _ wedge covariance _ @xcite .",
    "this  hidden symmetry \" between wetting and filling appears to restrict the allowed values of the critical exponents at both 2d filling _ and _ wetting and leads to new some insights into the properties of critical wetting transitions .",
    "the present paper focuses on the structural and fluctuation properties of 3d wedge filling transitions .",
    "we begin with a discussion of wedge covariance and illustrate using a simple interfacial model of filling in shallow wedges that the fluctuation - induced covariance observed for 2d systems has a mean - field or classical precursor for wetting and filling in systems with short - ranged forces .",
    "thus if @xmath14 denotes the mean - field result for the contact angle dependence of the critical wetting layer thickness , then in the wedge geometry the corresponding mean - field result for the mid - point height at bulk coexistence is @xmath15 the predictions of the interfacial model are supported by a detailed numerical study of filling in a landau - like density functional model that indicate this classical covariance is obeyed for both shallow and more acute wedges .",
    "the implications of classical wedge covariance for the structure of interfacial models of short - ranged filling and wetting are discussed . in the second part of our paper",
    "we turn our attention to fluctuation effects at 3d wedge filling and present a general scaling argument that relates the values of the critical exponents for 3d wedge filling to the wandering exponent of planar , two - dimensional and three - dimensional fluid interfaces .",
    "thus , for example the critical exponent @xmath16 is identified as @xmath17 where @xmath0 is the standard wandering exponent for a planar - like interface in a @xmath18-dimensional bulk system .",
    "our expressions recover the values quoted above for pure systems , corresponding to thermal fluctuations , and also allow us to discuss 3d filling in disordered systems .",
    "we also discuss the cross - over from three - dimensional to two - dimensional wedge filling as one lowers the number of dimensions of translational invariance along the wedge .",
    "the change in the nature of fluctuation effects and critical singularities in this wedge compactification process highlights a remarkable numerical coincidence concerning the value of the wandering exponent for planar interfaces at the lower marginal dimension for wedge filling . in the final part of our study we focus on 3d filling in pure systems and address some problems that have been highlighted concerning the transfer - matrix analysis of a pseudo - one - dimensional effective hamiltonian model .",
    "we argue that problems associated with the choice of the appropriate measure in the functional integral can be avoided if , in addition to breather - mode excitations of the interface , we also allow for tilt and torsional degrees of freedom .",
    "this more accurate formulation of the theory allows us to determine the universal scaling function associated with the density profile in the wedge .",
    "the form of this function is shown to have the correct short - distance and large - distance behaviour dictated by scaling theory and macroscopics respectively .",
    "consider a 3d wedge formed from the intersection of two smooth , planar walls that meet at angles @xmath5 to the @xmath19 plane forming a wedge with opening angle @xmath20 .",
    "the parallel displacement vector in the @xmath19 plane is written @xmath21 with cartesians @xmath22 measuring distances across and along the wedge respectively .",
    "thus the height of the wall above the @xmath19 plane is described by a height function @xmath23 .",
    "we suppose that the wedge is in contact with a three - dimensional bulk vapour at sub - critical temperature @xmath24 and chemical potential @xmath25 tuned to bulk two - phase coexistence @xmath26 . provided",
    "the contact angle @xmath27 of the sessile drop ( defined for the planar wall - fluid interface ) is less than ninety degrees the wedge preferentially adsorbs a volume of liquid near its bottom .",
    "partial and complete filling refer to situations where the adsorption is microscopic and macroscopic respectively .",
    "the separatrix between partial and complete filling follows from simple thermodynamic arguments first discussed by concus and finn @xcite some thirty years ago ( see also pomeau @xcite and hauge @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the accessible volume of the fluid and @xmath29 , @xmath30 the area and length of the wedge respectively .",
    "the total grand potential @xmath31 contains the macroscopic contributions @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the surface tension of the wall - vapour interface and @xmath34 is the excess wedge free energy .",
    "now suppose we are at bulk coexistence and imagine that the wedge is filled to a height @xmath10 ( see ) .",
    "macroscopically the liquid - vapour interface must be flat and hence @xmath34 must contain a thermodynamic contribution @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the liquid - vapour tension and we have used young s equation .",
    "it follows that for @xmath37 the free energy can be lowered by completely filling the wedge . for @xmath38 on the other hand",
    "the equilibrum value of @xmath10 must be finite and arises from a balance between thermodynamics and internal energy ( intermolecular forces ) or entropic ( fluctuation ) contributions .",
    "thus by either increasing the tilt angle at constant @xmath24 or increasing the temperature at constant angle ( assuming the usual scenario where the contact angle decreases with temperature ) one can induce a transition from partial to complete filling at a temperature @xmath39 satisfying @xmath40 filling transitions may be either first- or second - order corresponding to the discontinuous or continuous divergence of the mean interfacial height @xmath10 respectively .",
    "importantly , the conditions for continuous filling are less restrictive than for continuous wetting transitions and wedges made from walls that exhibit first - order wetting ( at some higher temperature @xmath41 ) may still exhibit continuous filling @xcite . the most important diverging lengthscales which characterise the the transition are the mean mid - point height @xmath10 , the perpendicular correlation length @xmath11 at the mid - point defined from the root - mean - square variance , and the correlation length @xmath42 describing fluctuations along the wedge .",
    "correlations across the wedge are described by a lengthscale which is trivially related to the mean - height : @xmath43 . at bulk coexistence critical exponents for the divergence of these length scales are identified according to @xmath44 where the temperature - like scaling field @xmath45 .",
    "the phenomenology is very similar for the case of 2d wedge filling except there is no analogue of the correlation length @xmath42 .",
    "a suitable starting point for the evaluation of the critical exponents is an effective interfacial hamiltonian model based on a collective co - ordinate @xmath46 measuring the height of the unbinding interface above the @xmath19 plane . at least for shallow tilt angles",
    "@xmath47 , the appropriate effective hamiltonian is a natural generalization of the standard capillary - wave model used to study planar wetting and we write @xcite @xmath48 = \\int d{\\bf{x } } \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\left(\\nabla l \\right)^2 + w(l-\\alpha\\vert x \\vert ) \\right\\ } \\label{heff}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the stiffness coefficient of the unbinding interface which , for isotropic fluids , we can identify with the surface tension @xmath36 .",
    "the model is not truly microscopic and is only valid for lengthscales much larger than the bulk correlation length .",
    "the binding potential @xmath50 describes the influence of intermolecular forces and decays at large distances as @xmath51 .",
    "the hamaker constant @xmath52 is positive in the temperature region of interest whilst the value of exponent @xmath53 depends on the specific range of the forces with @xmath54 for non - retarded and retarded van der waals forces respectively .",
    "it is also possible to modify the model to include the effect of quenched disorder but for the moment we concentrate on pure systems with thermal fluctuations .",
    "minimisation of the capillary - wave - like model ( [ heff ] ) determines the following mean - field values of the critical exponents for 3d filling @xcite @xmath55 thus fluctuation effects are extremely anisotropic at wedge filling with @xmath56 and are dominated by pseudo - one - dimensional local translations in the height of the filled region along the wedge @xcite .",
    "we refer to these as  breather - mode \" excitations . from the values of the above critical exponents",
    "it is clear that mean - field theory is only valid for intermolecular potentials with @xmath57 for which @xmath58 . the filling fluctuation ( ffl ) regime corresponds to potentials with @xmath59 and to study this parry , rascn and wood introduced a pseudo - one - dimensional wedge hamiltonian which accounts only for the breather - mode excitations @xcite : @xmath60=\\int dy \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma l_0}{\\alpha } \\left(\\frac { dl_0}{dy }   \\right)^2+v(l_0 ) \\right\\ } \\label{hw}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the local height of the interface above the wedge bottom and @xmath62 .",
    "the model is considered valid only for small wave - vectors @xmath63 .",
    "however because the fluctuations at filling are strongly anisotropic the relevant scaling combination @xmath64 diverges in the scaling limit and the cut - off does not determine universal quantities .",
    "the most important feature of this effective model is the presence of a bending term resisting fluctuations along the wedge which is proportional to the local interfacial height . at bulk",
    "coexistence the wedge potential @xmath65 has the form @xmath66 and for @xmath38 has a minimum located at the mean - field value of @xmath10 .",
    "notice that the first term in the wedge binding potential is the small @xmath5 approximation to the thermodynamic term @xmath34 and is proportional to the linear , temperature - like scaling field @xmath67 .",
    "the transfer - matrix analysis of the one - dimensional model will be considered later . here",
    "we point out two related interpretations of the model which give the desired classification of the allowed critical singularities without need for explicit calculations .",
    "both arguments will play a role in our later discussions . to begin we observe that the bending energy term is invariant under a renormalization group rescaling @xmath68 with wedge wandering exponent @xmath69 . under this transformation the linear scaling field @xmath67 and wedge hamaker constant @xmath70 rescale to @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73",
    "thus as anticipated the intermolecular forces are relevant and irrelevant for @xmath57 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "the temperature - like scaling field is always relevant and from its rescaling and the value of @xmath74 we can identify the values of the exponents in the ffl regime as @xmath75 equivalently we may say that in the ffl the diverging lengths scale according to @xmath76 which shows the dramatic influence the wedge geometry has on the fluid interfacial properties near the filling phase boundary . closely related to",
    "this simple rescaling analysis is the construction of an effective potential .",
    "we may imagine that the equilibrium interfacial height @xmath10 follows from minimization of an effective wedge potential which takes into account the contribution arising from the bending free energy .",
    "noting the scaling relation between @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath42 together with the first term in the wedge hamiltonian it is natural to suppose that the effective potential has the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 and the constant @xmath79 .",
    "thus for the present case of thermal disorder @xmath80 and the critical behaviour falls into two regimes for @xmath57 and @xmath59 depending on whether intermolecular forces or the bending energy is the leading order correction to the thermodynamic term .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise these ideas to a @xmath18-dimensional wedge which has translational invariance in @xmath81 dimensions along the wedge . as we shall see consideration of the  compactifaction \" from a three- to two - dimensional wedge",
    "highlights some interesting properties of the wandering exponent for planar interfaces .",
    "breather - mode excitations do not lead to large - scale interfacial roughness for @xmath82 and mean - field theory is valid . for @xmath83",
    "we find two possible fluctuation regimes corresponding to mean - field - like and fluctuation - dominated behaviour .",
    "the ffl occurs for sufficiently short - ranged potentials with @xmath84 with a generalised wedge wandering exponent @xmath85 valid for @xmath86 .",
    "the critical exponent for the divergence of the interfacial height in the ffl regime follows as @xmath87 and recovers the @xmath88 power law for the three - dimensional wedge .",
    "intriguingly the result ( [ betawd ] ) has the correct two - dimensional limit @xmath89 for filling with thermal fluctuations .",
    "we shall return to this later but first focus on the 2d limit in more detail .",
    "interfacial hamiltonian studies @xcite reveal that the fluctuation regimes for 2d filling are different to those for 2d critical wetting .",
    "nevertheless there appears to be a profound connection between the fluctuation - dominated regimes for each transition .",
    "recall that critical wetting refers to the continuous unbinding of the liquid - vapour interface ( say ) from a planar wall as the temperature is increased to the wetting temperature @xmath41 at bulk coexistence .",
    "the vanishing of the contact angle @xmath4 as @xmath90 is accompanied by the divergence of the mean interfacial thickness @xmath91 , roughness @xmath11 and transverse correlation length @xmath92 .",
    "more detailed information concerning the local height fluctuations is contained in the one - point interfacial height probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath93 where , in preparation for our discussion of wedge covariance , we have written the pdf in terms of the contact angle .",
    "wetting transitions are characterised by highly anisotropic fluctuations arising from the random - walk or capillary - wave - like motion of the interface which are quantified by the scaling relation @xmath94 with @xmath0 the wandering exponent for a free interface ( see later ) . at bulk coexistence",
    "the critical exponents for critical wetting describing the asymptotic divergence of these lengthscales are identified from @xmath95 generically , fluctuation effects at critical wetting fall into three regimes depending by the range of the intermolecular forces @xcite .",
    "these are mean - field ( mf ) , weak - fluctuation ( wfl ) and strong - fluctuation ( sfl ) scaling regimes .",
    "the sfl regime represents the universality class of critical wetting with sufficiently short - ranged forces @xmath96 and is characterised by large fluctuations @xmath97 and universal critical exponents . in two dimensions",
    "rather general random - walk - based arguments predict that the critical exponents in the sfl regime are explicitly related to the value of the wandering exponent .",
    "in particular for the interfacial height it is believed that @xcite @xmath98 which is certainly obeyed for pure ( @xmath99 ) and random - bond systems ( @xmath100 ) .    for 2d filling on the other hand interfacial hamiltonian studies",
    "show there are only two fluctuation classes corresponding to mean - field and fluctuation - dominated regimes for which @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively @xcite . in general",
    "the critical exponents describing mean - field filling and mean - field critical wetting transitions are unrelated .",
    "also the filling fluctuation ( ffl ) regime , representing the universality class of systems with short - ranged forces , is broader than the sfl regime for critical wetting and occurs for @xmath103 .",
    "simple scaling arguments indicate that within the ffl regime the interfacial height diverges with a critical exponent @xmath104 which is in agreement with model calculations in pure @xcite and impure @xcite systems .",
    "_ wedge covariance _",
    "@xcite refers to the  empirical \" observation emerging from effective interfacial hamiltonian and ising model studies that the equality of the critical exponents also extends to the full scaling properties of the respective one - point pdf s . in brief ,",
    "wedge covariance states that for systems with short - ranged forces , at bulk coexistence and in the scaling limit , the interfacial height pdf at the wedge mid - point @xmath105 is identical to the analogous pdf for strong - fluctuation regime critical wetting at a planar wall - fluid interface but with an effective shifted contact angle @xmath106 with @xmath5 the wedge tilt angle .",
    "thus if @xmath93 denotes the critical wetting interfacial height pdf written in terms of the contact angle , wedge covariance implies @xmath107 which is valid in the critical regime @xmath108 . from this",
    "it follows that the equilibrium mid - point height near a fluctuation - dominated filling transition satisfies @xmath109 where , in an obvious notation , @xmath14 denotes the sfl regime critical wetting film thickness expressed in terms of the contact angle .",
    "interestingly , the covariance ( [ cov1 ] ) necessarily leads to the exponent identifications ( [ sfl],[ffl2d ] ) whilst a third relation between the ffl wedge free energy and sfl point tension @xmath110 leads to the new result for wetting @xcite @xmath111 this expression leads directly to the identification of the critical singularity associated with the point tension consistent with exact ising model calculations @xcite and a more general conjecture due to indekeu and robledo @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that the above covariance relations , originally noted from interfacial hamiltonian studies of filling in shallow wedges ( in pure and impure systems ) , appear to be rather robust . for pure systems",
    "they are also obeyed by a drumhead interfacial model of filling in more acute wedges @xcite and , most importantly , are consistent with exact @xcite and numerical studies @xcite of filling in the square lattice ising model with tilt angle @xmath112 .",
    "the standard fluctuation theory of wetting at planar wall - fluid interfaces is based on analysis of effective interfacial hamiltonian models which describe the fluctuations of a collective co - ordinate @xmath46 measuring the local height of the interface from the wall .",
    "this coarse - grained description is valid at lengthscales much bigger than the bulk correlation length and , in its simplest form , is written @xmath113 = \\int d{\\bf{x } } \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\left(\\nabla l \\right)^2 + w(l ) \\right\\ } \\label{heffplanar}\\ ] ] where , as described earlier , @xmath49 is the stiffness coefficient of the unbinding interface and @xmath50 is the binding potential which , in general , accounts for the direct influence of intermolecular forces .",
    "we shall focus on isotropic fluid interfaces for which @xmath49 can be identified with the surface tension @xmath36 .",
    "for systems with short - ranged forces the binding potential describes not so much the range of the intermolecular potentials but the decay of perturbations in the local microscopic order parameter ( density , magnetization ) and is usually taken to have the form , at bulk coexistence , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the inverse bulk correlation length of the wetting phase .",
    "the temperature dependence of the coefficients @xmath116 is crucial at mean - field level .",
    "the leading order term vanishes at the mean - field wetting temperature so that @xmath117 whilst @xmath118 must be positive finite at @xmath41 to ensure stability and is usually taken to be constant .",
    "the structure of the binding potential can be inferred by comparison with more microscopic landau - like mean - field theories .",
    "more formally it can derived from a constrained fluctuation sum as in the approach of fisher and jin which also leads to the presence of a position - dependent stiffness - coefficient @xcite .    at mean - field level",
    "the equilibrium thickness @xmath91 of the interface follows from minimization of @xmath50 whilst the contact angle @xmath4 can be identified from @xmath119 .",
    "thus for systems with short - ranged forces the mean - field results are @xmath120 corresponding to critical exponents @xmath121 and @xmath122 . written in terms of the contact angle the equilibrium film thickness of the critical wetting layer is therefore @xmath123 which will be our intial point of reference for the wedge calculation .    for shallow wedges corresponding to tilt angles @xmath124",
    "the natural generalization of the planar model is the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) which simply assumes the interfacial interaction with the wall is controlled by the local relative height variable @xmath125 .",
    "note that the mean - field analysis is essentially independent of dimension since it assumes translational invariance along the wedge .",
    "the hamiltonian is minimised subject to the appropriate boundary condition @xmath126 as @xmath127 and yields the euler - lagrange equation @xmath128 it is convenient to write this in terms of the local relative height @xmath129 which , making analogy with classical mechanics , exploits the local galilean invariance of the euler - lagrange equation . on integration one",
    "obtains the  energy \" equation @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "thus at the wedge mid - point one finds the simple expression for the local height of the filling film @xmath132 as pointed out by rejmer @xcite this equation has a very elegant graphical interpretation which demonstrates that for quite arbitrary choices of binding potential the wedge undergoes a filling transition when @xmath133 , in precise accord with thermodynamic arguments .",
    "now consider the specific case of short - ranged forces with the binding potential ( [ binding1 ] ) .",
    "substitution determines the mid - point height as @xmath134 this not only identifies the logarithmic divergence of the film thickness at the filling transition , @xmath135 , but also reveals that the mean - field theory shows a  classical \" analogue of wedge covariance observed in the 2d calculations : @xmath136 in other words , for systems with short - ranged forces , the influence of the wedge geometry as manifest in the mid - point height is to shift the effective value of the contact angle .",
    "a similar property extends to the whole equilibrium profile which satisfies @xmath137 and smoothly interpolates from @xmath138 to @xmath14 as @xmath139 increases .",
    "profile covariance indicates that the height dependence of the meniscus contains information about the contact angle dependence of the planar wetting film @xmath14 and vice versa .",
    "classical wedge covariance is also manifest in the gaussian fluctuations about the mean - field solutions .",
    "this is most easily interpretated for the 2d wedge .",
    "consider for example the mean - field expression for the connected height - height correlation function @xmath140 and note that @xmath141 identifies the mid - point roughness .",

    "@xmath144 this can be compared with the result pertinent to critical wetting at the planar wall - fluid interface which can be obtained by simply setting @xmath145 , @xmath146 implying the classical wedge covariance relation @xmath147 for gaussian fluctuations about the mean - field solution .    for higher - dimensional wedges the actual mid - point roughness",
    "@xmath11 is no longer covariant because of the breather - mode excitations along the wedge . for such dimensions",
    "the quantity analogous to the roughness which shows covariance is simply the zeroth moment of the the height - height correlation function @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the relative separation of the two points along the wedge .",

    "we emphasise that classical covariance is _ not _ a general feature of the mean - field theory of filling and critical wetting . within a more general description based on a binding potential @xmath150 the filling and critical wetting exponents are distinct : @xmath151 this automatically rules out the possibility of ( classical ) wedge covariance for binding potentials of the form ( [ wlong ] ) .",
    "nevertheless the results presented above showing wedge covariance for short - ranged forces do generalise to the class of potentials @xmath152 where @xmath153 corresponds to an arbitrary choice of monotonically decaying function .",
    "choosing @xmath154 we obtain the usual short - ranged binding potential whilst setting @xmath155 one obtains a binding potential describing a particular type of multicritical wetting transition with @xmath156 . repeating the analysis above we obtain for the planar critical wetting and mid - point wedge filling interfacial heights",

    "we refer to the class of potentials ( [ omega ] ) as classical wedge covariant binding potentials .",
    "of course , only for the short - ranged case @xmath154 do we anticipate that such potentials have any physical significance .",
    "nevertheless they do point to an important feature of the present analysis .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that the wedge covariant potentials ( [ omega ] ) all describe planar critical wetting transitions with vanishing specific heat exponent @xmath122 .",
    "this mirrors precisely the situation for the fluctuation - induced non - classical covariance since for @xmath159 the value of the specific heat exponent in the sfl regime is @xmath122 .",
    "this covers both cases , @xmath160 and @xmath161 in 2d , where non - classical covariance is known to occur and it is tempting to speculate that the vanishing of the specific heat exponent either at mean - field level or beyond plays a key role for classical and non - classical covariance respectively .",
    "the prediction of classical wedge covariance shows that this hidden relation between filling and wetting for special types of forces is not necessarily a fluctuation - induced phenomenon .",
    "having said that we feel care should be taken in saying that the classical covariance is the underlying origin of non - classical covariance . whilst they are certainly related it is far from obvious why the covariant relation ( [ mfcov1 ] ) obeyed for binding potentials describing mean - field critical wetting with @xmath122 should remain unaltered in the presence of large - scale fluctuation effects which renormalise the value of the exponent @xmath162 whilst leaving @xmath163 unchanged",
    ". in view of this",
    "we treat classical covariance as a prediction which should be tested in more microscopic models of wetting and filling . since the binding potential ( [ binding1 ] ) is believed to describe wetting in systems with short - ranged forces we turn attention to numerical studies of filling based on a landau - like density functional model .",
    "this will also allow to test any limitations arising from the shallow wedge approximation implicit in the interfacial model .",

    "the number of points and the vertical scale were adjusted to produce the various wedge angles .",
    "a similar procedure was used to produce acute wedges , but here the horizontal distance @xmath186 was kept constant and the wedge made gradually deeper .",
    "this approach allowed us study filling in wedges with a fairly wide range of tilt angles , up to a maximum of about @xmath187 degrees , in a reasonable amount of cpu time .",
    "the effect of the variable discretization can be seen in .",
    "for the most open wedges , @xmath4 and @xmath5 agree to four significant figures as the fine discretization in the direction of the film growth , whilst for the very acute wedges @xmath4 and @xmath5 may differ by as much as @xmath188 degrees .",
    "the results of our study are presented in and . in",
    "we present data for the numerically determined phase boundary for tilt angles between @xmath189 and @xmath190 degrees which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction @xmath191 .",
    "we have also studied the meniscus profile defined as the surface of isomagnetization @xmath192 ( see ) . for wedges with tilt angles",
    "@xmath193 there is clear evidence for the logarithmic growth of the mid - point filling height @xmath194 with a universal , angle independent constant @xmath195 consistent with the shallow wedge limit @xmath196 .",
    "the constant @xmath70 is non - universal as is the size of the asymptotic critical regime which decreases with increasing wedge angle .",
    "nevertheless even for the most acute angles we consider there is no evidence that the amplitude @xmath29 differs from unity .",
    "more precisely for all wedge angles where there is clear logarithmic growth of the filling layer the amplitude of the logarithmic growth is consistent with @xmath196 .",
    "in other words , even away from the shallow wedge limit the film diverges as @xmath197 and behaves , in the critical regime , precisely like @xmath138 .",
    "this observation is certainly aesthetically appealing . in 2d , all results point to non - classical covariance for both shallow and more acute wedges as indicated by exact ising studies for the right - angle corner and also a drumhead model calculation with arbitrary wedge angle @xmath5 .",
    "the landau theory numerics , coupled with the interfacial model studies for the shallow wedge , show that this is also the case for classical covariance .",
    "given that the interfacial model ( [ heff ] ) is only valid for shallow wedges its is natural to inquire whether one can explain the landau theory results using a generalised interfacial model valid for more acute wedges .",
    "we finish this section by showing that a very reasonable , and for many purposes satisfactory , drumhead - like interfacial model proposed by rejmer , dietrich and napirkowski ( rdn ) @xcite does not fulfil this requirement .",
    "the model is a straightforward generalization of the shallow wedge hamiltonian but is amended in two ways .",
    "first the square gradient term multiplying the tension is replaced by the correct expression for the total area of the liquid - vapour interface .",
    "this is familiar from older drumhead - like capillary - wave models and ensures that the model recovers the correct filling phase boundary @xmath191 .",
    "secondly they propose replacing the relative vertical height from the wall to interface , appearing in the generalised binding potential contribution , by the normal distance to the closest wall ( see ) .",
    "thus the rdn model for the 2d/3d wedge is given by @xcite @xmath198+\\sec\\alpha w\\left(\\sec\\alpha\\left[l-\\psi({\\bf{x}}\\right]\\right)\\right\\ } \\label{hrdn}\\ ] ] where , as earlier , @xmath199 denotes the vertical height relative to the @xmath200 plane and @xmath201 .",
    "this assumption is certainly valid far from the wedge bottom where the interface and wall are parallel .",
    "one potentially unsatisfactory feature of it is that points on the wall for which for distances @xmath202 do not contribute to the binding potential i.e. the interface is blind to the wedge bottom .",
    "the mean - field equation for the mid - point height , obtained by minimising the hamiltonian and integrating once , is @xmath203 which is the analogue of the shallow wedge expression ( [ el ] ) . in this way",
    "it is straightforward to see that the wedge filling transition occurs at the correct thermodynamic phase boundary @xmath191 and that the critical exponents for continuous filling are independent of the wedge angle .",
    "now consider the case of short - ranged forces modelled by the binding potential ( [ binding1 ] ) . according to the above drumhead model the asymptotic divergence of the mid - point height",
    "is given by @xmath204 and contains a geometrical amplitude factor @xmath205 which is not consistent with the landau theory numerics . in other words the rdn model does not give the correct , wedge - covariant result ( [ acutecov ] ) .",
    "the failure of the rdn model to account for classical wedge covariance in more acute wedges is a surprising result .",
    "the model is certainly plausible and would appear to be the simplest possible generalization of the shallow wedge model .",
    "indeed when considered beyond mean - field theory using transfer matrix methods , the rdn model does predict non - classical wedge covariance for 2d systems with strictly short - ranged forces !",
    "we emphasise that there is no mystery here ; non - classical wedge covariance is a fluctuation - induced phenomenon for which the precise form of the binding potential ( determining the way in which short - range forces are modelled ) is irrelevant . in the presence of large fluctuations with @xmath102",
    "all points on the interface can feel the influence of the wall through collisions with it .",
    "thus in the 2d ffl regime it is sufficient to use a binding potential with a simple square well shape representing pure contact forces .",
    "this contrasts with classical wedge covariance which reflects the precise form of the underlying interfacial hamiltonian model . at mean - field level",
    "there are no fluctuation effects that take the interface to the wall and even for short - ranged forces the manner in which one models the large distance exponential tail of the binding potential is crucial .",
    "clearly the assumption that the wall - interface interaction occurs via the normal distance to points on the closest wall is incorrect .",
    "the absence of a @xmath205 prefactor in the landau numerics ( [ acutecov ] ) indicate that the correct measure of this is more akin to an effective local , vertical interaction similar to the shallow wedge model .",
    "this observation may well have ramifications for the construction of interfacial models of 3d wetting and filling in systems with short - ranged forces .",
    "in the treatment of fluctuation effects at 3d wedge filling presented in the introduction there appears to be little connection between the values of the critical exponents and the interfacial wandering exponent @xmath0 defined for a planar - like fluid interface .",
    "the value of the wandering exponent @xmath0 is crucial for discussions of depinning as well as complete and critical wetting transitions .",
    "interfacial fluctuation effects at such transitions are isotropic in the @xmath206 dimensions parallel to the interface and the wandering exponent describes the scaling relation between the roughness @xmath11 and transverse or parallel correlation length @xmath92 @xcite : @xmath207 in general the value of @xmath0 depends on the dimensionality of space and the qualitative type of disorder . for pure systems ,",
    "thermal fluctuations lead to interfacial roughness for @xmath208 and we have the well - known result @xcite @xmath209 where for the marginal case , the identification @xmath210 corresponds to @xmath211 .",
    "the lower critical dimension for phase separation is @xmath212 at which @xmath213 .",
    "the wandering exponent is altered in the presence of quenched impurities and it is usual to distinguish between random - field and random - bond disorder .",
    "random fields induce interfacial roughness for @xmath214 and general scaling arguments lead to the result @xmath215 @xcite implying a lower critical dimension at @xmath216 . for random bonds on the other hand the explicit dimension dependence of @xmath0 is not known . near the upper marginal dimension , @xmath217 , approximate functional renormalization group calculations of an interfacial model lead to the linear relation @xcite @xmath218 this is believed to be accurate even far from the marginal dimension since for @xmath1 it is close to the known exact result @xmath100 @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "numerical results suggest @xmath219 @xcite , slightly higher than the value predicted by the linear relation ( [ rg ] ) .",
    "the lower critical dimension for interfacial wandering induced by random - bond disorder is @xmath220 @xcite , below which they are unstable with respect to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the wandering exponent explicitly determines the fluctuation - dominated values of the critical exponents at the complete wetting transition .",
    "complete wetting is pertinent to planar wall - vapour interfaces ( say ) with vanishing contact angle and refers to the divergence of the mean wetting layer ( of liquid ) thickness @xmath221 , roughness @xmath11 and transverse correlation length @xmath92 as the bulk two - phase coexistence is approached . writing the bulk ordering field @xmath222",
    "we define critical exponents according to the power laws @xmath223 the general theory of complete wetting is rather fully developed and can be understood using effective interfacial hamiltonian models @xcite .",
    "the usual starting point for the discussion of fluctuation regimes is the continuum model ( [ heff ] ) with a binding potential @xmath224 where the hamaker constant @xmath52 is positive .",
    "transfer matrix and renormalization group studies show that the critical behaviour falls in two scaling regimes @xcite .",
    "the values of the critical exponents in these regimes can also be understood using a simple effective potential picture .",
    "as noted by lipowsky and fisher @xcite the form of the bending energy in the interfacial model suggests that fluctuation effects can be accounted for by minimising an effective potential @xmath225 where @xmath226 .",
    "the complete wetting transition is therefore fluctuation - dominated , belonging to the so - called weak - fluctuation ( wfl ) regime , for @xmath227 and leads to the critical exponent identification @xmath228 with @xmath229 .",
    "this approach together with the final exponent identification will be important in our discussion of filling in ordered and disordered systems .",
    "complete wetting and 3d filling share a number of common properties .",
    "both transitions exhibit two fluctuation regimes reflecting the fact that there is always a relevant thermodynamic contribution to the appropriate effective potential .",
    "the difference in the values of the fluctuation repulsion exponents @xmath230 and @xmath231 can be traced directly to the extra lengthscale dependence in the effective stiffness at filling . a relation between these exponents can therefore be found if we understand how an additional lengthscale in the stiffness alters the fluctuation - induced repulsion . to this end",
    "consider a complete wetting transition occurring in a finite - size three - dimensional geometry with short - ranged forces ( see ) .",
    "the system is of infinite extent in the @xmath232 direction ( say ) but of finite width @xmath30 much bigger than the bulk correlation length .",
    "we may suppose that periodic boundary conditions apply across the system .",
    "in the presence of a finite bulk field @xmath233 the mean interface height is finite but diverges as @xmath234 with the growth of the film thickness falling into two regimes .",
    "if the width @xmath30 is larger than the transverse correlation length @xmath235 of a three - dimensional complete wetting layer of infinite extent , then the film grows with 3d - like critical exponents .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath236 the growth of the wetting layer thickness must be characterised by critical exponents pertinent to 2d complete wetting .",
    "standard finite - size scaling ideas imply that the crossover between these regimes should emerge from the scaling hypothesis @xmath237 where @xmath238 is an appropriate scaling function . in the limit @xmath239",
    "the scaling function must approach a constant consistent with the bulk 3d limit . on the other hand",
    "as the argument vanishes we must impose @xmath240 in order to recover the correct 2d limit .",
    "thus the asymptotic divergence of @xmath221 as @xmath234 contains the finite - size dependence @xmath241 this asymptotic divergence should also be understandable using a suitably modified effective potential measuring the free energy per unit length of the finite - size system . as @xmath234 the interface behaves as a 2d - like complete wetting layer in an effective bulk field @xmath242 and with modified stiffness @xmath243 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath221 should therefore follow from the minimization of an effective 2d - like complete wetting potential @xmath244 where the exponent @xmath245 allows for the influence of the extra lengthscale dependence in the effective stiffness . in order to recover the correct finite - size result ( [ llasymp ] ) we must identify @xmath246    this exponent is key to understanding the connection between interfacial wandering and 3d filling since it accounts for the correction to the standard fluctuation induced repulsion at wetting when the effective stiffness in the @xmath247direction contains an additional length @xmath248 .",
    "this is also the case at filling where the effective stiffness along the wedge is proportional to the interfacial height @xmath10 .",
    "simple power counting implies that the fluctuation - induced repulsion exponent for the wedge is @xmath249 which reduces to @xmath250 in this way we can explicitly relate all the 3d wedge filling exponents in the ffl regime to the values of the interfacial wandering exponent for 2d and 3d planar interfaces . thus @xmath251 with wedge wandering exponent @xmath252 which is valid provided both the two- and three - dimensional interfaces are well - defined and rough .",
    "that is the dimensionality must be such that @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "similarly , and subject to the same provisos , the critical exponent for the interfacial height reduces to @xmath255 which is the central result of this section .",
    "the interpretation and implications of this result are discussed in detail below .      for pure systems the wandering exponent has values @xmath99 and",
    "@xmath210 in two and three dimensions respectively .",
    "consequently ( [ zetafinal ] ) and ( [ betafinal ] ) recover the effective hamiltonian predictions @xmath69 and @xmath7 discussed earlier . further support for the connection between filling critical exponents and interfacial",
    "wandering arises when we generalise the above discussion to the @xmath18-dimensional wedge with @xmath256 dimensions along the direction of translational invariance .",
    "the analysis is unchanged except that @xmath257 and @xmath258 are replaced by @xmath259 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "thus for a generalised wedge we predict @xmath260 provided that fluctuations are dominated by the @xmath256 dimensional breather modes along the wedge . substituting the thermal result @xmath261 recovers ( [ betawd ] ) for @xmath262 . for @xmath263 ( [ genbetawd ] )",

    "notice that , in the limit @xmath264 , ( [ genbetawd ] ) recovers the correct two - dimensional filling result @xmath89 even though the breather - mode excitations are effectively zero - dimensional , and that @xmath265 .    for impure systems we are able to make some new predictions for filling in random - bond and random - field systems . for random - bond systems we use the values @xmath100 and",
    "@xmath266 to predict that in the ffl regime @xmath267 which are valid for sufficiently short - ranged forces . assuming that there are only two fluctuation regimes and that there is a smooth cross - over from mean - field to fluctuation - dominated exponents we anticipate that the above predictions are valid provided the power law for the intermolecular forces @xmath268 .",
    "thus dispersion - like ( van der waals ) forces are irrelevant in the renormalization group sense and belong to the universality class of systems with short - ranged forces .",
    "note that the value of the fluctuation repulsion exponent @xmath230 is positive for both pure and random - bond systems .",
    "the case of 3d filling in systems with random - field disorder is less clear - cut . using the values @xmath269 and @xmath270 we are led to the predictions @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "however some caution is required in the assessing these predictions since the reliance on the marginal value @xmath269 is somewhat unsatisfactory .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the two - dimensional limit of ( [ genbetawd ] ) for filling with thermal disorder which the relies on the marginal value @xmath265 .",
    "the fact that the breather - mode picture generates the correct two - dimensional result for this case leads some support to the above predictions for 3d random - field filling .",
    "however the situation is worse for random - field disorder since the fluctuation repulsion exponent @xmath230 is _ negative _ for @xmath273 .",
    "it is likely therefore that the exponent identification ( [ betafinal ] ) is not appropriate for 3d wedge filling with random fields . here after we limit our discussion to thermal and random - bond disorder only .",
    "the above results for the values of the critical exponents for fluctuation - dominated three - dimensional wedge filling in pure and impure ( random - bond ) systems complement the known result for two - dimensional filling ( [ ffl2d ] ) . it is therefore interesting to ask how the three - dimensional result ( [ betafinal ] ) becomes the two - dimensional result as we compactify the wedge and reduce the number of dimensions along it . for pure systems with only thermal disorder",
    "the situation seems straightforward since the result ( [ genbetawd ] ) is valid for @xmath274 .",
    "as noted above the generalised breather - mode result smoothly recovers the correct numerical result @xmath89 in this limit .",
    "there is however something remarkable about this since equating the two expressions ( [ ffl2d ] ) and ( [ genbetawd ] ) implies @xmath275 yielding information about the allowed value of the wandering exponent .",
    "noting that the lower critical dimension for pure systems is @xmath212 and that at this dimension @xmath276 we may conclude that equality of the breather - mode and wedge - covariant results for the critical exponents necessitates that for thermal fluctuations @xmath277 which is correct . turning attention to random - bond systems",
    "however note that we are not permitted to extend the breather mode result down to @xmath1 since the expression ( [ genbetawd ] ) is not valid when @xmath278 equivalent to @xmath279 .",
    "therefore we are not able to equate distinct expressions for the filling critical exponents in two dimensions and are unable to discuss the values of these exponents for @xmath280 .",
    "however we are still free to discuss the properties of the filling critical exponents as @xmath281 from above .",
    "in particular , in view of the thermal result ( [ zeta=1/2 ] ) , it is natural to inquire what the value of the wandering exponent is for random - bond systems one dimension above the lower critical dimension .",
    "that is , what is the value of @xmath282 ? as discussed earlier a reliable estimate for the value of the wandering exponent is provided by the linear relation ( [ rg ] ) which is only slightly below the exact result in two dimensions . at @xmath283 this yields @xmath284 which we anticipate to be only slightly below the true result .",
    "this remarkable numerical coincidence leads us to conjecture that ( [ zeta=1/2 ] ) is also valid for random - bond systems so that @xmath285 it is natural to ask whether this conjecture has any support from other examples of fluctuating surfaces .",
    "lipowsky has considered interfacial wandering and unbinding within a generalised class of effective hamiltonians with bending energy term of the forms @xcite @xmath48=\\frac{k}{2}\\int d{\\bf{k } } k^{2-\\eta } \\vert \\tilde l(k)\\vert^2 + \\int d{\\bf{x } } w(l({\\bf{x } } ) ) \\label{lip}\\ ] ] written in terms of the fourier components of the collective co - ordinate .",
    "a remarkable property of such models is that for @xmath286 the fixed point behaviour ( pertinent to short - ranged critical unbinding @xcite ) is controlled by a single parameter rather than by @xmath287 and @xmath18 separately . for our purposes we note only that the wandering exponent @xmath288 and that the value at which this is unity allows us to identify @xmath289 .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath290 consistent with the known result for interfaces in pure systems and our conjecture for interfaces subject to random - bond disorder . on the other hand",
    "the result ( [ zeta=1/2 ] ) is not universally valid since for interfaces in random fields @xmath291 implying @xmath292 .",

    "it is also convenient to re - write the wedge potential as @xmath311 notice that when we set the field @xmath312 at all points along the wedge the btt hamiltonian reduces to the wedge model ( [ hwz ] ) . to assess the relevance of tilt and torsional modes on the critical behaviour of the model we consider a rescaling of the co - ordinates and fields similar to that discussed earlier . with the additional tilt field",
    "we now consider the properties of the model under the mapping @xmath313 where , as before , the wedge wandering exponent @xmath314 . under this",

    "this means that they do not affect the critical behaviour and that the btt model can be simplified to @xmath318=\\int dy \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma l_0}{\\alpha }   \\left(\\frac { dl_0}{dy } \\right)^2 + v(l_0,\\phi ) \\right\\ } \\label{hwphi}\\ ] ] the tilt field @xmath245 is therefore non - interacting but still coupled to the breather - mode excitations . as the interface unbinds from the wedge bottom the tilt fluctuations become increasingly massive and are suppressed",
    ". an important consequence of this is that when we integrate out the tilt field the particular choice of the parameter @xmath319 becomes unimportant in the scaling limit .",

    "is required in defining the new measure since we must impose the correct normalization conditions .",
    "this is most easily illustrated for 2d wedge filling in which there is no @xmath232-direction and the choice of measure @xmath320 relates only to one @xmath221 and one @xmath245 variable .",

    "the pdf has the short - distance expansion @xmath332 with @xmath333 .",
    "recall that for pure systems @xmath89 ( in 2d ) implying that the two - field pdf @xmath325 must contain a @xmath334 prefactor in - order to preserve thermodynamic consistency .",
    "this argument is supported by explicit results for the 2d wedge filling for contact binding potentials ( see [ appendix ] ) .",
    "a similar line of reasoning applies in higher dimensions . to determine the form of the 3d measure we first focus on the filling transition occurring in a cone geometry",
    "the reason for this is that the breather - mode excitations are essentially zero - dimensional and we only have one height variable @xmath335 measuring the height of the interface above the cone vertex .",
    "up to a normalization factor the probability of finding the interface at height @xmath305 with tilt @xmath245 is determined by the boltzmann weight @xmath336 where @xmath337 is the free - energy cost of the configuration .",

    "this macroscopic configuration has the shape shown in and the free - energy cost is dominated by a thermodynamic area - like contribution .",
    "this can be readily calculated making use of young s equation yielding @xmath367 .",
    "the short - distance expansion ( sde ) of the scaling function @xmath361 corresponding to the limit @xmath368 is also consistent with known critical exponent relations . for 2d and",
    "3d wedge filling the scaling function for the pdf has the short - distance behaviour @xmath369 where the sde critical exponent @xmath333 .",
    "this exponent relation follows from rather general sum - rule and scaling arguments .",
    "thus for 3d filling in pure systems with @xmath7 we anticipate @xmath370 for @xmath371 .",
    "this emerges naturally from solution to the schrdinger equation since in terms of the @xmath372 variable @xmath373 as @xmath374 and recall @xmath375 .",
    "the large - distance and sde properties of the pdf give strong support to the correctness of the one - dimensional wedge hamiltonian model .",
    "the numerically determined scaling form of the pdf found from solution to the schrdinger equation is shown in .",
    "in this paper we have addressed a number of issues pertaining to 3d wedge filling transitions .",
    "we began with a discussion of wedge covariance relations between filling and critical wetting and showed that the fluctuation - induced covariance observed for 2d filling has a mean - field analogue .",
    "similar to the 2d case classical covariance appears to be specific to systems for which the critical wetting specific heat exponent @xmath122 . numerical studies of mean - field filling within a landau theory show that classical covariance is not limited to the shallow wedge limit .",
    "importantly this provides a constraint on the possible form of effective hamiltonian models of wedge filling and implies that a model suggested by rejmer @xcite is not consistent with more microscopic approaches .",
    "it is likely that in order capture the correct classical covariance for wetting and filling it will be necessary to construct non - local interfacial models .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere .    in the second part of our paper",
    "we turned attention to fluctuation effects at 3d wedge filling .",
    "our central new result is that the critical exponents which characterise the fluctuation - dominated regime can be related to the values of the standard wandering exponent for _ planar _ interfaces in 2d and 3d ( bulk ) systems .",
    "the expressions for @xmath16 and the wedge wandering exponent @xmath74 expressed in terms of @xmath257 and @xmath258 are rather general and allow the discussion of filling in systems with random - bond disorder . a surprising feature emerging from our study",
    "concerns some intriguing numerical coincidences for the value of the bulk wandering exponent @xmath0 as one approaches the lower marginal dimension for wedge filling in pure and random - bond systems .",
    "in particular we are led to conjecture that for random - bond disorder @xmath376 .    in the final part of our paper we addressed some queries that have been highlighted concerning the pseudo - one - dimensional wedge hamiltonian theory of 3d filling in pure systems .",
    "bednorz and napirkowski @xcite have suggested that these can be avoided if one supposes that the fluctuating field is not the interfacial height @xmath293 above the wedge bottom but @xmath377 .",
    "we showed that this choice indeed emerges naturally if one considers the coupling between tilt and torsional fluctuations described by a second field @xmath378 and breather - mode excitations of @xmath293 .",
    "the form of the pdf for the interfacial height predicted by the wedge hamiltonian model is shown to have the correct short - distance and large - distance behaviour dictated by macroscopic arguments and critical exponent relations .",
    "we believe this strongly supports the internal consistency of the effective wedge hamiltonian model .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction the values of the critical exponents predicted by the wedge hamiltonian are in very good agreement with ising model simulation studies",
    ". a more stringent test of the theory would be to study the scaling of the interfacial height pdf .",
    "this can be readily extracted from ising model studies since it corresponds to the derivative of the magnetization profile measured along the vertical above the wedge bottom . to do this quantitatively",
    "it would be necessary to generalise the present theory to study the finite - size scaling of the pdf and magnetization profile in the same geometry studied by milchev @xcite .",
    "this will be a topic of future work .",
    "finally we mention that ideally one would hope to circumvent the entire wedge hamiltonian theory and replace it with a more microscopic approach .",
    "in particular it would be extremely useful if one could apply a renormalization group analysis to derive the wedge filling critical exponents from the full capillary - wave model ( [ heff ] ) . to do",
    "this one would have to identify a new fixed - point distinct from the gaussian ( or strong - fluctuation regime ) fixed - point used to study wetting transitions .",
    "such additional fixed points for the capillary - wave model may exist if one generalises the spatial rescaling to account for the anisotropy of correlation lengths across and along the wedge .",
    "one would hope , of course , that such an approach would lead to the same predictions for universal critical exponents and scaling functions found using the effective one - dimensional wedge hamiltonian . as well as being an independent check on the validity of the wedge hamiltonian model ( in the scaling limit )",
    "such an approach would also shed much light on the emergence of an effective one - dimensional theory from a higher dimensional model .",
    "the authors wish to thank dr a. j. wood for discussions concerning the nature of wedge filling in disordered systems , and i - d media ag , berlin , for the donation of a workstation .",
    "mjg and jmr - e gratefully acknowledge the epsrc and secretara de estado de educacin y universidades ( spain ) , co - financed by the european social fund for financial support respectively .",
    "in this appendix we provide further justification for the role played by tilt fluctuations at 2d wedge filling making contact with exact results obtained from interfacial hamiltonian studies . we restrict attention to systems with short - ranged forces corresponding to the ffl regime and set @xmath143 for convenience .",
    "consider the @xmath379point probability distribution function @xmath380 determining the probability for finding the interface at heights @xmath381 , @xmath305 and @xmath382 at positions @xmath383 , @xmath384 and @xmath166 , respectively .",

    "the interface will be affected by the presence of the substrate when @xmath395 .",
    "this expression defines the effective value of @xmath396 at which the interface is in contact with the substrate .",
    "we consider the angle formed by the horizontal and the line that joins the interface position at the midpoint and the position ( relative to the substrate ) at @xmath396 ( see ) .",
    "the tilt angles @xmath397 and @xmath398 are _ defined _ as the departures of the previously defined angles with respect to the average value @xmath4 .",
    "we stress that the interface is not considered stiff but is allowed to wander due to capillary - wave fluctuations .",
    "however , the length scale on which these fluctuations occur is much smaller than the one that characterizes the constrained profile .",
