    "interactions in the source itself or in the vicinity of the source of hadronic particles ( protons , nuclei ) yield neutral and charged pions , which subsequently decay into high - energy photons and neutrinos .",

    "particles with energies above the threshold of the gzk effect can travel less than about 100  mpc through the universe , before their energy has decreased to @xmath45 of their initial value . or , in other words , particles reaching the earth at these energies have propagated less than 100  mpc , see also @xcite , and their sources are inside a sphere with this radius      it has been discussed that for both scenarios , acceleration and top - down models , hadronic cosmic rays are accompanied by high - energy photons and neutrinos .",
    "also during the propagation of hadronic particles through the universe high - energy photons and neutrinos are produced . to clarify the origin of the highest - energy particles in the universe ,",
    "simultaneous observations are desired of high - energy charged particles , photons , and neutrinos  a multi - messenger approach .",
    "thus , the observation of high - energy charged particles , or charged particle astronomy , is complementary to observations in gamma ray astronomy @xcite and neutrino astronomy @xcite .",
    "attention has to be paid on the simultaneous observation : if a charged particle is deflected by an angle @xmath46 in a ( for this estimate simply homogeneous ) magnetic field , its path @xmath47 is somewhat longer as compared to the path of a massless neutral particle @xmath48 .",
    "their relative difference can be approximated as @xmath49 if a charged particle from a source at a distance @xmath50  mpc is deflected by @xmath51 , a value @xmath52 is obtained .",
    "this corresponds to a difference in the arrival time of a charged particle relative to a photon ( both traveling at the speed of light ) of about @xmath53  a. thus , for a simultaneous detection the acceleration processes have to be stable over such a period in time .",

    "the by far dominant particles in a shower are electromagnetic particles ( photons , electrons , and positrons ) .",
    "most of the energy of the primary particle is absorbed in the atmosphere .",
    "however , a small fraction of the energy is transported to ground level and may be registered in detectors for electrons , muons , and hadrons .",
    "particles traveling with relativistic speeds through the atmosphere ( mostly electrons and positrons ) emit light .",
    "the shower particles also excite nitrogen molecules in the air which in turn emit fluorescence light .",
    "while the light is collimated in the forward direction of the particle , the fluorescence light is emitted isotropically , thus , a shower can be `` viewed from aside '' .",
    "the objective of experiments observing extensive air showers is to determine the properties of the primary particle ( energy @xmath55 , mass @xmath56 , arrival direction ) . in the energy regime of interest ( @xmath57  ev )",
    "mainly two methods are applied .",

    "the shower - detector plane is determined from the observed track in the camera .",
    "the orientation of the shower axis in this plane is then obtained by measurements of the arrival time of the photons at the detector .",
    "using two ( or more ) telescopes to view the same shower allows a three - dimensional reconstruction of the shower axis .",
    "the shower * energy * is proportional to the number of electrons @xmath58 and muons @xmath59 in the shower . a simple numerical model @xcite yields the relations @xmath60 to estimate the primary energy .",
    "this illustrates that measuring @xmath58 or @xmath59 gives a good estimate for the energy almost independent of the particles mass .",

    ", the number of photons registered per square meter in a detector at a distance @xmath61 to the maximum of a shower with energy @xmath55 can be estimated as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fluorescence yield of electrons in air and @xmath64  2 ( or 304  m at normal pressure ) the radiation length .",
    "absorption and scattering in the atmosphere have been neglected in this simple estimate , thus , the equation gives an upper limit for the registered photons .",
    "experimentally most challenging is the estimation of the * mass * of the primary particle .",
    "showers induced by light and heavy particles develop differently in the atmosphere .",
    "the depth in the atmosphere at which the showers contain a maximum number of particles depends on the primary particles mass @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the depth of the shower maximum for proton - induced showers @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , at high altitudes ( with low air densities ) charged pions are more likely to decay , thus , yielding more muons .",
    "hence , the electron - to - muon ratio observed at ground level depends on the mass of the primary particle .",

    "air showers induced by primary photons develop an almost pure electromagnetic cascade .",
    "experimentally they are identified by their relatively low muon content or their relatively deep shower maximum . since",
    "mostly electromagnetic processes are involved in the shower development , the predictions are more reliable and do nt suffer from uncertainties in hadronic interaction models .",
    "a compilation of recent upper limits on the contribution of photons to the all - particle flux is shown in @xcite .",
    "the best photon limits are the latest results of the @xcite setting rather strong limits on the photon flux .",
    "they are based on measurements with the auger surface detectors , taking into account observables sensitive to the longitudinal shower development , the signal rise time , and the curvature of the shower front .",
    "the photon fraction is smaller than 2% , 5.1% , and 31% above energies of @xmath40 , @xmath101 , and @xmath93  ev , respectively with 95% confidence level .    in top - down scenarios for high - energy cosmic rays , the particles are decay products of super - heavy particles .",

    "the arrival directions of cosmic rays provide an important observable to investigate the sources of these particles .",
    "since charged particles are deflected in magnetic fields , the cosmic - ray flux observed at earth is highly isotropic . a significant evidence for an anisotropy in the arrival directions would be the most direct hint towards possible cosmic - ray sources .",
    "unfortunately , only limited experimental information is available about both , galactic @xcite and extragalactic @xcite magnetic fields .",
    "selecting particles at the highest energies limits the field of view to distances less than 100  mpc , see ( ) . this implies two advantages : the number of source candidates is limited and the particles are only slightly deflected since they propagate a restricted distance only .",

    "of particular interest to search for anisotropies in cosmic rays is the region around @xmath7  ev . at these energies",

    "this correlation and further ones as reported in @xcite between bl lacs and registered by the agasa and yakutsk experiments were not confirmed by data of the hires experiment @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an excess of correlations was found for a subset of bl lacs and cosmic rays with energies above 10  eev @xcite .    in spring 2007",
    "the number of events recorded by the above 10  eev was six times larger than the data used in previous searches .",
    "the correlation hypotheses reported previously have been tested with the auger data @xcite .",
    "since the southern detector of the sees a different part of the sky as compared to the agasa , hires , and yakutsk experiments , only the recipes could be tested but using different sources on the sky .",
    "non of the previously reported hypotheses could be confirmed , the chance probabilities for the different approaches were found to be slightly smaller than 1% .",

    "as can be inferred from the figure , the measured data are compatible with an isotropic distribution and they do not confirm earlier findings .",
    "another interesting set of objects to serve as sources of are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",

    "different scenarios related to agn have been developed , which are supposed to accelerate particles to highest energies , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the arrival directions of cosmic rays as measured by the have been correlated with the positions of agn @xcite .",
    "data taken during the construction of the observatory since january 2004 have been analyzed , corresponding to slightly more than one year of data of the completed observatory .",
    "the angular resolution of the detector is better than 1at energies above @xmath40  ev @xcite .",
    "the positions of agn according to the @xmath119 edition of the catalog of quasars and nuclei @xcite within a distance @xmath120 have been used .",
    "a scan has been performed over the distance @xmath120 , a threshold energy @xmath121 , and the correlation angle @xmath46 .",
    "the best correlation has been found for events with energies exceeding @xmath122  eev , a maximum distance @xmath123  mpc , corresponding to a redshift @xmath124 , and a correlation angle @xmath125 . with these parameters",
    "20 out of 27 cosmic rays correlate with at least one of the 442 selected agn ( 292 in the field of view of the observatory ) .",
    "only 5.6 are expected , assuming an isotropic flux .",
    "the 27 cosmic rays measured with the highest energies are shown in together with the positions of the agn .",
    "many of the observed correlated events are aligned with the super - galactic plane .",
    "two events have arrival directions less than 3away from centaurus  a. these results indicate clearly that the arrival directions of cosmic rays at highest energies are not isotropic .    a cosmic ray with charge @xmath126 that travels a distance @xmath120 in a regular magnetic field @xmath127 is deflected by an angle @xcite @xmath128 assuming a coherence scale of order @xmath129  kpc @xcite for the regular component of the galactic magnetic field , the deflection angle is a few degrees only for protons with energies larger than 60  eev .",
    "this illustrates that the observed angular correlations are reasonable , but one has to keep in mind the limited knowledge about galactic magnetic fields .",
    "the angular scale of the observed correlations also implies that intergalactic magnetic fields along the line of sight to the sources do not deflect cosmic - ray trajectories by much more than a few degrees .",
    "the root mean square deflection of cosmic rays with charge @xmath126 , traveling a distance @xmath120 in a turbulent magnetic field with coherence length @xmath130 is @xcite @xmath131 as information on intergalactic magnetic fields is very sparse , the correlations observed can be used to constrain models of turbulent intergalactic magnetic fields . within the observed volume",
    "they should be such that in most directions @xmath132 . in the future",
    "the will collect more data and more than one event per source should be detected .",
    "it should then be possible to use the data itself to set constraints on magnetic field models .",
    "it should be noted that the findings by the imply that the sources of the highest - energy - cosmic rays are spatially distributed like agn . the actual acceleration sites could be the agn itself or other candidates with the same spatial distribution as agn .",
    "`` how do cosmic accelerators work and what are they accelerating ? ''",
    "is one of eleven science questions for the new century in physics and astronomy @xcite . in the last few years important",
    "progress has been made in measuring the properties of .",
    "in particular , the results of the have significantly contributed to an improvement in understanding the origin of the highest - energy particles in the universe .",
    "the discovery of correlations between the arrival directions of cosmic rays and the positions of agn was among the most important scientific breakthroughs in 2007 for several science media organizations , see [ www.auger.org/news/top_news_2007.html ] .",
    "the must important findings discussed in this overview may be summarized as follows .",
    "the structures in the energy spectrum at highest energies seem to become more clear .",
    "in particular , there seems to be evidence for a steeper falling spectrum above @xmath93  ev ( and [ espek ] ) .",
    "the question arises whether this steepening is due to the gzk effect or due to the maximum energy achieved during the acceleration processes . the most convincing evidence for the existence of the gzk effect is provided by the correlations of the arrival directions with agn .",
    "they occur sharply above an energy of 57  eev . at this energy , the flux measured by the is about 50% lower than expected from a power law extrapolation from lower energies ,",
    "thus , there seems to be a connection between the steepening in the spectrum and the agn correlation .",
    "the correlations occur on an angular scale of about 3.2 .",
    "this indicates that the particles are deflected marginally only . in turn , this implies they should be light particles , with low @xmath10 , see and .",
    "however , there is some tension between this expectation and the measurements of the average depth of the shower maximum ( ) .",
    "the data at @xmath93  ev are compatible with a mixed composition .",
    "but , since the correlations occur relatively sharp above 57  eev , some dramatic change in composition above this energy can also not be excluded .",
    "the correlation implies that the sources of particles are in our cosmological neighborhood ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the gzk horizon , defined as the distance from earth which contains the sources that produce 90% of the protons that arrive with energies above a certain threshold is 90  mpc at 80  eev and 200  mpc at 60  eev @xcite .",
    "there seems to be a slight mismatch between these numbers and the auger findings .",
    "shifting upward the auger energy scale by about 30% , as indicated by some simulations of the reconstruction procedures @xcite , a better agreement between the predicted gzk horizon and energy threshold with the observed data could be achieved @xcite .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in the absolute energy scale of the is the knowledge of the fluorescence yield . at present ,",
    "intensive efforts are conducted by various groups to precisely determine the fluorescence yield of electrons in air @xcite .",
    "attention is paid to the dependence of the yield on atmospheric parameters , like pressure , temperature , and humidity .",
    "in particular , upcoming results from the airfly experiment @xcite are expected to significantly reduce the uncertainties of the energy scale for fluorescence detectors .",
    "the correlation between the arrival directions and the positions of agn sets constraints on models for the acceleration of particles .",
    "the results imply that the spatial distribution of sources is correlated with the distribution of agn .",
    "thus , already some scenarios are strongly disfavored",
    ". ruled out are models proposing sources in our galaxy , like neutron stars @xcite , pulsars @xcite , and black holes @xcite .",
    "models for sources in the galactic halo are also ruled out such as top - down scenarios with decaying super - heavy particles @xcite .",
    "these models are also severely constraint by the upper limits on the photon flux ( ) and the neutrino flux ( ) . within the next years measurements of photons and neutrinos produced in the gzk effect seem to be in reach .",
    "their detection would be an important and complementary information about the origin and propagation of .    in summary , the acceleration of ultra high - energy particles in agn seems to be very attractive , different scenarios have been proposed , e.g.@xcite .",
    "however , other sources with a similar spatial distribution are not excluded .    with the energy density estimated in",
    "we obtain a total cosmic ray power of about @xmath134  erg / s within a sphere ( @xmath135  mpc ) seen by the at the highest energies .",
    "the typical power in the jets of agn is of order of @xmath136 to @xmath137  erg / s @xcite .",
    "if we assume about 10% of this power is converted into cosmic rays , about 1 to 10 sources are needed to sustain the power of the observed extragalactic cosmic ray flux within a distance of 75  mpc from earth . if the efficiency is slightly smaller , the number of sources required is correspondingly slightly larger",
    ". has been estimated @xcite . ] if the sources of the highest - energy particles are indeed related to agn , the number of correlated events seen by the seems to be of the right order of magnitude and one expects to see in future more events from the same sources .    when the number of correlated events found in the auger data is compared to expectations for the agasa and hires experiments",
    ", one has to be aware of the different energy scales , see .",
    "the energy scales of the agasa and hires experiment are shifted relative to the by about 42% and 20% , respectively . if the auger prescription is applied to the data of these experiments , the energy threshold has to be adjusted correspondingly .",
    "[ [ in - the - next - years ] ]   in the next years + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    several experiments focus on the exploration of the energy region of the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ( @xmath0 to @xmath7  ev ) .",
    "the 0.5  km@xmath69 kascade - grande experiment @xcite is taking data since 2004 @xcite .",
    "the ice detector ice cube @xcite at the south pole and its 1  km@xmath69 surface air shower detector ice top @xcite are under construction . in january 2008 40",
    "ice cube strings and 40 surface detectors have been deployed , which implies the set - up is already 50% completed .",
    "further experiments are the telescope array @xcite and its low energy extension tale , as well as extensions of the to lower energies @xcite . with this",
    "new high - quality data more detailed information will be available on the energy spectrum and the composition and it should be possible to distinguish between different scenarios for the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays .    a promising complementary detection method for high - energy cosmic rays is the measurement of radio emission from air showers .",
    "this method provides three - dimensional information about air showers , similar to the fluorescence technique , but with the advantage of a much higher duty cycle . in the next years air showers",
    "are expected to be detected with the lofar radio observatory @xcite . an extensive research and development program",
    "is conducted in the pierre auger collaboration with the goal to build a 20  km@xmath69 radio antennae array @xcite .",
    "the southern site of the covers only a part of the whole sky , see . since the distribution of matter in the universe is different in the parts seen from the northern and southern hemispheres it is important to observe the whole sky .",
    "the northern auger observatory is designed to complete and extend the investigations begun in the south @xcite . to unambiguously identify the sources of the highest - energy cosmic rays",
    "requires collecting many more events in spite of the steeply falling energy spectrum .",
    "the planned northern site will be located in southeast colorado , usa , having an instrumented area several times the area of auger south .",
