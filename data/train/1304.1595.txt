    "the standard model of particle theory postulates the existence of at least one complex vacuum scalar field ( the higgs field ) , in order to generate certain masses in a gauge - invariant manner , mainly in the weak sector , through spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "direct experimental support of this field comes from the discovery of the associated field quantum , the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "extension of the standard model to supersymmetric or grand unified theories will bring in still more complex vacuum fields .",
    "we may therefore suppose that the universe is permeated with complex scalar fields , whose manifestation in the large has not been the preoccupation of particle theory , but is the main focus of this paper .    as we learn from condensed matter physics , a complex scalar field on the macroscopic scale gives rise to superfluidity .",
    "the field serves as an order parameter that expresses quantum phase coherence over macroscopic distances , and the superfluid velocity corresponds to the gradient of the phase of the complex field . from this point of view",
    ", we must view the universe as superfluid .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that this cosmic superfluidity offers explanations to both  dark energy \" and  dark matter \" :    * dark energy is the energy density of the cosmic superfluid , which drives an accelerated expansion of the universe ; * dark matter is the manifestation of local density variations of the superfluid , which are detectable through gravitational lensing .    in this paper , we formulate and apply a phenomenological theory of dark matter based on this picture .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", the dark - energy aspect is explored in a model using a self - interacting scalar field coupled to gravity through einstein s equation with robertson - walker metric , in the era immediately following the big bang .",
    "the robertson - walker metric sets the only length scale in the problem , and the field potential must change with this scale through quantum field - theoretic renormalization . for mathematical consistency ,",
    "one requires that the potential be asymptotically free ( i.e. , vanish in the small - distance limit , ) and this determines it to be the halpern - huang potential @xcite derived from renormalization - group studies .",
    "it is a non - polynomial potential with exponential behavior for large fields , a feature leading to the generation of an effective cosmological constant that decrease in time like a power , and this gives dark energy ( accelerated expansion of the universe ) , while avoiding the usual  fine - tuning \" problem .",
    "the same model gives a new scenario of the inflation era @xcite .",
    "after the big bang , matter ( modeled as a perfect fluid coupled to the scalar field ) was created in the quantum turbulence of the cosmic superfluid , in the form of a vortex tangle .",
    "it grows and decays in about 10@xmath0s , and is described phenomenologically by vinen s equation originally used in liquid helium .",
    "the inflation era corresponds to the lifetime of quantum turbulence , during which the radius of the universe increases by a factor @xmath1 , and all the matter needed for subsequently nucleosynthesis was created . at the end of the inflation era ,",
    "the usefulness of this model is ended , for density variations in the universe became important .",
    "the model passes control to the standard hot big bang theory , with an important condition : the universe remains a superfluid , and all astrophysical processes take place in this superfluid .    the foregoing describes how the cosmic superfluid comes into being , and its role during the inflation era .",
    "now we have to describe it post inflation , in which conditions have become somewhat different .",
    "the big bang era was governed by the planck scale of 10@xmath2gev , which was built into einstein s equation through the robertson - walker metric . with the emergence of matter",
    "comes the nucleon mass scale of 1 gev .",
    "this scale ultimately arises in scale - invariant qcd through spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry  an effect referred to as  dimensional transmutation \" .",
    "( the observable mass of the universe comes mainly from protons and neutrons , and has little to do with the higgs . )",
    "since the matter length scale is much smaller than the planck scale , it should prevail in the dynamics of stars and galaxies .",
    "the decoupling between the nuclear scale and the planck scale is illustrated in ref.@xcite . in the present work , which is largely concerned with the present universe ,",
    "we simply ignore the influence of the planck scale , and use a simple @xmath3 theory with constant phenomenological coupling constants .    in principle , one should use an updated halpern - huang potential , with needed renormalization to bridge the planck era and the present . everything that happens between then and now",
    " the expansion of the universe , emergence of the matter scale , interactions between matter and the scalar field  will contribute to this  running \" of the potential , with the length scale expanding by 18 orders of magnitude .",
    "we bypass this problem here by adopting the phenomenological @xmath3 potential .",
    "the order parameter originates in landau s @xcite theory of phase transitions , in which a high - temperature phase with less  order \" ( i.e. , higher degree of symmetry ) changes into a low - temperature phase with more  order \" ( less symmetry ) , through what is now called spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the order parameter is something that gives a measure of  order \" , and it vanishes above the critical temperature .",
    "the generic example is the magnetic moment density in a paramagnetic phase transition , which can be represented by a scalar field @xmath4 with a symmetric field potential @xmath5 , which has only one minimum with @xmath6 at high temperatures , but exhibits two minima at nonzero values @xmath7 below the critical temperature .",
    "this is a phenomenological way to describe spontaneous symmetry breaking . in the ginsburg - landau theory of superconductivity @xcite ,",
    "the order parameter is a complex scalar field coupled to the electromagnetic field , and it successfully describes the meissner effect , in which the photon acquires mass inside a superconductor .",
    "( this is the first instance of the so - called  higgs mechanism \" . )",
    "we now know that this order parameter corresponds to the complex wave function of cooper pairs in the microscopic bcs theory @xcite , and the ginsburg - landau theory has been derived @xcite from bcs .",
    "however , it continues to serve as an indispensable practical tool .",
    "the landau approach is also important for understanding superfluidity in liquid helium and cold - trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "the order parameter in this case is the complex wave function of the bose - einstein condensate , and it obeys the gross - pitaevskii equation , an instance of the nlse ( nonlinear schrdinger equation ) first used in nonlinear optics @xcite .    in our investigation here , we consider a generic complex scalar field in curved space - time , which may correspond to some vacuum field in particle theories , such as supersymmetry or grand unified theories .",
    "we assume that the field obey the nonlinear klein - gordon equation ( nlkg ) in curved space - time .",
    "we shall discuss the definition of superfluid density and superfluid velocity in a relativistic setting .",
    "matter will be treated as a perfect fluid with given density current , interacting with the scalar field via current - current interaction . in this work",
    "we have not considered the dynamics of matter itself .",
    "the nlkg describes a pure superfluid at absolute zero temperature . at higher temperatures",
    ", there will appear a normal fluid , consisting of phonons , field quanta , as well as particles coupled to it , existing with the superfluid in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the so - called wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) searched for in particle - physics setups @xcite would be a component of our normal fluid , if they exist , and this would explain how they came to permeate all space .",
    "however , we have not taken the normal fluid into account in this paper .",
    "the most persuasive evidence for dark matter is the detection of galactic halos via gravitational lensing . in our picture , the dark - matter halo is made up of extra superfluid drawn around a galaxy , due to attractions between galaxy and superfluid .",
    "the halo can follow the motion of a galaxy like a  soliton \" .",
    "it can follow the rotation of a galaxy by developing quantized vortices .",
    "when two galaxies collide , their halos will merge and undergo contortions .",
    "all these phenomena are part of the superfluid hydrodynamics that follows from the nlkg .",
    "observed dark matter formations like the so - called  bullet cluster \" @xcite and  train wreck \" @xcite are , in our picture , manifestations of superfluid hydrodynamics .",
    "the main topics investigated in this paper are    * fitting model parameters to cosmological data , * dark matter in galactic halos , * quantized superfluid vortices , * numerical simulations of dark - matter halos , galaxy collisions , vortices .",
    "we use units in which @xmath8 , and a metric corresponding to @xmath9 in flat space - time .",
    "the vacuum complex scalar field is denoted by @xmath10 the classical lagrangian density in the absence of galactic matter is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the metric tensor , and @xmath13 is the self - interaction potential .",

    "it is easy to see that the action ( [ phiaction ] ) has a global u(1 ) symmetry since the potential @xmath21 is invariant under the transformation @xmath22 .    in flat space - time , in the absence of galactic matter , the equation of motion is the nonlinear klein - gordon equation ( nlkg ) @xmath23 with a conserved current density @xmath24 in the presence of a galaxy ( a generic term that includes a star ) , we add to the lagrangian density an interaction term @xmath25 , which represents the non - gravitational interaction between galaxy and scalar field .",
    "( gravity will be included in the next section ) .",
    "the galaxy is introduced as an external source , with a given energy current density @xmath26 .",
    "its interaction with the scalar field is described phenomenologically through a current - current interaction , as dictated by lorentz covariance : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a coupling constant , and @xmath26 is a four - vector : @xmath29 where the given function @xmath30 describes the density profile of the galaxy .",
    "note that from ( [ current ] ) and ( [ jmujmu ] ) we have @xmath31 which has , from particle physics point of view , the typical form of a coupling between the noether current @xmath26 from the normal matter sector and the nambu - goldstone boson @xmath32 , if the u(1 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken .",

    "when analyzed in terms of legendre polynomials @xmath49 , the angular distribution of thermal fluctuations in the cmb shows a peak at @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "now , the angular pattern @xmath49 divides the circle into @xmath51 sectors , each subtending an angle @xmath52 , and stuff within this angle should be correlated .",
    "so the correlation length would be of the order of @xmath53where @xmath54 cm is the distance of last scattering . putting @xmath55 , we get @xmath56 cm , which is not inconsistent with ( [ corr00 ] ) , considering the qualitative nature of the argument .",
    "the nlkg here is a field equation , and is quite different from the relativistic n - body equations used in astrophysics .",

    "a galaxy immersed in the cosmic superfluid will become surrounded by a halo of higher superfluid density than the vacuum . this can be observed through gravitational lensing , and interpreted by us as dark matter .    to see how the halo is formed , consider the situation in which a hypothetical galaxy had been formed in the vacuum scalar field long enough",
    "for the entire system to develop into a stationary state .",

    "what actually happens is that a dark - matter halo will initially develop around the galaxy and spread , as illustrated schematically in fig.1 .",
    "the initial speed of the spreading is the velocity of light , the character speed in the nlkg , but it will be slowed or stopped by gravitational interactions . to estimate the overall average speed , we assume that the halos around galaxies emerged with their formation , some @xmath80 years ago . we take the present radius to be 10 times galactic radius , or 10@xmath81 ly , judging from gravitational lensing pictures @xcite .",

    "we may assume that the stationary equation ( [ stationary ] ) approximately holds within the halo , but of course it becomes invalid in the transition region and beyond .",

    "initially the layer would grow at the speed of light , the characteristic speed of the nlkg , but eventually it would be slowed or stopped by self gravitation of the layer , and the gravitational attraction from the galaxy .",
    "this could produce the  squashed beach ball \" shape of the halo around the milky way @xcite .",
    "the process is schematically illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "the universe roughly consists of 3/4 dark energy and 1/4 dark matter . since dark energy and dark matter are manifestations of the same scalar field , that fact imposes relations that can be tested .",
    "in the following we regard dark matter and halo as the same . let @xmath87 where @xmath39 denotes mass density .",

    "thus @xmath90 which leads to the relation @xmath91 using the values @xmath92 from @xcite and @xcite",
    "respectively , we get @xmath93 since each galaxy occupies a volume the size of its halo , we should have @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the radius of the universe , and @xmath96 is the number of galaxies . equating the above to @xmath97 and then solving for @xmath98",

    "similarly , a macroscopic object can move through a superfluid without friction , as long as its relative velocity is below the critical velocity , which is usually the phonon velocity associated with long - wavelength excitations , or goldstone modes . for our cosmic superfluid ,",
    "this is the velocity of light , and thus stars in a galaxy should be able to move frictionlessly through the dark - matter halo , since the latter is part of the superfluid .",
    "on the other hand , a superfluid can be induced to rotation about an axis , by creating quantized vortices in the superfluid ( see below ) .    in non - relativistic theories ,",
    "the superfluid velocity is defined by @xmath110 , where @xmath32 is the phase of the complex order parameter , and @xmath106 a mass . however , this is not bounded by the velocity of light , and clearly needs modification in the relativistic domain . in flat space - time , we generalize it as follows .",

    "the core size of the vortex line is proportional to the correlation length , which is @xmath85 inside the galactic halo , and increases as we go away from the center of the halo , and approach the larger vacuum value @xmath45 outside the halo .",
    "the transition layer between the halo and the vacuum may be regarded as a fuzzy boundary where a vortex line can  terminate \" .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "the halo of a galaxy with one vortex would look like a fat donut with a tiny hole .",
    "the picture might be different for a black hole , for which the strong space - time curvature may have important effects on vorticity .",
    "we can roughly estimate the critical angular velocity for the creation of one vortex , using a cylindrical geometry . consider a circular loop @xmath133 of radius @xmath137 , with an infinite vortex line normal to the loop through its center .",

    "the basic idea of this model is that the universe is filled with a superfluid , which is described by a vacuum complex scalar field , and dark matter is a manifestation of density fluctuations of the superfluid .",
    "this idea has similarities with previous theories that describe dark matter as a bose - einstein condensate of some kind @xcite .",
    "the difference is that our superfluid is relativistic and fills the entire universe , and , as described in @xcite , had its origin in the big bang , and played a critical role in the creation of matter through vortex activities .",
    "the big - bang theory gives a hubble parameter that decays in time like a power law .",
    "such a behavior has been postulated phenomenologically under the name of  intermediate inflation \" , and compared with observations @xcite .    during the big - bang era , it was essential to use a scalar potential that is asymptotically free , because the length scale was inflating rapidly . in the present universe , however , we can describe the superfluid by a phenomenological nlkg , with any convenient potential .",
    "the preliminary investigation here aims mainly to show that it passes first encounters with observations , and establish some parameters in the nlkg .",
    "important limitations of our model are the following : it treats the superfluid at absolute zero , ignoring the normal fluid component ; and it treats matter as external source , ignoring its dynamics .",
    "the normal fluid will consist of phonons of the goldstone modes described earlier , the quanta of the scalar field , with mass given by ( [ quanta ] ) , and elementary particles coupled to the scalar field , for example the wimps that particle physicists are searching for .",
    "if they exist , their excitation from the superfluid would explain why they are expect to gather around galaxies , but they are only secondary components of dark matter .",
    "the present model can not explain the velocity curve of andromeda @xcite , the earliest indication of dark matter , which shows that  dust \" surrounding the galaxy has a velocity too large to be accounted for by the visible galactic mass . to do that , we need an equation of motion for matter .    in a more general sense ,",
    "a extension of the present model should look towards the inclusion of cosmic superfluidity into a hot big bang theory , and analysis of the cmb .",
    "one would add the nlkg to any quantitative treatment .",
    "clearly , this would be major project yet to be undertaken .",
    "we can only speculate on the effects of the cosmic superfluidity in the hot big bang scenarios , and cmb fluctuations .",
    "they would have little influence on small - scale phenomena , such as the nuclear and electromagnetic processes in nucleosynthesis and barogenesis @xcite , and the bao ( baryon acoustic oscillations ) in the cmb @xcite .",
    "the main impact would be associated with quantized vorticity , which could leave imprints on the cmb , and play a role in structure formation in the universe .",
