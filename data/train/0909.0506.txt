    "asteroseismology of solar - type stars promises significant improvements in our understanding of stellar evolution theory . by using asteroseismic data on stars showing solar - like oscillations , in combination with more traditional non - seismic data ,",
    "it is possible to constrain the fundamental stellar parameters to levels of precision that would not otherwise be possible .",
    "there are strong synergies with exoplanet studies , in that the asteroseismic data can place tight constraints on the ages and angular momenta of exoplanetary systems , and also help to place tight constraints on the exoplanet radii ( e.g. , see kjeldsen et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "accurate , high - precision results on fundamental parameters of stars showing solar - like oscillations have already been demonstrated with asteroseismic data from ground - based campaigns ( e.g. , bedding et al .",
    "long ( multi - month ) high - quality datasets from the corot satellite ( baglin et al .",
    "2006 ) are now being exploited for a selection of f - type main - sequence stars showing solar - like oscillations ( e.g. , michel et al .",
    "2008 ; appourchaux et al .",
    "but it is with the nasa discovery - class kepler mission ( borucki et al .",
    "2008 ) that we will be able to perform a proper `` seismic survey '' of the solar - like part of the color - magnitude diagram , thanks to the large number of stars it will observe for asteroseismology .    kepler was launched successfully on 2009 march 7 .",
    "in addition to searching for earth - like exoplanets via the transit method , the kepler asteroseismology science consortium ( kasc ) will have an unprecedented opportunity to study more than one - thousand stars showing solar - like oscillations ( christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "2008a , b ) .",
    "this large volume of data will be collected during the initial survey phase , when the solar - like targets will each be observed for one month .",
    "these targets have been selected from the kepler input catalogue ( kic ; see brown et al .",
    "2005 ) . on completion of the survey phase",
    ", a subset of approximately 50 to 75 solar - like targets will be selected for continuous multi - year observations , ideally through the duration of the rest of the mission .    the asteroflag consortium ( chaplin et al .",
    "2008a ) has been at the forefront of developing semi- and fully - automated analysis pipelines for the solar - like kepler data .",
    "an automated approach is strongly indicated , due to the large number of survey phase targets .",
    "stello et al . ( 2009 ) described a variety of pipeline approaches for kepler , most of them automated , to constrain the radii of solar - like stars using the principal frequency spacings of the oscillation spectra as the seismic inputs .",
    "the pipelines were tested on artificial f , g and k main - sequence stars , in a series of asteroflag hare - and - hounds exercises .    in this paper , we describe our pipeline , the yale - birmingham ( yb ) pipeline , for determining stellar radii using a mixture of seismic inputs and conventional stellar parameters .",
    "we test the pipeline using new stellar models , in addition to updated versions of the asteroflag hare - and - hounds models ; and use an additional seismic input not adopted previously , the frequency of maximum oscillation power .",
    "this paper also adopts levels of precision expected for the one - month survey phase data .",
    "( detailed information on the survey phase strategy was not to hand when much of the work for stello et al .",
    "was conducted . )",
    "we also analyse the effect on the inferred radii of the sizes of the errors in the different inputs .",
    "a systematic study of this type , which incorporates non - seismic _ and _ seismic inputs , has not been presented in detail before and is needed to determine which non - seismic parameters are most important for an accurate radius determination .",
    "we test our pipeline on artificial stars at all stages of evolution  from the main sequence to the red giant branch .",
    "we have organised the rest of the paper as follows .",
    "we discuss how we determine stellar radii in section  [ sec : method ] , and we evaluate the effect of the errors on input variables in section  [ sec : test ] . in section  [ sec : sys ] we analyse some known sources of systematic errors .",
    "we show results from a blind test in section  [ sec : hh ] .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "analysis of data on each solar - like kepler target will provide a set of observational input parameters .",
    "we consider the case where two seismic input parameters are available : the so - called large frequency spacing , @xmath0 , and the frequency of maximum oscillation power , @xmath1 .",
    "we discuss these seismic parameters below .",
    "we also assume the following non - seismic parameters are available : the effective temperature , @xmath2 , the luminosity ( or rather the apparent magnitude , @xmath3 , and parallax , @xmath4 ) , and the metallicity @xmath5 .",
    "when the first solar - like analyses are performed on kepler data , for most stars these non - seismic data will come from the kepler input catalogue ( kic ) ( note that parallaxes , from kepler astrometry , will follow later ) . unlike some of the methods discussed in stello et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we do not use @xmath6 since estimates of this quantity can be unreliable .",
    "however , as can be seen later , we could easily add that variable to the list .",
    "the frequency power spectra of oscillations in solar - type stars present a pattern of peaks with near regular spacings .",
    "the signatures of these spacings are quite amenable to extraction , owing to their regularity .",
    "the large frequency spacings , @xmath0 , are the spacings between consecutive overtones , @xmath7 , having the same spherical angular degree , @xmath8 , and are related to the acoustic radii of the stars .",
    "when the signal - to - noise ratios in the seismic data are insufficient to allow robust extraction of individual oscillation frequencies , it is still possible to extract estimates of the large frequency spacings for use as the seismic input data .",
    "we design our method for this eventuality , using an average value of the spacing as the principal seismic input .",
    "this is all that we can expect to get for many of the main - sequence targets observed by kepler in its survey phase .",
    "the large spacing is formally related to the mean density of a star ( see e.g. , christensen - dalsgaard 1993 ) .",
    "it scales as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total mass and @xmath11 the radius of the star .    if available we also use @xmath1 , the frequency of maximum power in the oscillation power spectrum .",
    "the frequency of maximum oscillation power is related to the acoustic cut - off frequency of a star ( e.g. , see kjeldsen & bedding 1995 ; bedding & kjeldsen 2003 ; chaplin et al .",
    "2008b ) , which in turn scales as @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is the effective temperature , and hence contains information about a star s radius .    in order to estimate the radius ,",
    "given the input parameters , we make use of a large , fixed grid of stellar evolutionary models . our method is based on finding , in some sense , the maximum likelihood of the set of input parameters calculated with respect to the grid of models .",
    "the likelihood function is formally defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17 where in eq .",
    "[ eq : likepi ] above we have assumed at all errors are due to errors in @xmath4 ( adding errors in @xmath3 can be done easily ) , @xmath18 and finally @xmath19 as can be seen from the form of the likelihood function in eq .",
    "[ eq : like ] , we can easily include more variables , or drop other variables .",
    "the grid of evolutionary models used are from the yale - yonsei ( yy ) isochrones ( see demarque et al .  2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the models were constructed with a mixing length parameter of @xmath20 , opal high temperature opacities ( rogers & iglesias 1995 ; iglesias & rogers 1996 ) and alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) low temperature opacities .",
    "the opal equation of state ( rogers et al . 1996 ) was used .",
    "the models include diffusion .",
    "core overshoot of @xmath21 is included .",
    "the models assume the solar mixture of grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) and the yy solar model has @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "higher @xmath24 models were made assuming @xmath25 .",
    "we use the models where the conversion of luminosities to absolute visual magnitude was made using the colour tables of lejeune et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the grid of yy models that we have used have [ fe / h ] of 0 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 } = \\log(z / x ) - \\log(z / x)_{\\odot}$ ] ) .",
    "the helium abundance of these models were determined assuming @xmath35 .",
    "we have also restricted the grid to models with ages between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the lower age limit ensures that we do not have too many pre - main sequence models , although we do not avoid them completely .",
    "we show the grid we use in figure  [ fig : hrd ] .",
    "there are about 95000 models in the grid .",
    "the average large frequency spacings @xmath0 of these models were estimated by simply scaling from the average solar value , using the aforementioned @xmath9 scaling .",
    "the alternative would be to first calculate the pulsational frequencies of each model , and from these determine an average large frequency spacing .",
    "however , it turns out that the simple scaled values are more than adequate for this work , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : scale ] where we compare for a representative subset of models the large spacing obtained from the scaling relationship to the actual average large spacing from the calculated frequencies .",
    "the scaling relation clearly works well .",
    "a small deviation is seen for some of the hotter models .",
    "this does not concern us much since such hot stars are unlikely to show pulsations .",
    "when we also made use of the frequency of maximum oscillation power , @xmath1 , as part of the input parameter set we estimated its value for each model by again scaling from the average solar value of @xmath38 using the aforementioned @xmath12 scaling .",
    "the first key step of our method is based on generating 10,000 input parameter sets by adding different random realisations of gaussian noise to the actual ( central ) observational input parameter set described at the beginning of this section .",
    "this is to allow us to make a proper determination of the errors involved .",
    "the use of these randomly perturbed parameter sets also allows us to account for the fact that the relation between the radius of a star and its other properties , such as @xmath2 , metallicity and luminosity , is extremely non - linear .",
    "thus , while the 10,000 perturbed parameter sets are created by adding gaussian noise , the distribution of radii obtained from the perturbed sets does not usually have a gaussian distribution .",
    "the distribution of radii obtained from the central parameter set and the 10,000 perturbed parameter sets is what we refer to in the rest of the paper as the `` distribution function . ''",
    "we settled on the number 10,000 as a compromise between obtaining an eventual smooth distribution of radii in a reasonable computational time , given one set of input variables .    for the central input parameter set and each of the perturbed sets we calculate the likelihood , @xmath39 , for models within 3@xmath40 of the variables of each set .",
    "note that we only choose models that have characteristics within 3@xmath40 of _ all _ the variables .",
    "we have a pre - defined minimum over which we calculate the likelihood to avoid problems associated with a discrete grid of models .",
    "we find that the @xmath41 limit is sufficient , with the added benefit that it saves on computer time , since fewer models are involved ( e.g. , results obtained using @xmath41 limits lie well within the errors of those given for the @xmath42 limits ) .",
    "for the cases we have described below , a few hundred of the 95000 models contribute to the likelihood function when seismic constraints are present . in the absence of seismic constraints ,",
    "the number of models that contribute to the likelihood function rises to a few thousand .",
    "the likelihood can be described as a function of the radius of the model that is used to calculate it .",
    "since we use a discrete grid of models , we obtain a discrete likelihood distribution function , i.e. , a distribution function made up of calculated values of @xmath39 for each of the tested models from the discrete model grid .",
    "fitting a functional form and then determining the maximum likelihood is time consuming , and using the maximum of the distribution function of @xmath39 gives biases that vary across the hr diagram .",
    "we therefore define the inferred radius of a given set of inputs to be the centre of gravity of the distribution function .",
    "once we have inferred the radius for each of the 10,001 variable sets ( again : one central set and 10,000 perturbed sets ) , we can plot the distribution function of the radii ( see below ) .",
    "we choose the second quartile point of the function as the final value of the radius and the inter - quartile distances as the errors on the solution .    to test whether our method works , we first tried to determine the solar radius using the solar large spacing obtained from solar @xmath43 frequencies measured by the birmingham solar - oscillations network ( chaplin et al .",
    "in particular we use the mode set bison-1 described in basu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to determine an the average large spacing calculated between 2.47mhz and 3.82mhz for use as a seismic input parameter .",
    "the interval was chosen to be roughly ten large spacings centred around the frequency of maximum power .",
    "this choice is prompted by what we can expect from kepler in the survey phase .",
    "for the purposes of determining likelihood functions @xmath39 , and subsequently the distribution function of these @xmath39 , we assumed that the sun has a parallax of @xmath44mas , and that the errors in the effective temperature , @xmath45 and @xmath0 are 200k , 0.2dex and 0.56@xmath46hz , respectively .",
    "we also conducted a second exercise were we reduced all the errors by a factor of two .",
    "these errors are representative of a `` typical '' solar - like main - sequence target for kepler ( see also section  [ sec : hh ] below ) .",
    "computed parallaxes of our tests were fixed according to the known apparent magnitude range for selected solar - like survey phase targets , i.e. , roughly @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "note that the precision in the parallax has been chosen to be similar to that in the existing hipparcos catalogue ( at the same apparent magnitude ) , very likely a pessimistic estimate of the precision we might expect to obtain from kepler astrometry .",
    "since our initial aim was to check whether the method works , rather than to assess the effect of errors , we did not add random errors to the input parameters ( i.e. , the true , underlying input parameters ) , which would have more closely mimiced the case of real observations .",
    "the estimated errors on the input parameters were used only to choose the grid models for the likelihood function , and to generate the randomly perturbed models ( see above ) used to calculate the distribution function .",
    "section  [ sec : hh ] describes the result of an exercise where data with added random errors were used as inputs .",
    "figure  [ fig : likely](a ) shows the models of our grid that were used to calculate the likelihood function for the central bison values , in the larger error case ; figure  [ fig : likely](b ) shows the values of the likelihood function against the radius of the models .",
    "390 models contribute to the likelohood function .",
    "as can be seen , the function is well peaked , however , the discrete nature of the grid makes the process of finding the location of the maximum rather unstable ( and stable ways are time - consuming and unpractical given , the large volumes of real kepler data we expect ) , hence we choose to use the centre of gravity of the distribution , which in the figure is indicated by the vertical line .",
    "figure  [ fig : likely](c ) shows the 10,000 models generated to construct the distribution function .",
    "the distribution function is constructed by first calculating the likelihood function for each of the models and finding the centre of gravity of each function .",
    "the two distribution functions are plotted in figure  [ fig : bison ] .",
    "we have plotted the distribution functions against the deviation from @xmath49 to give a clearer understanding of the errors .",
    "the radius can be read from the top of the figure .",
    "the first thing to note is that the distribution functions are definitely not gaussian , and are asymmetric .",
    "this is expected given the non - linear relationship between the radius of a star and its temperature , metallicity and luminosity .",
    "the solar radius we obtain from this exercise is @xmath50 for the large error case and @xmath51 for the smaller error case . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the solution is the second quartile point of the distribution and the errors represent the distance to the first and third quartile points .",
    "thus we are able to determine successfully the solar radius , demonstrating that the method works . in the following section we examine the behaviour of the distribution function for stars at various stages of their evolution and the effect of the input errors on the results .",
    "to determine what parameters affect radius determination the most , we performed a series of tests with different models .",
    "the models are listed in table  [ tab : teststars ] .",
    "we consider models at six different positions on the hr diagram , starting at the lower main sequence , right up to the red giant branch .",
    "the models used in this section are similar to the calibration models used .",
    "the effect of having different models is shown in subsequent sections .",
    "we use this section to examine the rle of the various input parameters and the errors on those parameters .",

    "we assume that the apparent magnitude of the star is known exactly and that all the error lies in the parallax measurement .",
    "however , since most kic stars do not have accurate parallaxes , we also determine what happens to the radius determination if we do not know the parallax at all .",

    "figure  [ fig : error ] shows the effect of the three error distributions ( errors  1 , 2 and 3 ) on the resultant distribution function .",
    "we remind the reader that the difference between the three errors lies in differences in the assumed parallax , and errors therein , as well as differences in the errors of the seismic variables . as can be seen from the figure , as expected ,",
    "the distribution with the smallest errors does the best .",
    "increasing errors does not merely widen the distribution function ( denoting larger statistical errors in the solution ) , it also shifts the peak away from the real solution ( denoting systematic errors ) .",

    ", estimates of effective temperature and absolute magnitudes need to be good to be able to get radii of red - giants accurately . given that many red giants in the kepler sample are expected to be bright enough to obtain individual frequencies even from relatively short time series ( mode amplitudes will be significantly higher than in the less luminous main - sequence targets )",
    ", detailed modelling of the individual frequencies should give better estimates of the radii of these stars .",
    "our radius - determination method uses a number of inputs , and the errors in the inputs affect the final result .",
    "we determine the effect of errors in the inputs by comparing the distribution functions obtained with error  2 with those obtained by reducing the error in each input variable one by one .",
    "the effect on the distribution function of errors in the seismic variables , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is shown in figures  [ fig : delnu ] and  [ fig : numax ] , respectively .",
    "the error in @xmath0 was reduced from @xmath52hz to @xmath53hz . as can be seen , reducing the error in @xmath0",
    "makes the distribution functions narrower , and hence the results more precise .",

    "failure to use @xmath2 is not an option .",
    "decreasing errors in @xmath2 by a factor of two , down to 100k , increases both the accuracy and precision of the results and additional improvement is obtained by decreasing @xmath55 further .",

    "the effect of metallicity is shown in figure  [ fig : zpar ] .",
    "we obtained the distributions using error  2 errors with and without @xmath5 .",
    "we also tried reducing the error in @xmath45 by a factor of two .",
    "the last case we tried assumed that the star has solar metallicity .",
    "this was prompted by the fact that the metallicity distribution of solar neighbourhood stars is peaked at very nearly solar metallicity .",
    "our results show , however , that not using @xmath5 at all gives better results than assuming solar metallicity .",
    "the difference is slight for main - sequence stars , but glaring for evolved stars .",
    "we find that we can not get a good radius measurement for evolved stars without a good knowledge of their metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : parlow ] shows the effect of errors in the parallax . reducing parallax errors",
    "does not affect the results of main - sequence stars and most sub giants too much .",
    "it does make a very large difference though in the case of red giants where the luminosity is basically determined by the radius given their narrow @xmath2 range . in the case of main - sequence stars ,",
    "the effect of even having a parallax is small .",
    "this is good news for initial analysis of kepler data , given that most of the stars in kic do not have reliable parallaxes ( though , as noted previously , we expect eventually to get parallax determinations from the kepler data ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : all ] summarises our results for the six test stars .",
    "we show results for each of the three error distributions as well as the results of using ( or not using ) certain inputs .",
    "we plot the deviation of the inferred radius from the actual radius of the model ; thus a difference from zero indicates immediately the systematic error in the result , while the error bars indicate the statistical errors .",
    "it can be seen that by using seismic inputs we can determine the radius of main sequence stars to within 1 to 2% .",
    "the error in the sub giants is somewhat higher , here about 5% .",
    "we fail pretty badly in the case of the red giant , except when the input errors are small ( i.e. , the error  1 case ) .",
    "the figure shows the non - seismic results too : except for the case of error  1 , the error in those results always exceeds 15% .",
    "the figure also shows that knowledge of @xmath2 and the seismic variables is sufficient to allow a good determination of the radii of main sequence stars .",
    "more information is required for sub giants and red giants  knowledge of @xmath5 for sub giants , and both @xmath5 and luminosity ( i.e. , apparent magnitude and parallax ) for red giants .",
    "a good knowledge of the parallax is essential to get red giant radii correctly .",
    "there are two possible sources of systematic errors in the radius determination , one is the so called `` surface term '' and the other is the effect of the mixing length parameter .",
    "we examine both these sources in this section .",
    "stellar models do not represent the near - surface layers of stars very well . among the problems",
    "is the use of the mixing length approximation to model convection .",
    "while this approximation works well in regions of efficient convection , it does not in regions where convection is not efficient , i.e. , the near - surface layers .",
    "the structure of the superadiabatic layer is incorrect ( nordlund & dravins 1990 ; freytag et al . 1996 ; abbett et al .",
    "1997 , etc . ) .",
    "in addition , stellar models do not include turbulent pressure that arises from convection , neither do they include the contribution due to turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "all these factors lead to errors in the models .",
    "near - surface errors of this kind lead to a frequency - dependent error in the frequencies ( see e.g. , christensen - dalsgaard & berthomieu 1991 ) usually referred to as the `` surface term ''",
    ". differences in near - surface opacities also contribute . to the contribution due to improper modelling",
    "is added the fact that frequencies of models are calculated assuming that they are adiabatic , another surface term since that is where adiabaticity breaks down .",
    "the surface term for various published solar models can be seen in figure  [ fig : surface ] .",
    "the models are listed in table  [ tab : solar ] .",
    "this figure shows frequency differences for modes with @xmath56 and @xmath57 between the models and the solar frequencies in the aforementioned bison-1 set , plotted as a function of frequency .",
    "as can be seen , the frequency differences are predominantly a function of frequency ; furthermore , different models have different surface terms .",
    "methods have been developed by helioseismologists to deal with the surface term in solar data ( e.g. , dziembowski et al .",
    "kjeldsen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have also recently proposed an empirical method for constraining the surface term using asteroseismic data _ only when _ estimates of individual mode frequencies are available .",
    "however , this is not an option for those kepler survey phase targets where we can only extract an estimate of the average large frequency spacing , and can not extract robust estimates of individual frequencies ( covering several radial orders ) .",
    "thus we might reasonably expect the radius determination in these stars to be affected , because of the effect of the surface term .",

    ", the differing surface terms do not affect the results much , and the systematic error is much less than 1% , and smaller than the statistical error .",
    "we do not therefore believe that we need to be worried about the surface term when dealing with data from the kepler survey phase .",
    "the results are , however , better than the bison results discussed in section  [ sec : method ] and perhaps we should consider those results as an indication of what systematic errors the surface term introduces .",
    "the radius of a stellar model depends on the mixing length parameter used to construct the model .",
    "unfortunately , there is no method to determine what the mixing length parameter should be : usually the mixing length parameter needed to reproduce the solar radius at the solar age is used for models of other stars too , and it is quite possible that this is not the correct thing to do .",

    "we used all inputs ( @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) to obtain the distribution functions .",
    "we can see that there are indeed shifts in the distribution function away from the true value , when a mismatch of the mixing lengths is present .",

    "first , we take the non - seismic inputs , i.e. , @xmath2 , @xmath45 , and @xmath4 . to the actual @xmath2 and @xmath45 we added a random gaussian",

    "true values of the parallax , @xmath4 , were calculated for two kepler apparent magnitudes , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "as noted previously , an hipparcos - like uncertainty was then assigned to each parallax , and the true value of the parallax perturbed ( in the manner described for @xmath2 and @xmath45 ) before the data were passed to sb .",
    "the seismic inputs came from tests conducted on artificial oscillation power spectra of the three cats , which were designed to mimic observations expected in the survey phase .",

    "the oscillation spectra of the cats differed from those used in stello et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in two important respects .",
    "first , the underlying oscillation amplitudes and damping rates were modified to more accurately reflect expected levels for the kepler observations ( e.g. , based on experience accumulated from analysing the corot data ) .",
    "second , artificial spectra were made to simulate those expected from observations lasting one month ( i.e. , the survey phase length ) , not the 3.5yr used in stello et al .",

    "robust estimation of the radii of red giants is extremely difficult .",
    "the narrow temperature range they occupy , and the sensitive dependence of the radii on luminosity , means that we must have a very precise knowledge of their temperature , and particularly their luminosity ( i.e. , we need to know their parallaxes very well ) to determine their radii accurately .",

    "our tests show that the much - feared `` surface term '' should not hamper the effort to determine stellar radii accurately from the kepler survey phase data .",
