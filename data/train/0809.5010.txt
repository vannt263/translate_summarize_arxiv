    "the hera @xmath0 collider , located in hamburg , germany , was in operation in the years @xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "protons with an energy up to @xmath4  gev were brought into collision with electrons or positrons of energy @xmath5  gev at two experiments , h1 and zeus , each of which collected a data sample with a total integrated luminosity of about @xmath6  fb@xmath7 .",
    "the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) interactions produced at hera , at a centre of mass energy @xmath8 of up to @xmath9  gev , provided an ideal environment to study rare processes , set constraints on the standard model ( sm ) and search for new particles and physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "searches performed by the h1 collaboration for leptoquarks , lepton flavour violating leptoquarks and excited fermions are presented in the following .",
    "analyses of other rare processes at hera are described elsewhere in these proceedings .",
    "the hera data provide the unique possibility to search for the resonant production of new particles that couple directly to a lepton and a parton .",
    "leptoquarks ( lqs ) , which appear naturally in various unifying bsm theories , are such an example . at hera",
    ", lqs may be resonantly produced in the @xmath10-channel up to the centre of mass energy or virtually exchanged in the @xmath11-channel between the initial state lepton and a quark coming from the proton . beyond the centre of mass energy the production mechanism proceeds via contact interactions .",
    "a search for lq production is performed by h1 in the @xmath12 lq framework of the buchmller , rckl and wyler ( brw ) model  @xcite , using the full h1 hera data set .",
    "lqs are classified in terms of fermion number @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the baryon and lepton number respectively . due to the more favourable density of quarks with respect to anti ",
    "quarks at high @xmath16 , the @xmath17 data are mostly sensitive to lqs with fermion number @xmath18 , whereas the @xmath19 data are more sensitive to @xmath20 lqs .",
    "h1 results based on hera  i data are presented in  @xcite .         in the search for first generation lqs ,",
    "the processes @xmath21 and @xmath22 are considered .",
    "these lq decays lead to final states similar to those of neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) dis interactions , which constitute an irreducible sm background .",
    "no signal is observed in the dis mass spectra and constraints on lq production are set , which extend beyond the previously excluded domains . for a yukawa coupling @xmath23 of electromagnetic strength , lq masses below @xmath24@xmath25  gev",
    "are ruled out by h1 , depending on the lq type  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lq ] presents the constraints on @xmath23 for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 lqs obtained by h1 as a function of lq mass , @xmath28 .",
    "limits from lep  @xcite are also shown , derived from indirect constraints on the process @xmath29 , as well as limits from the tevatron  @xcite , where lqs would be pair  produced via the strong interaction resulting in a production rate that is independent of @xmath23 . as mentioned above",
    ", contact interactions can also be used to describe the effects of virtual lq production or exchange at hera in the limit of large lq mass @xmath30 and indirect lq limits from the zeus contact interaction analysis  @xcite are also illustrated in figure  [ fig : lq ] .",
    "a search for lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) processes in @xmath31 collisions mediated by lqs is also performed by h1 . at hera , the lfv processes @xmath32 and @xmath33 may lead to final states with a muon or tau lepton , together with a hadronic jet .",
    "h1 results based on hera  i data are presented in  @xcite , where searches for both second and third generation lqs are included .",
    "a new search for second generation @xmath18 lqs using the complete h1 hera  ii @xmath17 data is presented here  @xcite .",
    "events are selected with a high @xmath34 muon and large missing calorimetric @xmath34 . the resulting lq mass spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : lfv ]  ( left ) .",
    "two candidate data events are observed in agreement with the sm prediction , which , in contrast to the first generation , is negligible . in the absence of a lq signal",
    ", limits are derived for the @xmath35 @xmath18 lq types as a function of @xmath28 . for yukawa couplings of electromagnetic strength , lfv lqs coupling to a muon ",
    "quark pair are ruled out for lq masses up to @xmath36  gev .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfv ]  ( right ) presents the constraints for the coupling @xmath37 for the @xmath26 lq obtained by h1 as a function of @xmath28 . a direct limit obtained at the tevatron from leptoquark pair production",
    "is also shown for comparison  @xcite .",
    "the existence of excited states of leptons and quarks is a natural consequence of models assuming composite fermions , and their discovery would provide convincing evidence of a new scale of matter .",
    "the production and decay of such particles is described in gauge  mediated ( gm ) and contact  interaction ( ci ) models .",
    "the excited electron decays @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 with subsequent hadronic or leptonic decays of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 bosons are examined at hera in a search for excited electrons by h1  @xcite . in this search , which uses the complete h1 @xmath0 data sample ,",
    "each decay channel is investigated and no indication of a signal is observed .",
    "new limits on the production cross section of excited electrons are obtained within a gm model  @xcite , where an upper limit on @xmath1 as a function of the excited electron mass is established for the specific relation @xmath43 between the couplings .",
    "assuming @xmath44 and @xmath45 excited electrons with a mass lower than @xmath46  gev are excluded at @xmath47  c.l , as shown in figure  [ fig : estar ]  ( left ) . also shown",
    "are direct  @xcite and indirect  @xcite exclusion limits obtained at lep , as well as a result from the tevatron  @xcite . for the first time in @xmath31 collisions , gauge and four  fermion contact interactions are also considered together for @xmath48 production and decays , assuming @xmath49 .",
    "the ci term improves the limit on @xmath50 only slightly , demonstrating that the gm mechanism is dominant for excited electron processes at hera , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : estar ]  ( right ) .",
    "a search for the production of excited neutrinos is performed by h1 , using the full @xmath17 data sample , integrated luminosity @xmath51  pb@xmath7  @xcite . due to the helicity dependence of the weak interaction and",
    "given the valence quark composition and density distribution of the proton , the @xmath52 production cross section is predicted to be much larger for @xmath53 collisions than for @xmath54 .",
    "the excited neutrino decay channels @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 with subsequent hadronic or leptonic decays of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 bosons are considered and no indication of a @xmath58 signal is found .",
    "upper limits on the coupling @xmath1 as a function of the excited neutrino mass are established within the gm model for specific relations between the couplings .",

    "is also indicated  @xcite .",
    "the excluded region is greatly extended with respect to previous results , based on only @xmath63  pb@xmath7 of @xmath17 data  @xcite , and demonstrates the unique sensitivity of hera to excited neutrinos with masses beyond the lep reach .",
    "finally , a search for excited quarks is performed using the full h1 @xmath0 data sample  @xcite .",
    "the electroweak decays of excited quarks @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 with subsequent hadronic or leptonic decays of the w and z bosons are considered .",
