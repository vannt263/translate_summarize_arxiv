    "the filamentary distributions of the galaxies and the web - like interconnections between the structures over different scales are collectively called the cosmic web phenomenon .",
    "the recent observations have disclosed the ubiquitous appearance of the cosmic web phenomena ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which agrees with the numerical results from @xmath0-body simulations for a standard @xmath1cdm cosmology where the energy density of the universe is contributed dominantly by the cosmological constant @xmath1 and the collisionless cold dark matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an urgently requested task in the field of the large scale structure is to find a tracer of the cosmic web with which the complicated filamentary pattern in the cosmic web can be coherently described and the key mechanism for the web interconnection can be quantitatively understood @xcite .    the velocity shear field proposed by @xcite as a new diagnostic of the web environment has recently drawn exploring attention .",
    "they suggested that the cosmic environments be classified into the four standard categories ( i.e. , knot , filament , sheet , void ) by putting some positive threshold on the three eigenvalues of the local velocity shear tensor and demonstrated with a high - resolution @xmath0-body simulation that the web environments classified by their algorithm reproduced the expected images of the four categories .",
    "but , there is no objective way to classify the cosmic web and thus it is quite subjective to claim that the velocity shear field is an optimal tracer of the cosmic web .",
    "it is worth mentioning here how the velocity shear field is different from the tidal shear field that was widely used as a tracer of the cosmic web in the previous approaches based on the classical cosmic web theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the tidal shear field defined as the second derivative of the gravitational potential is basically a linear quantity , obtained under the implicit assumption that the peculiar velocity field is curl free . whereas , the velocity shear field is an extension of the tidal shear field to the nonlinear regime where the velocity field develops a curl mode ( i.e. , vorticity ) . given that the cosmic web pattern penetrates deep into the nonlinear scales , the velocity shear field should trace better the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic web , being more suitable for the description of the interconnection over widely different scales @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of the velocity shear field as a tracer of the cosmic web has been noted by the subsequent numerical studies based on high - resolution n - body experiments .",
    "@xcite explained that the alignments between the shapes and angular momentum of the dark matter halos and the large - scale environments must have been mainly caused by the anisotropic gravitational collapse and accretion of dark matter along the minor principal axes of the velocity shear field .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the web interconnection should be a consequence of the stability of the velocity shear field against the change of the filtering scale .",
    "@xcite showed that the filamentary structures identified in their @xmath0-body simulations are indeed elongated along the minor principal axes of the velocity shear field .",
    "@xcite performed a more systematic investigation of the velocity shear effect on the generation of the cosmic web . noting that the presence of the cosmic web phenomena on all scales essentially implies that there are preferred directions in the occurrence of the accretion and merging events through which the structure formation proceeds in the standard @xmath1cdm picture , @xcite have shown by their @xmath0-body experiments that the infall and accretion events of the satellites always occur along the minor principal axes of the velocity shear field on all scales , no matter what environment the satellites are located and no matter what mass the satellites and hosts have .",
    "these works have provided theoretical explanations for the strong alignments between the spatial distribution of the satellites and the shapes of their hosts , which were shown by many @xmath0-body or hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the accretion of dark matter onto a host occurs along the direction of the minor principal axis of the _ small - scale _ velocity shear field , the shape of the host becomes elongated along that direction . as the infall of the satellites into the host occurs preferentially along the direction of the minor principal axis of the larger scale velocity shear field ,",
    "the spatial distributions of the satellites around the hosts are aligned with that direction . since the velocity shear field on two different scales are strongly cross - correlated @xcite , the shape of a host becomes aligned with the spatial distribution of its satellites .    although the alignments between the host shapes and the satellite locations have been supported by several observational studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no direct observational evidence was found for the preferential alignments of the satellite infall directions with the minor principal axes of the velocity shears nor for the strong cross - correlations between the velocity shear field smoothed on different scales .",
    "very recently , @xcite have found an observational evidence for the alignments between the infall directions of the satellite galaxies and the minor principal axes of the local velocity shear tensors .",
    "analyzing the spatial distribution of the satellite galaxies around the virgo cluster from the extended virgo cluster catalog ( evcc ) compiled by @xcite and determining the principal directions of the velocity shear tensor around the virgo cluster from the peculiar velocity field recently reconstructed by @xcite , they showed that the satellite galaxies located beyond the virial radius of the virgo cluster tend to reside in the plane perpendicular to the major principal axes of the local velocity shear tensor .    in their analysis ,",
    "however , @xcite projected the positions of the virgo satellites as well as the principal axes of the local velocity shear tensor onto the plane of the sky to eliminate the severe effect of nonlinear redshift space distortion expected to be present around the highly overdense region around the virgo .",
    "but , the minor principal axes of the local velocity shear at the virgo center turned out to be almost perpendicular to the line of sight direction and thus the true three dimensional direction was completely lost during the projection process . in consequence",
    ", what @xcite was able to find was not directly the alignments of the virgo satellites with the minor principal axis of the local velocity shear tensor but their anti - alignments with the major principal axis that almost lies in the plane of the sky .    in order to find",
    "a more direct observational evidence for the alignments between the satellite locations and the minor principal axes of the velocity shear field , it is necessary to consider those systems where the non - linear redshift effect is not severe . an isolated galactic system composed of a single host galaxy and its satellites should be a good target for this study .",
    "the nonlinear redshift distortion effect is expected to be less severe around a galaxy than in a cluster .",
    "furthermore , for the case of an _ isolated _ galactic system , its satellites can be readily identified by analyzing the spatial distributions of the galaxies around it .",
    "we attempt here to find a signal of the alignments between the locations of the galactic satellites around the isolated host galaxies and the minor principal axes of the velocity shear tensors measured at the positions of the hosts by analyzing the galaxy catalog from the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr7 ) @xcite . unlike in the work of @xcite",
    ", we will have to take a _ statistical approach _ rather than focusing on each galactic system since the number of the satellites around an isolated galaxy is much lower than that around a massive cluster like the virgo cluster .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "data ] , we describe the observational data used for our analysis . in section [ sec : analysis ] , we present an observational evidence for the alignments between the spatial distributions of the galactic satellites in isolated systems and the minor principal axes of the velocity shear field . in section [ sec : depend ] we explain if and how the strength of the satellite - shear alignments depends on the properties of the galactic satellites and their hosts and on the web environments as well . in section [ sec : con ] we discuss our results by comparing them with the recent numerical findings and draw a final conclusion . throughout this paper , we assume a flat @xmath1cdm universe whose initial conditions are described by the key cosmological parameters set at the values of @xmath2 .",
    "we construct a sample of the isolated galactic systems each of which consists of a single host and at least one satellite from the sdss dr7 spectroscopic datasets @xcite by following the procedure prescribed in @xcite .",
    "focusing on the local volume in the redshift range of @xmath3 , we select those galaxies as the hosts which are at least one magnitude brighter in the @xmath4-band than the survey limit , which amounts to putting a threshold @xmath5 as an upper limit on the @xmath4-band magnitudes , @xmath6 , of the sdss galaxies .",
    "the fainter galaxies with @xmath7 are excluded from our sample of the host galaxies since the satellite selection should be very incomplete for the case of those fainter galaxies ( see below for the satellite selection procedure ) .",
    "the absolute @xmath4-band magnitude , @xmath8 , of each selected galaxy as an isolated host is calculated from @xmath6 by properly taking into account both of the @xmath9-correction @xcite and the luminosity evolution correction @xcite .    for each host with @xmath10",
    ", we look for its nearest neighbor galaxy in the redshift range of @xmath11 and determine the difference between the heliocentric velocities of the host and its nearest neighbor along the line of sight , @xmath12 , as well as the projected separation distance between them in the projected plane of the sky , @xmath13 .",
    "as done in @xcite , the host galaxies are identified as the isolated ones if their nearest neighbors satisfy two conditions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the projected virial radii of the host galaxy and its nearest neighbor , respectively , where the projected virial radius is defined as the projected radius which encloses the mean mass density as high as @xmath18 times the critical density of the universe .    for an isolated host galaxy with absolute @xmath4-band magnitude of @xmath8 ,",
    "the candidates of its satellites satisfy the following two conditions : first , the absolute @xmath4-band magnitude is larger than @xmath19 .",
    "second , the difference in the radial velocity between a satellite candidate and its host , @xmath20 , is smaller than the escape velocity of a satellite , @xmath21 . taking into account the dependence of the escape velocity of a satellite on the mass of its host galaxy and assuming that the constant mass - to - light ratio of an elliptical host galaxy is twice that of an spiral galaxy , @xcite derived an equation of @xmath22 where the amplitude @xmath23 has the value of @xmath24km / s and @xmath25km / s for the elliptical and the spiral galaxies , respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath23 were empirically determined from the work of @xcite who studied the frequency distribution of the differences in the radial velocities between the sdss galaxy pairs . in the works of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the elliptical and spiral galaxies were classified according to the morphology segregator that had been developed by @xcite based on the gradients of the galaxy colors .",
    "the true satellites of an isolated host galaxy are identified among the candidates as the ones whose separation distances from the isolated host , @xmath26 , in the projected plane of sky are less than some threshold , @xmath27 , given as @xcite @xmath28 for the detailed description of how to identify the isolated galactic systems , the readers are referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a total of @xmath29 sdss galaxies are selected as the isolated hosts having one or more satellites .",
    "the ranges of the absolute @xmath4-band magnitudes , the projected virial radius and the satellite number ( @xmath30 ) of the selected hosts are found to be @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . figure [ fig : mag ] plots the absolute @xmath4-band magnitudes of the isolated host galaxies ( black dots ) and their satellites ( grey dots ) from the selected sample of the sdss dr7 as a function of redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : circle ] illustrates the configuration of the satellites ( grey dots ) identified around the isolated host galaxies ( black cross ) , whose declination ( dec ) , right ascension ( ra ) and redshifts are in the ranges of @xmath34dec@xmath35 , @xmath36ra@xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the radius of the circle around each isolated host galaxy corresponds to the threshold separation distance , @xmath27 , in equation ( [ eqn : satbound ] ) .",
    "the apparent overlapping among the neighbouring circles around the host galaxies are merely due to the projection effect . for the visibility ,",
    "only those galactic systems having five or more satellites are shown in figures [ fig : mag]-[fig : circle ] .    to determine the principal axes of the local velocity shears at the positions of the selected host galaxies , we utilize the density and velocity fields reconstructed by @xcite from the galaxy group catalog based on the sdss dr7 @xcite . @xcite",
    "estimated the masses of the galaxy groups according to the prescriptions of @xcite which is based on the ranking of the stellar masses of the galaxies and a varying mass - to - light ratio model . for a detailed description of the halo - mass estimator ,",
    "see @xcite . selecting only those galaxy groups with @xmath39 located in the `` survey volume '' which spans the redshift range of @xmath40 , and taking into account the redshift distortion effect on the positions of the selected galaxy groups",
    ", @xcite reconstructed the density field @xmath41 with the help of the halo tracing algorithm .",
    "the reconstructed density field @xmath41 was defined on the @xmath42 cubic cells comprising the survey volume , where each cell has a linear size of @xmath43mpc and its position @xmath44 is measured in the equatorial coordinate systems    transforming the density field @xmath41 into the fourier space and assuming that the peculiar velocity field @xmath45 is curl free and thus related to the density field as @xmath46 , @xcite determined the fourier amplitudes of the filtered peculiar velocity field @xmath47 from those of the density field @xmath48 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the fourier - space wave vector with magnitude of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the fourier - space gaussian window function with a filtering radius of @xmath53 .",
    "the peculiar velocity field smoothed on the scale of @xmath53 was reconstructed via the inverse fourier transformation of @xmath54 .",
    "as stated in @xcite , the accuracy of the reconstructed density and peculiar velocity fields depends on the filtering scale . on small scales",
    "@xmath55 , the reconstructed fields are expected to be inaccurate due to the limited spatial resolution . on large scales",
    ", the reconstruction would also fail to yield a good approximation due to the presence of the boundary effect .",
    "@xcite claimed that when @xmath56mpc , the reconstruction worked well in the low - redshift inner cells ( close to the center ) that occupy the @xmath57 of the survey volume .",
    "the portion of the survey volume where the density field is reconstructed with high accuracy would diminish as the filtering scale @xmath53 increases .",
    "since we will consider larger scales of @xmath58mpc to explore the shear - satellite alignments in section [ sec : analysis ] , we have to restrict our analysis to the innermost regions of the survey volume to secure the reliability of the reconstructed velocity shear fields .",
    "we find that the isolated galactic systems in our sample can be covered by the innermost subvolume of @xmath59mpc@xmath60 consisting of @xmath61 cells whose equatorial positions , @xmath62 , range as @xmath63 . here",
    ", the innermost subvolume represents the regions close to the center of the survey volume corresponds to the redshift range of @xmath64 .",
    "the velocity shear field defined @xmath65 @xcite has been linearly reconstructed on this subvolume @xcite . here",
    "we calculate the fourier amplitudes of the velocity shear field , @xmath66 , directly from the fourier amplitudes of the density field @xmath48 as @xmath67 and finally obtain the velocity shear field , @xmath68 , smoothed on the scale of @xmath53 via the inverse fourier transformation .",
    "note that the _ linearly reconstructed _ velocity shear field is essentially the same ( apart from the overall amplitude ) as the tidal shear field @xmath69 defined as the second derivative of the gravitational potential as @xmath70 since the gravitational potential @xmath71 is related to the density field as @xmath72 .",
    "in other words , the directions of the principal axes of @xmath73 are the same as those of @xmath69 . on small scales",
    "where the real velocity field should no longer be assumed to be curl free , the linearly reconstructed velocity field would fail to approximate well the real velocity field .",
    "however , @xcite showed by @xmath0-body simulations that the vorticity quickly vanishes as the filtering scale increases and that the directions of the principal axes of the real velocity shear field do not change sensitively with the smoothing scales over a wide range , which implied that the linearly reconstructed velocity shear field should be a good approximation to the real velocity field on large scales .",
    "using information on the redshifts and equatorial coordinates of the host and its satellites in each of the isolated galactic systems , we determine the three dimensional ( comoving ) positions , @xmath74 , of the satellites relative to the host . at the cell to which the position of each isolated host belongs , we diagonalize the velocity shear tensor @xmath75 through the similarity transformation to evaluate its three eigenvalues ( say , @xmath76 in a decreasing order ) and determine the corresponding three eigenvectors ( say , @xmath77 ) as the major , intermediate and minor principal axes of the velocity shear tensor .    to see how the directions of the principal axes of the local velocity shears estimated at the positions of the host galaxies change with the filtering scale",
    ", we evaluate the average of the cross - correlations between the principal axes of the local velocity shears smoothed on two different filtering scales , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , as @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ fig : cross ] plots the cross - correlations as a function of the difference , @xmath82 , with @xmath78 set at @xmath83mpc .",
    "as can be seen , the cross - correlations decrease quite slowly as @xmath84 increases . especially the minor principal axes exhibit the slowest decrement among the three axes , showing less than @xmath85 change as @xmath84 varies over a wide range from @xmath83mpc to @xmath86mpc .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : data ] , this result agrees well with the numerical finding of @xcite who demonstrated by @xmath0-body simulations that the orientations of the principal axes of the velocity shear field are quite robust against the changes of the filtering scale .",
    "it is , however , worth recalling that @xcite utilized the real velocity shear field while here we deals with the linearly reconstructed one .    given that the positions of the galaxies as well as the directions of the principal axes of the velocity shear tensors determined in the redshift space are likely to suffer from systematic errors , we examine whether or not the distributions of @xmath74 and @xmath87 in each galactic system are isotropic relative to the line - of - sight direction to its host galaxy , say , @xmath88 .",
    "first , we measure the alignment between the relative positions of the satellites @xmath74 and the unit vector in the line of sight direction as @xmath89 and take the average over all of the selected galactic systems .",
    "if there were no systematic errors in the measurement of the positions of the satellites in the line - of - sight directions , the average value of @xmath90 would be close to @xmath91 .",
    "however , the actual average value of @xmath90 has turned out to be @xmath92 which significantly exceeds the value of @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , we compute the average of the alignments between @xmath87 and @xmath88 as @xmath93 for @xmath81 .",
    "the average values are found to be @xmath94 , when the filtering scale for the velocity shear field is set at @xmath95mpc .",
    "these results reveal that the principal axes of the local velocity shears measured at the positions of the host galaxies are not isotropically oriented relative to the line - of - sight directions but the minor ones appear to be preferentially aligned with @xmath88 . therefore ,",
    "if the alignments between @xmath74 and @xmath96 are measured in the three dimensional redshift space , the result would be contaminated by the presence of a spurious signal induced by the _ extrinsic _ alignments of both of @xmath74 and @xmath96 with the line of sight directions .    to eliminate a spurious signal and detect a true signal of the _ intrinsic _ alignments between the principal axes of the velocity shear field and the positions of the satellites , we project them onto the plane of sky , as done in @xcite . from here on ,",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath98 represent the two dimensional satellite positions and the principal axes of the local velocity shear tensors projected onto the plane of sky perpendicular to @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "we define the _ alignment angle _",
    ", @xmath99 , of each selected system as the mean value of the angles between the projected positions of the satellites relative to their host and the projected @xmath100-th principal axes of the local velocity shear tensor : @xmath101 where @xmath30 is the number of the satellites belonging to a given system , @xmath102 is the two dimensional position of the @xmath103-th satellite .",
    "if the satellites were isotropically distributed with respect to the @xmath100-th principal axes of the velocity shear field , then @xmath99 would be close to @xmath104 for @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath71 is lower ( higher ) than @xmath104 , then it should imply a signal of alignment ( anti - alignment ) .",
    "figure [ fig : conf ] illustrates how the alignment angle is measured between the projected position of a satellite and the projected minor principal axis of a local velocity shear tensor at the location of a host galaxy in the plane of the sky .",
    "we determine the alignment angle @xmath99 for each galactic system and take the ensemble average of @xmath99 over all galactic systems for four different cases of the filtering scale : @xmath105mpc , the results of which are shown table [ tab : rf ] .",
    "the error @xmath106 represents the standard deviation in the measurement of @xmath107 calculated as @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the number of the selected galactic systems .",
    "as can be seen , the projected positions of the satellites of the isolated galactic systems are aligned with the projected minor principal axes and anti - aligned with the projected major principal axes of the local velocity shears .",
    "although the strength of the alignment signal seems to decrease as @xmath53 increases , the alignment signal does not disappear even when the filtering scales reaches up to @xmath110mpc . at this stage ,",
    "an intriguing question that arises is at what filtering scale the alignment signal would disappear . the current analysis , however",
    ", can not provide an answer to this question since we can not consider an arbitrarily large filtering scale because of the fact that the reconstructed velocity shear field becomes more and more inaccurate as @xmath53 increases @xcite .",
    "the results presented in section [ sec : analysis ] provides a clear observational evidence that the spatial locations of the galactic satellites around the isolated hosts are preferentially aligned with the minor principal axes of the local velocity shear field .",
    "given that the projection procedure must have played a role in weakening the alignment signal , it is expected that the true alignment tendency must be stronger than detected in the current analysis .",
    "now , we would like to investigate if and how the alignment strength depends on the properties of the galactic systems .",
    "let us first see how the alignment angles depend on the distances between the satellites and the hosts .",
    "for each selected galactic system , we divide the satellites into two subsamples according to their projected distances @xmath26 from their hosts measured in the plane of the sky .",
    "one subsample consists of those satellites with @xmath111 while the other has the satellites with @xmath112 , where @xmath16 denotes the projected virial radius of their host .",
    "the alignment angles , @xmath113 , of each system are measured twice by using the two subsamples separately .",
    "the averages of them over all of the selected galactic systems are also separately taken .",
    "the first and second rows of table [ tab : satellite ] show the averages of the alignment angles , @xmath114 , for the two cases that the values of @xmath113 of each galactic system are measured by using only those satellites whose separation distances @xmath26 from their host are smaller and larger than the projected virial radius , @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the filtering scale of the velocity shear field is set at @xmath95mpc from here on .",
    "although separating the satellites into the two subsamples resulted in larger errors , one can still see a clear alignment tendency for the case of the satellites with @xmath115 .",
    "whereas , the satellites with @xmath116 appear to be almost isotropically distributed with respect to the principal axes of the local velocity field .",
    "this result implies that the alignment tendency between the spatial locations of the satellites and the minor principal axes of the local velocity shear field diminishes as the satellites enter the virial radii of their hosts where the non - linear effect is expected to be dominant .",
    "next , we investigate how the alignment signal depends on the absolute @xmath4-band magnitudes of the satellites . separating the brighter satellites of each galactic system with @xmath117 from the fainter ones with @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the median value of the absolute @xmath4-band magnitudes of the satellites , the values of @xmath120 of each galactic system are measured twice by using the two subsamples separately .",
    "the third and fourth rows of table [ tab : satellite ] shows @xmath114 for the two cases that the values of @xmath113 of each galactic system are measured by using the brighter and fainter satellites , respectively . although the relatively large errors prevent us from finding a statistically significant signal , the result hints at how the alignment strength depends on @xmath6 : the brighter galaxies are more strongly aligned with the minor principal axes of the local velocity shear tensors than the fainter counterparts , which is in fact consistent with the previous numerical results ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) that the more massive satellites tend to be more preferentially aligned with the minor principal axes of the local velocity shear field .",
    "we also investigate whether or not the alignment strength depends on the morphology of the satellites . using the morphology segregator algorithm suggested by @xcite , we classify the satellites of each galactic system into the ellipticals and the spirals .",
    "then , the alignment angles of each galactic system are measured twice by using separately the elliptical and the spiral satellites , the result of which is displayed in the fifth and sixth rows of table [ tab : satellite ] . as can be seen ,",
    "although the errors are large , the alignment tendency can be found for the case of the spiral satellites but no alignment signal for the case of the elliptical satellites .",
    "our interpretation of the results shown in table [ tab : satellite ] is that the strength of the alignment between the relative positions of the galactic satellites and the minor principal axes of the velocity shear field depends on the formation and accretion epochs of the galactic satellites .",
    "the satellites have accreted onto the hosts in the directions aligned with the minor principal axes of the linear velocity shear field .",
    "after they become bound to the host system , the nonlinear modifications gradually weeken the tendency of the alignments between their positions and the minor principal axes of the velocity shears .",
    "the earlier the satellites have formed and accreted onto their hosts , the less strong the alignments of their locations with the minor principal axes of the velocity shear fields are . comparing this result of our analysis with those from the previous works",
    "@xcite which found that the elliptical galaxies are more strongly aligned with the elongated axes of the host galaxies , we suspect that the alignments between the locations of the satellites and the shapes of their hosts should be modulated by the nonlinear interaction between the satellites and the hosts after the accretion of the satellites .",
    "now , we would like to see if and how the alignment strength depends on the properties of the host galaxies as well as the surrounding environment .",
    "we first investigate dependence of the alignment tendency on the host size .",
    "the median value of the projected virial radii of the selected isolated hosts is found to be @xmath121mpc .",
    "determining the alignment angle @xmath113 of each galactic system , we calculate the ensemble average , @xmath114 over those systems whose hosts have @xmath16 larger than the median value .",
    "we repeat the same but only over those with @xmath16 equal to or less than the median value .",
    "the first and second rows of table [ tab : host ] show the result , indicating that the alignment strength is insensitive to the sizes of the host galaxies .",
    "we also examine the dependence of the shear - satellite alignments on the absolute @xmath4-band magnitudes of the hosts .",
    "the median value of the absolute @xmath4-band magnitudes of the selected isolated hosts is found to be @xmath122 .",
    "we determine @xmath114 separately over those systems whose hosts have @xmath123 and over @xmath124 .",
    "the results shown in the third and fourth rows of table [ tab : host ] indicate a trend of almost independence of the shear - satellite alignment strength on the absolute @xmath4-band magnitudes of the host galaxies .    to see if the strength of the shear - satellite alignment depends on the morphology of the hosts , we calculate @xmath114 separately over those systems with spiral hosts and repeat the same calculation but over those whose hosts are ellpiticals ,",
    "the results of which are shown in the fifth and sixth rows of table [ tab : host ] . as can be seen",
    ", there is a tendency that the galactic satellites belonging to the spiral hosts show higher strength of the alignments with the minor principal axes of the velocity shear tensors .",
    "this tendency is consistent with the picture that the non - linear effect breaks the shear - satellite alignments after the formation and accretion of the satellites since the elliptical hosts are believed to have formed earlier and thus their satellites were more severely affected by the nonlinear effect .    using the web - classification scheme suggested by @xcite",
    ", we determine in which web environment each galactic system reside and find that most of the systems are located either in the filament where @xmath125 and @xmath126 or in the sheet where @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here why we used the web - classification scheme proposed by @xcite rather than that of @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two schemes is that the web classification of @xcite adopted the positive threshold of @xmath129 while in the analysis of @xcite the threshold value was set at zero @xmath130 . in the currently analysis , we have used the _ linearly reconstructed _",
    "velocity shear field which is same as the tidal shear field and thus adopt the zero threshold value of @xmath130 .",
    "in fact , even in @xcite this zero threshold value was used to classify the web environment for the investigation of the universality of the velocity shear effect .    among the @xmath29",
    "selected galactic systems , a total of @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) systems are found to be in the filament ( sheet ) .",
    "the rest of the selected systems are found to reside either in the knot or in the void . after calculating @xmath113 of each galactic system , we take its ensemble average over only those systems located in the filament .",
    "we repeat the same but over those systems located in the sheet .",
    "we do not consider the galactic systems residing in the void or in the knot since the evaluation of @xmath114 would suffer from small number statistics for those cases .",
    "the seventh and eighth rows of table [ tab : host ] show how the ensemble averages of the alignment angles are different between the two cases that the galactic systems are embedded in the sheet and in the filament environments . as can be seen",
    ", there is almost no difference between the two cases , which is consistent with the numerical prediction of @xcite based on a high - resolution @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "our work has been done in the light of two recent literatures .",
    "the first one is @xcite which claimed with the help of a @xmath0-body experiment that the local velocity shear field dictates the anisotropic infalls of the satellites onto their hosts .",
    "the second one is @xcite which found an observational evidence for the anti - alignments of the locations of the cluster galaxies with the major principal axes of the local velocity shears by analyzing the extended virgo cluster catalog @xcite .    using a sample of the isolated galactic systems in the redshift range of @xmath3 from the sdss dr7 and the velocity shear field linearly reconstructed in the local volume where the isolated galactic systems are located ,",
    "we have analysed the spatial distributions of the galactic satellites in the principal frame of the local velocity shear tensor and found a clear signal of the alignment between the locations of the galactic satellites and the minor principal axes of the velocity shear field projected onto the plane of sky .",
    "the projection procedure has been conducted to avoid any false alignment signal produced by systematic errors in the measurements of the positions of the galactic satellites as well as the principal axes of the velocity shear field in the redshift space .",
    "the satellite - shear alignment tendency has been shown to be stable against the changes of the filtering scale .",
    "investigating the dependence of the alignment tendency on the properties of the satellites , we have found stronger alignment signals for the cases that the galactic satellites are spirals , more luminous , located at distances larger than the projected virial radii of their hosts and belonging to the spiral hosts .",
    "given these results , we have suggested that the strength of the satellite - shear alignment should depend most sensitively on the formation and accretion epochs of the galactic satellites .",
    "the earlier the satellites formed and accreted onto their host galaxies , the less strong the satellite - shear alignments are since the nonlinear modification after the formation and accretion of the satellites would play a role in diminishing the satellite - shear alignment tendency .",
    "given the results of the previous works ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which found that the preferential alignments with the elongated axes of the host galaxies were exhibited only by the elliptical satellites but not by the spiral counterparts , we speculate that the alignments of the locations of the satellites with the elongated axes of the hosts should be modulated dominantly by the non - linear effect .    we have also noted a trend that the strength of the satellite - shear alignment does not vary with the sizes and luminosities of the host galaxies and the web environment , which is in line with the numerical prediction of @xcite based on a @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "however , due to the very low statistical significance , the observed signals from our analysis can not not provide a convincing direct evidence for the numerical claim of @xcite and thus it is still inconclusive whether or not the velocity shear has a truly universal effect on the satellite infall motions .",
    "it would require a larger dataset to detect a signal with high statistical significance .",
    "in addition , to confirm the universality of the velocity shear effect on the satellite infall motions , the improvement of the analysis should be made in the following two directions .",
    "first , it will be essential to develop an algorithm for the reconstruction of the nonlinear velocity shear field .",
    "although the linearly reconstructed velocity shear field is believed to be a good approximation to the real one on large scales @xcite , this linear approximation would not be valid on small scales where the nonlinear effect becomes significant and the velocity field develops vorticity .",
    "second , as in the numerical work of @xcite , it will be necessary to determine the true infall directions of the satellites from observations .",
    "although the direction of the spatial position of a satellite and that of its infall motion are expected to be strongly aligned with each other , they should not be equal .",
