    "<S> furthermore @xmath0 yukawa @xcite coupling unification at @xmath6 arises in supersymmetric so(10 ) , in contrast to its non - supersymmetric counterpart . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we considered a supersymmetric so(10 ) model with non - universal soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) gaugino masses at @xmath6 , arising from a non - singlet f - component of the field which breaks supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed , in particular , a gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario @xcite with the following relation at @xmath6 among the masses of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote the gaugino masses of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . in order to obtain the correct sign for the desired contribution to @xmath12 , we set @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    employing the boundary condition from eq.([gaugino10 ] ) , one can define the mssm gaugino masses at @xmath17 in terms of the mass parameter @xmath18 : @xmath19 in order to quantify yukawa coupling unification , we define the quantity @xmath20 as , @xmath21    we have performed random scans for the following parameter range : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the universal ssb mass for mssm sfermions , @xmath24 is the universal ssb mass term for up and down mssm higgs masses , @xmath25 is the ssb gaugino mass parameter , @xmath26 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two mssm higgs doublets , @xmath27 is the universal ssb trilinear scalar interaction ( with corresponding yukawa coupling factored out ) . </S>",

    "<S> we implement the following random scanning procedure : a uniform and logarithmic distribution of random points is first generated in the parameter space given in eq.([parameterrange ] ) . a gaussian distribution of points is then generated around each point in the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we successively apply the following experimental constraints on the data that we acquire from this interface :    [ cols=\">,<,^ \" , ]     in figure [ fig2 ] the color coding is the same as in figure [ fig : r - mh ] . in addition </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath35 panel shows that @xmath36-@xmath37-@xmath38 yukawa unification in our scenario predicts masses for the gluino and the first two family squarks which lie around 4 tev or so , which can be observed in the future at lhc .    in the present framework , </S>",
    "<S> the wmap constraint on the relic dark matter abundance is only satisfied by the neutralino - stau coannihilation scenario where the neutralino and stau masses are degenerate to a good approximation ( see brown points ) . from the plot in @xmath39 plane of figure [ fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that demanding @xmath40 or better yukawa unification yields the following constraint on the lsp neutralino mass , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be seen whether alternative coannihilation scenarios may emerge after a more through analysis .    in table </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ] we present three benchmark points with acceptable degree of yukawa unification and sm - like higgs mass close to 125 gev ( recall the @xmath42 2 gev theoretical uncertainty in estimating this mass ) . </S>",

    "<S> point 1 represent solutions that yield almost perfect yukawa unification ( of around @xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> point 2 depicts stau coannihilation in addition to a 124 gev higgs and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> point 3 shows that perfectly respectable @xmath0 yukawa unification can be achieved with nearly degenerate ( @xmath45 ) sfermion and higgs scalar masses at @xmath46 . </S>"
