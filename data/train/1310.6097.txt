    "the role of electron correlations on the photophysics of @xmath2-conjugated systems has been of continuing interest .",
    "existing research has largely focused on the effect of electron correlations on one - photon allowed optical states .",
    "these states can be described nearly quantitatively upon including the configuration interaction ( ci ) between many - electron configurations that are singly excited from the mean - field ground state .",
    "we will refer to these configurations as one electron - one hole ( 1e-1h ) excitations hereafter .",
    "such single ci ( hereafter sci ) studies @xcite and equivalent approaches ( time - dependent density functional theory , bethe - salpeter equation ) have been widely employed to understand one - photon excitations .",
    "the dominant effect of the sci in finite molecules is to remove the degeneracies between 1e-1h excitations that are obtained within the one - electron or mean - field theories @xcite .",
    "the effect on extended systems is similar , with electron - hole interactions leading to exciton states separated from a continuum band @xcite .",
    "there exists a wide body of experimental literature that supports these theoretical concepts in @xmath2-conjugated systems , including in extended carbon nanostructures @xcite .    in systems with",
    "inversion symmetry spin - singlet excited states accessible by one- and two - photon excitations from the singlet ground state are distinct .",
    "the consequences of electron correlations on the one - photon forbidden but two - photon allowed states in correlated - electron systems are often more intricate .",
    "two - photon states , even at the lowest energies , can have significant contributions from two electron - two hole ( 2e-2h ) excitations , which have ci with both the correlated ground state and up to four electron - four hole ( 4e-4h ) excitations , as was shown @xcite within the pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) @xmath2-electron hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the higher order ci can lower the energy of the two - photon states significantly relative to the one - photon states .",
    "thus at the mean - field or sci levels of approximation , the lowest excited state in linear polyenes is the odd - parity optical 1@xmath3b@xmath4 state , with the lowest even parity 2@xmath3a@xmath5 state occurring above it ( the superscript @xmath6 indicates singlet spin state and the `` plus '' and `` minus '' superscripts refer to charge - conjugation symmetry , hereafter ccs ) .",
    "this is the `` normal '' excited state ordering . because of the higher order ci , however , in long polyenes @xcite as well as in the polydiacetylenes @xcite , the two - photon 2@xmath3a@xmath7 occurs _ below _",
    ". we will refer to this latter ordering as `` reversed '' excited state ordering .",
    "the energy of the lowest two - photon states , relative to that of the lowest one - photon optical state , as well as the extent of 2e-2h character of the lowest two - photon states , are then semiquantitative _ `` measures '' _ of electron correlation effects .    reversed excited state ordering",
    "is best understood within valence bond ( vb ) concepts , within which the ground state as well as the lowest spin - singlet even parity two - photon states are predominantly covalent @xcite .",
    "the dipole selection rule limits optical excitations from the even parity covalent ground state to odd parity ionic states , which are necessarily higher in energy than covalent states . within vb theory",
    "it is also possible to explain naturally the quantum - entangled two - triplet character of the 2@xmath3a@xmath7 in polyenes , whose energy is almost exactly twice the energy of the lowest spin triplet 1@xmath8b@xmath9 ( we suppress the charge - conjugation symmetries for triplets as we do not calculate triplet absorption spectra in this work ) .",
    "actually , in long polyenes , several of the low - lying @xmath3a@xmath7 states are quantum superpositions of low - lying triplets , which are themselves also covalent within the vb language @xcite .",
    "indeed , within the hubbard model description of linear chains with very large onsite coulomb interactions , the lowest spin - triplet and singlets are both spin excitations , while the optical state is necessarily a charge - excitation @xcite .",
    "the extent to which higher energy two - photon states are of `` two - triplet '' character , and the separation between them in energy space , are therefore additional measures of electron correlation effects : the smaller the separation between spin singlet states with two - triplet character , the stronger is the electron correlation effect .",
    "although the original understanding of reversed excited state ordering came from ppp - model calculations , over the years there have been steady efforts to develop more sophisticated correlated _ ab initio _ approaches to reversed excited state ordering in polyenes . quantum chemical approaches that reproduce",
    "the ppp results for polyenes include the complete active space second order perturbation theory ( caspt2 ) and third - order coupled cluster theory @xcite , and the extended algebraic diagrammatic construction ( adc(2)-x ) method @xcite .",
    "other methods that have been applied are density functional theory - based multiple reference configuration interaction ( dft - mrci ) @xcite , and the om2-mrci @xcite .",
    "all of these approaches have confirmed the 2e-2h character of the lowest two - photon states in the polyenes , and except for the absence of ccs symmetry within the _ ab initio _ theories , no significant difference has been found between the results obtained by methods which incorporate a high degree of correlations @xcite . on the other hand , because of the dominant double - excitation character of the two - photon states , the number of many - electron configurations that need to be retained in the calculations increases rapidly with system size , and calculations of polyenes within the _ ab initio _ approaches are limited to relatively small system sizes ( between 8 to 12 carbon atoms usually ) .",
    "the rapid increase in the number of multiply excited configurations with system size has precluded high order ci studies for large molecules starting from _ ab initio _ approaches .",
    "accurate studies of two - photon states and excited state ordering in large @xmath2-conjugated systems have therefore been done mostly within the semiempirical ppp @xmath2-electron - only model hamiltonian .",
    "density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations have been performed for long chain systems @xcite within the ppp hamiltonian .",
    "in particular was able to obtain several close - lying @xmath3a@xmath7 states below the 1@xmath3b@xmath4 in the long chain limit of polydiacetylenes , that were at nearly twice the energies of the lowest triplets .",
    "the results for the two - photon states in the long chain limit here are in excellent agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "normal , as opposed to reversed excited state ordering occurs in @xmath2-conjugated polymers with large unit cells containing phenyl groups is found within ppp calculations , and the mechanism of this is also well understood @xcite .",
    "the optical 1@xmath3b@xmath4 state has contributions from frenkel intraunit 1e-1h excitations as well as interunit charge - transfer excitations , with the charge - transfer contribution dominating in linear polyenes @xcite .",
    "the 2@xmath3a@xmath7 is reached from the 1@xmath3b@xmath4 , by a second interunit charge - transfer in the reverse direction @xcite . as the charge - transfer contribution to the 1@xmath3b@xmath4 decreases and the frenkel contribution increases ,",
    "the relative energy of the 2@xmath3a@xmath7 is enhanced and normal excited state ordering is recovered @xcite .",
    "the study of excited state ordering in the low energy region of 1d carbon - based systems can be taken to be complete .",
    "in contrast to the 1d systems , theoretical and experimental studies of two - photon states and excited state ordering in two - dimensional ( 2d ) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are in their early stages .",
    "we have very recently presented joint theory - experiment results of investigations for a few select pah molecules @xcite .",
    "the molecules investigated theoretically in all cases had @xmath0 point group symmetry .",
    "the reason for choosing this particular set was because the two molecules investigated experimentally , coronene ( c@xmath10h@xmath11 ) , which is commercially available , and hexa - peri - hexabenzocoronene ( c@xmath12h@xmath13 , hereafter hbc ) , which was synthesized by our experimental colleagues , both had @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "correlation effects in these @xmath0 pah molecules were shown to be significant , and reversed excited state ordering was demonstrated experimentally and theoretically in both coronene and hbc .",
    "as per our measures discussed above , correlation effects in pahs are stronger than in the @xmath2-conjugated polymers with phenyl groups , in spite of the larger one - electron bandwidths of the former . at the same time , they are weaker in pahs than in linear polyenes , since in pahs the lowest two - photon states were found from our calculations to be predominantly ( though not entirely ) 1e-1h in character , in contrast to the 2@xmath3a@xmath7 in the polyenes , in which the 2e-2h contributions dominate over the 1e-1h contributions @xcite . the weaker correlation effect in pahs , relative to polyenes , is expected because of the larger one - electron bandwidth of pahs in which each carbon ( c ) atom has three as opposed to two neighboring c - atoms",
    "we have subsequently performed high order ci calculations of higher energy one- versus two - photon singlet excited states , and spin triplet states of these @xmath0 pah molecules to get a more complete picture .",
    "we have also implemented the same calculations for a different pah molecule possessing @xmath1 point group symmetry , ovalene ( c@xmath14h@xmath13 ) , for comparison ( see fig .",
    "[ molecules ] ) .",
    "in addition to calculating energies we have also performed detailed wavefunction analyses .",
    "our computational results lead to a surprising conclusion , viz .",
    ", as measured against our criteria above , _ the extent of electron correlation effects in pahs is geometry - dependent ! _ correlation effects are considerably stronger in @xmath1 ovalene than in the @xmath0 pah molecules with comparable or even slightly larger sizes .",
    "a `` hierarchy '' of correlation effects ( polyenes @xmath15 @xmath1 pahs @xmath15 @xmath0 pahs ) thus emerges , which has no obvious explanation .",
    "we emphasize that the effect we demonstrate in this work is separate from that of the edges which drives the difference between graphene nanoribbons with zigzag versus armchair edges @xcite , as two of the three @xmath0 pah molecules we study , as well as ovalene with @xmath1 symmetry , have zigzag edges .",
    "difference is also known to exist between finite triangular versus hexagonal graphene fragments with zigzag edges @xcite . in the former",
    "there always occur degenerate one - electron levels at the chemical potential , as a consequence of which the ground state wavefunction of the neutral molecule is a superposition of degenerate configurations .",
    "in contrast , there occurs a gap in the one - electron levels of small hexagonal fragments , and the closed shell ground state wavefunction is nondegenerate . in the present case , the overall ground state wavefunction is nondegenerate in all cases , and the difference we find",
    "can not be understood within one - electron theory .",

    "for the correlated - electron calculations reported below we choose standard @xmath27 ev @xcite , and obtain @xmath26 from the parameterization @xcite , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the distance in @xmath30 between carbon atoms @xmath19 and @xmath23 and @xmath31 is an effective dielectric constant .",

    "interestingly , the quantum number of the apparent t@xmath123t@xmath107 @xmath3a@xmath7 state decreases from 5 in coronene and hbc to 3 in circumcoronene , suggesting that in still larger @xmath0 pahs the 2@xmath3a@xmath111 may be the t@xmath123t@xmath107 state .",
    "this size dependence is consistent with the size - dependent behavior of @xmath3a@xmath7 states noted previously in polyenes , where with increasing size the energy of the 2@xmath3a@xmath7 relative to that of the 1@xmath3b@xmath4 decreases , and also more and more @xmath3a@xmath7 states appear below the 1@xmath3b@xmath4 .",

    "there is an apparent contradiction here when one compares the one- and two - photon spectra in fig .  2 , where the 2@xmath3a@xmath7 occurs below the allowed one - photon state in coronene but slightly above the one - photon state in ovalene",

    "the apparent t@xmath124t@xmath108 is again a @xmath3a@xmath7 state with high quantum number , which then indicates that correlation effects are weaker in ovalene than in polyenes .",

    "occur several additional @xmath3a@xmath7 states which are difficult to characterize in simple terms .",

    "the occurrence of the t@xmath124t@xmath108 states at very high energies in the pahs , along with the mixed character of the @xmath3a@xmath111 states below this state show that while electron correlations still split the 2e-2h excited states into triplet - triplet and singlet - singlet , their energetic locations are quite different from those in polyenes .",
    "in summary , we have performed accurate high order ci calculations of spin - singlet one- and two - photon excited states , and spin - triplet states for a number of 2d pah molecules that indicate the strong role of electron correlations in these systems .",
    "the predicted excited state ordering in all cases is significantly different from the predictions of one - electron theory . in the past ,",
    "theoretical work on 1d molecules , oligomers and polymers have been accompanied by extensive experimental work @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that these first results for the pah molecules will similarly motivate spectroscopist to study their singlet and triplet energy spectra . as pointed out in our earlier work on the @xmath0 pah molecules @xcite , the relative ordering of one- versus two - photon states at the lowest energies suggests that correlation effects might be important even in the thermodynamic limit of graphene and gives us motivation to pursue theoretical and experimental investigation of even larger graphene fragments @xcite .",
    "we defined two different semiquantitative measures of correlation effects here , and from both counts the @xmath1 molecule ovalene is significantly more strongly correlated than the three @xmath0 pah molecules we investigated .",
    "it is tempting to ascribe the difference to ovalene being the `` most quasi-1d '' , but the overall one - electron bandwidths of the molecules are quite comparable , ranging from 5.35@xmath159 in coronene to 5.68@xmath159 in circumcoronene , increasing slowly with system size . indeed ,",
    "larger correlation effect in ovalene with 32 c - atoms than in circumcoronene with 54 c - atoms is quite unexpected , given the very rapid increase in the number of covalent vb diagrams with size .",
    "one obvious difference between the two classes is the degeneracies of the one - electron frontier mos in the @xmath0 molecules versus their nondegeneracy in @xmath1 .",
    "the characters of the frontier mos in ovalene are however very different from that in the polyenes , in that the transitions h @xmath100 l@xmath1031 and h@xmath1021 @xmath100 l , forbidden in the polyenes , are allowed in ovalene .",
    "thus the nondegeneracy in ovalene results from weak symmetry breaking relative to the @xmath0 pahs , and does not result in perfect alternation of one - electron levels with opposite symmetries , as occurs in polyenes .",
    "our calculated results here suggest much larger covalent character of the ground state itself in the less symmetric case .",
    "there exist a variety of many - body techniques for studying the ground state wavefunctions of large correlated - electron systems .",
