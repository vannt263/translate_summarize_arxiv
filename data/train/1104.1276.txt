    "in the last years , it was understood that entanglement does not exhaust all quantum correlations in a system .",
    "information correlations measured by entropy @xcite were placed at the forefront .",

    "the total correlations may be divided into two parts : purely classical correlations @xmath3 and purely quantum ones @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the quantum excess of correlations , @xmath5 , has been called _ discord _ @xcite .",
    "note that the quantum discord has been evaluated explicitly only for several families of two - particle states ( density matrices ) @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that discord can exist even in separable ( but mixed ) states , i.e. when quantum entanglement is identically equal to zero .",
    "an example of two - qubit separable state with nonzero discord @xmath6 was given in ref .",
    "below , in our paper , we will also discuss similar situations . as it turns out ,",
    "`` almost all quantum states have nonclassical correlations '' @xcite .",
    "thus , quantum discord is a different measure of quantum correlation than entanglement .",
    "as shown on the model of deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit ( dqc1 ) @xcite , quantum discord can lead to a speedup over classical computation even without containing much entanglement .",
    "discord can also detect the quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "moreover , recently it has been shown @xcite that in contrast to the entanglement and other thermodynamical quantities , discord makes it possible to identify the quantum phase transition points at _ finite _ temperatures @xmath7 .",
    "however , in order to utilize in practice the remarkable properties of quantum discord it is necessary to find methods to measure it experimentally .",
    "our paper concerns this important problem .",
    "for the two - qubit heisenberg systems , we found the relations between discord and the ordinary spin - spin correlation function , as well as between discord and internal energy , specific heat or magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this allows one to determine the behavior of quantum discord in various substances and investigate its properties .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model and present formulas for calculating the total , classical , and quantum correlations . here",
    "a comparison analysis is also made for those correlations and the spin - spin correlation function and for entanglement .",
    "section 3 is devoted to expressions of discord in terms of spin - spin correlation function , internal energy , specific heat , and magnetic susceptibility which are measured by standard experiments .",
    "these approaches are used on the copper nitrate compound . in this section",
    "we also present the temperature dependencies for the discord in crystals of copper(ii ) acetate complexes , which are excellent examples of dimeric materials .",
    "the results obtained are briefly summarized in section 4 .",

    "( in an antiferromagnet , the correlator @xmath37 therefore we took its absolute value . ) it is seen that at @xmath38 all correlations are maximal ( saturated)and equal to one .",
    "the correlations preserve practically the same value with a small increase of temperature .",
    "this is associated with the existence of a gap in the energy spectrum of the discussed system . with a further increase in temperature ,",
    "all kinds of correlations monotonically decrease . by this",
