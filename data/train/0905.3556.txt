    "gas transport to the centers of galaxies is still mainly an unsolved problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since most of this gas is residing in a rotating disk well beyond the center , it is essentially a problem of angular momentum transport .",
    "proposed transport mechanisms range from galactic interactions and bars , to nuclear bars and spirals , to stellar mass loss and disruption near the central black hole ( bh ) .",
    "this range in scales also closely represents a range in decreasing mass inflow rates , which in turn might be correlated with activity in the galactic nucleus ( agn ) , ranging from quasar , seyfert , liner to quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , not only is it challenging to ( observationally ) establish fueling mechanisms down to a few parsec from the center , time delays between changes in the mass inflow rate and the onset of nuclear activity further complicate linking them .",
    "it is also likely that multiple fueling mechanisms are important and act together .",
    "large - scale bars are efficient at transporting gas inward ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the presence of an inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) will cause the gas to pile up in a nuclear ring , often clearly visible due to the intense star formation ( see e.g.  figure  [ fig : images ] )",
    ". the gas might continue further inward through nested bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although dynamical constraints on a double - barred system may prohibit inflow down to the center @xcite .",
    "moreover , observational evidence of nuclear bars is scarce ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but should be interpreted with care since the prominent dust lanes in the main bar might be absent in secondary bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , nuclear spirals seem to be commonly observed , both in active and quiescent galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ranging from flocculent to grand - design nuclear spirals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "whereas the former are suggested to form by acoustic instabilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the grand - design nuclear spirals are thought to be the result of gas density waves ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) induced by the non - axisymmetric gravitational potential of a large - scale bar .",
    "the latter two might be connected in the sense that the bar - driven spiral shocks trigger the gas density waves throughout the disk @xcite , which in turn seem to be necessary for the nuclear spiral to be long - lived @xcite . the inward extended gas inflow through a nuclear spiral not only depends on the torque of the large - scale bar , but also the gas having high enough sound speed so as to loose angular momentum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the presence of a central mass concentration such as a super - massive bh to overcome a closer - in ( inner ) ilr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the deviations in the gas density due to nuclear spirals are typically only a few per cent @xcite , which makes direct imaging very difficult . instead",
    ", the obscuration due to dust thought to be associated with the gas overdensities is often employed , but when the extinction is small or the dust not well - mixed with the gas , it can lead to unclear or even missed detections of nuclear spirals . at the same time , nuclear spirals induce non - circular motions in the gas , with resulting deviations in the observed velocity field that can be a significant fraction of the underlying circular velocity . if the gas is ionized , the kinematics might be inferred from emission lines , which in general can be detected more easily and at higher spatial resolution in the optical , than can be tracers of the molecular or atomic gas such as co and hi  at radio wavelengths .",
    "moreover , while imaging typically only yields a detection of the nuclear spiral , the observed non - circular motions in combination with the gas ( over)density inferred from the simultaneously measured ( line ) fluxes might be used to derive an estimate of the gas mass in / out - flow rate .",
    "an alternative approach to get a handle on the gas flow rates is to compute the gravitational torques from the observed surface brightness using a mass - to - light ratio conversion calibrated against ( circular ) velocity measurements @xcite , or against stellar population models fitted to color measurements @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "various assumptions are made , most importantly that stellar light is a clean ( once corrected for dust obscuration ) and direct ( mass follows light ) tracer of the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "even so , this approach shows that gravitational torques due to non - axisymmetric structures are very efficient at transporting gas inward while overcoming dynamical barriers such as the corotation resonance .",
    "however , when the resulting predicted mass inflow rates as functions of radius are compared with the non - circular motions in the observed gas velocity fields the correlation between both is often not evident @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with the non - circular motions is to identify the fraction that is due to pure radial flow .",
    "gas on closed elliptic orbits not only contributes to non - circular motions ( or elliptic streaming ) in the azimuthal direction but also in the radial direction @xcite .",
    "however , since closed elliptic orbits are applicable strictly only to collisionless ( stellar ) orbits , we expect that as a result of shocks and other dissipational effects the angular momentum of the gas will change , leading to in / out - flow . while the measured non - circular motions are often taken to be directly representative of the radial flow velocities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only a fraction of them are expected to be truly radial in / out - flows .",
    "the goal of this paper is two - fold : ( i ) to show that harmonic expansion of gas velocity fields provides a clean way to detect nuclear spirals and to estimate their pitch angles ; ( ii ) to use simple perturbation models to constrain the fraction of measured non - circular motions that is due to radial flow , and to estimate the corresponding mass inflow rate . in section  [ sec : harmanalysis ]",
    "we present the harmonic analysis , and in section  [ sec : ngc1097 ] we apply it to the observed emission - line velocity field within the circumnuclear starforming ring of ngc1097 .",
    "we find that the three - arm spiral structure in the non - circular motions is consistent with a weak two - arm spiral perturbation of the gravitational potential , and use the model derived in appendix  [ app : gasorbits ] to constrain the inflow rate as function of distance from the center of ngc1097 . in section  [ sec",
    ": discussion ] we discuss the corresponding spiral distortion in the surface brightness , and possible additional non - circular motion contributions to the velocity field . finally , we link the estimated mass inflow rate to the accretion onto the central bh of ngc109 .",
    "we summarize and draw our conclusions in section  [ sec : summaryandconcl ] .",

    "we start by dividing a map into a number of elliptic annuli , each with a different semi - major axis length @xmath11 , but we assume all have the same flattening @xmath12 and share the same angle @xmath13 and center @xmath14 , so that in terms of cartesian coordinates on the map ( i.e. , on the plane of the sky ) @xmath15 if the map is aligned such that @xmath16 is pointing north and @xmath17 pointing west , then @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the common ( observational ) definition of the position angle of the major axis of the galaxy , measured from north through east .",
    "next , we extract the profiles along each of the annuli and describe them by a finite number of harmonic terms @xmath20 , @xmath21 there are various ways to obtain the set of best - fit ellipses , but given the highly non - linear nature of the optimization for the best - fit parameters , this is commonly done in a stepwise , iterative process .",
    "we follow a similar approach as described in @xcite  based on the usually adapted procedure in photometry @xcite  which we briefly summarize .    for ( early - type )",
    "galaxies , the maps of sb , @xmath8 and _ even _ higher - order velocity moments ( @xmath10 , @xmath22 ,  ) each are to first order well approximated by a function that is constant along ( concentric , equally flattened and orientated ) ellipses , and only varies as function of the semi - major axis length of these ellipses .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 and _ odd _ higher - order velocity moments ( @xmath9 , @xmath23 ,  ) each are well described by a similar function , but one that has an additional cosine variation along the ellipses . in these cases , the harmonic expansion in equation   truncates after the third - order term ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the parameters of the best - sampling ellipses for even velocity moments , can then be obtained by minimizing @xmath25 , and without @xmath26 for odd velocity moments .",
    "we first perform the minimization for a grid of ( fixed ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 values , where we might use external constraints such as the inclination @xmath27 and measured position angle @xmath19 together with an initial estimate of the center @xmath14 .",
    "next , starting from the best - fit grid pair , we optimize for all four parameters .",
    "we sample the semi - major axis lengths as @xmath28 $ ] for @xmath29 , with the initial @xmath30 depending on the spatial resolution ; for the geometric increase factor we take @xmath31 .",

    "we thus find , as concluded before by @xcite and already qualitatively inferred by @xcite that , if the gravitational potential has a perturbation of harmonic number @xmath47 , the line - of - sight velocity field contains an @xmath64 and an @xmath65 harmonic term .      how loosely or tightly wound a spiral is can be quantified via its pitch angle , @xmath66 , which , at a given radius , @xmath11 , measures the angle between the tangent of the spiral arm and a circle with radius @xmath11 in the plane of the disk . inverting the phase - shift , @xmath67 , of a spiral",

    "this implies a transition in the line - of - sight velocity field at @xmath93 , going from the @xmath94-spiral dominating outside @xmath93 to the @xmath95-spiral dominating inside @xmath93 ( see also figure  [ fig : model_pl ] ) .",
    "this is also concluded by @xcite for the collisionless case and earlier by @xcite for the less general case of a tightly wound spiral in the linear density - wave theory ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "second , @xmath90 typically varies much less with radius than the spiral phase - shifts , so that @xmath96 in equation   is relatively small . as a result",

    "still , as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , if a nuclear spiral ( or a nuclear bar ) is due to gas moving on closed elliptic orbits this results in non - circular motions , also referred to as elliptic streaming , but not necessarily in net inflow towards and/or outflow away from the center .",
    "however , unlike stars , gas is not collisionless and its orbits interact and ex - change angular momentum leading to net radial flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "henceforth , in the analytic models in appendix  [ app : gasorbits ] , we assume a weak perturbation in the gravitational potential causing gas to deviate from circular onto elliptic orbits , while taking into account its dissipative nature via radial damping .",
    "these analytic spiral models are an extension of the analytic bar models introduced by @xcite , who showed that they describe well the gas behavior seen in hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the radial damping causes the gas to lose / gain angular momentum inside / outside the corotation radius , which nicely matches the angular momentum transfer due to the torque from the bar potential in numerical simulations .",

    "a rather straightforward estimate of the net radial flow velocity , @xmath100 , can be obtained by comparing the radial velocity @xmath101 ( equation  [ eq : appsolvr ] ) of the analytic model that includes radial damping ( @xmath102 ) with the analytic model without radial damping ( @xmath103 ) . at a given radius @xmath11 ,",

    "finally , we link the mass inflow rate to the accretion onto the central bh .      an @xmath137 spiral perturbation in the gravitational potential that would explain the three - arm spiral structure in the velocity field of ngc1097 , implies an @xmath137 spiral distortion in the surface mass density and hence a two - arm spiral structure in the surface brightness .",
    "even if the latter distortion is too weak to measure directly , it might show itself through obscuration by correlated dust .",
    "indeed , structure maps of ngc1097 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "are contributions of @xmath210 or higher - order odd harmonic terms to the surface brightness possible .",
    "since the stars make up nearly all the mass in the center of ngc1097 , such a deviation from bi - symmetry , e.g. due to an eccentric nuclear disk as in m31 @xcite , or a dwarf elliptical companion , should reveal itself in the stellar kinematics .",
    "however , the central stellar kinematics of ngc1097 do not show such deviations nor any ( spiral ) structure in the non - circular motions @xcite , in support of the nuclear spiral being a perturbation in the gas .",
    "instead , @xcite propose that a difference in strength between the two principal shocks in the large - scale bar give rise to the lopsidedness .",
    "this only works in their scenario in which the shocks , and not the bar itself , create the nuclear spiral .",
    "however , while the shocks might be the trigger , it seems that density waves in the gas , driven by the bi - symmetric bar , are necessary for the nuclear spiral to be long - lived @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the typically asymmetric ( projected ) dust distribution might mimic odd harmonic terms in the surface brightness , and possible even give rise to even harmonic terms in the velocity field , as we discuss next .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 , that provide the phase - shift @xmath211 , may be `` contaminated '' by additional contributions to the non - circular motion , but in general they are not expected to result in a smooth variation of the phase - shift with radius , as seen for a spiral structure .",
    "an exception is the @xmath210 harmonic term , since the measured coefficient @xmath26 also incorporates the circular velocity as @xmath212 , which in general dominates over the non - circular motions @xmath213 and @xmath114 .",
    "this results in a phase - shift @xmath214 that is everywhere close to zero , and due to the degeneracy in @xmath26 there is little hope of constraining a two - arm spiral perturbation from its contribution to the @xmath210 harmonic term in the velocity field .",
    "however , we can predict its pitch angle @xmath215 and phase - shift @xmath216 from the ( logarithmic ) spiral inferred from the contribution to the @xmath217 harmonic term : @xmath218 and @xmath219 . as a result",
    ", we might use @xmath220 as an estimate of the non - circular contribution to @xmath26 .",
    "the effect is shown in the top - right panel of figure  [ fig : hardec_profiles ] , where the black dashed curve is @xmath221 of the ( power - law ) axisymmetric potential , which after taking into account @xmath213 yields the blue dashed curve that matches the measured @xmath26 coefficients indicated by the blue diamonds .",
    "this provides a novel way to correct for non - circular motions , which otherwise might , for example , lead to an underestimation of the ( inner ) slope of the mass distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "there are several effects that might ( partly ) cause this additional contribution .",
    "as shown by @xcite ( @xcite , their equation  7 ) , an error in the ( kinematic ) center results in a spurious @xmath222 and @xmath137 contribution to the line - of - sight velocity as @xmath223,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the effect on @xmath224 and @xmath225 vanishes if @xmath226 , i.e. , when the circular velocity curve increases linearly with radius , @xmath227 . as in most galaxies ,",
    "the latter is also the case in the inner region of ngc1097 , but still @xmath224 is significantly positive within the central @xmath228 .",
    "not surprisingly , varying the kinematic center ( in the process of finding the best - fit set of ellipses as described in section  [ sec : expansion ] ) does not remove the @xmath137 harmonic contribution , but in contrast makes the overall fit worse . this makes a significant effect due to an incorrect center unlikely .",
    "based on the analysis in section  [ sec : potentialpertubation ] , we expect a similar contribution of both @xmath222 and @xmath137 harmonic terms to the velocity field from an @xmath210 distortion of an axisymmetric distribution .",
    "as mentioned above in section  [ sec : spiralmodel ] , it is unlikely that the gravitational potential itself is lopsided since the stars that dominate in mass do not show any such signature . also , the nuclear spiral itself is expected to be bi - symmetric if it is indeed a gas density wave driven by the large - scale bar .",
    "still , the phase - shift @xmath229 in the bottom - middle panel of figure  [ fig : hardec_profiles ] seems to vary smoothly , and even close to linearly as a function of @xmath133 within the central @xmath230 where prominent dust features are present .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the slope is similar to the linear relation of @xmath132 versus @xmath133 in the bottom - right panel , but with negative instead of positive sign .",
    "this is consistent with a logarithmic spiral with the same pitch angle but orientated clockwise instead of anti - clockwise , i.e. , leading instead of trailing . in principle , both leading and trailing nuclear spirals can exist , as shown by @xcite , but in their simulations the smaller leading spiral dissolves before the long - lived larger trailing spiral fully emerges .",
    "alternatively , the spiral - like contribution to the @xmath137 harmonic term , appearing like a `` negative image '' , might result from an asymmetric dust obscuration , mimicking a lopsided distortion .",
    "the often prominent dust lanes along the leading edges of bars in galaxies are associated with shocks in the gas streaming along the length of the bar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which in turn lead to velocity jumps across the dust lanes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , numerical models of dust lanes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as analytical models of diffuse disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that dust extinction can have a significant effect on the velocity along the line - of - sight .",
    "henceforth , we expect the dust and possible shocks associated with the spiral features to distort the velocity field , but the modeling required to understand the specific effects on the non - circular motion is beyond the scope of this paper .      the eddington accretion rate onto a central black hole @xmath231 adopting @xmath232 for the radiative efficiency , and a mass @xmath233m@xmath3  for the central black hole in ngc1097 based on the measured central stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath234kms@xmath4  @xcite substituted in the @xmath235 relation @xcite yields @xmath236m@xmath3yr@xmath4 .",
    "this value is indicated in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : mass_inflow_rate ] by the upper dashed horizontal line .",
    "the lower dotted horizontal line at @xmath237 is the approximate transition from a seyfert1 to a liner active galactic nucleus ( see for a review * ? ? ?",

    "our mass inflow rate is significantly lower than @xmath243m@xmath3yr@xmath4  estimated by @xcite at a distance @xmath244pc . in the latter estimate ,",
    "a non - circular motion of @xmath191kms@xmath4  is adopted for the inflow velocity , whereas we find from our spiral model that even though the contribution of the radial inflow dominates over elliptic streaming , it is still only a fraction ( @xmath245kms@xmath4  at @xmath246pc ) of the non - circular motions .",
    "moreover , the estimated electron density of @xmath247@xmath188  is similar to the average density we derive directly from emission line ratios , but more than an order of magnitude higher than the expected ( over)density in the spiral arms ( @xmath248@xmath188  at @xmath246pc ) .",
    "finally , instead of assuming a fixed opening angle of @xmath249@xmath1 , we incorporate the geometry from the spiral model , and allow for the scale height to vary , in order for the disk to remain marginally stable . in this way",
    ", we obtain an estimate of the mass inflow rate fully consistent with the expected mass accretion rate onto the central bh in ngc1097 , without having to invoke an unclear filling factor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "even so , the mass inflow rate might be even further constrained , in particular by measuring emission line ratios at higher signal - to - noise to obtain a more accurate estimate of the ( over)density , as well as using other emission lines to break the degeneracy with temperature .",
    "even though the ratios of emission lines constrain the total gas density in the nuclear spiral , most likely only part of the gas is ionized . on the other hand ,",
    "the high amount of radial damping needed for the spiral model to match the observed non - circular motions ( section  [ sec : spiralmodel ] ) , indicates strong dissipation , possibly due to shocks that in turn can ionize a significant fraction of the gas . at the same time",

    "3 ) , consistent with a @xmath137 spiral perturbation in the gravitational potential . however , the corresponding velocity field after subtraction of an axisymmetric disk model ( their fig .  5 ) does not reveal a clear three - arm spiral structure , as seen in the non - circular motions of the ionized gas ( figure  [ fig : hardec_maps ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the kinematics of the ionized gas better trace the nuclear spiral , whereas the corresponding three - arm spiral is weaker in the non - circular motions of the cold gas , and perhaps more contaminated by a @xmath137 contribution through asymmetric dust obscuration .",
    "we presented harmonic expansion of the line - of - sight velocity field as a suitable method to identify and quantify possible structures in the non - circular motions , including nuclear spirals .",

    "instead , we postulated that an asymmetric dust obscuration mimics a lopsided distortion , and gives rise to the additional even harmonic terms in the velocity field .    to match the measured odd harmonic terms in the velocity field of ngc1097 , a spiral perturbation model with a large amount of radial damping",
