    "the m dwarfs are the most numerous stars in our galaxy .",
    "they are quite poorly investigated because of the selection effect .",
    "the values of masses , radii , luminosities and temperatures are less than those of 30 binaries with low - mass eclipsing binary components given by @xcite .",
    "the mass - temperature and temperature - radii relation is determined by only a few low - mass stars .",
    "this situation has prevented the development of the models for the m dwarfs .",
    "it is created that all available models underestimate the radii ( by around 10 - 15 per cent ) and overestimate the temperatures ( by 200 - 300 k ) of short and long period binaries with m components @xcite .",
    "the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ) contains a great number of photometric data @xcite that allows searching of variable stars and determination of their periods and types of variability .",
    "one of them was nsvs07394765 @xmath9 2mass j082551 + 242725 ( @xmath8=08@xmath10 , @xmath11= + @xmath12 ) .    on the base of the nsvs photometry obtained in 19992000 we derived the ephemeris : hjd(mini)=2451503.363 + 2.2656 @xmath13 e and built its light curve ( fig.1 ) .",
    "initially nsvs07394765 attracted our interest by its very active components because there were only several systems with non - degenerate components and periods above the long - period limit of 4.26 days @xcite : cucnc @xcite with @xmath14 d , 2mass j01542930 + 0053266 @xcite with @xmath15 d , and t - cyg1 - 12664 @xcite with @xmath16 d.    when we determined that the components of nsvs07394765 were low - mass eclipsing binary our interest increased and we undertook intensive photometric and spectral observations in order to determine its global parameters and to add a new information for the low - mass stars as well as for the very active and binary masses between 0.2 - 0.4m@xmath3 .",
    "nsvs07394765 was first identified in the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ; wozniak et al .",
    "2004 ) as a detached eclipsing binary system with a maximum , out - of - eclipse v - bandpass magnitude @xmath17=12@xmath18.75 and a period of @xmath19 d. the data from the nsvs , obtained with the robotic optical transient search experiment telescopes ( rotse ) , contains positions , light curves and v magnitudes for about 14 million objects ranging in magnitudes from 8 to 15.5 .",
    "the b , v , r , and i magnitudes for nsvs07394765 were listed in the usno nomad catalog as ( naval observatory merged astronomical dataset , nomad-1.0 , @xcite , b=14@xmath18.35 , v=13@xmath18.9 , r=11@xmath18.42 and i=11@xmath18.22 ; on the other hand the infra - red magnitudes in three bandpasses were given as j=10@xmath18.554 , h=9@xmath18.880 and k=9@xmath18.720 in the 2mass catalog @xcite .",
    "the photometric observations of nsvs07394765 were carried out with the 0.4 m telescope at the ege university observatory .",
    "the 0.4 m telescope equipped with an apogee ccd camera and standard bessel bvri bandpasses .",
    "the observations were performed on five nights between february01 and march30 , 2009 . to get the higher accuracy the target nsvs07394765",
    "was placed near to the center of the ccd and three nearby stars located on the same frame were taken for comparison .",
    "the field of the variable and standard stars is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the stars tyc1941 - 1874 - 1 and hd70897 were selected as comparison and check , respectively .",
    "therefore the target and comparison stars could be observed simultaneously with an exposure time of 10 seconds .",
    "the differential observations of the comparison stars showed that they are stable during time span of our observations .",
    "the data were processed with standard data reduction procedures including bias and over scan subtraction , flat - fielding , and aperture photometry .",
    "the average uncertainty of each differential measurement was less than 0@xmath18.030 .",
    "the b- , v- , r- and i - bandpass magnitude differences , in the sense of variable minus comparison , are listed in table1 ( available in the electronic form at the cds ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to study the kinematical properties of nsvs07394765",
    ", we used the system s centre - of - mass velocity , distance and proper motion values , which are given in table5 .",
    "the proper motion data were taken from 2mass catalogue @xcite , whereas the centre - of - mass velocity and distance are obtained in this study .",
    "the system s space velocity was calculated using @xcite algorithm .",
    "the u , v and w space velocity components and their errors were obtained and given in table5 . to obtain the space velocity",
    "precisely , the first - order galactic differential rotation correction was taken into account @xcite , and -1.08 and 0.65 differential corrections were applied to u and v space velocity components , respectively .",
    "the w velocity is not affected in this first - order approximation . as for the lsr ( local standard of rest )",
    "correction , @xcite values ( 9 , 12 , 7)@xmath3 were used and the final space velocity of nsvs07394765 was obtained as _ s_=21 .",
    "this value is in agreement with space velocities of the young stars .",
    "the h@xmath8 emission lines from the system is an useful indicator of chromospheric activity for late  type stars , in particularly mdwarfs .",
    "typically , mdwarfs are divided into 4 subsets by @xcite in conformity with the strength of chromospheric activity .",
    "the lowest degree of chromospheric active mdwarfs have feeble h@xmath8 absorption line in a spectrum . as the chromosphere increases the equivalent width of the h@xmath8 absorption increases , then reducing and finally h@xmath8 goes into the emission .",
    "h@xmath8 emission from the nsvs07394765 was present in every observed spectrum , as shown in fig.6 as a function of the selected orbital phase .",
    "this is usual property of mdwarfs in general , because of the magnetic activity is frequently characterized by strong and variable h@xmath8 line emission .",
    "emission line characteristic varies with mdwarfs age , spectral type ( particularly m2 or later ) , and the lifetime of magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "like this variety also seen from the mdwarfs in close binary systems with other dwarf stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we measured the h@xmath8 equivalent width for each spectra and investigated variety of the strength of emissions .",
    "although it seemed to change unusually in the range 3.2 - 4.4    with orbital phase we noted a trend of the equivalent width to be higher level of h@xmath8 equivalent width at conjuncture .",
    "the h@xmath8 structure was observed to be broader and stronger than other activity indicators line ( e.g. ca  i absorption lines and h@xmath20 emission lines ) .",
    "comparison of the structure with some binaries with low - mass m components from the @xcite reveals the strong h@xmath8 emission of the system .",
    "this conclusion is not suprising taking into account the low temperature and fast rotation of its components .",
    "the mean value equivalent width 4    of the h@xmath8 emission of nsvs07394765 is considerably smaller than that of the accreting pre - main sequence dme stars which h@xmath8 emission width has greater than ten angstrom .    besides the variability of the line profiles there is information about optical flares of the system in the obtained photometrical data .",
    "generally , flare activity is typical for late - type stars . until recently ,",
    "the active mdwarfs in close binary system in the literature was cmdra , v405and , yygem and gsc2314 - 0530 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it should be noted that 2 observed flares occured around the hjd54526.35 and 54529.31 .",
    "this involves correlation between the two signs of stellar activity : spots and flares .",
    "both of them are appearances of the long  lived active area on the components .",
    "no other demonstrative clues for accretion , or outflow in the form of emission structure was observed .",
    "it does not appear that the h@xmath8 emission is partially coming from the third body or other physically processes , but more likely from many distributed active region on both stars .",
    "longer duration and higher resolution spectroscopic monitoring would be necessary to accurately determine the geometry of the h@xmath8 emission regions , and the active region timescales .",
    "lines are shown at several phases .",
    "dashed lines shows the resulting fit of gaussians to the line profile with letters indicating each component . ]",
    "the analysis of our photometric and spectral observations of the eclipsing binary nsvs07394765 allows us to derive the following conclusions :    we have presented follow up photometric and first time spectroscopic observations of a low - mass binary , nsvs07394765 , whose total mass of the components are below the limit of full convection dwarfs .",
    "the components of the system have masses typical m2 and m4 , are in detached configuration .    by simultaneous radial velocity solution and light curve solution we determined the global parameters of the system described in  4 and showed in table5 .",
    "in fig.7 we derived empirical positions of the nsvs07394765 components in the mass - radius ( m - r ) and mass - effective temperatures ( m - t@xmath21 ) planes relative to those of the well - determined low - mass dm components in the eclipsing binary systems .",
    "theoretical m - r diagrams for a zero - age main - sequence stars with [ m / h]=0 taken from the @xcite are also plotted to comparison . due to the high magnetic activity in",
    "the fast - rotating dwarfs their surfaces are covered by dark spot(s ) or spot groups .",
    "spot coverage in active dwarfs yields larger radii and lower effective temperatures .",
    "the distorted light curve of nsvs07394765 were reproduced by two cool spots on the primary component .",
    "the next sign of the activity of the system is the strong h@xmath8 emission of its components .",
    "moreover we registered 2 flares of nsvs07394765 .",
    "both of them occurred at the phases of maximum visibility of the larger stable cool spot on the primary .",
    "the analysis of all appearances of magnetic activity revealed existence of long - lived active area on the primary of the system .",
    "the high activity of the target is natural consequence of the fast rotation and low temperatures of its components .",
    "our study on one of the lowest - mass eclipsing binary nsvs07394765 presents a next small step toward understanding dme stars and adds a new information to the poor statistic of the low - mass dm stars .",
    "recently they became especially interesting as appropriate targets for planet searches due to the relative larger transit depths .",
