    "in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) , the broadband channel is divided into several orthogonal , narrowband subchannels which are known as subcarriers .",
    "user data is modulated onto each subcarrier before transmission .",
    "the bandwidth of these subcarriers is usually smaller than the channel coherence bandwidth ; therefore , ofdm systems are able to deliver high data rates with high bandwidth efficiency and robust performance in a frequency fading environment . due to these aforementioned technical advantages",
    ", ofdm has been adopted in wireless local area network standards such as ieee 802.11a / g / n / ac and fourth generation ( 4 g ) cellular technology .",
    "although ofdm offers several advantages , it is sensitive to frequency offset and suffers from high peak average power ratio ( papr ) which is due to the nonlinearity in high power amplifiers ( hpas ) .",
    "@xcite    in order to improve the bit error rate ( ber ) performance of a wireless communication system , forward error correction ( fec ) codes are often implemented and utilized .",
    "fec mitigates signal degradation by adding redundancy to transmissions .",
    "typically an fec encoder takes @xmath0 bits of user data as input , and outputs @xmath1 bits .",
    "therefore , among the @xmath2 sequences of @xmath3 bits , only @xmath4 of them are valid transmissions . if the sequence is slightly altered in transmission , the received signal is usually more similar to the transmitted sequence than to any other valid transmission , making it possible for the receiver to perfectly recover the transmitted sequence and the user data .",
    "soft - decision fec decoding makes use of the fact that some bits are received less ambiguously than others .",
    "convolutional codes and turbo codes been used with ofdm @xcite , but we have not seen any work that used polar codes with ofdm .",
    "polar codes are a new form of fec introduced in 2009 by arikan , who proved they can achieve the capacity of any binary memoryless symmetric ( bms ) channel with efficient encoding and decoding @xcite .",
    "the decoding method described in @xcite is called successive cancellation ( sc ) .",
    "section [ polar ] describes polar codes in detail .",
    "one major disadvantage of sc is that the decoder can not correct an error made earlier in the process . in @xcite , tal and",
    "vardy introduced _",
    "list decoding _ , also called _ successive cancellation list decoding ( scl ) _ , to mitigate this problem .",
    "they found that a list decoder s error correction performance is significantly better than sc , at the cost of higher computational complexity .",
    "they also found that performance can be further improved by using a concatenated code , with a cyclic redundancy check ( crc ) encoder followed by a polar encoder .",

    "the encoder constructs @xmath92 by filling @xmath93 with @xmath0 information bits , and setting @xmath94 to predetermined values , usually all 0 s .",
    "these predetermined values are called _ frozen _ bits .",
    "the encoder outputs @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the @xmath3 by @xmath3 matrix @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath98 is its @xmath65th tensor power .",

    "we call this _ bit - reversed polar coding_. in either case the encoder and decoder can be implemented with complexity @xmath102 .",

    "encoder starts by computing a crc from the information bits , and then it applies the usual polar encoding with the crc included in the input .",

    "when we used the same interleaver with a non - bit - reversed polar code , we found that the result was worse than without interleaving .",
    "this can be explained by observing that the non - bit - reversed polar code already includes an interleaver , and much of its effect was canceled by the block interleaver .    as explained in @xcite , polar coding",
    "is based on an operation called _ polarization _ ( or _ combining and splitting _ ) that transforms a pair of it channels into two new it channels .",

    "we will call this situation _ deep fade_. when the average total energy is high , deep fade causes most of the bit errors .    strategies to handle deep fade depend on latency requirements , how long the fade lasts , and whether the transmitter is able to adapt to it ( for example , by adjusting the data rate . ) without such adaptation , we need to add diversity . for example , we could increase time diversity with an interleaver several times longer than the fade duration .",

    "<S> orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has gained a lot of popularity over the years . due to its popularity </S>",
    "<S> , ofdm has been adopted as a standard in cellular technology and wireless local area network ( wlan ) communication systems . to improve the bit error rate ( ber ) performance , forward error correction ( fec ) codes are often utilized to protect signals against unknown interference and channel degradations . in this paper , we apply soft - decision fec , more specifically polar codes and a convolutional code , to an ofdm system in a quasi - static multipath fading channel , and compare ber performance in various channels . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effect of interleaving bits within a polar codeword . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the simulation results for each case are presented in the paper . </S>"
