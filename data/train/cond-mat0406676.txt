    "he wrote the excitation energy of the fermi - liquid in terms of the energies of the qp s and of their effective interactions .",
    "the qp - qp interaction function can in turn be used to obtain various physical properties of the system and can be parametrized in terms of experimentally measurable data .",

    "all these approaches considered only the charge - density fluctuations while neglecting the effect of the spin - density fluctuations .    a more detailed analysis that accounts for the vertex corrections associated with both types of fluctuations was carried out for an unpolarized eg in refs .  , where kukkonen - overhauser - like  @xcite effective interactions were obtained by different approaches .",

    "thus , the dielectric mimics the true physical processes in an average way . of course , the test electrons and the electrons of the medium are physically indistinguishable , and this must be taken into account when exchange effects are considered . at this point , after averaging over the coordinates of the screening medium , an effective renormalized hamiltonian containing only the degrees of freedom of the clothed test electrons ( or qp s ) can be derived , under the assumption that the coupling with the medium occurs only _ via _ its charge- and spin - density fluctuations . the basic idea underlying",
