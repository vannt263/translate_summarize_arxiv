    "another application of the resolvent estimate of theorem  [ theorem : resest ] is to the damped wave equation .",
    "although we do not pursue it here , under suitable convexity assumptions ( e.g. , if no geodesic passing through the perturbed region re - enters it ; see datchev ",
    "vasy  @xcite for more general conditions ) , it is possible to obtain decay estimates for the damped wave equation on conic manifolds when the only undamped geodesics are diffractive ones .",
    "this relies on a gluing construction of datchev  vasy to obtain a suitable resolvent estimate and on the recent work of christianson , schenck , vasy and the second author  @xcite to yield the estimate .",
    "in addition to applying to manifolds with cone points , our results also apply to the more elementary setting of certain exterior domains to polygons in the plane .",

    "we further suppose that the complement @xmath33 is connected , that no three vertices of @xmath34 are collinear , and that @xmath33 is non - trapping , in the sense that all billiard trajectories not passing through the vertices of @xmath34 escape to infinity .",

    "the proof of corollary  [ corollary : polygon ] relies on reducing the problem to one on a surface with conic singularites .",
    "indeed , such an exterior domain can be _ doubled _ by gluing together two copies of it across the common boundary ; this results in a manifold with cone points , corresponding to the vertices of the initial polygonal domain , and with two ends each isometric to @xmath36 solutions to the wave equation in this `` doubled '' manifold are closely related to solutions to the dirichlet or neumann problem on the original exterior domain via the method of images .",
    "our results hold for the exterior problem to such non - trapping polygons as well , although this entails some mild complication in the proof ( the introduction of `` black - box '' methods)see section  [ sec : exter - polyg - doma ] below .",
    "in particular , our result affirmatively answers a conjecture of chandler - wilde , graham , langdon , and spence  @xcite . in the case",
    "when the obstacle is star - shaped , we remark that the exponential energy decay is a consequence of the classical technique of morawetz estimates ( see e.g. lemma 3.5 of @xcite ) ) ; we believe that the estimate for general non - trapping polygons is new , however .",
    "we note that stronger estimates than those of theorem  [ theorem : resest ] are known to hold in the case of a non - trapping metric or even an appropriately non - trapping `` black box '' perturbation such as a smooth non - trapping obstacle ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : in these cases there are finitely many resonances above _ any _ logarithmic curve @xmath37 that the result here is likely to be sharp can be seen from the explicit computation of burq @xcite , who shows that in the case of obstacle scattering by two strictly convex analytic obstacles in @xmath38 one of which has a corner , the resonances ( poles of the analytic continuation of the resolvent @xmath39 ) are located along curves of the form @xmath40 burq s setting is not of course exactly that of manifolds with cone points , but is suggestively close to that of polygonal domains discussed above .",
    "( similar logarithmic strings of resonance poles also appear in zworski  @xcite where they are shown to arise from finite order singularities of a one - dimensional potential , substantiating heuristics from regge @xcite . )    by contrast , what seems the weakest trapping possible in the setting of smooth manifolds , a single closed hyperbolic geodesic , is known in certain settings to produce strings of resonances along lines of constant imaginary part @xcite , and hence yields an analytic continuation to a smaller region than that shown here , which does not permit a resonance wave expansion in the strong sense of corollary  [ corollary : resexp ] except in very special cases @xcite .    the fact that the estimates demonstrated here are weaker , by only a very small margin , than those for non - trapping situations , reflects that fact that cone points induce a kind of `` weak trapping : '' there exist geodesics connecting every pair of cone points , and concatenation of such geodesics starting and ending at the same cone point should be considered a legitimate geodesic curve in a conic geometry . in particular , such concatenations of geodesics are known ( generically ) to propagate singularities of the wave equation on exact cones by results of cheeger - taylor @xcite ; this reflects the _ diffraction _ of singularities by the cone point .",
    "melrose and the second author @xcite subsequently showed that on any manifold with conic singularities , the propagation of singularities is limited to geodesics entering and leaving a given cone point at the same time ( `` diffractive propagation '' ) .",
    "it was further shown in @xcite that the fundamental solution of the wave group with initial pole near a cone point was _ smoother _ along generic geodesics emerging from the cone point than along those that are approximable by geodesics emanating from the initial pole and missing the cone point ; this `` smoothing effect '' in fact holds for any solution that satisfies an appropriate _ nonfocusing _ condition with respect to the cone point in question ( see section  [ section : mw ] below ) .",
    "thus , colloquially , @xcite showed that `` diffracted singularities are smoother than geometrically propagated singularities . ''",
    "it also showed that the spherical wavefront of diffracted singularities is a conormal wave .",
    "it is the smoothing property and the conormality that play an essential role in the proof of theorem  [ theorem : resest ] .",
    "the proof proceeds via another result which may be of independent interest , a theorem on the _ weak non - trapping of singularities _ for manifolds with cone points . in the following theorem",

    "our theorem  [ theorem : huygens ] is weaker yet : here the cut - off wave kernel is as smooth as one likes , after a sufficiently long time .",

    "it is most easily interpreted as showing a domain with boundary given by the three slits ; geodesics then reflect off smooth parts of the boundary , and geometric geodesics either pass straight through the end of the slits or reflect specularly as if the slits continued .",
