    "despite the enormous success of the standard model ( sm ) , the sm spectrum and dynamics are believed to be the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory .",
    "there are , indeed , strong theoretical motivations for the existence of new physics above the electroweak mass scale : the mysterious large hierarchy from the electroweak scale to the planck scale , the lack of a theory that unifies quantum physics with gravity , the observed dark matter in the universe etc ...    one of the most favorable new physics candidates which may provide a viable framework for such questions is supersymmetry ( susy ) . from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", susy offers some new attractive features which are absent in the sm and which may be tested in upcoming future colliders .",
    "one example of a fundamental difference between susy and the sm is associated with lepton number . in the sm lepton number",
    "must be conserved since it is not possible to write down a renormalizable lepton number violating interaction out of the sm fields . in susy , however , as opposed to the sm , lepton number does not have to be conserved since the most general set of susy renormalizable operators does allow for lepton number violating interactions . in particular , if one does not impose the so called r - parity symmetry @xcite on the susy lagrangian , then lepton number ( and baryon number ) can be violated at tree - level in interaction vertices involving both sparticles and particles .    therefore , since there is no fundamental principle that enforces lepton number conservation , it is clear that lepton number violating phenomena should be explored in collider experiments even in processes not involving external susy partners .",
    "such searches will provide an unambiguous test of the sm , and may give a first solid evidence about susy dynamics .",
    "the susy r - parity conserving ( rpc ) superpotential can be written as ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) :    @xmath7 ~ , \\label{lrpc}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 are the up(down)-type higgs supermultiplet and @xmath9 are the leptonic su(2 ) doublet(charged singlet ) supermultiplets .",
    "the @xmath10 are quark su(2 ) doublet supermultiplets and @xmath11 are su(2 ) up(down)-type quark singlet supermultiplets .",
    "also , @xmath12 or @xmath13 are generation labels and @xmath14 are su(2 ) indices where @xmath15 is the rank 2 anti - symmetric tensor .",
    "if r - parity is violated , then lepton number may no longer be a conserved quantum number of the theory . in this case",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 superfields , which have the same gauge quantum numbers , lose their identity since there is no additional quantum number that distinguishes between them .",
    "one can then construct additional renormalizable r - parity violating ( rpv ) interactions simply by replacing @xmath18 in ( [ lrpc ] ) .",
    "thus , the susy superpotential can violate lepton number ( or more generally r - parity ) ) and ( [ bterm ] ) either as lepton number violating or rpv interactions . ] via an rpv yukawa - like trilinear term ( rpvtt ) in the pure leptonic sector and via a mass - like rpv bilinear term ( rpvbt ) as follows @xcite : is not relevant for our calculations . ]",
    "@xmath19 ~. \\label{lp}\\ ] ]    moreover , if r - parity is not conserved then , in addition to the usual rpc soft susy breaking terms , one must also add new trilinear and bilinear soft terms corresponding to the rpv terms of the superpotential , e.g. , to the ones in ( [ lp ] ) .",
    "for our purpose , the relevant ones to be added to the susy scalar potential are the following soft breaking mass - like terms @xcite :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the scalar components of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the presence of such lepton number violating interactions in the susy lagrangian drastically changes the phenomenology of susy .",
    "in general the new phenomenological implications of a rpv susy framework can be categorized according to the combinations of the rpv couplings involved .",
    "for example , one of the most interesting effects of the rpvtt in the superpotential is the possibility of having an @xmath0-channel sneutrino resonance formation in fermion pair production in leptonic colliders @xcite .",
    "such an effect will be proportional either to the product @xmath23 ( if a pair of leptons is produced ) or to the product @xmath24 ( if a pair of down - type quarks is produced ) , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the trilinear rpv couplings in the superpotential ( omitting subscripts ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig0](a ) . among the interesting phenomenological implication associated with the rpvbt in the superpotential",
    "are tree - level neutrino masses @xcite and flavor changing @xmath27-decays ( see e.g. , bisset _ et al .",
    "_ , in @xcite ) ; these effects are , therefore , proportional to the products @xmath28 ( omitting subscripts ) , where @xmath29 are the bilinear rpv couplings in the superpotential , see fig .",
    "[ fig0](b ) .",
    "there are also new phenomena associated only with the soft rpvbt of the scalar potential , i.e. , with the @xmath30 terms in ( [ bterm ] ) . some examples for that are one - loop neutrino masses @xcite and new scalar decay channels @xcite",
    ". these will be proportional to the soft bilinear rpv coupling @xmath30 and arise as a consequence of mixings in the scalar sector between the sleptons and the higgs fields , see fig .",
    "[ fig0](c ) .",
    "there are also rpv flavor changing phenomena in the susy fermionic sector such as rare leptonic kaon decays and radiative muon decays , which are generated by the combined effect of the rpvtt and rpvbt in the superpotential @xcite . these type of signals will be proportional to the products @xmath31 and/or @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "[ fig0](d ) .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have suggested yet a new type of signature of lepton number violation within susy , which is proportional to the product of the rpvtt coupling @xmath25 in the superpotential and the soft breaking rpvbt coupling @xmath30 of the susy scalar potential , i.e. , @xmath33 - see fig .",
    "[ fig0](e ) .",
    "in particular , we have shown that one can have an observable scalar  resonance enhancement in the cross - section for producing a pair of massive gauge - bosons :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , are admixtures of the rpc",
    "cp - even neutral higgs states and the sneutrino fields as described below .. ]    in this paper we wish to extend the analysis performed in @xcite and , in addition , to investigate the effect of this type of rpv scalar resonances on top - quark pair production :    @xmath37    the new resonance signal in top - quark pair production involves also @xmath0-channel exchanges of the cp - odd scalar states ( i.e. , of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , which are admixtures of the rpc cp - odd neutral higgs and the cp - odd sneutrino fields ) , whereas in @xmath40 production only the cp - even admixtures ( @xmath41 ) contribute since the cp - odd scalars do not couple to @xmath40 at tree - level @xcite .. we do not discuss this possibility here . ]",
    "such scalar resonances in top and massive gauge - boson pair production can arise with measurable consequences when the incoming @xmath1 beams couple to the sneutrino component in the new physical states , @xmath42 or @xmath43 , with a coupling @xmath44 ( that is the typical higgs coupling to the incoming beams ) in ( [ lp ] ) , while the @xmath40 and the @xmath45 final states couple to the higgs components either in @xmath42 or in @xmath43 .",
    "then , a non - vanishing scalar resonance in @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be attributed to the higgs  sneutrino mixing phenomena , and can serve as an exclusive probe of the soft breaking rpvbt in the susy scalar potential ( i.e. , of @xmath30 ) .",
    "indeed , the resonance effects are essentially proportional to the product @xmath48 which will vanish as @xmath49 .",
    "this differs from the situation of down - quark pair production via @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) where the rpv scalar resonance may occur in two ways : ( @xmath52 ) when the sneutrino component in @xmath42 or in @xmath43 couples to both the @xmath1 and @xmath53 through its trilinear rpv couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ( see e.g. , @xcite for a discussion of such a sneutrino resonance effect in @xmath54 ) ; ( @xmath30 ) when the sneutrino component couples to @xmath1 then mixes with the higgs state which couples to the @xmath53 final state .",
    "it is clear that in down quark pair production such a scalar resonance will be dominated by the purely rpvtt effect of type ( @xmath52 ) above , as long as @xmath26 is larger than the small yukawa coupling of the neutral higgs to down - quarks . in particular ,",
    "an observable scalar resonance enhancement in @xmath53 production is possible even when @xmath49 and only the rpvtt contributes . on the other hand , in the @xmath45 production channel",
    ", the purely rpvtt effect of type ( 1 ) above is absent at tree - level ( the @xmath55 coupling is forbidden by gauge - invariance ) .",
    "similarly , there is no tree - level @xmath56 coupling when the soft breaking rpvbt vanishes , i.e. , when @xmath49 .",
    "thus , in contrast with down - quark and charged - lepton pair production in which a measurable scalar resonance enhancement is expected to emanate from the purely trilinear rpv couplings , in the channels considered here , the scalar resonance enhancement will arise only if the sneutrino and the higgs states mix via the soft rpvbt .",
    "we therefore stress again that the scalar resonance formations in @xmath45 and @xmath40 production are fundamentally different from previously suggested sneutrino resonances in leptonic colliders within rpv susy ( e.g. , in fermion pair production @xcite ) , since they are driven by rpv parameters from the soft breaking scalar sector and not purely by yukawa - like rpv couplings from the superpotential .",
    "it should also be noted that the mechanism of a scalar resonance via sneutrino  higgs mixing that we are considering here will not be efficient for light up - quark ( i.e. , u and c - quarks ) pair production due to the smallness of the corresponding higgs-@xmath57-@xmath58 and the higgs-@xmath59-@xmath60 yukawa couplings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define our low energy rpv susy framework and assumptions , we present the cp - even and cp - odd scalar mass matrices in the presence of the soft rpvbt and discuss their behavior in some limiting cases . in section",
    "iii we derive the relevant feynman rules for the new scalar mass - eigenstates and we calculate the cross - sections for the @xmath0-channel scalar exchanges in @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in section",
    "iv we present our numerical results for the expected resonance signals in @xmath63 , scanning the relevant susy parameter space at lep2 and future linear colliders . in section",
    "v we investigate the sensitivity of future linear colliders to such scalar resonance signals in @xmath64 . in section",
    "vi we present our conclusions .",
    "in what follows , for simplicity we will assume @xmath65 only when @xmath66 in ( [ bterm ] ) , thus , considering only the mixing between the stau ( @xmath67 ) and the higgs scalar fields ( @xmath22 and @xmath68 ) .",
    "the consequences of @xmath69 and/or @xmath70 is to introduce additional mixings among sleptons of different generations and mixings between the selectron and/or smuon with the higgs fields which are not crucial for the main outcome of this paper .",
    "the bilinear soft term @xmath71 leads in general to a non - vanishing vev of the tau - sneutrino , @xmath72 .",
    "however , since lepton number is not a conserved quantum number in this scenario , the @xmath17 and @xmath73 superfields lose their identity and can be rotated to a particular basis ( @xmath74 ) in which either @xmath75 or @xmath76 are set to zero @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we find it convenient to choose the `` no vev '' basis , @xmath77 , which simplifies our analysis below .",
    "furthermore , our key assumption will be that the lepton number violating couplings in the susy lagrangian are small compared to the corresponding rpc ones wherever they appear . more specifically , the rpv parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath71 , will be limited such that @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is worth noting that the minimization of the scalar potential yields ( in the @xmath77 basis ) @xcite : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "thus , in the general case , @xmath71 needs not vanish even if @xmath75 is vanishingly small , as may be suggested by low energy flavor changing processes ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and flavor changing @xmath27-decays ( see e.g. , bisset _ et al .",
    "_ , in @xcite ) . in particular , if @xmath82 ( so that @xmath83 ) then @xmath84 , in which case rpv in the scalar potential decouples from the rpv in the superpotential ( i.e. , @xmath71 is independent of @xmath75 ) .",
    "in such a case , small lepton number violation in the scalar potential should be realized by requiring only that @xmath85.-neutrino mass allows @xmath86 @xcite ] in this paper we will adopt this approach which treats rpv in the scalar potential independently from rpv in the superpotential .",
    "let us define the su(2 ) components of the up and down neutral higgs and tau - sneutrino scalar fields : to denote what would be the scalar states in the rpc limit @xmath87 . ]",
    "@xmath88    where , as stated above , in the following discussion we always set @xmath77 .",
    "the cp - even and cp - odd @xmath89 symmetric scalar squared - mass matrices @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively , are then obtained through the quadratic part of the scalar potential :    @xmath92    where    @xmath93    are the su(2 ) weak states .",
    "the new cp - even and cp - odd scalar mass - eigenstates ( i.e. , the physical states ) are derived by diagonalizing @xmath94 .",
    "let us denote the physical states by :    @xmath95    such that for small rpv in the susy lagrangian , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the states dominated by the cp - even rpc states @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , and @xmath100 are the states dominated by the cp - odd rpc states @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath102 is the goldstone boson that is absorbed by the @xmath27-boson and , therefore , is the state with a zero eigenvalue in @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the physical states ( @xmath103 ) are related to the weak eigenstates ( @xmath104 ) via @xmath105 , where @xmath106 are the rotation matrices that diagonalize @xmath94 :    @xmath107    @xmath108    as in ( [ semese ] ) and ( [ somoso ] ) and throughout the rest of the paper , we will denote by @xmath109 and @xmath110 the masses of the cp - even and cp - odd physical states ( when @xmath111 ) , respectively .",
    "similarly , adding the superscript @xmath112 , @xmath113,@xmath114,@xmath115,@xmath116 will denote the corresponding masses in the rpc limit ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "note that in the rpc limit the cp - even and cp - odd tau - sneutrino states , @xmath99 and @xmath117 , do not mix , and are , therefore , degenerate with a common mass @xmath118 .    in the rpc limit",
    "the higgs and sneutrino sectors decouple",

    "below we use the present lep2 lower bound on @xmath137 in order to place limits on our rpv parameter space .",
    "the higher order corrections to the tree - level cp - even higgs sector are , therefore , essential in evaluating the true theoretical value of the light higgs mass , @xmath137 , since they can generate a significant deviation ( up to @xmath138 ) to the tree - level value of @xmath137 .    let us further note the following :    * above we have `` traded '' the rpc soft breaking bilinear mass term @xmath121 for the `` bare '' pseudo - scalar higgs mass @xmath116 ( i.e. , what would have been the physical mass of the pseudo - scalar higgs state if r - parity were conserved ) , by using the rpc tree - level relation @xmath139 which , for @xmath140 , implies @xmath141 . as will be shown below , for small rpv ( @xmath142 ) , @xmath143 and the new pseudo - scalar mass - eigenstate @xmath144 are almost degenerate ( i.e. , @xmath145 ) if no accidental mass degeneracy occurs .",
    "this clearly follows from our definition of quantities which are denoted with the superscript @xmath112 .",
    "hence , with the assumption of small rpv ( @xmath146 ) @xmath147 also scales as @xmath148 , for @xmath140 . without loss of generality",
    "we then set : + @xmath149 + such that the small lepton number violation in the scalar sector is parameterized by the dimensionless quantity @xmath150 .",
    "then @xmath151 corresponds to @xmath85 . * as can be seen from ( [ me2 ] ) and ( [ mo2 ] ) , as a result of @xmath152 , the usual cp - even rpc higgs states @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) will acquire a small @xmath99 component and vice versa due to the non - zero @xmath156 elements .",
    "similarly , due to @xmath157 , the rpc pseudo - scalar state @xmath143 will acquire a small @xmath117 component and vice versa . * setting @xmath158 ,",
    "our relevant low - energy susy parameter space is fully determined at tree - level by the four parameters @xmath116 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "in particular , these four parameters completely fix @xmath162 and @xmath91 at tree - level from which the cp - even and cp - odd rotation matrices @xmath163 and @xmath164 as well as the tree - level physical masses @xmath165 and @xmath166 are derived by the diagonalization procedure .    assuming that @xmath161 is a small parameter",
    ", we solve the eigenvalues equations for @xmath90 and @xmath91 perturbatively up to the second order in @xmath161 .",
    "we can thus write the new ( physical ) mass - squared eigenvalues , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , in terms of the corresponding eigenvalues in the rpc limit , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , as follows :    @xmath171    we then find that @xmath172 and    @xmath173    thus , with @xmath151 ( implying @xmath85 and also @xmath174 ) , the mass shifts induced by the rpvbt in ( [ bterm ] ) are , at leading order , @xmath175 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is evident from ( [ shift1 ] ) and ( [ shift2 ] ) that , as long as there are no accidental mass degeneracies among scalar states of the same cp property , these mass shifts will remain small for @xmath151 . hence , although we are using `` bare '' masses ( i.e. , the scalar masses in the rpc limit ) as inputs , it should be kept in mind that the physical masses are slightly shifted if there are no mass degeneracies as illustrated next .    in fig .",

    "[ fig9 ] we show the sneutrino mass intervals that can be excluded for a given @xmath461 in a measurement of the fb asymmetry in @xmath64 at a 500 gev collider by requiring ( [ fbcondition2 ] ) .",
    "the excluded mass intervals are plotted for the case @xmath406 , for @xmath359 and for @xmath217 or @xmath472 gev .",
    "clearly , the fb asymmetry is a powerful probe of this signal or , in case that no such signal is detected , is very useful in placing limits on this scenario .",
    "for example , if @xmath465 is measured at a 500 gev machine with an error not exceeding @xmath403 , then a more than 100 gev sneutrino mass interval can be excluded if no deviation from the sm is observed for @xmath406 , @xmath359 and for @xmath405 gev .",
    "at the same time , a deviation in the measured fb asymmetry will provide a candidate signal for the @xmath0-channel scalar exchanges driven by the sneutrino  higgs mixing phenomena .",
    "such additional signals beyond just resonance enhancement in the cross - section should help decipher the nature of the new physics involved .",
    "in particular , as can be seen from ( [ fbrpvtop ] ) , a reduction ( from the sm value ) in the fb asymmetry should give further evidence for @xmath0-channel scalar exchanges which in turn should strengthen the theoretical possibility of the sneutrino  higgs mixing via the lepton number violating rpvbt in ( [ bterm ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , it should be noted that in the @xmath473 system the fb asymmetry is not as useful . in particular , in @xmath6 production @xmath474 and , therefore , also @xmath475 [ see ( [ fbrpvtop ] ) and replace the index @xmath476 with @xmath27 ] .",
    "in such a case case no further information can be gained from the fb asymmetry .",
    "the reaction @xmath478 does , however , have a non - zero fb asymmetry within the sm and so the @xmath0-channel scalar exchanges will decrease the fb asymmetry from @xmath479 to @xmath480 according to ( [ fbrpvtop ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to the much larger sm @xmath481 cross - section ( as mentioned in the previous section @xmath482 ) , the effect of the sneutrino - like resonance is too small to cause an appreciable shift to @xmath479 as long as our dimensionless rpv parameters are kept below @xmath483 .",
    "for example , we find that , with @xmath406 , in the best cases ( e.g. , @xmath484 gev and @xmath359 ) the shift @xmath485 is at the level of a few percent at most in a rather small @xmath486 interval of several gev .",
    "we have investigated a susy scenario in which lepton number is violated in the scalar potential through a bilinear soft breaking term ( rpvbt ) as well as in the superpotential through a yukawa - like rpv trilinear operator ( rpvtt ) .",
    "the rpvbt gives rise to mixings between the higgs and the slepton fields and the new mass eigenstates of the neutral scalar sector are sneutrino  higgs admixtures .",
    "we considered the case of small lepton number ( or r - parity ) violation in the sense that all lepton number violating couplings are typically at least an order of magnitude smaller than their `` matching '' lepton number conserving couplings in the r - parity conserving ( rpc ) susy lagrangian .",
    "in particular , we have used dimensionless r - parity violating ( rpv ) couplings scaled to the typical rpc couplings , and let these dimensionless couplings be @xmath487 .",
    "we have carried out a detailed analysis of the cp - even and cp - odd sneutrino  higgs mass matrices in the presence of a lepton number violating bilinear term in the susy scalar potential .",
    "we have investigated their behavior under some limiting cases such as small bilinear lepton number violating coupling , a heavy higgs spectrum and large @xmath488 .",
    "also , we have derived feynman rules for interaction vertices involving the new scalar mass - eigenstates in the theory .",
    "we then suggested that this small lepton number violating susy framework may lead to new observable resonance formations in scattering processes that are absent in rpc susy and in the `` usual '' rpv susy models in which scalar resonances can occur via the trilinear yukawa - like rpv interactions in the superpotential .",
    "in particular , we focused on two particulary interesting channels , @xmath63 , @xmath489 or @xmath490 and @xmath64 .",
    "the resonance structure in these two channels arises only if there are mixings between the sneutrino and higgs states such that the sneutrino component of the sneutrino ",
    "higgs admixtures couple to the incoming electron beams through yukawa - like trilinear rpv interactions , while the higgs component couples to the massive gauge - bosons or to the top quarks .",
    "this makes the @xmath40 and @xmath45 production channels unique as compared for example to down - quark and charged lepton pair production in which the rpv @xmath0-channel resonances occur via yukawa - like trilinear rpv interactions on both vertices .",
    "such resonance signals in @xmath63 and @xmath64 may , therefore , serve as an efficient and direct probe of the rpvbt in the susy scalar potential .",
    "we found that the sneutrino - like scalars are expected to yield a dominant resonance effect in both @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and that the @xmath45 channel is much more sensitive to the lepton number violating soft bilinear term .",
    "indeed , we have shown that such a sneutrino - like resonance signal in @xmath64 is expected to yield significant deviations in observables associated with top - quark pair production which , under favorable circumstances , can be detected in a 500 gev @xmath1 collider within a 100 gev sneutrino mass range around the c.m .",
    "energy , either via `` simple '' event counting or via an analysis of the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "if such a resonance will be observed in @xmath64 , then additional measurements should be carried out in the @xmath40 production channels as a cross - check for the existence of bilinear lepton number violation in the susy scalar potential since the later are expected to yield similar resonance signals .",
    "the fact that the same resonance formation is expected to emanate in two different scattering processes will help decipher the nature of these resonance signals .    in the same vein",
    ", we have also considered the case that no such resonance enhancement is or will be seen in existing and in future collider experiments .",
    "first , we have used the recent lep2 measurements of the @xmath6 and @xmath481 production cross - sections to place direct limits on the rpv susy parameters involved in this scenario . also , since this sneutrino  higgs mixing effect changes the theoretical prediction for the mass of the light susy higgs particle @xmath200 , we have exploited the recent lep2 bounds on the @xmath200 mass to derive further limits on the same lepton number violating susy parameters .",
    "we found that the two independent lep2 measurements are complementary for placing limits on these rpv parameters and that they together exclude a significant portion of the relevant susy parameter space involved .",
    "in addition we have investigated the expected limits that can be placed on this rpv susy scenario in a future 500 gev @xmath1 collider in the case that no such resonance enhancement are detected in @xmath64 .      for reviews of r - parity violation",
