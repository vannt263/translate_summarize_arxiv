    "there is strong evidence that all massive galaxies ( not including dwarfs ) with a spheroidal component ( ellipticals , lenticulars , and early - type spirals with bulges ) host supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in their nuclei ( richstone et al .",
    "1998 ) . for a few dozen galaxies , there exist direct determinations of their nuclear masses , either from measurements of spatially - resolved stellar or gas kinematics ( for quiescent nuclei ) or from `` reverberation mapping '' of their broad - line regions ( for active nuclei ) ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ; ferrarese et al .  2001",
    "; ho 2002 ; onken et al .  2004 ; peterson et al .",
    "the masses of smbhs correlate well with fundamental properties of their host galaxies : bulge mass ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , central velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , central light concentration ( graham et al .  2001 ) and mass of the dark - matter halo ( ferrarese  2002 ) . however , this is not the case for the accreting luminosities of smbhs : while a few are active ( agn ) , sometimes with bolometric luminosities close to or above their eddington limits ( collin et al .",
    "2002 ; wang & netzer 2003 ) , the majority are not .",
    "x - ray observations of these `` silent '' smbhs have revealed faint sources with x - ray luminosities as low as @xmath10 ( fabbiano & juda 1997 ; ho 1999 ; ho et al .  2001 ; pellegrini et al .  2003a ; pellegrini 2005 ; fabbiano et al .  2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity can be expressed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass accretion rate and @xmath13 is the efficiency of conversion of gravitational energy into radiation .",
    "it is still not clear whether the extremely low luminosity of most smbhs is primarily due to a low accretion rate , or to a low radiative efficiency ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) ; see narayan ( 2002 ) for a review .",
    "if it is due to a low accretion rate , we need to determine whether this is caused by a lack of gas available in the inner few pc , or is instead the result of other phenomena ( for example accretion disk winds or jets ) that may prevent the gas from accreting onto the smbh .",
    "the most likely explanation appears to be that both low @xmath13 and low @xmath12 play a part .",
    "it has become clear that a lack of fuel can not be a general explanation : many elliptical galaxies do have large supplies of cold / warm interstellar gas at their centers ( caon , macchetto & pastoriza 2000 ; macchetto et al .  1996 ) .",
    "fabian & canizares ( 1988 ) pointed out that the accretion rate of the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) expected from the standard bondi ( 1952 ) model would still be high enough to produce x - ray luminosities at least two orders of magnitude higher than observed in the nuclei of most ellipticals , if accretion occurs efficiently ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "recent high - resolution _ chandra _ observations have led to the measurement of both the nuclear x - ray emission and of the physical parameters of the surrounding hot ism , greatly strengthening this conclusion ( e.g. , pellegrini 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "advection of energy into the smbh ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ) is a plausible mechanism for low radiative efficiency , and may be the explanation for many extremely sub - eddington sources",
    ". however , it can not be the only explanation for all sources , either .",
    "for example , advective accretion can not be invoked to explain some very under - luminous stellar - mass compact objects in our galaxy ( perna et al .",
    "low @xmath12 in addition to low @xmath13 has also been suggested as the major reason for the overall faintness of sgr a * ( bower et al .",
    "2003 ; quataert 2003 ) .",
    "hence , there is now considerable observational evidence that quiescent or very faint smbhs are at least partly due to low radiative efficiency , and partly to accretion rates onto the compact object lower than predicted from the amount of gas available .",
    "however , the physical processes responsible for this reduced accretion rate are still not well understood , and various competing models have been proposed .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , perna et al .  2003 , their sect .",
    "2.3 and references therein ) have shown that disk winds and outflows may prevent most of the inflowing gas from reaching the compact object , so that only a small fraction of the available mass is accreted .",
    "another possibility is that convection sets up a barrier to accretion , by increasing the pressure and preventing the gas from falling in supersonically ( narayan , igumenshchev , & abramowicz  2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , tan & blackman ( 2005 ) speculated that efficient cooling inside the bondi radius causes the infalling gas to condense into stars in a gravitationally unstable disk , instead of sinking into the smbh .",
    "another promising scenario is that most of the accretion power is not radiated , but is instead carried away by a steady , relativistic jet , with bulk kinetic luminosity @xmath16 . in some cases ( e.g. , m87 : di matteo et al .",
    "2003 , ic4296 : pellegrini et al .  2003b ; ic1459 : fabbiano et al .",
    "2003 ) , it has indeed been shown that including the kinetic energy of the jet reconciles the observed energy budget with the expected accretion rate .",
    "if a relativistic jet is present , synchrotron radio emission is also expected .",
    "the `` fundamental - plane '' relation ( merloni , heinz , & di matteo 2003 ) between the observed radio luminosities , x - ray luminosities , and bh masses supports the hypothesis that inactive smbhs have low accretion rates as well as low radiative efficiency ( @xmath17 ) , and that most of the accretion power is carried outwards by a steady jet .",
    "however , in other cases ( e.g. , ngc821 : fabbiano et al .",
    "2004 ) it is more likely that the accretion power is released in intermittent , short - lived outbursts ( binney & tabor 1995 ; ciotti & ostriker 2001 ; jones et al .  2002",
    "; omma et al .",
    "2004 ) ; if that is the case , the relative fraction of smbhs observed in an active or quiescent state would depend on the duration of the duty cycle .",
    "alternatively , in a few cases the x - ray emission from the smbh may be absorbed by dust ( often found in the inner @xmath18 pc of elliptical galaxies : rest et al .",
    "2001 ) and re - emitted in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "finally , it is still possible that a few luminous elliptical galaxies with partially depleted stellar cores may not have large gas supplies to feed the smbh .",
    "determining which of these physical processes are at play in quiescent smbhs will also help us understand and quantify the smbh feedback onto its host galaxy . for a sample of 18 nearby galaxies with nuclear x - ray luminosity @xmath19 and bondi mass accretion rate of hot gas estimated from _",
    "data , pellegrini ( 2005 ) found that @xmath19 can vary by orders of magnitude and shows a large scatter when plotted against bh mass or bondi rate . while in some cases the observed luminosities are consistent with the prediction of advective models , for other nuclear sources the observed luminosities are much lower , and therefore scenarios including outflows or convection are needed . a scenario with feedback from accretion on the surrounding gas",
    "was considered the most promising .      to test these scenarios , we chose a further sample of _ six nearby , quiescent elliptical galaxies _ with direct smbh mass determinations , from gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and kormendy et al .",
    "stringent upper limits on agn activity exist for all these smbhs , from radio , optical ( balmer emission lines ) , and previous x - ray studies ( ho 2002 ) , and from a lack of uv bumps .",
    "our goal is to explore the most extreme cases of sub - eddington nuclear activity , so we only focused on galaxies with smbh masses @xmath20 and x - ray luminosity @xmath21 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we also excluded galaxies more distant than 30 mpc .    in five of the six galaxies ,",
    "the smbh mass has been accurately determined with three - integral models ( gebhardt et al .",
    "the only exception is ngc4486b , whose mass estimate was based on two - integral models ( kormendy et al .",
    "1997 ) and is therefore much more uncertain .",
    "for example , a revised error range in kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) allows for masses between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a mass @xmath24 was quoted as a preliminary result of an ongoing study by gebhardt ( 2005 , priv .",
    "comm . ) . as a corollary of our study",
    ", we have obtained an alternative ( indirect ) smbh mass determination for ngc4486b ( soria et al .",
    "2005 = paper ii ) , using the @xmath25velocity dispersion ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) and @xmath25srsic index ( graham et al .  2003 , 2005 in prep . ) relations .",
    "we are aware that the larger mass uncertainty , and its peculiar morphological type , make ngc4486b somewhat different from the rest of our _ chandra _ targets , among which it was included for historical reasons .",
    "classified as a compact elliptical ( ce ) galaxy , ngc4486b may have originated as the bulge of a much larger , tidally stripped disk galaxy ( jerjen & binggeli 1997 ; see also graham 2002 ) .",
    "our main objective is to _ determine the energy and mass budget _ for the nuclear regions of our sample galaxies , and for a few others for which smbh mass and luminosity are available in the literature .",
    "we want to answer three fundamental questions : how much gas is available for accretion ?",
    "how much energy is radiated by the smbh ? where does the rest of the mass and energy go ? moreover , this may also help to explain why most of the smbhs in the local universe are very faint or quiescent .",
    "we begin by using _",
    "chandra _ data to investigate the spatial and spectral properties of the nuclear x - ray emission . by comparing the observed x - ray luminosity of the smbh with the temperature and density of the surrounding gas",
    ", we can constrain some of the accretion parameters . in particular ,",
    "if we could precisely determine the mass accretion rate onto the smbh , we would find the efficiency .",
    "however , a direct measurement of the accretion rate is still beyond today s observational capabilities , given the characteristic size of smbh event horizons ( @xmath26 pc ) .",
    "so , we need to turn the problem around .",
    "we shall use model predictions for the radiative and non - radiative efficiency ( e.g. , standard disks , or advective accretion ) and compare them with the observed luminosity and gas density available inside the smbh accretion radii ( characteristic size @xmath27 pc ) . from this , we will infer what fraction of the gas available is really accreted . in paper",
    "i , we shall use _ chandra _ to estimate the hot gas component to the accretion flow ; we shall look for correlations between the classical bondi inflow rate from the hot ism , and the observed smbh luminosity . in paper ii , we shall use optical data to determine whether additional sources of fuel ( e.g. , warm gas from stellar winds ) may have been missed by the x - ray study .",
    "we shall then discuss the correlation between the total gas accretion rate and the observed smbh luminosities .",
    "finally , we shall discuss how to balance the mass and energy budget , taking into account total gas injection , accretion onto the smbh , and outflows .",

    "some smbhs , including those in the six galaxies of our sample , tend to be more x - ray luminous than predicted by the standard adaf model ( i.e. , they lie above the predicted @xmath460 adaf line in figure 14 ) .",

    "as an aside , we note that the lack of smbhs in the bottom left of the diagram ( i.e. , with @xmath475 and @xmath476 ) may be partly due to a selection effect , because both the nuclear point - like source and the diffuse hot - ism emission would be close to or below the _ chandra _ detection limit in those galaxies .",
    "the original adaf solution has subsequently been developed by taking into account two physical effects that are likely to further reduce the accretion rate , so that @xmath477 ( see narayan 2002 and references therein , for a review ) .",
    "firstly , the inflowing gas is likely to become convectively unstable due to its inefficient cooling ( convection dominated accretion flow , cdaf : narayan et al .",
    "2000 ) ; convective instabilities are also likely to occur when a magnetic field is frozen into the infalling gas ( igumenshchev & narayan 2002 ) ; or when the inflowing gas has a large angular momentum ( proga & begelman 2003 ) or vorticity ( krumholz , mckee & klein  2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "secondly , inefficient cooling causes the gas to have positive bernoulli parameter , thus triggering large - scale winds and outflows which reduce the amount of gas reaching the bh ( advection dominated inflow - outflow solutions , adios : blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "low , adaf - like efficiencies _ and _ a reduced accretion rate with respect to the bondi rate ( @xmath478@xmath479 ) , via cdaf and/or adios solutions , is a possible explanation for those galaxies in which hot - gas densities are @xmath480@xmath49 @xmath7 , and correspondingly , @xmath481 .",
    "they lie below the standard adaf line in figure 14 . among them ,",
    "the smbh in the milky way , for which @xmath482 ; an accretion rate @xmath483 has been suggested ( quataert 2003 ) .",
    "the smbh in the nucleus of m31 also belongs to this group ( garcia et al .",
    "2005 ) . at higher central gas densities",
    "( @xmath484 @xmath7 , corresponding to @xmath485 ) , theoretical and observational arguments show that accretion will become radiatively efficient , with the formation of a standard , optically - thick , geometrically - thin accretion disk .",
    "smbhs in this regime will appear as fully - fledged agn .",
    "we have assumed so far that the accretion rate can be expressed as a constant fraction of the gas available .",
    "we also need to take into account the possibility that accretion is intermittent , so that the system may go through phases when the smbh accretion rate is much lower than the bondi inflow rate , and subsequent phases in which it can be much higher .",
    "the nuclear region would alternatively build up or be depleted of gas .    in one version of this scenario , it is the feedback from the nuclear x - ray source that drives and self - regulates the activity cycles :",
    "when the nuclear source is active , the surrounding ism is radiatively heated ( ciotti & ostriker 2001 ; ostriker & ciotti 2005 ) , or , in the case of radiatively - inefficient accretion , is heated by the bulk kinetic energy of jets , outflows or convective motions ( binney & tabor 1995 ; omma et al .",
    "2004 ) , until the radial inflow is stopped and the nucleus switches off .",
    "thus , the bondi inflow estimated from the gas density at large radii ( at the limit of the _ chandra _ resolution ) may not provide a good indication for the time - dependent accretion rate and smbh luminosity .",
    "this is a possible explanation for the observed lack of any relation between @xmath19 , @xmath25 and @xmath376 ( pellegrini 2005 ) .",
    "alternatively , accretion may cycle between radiatively inefficient flows ( e.g. , cdaf ) in which gas accumulates inside the accretion radius , and a standard , radiatively - efficient accretion disk in which the stored gas is quickly accreted into the bh .",
    "however , this transition should only happen at accretion rates @xmath486 , much higher than estimated in our target galaxies",
    ".    intermittent accretion may also be due to thermal - viscous ionization instabilities , triggered by an ionization front propagating inwards or outwards across an accretion disk ( siemiginowska , czerny & kostyunin 1996 ) ; a change of the viscosity parameter by a factor of @xmath487 between the two states may lead to changes in luminosity by four order of magnitudes .",
    "again , this scenario requires that the inflowing gas can cool efficiently to form an accretion disk .",
    "it was suggested ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2004 ) that intermittent ejections may be responsible for the knotty jet - like feature in the nuclear region of ngc821 .",
    "if this emission is connected with nuclear activity , the most likely explanation would be that of thermal emission from shocks in the hot ism resulting from a past nuclear outburst .",
    "we have used _ chandra _ , supported by archival _ hst _ and ground - based optical images , to study the nature , accretion power and mass budget of x - ray - faint smbhs in elliptical / s0 galaxies . for this purpose ,",
    "we have chosen a sample of six nearby galaxies with quiescent smbhs , five of which with accurate bh mass determinations ( from stellar kinematics ) . from the x - ray images",
    ", we found different morphologies for the x - ray emission in the nuclear region . in ngc821 ,",
    "a jet - like feature has been previously suggested ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2004 ) . in ngc4697 ,",
    "the nuclear emission is resolved into a few point - like sources ( one of which is coincident with the nucleus ) . in other cases , ( ngc3377 , ngc4564 , ngc5845 )",
    "the nuclear emission is extended on scales of a few hundred pc but its morphology remains unclear .",
    "obscuration of the nuclear source may play a role in some cases ; for example , in at least one galaxy ( ngc5845 ) , the smbh may be partly obscured by an edge - on disk of dust and stars , and the observed extended x - ray emission may be due to scattering in the surrounding plasma above and below the disk plane .    in five of the six galaxies ,",
    "the x - ray colors of the nuclear emission are hard , consistent with an agn spectrum .",
    "hence , it is likely that most of the nuclear emission comes from the accreting smbh , rather than from a central concentration of hot gas .",
    "in addition , softer x - ray emission from diffuse hot gas is detected around the nuclear region , out to @xmath331 kpc .",
    "we have fitted the soft x - ray brightness profiles with @xmath307 models to estimate central hot gas densities ( typical values are @xmath488 @xmath7 ) . for two of our galaxies ,",
    "the flux from the diffuse component is high enough to allow also for spectral fitting .",
    "ngc4486b is the only case where the central , point - like x - ray source is soft but there is no evidence of diffuse thermal emission around it .",
    "the bondi accretion rate gives an estimate of the rate at which diffuse hot gas flows into the sphere of influence of the smbh ( characteristic radius @xmath489 pc @xmath490 ) .",
    "typical bondi inflow rates vary from @xmath340 a few @xmath491 to @xmath492 yr@xmath2 in our target galaxies this is a lower limit to the gas injection rate into the sphere of influence , because it does not take into account additional gas sources directly inside @xmath338 ( for example , stellar winds or gas losses from type - ia supernovae ) .",
    "based on the x - ray data , we tried to answer the following ( inter - related ) questions : whether the observed x - ray smbh luminosities are consistent with standard or radiatively - inefficient accretion ; whether the x - ray - inferred bondi rate is a good estimate of the true accretion rate onto the smbh ; and whether there is a correlation between bondi rate and x - ray luminosity of the smbh .",
    "we found that standard accretion is ruled out for all galaxies , as it would overestimate the smbh luminosities . on the other hand ,",
    "our quiescent sample of smbhs are also brighter than what is predicted by radiatively - inefficient solutions ( adaf , adios , cdaf ) ; we interpret this as evidence that the bondi inflow rate of the hot ism underestimates the total gas injection rate into the sphere of influence of the smbh .",
    "however , when we consider the other x - ray faint smbhs for which the nuclear luminosity and the bondi rate are known from the literature , we see that most of them are consistent with , or fainter than predicted by the adaf model ( as noted in pellegrini 2005 ) . in those cases",
    ", it appears that the bondi inflow rate of hot gas is an over - estimate of the true accretion rate .",
    "overall , there seems to be no correlation between the bondi rate and the x - ray luminosity of the smbh .",
    "a possible explanation suggested ( pellegrini 2005 ) for this lack of correlation is that accretion is intermittent , self - regulated by feedback from the bh : it may switch between a state in which @xmath477 ( when gas builds up in the inner few pc ) , and one in which @xmath493 ( as it is depleted ) . in paper",
    "ii we will use optical observations to investigate additional sources of fuel for the smbh ; this will provide a better estimate of the total accretion rate , and will allow us to re - analyze its correlation with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "we shall then be able to estimate the energy and mass budget , discuss the conditions for a steady - state , and distinguish between different varieties of radiatively - inefficient models .",

    "<S> we have studied the nuclear activity in a sample of six quiescent early - type galaxies , with new _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _ data and archival _ hst _ optical images . </S>",
    "<S> their nuclear sources have x - ray luminosities @xmath0@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) , and colors or spectra consistent with accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs)except for the nucleus of ngc4486b , which is softer than typical agn spectra . in a few cases </S>",
    "<S> , the x - ray morphology of the nuclear sources shows hints of marginally extended structures , in addition to the surrounding diffuse thermal emission from hot gas , which is detectable on scales @xmath5 kpc . in one case ( ngc5845 ) , a dusty disk may partially obstruct our direct view of the smbh . </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the temperature and density of the hot interstellar medium , which is one major source of fuel for the accreting smbh ; typical central densities are @xmath6 @xmath7 . assuming that the hot gas is captured by the smbh at the bondi rate , we show that the observed x - ray luminosities are too faint to be consistent with standard disk accretion , but brighter than predicted by radiatively - inefficient solutions ( e.g. , advection - dominated acretion flows , adaf ) . in total , there are @xmath8 galaxies for which smbh mass , hot gas density , and nuclear x - ray luminosity are simultaneously known . in some cases , the nuclear sources are brighter than predicted by the adaf model ; in other cases , they are consistent or fainter . we discuss the apparent lack of correlations between bondi rate and x - ray luminosity , and suggest that , in order to understand the observed distribution , we need to know two additional parameters : the amount of gas supplied by the stellar population inside the accretion radius , and the fraction ( possibly @xmath9 ) of the total gas available that is accreted by the smbh . </S>",
    "<S> we leave a detailed study of these issues to a subsequent paper . </S>"
