    "axially symmetric solutions of einstein field equations corresponding to disklike configurations of matter are of great astrophysical interest and have been extensively studied .",
    "these solutions can be static or stationary and with or without radial pressure .",
    "solutions for static disks without radial pressure were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , and morgan and morgan @xcite , and with radial pressure by morgan and morgan @xcite , and , in connection with gravitational collapse , by chamorro , gregory and stewart @xcite .",
    "static disks with radial tension may also be of interest and , although their relevance in astrophysics is limited , these solutions can be studied as possible sources of exact solutions for axially symmetric static problems .",
    "static thin disks without radial stress generate a weyl spacetime .",
    "then they are described by two different metric functions @xcite .",
    "the stability of these models can be explained by either assuming the existence of hoop stresses or that the particles on the disk plane move under the action of their own gravitational field in such a way that as many particles move clockwise as counterclockwise .",
    "this last interpretation is frequently made since it can be invoked to mimic true rotational effects .",
    "a large class of statics thin disks solutions were obtained by letelier and oliveira @xcite using the inverse scattering method .",
    "solutions for self - similar static disks were analyzed by lynden - bell and pineault @xcite , and lemos @xcite .",
    "the superposition of static disks with black holes were considered by lemos and letelier @xcite , and klein @xcite .",
    "recently bick , lynden - bell and katz @xcite studied static disks as sources of known vacuum spacetimes and bick , lynden - bell and pichon @xcite found an infinity number of new static solutions .",
    "static disks with radial stress are described by three metric functions so presenting some degree of complexity and , despite its clear relevance , has been seldom treated in the literature .",
    "the fact that the additional metric function can be considered as the real part of an analytic function will be the main ingredient of our method to introduce radial stress .",
    "static disks with radial stress can also be obtained in other ways .",
    "lemos @xcite studied self - similar static disks working in spherical polar coordinates and using self - similarity to reduce the einstein field equations to an ordinary differential equation .",
    "recently , pichon and lynden - bell @xcite obtained static disks by making a cut through a weyl solution above all singularities or sources .",
    "the identification of this solution with its mirror image yields disks with radial stress .    in this work we consider static non - rotating thin disks of finite radius with nonzero radial stress .",
    "to obtain a well behaved radial stress we find an analytical function compatible with the boundary conditions imposed on the additional metric function by the requirement that the solution be singularity - free outside the disk .",
    "we find a general expression for the radial stress that can be written in terms of a square root in such away that by choosing a sign solutions with radial pressure and solutions with radial tension can be obtained .",
    "when we take the positive ( negative ) sign of the square root , the stress is positive ( negative ) and so we will have disks solutions with radial pressure ( tension ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present the principal aspects of static thin disks solutions with radial stress , the expression for the energy - momentum tensor of the disk and the general solution that leads to disks with radial pressure or with radial tension . in sec .",
    "3 we study solutions with radial pressure . in sec .",
    "4 solutions with radial tension are considered .",
    "we conclude , in sec . 5 , by summaring our main results .",

    "we will comeback to this point later .",
    "the reflectional symmetry of ( [ eq : lap ] ) - ( [ eq : eq ] ) with respect to the plane @xmath9 allows us to assume that @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are even functions of @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are continuous across the disk and vanish at infinity , where @xmath150 .",
    "the metric tensor in weyl coordinates is given by @xmath151 expressions in the original coordinates are obtained using ( [ eq : rab ] ) , ( [ eq : zab ] ) , and ( [ eq : com2 ] ) .    taking the values of the above expressions at the disk and using ( [ eq : emt1 ] ) - ( [ eq : emt3 ] )",
    "we compute the energy density and pressures , @xmath152 , \\label{eq : te1 } \\\\ &      &    \\nonumber \\\\ & p_{\\varphi } & = - p_{r } \\left[8 \\gamma^2      r^2 - 9 \\gamma^2 r^4 - 1 \\right ] , \\label{eq : te2 } \\\\ &        &      \\nonumber \\\\ & p_{r } & = - p_0 \\ exp \\left\\{(3 + 4 \\gamma)\\gamma      r^2 - 4.5 \\gamma^2 r^4\\right\\ } \\sqrt{1 - r^2 } , \\label{eq : te3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is a positive constant and @xmath10 .",
    "from ( [ eq : te1 ] ) we can see that the weak energy condition is equivalent to @xmath153 for @xmath10 .",
    "this expression have two zeros at @xmath154 and so there are three different classes of solutions corresponding to the values of @xmath69 such that the above equation have either two , one or any real positive root .    when @xmath155 there is a solution @xmath156 of ( [ eq : r02 ] ) in such away that the disks have central regions with @xmath59 and border regions with @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath157 we can see that @xmath74 everywhere on the disks , accordingly the weak energy condition is satisfied . finally , when @xmath158 , there are two different real positive solutions of ( [ eq : r02 ] ) , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , so that the disks have a central region with @xmath77 , when @xmath161 , a region with @xmath59 , when @xmath162 , and a region with @xmath77 , when @xmath163 .    from ( [ eq : te1 ] ) - ( [ eq : te3 ] ) we can see that @xmath164 hence @xmath147 at @xmath165 .",
    "accordingly , the solutions are in agree with the strong energy condition only in a region , the central region of the disks when @xmath166 , or the border region of the disks when @xmath167 .",
    "we also see from ( [ eq : te2 ] ) that the azimuthal stress is zero at @xmath168 when @xmath169 there are two different positive roots , @xmath170 .",
    "hence there is a region of the disks where the azimuthal stress is positive , for @xmath171 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath172 the azimuthal stress is negative everywhere .    in order to show the behavior of the different classes of solutions that can be obtained we consider some particular values of @xmath69 . in figure 4",
    " 7 we plot the functions @xmath88 , @xmath50 , @xmath89 and @xmath87 in the interval @xmath10 for @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath81 , respectively , in @xmath73 units .",
    "we see that very different classes of solutions can be obtained , some of them with either the center of the disk or the border in accord with the energy conditions .",
    "in this work a method was presented which can be used to obtain static thin disks models with a well behaved nonzero radial stress .",
    "the general expression that was obtained for the radial stress admits solutions with positive stress , representing disks with radial pressure support , and solutions with negative stress , representing disks with radial tension support .",
    "is easy to shown that , with the simple solution ( [ eq : wab ] ) , when we consider solutions with positive stress is not possible to fulfill all the energy conditions at the entire disk , whereas that with negative stress we can obtain solutions that satisfy all the energy conditions everywhere on the disks , as the first solution studied at sec .",
    "the method that was described can be used to obtain many static disks solutions with a radial pressure support that presents a very reasonable physical behavior and perhaps , by considering another more involved solutions of the laplace equation ( [ eq : lap ] ) , the solution can be adjusted to fulfill the weak and strong energy conditions everywhere on the disks , leading so to a physically acceptable source which would produce the considered vacuum solutions .",
    "also , as we will do in a future paper , the method can be extended to consider rotating thin disks , which have a stronger astrophysical interest .",
