    "this paper intends to provide an overview of recent work focusing on the photospheric emission in relativistic outflows .",
    "such emission emerges when relativistically expanding plasma becomes transparent to photons .",
    "it is particularly relevant in the context of fireball ( see e.g. , ref .  ) and fireshell ( see e.g. , ref .  ) models of cosmic gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "this topic was discussed extensively during the thirteenth marcel grossmann meeting in stockholm in 2012 , where a special parallel session grb1 : photospheric emission in grbs took place . in addition",
    "some very recent progress on this topic will be discussed .",
    "gamma ray bursts are transient flashes of gamma radiation with duration ranging from several milliseconds up to thousands of seconds .",
    "they are characterized by strong variability down to a millisecond time scale of observed flux .",
    "observed spectra are nonthermal , and when integrated over time they are well fit by the phenomenological band model @xcite which can be thought of in terms of the @xmath0 diagram , where @xmath1 is the net energy flux and @xmath2 is the frequency , as two power laws smoothly joined at the peak .",
    "recent observations , mostly by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite , indicate that time resolved spectra have a more complex shape than a simple band one . in particular , additional power law and black body components are required to obtain satisfactory fits @xcite .",
    "the presence of a black body component in observed spectrum @xcite is of great importance , since it points unambiguously towards the transition from an optically thick regime to an optically thin one .",
    "such a transition has long been expected in theoretical models of grbs @xcite .",
    "gamma ray burst sources are assumed to be optically thick with a typical optical depth on the order of @xmath3 , see e.g. , ref .  .",
    "an electron - positron plasma generated in the source and loaded with baryons is expanding due to its radiative pressure . at some distance from the source",
    "the optical depth for compton scattering decreases to unity and most of the radiation trapped in the plasma gets released .",
    "the radial distance from the source at which this transparency occurs is referred to as the photospheric radius .",
    "the simplest spherically symmetric models of photospheric emission predict the shape of the spectrum to be nearly a black body one @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the observed spectra in grbs look nonthermal , being significantly broader than the planck one . since such simple photospheric models are at odds with the observations , attention was turned to optically thin models of emission in grbs .",
    "however , optically thin models , in particular the ones based on synchrotron emission , were found to contradict observations as well @xcite .    generally speaking , there are two effects which lead to the broadening of the observed spectrum of photospheric emission with respect to the black body shape , referred to as geometrical  and physical  broadening , respectively @xcite .",
    "geometrical  broadening of the spectrum occurs for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the photosphere is not a sharp surface , but is a region in space and time characterized by a probability for photons to be scattered by electrons for the last time @xcite : this is an analog of the last scattering surface in cosmology , see e.g. , ref .  .",
    "secondly , the emission arriving at an observer with a given arrival time originates from different parts of the outflow , with different radial coordinain what follows we adopt thetes and angles . hence the observed spectrum represents a superposition of spectra produced at these different parts of the outflow .",
    "physical  broadening results if dissipation of a part of the kinetic ( or electromagnetic ) energy into thermal energy occurs before the plasma becomes transparent .",
    "such dissipation may happen due to several reasons : magnetic reconnection , inelastic nuclear collisions @xcite and shocks @xcite .",
    "the generic dissipative photospheric model is based on a simple idea : if the temperature of electrons is not equal to the temperature of photons , compton scattering produces distortions of the photon spectrum compared to the planck spectrum .",
    "photospheric models with dissipation are mostly concerned with the part of the spectrum with energies higher than the peak energy . however , also the low energy part of the spectrum may be modified due to compton scattering , see ref .  .",
    "one has to bear in mind that the detection of photospheric components in grbs provides unique information on the physical characteristics of the outflow , and consequently on the properties of the source .",
    "in particular , constraints on the lorentz factor of the outflow @xcite and on the radius at the base of the outflow @xcite may be obtained .    in what follows",
    "we discuss various aspects of photospheric models in grbs , with particular emphasis on physical effects and implications for observations . in section 2 the optical depth and the photospheric radius",
    "are introduced . in section 3 radiative diffusion from relativistically expanding outflow",
    "is discussed .",
    "section 4 considers the probability density of the last scattering of photons .",
    "section 5 discusses the average number of scatterings in a finite relativistic outflow . in section 6 the difference between the laboratory and arrival time pictures of the photosphere",
    "is illustrated . in section 7 various methods for computation of observed light curves and spectra of the photospheric emission",
    "are presented .",
    "section 8 gives a brief discussion of dissipative models of the photospheric emission .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow .",
    "we start from the definition of the key quantity :  the _ photospheric radius_. recall that the optical depth along the light - like world line @xmath4 is defined as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6  is the cross section , @xmath7 is the 4-current of particles , and @xmath8 is the coordinate length element of the world line .    consider a spherically symmetric outflow with finite spatial extension expanding with ultrarelativistic velocity .",
    "take a light - like world line starting at time @xmath9 at the interior boundary @xmath10 of the outflow and directed outwards .",
    "the optical depth given by equation ( [ tauwl ] ) is then ( see e.g. , ref .  ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is radial coordinate and @xmath13 is the angle between the line of sight and photon trajectory , @xmath14 , @xmath12 is used as a parameter along the world line , @xmath15 is the radial coordinate at which the world line crosses the outer boundary of the outflow , and @xmath16 is the number density of electrons measured in the laboratory reference frame ( in which the source of the outflow is at rest ) .",
    "if positrons are also present in the outflow , their contribution must also be added .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is found from the equation of motion of the outflow .    for the computation of the optical depth in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) one has to know density of electrons and lorentz factor profiles along the light - like world line .",
    "these quantities can be inferred , e.g. , from relativistic hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "alternatively , one can assume certain profiles .",
    "in some cases the integral ( [ tau ] ) can be computed analytically :  in particular this is the case for a steady relativistic wind . in what follows",
    "we adopt the model of a relativistic wind of finite duration with the radius @xmath18 at the radial position where the outflow originates ( the base of the outflow ) , luminosity @xmath19 , mass ejection rate @xmath20 and laboratory width of the outflow @xmath21 , see e.g. , ref .  .",

    "recently a new classification of finite duration outflows with respect to photospheric emission has been proposed @xcite .",
    "namely :    * * photon thick outflows * , where along the light - like world line connecting the origin and the observer , the number density in the outflow decreases significantly . in this respect",
    "the outflow is a long wind , even if the laboratory thickness of the outflow may be small . * * photon thin outflows * , where the number density of the outflow does not change substantially along this light - like world line . in this respect",
    "the outflow is a thin shell  even if the duration of the explosion producing the plasma could be long .",
    "for instance , a geometrically thin ultrarelativistically expanding shell may be both thin or thick with respect to the photons propagating inside it :  hence the origin of the term .    for completeness",
    "consider also the case when the number density of positrons exceeds the number density of baryons .",
    "note that the electron - positron plasma in a grb source ( also in the presence of baryons ) reaches thermal equilibrium before expansion @xcite and it remains accelerating until it becomes transparent to radiation .",
    "due to the exponential dependence of the thermal pair density on the temperature @xmath41 , measured in the reference frame comoving with the outflow , and hence on the radial coordinate , transparency is reached at @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath44 is the electron mass , rather independent of initial conditions .",
    "given the initial temperature @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and the adiabaticity of expansion with @xmath47 ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , we find @xmath48    there is a discussion in ref .   which shows that even if these results were partially known , such a new classification improves our physical understanding of finite outflows with respect to the photospheric emission .",
    "in particular , it becomes clear that all asymptotic expressions ( [ rph ] ) are relevant within both fireball and fireshell models .",
    "all these results are derived assuming a constant lorentz factor across the outflow .",
    "hence the width of the shell remains constant during its expansion .",
    "however , analytical ( refs .  ) and numerical ( refs .  )",
    "hydrodynamic calculations show that a lorentz factor gradient develops during the expansion of the outflow .",
    "this leads to its spreading at sufficiently large radii in the coasting phase .",
    "recently such hydrodynamic spreading was considered in ref .  .",
    "in the coasting phase of expansion each differential shell within the outflow is expanding with almost constant speed @xmath49 , so the spreading is determined by the radial dependence of the lorentz factor @xmath50 . in a variable outflow",
    "there can be regions with @xmath50 decreasing with radius and @xmath50 increasing with radius . at sufficiently large radii only the regions with increasing @xmath51 contribute to the spreading .    from the equations of motion of the external and internal boundaries of this region we obtain @xcite the thickness of the region as a function of the radial position of the region @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the lorentz factors at the external and internal boundaries ,",
    "@xmath21 is the width of the region at small @xmath55 , and @xmath55 is the radial position of the inner boundary .",
    "consider such a region in the two limiting cases : when the relative lorentz factor difference is strong , namely @xmath56 , and when the relative lorentz factor difference is weak , namely @xmath57 .    in the former case the second term in parenthesis in equation  ( [ lr ] ) can be neglected , and we obtain that the spreading becomes efficient at @xmath58 , see refs .   and . in the latter case",
    "we find the corresponding critical radius of hydrodynamic spreading @xmath59 . from eq .",
    "( [ lr ] ) one can see that in both cases for @xmath60 , the width of the outflow is increasing linearly with radius @xmath61 .    hence the definition of the photospheric radius given above in eq .",
    "( [ rph ] ) corresponds to the case of a weak lorentz factor difference with @xmath62 .",
    "consider now the case of a strong relative lorentz factor difference across the outflow .",

    "the internal boundary of the element is moving with velocity @xmath64 , and the external one is moving with velocity @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the differential thickness at some fixed laboratory time @xmath67 and the derivative @xmath68 is taken at the same laboratory time .",
    "then at time @xmath9 the width of the element is @xmath69 , its radial position is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the initial radial position of the element , and the corresponding laboratory density is @xmath72 where @xmath73 . in order to compute the integral ( [ tau ] ) one needs to find the expression for the baryonic number density along the light - like world line .",
    "taking into account hydrodynamical spreading ( [ lr ] ) one obtains @xmath74 which is exact in the ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "an estimate for @xmath75 can be given for a strong relative lorentz factor difference @xmath76 in the outflow @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the distance inside the outflow along the light - like world line .",
    "integrating expression  ( [ dgdr ] ) the lorentz factor dependence on the radial coordinate along this light - like world line is obtained @xmath79 since we are interested in the asymptotics when hydrodynamic spreading is essential , one can assume that @xmath80 in the integral ( [ tau ] ) , which is equivalent to @xmath81 .  under this condition the integral can be performed analytically and the photospheric radius is obtained as @xmath82 this result coincides with the last line in eq .",
    "( [ rph ] ) up to a numerical factor .",
    "however , its physical meaning is different : it represents the photon thick asymptotics of eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) , since @xmath83 .    formulas ( [ rph ] ) , ( [ rtrepwind ] ) and ( [ tauspreading ] ) represent asymptotic expressions for the photospheric radius in different physical situations relevant for grbs .",
    "these results are obtained within the simple model of relativistic wind with finite duration , while the last expression accounts also for radial spreading of the outflow .",
    "it is essential that these equations are supplied with the corresponding ranges of validity . in realistic cases with hydrodynamic profiles obtained by",
    "e.g. , numerical simulations , one has to perform numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) with @xmath37 and find the photospheric radius by equating the value obtained by such an integration to unity .",
    "similarly , the shape of the photosphere can be recovered by equating the integral ( [ tau ] ) to unity without requiring @xmath37 .",
    "in such a case one obtains a surface @xmath84 .",
    "the shape of this surface at a given laboratory time is far from being a sphere : it is concave for photon thick outflows and convex for photon thin ones .",

    "the surfaces ( [ photosphereinfwindcoasting ] ) and ( [ shellphotosphere ] ) give the position of the corresponding photon thick and photon thin outflow photospheres with very good accuracy .",
    "the definition of the photosphere implies that at this position in space the outflow as a whole becomes transparent to radiation .",
    "however , emission emerges from the outflow when it is optically thick as well .",
    "such emission is due to radiative diffusion which transfers the energy from deeper parts of the outflow towards its surface .",
    "naively one can think that such an effect is negligible in ultrarelativistic outflows .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "this effect , usually neglected in the literature based on considerations of steady winds , plays a crucial role in photon thin outflows @xcite . actually , near the photosphere",
    ", photons are not produced in the outflow since three - particle interactions such as bremsstrahlung and double compton scattering become inefficient ( freeze out ) at smaller radii . hence photons may diffuse from the interior of the outflow to the boundary and eventually escape before the outflow reaches the photospheric radius . in such a case there will be no emission at the photospheric radius , since most photons have already escaped .",
    "this is exactly the case for photon thin outflows , as we will see below .",
    "consider the diffusion crossing time on which a photon is expected to cross the outflow with comoving radial thickness @xmath90 .",
    "this time is given by @xmath91 , where the diffusion coefficient is @xmath92 and @xmath93 and @xmath94  are the comoving mean free path of photons and the comoving electron number density , respectively .",
    "one may find the radial position @xmath95 at which the outflow arrives by the time @xmath96 . at this time , measured from the beginning of the expansion , photons actually cross the entire width of the outflow by diffusion .",
    "neglecting the initial brief acceleration phase when diffusion is irrelevant , from the equation of motion of the outflow @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is time measured in comoving frame , and taking into account eq .",
    "( [ tau0 ] ) we obtain @xmath99 this diffusion radius should be compared to the photospheric radius ( [ rph ] ) . from the last line in eq .",
    "( [ rph ] ) one finds@xmath100 which is valid for any acceleration model of the outflow .    for photon thick outflows one has @xmath101 and",
    "the diffusion radius is always larger than the photospheric radius . in other words ,",
    "the width of the outflow is so large that photons have no time to diffuse out by the moment the outflow becomes transparent .",
    "hence diffusion is irrelevant for photon thick outflows .",
    "the situation is the opposite for photon thin outflows , when @xmath102 and the diffusion radius is always smaller than the photospheric radius .",
    "this implies that in photon thin outflows radiation decouples not at the photospheric radius , defined by eq .",
    "( [ rph ] ) , but at the diffusion radius defined by eq .",
    "( [ diffradius ] ) , when the expanding plasma is still opaque . in this sense",
    "the characteristic radius of the photospheric emission from photon thin outflows is the diffusion radius .",
    "one has to keep in mind that photons decouple from the plasma not only at a surface given for photon thick outflows by the condition @xmath103 .",
    "the last scattering of photons occurs in a finite region of spacetime near this surface .",
    "hence the photosphere is not a sharp surface , but it is  fuzzy \" @xcite . since the outflow is dynamical and finite in spatial extension , the finiteness effects are expected to play an important role for the formation of the photospheric emission .",
    "such effects have been recently investigated @xcite by means of monte carlo simulations using the model of a relativistic wind with finite duration and considering both coherent and compton scattering of photons .",

    "these results have important implications in dissipative models of grbs where either kinetic or electromagnetic energy gets converted into thermal energy of the outflow when it is still optically thick .",
    "they imply in particular that in contrast with a static medium , in a relativistically moving medium the spectral distortion is harder to achieve , since the number of scatterings is less in the latter case .",
    "once the photospheric radius ( or diffusion radius ) is known such averaged properties of the photospheric emission as the peak energy in the observed spectrum and the duration of emission can be determined . in order to know the detailed light curve and time resolved spectra one has to define the notion of a dynamic photosphere .",

    "given the hydrodynamic profiles of the number density of electrons @xmath140 and the lorentz factor @xmath141 of the spherically symmetric outflow , one can compute the optical depth and find the surface corresponding to the condition @xmath137 .",
    "for the simplest case of a relativistic wind with finite duration there is only one such surface at a given laboratory time @xmath9 . in general , however , for a single peaked density profile there are two surfaces :  the outer photosphere and the inner one , see e.g. , ref .  .",
    "the inner photosphere appears because of two opposite effects :  the increase of density with decreasing depth , and the decrease of density due to expansion . for the outer photosphere",
    "both effects work in the same direction .",
    "the distant observer , however , can see only one photosphere at a given arrival time , namely the phe surface . for a single peaked density profile the light curve seen by",
    "this observer will be also single peaked .",
    "emission originating from the outer photosphere arrives first .",
    "the peak in the light curve corresponds roughly to emission from the peak in the laboratory density profile .",
    "emission from the inner photosphere arrives in the tail of the light curve .    for more complex hydrodynamic profiles with multiple peaks in the electron number density",
    ", multiple photospheres may appear , which may result in a spiky light curve of the photospheric emission with a variable time scale down to @xmath142 , i.e. , milliseconds @xcite . in this respect observations",
    "may be used for reconstruction of the underlying hydrodynamic profiles , see ref .  .",
    "in addition , departure from spherical symmetry manifested in the appearance of an angular dependence of hydrodynamic quantities , in particular of the bulk lorentz factor , is also crucial for the formation of observed spectra of photospheric emission @xcite .",
    "several methods of computing the spectra and light curves of photospheric emission as seen by a distant observer have been proposed , in particular : integration over the phe surface @xcite ; integration over volume with attenuation factors @xcite ; approximations to the radiative transfer @xcite ; monte carlo simulations of photon scattering @xcite ; fokker - planck approximation to the collision integral with an anisotropic photon field ( generalized kompaneets equation ) @xcite and relativistic boltzmann equations @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that several very different methods produce practically the same results , see fig .",
    "[ photonthick ] .",
    "all these results indicate that the photospheric spectrum is wider than the planck one .",
    "there is an increase in the low energy slope of the spectrum , resulting in the photon index @xmath143 , in contrast with the planck photon index @xmath144 .",
    "the computation method based on the _ radiative transfer equation _ turns out to be useful since it represents a second step beyond the simplest approach adopted by goodman @xcite .",
    "in fact , for estimating the observed spectrum goodman used superpositions of planck spectra corresponding to different emitting regions with temperatures obtained from hydrodynamic equations .",
    "in approximate solutions of the radiative transfer equations using  fuzzy photosphere \" and  sharp photosphere \" approximations @xcite the spectrum coming from a given region no longer has the planck shape , although the source function in the comoving frame is still assumed to be isotropic and thermal .",
    "even if the approximations adopted in this approach are plausible and consistent , they must be verified by different methods .    _ monte carlo simulation",
    "_ is a completely independent method . here",
    "each photon is followed in the laboratory reference frame where the plasma is initially at rest while it experiences numerous collisions with the cross sections of compton and isotropic scattering models , until it ceases scattering .",
    "photons are injected in the expanding plasma well before it becomes transparent.the resulting photons constitute the final spectrum .",
    "the drawbacks of this approach are :  a prescribed distribution of an electron component and the impossibility to account for the stimulated emission of photons .",
    "the possibility to take into account pauli blocking in monte carlo simulations of degenerate relativistic plasmas has recently been discussed in ref .  .",
    "the first limitation originates from the fact that monte carlo simulations need a prescribed background of electrons , and any back - reaction of photons on the electron distribution can be only accounted for by an iterative scheme .",
    "the second limitation constrains the spectrum of photons in the optically thick region to have a wien shape instead of the planck one , if the model of compton scattering is used .",
    "in addition , the good statistics required to resolve both the low and high energy parts of the photon spectrum imply the need for a large number of photons which in turn demands long computational times .",
    "the _ fokker - planck approximation _ to the boltzmann equation allows one to take into account the stimulated emission of photons .",
    "however , it does not allow accounting for variations in the distribution function of the electron component . in this approach which solves partial differential equations , a rather good resolution in the spectrum can be achieved . in the recent study @xcite the formation of the spectrum from the photospheric emission in relativistic winds",
    "is analyzed with this method .",
    "the comoving temperature is assumed to depend on the laboratory radius as @xmath145 , where @xmath146 corresponds to the law of adiabatic expansion of the relativistic coasting wind . the low energy power law index @xmath147 of the observed spectrum is found to be a function of the power law index @xmath43 in the temperature distribution as @xmath148 .    finally , numerical solution of the _ system of boltzmann equations _ for electrons and photons is the most promising method . here",
    "compton scattering of photons is followed from high optical depth regions to low optical depth ones , and the complete evolution of both the photon and electron distributions can be obtained self - consistently . since finite difference methods are involved , the only limitation in this approach is the size of the grid in the phase space .",
    "next we give a short overview of methods suggested in ref .  .",
    "the basis of the spectrum and flux calculation is the radiative transfer equation for the specific intensity @xmath149 along the ray ( see e.g. , ref .  )",
    "@xmath150 where @xmath151 is the monochromatic emission coefficient for frequency @xmath2 , @xmath152 is the absorption coefficient and @xmath105 is the distance measured along the ray .",
    "the spectral intensity of radiation measured at infinity from a ray coming to an observer at some arrival time @xmath138 is given by the formal solution of this equation @xcite @xmath153\\right\\ }   \\,ds\\\\ & = \\int\\mathcal{i}_{\\nu}(\\nu , r,\\theta , t)\\exp[-\\tau(\\nu , r,\\theta , t)]\\,d\\tau , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath154 is the source function , equal to the ratio of emission and absorption coefficients @xmath155 , the optical depth @xmath156 is given by @xmath157 coinciding with eq .",
    "( [ tauwl ] ) , and the variables @xmath158 are connected by eq .",
    "( [ arrtime ] ) and @xmath159 .",
    "the total observed flux is an integral over all the rays @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the solid angle of the observer s detector as seen from the outflow in the laboratory frame and @xmath162 is an element of area in the plane of the sky .",
    "the emissivity @xmath151 is assumed to be thermal and isotropic in the comoving frame of the outflow and the comoving opacity is @xmath163 .",
    "the laboratory source function is then@xmath164 where @xmath165 is planck s constant .",
    "this approximation is justified when the radiation field is tightly coupled to the matter .",
    "the photospheric emission comes from the entire volume of the outflow , and the computational method sketched above is closely related to that used in ref .  , where the concept of the fuzzy photosphere  was introduced .",
    "this method is referred to as the _ fuzzy photosphere _ approximation .",
    "most of the energy reaching the observer is emitted from the region near the phe surface , where the probability density function along the ray given by eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) reaches its maximum . for this reason the dynamics of the phe surface discussed in the previous section determines both the light curves and spectra of the observed photospheric emission . assuming that all the energy comes from the phe surface only , i.e. , a surface instead of the volume discussed above",
    ", the computation may be reduced to a one - dimensional integration by substitution of the function @xmath166 by a dirac delta function .",
    "such a cruder approximation , in contrast with the fuzzy photosphere one , is referred to as the _ sharp photosphere _ approximation .",
    "in spite of the title this review , i conclude with a brief discussion of dissipative photospheric models of grbs .",
    "all these models assume that some energy is eventually converted into photons in the optically thick regime , which makes the photospheric component brighter .  in the literature such dissipation",
    "is associated with magnetic reconnection , neutron decay , collisional heating @xcite and internal shocks @xcite .",
    "consider generic dissipation models following ref .  .",
    "when the kinetic energy of the outflow is dissipated , electron - positron pairs may be created and the pair photosphere where the optical depth of the outflow due to compton scattering on pairs reaches unity may emerge .",
    "when continuous dissipation occurs in the steady coasting wind , the pair photosphere can be found from the balance between the rate of energy dissipation and the expansion rate @xmath167 .",
    "the former is given by @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the comoving photon density , @xmath44  is the electron mass , @xmath170  is the dissipated radiative luminosity in the observer frame , @xmath171  is the luminosity of the wind and @xmath172 is the efficiency parameter .",
    "assuming that photons have sufficient energy to produce pairs one can obtain the photospheric radius of pairs produced by dissipation of energy as@xmath173 when compared to the second line in eq .",
    "( [ rph ] ) we find @xmath174 . this pair photosphere may be located beyond the baryonic one , thus changing the observed properties of the photospheric emission with respect to the case without dissipation .",
    "another interesting effect is that the baryonic photosphere is also moved further away after dissipation has occurred due to the decrease in the lorentz factor .",
    "this may be important in a scenario with sudden dissipation at a certain radius above the saturation radius @xmath175 .",
    "when a sufficiently large fraction of the kinetic energy is converted back into thermal energy , the outflow may again become radiation - dominated and additional acceleration will occur . in this case",
    "photospheric emission will necessarily originate before the outflow starts to coast again .",
    "this means that impulsive strong dissipation may change the character of the photosphere .",
    "two particular scenarios were analyzed in ref .",
    ": with slow heating @xcite and with internal shock .",
    "while details of these scenarios vary , in both cases the role of dissipation is two - fold .",
    "firstly , it converts a fraction of kinetic or electromagnetic energy of the outflow into thermal energy .",
    "secondly , it is supposed to supply additional soft photons which may be comptonized on the population of electrons accelerated or heated by the dissipation process .",
    "numerical simulations performed in ref .  suggest that strong deviations from pure black body spectra are possible for various parameters of these models .",
    "in particular , when dissipation ( e.g. , shocks or heating ) occur at high optical depths of the outflow , the observed spectrum is dominated by the wien component which appears as result of comptonization regardless of the values of the parameters in the models considered . for intermediate optical depths on the order of unity , multiple scattering creates the flat energy per decade spectrum above the peak . for lower optical depths",
    "the dissipation is ineffective in broadening the spectral component originating from the photosphere .",
    "the basic feature of all photospheric models with dissipation is the possibility to further broaden the spectrum of the photospheric emission . besides",
    ", the intensity of the photospheric emission gets amplified .",
    "these models manage to reproduce some observed features in  grb spectra , see e.g. , ref .  .",
    "however , the need to produce a sufficient number of photons for thermalization implies strong constraints on the parameters of models involving dissipation , see e.g. , ref .  .",
    "moreover , so far there is no convincing dissipative model which on the one hand is based on a self - consistent relativistic hydrodynamics and/or kinetics , and on the other hand is able to reproduce many of the observational features of grbs .",
    "photospheric emission is a natural ingredient of most popular models of grbs such as the fireball , fireshell or electromagnetic models .",
    "despite the fact that grbs are not generally characterized by a planck spectrum , recent observations demonstrate that subdominant thermal components are likely to be present in many bursts .",
    "this fact makes photospheric models of grbs an attractive alternative to other models involving only optically thin emission mechanisms .    in this review",
    "i have discussed a number of different physical aspects , in particular relativistic effects , which make the photospheric emission from relativistic outflows an interesting subject to study . from this analysis",
    "it follows that the expectation that a relativistic photosphere produces a black body spectrum with a lorentz boosted temperature is too naive .",
    "one can ask a general question : is there a way to distinguish between a static optically thick source emitting from its photosphere and a relativistically expanding one ? it is the low energy part of the spectrum that holds the key to answering this question .",
    "the analysis performed so far implies that if the observational data are of sufficiently good quality in order to resolve the low energy part of the spectrum , the answer to this question is positive . as fig .",
    "[ photonthick ] clearly illustrates , the relativistically expanding source produces the spectrum with a low energy slope different from the planck case .",
    "possible dissipation near the photosphere may further broaden the observed spectrum and make it similar to the one observed in many grbs .",
    "the photosphere is likely not the only source of radiation responsible for producing grb emission , see ref .  .",
    "due to relativistic effects emission from the photosphere may arrive at the observer almost simultaneously with the optically thin emission @xcite .",
    "what is crucial , however , is that photospheric emission carries unique information about basic physical parameters of the relativistic outflow producing the grb .    * acknowledgement .",
