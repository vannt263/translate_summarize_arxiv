    "in the 1200@xmath81800 mev mass range , one expects that a tensor glueball , the @xmath1 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 nonets exist . at present , in this mass range , 13 isoscalar tensor states are claimed to exist experimentally@xcite .",
    "the state @xmath10 was claimed to be found in the data on the double - pomeron - exchange reaction @xmath11 at @xmath12 gev in an experiment r807 at cern isr@xcite , however , recent experiments on the same reaction do not see any evidence for @xmath10@xcite .",
    "its existence needs further experimental confirmation . among the other states , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are well known as the ground tensor states . above @xmath4",
    ", none of the reported isoscalar tensor states can be definitely assigned to be the member of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 nonets or the tensor glueball@xcite .",
    "recently , it is controversial that whether @xmath3 and @xmath4 need glueballs components or not .",
    "ref.@xcite sifted these overpopulated isoscalar tensor states using schwinger - type mass relations derived from a mass matrix in which only the @xmath7-glueball coupling was considered . inputing the masses of some observed but possibly confused states , ref.@xcite found that the physical tensor mesons @xmath3 and @xmath4 have a substantial glueball content .",
    "ref.@xcite assumed that @xmath13 is the quarkonia - glueball mixing state , and investigated the mixing of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath13 in the @xmath1 @xmath14 , @xmath1 @xmath15 and @xmath16 basis .",
    "ref.@xcite suggested that the absence of the gluonic components in the tensor mesons @xmath3 and @xmath4 due to the predicted branching ratios are incompatible with the experimental data .",
    "we favor the suggestion that @xmath3 and @xmath4 do nt need other components such as glueballs .",
    "since the mass of the lowest lying tensor glueball predicted by lattice qcd is larger than 2 gev@xcite , which is far from the masses of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , one can qualitatively expect that the mixing between the tensor glueball and the @xmath1 @xmath7 would be rather little@xcite .",
    "however , we propose that the states chosen in ref.@xcite are too arbitrary .",
    "first , the spin of @xmath17 has been controversial@xcite .",
    "_ argued that @xmath17 would be a @xmath7 state if @xmath18 and @xmath17 would be a mixed @xmath7 glueball having a large glueball component if @xmath19@xcite .",
    "however , evidence for spin 0 have accumulated recently in all production modes for @xmath17@xcite , and the state @xmath17 with @xmath19 has been cited by particle data group 2000 ( pdg 2000)@xcite .",
    "second , there is not any evidence that @xmath20 has advantages over other states to be assigned as a tensor glueball mixing with @xmath1 @xmath7 . in the viewpoint of a.v .",
    "et al._@xcite , it seems reasonable to assign @xmath20 as the first excitation of @xmath3 and @xmath21 as the first excitation of @xmath4 .",
    "if so , it is obviously unreasonable to discuss the mixing of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath20 in the @xmath1 @xmath22 , @xmath1 @xmath23 and @xmath24 basis . third , according to the masses of the states chosen in ref.@xcite , the mass of the lowest lying tensor glueball is determined to be about 1.5 gev .",
    "such a low mass tensor glueball would be very difficultly accommodated by lattice qcd which predicts the mass of the tensor glueball is larger than 2 gev@xcite . finally ,",
    "as mentioned above , except for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , none of the reported isoscalar tensor states can be definitely assigned to be the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 @xmath7 or the tensor glueball .",
    "there thus are not any convincing reasons to only choose @xmath13 but not other state to mix with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in this work",
    ", we shall avoid all the isoscalar tensor states which are confused or need further experimental confirmation , and adopt a simple model to quantitatively check that whether the @xmath3 and @xmath4 wave functions need other components such as glueballs or the @xmath1 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , ... @xmath7 or not .",
    "in the @xmath1 @xmath25 , @xmath1 @xmath26 basis , the mass - squared matrix describing the quarkonia - quarkonia mixing can be written as follows@xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the masses of the bare states @xmath1 @xmath30 and @xmath1 @xmath31 , respectively ; @xmath32 is a mixing parameter which describes the transition amplitude of @xmath33 annihilation and reconstitution via intermediate gluons states .",
    "the appearance of @xmath34 means that we consider the possibility that the transition between @xmath7 and @xmath35 is flavor - dependent .",
    "here we assume that the physical states @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath38 with the eigenvalues of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . diagonalizing the mass matrix @xmath38 , we have @xmath41 the physical states @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be written as @xmath42 where the unitary matrix @xmath43 can be given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) that @xmath47 from eqs . ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , @xmath32 and @xmath34 can be derived as @xmath48 apart from @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev@xcite , we take @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 gev@xcite as input , the numerical form of the unitary matrix can be given by @xmath53 then the physical states @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be given by @xmath54 if we re - express the two physical states in the gell - mann @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be read as @xmath57 with @xmath58 , which is in good agreement with the value of @xmath59 given by pdg 2000@xcite .",
    "for the hadronic decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 into two pseudoscalar mesons , we consider the coupling modes as indicated in fig .",
    "i : i ) the direct coupling of the quarkonia components of the initial mesons to the final pseudoscalar mesons occurring as the leading order decay mechanism , and ii ) the coupling of the quarkonia of the initial mesons to the final pseudoscalar mesons via intermediate gluons states occurring as the next leading order decay mechanism . based on these coupling modes ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing the hadronic decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 into two pseudoscalar mesons can be described as@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 describe the effective coupling strengths of the coupling modes i ) and ii ) , respectively ; @xmath63 and @xmath64 are @xmath65 flavor matrixes describing the @xmath7 components of the initial tensor mesons and the final pseudoscalar mesons , respectively .",
