    "stars form in molecular clouds , and most stars form in the large complexes of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) . a general theory to predict the location and amount of star formation in galaxies does not exist yet .",
    "the global drivers of star formation are generally sought in large scale processes that can form concentrations of hi gas ( elmegreen 2002 ) , for example gravitational instabilities in disk galaxies , or compression by galaxy interactions or mergers .",
    "these concentrations of neutral gas are then assumed to be the sites of molecular cloud and ultimately star formation .",
    "numerical simulations of galaxies have followed this lead and base their star formation model on the local density directly using a schmidt law @xcite , or gravitational instability and a jeans mass criterion @xcite . to date",
    "none of these efforts has incorporated the emergence and evolution of the h@xmath0 gas along with its precursor cold neutral medium ( cnm ) hi phase , except in a semi - empirical and somewhat adhoc fashion @xcite . the need to do so in a more self - consistent manner is now recognized from both numerical @xcite , and observational studies @xcite .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) consists of gas of wide ranging properties , from cold , dense molecular clouds to the cold and warm hi medium ( cnm , wnm ) , as well as the hot ionized medium intermixed in fractal - like structures .",
    "the physical processes governing the state of the ism have been progressively identified in the last few decades , but their precise working is still an area of active research @xcite .",
    "most galactic - scale simulations include only one phase , the wnm hi @xcite . some authors include more physics and consider a two - phase medium ( gerritsen & icke 1997 ; gerritsen & de blok 1999 ) . semi - empirical models of a multiphase ism @xcite suffer from the inclusion of many poorly understood parameters needed to describe the interaction of the various phases , which also forces such models to include serious simplifications ( e.g. a constant and uniform heating of the gas ) in order to keep the problem within the current computing capabilities ( semelin & combes 2002 ) .",
    "thus the robustness of such semi - empirical approaches in modeling real galaxies is rather limited .",
    "moreover , apart from the obvious fallacy of forming stars out of atomic gas , the absence of molecular gas in the simulations inhibits the comparison of the model galaxies with an extensive body of observational data , namely the distribution of h@xmath0 in galaxies ( as deduced via its tracer molecule co ) .",
    "the latter is observationally well - studied @xcite , it can offer additional constraints on the model galaxies , and the same is true for its observed empirical relations with other galactic components e.g. the young stars . for example the schmidt law that links local gas content to the star formation rate has been demonstrated to be a much tighter relation for molecular , rather than hi gas @xcite .",
    "some pioneering work that includes h@xmath0 in spiral galaxy simulations has been done by hidaka & sofue ( 2002 ) but they did not consider a time - dependent @xmath6 transition , which as we will argue in this work , is essential . our time - dependent treatment of the @xmath7 transition , implemented here in an n - body / sph code , can be incorporated into other types of code that include the ism evolution _ thus enabling the resulting galaxy simulations to track the gas phase most relevant to star formation , the molecular gas . _ our work fills two important `` gaps '' in the published literature , namely : a ) it makes a connection between galaxy - sized simulations and molecular cloud theory ( which lies behind the emergence of the power laws observed in the cool ism ) , and b ) connects large scale instabilities and the appearance of gmc - type complexes .",
    "the latter allows the integrated study of star formation and the h@xmath0 gas in the dynamic setting of realistic galaxy models that include effects of e.g. spiral density waves , self - propagating star formation , galaxy interactions and mergers , and a temporally and spatially varying interstellar radiation field .",
    "our presentation proceeds from a brief exposition of the h@xmath0 formation / destruction theory and the cloud power - laws underlying our sub - grid physics assumptions , on to its implementation in our numerical simulations while discussing the relevant details of the code we use .",
    "finally we present first results from simulations of typical dwarf galaxies , and conclude by outlining future work using the h@xmath0-tracking numerical models .",
    "the formation of h@xmath0 in galaxies has already been studied by elmegreen ( 1989 , 1993 ) , where the important role of ambient metallicity and pressure has been described .",
    "subsequent efforts to incorporate his approach into analytical models of galactic disks @xcite or numerical simulations @xcite have adopted stationary models , namely once an h@xmath0 formation criterion is satisfied the @xmath8 transition is set to be instantaneous .",
    "the time - dependence of several factors affecting this transition ( e.g. the ambient h@xmath0-dissociating fuv radiation field ) and the various gas heating and cooling processes were not considered , seriously restricting the ability of such models to track the evolution of the ism and particularly its h@xmath0 gas phase in a realistic manner .",
    "this is because the conditions affecting the hi@xmath1h@xmath0 equilibrium can vary over timescales comparable or shorter than that needed for the latter equilibrium to be reached .",
    "dust grains , when present , are the sites where h@xmath0 forms .",
    "its formation rate @xmath9 for gas with temperature @xmath10 and metallicity @xmath11 can then be expressed as    @xmath12    ( e.g. hollenbach , werner & salpeter 1971 ; cazaux & tielens 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "this equation expresses the h@xmath0 formation rate as the rate at which hi atoms with mean velocities @xmath13 collide with interstellar dust particles with effective surface @xmath14 , multiplied by the probability @xmath15 they stick on the grain surface and the probability @xmath16 they eventually form an h@xmath0 molecule that detaches itself from the grain . the grain surface @xmath17 ( and thus @xmath18 ) is assumed to scale linearly with metallicity z , namely @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 the grain geometric cross section and with the ratio of grain density to total hydrogen density @xmath21 ) .",
    "laboratory experiments usually constrain only the @xmath22 product for various temperature domains rather than provide information for each function separately ( e.g. pirronello et al .",
    "1997 ; katz et al .",
    "the theoretical study of buch & zhang ( 1991 ) yields a function @xmath23^{-2}$ ] ( with a characteristic energy scale @xmath24  k obtained from fitting results from molecular dynamics simulations ) valid for @xmath25 k , which we adopt in the present work ( but see also cazaux & spaans 2004 for the most recent views ) .",
    "we incorporate all the uncertainties of @xmath9 into a single parameter @xmath26 .",
    "these uncertainties stem mainly from the adopted probability functions and the effective surface for h@xmath0 formation .",
    "for example , the effective h@xmath0 formation surface may be bigger than implied by the visual extinction cross - section @xmath27 .",
    "the canonical formation rate @xmath28 ( jura 1974 , 1975 ) for typical cnm hi gas ( @xmath29 ) , corresponds to @xmath30 but values of @xmath31 are not excluded .",
    "early suggestions for such high @xmath26 values emerged from the study of rovibrational infrared lines of h@xmath0 in reflection nebulae ( sternberg 1988 ) , and observations of intense h@xmath0 rotational lines with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) in photodissociation regions @xcite .",
    "the timescale associated with h@xmath0 formation is then ( e.g. goldshmidt & sternberg 1995 )    @xmath32^{-1}\\ yrs,\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 and @xmath10 are the hi density and temperature . for @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36  k , typical of the cold neutral medium hi gas out",
    "of which h@xmath0 clouds form , @xmath37 yrs .",
    "this is comparable to the timescales of a wide variety of processes expected to fully disrupt or otherwise drastically alter typical molecular clouds and their ambient environments .",
    "some of the most important ones are star formation , with the disruptive effects of o , b , star clusters @xcite , turbulent dissipation @xcite , and inter - cloud clump - clump collisions @xcite .",

    "_ hence a realistic model of the hi@xmath38h@xmath0 transition in galaxies must be time - dependent . _    with this necessity in mind",
    ", we will first discuss the equilibrium fraction of molecular gas in the ism , before presenting a time dependent version of the model .      the equilibrium molecular gas fraction _",

    "the densities @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the hi and h@xmath0 densities , while the total hydrogen density is @xmath43 .",
    "the h@xmath0 dissociation rate @xmath44 is normalized for an ambient fuv field in units of the habing @xcite field value ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath46 is the normalized h@xmath0 self - shielding function which describes the decrease in dissociation rate due to the fuv absorption by the molecular column @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath48 is the fuv optical depth due to grain extinction , with a dust fuv absorption cross - section @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "3 can be converted to a separable differential equation for @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which , when integrated by parts for a uniform cloud , yields a total hi column density of    @xmath53    this is the total steady - state hi column density resulting from the fuv - induced h@xmath0 photodissociation of a one - side illuminated uniform cloud , and can be taken as a measure of the total ` thickness ' of the hi layer .",
    "the factor @xmath54 is an integral of the self - shielding function over the h@xmath0 column , which encompasses the details of h@xmath0 self - shielding .",
    "for @xmath55 it is    @xmath56    its numerical value was obtained for @xmath57 and a characteristic column density of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the equation of the @xmath59 balance still yields an analytical expression for @xmath60 for clouds with density profile : @xmath61 ( @xmath62 : the cloud radius ) .",
    "such a profile results from cloud models using a logotropic equation of state @xcite , hence we will refer to them as `` logotropic clouds , '' but the reason for considering such profiles here is to obtain a rough representation of sub - resolution , non - uniform , gmc density structure .",
    "the corresponding expressions for the equilibrium transition column density etc . for logotropic clouds are given in the appendix .",
    "the visual extinction corresponding to a transition column @xmath60 is given by ( using also the expressions for @xmath18 , @xmath63 from eqs 1 and 5 )    @xmath64.\\ ] ]    for a spherical constant density cloud the h@xmath0 gas mass fraction contained `` below '' the hi transition zone marked by @xmath65 is then given by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the area - averaged extinction of the cloud measured by an outside observer ( @xmath68 for @xmath69 ) .",
    "we consider @xmath70 to be a measure of the local molecular gas content of the ism , the implicit assumption being that most of the mass of the cool hi / h@xmath0 gas can be ultimately traced to such cloud structures .",
    "for cnm hi and the resulting h@xmath0 clouds this is a reasonable assumption and in certain models it is indeed predicted to be the final configuration of any initial warm ( @xmath71 k ) hi gas mass which quickly cools and fragments in an environment of constant `` background '' pressure @xcite .      from the previous discussion it becomes apparent that in order to calculate @xmath70 for a region of the ism we need an expression for the typical local mean cloud extinction @xmath72 .",
    "the crucial assumption we make here to derive an estimate for @xmath73 is that all unresolved cloud structures where the hi / h@xmath0 transition takes place obey the widely observed density - size power law @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the h@xmath0 gas is indeed observed to reside in giant molecular clouds , the sites of most star formation activity in galaxies , and these are observed to be virialized entities @xcite .",
    "their density / size scaling relation can be derived from an application of the virial theorem to clouds under a given boundary pressure @xmath74 @xcite and a universal ( velocity dispersion)-(cloud size ) relation .",
    "then it can be shown that the average h density is given by    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the cloud radius in parsecs .",
    "the range of the normalizing constant @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) can be determined theoretically by choosing a range of plausible polytropic solutions to the cloud density profiles @xcite , or from the _ observed _ n - r relations found for galactic molecular clouds .",
    "the latter approach , after using the scaling relation @xmath79 reported by larson ( 1981 ) ( @xmath80 ) , yields @xmath81  @xmath78 . in estimating @xmath82 from the observed n - r scaling relation we took into account that for the galactic midplane molecular clouds the outer pressure @xmath83 , but the boundary pressure on the molecular part of the cloud @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the invariance of the linewidth - size relation @xmath85 ( which for virialized clouds yields eq .",
    "[ eq_nmean ] ) has been recently verified over an extraordinary range of conditions as well as for the environments _ within _ clouds @xcite .",
    "this lends additional support to the use of the n - r scaling law as a non - evolving element of our assumed sub - grid physics .",
    "these relations are expected to break down only at very small scales where linewidths become dominated by thermal rather than macroscopic motions . for typical cnm temperatures setting @xmath86 yields",
    "@xmath87  pc , much smaller than the spatial resolution achievable in galaxy - size simulations like ours .",

    "it is obvious that high pressure gas will tend to be molecular , a result already known from the analytical / steady - state models of the @xmath95 transition in galactic disks @xcite .",
    "we can now compute the equilibrium @xmath96 values for interstellar gas for a given @xmath97 sampling the local conditions in the ism by using eq .",
    "7 ( or eq . b3 for logotropic clouds ) .",
    "input parameters are the radiation field @xmath98 , metallicity z , velocity dispersion @xmath94 and our h@xmath0 formation rate parameter @xmath26 . in figure 1",
    "we show the resulting equilibrium fraction @xmath70 for a number of typical values of these parameters .",
    "the true equilibrium molecular gas content will most likely be higher than @xmath70 since the real fuv field incident on gmcs is not radial and thus falls off more rapidly inside the absorbing cloud layers .",
    "higher gas densities expected to exist deeper in the clouds as part of any spatial and density substructure / clumping in the ism will act to raise the true @xmath96 . in that respect",
    "logotropic clouds are more realistic than those with uniform density .      the time - dependent hi / h@xmath0 transition can be approximated from the solution of equation 22 of goldshmidt & sternberg ( 1995 ) , which describes the evolution of the total hi column @xmath60 in the @xmath99 transition layer of a plane parallel slab of h@xmath0 gas with an impinging dissociating radiation field :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 ( the h@xmath0 formation timescale in the fully atomic part of the cloud ) , and the dimensionless quantity @xmath102 quantifies the local balance between h@xmath0 dissociation and formation and is given by    @xmath103    the assumption underlying the validity of eq .",
    "12 is that of a sharp hi / h@xmath0 transition layer separating the slab into a fully atomic and a fully molecular section . in the case of steady state eq .",
    "12 reduces to    @xmath104    which does not yield @xmath60 as expressed in eq .",
    "4 since the latter does not involve the approximation of a sharp hi / h@xmath0 transition made here .    in order to see at what step of deducing eq .",
    "4 the assumption of a sharp hi / h@xmath0 transition layer would yield the result in eq .",
    "14 we can use eq . 2 from goldshmidt and sternberg ( 1995 )    @xmath105   e^{-2\\sigma n(h_2 ) } e^{-\\sigma n(hi ) } dn(h_2).\\ ] ]    for a sharp hi / h@xmath0 transition zone not much hi can exist in that zone to significantly add to the total hi transition column density .",
    "hence , when integrating the last equation by parts , @xmath106 can be replaced by @xmath107 .",
    "the latter is then treated as a constant of integration over the h@xmath0 column density and kept out of the integral , yielding eq .",
    "we find the steady - state solutions provided by eq .",
    "14 to differ @xmath108 with those provided by the more accurate eq . 4 while other uncertainties of our model ( e.g. the effects of cnm hi gas substructure ) are expected to be more important .",
    "the sharpness of the hi / h@xmath0 transition zone ( @xmath109 for z=1 ) is due to the extreme self - shielding properties of the h@xmath0 molecule and has been known since the early theoretical models of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) ( hollenbach , takahashi & tielens 1991 ; hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .    a fully time - dependent treatment of the hi",
    "/ h@xmath0 transition is provided by solving eq .",
    "12 and then using @xmath110 $ ] to find the corresponding @xmath111 from eq . 7",
    "although the approximation of a narrow transition layer is not strictly valid , the time dependent solution of the full integro - differential equation would be too costly for use in numerical simulations , and also the uncertainties inherent in our model would not justify the additional expense for the more exact solution . in figure [ gsfig ]",
    "we compare the solution of eq .",
    "12 with the full solution as calculated by goldshmidt & sternberg ( 1995 ) .",
    "the main difference is that our solution for the @xmath112 grows roughly @xmath113 slower , which gives an effect similar to an error of @xmath113 in e.g. the grain opacity or h@xmath0 formation rate parameter .",
    "the preceding description of the hi / h@xmath0 balance is not valid for gas much warmer than its cnm phase where collisional rather than fuv - induced destruction of h@xmath0 dominates . under such conditions @xmath114",
    "since once @xmath115 k , the h@xmath0 formation effectively becomes zero @xcite and any remaining ( from the fuv destruction ) h@xmath0 will eventually be collisionally destroyed , especially at temperatures @xmath116 . moreover , at such high temperatures the cloud scaling laws ( and hence the expressions used to estimate @xmath96 ) no longer hold since the observed `` cloud '' linewidths are then almost purely thermal and thus no longer scale with size .    in principle the collisional destruction of a purely molecular gas will first be dominated by h@xmath0-h@xmath0 collision processes and later on by the more efficient h@xmath0-hi collisions . if we look at the collisional destruction coefficients for these two processes we see that for the h@xmath0 collisions to be more important the condition    @xmath117    must be satisfied at @xmath118 k ( martin , keogh , & mandy 1998 ) . in the wnm gas phase such a high percentage of remaining h@xmath0",
    "( remaining from the dominant fuv destruction mechanisms operating in the cnm and the cnm - to - wnm phases ) is unlikely .",
    "we thus consider only the hi collisional destruction term as important and then the h@xmath0 density will be controlled by    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is the h@xmath0-hi collisional destruction coefficient .",
    "the ( analytic ) solution of this will be employed for the high temperature domain .",
    "here we must mention that we assumed no fuv - induced hi / h@xmath0 spatial segregation in the wnm phase .",
    "if there is some remnant spatial segregation h@xmath0 would be destroyed by the much less effective h@xmath0 collisions , thus our assumption most likely overestimates the level of collisional h@xmath0 destruction in the wnm phase .",
    "we implement a module incorporating the aforementioned `` recipe '' to track the @xmath121 gas phase interplay in an n - body / sph code for galaxy simulations that includes a model of the neutral gas phases .",
    "n - body / sph codes are in routine use within the astrophysical community as tools to explore problems in galaxy evolution and formation , and their full description can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we use the new conservative sph formulation of springel & hernquist ( 2002 ) .",
    "the artificial viscosity used is the standard monaghan ( 1992 ) viscosity .",
    "the code we use is a major upgrade of gerritsen ( 1997 ) and gerritsen & icke ( 1997 ) , mainly in its description of the evolution of the stellar and gaseous components .",
    "a complete description can be found in pelupessy ( 2005 ) , here we will highlight the aspects most relevant .",
    "the main feature making this code especially attractive for incorporating the @xmath122 phase transition is its detailed modeling of the ism , including physics of the wnm and cnm hi phases , as well as the modelling of star formation and feedback .",
    "this allows us to conduct high resolution simulations following the ism gas as it cools down to temperatures of @xmath123 k and densities @xmath124 @xmath125 , conditions expected to be typical of the @xmath95 transition phase .",
    "note that the addition of our hi / h@xmath0 model does not add a major computational burden to the code : in practice we find that @xmath126 of cpu time is taken up by the molecule formation routines .",
    "furthermore the necessary calculations ( solving eq .",
    "12 using an implicit integration scheme ) scale linearly with the number @xmath127 of particles , whereas the time consuming parts of the simulation ( gravity and neighbour searching , which take up @xmath128 of cpu time for the simulations presented here ) scale as @xmath129 for an n - body / sph code@xcite .",
    "our model for the ism is similar to the equilibrium model of wolfire et al .",
    "( 1995 , 2003 ) for the neutral phases and was extended from the more simplified models from gerritsen & icke ( 1997 ) and bottema ( 2003 ) .",
    "we consider a gas with arbitrary but fixed chemical abundances @xmath130 , scaled to the target metallicity from solar abundances .",
    "we solve for the ionization and thermal evolution of the gas .",
    "the thermal evolution is solved with a predictor / corrector step as in @xcite .",
    "the various processes included in the ism model are given in table  1 .",
    "the main differences with the work of gerritsen & icke ( 1997 ) and bottema ( 2003 ) are the following : we use more accurate cooling , that is calculated in accordance with the chemical composition , we solve for the ionization balance ( albeit still assuming ionization equilibrium ) and we use the full photoelectric heating efficiency as given in wolfire et al .",
    "indicatively , in figure [ ismfigm ] we plot the equilibrium temperature , ionization fraction , heating ( = cooling ) and pressure as a function of density . there",
    "it can be seen that as density varies the equilibrium state of the gas changes from a high temperature / high ionization state ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) at low densities , to a low temperature / low ionization state ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) at high densities . in between",
    "there is a density domain where the negative slope of the p - n relation indicates that the gas is unstable to isobaric pressure variations , the classic thermal instability @xcite .",
    "the shape of these curves and hence the exact densities of the thermal instability vary locally throughout the simulation , influenced by the time - varying uv radiation field and supernova heating .",
    "we set a constant cosmic ray ionization rate @xmath135 throughout the galaxy , assumed to be @xmath136 .",
    "although we will consider models of different metallicities we will not consider the effects of abundance gradients or enrichment here . in general",
    "the abundance gradients observed in dwarf galaxies are small @xcite , so this is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the fact that we keep the metallicity constant in time means that the model as presented here is not yet suitable to follow the evolution over cosmological timescales or to simulate very low metallicity dwarfs ( for the simulations presented here the evolution in z would be less than @xmath137 over the course of the simulation , even if no metals were to be lost to the intergalactic medium ) .",
    "the coldest and densest phase in our model is best identified with the cnm , where gmcs most likely form and remain embedded .",
    "we will use the simple prescription for star formation of gerritsen & icke ( 1997 ) as our standard star formation model .",
    "it was shown to reproduce the star formation properties of ordinary spiral galaxies and it is based on the assumption that the star formation process is governed by gravitational instability . a gaseous region is considered unstable to star formation if the local jeans mass @xmath138 ,    @xmath139    ( with s the sound speed ) , the assumption being that structure on a mass scale @xmath140 is present in the ism .",
    "once a region is dense and cold enough that ( 18 ) is fullfilled , the rate of star formation rate is set to scale with the local free fall time @xmath141 :    @xmath142    the delay factor @xmath143 accounts for the fact that cloud collapse is inhibited by either small scale turbulence or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "its value is uncertain and we consider values @xmath144 . the actual implementation of star formation works as follows : once a gas particle is found to be unstable according to the jeans mass criterion it can spawn a star particle with a mass one eighth of the mass of a gas particle ( thus a given gas particle can produce at most eight star particles )",
    ". the process is governed by either drawing from a poisson distribution such that the local rate of star formation agrees with eq .",
    "19 in a stochastic sense , or by imposing a fixed delay time .",
    "our basic star formation recipe does not depend explicitly on the local h@xmath0 fraction , so while the gravitational collapse that induces star formation may also precipitate h@xmath0 formation , it is nevertheless independent of whether the gas is atomic or molecular .",
    "however , our model now allows for a direct link between star formation and the presence of molecular gas .",
    "we can do this by setting a local threshold for @xmath70 above which star formation can proceed . as we will discuss in section 4.2.2",
    "this may be more realistic since in such a scenario the values of the delay factor are no longer assumed a priori but are instead implemented in a more physical fashion by the `` delay '' associated with the final chemical/ thermodynamic evolution of a gas cloud before star formation .    in order to determine the local fuv field used for calculating the photoelectric heating and the h@xmath0 destruction rates , we determine the time - dependent fuv luminosity of the stellar particles .",
    "we do so by following their age and , since star particles represent stellar associations rather than single stars , by using bruzual & charlot ( 1993 and updated ) population synthesis models .",
    "we assume a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with cutoffs at @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in the present work",
    "we do not account for dust extinction of uv light , except that of the young stars shrouded in their natal cloud : for a young stellar cluster we decrease the amount of uv extinction from 75% to 0% in 4 myr @xcite .",
    "feedback from stellar winds and supernovae is essential for regulating the physical conditions of the ism .",
    "while the mechanical energy output of stars is reasonably well known , it has proven to be difficult to include it completely self - consistently in galaxy - sized simulations of the ism .",
    "the reason for this is that the effective energy of feedback depends sensitively on the energy radiated away in thin shells around the bubbles created .",
    "this will mean that the effect of feedback can not be tracked in a straightforward manner unless prohibitively high resolution is used .",
    "in sph codes there have been conventionally two ways to account for this : by changing the thermal energy input and by acting on particle velocities .",
    "both are unsatisfactory , as the thermal method suffers from overcooling @xcite and the kinetic method seems to be too efficient in stirring the ism @xcite . here",
    "we use a new method based on the creation at the site of young stellar clusters of a _ pressure particle _ that acts as a normal sph particle in the limit of the mass of the particle @xmath147 , for constant energy . for the energy injection rate ( which assumes that the energy injection takes place continuously , without distinguishing between stellar winds and supernovae ) we take @xmath148 with @xmath149",
    "erg the energy liberated per supernova , an efficiency parameter @xmath150 , the number of supernova per mass of new stars formed @xmath151 per @xmath152 ( appropriate for the imf adopted here ) and @xmath153 yr . the efficiency @xmath154 thus assumes that 90% of the initial supernova energy is radiated away in structures not resolved by our simulation .",
    "this value has been found in detailed simulations of the effects of supernovae and stellar winds on the ism @xcite , and is also used in other simulations of galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "moreover in a study by pelupessy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) the adopted feedback strength has been shown to be consistent with the observed scatter in the star formation properties of isolated dwarf galaxies .",

    "we take the formal sph estimate    @xmath162    with @xmath163 and @xmath164 the particle velocities and masses , @xmath165 the local bulk velocity .",

    "depending on the cloud model , we use eqs 12 or b5 when @xmath169 to track the evolution of @xmath170 , and thus @xmath171 , during a simulation timestep dt . for @xmath172 and @xmath173 eq .",

    "the radiation field is calculated from the distribution of stars , where the assumption is that extinction from dust , or from molecular clouds is not important ( apart from extinction from the natal cloud ) .",
    "after we have evolved @xmath170 for the timestep @xmath176 the resulting @xmath96 ( eqs 7 , b3 ) is calculated and assigned to the sph particle for the duration of the next timestep ( where it can be used to calculate e.g. cooling ) . at the next timestep _",
    "the last @xmath70 value is retained _ and used to calculate the initial @xmath177 , given the new average cloud extinction @xmath73 , which may have changed from the previous time - step , if for example the pressure @xmath74 has changed .",
    "the choice to keep @xmath70 rather than @xmath178 constant during any variations of @xmath179 is dictated by the decision to assign all variations of @xmath70 to the fuv - regulated hi / h@xmath0 gas phase interplay , as tracked by eqs 12 and b5 rather than to any instantaneous effects .",
    "indeed , if @xmath178 instead of @xmath70 was to be kept constant during variations of @xmath180 over a given time - step , it would correspond to an @xmath171 that instantaneously follows the variations of @xmath181 .",
    "this may not be entirely without merit since whatever processes are responsible for setting up cloud structures that obey power laws like that expressed by eq .",
    "8 may be also responsible for a fast concurrent h@xmath0 formation @xcite . nevertheless at this stage",
    "we chose not to consider this possibility since the cloud power laws are assumed `` frozen '' during our simulations and allowing instantaneous effects on @xmath70 ( via variations of @xmath182 ) would run counter to the spirit of our effort to model the time evolution of the hi , h@xmath0 gas phases without such influences .",
    "in the future we intend to explore this possibility to see whether it is important when compared to the fuv - regulated hi / h@xmath0 phase interplay explored here .      in order to track dense gas our simulations employ sph particle masses of @xmath183",
    "( see section 4.2.1 ) where it can be argued that the applicability of the scaling laws used to deduce @xmath171 is doubtful because such small masses are well below those of even the smallest gmcs and thus represent cloud fragments instead .",
    "however , individual sph particles do not represent the smallest resolved objects of our simulations , rather this is set by the total number of particles used to derive the formal sph estimate of the mean density .",
    "the latter is of the order @xmath184 ( see section 4.2 ) , comparable to small molecular clouds .",
    "furthermore , it must be noted that the applicability of the n - r scaling law for their @xmath140 sub - units is based on the virial theorem and the universality of the linewidth - size relation .",
    "the latter has now been confirmed to hold for scales and environments well inside typical molecular clouds and with the same normalizing constant as for entire clouds , a fact attributed to the universality of large - scale driving mechanisms for turbulence ( heyer & brunt 2004 ) . regarding the virial theorem , it is a simple corollary that if gmcs are virialized objects so will be any of their sub - units albeit at different boundary pressures , thus eqs 8 , 10 are expected to hold even for @xmath185 cloud masses making up larger gmc - type ensembles ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "the latter of course assumes that the correct boundary pressure @xmath74 is used in eqs 8 , 10 , which as we already discussed may be poorly represented by the formal sph estimate of the macroscopic velocity dispersion .",
    "thus our model is applicable for scales where the size - linewidth relation and the assumption of virial equilibrium are valid , which will certainly not be the case in dense star forming cores , but does seem to be true at the larger scales as probed by galaxy scale simulations .",
    "our first application will be a model of a dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "there are a number of practical reasons to choose this type of a system as a test model , as well as some interesting issues that are particular for dwarf galaxies that can be explored using our model ( e.g. h@xmath0 vs hi gas supply ) .",
    "the small size of these systems allow relatively high resolution with modest computational effort .",
    "indeed the choice of dwarf galaxies as modeling templates allows a given numerical simulation to probe small physical scales and high gas densities , the latter being of crucial importance if the @xmath187 phase transition is to be tracked successfully .",
    "insight gained from simulating these systems , whose properties are constrained by a wealth of observational data ( van zee 2001 ; barone et al .",
    "2000 ; de paz , madore & pevunova 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore it holds the promise of yielding good constraints about physical processes that are expected to be universal in galaxies ( see e.g. similar work done for sn feedback strength ; pelupessy , van der werf , & icke 2004 ) .    aside from being excellent testbeds for quantifying phenomena expected to be common across the hubble sequence , dwarf galaxies are important systems on their own right because of their possibly very important role in current galaxy formation theories as the building `` blocks '' of larger systems @xcite , and as major `` polluters '' of the intergalactic medium with metals @xcite .",
    "we construct a simple model of a dwarf irregular with gas mass of @xmath188 and a stellar mass of @xmath189 . specifically , the gas disk has radial surface density profile    @xmath190    with central density @xmath191 and radial scale @xmath192 , truncated at 4 kpc .",
    "an exponential stellar disk ,    @xmath193    with central surface density @xmath194 , @xmath195 and vertical scale height @xmath196 , is constructed as in kuijken & dubinski  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the gaseous and stellar components are represented by @xmath197 particles each . for the gravitational softening length of the stellar particles a value of 20 pc",
    "is adopted , while for the gas particles it is taken to be equal to the sph smoothing length .",
    "the ages of the initial population of stars are distributed according to a constant star formation rate ( sfr ) and an age of 13 myr .",
    "+    the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies are generally best fit using dark halos with a flat central core ( flores & primack 1994 , burkert 1995 ) .",
    "therefore we take a halo profile    @xmath198    with core radius @xmath199 , cutoff radius @xmath200 and central density @xmath201 , for a total mass of @xmath202 and a peak rotation velocity of about 50 km / s .",
    "note that the profile adopted is very similar to the burkert ( 1995 ) profile .",
    "they differ mainly in their asymptotic behaviour for @xmath203 , thus the burkert profile will only deviate significantly well outside the region of interest for our simulation ( within 20 kpc the difference in rotation velocity of the adopted density profile and a burkert profile with the same central density is @xmath204 ) .",
    "we represent the dark - matter halo by a static potential .",
    "the mass resolution of the simulation limits the density that can be probed .",
    "we can derive some minimum requirements in order for our model to be able to follow the @xmath8 transition .",
    "in addition , it may be necessary to consider the effect of h@xmath0 cooling .",
    "finally , unlike previous numerical work reported in the literature , the range of values for the delay factor @xmath205 , which regulates star formation , can now be explored under constraints imposed by the observationally - motivated demand that h@xmath0 forms ahead of stars .",
    "simulations of self - gravitating fluids done with insufficient numerical resolution can suffer from artifacts : artificial clumping or inhibition of gravitational collapse may occur .",
    "for sph simulations including self - gravity these effects can arise if the local jeans mass is not resolved ( bate & burkert 1997 ; whitworth 1998 ) .",
    "hence , this requires for our simulation    @xmath207    with n the number of sph neighbours and @xmath208 is the mass of an sph particle . in our simulations",
    "this requirement is met by choosing appropriate star formation parameters so that violation of eq .",
    "27 is precluded by star formation .",
    "a gas particle will `` spawn '' star particles , and thus be subjected to heating that raises the local jeans mass , whenever @xmath209 .",
    "taking @xmath210 in effect makes the choice of mass ( and density ) resolution equivalent to the choice of @xmath211 .",
    "the density resolution of our simulations must be high enough so that h@xmath0 formation can compete with fuv dissociation ( i.e. @xmath212 , eq .",
    "13 ) . in figure 1",
    "it is apparent that densities of @xmath213 are sufficient to follow the @xmath214 transition , while somewhat higher densities may be necessary for low metallicity gas .",
    "for such densities and at typical @xmath215 , eq .",
    "18 yields @xmath216 . hence running the simulation with particle masses of @xmath217 allows a good resolution of the aforementioned mass scale . apart from properly tracking the hi / h@xmath0 phase transition , setting a small @xmath218 allows gmc - type , star - forming associations of gas particles to naturally emerge in the simulations",
    "indeed , gmc - class gas masses of @xmath219 can then emerge as assemblies of smaller star - forming cloud units .",
    "our star formation criterion @xmath220 , where @xmath221 , ensures that such self - gravitating sph particle formations ( which previous simulations show emerging , e.g. gerritsen 1997 ) always contain gravitationally unstable regions that form stars , exactly as in real gmcs . in that respect @xmath140 can be viewed as a mass `` radius '' attached to individual sph particles which defines the jeans - mass instability , and which is itself smaller than the mass of typical gmc aggregates , the preferred sites of star formation in galaxies .",
    "if one were to choose @xmath222 stars could then form from `` cloud '' mass scales that are never seen star forming in nature . as a final note on the choice of @xmath140 it worths mentioning that observational studies have shown that o",
    ", b stars do not form in gmcs with masses below @xmath223 ( elmegreen 1990 ) .",
    "thus choosing @xmath224 makes our simulations capable of following the evolution of the smallest gmcs seen forming stars in galaxies .      in our standard star formation recipe the delay for star formation to occur is set by the free parameter @xmath205 ; our default choice is a fixed value of @xmath225 . in the past typical values of @xmath226",
    "were chosen so that the expected star formation rate from the gmcs present e.g. in the milky way would be similar to the one observed .",
    "dedicated high - resolution simulations of individual molecular clouds may shed some light on this issue ( e.g. maclow et al 1998 ) , but for the time being the choice of @xmath143 in galaxy - size simulations like ours remains rather apriori .",
    "nevertheless the fact that everywhere in the local universe stars seem to form out of molecular rather than atomic gas allows us to deduce a lower limit on the value of @xmath205 .",
    "indeed , for h@xmath0 formation to remain always ahead of star formation it must be @xmath227 , which from eqs 2 and 19 yields ,    @xmath228.\\ ] ]    since cnm hi is the most likely precursor phase of the h@xmath0 gas , for typical conditions of @xmath229 and @xmath230 , the latter equation yields @xmath231 .",
    "these values are roughly similar to those deduced using the constraints on the observed star formation rate in the galaxy . given the uncertainties inherent in e.g. the @xmath232 function , such a rough agreement is noteworthy and here it is worth mentioning that @xmath233 is also a good approximation of chemical equilibrium timescales in fuv - illuminated clouds @xcite .",
    "thus the rough agreement of the constraint set by eq .",
    "28 with what are considered reasonable @xmath205 values may signify an important role for cloud chemistry in setting the average star formation rate .",
    "this is not far - fetched since molecule formation enables very different gas cooling functions and thus drastically alters its thermodynamic state allowing to eventually cool and fragment further ( well beyond the resolution limit for galaxy - sized simulations ) ( e.g. chize & des forts  1987 ) . for these reasons",
    "we will also discuss a model for the star formation which depends on @xmath70 directly .",
    "a detailed calculation of h@xmath0 cooling was done by le bourlot et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . at @xmath234 h@xmath0 is a more efficient coolant than the other major coolants ( c and fe ) .",
    "hence even a low ( @xmath235 ) remnant abundance of molecular gas in the diffuse wnm can have an impact on the cooling at these temperatures .",
    "indeed some people have included h@xmath0 cooling in their cooling curves , but without calculating the abundance of molecules @xcite . admittedly our accuracy in following the amount of warm molecular gas is limited , but to get some idea of the possible effect of such a gas phase it is nevertheless interesting to do some calculations including h@xmath0 cooling . for this we use the le bourlot cooling curve , where we use a limited set of data ( low density limit , constant ortho - to - para ratio , only h@xmath0-h collision excitation ) , appropriate for our purposes .",
    "note that some observations find abundances of h@xmath0 gas the order of @xmath236 in diffuse hi gas , even in regions of the ism hostile to h@xmath0 formation , like galactic high velocity clouds @xcite .",
    "in a model that incorporates h@xmath0 formation the two obviously important parameters that should be explored are : the formation rate @xmath26 , and the metallicity z. the formation rate is uncertain by a factor of 5 - 10 , and thus introduces some uncertainty in the theoretically calculated h@xmath0 content , e.g. for high formation rates significant amounts of warm and diffuse h@xmath0 may be present in the outer parts of spiral galaxies ( papadopoulos , thi , & viti 2002 ) .",
    "metals play an important role : the h@xmath0 formation rate is directly proportional to the dust surface available , and we take this surface to be proportional to z. dust also plays an important role shielding molecules from uv radiation .",
    "observations of low metallicity systems , like dwarf irregulars , using co as a tracer give low molecular gas contents @xcite . however , the interpretation of these observations is complicated by the fact that the conversion factor from co flux to h@xmath0 mass under these conditions depends heavily on metallicity and ambient fuv field : for low metallicity , fuv - intense environments co dissociates while the largely self - shielding h@xmath0 is not affected by much @xcite .    in this work",
    "we explore a 2x2 grid of models using a formation rate of @xmath237 and @xmath238 , and metallicities of either @xmath239 or @xmath240 .",
    "note that for our model dwarf galaxy the high metallicity is somewhat unrealistic , because normally dwarf galaxies have lower metal content .",
    "note also that for simulations without h@xmath0 cooling our subgrid model follows the h@xmath0 content as a passive tracer of the history of the local conditions , thus the simulations for high and low formation rate will be identical except for the amount of h@xmath0 .",
    "we start the simulation with an isothermal gas disk at @xmath241 , and a molecular fraction @xmath242 . after the start of the simulation",
    "the gas cools and collapses along the z - direction , forming regions of cold and dense gas in the midplane ( the minimum size of structures resolved in the simulation is about 30 pc ) .",
    "there , h@xmath0 starts to form and star formation starts taking place as well .",
    "the fact that we start from an unrealistically smooth initial condition results in some transient effects , but after approximately 200 myr the galaxies settle in a stationary state , with a constant star formation ( see figure [ fg_sf ] ) . for this model galaxy ,",
    "the mean star formation rate is about @xmath243 for low z and @xmath244 for high z , with modest variations ( the gas depletion timescale is much longer than the duration of our simulation , in the order of @xmath245  yr ) .",
    "the star formation values we get represent fairly typical values for a low surface brightness dwarf @xcite .",
    "also plotted in figure 4 is the average star formation density as a function of radius , note the exponential distribution of star formation and the sudden truncation . during the simulation a small fraction ( @xmath246 ) of the gas is expelled out of the disk , but most of this falls back .",
    "a hot galactic wind is not formed , the low mass loss rate associated with the expected wind for this model can not be resolved by our current mass resolution .",
    "an equilibrium fraction of h@xmath0 is reached on timescales of @xmath247 myr ( see figure [ fg_fmtime ] ) , in agreement with our earlier approximate estimates from eq .",
    "2 . furthermore ,",
    "as expected , the low-@xmath26/low - z simulation yields the lowest equilibrium molecular fraction of @xmath248 and a higher formation rate @xmath249 will boost that to @xmath250 . for high metallicities , molecular fractions of @xmath251 ( @xmath237 ) and @xmath252 ( @xmath238 ) form .",
    "also drawn in figure [ fg_fmtime ] is the time dependence of the molecular fraction for a low-@xmath26/low - z simulation with logotropic clouds .",
    "the difference between constant density and logotropic clouds is not very large , certainly smaller than the differences due to the uncertainties of @xmath253 ( this is also evident in the equilibrium values of @xmath171 shown in the panels in figure 1 , where the main difference between constant density and logotropic clouds was that for logotropic clouds appreciable fractions @xmath254 appear also at lower densities ) .    in figures [ fg_rfm ] and [ fg_hfm ]",
    "we show the ( mean ) molecular fraction as a function of radius and height above the disk - plane for the four simulations .",
    "we see that , as expected , h@xmath0 forms mostly in the central regions and in the midplane where the pressure and gas density builds up .",
    "note also that for high metallicity and high formation rate the molecular fraction seems to have a tendency to  saturate  in the central regions at a fixed value , in this case @xmath255 .",
    "looking in more detail at the spatial distribution of hi and h@xmath0 shown in figure [ fg_hih2maps ] we find h@xmath0 mainly concentrated in the dense clumps and filaments of the hi distribution .",
    "the structure of the ism can be quantitatively compared with observations by analyzing the power spectrum of the hi maps such as those in figure [ fg_hih2maps ] .",
    "this is done in figure [ fg_pw ] , where we see that it agrees quite well with power spectra made for the most detailed studied dwarf galaxy , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and is stable over the course of the simulation and as a function of resolution .",
    "if we now compare the low and high @xmath26 simulations , we see similar h@xmath0 distributions : _ the uncertainty in the formation parameter is mainly an uncertainty in the amount of h@xmath0 formed , not in the locations of h@xmath0 formation_. the relative distribution of h@xmath0 is well represented by our simulation , but the exact amount of h@xmath0 is more difficult to determine , as this depends on the formation rate parameter . if we look at the high metallicity simulations , we can see that , apart from the clumpy distribution there is also a sizable mass of  diffuse ",
    "h@xmath0 , but still confined mainly in gas filaments .",
    "finally we look at the relation between star formation and h@xmath0 distribution . in figure",
    "[ fg_h2hamaps ] we show a simulated  h@xmath256  map ( actually a map of the stellar luminosity in ionizing photons ) , overplotted with contours of h@xmath0 gas , chosen so that they highlight the relation of star formation to the densest parts of the h@xmath0 distribution .",
    "it can be seen that star formation is almost always associated with some nearby h@xmath0 gas complex while some of them , being without newly formed stars at that particular instant , do not show any h@xmath256 emission .",
    "apart from the parameters directly related to h@xmath0 formation , @xmath171 will also depend on the delay factor @xmath205 . as discussed in section 4.2.2",
    ", this parameter accounts for the fact that a region that is jeans - unstable does not collapse to form stars at the free - fall time @xmath257 .",
    "the total amount of h@xmath0 is sensitive to the time hi gas stays in a cold and dense phase conducive to h@xmath0 formation , while the emergence of new stars from such a phase helps dissociate h@xmath0 by dramatically increasing the ambient fuv radiation . indeed , comparing models run with different values for @xmath205 reveals the total amount of molecular gas to be strongly dependent on this parameter ( figure [ fg_fmtime_tcol ] ) . in short ,",
    "the formation of stars and h@xmath0 are in competition , and small enough delay factors can quench h@xmath0 formation . yet , a value of @xmath258 , as constrained by the observed gmc masses and the star formation rate in the galaxy , amply satisfy eq .",
    "28 and h@xmath0 formation preceeds star formation .      in section 4.2.2",
    "we have argued for a connection between star formation and chemical timescales , the latter well approximated by the h@xmath0 formation timescale .",
    "a simple and direct implementation of this idea is to replace the preset delay time @xmath259 by a threshold molecular fraction @xmath260 for the onset of star formation . in this case",
    "the delay factor @xmath205 is no longer needed ; the `` delay '' from a pure free - fall timescale is now the outcome of the interplay between the competing physical processes that lie behind the establishment of @xmath70 .",
    "we rerun the @xmath261 simulation with this new star formation recipe and a threshold value of @xmath262 . in figure [ fg_fmtime_tcol ]",
    "we have plotted @xmath70 for this case . as can be seen",
    ", the equilibrium molecular fraction goes down significantly , to @xmath263 , which is easily understood , because such a low threshold value will almost immediately destroy h@xmath0 once it forms . for higher threshold values",
    "@xmath70 is higher , @xmath264 and @xmath265 for @xmath266 and @xmath267 respectively ( this is still less than for the normal recipe , because for this case about @xmath268 of h@xmath0 is in regions with @xmath269 ) .",
    "the star formation rate for these models is about @xmath270 .    in figure [ fg_tausf ]",
    "we plot the resulting ( cumulative ) distribution of delay times @xmath259 , normalized on the local free - fall time @xmath141 . a higher threshold results in longer average delay times , from @xmath271 for @xmath262 to @xmath272 for @xmath273 .",
    "however , the fraction with @xmath274 stays roughly constant .",
    "the reason for this is that once star formation starts in a region , it takes some time for feedback to kick in . in the mean time molecule formation",
    "continues , and the molecular regulated star formation allows for extra star formation events if enough h@xmath0 forms ( in the previous implementation of star formation there was no such possibility ) . in other words , _ the local star formation efficiency is partly determined by the h@xmath0 formation . _",
    "a high value for @xmath260 seems to be favoured , because star formation regions are observed to be mainly molecular , and in this case both the h@xmath0 fractions and local star formation rates are consistent with what is known from observations .",
    "hence this model for star formation seems promising for future application .",
    "the inclusion of h@xmath0 cooling affects the simulation in a number of ways . as an extra coolant",
    "it will increase the amount of gas in a cold state , and in turn this will increase the formation of h@xmath0 .",
    "however , star formation will also increase , and thus also the uv field . in figure [ fg_fmcool ] the effect of cooling on @xmath96",
    "is illustrated for the @xmath237 simulations . as can be seen",
    ", cooling has some influence for the high z simulation but for low z the molecular fractions are too low to substantially alter the results .",
    "note that while h@xmath0 is a strong coolant at high temperatures ( a few thousand k ) , where it dominates the cooling for @xmath275 , the effect of the extra cooling is limited because of the small amount of gas at these temperatures .",
    "detection and mapping of the molecular component of dwarf galaxies is usually done by mapping the @xmath276 line @xcite or by uv absorption studies ( tumlinson et al .",
    "the derived h@xmath0 fractions are @xmath277 , but for low metallicity systems co is often not detected corresponding to upper limits for the molecular fraction of @xmath278 .",
    "recently a large observational effort has detected @xmath279co j=10 in several more dwarf galaxies increasing the number of such systems with detected co emission by @xmath280 ( leroy et al .",
    "2005 ) .    at this stage a direct comparison of our simulations with available co imaging data must be made cautiously .",
    "this is because our simulations follow the formation of h@xmath0 not co. the latter is the most abundant molecule after h@xmath0 itself and serves as the prime tracer of its mass ( e.g. dickman , snell , & schloerb 1986 ; young & scoville 1991 ) , yet it is still four orders of magnitude less abundant and thus , unlike h@xmath0 , it can not self - shield .",
    "this is the main reason why in metal - poor and fuv - intense environments like those prevailing in dwarf galaxies co ( but not h@xmath0 ) will be dissociated and its emission can then give a rather misleading picture of the h@xmath0 mass distribution ( e.g. madden et al .",
    "even if a simplified version of the chemical network giving rise to co ( e.g. nelson & langer 1997 ) were to be included in the simulations , densities @xmath281 and temperatures @xmath282 would have to be tracked in order to successfully model co formation , and these are currently inaccessible by galaxy - size simulations like ours .",
    "in principle one could use empirical relations of the @xmath283 factor available from the literature ( e.g. israel 1997 ; bryant & scoville 1996 ) , and then convert the h@xmath0 maps from our simulations to co brightness maps .",
    "this we intent to do in future work that will also include spiral disks .",
    "nonetheless , the molecular fractions we derive here seem to be reasonable , although for the low-@xmath26/low - z simulations the derived @xmath70 is on the low side .",
    "the molecular fraction may increase somewhat for a simulation run at higher resolution , because in metal - poor environments the @xmath99 transition is taking place above @xmath284 , this can increase @xmath70 by a factor 2 - 5 . for the galaxy models",
    "run with high metallicity and/or formation rate we find quite substantial fractions of h@xmath0 , of @xmath285 .    we also seem to find quite high values , @xmath286 , of the diffuse warm neutral medium to be molecular . to illustrate this we have plotted in figure [ fg_hivsh2 ] the molecular fraction as a function of total column density for a face - on projection .",
    "there is a clear column density threshold for the presence of h@xmath0 for the low metallicity simulation . for high metallicity even low column density regions ( which are also of low density and high temperature )",
    "show fractions of @xmath287 .",
    "this state of the gas ( low density , high temperature ) is not typically associated with the presence of such quantities of h@xmath0 .",
    "there is no - or very little - formation of molecular gas going on in this gas phase and any @xmath288 present should dissociate .",
    "in fact , destruction is taking place in the simulation , but its timescales are quite long . for the thermal dissociation",
    "this is due to the low density of the gas : for temperatures of @xmath289 and density of @xmath290 the collisional destruction timescale ( for neutral gas ) is @xmath291 .",
    "furthermore , for our model galaxy the radiation fields in quiescent regions are quite low , @xmath292 , due to the low star formation , so the radiative dissociation timescales are also in the order of @xmath293 .",
    "hence the h@xmath0 survival in lukewarm gas may not be unrealistic .",
    "note however that the simulation may not represent the dispersion of h@xmath0 from dense regions realistically : molecular gas is formed in dense , star forming regions , where radiation fields are higher ( for our model up to @xmath294 .",
    "as the star formation heats the surrounding gas it will destroy h@xmath0 , the amount of molecular gas that  escapes ",
    "destruction is then sensitive to e.g. the time it is exposed to the high radiation field or the combination of high density/ high temperature .",
    "also , destruction by supernova shock is not represented very well , because the interaction of the supernova shocks with the ( sub resolution ) molecular clouds is absent . on the other hand shocks",
    "have been shown recently to also induce fast h@xmath0 formation as they propagate through diffuse hi gas ( bergin et al .",
    "2004 ) and the effect of such a mechanism in the overall hi / h@xmath0 balance in our simulations is unknown .    nevertheless , our simulations do indicate that in so far as the molecular gas is not destroyed at the sites of its original assembly , it can survive the cnm - to - wnm transition . in that case",
    "the lukewarm and wnm gas phases may still contain significant amounts of h@xmath0 . in subsequent work",
    "we intend to explore the issue of h@xmath0 survivability under such conditions more thoroughly by introducing a better model of its collisional and fuv - induced destruction in such gas phases while also including shock - induced h@xmath0 formation and destruction mechanisms .",
    "finally , any significant underlying cloud substructure in cnm hi clouds is likely to enhance the amount of h@xmath0 gas present in that phase .",
    "future applications of h@xmath0-tracking numerical models of galaxies can be divided in two broad and complementary categories , namely : a ) examine the effects of the various model parameters on the h@xmath0 distribution within a given galaxy by e.g. using different h@xmath0 formation functions ( see cazaux & tielens 2004 ) , and/or using a range of @xmath143 , @xmath295 and @xmath140 values , b ) explore the evolution of the h@xmath0/hi distribution across the hubble sequence using a single `` mean '' h@xmath0-tracking model . in the latter category starbursts / mergers , with their extreme and fast - evolving pressure and radiation environments ( and hence probably strongly varying h@xmath0/hi fractions ) provide particularly attractive templates for modeling .",
    "we presented a method to calculate the local h@xmath0 content in simulations of the ism based on a subgrid model for the formation and destruction of molecular gas .",
    "the model tracks the formation of h@xmath0 on dust grains and its destruction by uv irradiation in the cnm phase and its collisional destruction in the wnm phase including the effects of shielding by dust and h@xmath0 self - shielding .",
    "the solution to the h@xmath0 formation / destruction problem is simplified greatly by the assumption that h@xmath0 formation takes place in structures that conform to the observed density / size scaling relations , present on scales not resolved by the hydrodynamic code of the simulation .",
    "we show steady state solutions of the model for the molecular fraction @xmath70 as a function of the average gas density , temperature , velocity dispersion , radiation field , and metallicity .",
    "the effects of the cloud substructure are explored by taking @xmath296 density profiles for the model clouds , this seem to have only a modest effect on the derived h@xmath0 fractions , but it does allow more diffuse gas to be molecular .    a simple time - dependent formulation of the same model is then coupled to hydrodynamic simulations and used to calculate the local evolution of the molecular gas fraction according to the local macroscopic quantities .",
    "we have then incorporated our h@xmath0-tracking method in an n - body / sph code for the simulation of galaxy - sized objects .",
    "our first application is to model a typical low surface brightness dwarf galaxy where the demands set by the density resolution necessary to properly track the @xmath214 transition are easily met .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * we found that our model reproduces reasonable molecular fractions ranging from @xmath297 for low metallicity to @xmath298 for solar metallicity systems , saturating to @xmath255 for high values of the h@xmath0 formation rate and in the central regions of our model galaxies .",
    "* the biggest uncertainty is the value of the adopted formation rate parameter @xmath26 , however the general features of the spatial h@xmath0 distribution do not depend significantly on @xmath26 . *",
    "the molecular fraction shows a strong dependence on the metallicity z , as expected for h@xmath0 forming on dust grains .",
    "our model for a high metallicity dwarf shows surprising amounts of  diffuse ",
    "h@xmath0 , possibly due to the low radiation fields outside star forming regions .",
    "this may be analogous to what happens in the outer regions of spiral galaxies where the radiation field drops , and a diffuse h@xmath0 gas phase may be present there .",
    "however a better model for the h@xmath0 formation and destruction in the wnm phase is needed before the aforementioned results can be considered secure . *",
    "the molecular gas content is sensitive to the details of our star formation recipe , especially on the value of the delay factor @xmath205 adopted .",
    "this poorly constrained factor , generally used to parameterize a slower - than - free fall star formation timescale , needs to be sufficiently large , @xmath258 to allow for h@xmath0 formation before young stars start to dissociate h@xmath0 . on the other hand a star formation criterion based on the formation of h@xmath0 can dispense with the @xmath205 factor completely , giving local star formation rates well within constraints set by observations .",
    "this suggests that the star formation is governed by cloud chemistry processes , and indicates the importance of considering molecular gas in simulations . *",
    "h@xmath0 cooling has only a minor impact for our model .",
    "the largest effect of h@xmath0 cooling is seen in high metalicity ( and thus h@xmath0 content ) environments .",
    "summarizing , we developed an algorithm to calculate the evolution of the molecular gas phase during the evolution of the gaseous and stellar content of galaxies , and obtained a first application to dwarf galaxies .",
    "strong points are that it is simple , physically motivated and not computationally expensive .",
    "it is well suited to galaxy - sized simulations where a complete treatment of the physics involved in the formation of the h@xmath0 clouds is inaccessible , while our approach can be seen as complementary of ( much higher resolution ) simulations modeling individual molecular clouds .",
    "the set of astrophysical questions that can be addressed using such h@xmath0-tracking models is large .",
    "these include examining the influence of `` micro''-physics parameters / functions like the h@xmath0 formation rate on the general molecular gas distribution within a given galaxy , as well as modeling the gaseous ism evolution for galaxies across the hubble sequence .",
    "the latter can now be done by including all gas phases along with the stars , with the molecular phase expected to be the most intimately involved with the star formation .",
    "finally , mergers / starbursts , with their fast - evolving pressure and radiation environments are ideal templates for future applications of the model presented  here .",
    "it is interesting to examine approximate analytical solutions of eq . 12 , if only for the reason of checking the more general solution in limiting cases .",
    "this can be done for two particular domains , namely that of rapidly increasing and rapidly decreasing @xmath300 .",
    "for @xmath301 we can approximate eq .",
    "12 as    @xmath302    in the case of @xmath303 , and thus a decreasing molecular mass fraction , we approximate eq .",
    "12 as    @xmath304    hence    @xmath305    which , for @xmath173 , provides a convenient solution describing the photo - destruction of molecular clouds .",
    "here we give the corresponding equations of section 2 for clouds with a density profile @xmath306 ( `` logotropic clouds '' ) . for a radially incident interstellar radiation field , such a density profile yields      where @xmath308 .",
    "for @xmath309 we obtain @xmath310 and the transition column density of eq .",
    "b1 reduces that of eq .",
    "4 ( for @xmath311 ) , as expected , because for large clouds the density will not change much over @xmath312 .",
    "the visual extinction corresponding to this @xmath312 is given by                  where @xmath320 and @xmath102 are calculated for @xmath321 .",
    "it can be easily seen that for @xmath322 b5 reverts back to eq .",
    "12 with a density @xmath321 ( i.e. the case of a cloud with so large a radius that the hi / h@xmath0 equilibrium is well approximated by a plane - parallel geometry at a uniform density @xmath321 ) .",
    "for @xmath323 the solution of eq .",
    "b5 remains the same as in eq .",
    "12 but with @xmath324 replacing n. hence , in the case of cloud destruction and @xmath173 , eq .",
    "a3 expresses the time dependence of the transition layer also in logotropic clouds . for @xmath325 , eq .",
    "b5 is now approximated by                                                                                                                                                                                                      .",
