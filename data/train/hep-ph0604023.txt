    "single - transverse spin asymmetries ( ssas ) play an important role for our understanding of qcd and of nucleon structure .",
    "they have a long history , starting from the 1970s and 1980s when surprisingly large ssas were observed in hadronic reactions such as @xmath3 at forward angles of the produced pion @xcite .",
    "the last few years have seen a renaissance in the experimental studies of ssas .",
    "the hermes collaboration at desy , smc and compass at cern , and the clas collaboration at the jefferson laboratory have investigated ssas in semi - inclusive hadron production @xmath4 in deep - inelastic scattering @xcite . for proton targets ,",
    "remarkably large asymmetries were found .",
    "the advent of the first polarized proton - proton collider , rhic , has opened new possibilities for extending the studies of ssas in hadronic scattering into a regime where the use of qcd perturbation theory in the analysis of the data appears to be justified .",
    "the star , phenix and brahms collaborations have presented data for single - inclusive hadron production , and large single - spin effects at forward rapidities were found to persist to rhic energies @xcite .",
    "the observed large size of ssas in hadronic scattering has presented a challenge for qcd theorists  @xcite .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed  @xcite and been extensively applied  @xcite in phenomenological studies .",
    "the first relies on the use of transverse - momentum dependent parton distributions for the transversely polarized proton . for these distributions , known as sivers functions @xcite ,",
    "the parton transverse momentum is assumed to be correlated with the proton spin vector , so that spin asymmetries naturally arise from the directional preference expressed by that correlation .",
    "the other mechanism ( referred to as efremov - teryaev - qiu - sterman ( etqs ) mechanism ) is formulated in terms of the collinear factorization approach and twist - three transverse - spin - dependent quark - gluon correlation functions of the proton @xcite .",
    "a concept common to both mechanisms is the factorization of the spin - dependent cross section into functions describing the distributions of quarks and gluons in the polarized proton , and partonic hard - scattering cross sections , calculated in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "the question of which mechanism should be used in the analysis of a single - spin asymmetry is therefore primarily tied to the factorization theorem that applies for the single - spin observable under consideration .",
    "for example , for the single - inclusive process",
    "@xmath3 , there is only one hard scale , the transverse momentum @xmath5 of the produced pion , and the ssa is power - suppressed ( `` higher - twist '' ) by @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", one can prove a _ collinear _ factorization theorem in terms of the quark - gluon correlation functions  @xcite , and the etqs mechanism applies .",
    "on the other hand , the observables typically investigated in deep - inelastic lepton scattering ( dis ) are characterized by a large scale @xmath1 ( the virtuality of the dis photon ) and by the much smaller , and also measured , transverse momentum @xmath7 of the produced hadron . in this two - scale case",
    ", single - spin asymmetries may arise at leading twist , i.e. , _ not _ suppressed by @xmath8 .",
    "the relevant factorization theorem is formulated in terms of _ transverse - momentum - dependent _ ( tmd ) functions @xcite , in particular the sivers functions .",
    "we note that much progress has been made recently in understanding the underlying theoretical issues in the tmd qcd factorization .",
    "for example , the gauge - invariance properties of the necessary tmd parton distributions have been clarified @xcite for dis and drell - yan processes , and an extension to more complicated hadronic processes has been considered in @xcite .    from what we just discussed",
    ", the two mechanisms for single - spin asymmetries might appear to be essentially unrelated .",
    "however , one can make an argument that a consistent theoretical description of the ssa for a hard process over its full kinematical regime requires both mechanisms to be present and to contain the same physics in the region where they both apply . to give a specific example  which will in fact be the example treated in this paper  let us consider the ssa for the drell - yan process when the invariant mass @xmath1 of the pair as well as its transverse momentum @xmath7 are measured . we stress that we consider cross sections differential just in @xmath9 and @xmath7 , but not specifically in the angular distributions of any of the individual leptons .    at relatively large pair transverse momentum , @xmath0 ,",
    "there is only one large scale , and the ssa will be power - suppressed in that scale .",
    "this directs us to use the etqs mechanism with its collinear factorization involving the twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions and corresponding hard - scattering functions calculated at lowest order from partonic @xmath10 processes . as an aside ,",
    "when taking the real - photon ( @xmath11 ) limit , this calculation will yield the result for the ssa in direct - photon production  @xcite .",
    "we can next investigate what happens when we make the ratio @xmath12 small , keeping both scales perturbative , @xmath13 .",
    "we refer to @xmath7 in this regime as `` moderate '' transverse momentum",
    ". the etqs mechanism will still apply here ( even though the hard - scattering functions will develop large logarithms of the ratio @xmath12 that will eventually need to be resummed to all orders in the strong coupling ) . at the same time",
    ", however , the factorization in terms of tmd distributions applies now  @xcite , which involves the sivers functions .",
    "if both mechanisms are internally consistent , they must describe the same physics in this region .",
    "in a recent publication @xcite , we have demonstrated that the two mechanisms indeed provide the same description of the single - spin asymmetry for the drell - yan process in the regime @xmath14 , and that there is a direct correspondence between the sivers functions and the twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions , derived also earlier in  @xcite .",
    "the key observation is that , at moderate transverse momentum , the sivers function may be calculated perturbatively , using the twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions . in other words ,",
    "the etqs mechanism generates a non - vanishing sivers function in this kinematic regime .",
    "although there have been earlier efforts to link the two mechanisms @xcite , a clear connection , at the level of physical observables , has been established only in  @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we present details of the derivation of our results in  @xcite .",
    "our results may in some sense be viewed as establishing a unification of the two mechanisms . at large @xmath7 , the etqs mechanism applies . at moderate transverse momentum , a smooth transition from the etqs mechanism to the one based on tmd factorization occurs , with the two approaches containing the same physics . at yet lower @xmath7 ( @xmath15 ) , the tmd factorization still applies , containing in a natural way the transition from perturbative to non - perturbative physics .",
    "we believe that this unified picture should prove to be the best approach to phenomenological studies of ssas .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the twist - three quark - gluon correlation function and explain its physical significance . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the single - spin differential cross section for drell - yan production using the etqs mechanism , and we study its limit @xmath2 in sec .",
    "a comparison with the tmd factorization approach is made in sec .",
    "v , and we conclude the paper in sec . vi .",
    "consider a transversely polarized proton traveling at nearly the speed of light .",
    "its internal color electric and magnetic fields then have preferred orientations in the plane transverse to the proton s direction of motion . by parity invariance",
    ", the color electric field must be orthogonal to the spin of the proton .",
    "if averaged over the proton wave function , the field vanishes because the proton is color - neutral ( and also because of time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "however , if one multiplies the color field with the quark color current , the average may be non - zero .",
    "this average defines a quark - gluon correlation function that characterizes a property of a polarized proton . in some sense",
    ", the correlation describes how strongly polarized the color electric field is in a spinning proton .    in this paper , we are mostly interested in the so - called light - cone correlations . for these",
    ", quark and/or gluon fields are separated along the light - cone direction @xmath16 ( if @xmath17 denotes a space - time coordinate , the light - cone variables are defined as @xmath18 ) .",
    "it is the light - cone correlations that characterize the structure of the proton in high - energy scattering .",
    "one finds the following expression for the spin - dependent quark - gluon correlation described above  @xcite : @xmath19 visualized by the diagram in fig .  1 .        here",
    ", @xmath20 is the proton state with four - momentum @xmath21 and transverse - polarization vector @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the quark fields with color indices @xmath25 and dirac indices @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the gluon field strength tensor with octet color index @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the fractions of the proton s light - cone momentum carried by the quarks and the gluon , where their momenta as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath32 is the light - cone gauge link , @xmath33 which makes the correlation operator gauge - invariant .",
    "note that our sign convention for the strong coupling constant @xmath34 follows from @xmath35 for the covariant derivative .",
    "also note that we have included a factor @xmath34 in the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ phidef ] ) , as compared to the definition in  @xcite . in the second line of ( [ phidef ] ) , we have expanded the matrix in dirac space , keeping only the leading , twist - three , term that contributes to the ssa in the drell - yan process , and neglecting contributions of yet higher twist . here , @xmath36 is the number of colors , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denote the generators of the su(3 ) color gauge group . @xmath39 is the 2-dimensional levi - civita tensor with @xmath40 .",
    "inverting eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we can express the correlation function @xmath41 as follows : @xmath42 where the sums over color and spin indices are now implicit and , for simplicity , we have omitted the gauge link which vanishes if one chooses to work in the light - cone gauge , @xmath43 .",
    "note that we have suppressed a renormalization scale dependence of @xmath44 .",
    "equation  ( [ tdef ] ) provides the normalization for our calculations in the following sections . because of parity and time - reversal invariance , the correlation function has the symmetry property  @xcite @xmath45 which will be used later on to simplify our results .",
    "we shall now calculate the single - transverse - spin dependent cross section for the drell - yan process , using the etqs mechanism .",
    "we will first perform the calculation of the cross section at parton level .",
    "convolution with the twist - three correlation function introduced in the last section and with the usual feynman parton distributions for the unpolarized proton will then give the physical hadronic cross section .",
    "we shall limit ourselves to a situation where the dominant contributions come from the twist - three correlation function for a _ valence quark _ , and from an anti - quark or gluon of the unpolarized proton . in this way",
    ", we do not need to worry , for example , about other types of twist - three correlation functions , such as purely gluonic ones @xcite . in an actual experiment ,",
    "such a situation may be realized when the lepton pair is produced in the forward direction of the polarized beam ( at large rapidity ) , so that large momentum fractions in the polarized proton are probed .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , we are primarily interested here in the drell - yan pair produced at large transverse momentum @xmath0 . for this to happen",
    ", a quark or gluon jet must be produced in the hard partonic process against which the drell - yan pair recoils . in the unpolarized case , to lowest order in perturbation theory , there are two partonic subprocesses of this kind : the compton - type quark - gluon scattering @xmath46 , and quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath47 .",
    "one therefore arrives at the following lowest - order ( lo ) expression of the unpolarized drell - yan cross section for producing a virtual photon of invariant mass @xmath1 , rapidity @xmath48 , and transverse momentum @xmath7 : @xmath49\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\,\\times\\delta(\\hat s+\\hat t+\\hat u - q^2 ) \\label{sigunp } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the strong coupling constant , and @xmath51 with the electromagnetic coupling @xmath52 and the hadronic center - of - mass energy squared @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the partons momentum fractions , and the partonic mandelstam variables are defined as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 with the virtual photon momentum @xmath59 . note that we have omitted the scale dependence of the parton distributions , as we will do throughout this paper .     and ( b ) @xmath60 ; ( c ) a typical diagram , from the interference of the amplitudes in ( a ) and ( b ) , that gives a contribution to the ssa._,height=188 ]    in order to have a non - vanishing single - transverse - spin asymmetry in a hadronic process , an interference of two amplitudes with different strong - interaction phases is required .",
    "when the underlying scattering mechanism is hard , as is the case for our drell - yan observable at large @xmath1 and @xmath7 , the difference in strong interaction phase may arise from the interference between a real part of the scattering amplitude in fig .",
    "2(a ) and an imaginary part of the partonic scattering amplitude with an extra gluon in fig .",
    "the interference of these two amplitudes corresponds to the typical diagram contributing to the ssa shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) . the additional gluon of momentum @xmath61 from the polarized proton , which leads to the twist - three quark - gluon correlation function as shown in fig .  1",
    ", can attach to any propagator of the hard part represented by a light circle in fig .",
    "2(b ) or ( c ) .",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude with an extra gluon is provided by the pole of the parton propagator associated with the integration of the gluon momentum fraction @xmath30  @xcite . in the previously considered cases of the ssas in direct - photon or inclusive - hadron production",
    ", such poles only occur when the additional polarized gluon has a vanishing momentum , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , while it is attached to an external on - shell parton  @xcite .",
    "these poles were referred to as `` soft poles '' @xcite .",
    "for example , if the polarized gluon attaches to the incoming unpolarized anti - quark , the on - shell propagation of the anti - quark line will generate such a soft and un - pinched gluonic pole .",
    "however , for the drell - yan process , there are two observed hard scales , @xmath1 and @xmath7 , because of the outgoing photon being off - shell , and there could be additional imaginary contributions associated with poles of propagators in the partonic scattering amplitude for which @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "such poles were called `` hard poles '' @xcite . in the calculations presented below",
    ", we shall consistently include both contributions , soft - pole and hard - pole ones .",
    "compared to the unpolarized case in eq .",
    "( [ sigunp ] ) , we now find the following structure for the lo single - spin cross section : @xmath66\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\,\\delta(\\hat s+\\hat t+\\hat u - q^2 ) \\ , \\label{quarkform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the soft- and hard - pole contributions for scattering off an unpolarized anti - quark or gluon , respectively .",
    "each of these will be a function of the partonic mandelstam variables , of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and of the twist - three quark - gluon correlation function @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath54 is the same as in the unpolarized case , determined in terms of the external hadronic variables through the delta - function in  ( [ quarkform ] ) .",
    "as will be described in detail below , @xmath70 and @xmath71 depend on @xmath54 and are fixed by the on - shell conditions set variously by the soft and hard poles , and by that for the unobserved final - state parton in the hard process .    in the following subsections",
    ", we will first discuss the generic features of the soft and hard poles , and then present their respective contributions to the single - transverse polarized cross sections for the quark - antiquark and quark - gluon scattering channels .",
    "-0.7 cm    we will take the diagrams shown in fig .  3 as examples of how the soft and hard poles arise .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the momentum of the incident anti - quark , @xmath73 that of the initial quark to the left of the cut , @xmath74 that on the right , and @xmath75 the momentum of the polarized gluon attaching to the hard part .",
    "this attachment may happen on the left side of the cut , as shown in fig  3(a ) , or on the right side as in 3(b ) . in order to analyze the pole structure in the scattering amplitudes , it is convenient to consider only the dominant components of the relevant momenta .",
    "for example , @xmath72 may be chosen to only have a light - cone `` minus '' component , while @xmath73 and @xmath74 are then dominated by their plus components .",
    "when the polarized gluon attaches to the left side of the cut in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we find that the on - shell condition for the gluon radiated into the final state fixes @xmath76 ( or , equivalently , @xmath71 ) to be @xmath77 , while @xmath78 ( @xmath70 ) is determined by the ( soft- or hard- ) pole condition . on the other hand , the momentum flow in fig .",
    "3(b ) is opposite : @xmath70 is determined by the on - shell condition for the outgoing gluon , and @xmath71 by the pole of a propagator .    in fig .  3 , we have denoted the poles by bars , and introduced the labels @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the soft and hard poles , respectively .",
    "a soft pole arises in fig .",
    "3(a ) on the anti - quark line carrying momentum @xmath81 , because we have @xmath82 which provides a phase proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the quark - gluon correlation function @xmath69 will be probed when both of its arguments are identical . after combining with the on - shell condition for the unobserved final - state gluon , one finds in fact that the contribution enters with @xmath84  . ] .",
    "similarly , the soft pole in fig .",
    "3(b ) will arise through @xmath85 so that it enters with opposite sign compared to that of fig .",
    "3(a ) , but with otherwise the same quark - gluon correlation function . therefore , the contributions by the two poles in eqs .",
    "( [ 3a]),([3b ] ) may be combined .",
    "next , we turn to the hard pole in fig",
    ".  3(a ) .",
    "it occurs when the quark propagator carrying momentum @xmath86 goes on mass - shell .",
    "the propagator reads @xmath87 where we have neglected the transverse momentum @xmath88 .",
    "it is easy to see that this propagator has a pole at @xmath89 , corresponding to @xmath90 , where @xmath91 because @xmath92 , this pole is not forbidden kinematically .",
    "furthermore , @xmath93 , which is the reason why we refer to the pole as `` hard '' . after taking the pole , we find @xmath94 . using the on - shell condition for the outgoing gluon , the associated twist - three correlation eventually is @xmath95 , different from that for the soft - pole contributions . likewise , the hard pole in fig .",
    "3(b ) arises from the propagator @xmath96 and is at @xmath97 , corresponding to @xmath98 .",
    "the associated twist - three quark - gluon correlation function becomes @xmath99 .",
    "because of the symmetry property  ( [ symm ] ) of the function , we have @xmath100 , and we may again combine the contributions from the two sides of the cut in the diagram .    from kinematics , we find that hard poles only arise from @xmath101-channel propagators , and only on the side of the diagram that contains the additional gluon from the polarized proton . for each diagram , we have to include all contributions by the soft and hard poles , in order to obtain the complete result .",
    "although we will calculate their contributions separately , the soft and hard poles do overlap in some kinematical regions , for example , when the transverse momentum @xmath7 is much smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "we will discuss this more in sec .",
    "iv .      in this subsection",
    ", we calculate the soft gluonic pole contributions to the single - transversely - polarized drell - yan cross section in the lo quark - antiquark and quark - gluon scattering channels .",
    "the calculation is rather similar to that performed for direct - photon production in ref .",
    "@xcite , except for the fact that the photon is now virtual .",
    "we start by recalling the unpolarized hard - scattering function for the subprocess @xmath102 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ sigunp ] ) : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the color - factor and the partonic mandelstam variables are as defined after eq .",
    "( [ sigunp ] ) at the beginning of this section .",
    "-0.7 cm    for the single - spin cross section in this channel , there are eight partonic diagrams possessing soft poles .",
    "four of them are shown in fig .",
    "4 , and the other four are obtained by attaching the polarized gluon in the same way on the right side of the cut .",
    "other attachments of the polarized gluon either do not give a soft pole , or simply cancel after summing over cuts .",
    "it is useful to recapitulate some of the key steps in calculating the diagrams in fig .",
    "we perform our calculations using a covariant gauge .",
    "the polarized gluon is associated with a gauge potential @xmath105 , and one of the leading contributions comes from its component @xmath106 .",
    "the gluon s momentum is dominated by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the longitudinal momentum fraction with respect to the polarized proton .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath109 flows through the perturbative diagram and returns to the polarized proton through the quark lines .",
    "the contribution to the single - transverse - spin asymmetry arises from terms linear in @xmath109 which , when combined with @xmath106 , yield @xmath110 , a part of the gauge field strength tensor @xmath111 . in order to compute this contribution , we expand the partonic scattering amplitudes in terms of @xmath109 up to the linear term . one important contribution to",
    "the @xmath109 expansion comes from the on - shell condition for the outgoing unobserved quark , whose momentum depends on @xmath109 . as was shown in  @xcite , this leads to a term involving the _ derivative _ of the correlation function @xmath44 . apart from this contribution , the @xmath109 expansion of the propagators and the dirac traces yields a term proportional to the correlation function itself .",
    "this is the so - called non - derivative term .",
    "the sum of the soft - pole contributions by the diagrams in fig .",
    "4 and their `` mirror images '' gives the function @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( [ quarkform ] ) .",

    "again we start by giving the hard - scattering function for the unpolarized case : @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",

    ", we obtain the direct - photon cross section , which was calculated previously in  @xcite .",
    "we agree with the derivative term found there , but find a difference for the non - derivative one .",
    "in this subsection , we will calculate the hard - pole contributions to the single - spin cross section .",
    "the calculational procedure is similar to that for the soft - pole contributions in the previous subsection .",
    "we will again discuss the quark - antiquark and quark - gluon channels separately .",
    "-0.7 cm    in fig .",
    "6 we show the hard - pole diagrams for the quark - antiquark scattering channel , again omitting the `` mirror '' diagrams . as discussed in subsection iii.a , only @xmath101-channel propagators give a hard pole . in the quark - antiquark scattering channel , there are only two basic diagrams containing a @xmath101-channel propagator , shown in figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( d ) .",
    "however , because of gauge invariance , we need to allow all possible gluon attachments in these diagrams .",
    "we thus have attachments to the initial antiquark line , to the outgoing gluon line and to the @xmath101-channel quark propagator , as shown in the figure .",
    "therefore , including the diagrams with gluon attachments on the right side of the cut , there will be a total of twelve diagrams containing hard poles in the quark - antiquark scattering channel .",
    "we may group their contributions into two color structures : @xmath126 for diagrams ( a ) and ( d ) , and @xmath127 for diagrams ( c ) and ( f ) .",
    "the first color factor is the same as for the soft gluonic pole diagrams .",
    "the color traces for diagrams ( b ) and ( e ) can be decomposed into these two color structures , and combined with ( a , d ) and ( c , f ) , using the fact that @xmath128 .",
    "the expansion in @xmath109 for the hard - pole contributions is somewhat more complicated than for the soft - pole ones , because the position of the hard pole itself depends on @xmath109 .",

    "6(a ) , for which a hard pole arises from the propagator @xmath129 where we have kept the full dependence on the transverse momentum . in the @xmath109-expansion ,",
    "the @xmath88 term in the above denominator will make a contribution to the term linear in @xmath109 , because @xmath130 .",
    "this will lead to a derivative term ( of @xmath44 ) , similar to the double - pole contributions found in  @xcite for the ssa in single - inclusive hadron production . in the calculation of this derivative term",
    ", we may set @xmath131 everywhere else in the scattering amplitude . because all the propagators with hard poles in fig .",
    "6 are @xmath101-channels and hence have the same momentum , namely @xmath86 , the expansion will be the same for all diagrams , and we may add their contributions . after summing over all the diagrams , we find that the total derivative contribution vanishes .",
    "more precisely , the derivative contributions from the hard poles in diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) and ( e ) ( which all contain the color structure @xmath132 ) cancel each other , and the same happens for the contributions by diagrams ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) and ( f ) ( which enter with @xmath127 ) .",
    "the expansion of the delta function associated with the on - shell condition for the outgoing unobserved gluon ( @xmath133 ) also contributes to the derivative term for each individual diagram .",
    "however , after summing over all diagrams , again the net derivative contribution vanishes . in summary",
    ", we do not have any derivative contributions originating from the hard poles .",
    "for the non - derivative contributions , we need to do an expansion of the numerator ( for example , the dirac trace ) and of the other propagators in the squared amplitude . apart from that ,",
    "the derivative terms just discussed will make contributions to the non - derivative pieces .",
    "our way of dealing with the non - derivative contributions is to first evaluate the scattering amplitudes with their full dependence on @xmath109 , and then to use the on - shell condition for the outgoing unobserved gluon and the hard - pole condition , in order to fix the light - cone momentum fractions of the quarks including their dependence on @xmath109 .",
    "for example , the on - shell condition for @xmath134 in fig .",
    "6(a ) determines the value for @xmath76 : @xmath135 similarly , the hard - pole condition @xmath136 fixes the value for @xmath78 as @xmath137 from the above equations , we see that both @xmath78 and @xmath76 depend on @xmath109 , so that their expansion will contribute to a non - derivative term .    summing over all the contributions by the diagrams in fig .  6 and their `` mirror images '' ,",

    "this large logarithm will be present in higher orders , with two additional powers of the logarithm at every new order in perturbation . in order to have a reliable theoretical calculation",

    "<S> we study the single - transverse spin asymmetry for the drell - yan process . we consider production of the lepton pair at large transverse momentum , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the pair s mass . </S>",
    "<S> the spin asymmetry is then of higher twist and may be generated by twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions . expanding the result for @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> we make contact with the transverse - momentum - dependent qcd factorization involving the so - called sivers functions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two mechanisms , quark - gluon correlations on one hand and the sivers effect on the other , contain the same physics in this region . </S>",
    "<S> this ties the two together and imposes an important constraint on phenomenological studies of single transverse spin asymmetries . </S>"
