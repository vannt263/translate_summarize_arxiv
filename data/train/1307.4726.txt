    ", we can transform this embedded open book decomposition into an abstract version @xmath336 with @xmath69 and @xmath369    the legendrian surgery on @xmath72 along the stabilization @xmath54 yields a contact structure @xmath370 on the 3-manifold @xmath371 , which is supported by the open book decomposition @xmath45 with @xmath69 and @xmath372    by lemma  [ lemma_combinatorial ] , any positive factorization of @xmath26 has to be the product of @xmath373 , @xmath374 , @xmath298 , @xmath375 , @xmath376 , @xmath298 , @xmath377 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , where @xmath181 and @xmath182 enclose the same set of holes as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "we claim that @xmath182 is isotopic to the twist knot @xmath48 .",
    "there is an element @xmath379 which sends @xmath181 to @xmath33 .",
    "we denote @xmath380 by @xmath381 . according to the proof of theorem  [ theorem_factorization_of_mapping_class ] , the given monodromy @xmath26 has at most two different positive factorizations , up to a global conjugation , depending on the two choices for @xmath221 .",
    "both of the two choices of @xmath221 are isotopic to the twist knot @xmath48 .",
    "so @xmath182 is isotopic to the twist knot @xmath48 .",
    "we compute the page framing of @xmath382 in the open book decomposition @xmath383 to this end , we compute the linking number of @xmath381 and its push - off in the page of open book decomposition @xmath384 shown in figure  [ fig : embedded_open_book ] . for both of the two choices of @xmath221 , it is routine to check that the linking numbers of @xmath381 and its push - off in the page are @xmath324 .",
    "so @xmath382 has page framing @xmath324 with respect to the seifert framing .",
    "since @xmath182 is not null - homologous in @xmath21 , we can legendrian realize it . according to the definition of open book decomposition , we know that the thurston - bennequin invariant of @xmath182 is the difference between the page framing and the seifert framing , that is , @xmath324 .",
    "therefore , the lefschetz fibration @xmath139 over @xmath140 , with fiber @xmath21 , corresponding to the positive factorization @xmath385 of @xmath26 is diffeomorphic to @xmath386 , with its standard complex structure , and a 2-handle attached along a @xmath387-framed twist knot @xmath48 .",
