    "the concept of nonlinear self - localization which is now emerging as ubiquitous in many highly nonlinear models , has an old historical origin . although exact localized and time periodic solutions were already known for long in special integrable models such as the sine - gordon @xcite or the ablowitz - ladik equation @xcite , these solutions were nongeneric because they could not survive under most perturbations of the models .",
    "landau was probably the first physicist who pioneered the concept of nonlinear localization when he found in 1933 that very generally a quantum electron strongly coupled to a polarizable medium could localize in a potential well created self - consistently and then form a polaron@xcite .",
    "actually , the concept of breathers appeared implicitly in many fields in physics but without its generality and terminology .",
    "as a unique example , it is straightforward to reinterpret in terms of breathers the old well - known josephson junction ( jj ) effect between two superconductors . in the undamped limit ,",
    "it is described by nothing but a discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation with two sites only @xcite .",
    "then , the presence of a breather is just associated with a rotation of the phase difference between the two superconductors that is the jj effect ( the same ideas extend to jj arrays @xcite ) . despite many precursive ideas , it was only in 1988 that takeno and sievers clearly suggested that intrinsically localized modes ( _ breathers _ ) in discrete anharmonic systems should be quite general and robust solutions existing in many nonlinear models @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that the discovery of this concept is a major achievement in the recent years and should become the cornerstone of new important development in nonlinear physics with applications to a wide number of fields in physics , chemistry and biology .",
    "the first rigorous proof for the existence of breathers in a wide class of models was given later @xcite .",
    "this proof was obtained by considering first a limit where the model reduces to a discrete array of uncoupled anharmonic oscillators .",
    "then , breathers , corresponding to one oscillator moving freely , trivially exist and can be continued up to nonzero values of the coupling .",
    "this uncoupled limit which can be viewed as opposite to the integrable limit where the system is harmonic and spatially continuous , was named anti - integrable or anticontinuous @xcite .",
    "this theory also holds with aperiodic lattices which may be random , it holds for coupled rotors ( rotobreathers ) , for electrons coupled to anharmonic oscillators ( polarobreathers ) etc  @xcite .",
    "the basic principle of these proofs can be extended for proving the existence of breathers in nonsymplectic models with dissipation @xcite .",
    "it can be also extended to anharmonic models involving acoustic phonons for example to an extension of the d - dimensional version of the model described in @xcite which couples linearly anharmonic optical variables with harmonic acoustic variables @xcite .",
    "a different approach is proposed in @xcite which introduces a new type of anticontinuous limit in diatomic fpu chains where the mass ratio between the light and heavy atoms goes to zero .",
    "it can be extended to higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "these different extensions confirm how general is the concept of discrete breather , and that they can persist as exact solutions despite the increasing of the model complexity .",
    "the same theory also predicts the existence of multibreather solutions obtained by continuation from the solutions where several oscillators move at the same frequency @xcite and many of them are linearly stable .",
    "they can be clusters of a few number of breathers and then are still considered as breathers ( e.g. 2-sites breathers ) .",
    "they can also be extended over arbitrary infinite clusters .",
    "when the cluster covers all the lattice sites , the multibreather becomes just an anharmonic plane waves .",
    "they have the property that they can transport energy by phase torsion over arbitrarily complex pattern called _ rivers _ @xcite .",
    "such solutions can persist even when the lattice is _ random_. in that case , it is interesting to point out that these multibreather solution can transport energy while all the linear modes are completely localized and can not transport any .",
    "these existence proofs can be also turned into an efficient method for the practical calculation at the computer accuracy of any breather and multibreather solutions @xcite in any model where they exist ( including fpu chains ) .    at the anticontinuous limit ,",
    "the breather quantization is trivial @xcite . within the standard action - angle representation",
    ", the operator corresponding to the action of the uncoupled anharmonic oscillator at site @xmath0 , can be written as @xmath1 using standard creation and annihilation boson operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( phonons ) .",
    "the anharmonicity of the oscillator is equivalent to the fact that @xmath4 is not a linear function of @xmath5 , that is the phonons are interacting . then , a quantum breather just appears as a bonded ( or antibonded ) cluster of phonons at a given site and no phonon elsewhere .",
    "when the oscillators are coupled with some coupling @xmath6 which has to be small compared to the binding energies , a naive perturbation calculation shows that these bonded states of phonons should persist as narrow bands .",
    "their band width is proportional to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of phonons involved in the quantum breather .",
    "when @xmath8 is large , this band width becomes negligible or equivalently the breather mass infinite .",
    "such behavior is indeed observed for the dimer problem @xcite where the band width is replaced by a narrow splitting between two levels and also for the trimer @xcite .",
    "if quantum breathers are narrow bands of bonded bosons , quantum polaron could be also viewed as narrow bands of a bonded state between an electron and many bosons .",
    "quantum bipolarons are the same but with 2 electrons in a singlet state bonded to a cluster of phonons .",
    "it has been observed since several years that discrete breathers could be mobile in some models @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "mobile breathers for which the velocity can go to zero ( or at least become small ) , can be studied by continuity from the immobile breathers .",
    "this problem looks analogous to the study of mobile kinks which can be often well described with a collective coordinate as a massive particle moving in a periodic peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potential .",
    "many numerically observed features for mobile breathers at low velocity , are indeed reminiscent of those of moving kinks and for that reason , it has been proposed that breather mobility could be also related to the vanishing of some peierls - nabarro barrier @xcite .    however , it turned out that this concept can not be clearly defined @xcite at least as a straightforward extension of the standard concept .",
    "the reason is that discrete breathers are not topologically conserved objects , and belong to a family of solutions the internal energy ( and frequency ) of which can vary continuously . if a pn energy barrier could be defined with a separatrix in the phase space , it could be believed that the breather could nevertheless overcome this barrier by tuning its frequency and releasing some of its internal energy .",
    "this point has been discussed in details @xcite .",
    "this point of view is not totally convincing because it is not discussed whether this internal energy could be released .",
    "we proposed a consistent definition for a pn barrier but for the action of the breather instead of its energy @xcite .",
    "this approach could explain the formation of _ intermediate _ breathers which correspond to the intermediate extrema ( _ i.e. _ not centered on a lattice site nor in the middle of a bond ) of the peierls - nabarro action .",
    "they are indeed numerically observed in many cases and shall be discussed in another publication @xcite .",
    "we shall see here that an _ effective _ pn barrier in energy could be nevertheless defined empirically .    beside the vanishing of its pn energy barrier ,",
    "the mobility of a kink is also related to the vanishing of the frequency of a pinning ( or translation ) mode .",
    "breathers also may have internal modes which are spatially localized .",
    "unlike the pn barrier , they have an unambiguous definition which hold as well for kinks .",
    "these modes can be used for testing the breather mobility .",
    "when a breather is ( almost ) freely mobile , there are small perturbations ( namely kicks on the _ translation mode _ ) which induce its motion at slow velocity . unlike most linear perturbations which grows exponentially in time ( for unstable modes ) or remain bounded ( for stable modes ) , such a perturbation grows linearly in time .",
    "we call such kind of perturbations _ marginal modes_. in the limit of a zero velocity , the ideal breather trajectory tends to become a continuum of breather solutions ( if it exists ) . as a result , there are also perturbations which remain bounded in time and thus do not put the breather into motion .",
    "they correspond to a breather pinning mode at zero frequency .",
    "for investigating pinning and marginal modes , let us consider as an example , the standard discrete klein - gordon chain with hamiltonian :      @xmath9    which consists of anharmonic oscillators with potential @xmath10 and mass unity coupled by a nearest neighbor harmonic coupling with constant @xmath6 .",
    "let us consider a time reversible breather solution with period @xmath11 of the dynamical equation @xmath12 the linearized equation which determines the `` harmonic '' modes of the breather @xmath13 is similar to a linear discrete schrdinger equation but with a time periodic potential @xmath14 with period @xmath11 .",
    "this equation always has the trivial solution @xmath15 ( phase mode ) .",
    "integration over a period of time @xmath11 of this equation determines the floquet matrix @xmath16 which relates linearly @xmath17 to its initial conditions @xmath18 .",
    "this matrix is @xmath19 for a system with @xmath20 sites .",
    "it is symplectic which implies that if @xmath21 is an eigenvalue then @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are also eigenvalues .",
    "the linear stability of the breather requires that there are @xmath20 pairs of eigenvalues @xmath25 are on the unit circle ( we choose for convenience @xmath26 ) .",
    "the phase mode corresponds to a degenerate pair at @xmath27 .",
    "this floquet matrix is also connected to the phonon scattering by the breather @xcite .",
    "the linearly stable mode associated with an eigenvalue @xmath28 is time quasiperiodic and exhibits the series of frequencies @xmath29 with @xmath30 integer .",
    "thus , its frequency is defined modulo @xmath31 .",
    "we choose the determination @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that it is also convenient to study the equation @xmath34 which allows one to explicit the krein theory of bifurcations in simple terms and in addition , yields more informations .",
    "this is nothing but the eigenequation of the matrix of the second variation of the action expanded around the breather solution which by definition is one of its extrema .",
    "this is also the ( full ) newton matrix involved in the breather continuation @xcite .",
    "let us make a brief review of its properties .",
    "the time periodicity of @xmath35 implies that the eigenvalues @xmath36 of eq.([linear2 ] ) forms bands indiced by @xmath37 .",
    "they are @xmath38 periodic and symmetric functions of the parameter @xmath39 defined modulo @xmath38 and the corresponding eigenstates fulfills the bloch condition    @xmath40    ( see fig.[fig1 ] for an example of numerical calculation of the bands @xmath36 of eq.([linear2 ] ) ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath41 of the floquet matrix @xmath42 which are on the unit circle , are determined by the set of intersections @xmath43 of the bands @xmath36 with the axis @xmath44 .",
    "the krein signature of a pair of conjugated eigenvalues @xmath45 is defined as@xcite @xmath46 which is a conserved quantity due to the symplecticity of the dynamics . according to the krein theory , two pairs of eigenvalues",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 which collide on the unit circle may lead to an instability only if their signature is different .",
    "this criterion was reinterpreted in @xcite , where it has been shown that the krein signature of the eigenvalues @xmath45 is the opposite sign of the slope @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "thus , it is clear that a bifurcation can occur only if the two eigenvalues belong to the same band ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] ) . as a consequence , the slopes of the band ( or the krein signatures ) at @xmath51 and @xmath52 have to be different",
    ".    for a stable breather in a lattice with @xmath20 sites , there are @xmath53 bands intersecting the axis @xmath54 and one corresponding to the phase mode which is tangent to this axis at @xmath27 .",
    "when the system is infinite , there is a continuum of bands ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) which can be easily calculated because it corresponds to the spectrum of the system without breather ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "there is at least one isolated band corresponding to the phase mode and possibly some other isolated bands which correspond to spatially exponentially localized modes .      when the breather becomes linearly unstable , one of these bands @xmath36 moves and looses its intersection ( see fig.[fig1 ] between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , fig.[fig2 ] and @xcite for details )",
    "this appears on the unit circle as a collision between two eigenvalues @xmath43 and @xmath59 . at the bifurcation",
    ", we have three possible situations whether the curve is tangent to @xmath54 either at @xmath27 , or at @xmath60 or at @xmath61 or @xmath62 ( krein crunch ) .",
    "the scheme on fig.[fig2 ] shows an example for a krein crunch .",
    "another important result which comes out readily from our band analysis is that the two eigenmodes associated with the eigenvalues @xmath63 and @xmath64 are colinear at the bifurcation ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the floquet matrix @xmath16 looses either one ( @xmath27 or @xmath60 ) or two eigenvectors ( @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the space generated by the eigenvectors of @xmath16 is not the whole space .",
    "we show that the missing modes are just _ marginal modes _ which grows linearly in time .",
    "let us prove that at each bifurcation where there is a curve @xmath36 tangent from above ( or from below ) to the line @xmath54 at @xmath65 , eq.([linear1 ] ) exhibits a marginal mode .",
    "the eigensolutions of eq.([linear2 ] ) associated with the eigenvalue @xmath36 which fulfills the bloch condition ( [ bloch ] ) can be written with the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is time periodic with period @xmath11 .",
    "we assume for example that @xmath36 is tangent to @xmath54 from above .",
    "then for @xmath68 small enough , there are two values @xmath69 and @xmath70 , such that    * @xmath71 and @xmath72 * @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "since the combination @xmath75 is also an eigensolution solution of eq.([linear2 ] ) , it comes out that for @xmath76 , @xmath77 is a solution of eq.([linear1 ] ) which diverges in time proportionally to @xmath78 and thus is a marginal mode ( @xmath79 is time periodic with period @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus , at the bifurcation , the floquet matrix @xmath16 exhibits a stable eigenmode @xmath80 for the eigenvalue @xmath81 associated with a marginal mode @xmath82 which grows linearly in time . when @xmath83 and @xmath62 , the complex conjugate eigenvectors have the same properties .",
    "this property is associated with the fact that the @xmath84 floquet matrix restricted to the subspace determined by the two eigenvectors which becomes colinear at @xmath65 , has degenerate eigenvalues but only one eigenvector and thus is not diagonalizable .",
    "the marginal mode is not uniquely defined .",
    "it could be combined arbitrarily with the associated eigenmode but this is just equivalent to change the origin of time .",
    "as we pointed above , there is always a band @xmath36 tangent at @xmath54 for @xmath85 .",
    "equation ( [ linear1 ] ) exhibits a phase mode ( @xmath15 ) for any breather solution and an associated marginal mode which diverges linearly in time .",
    "the latter can be also obtained directly by derivation of @xmath86 with respect to @xmath31 and thus does not represent physically a real instability . since an excitation of this mode produces a small change in the breather frequency , it is called growth mode .      turning back to the search of pinning mode and its associated marginal mode , we have to look for the breather bifurcations at @xmath85 .",
    "a systematic analysis of the floquet matrix of the breathers can be accurately and easily done numerically with the new methods developed in @xcite .",
    "it yields many bifurcations and some of them are at @xmath27 .",
    "we just have to test numerically the effect of a breather perturbation in the direction of their marginal mode .    in the case of a spatially symmetric breather , the eigenmodes of eq.([linear2 ] ) are either spatially symmetric or antisymmetric . as a result the symmetric and",
    "antisymmetric branches can intersect one with each other without interaction ( _ c.f .",
    "_ fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the pinning mode which corresponds to a small translation of the breather , has to break its spatial symmetry and should be searched as a spatially antisymmetric mode .",
    "an example has been studied in detail for the kg model ( [ hamiltkg ] ) with a double well potential @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "more extensive numerical studies will be reported in @xcite .",
    "we shortly recall the main findings and refer the reader to this reference for the illustrating figures .    for the double well potential and a single breather at frequency @xmath88",
    ", the numerical analysis reveals that at @xmath89 , there is a bifurcation at @xmath27 concerning a spatially localized and antisymmetric eigenmode .",
    "there is a pair of isolated eigenvalues @xmath90 of the floquet matrix @xmath16 which go to unity for @xmath91 .",
    "the time reversibility of the breather solution implies that the pair of eigenvectors are complex conjugate and one is the image of the other by time reversibility .",
    "thus they have the form @xmath92 where the position component is real and the velocity component is purely imaginary . when @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "the pinning mode @xmath95 only concerns breather perturbations on the position of the particles .",
    "the marginal mode which is both time antisymmetric and spatially antisymmetric , is obtained as the limit of the normalized vector @xmath96 where @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "it contains only velocity components .",
    "when a small initial perturbation with no component on the marginal mode is added to the breather , it does not move uniformly but only oscillates . on the opposite",
    ", it will move when the initial perturbation has a component on the marginal mode @xmath99 .",
    "the breather motion appears to be the most perfect ( that is the most free of phonon radiation ) when this perturbation is a pure marginal mode .",
    "a small perturbation @xmath99 added to the initial conditions of the breather at @xmath100 , grows linearly in time as expected .",
    "actually , the breather moves slowly and the motion is uniform and persists over very long time and many lattice spacing with almost no energy dissipation .",
    "let us emphasize that this breather mobility is not related to a large spatial extension of the breather as it is usually believed at least for mobile kinks .",
    "this initial perturbation only concerns the initial velocity of the particles , which at @xmath101 are zero for the unperturbed breather .",
    "since @xmath102 is normalized , the kinetic energy added to the breather by this initial kick is just @xmath103 .",
    "it is found that the resulting velocity of this breather @xmath104 is proportional to the amplitude @xmath21 . as a result",
    ", an effective mass @xmath105 can be defined by the equality @xmath106 .",
    "when @xmath6 is close to but smaller than @xmath107 , the breather does not move but oscillates if the amplitude @xmath21 of the initial perturbation @xmath108 is too small .",
    "this is not surprising because this perturbation does not correspond to a marginal mode but to an ordinary mode although its frequency is low .",
    "however , there exists a quite well - defined value @xmath109 such that when @xmath110 , the breather starts to move . just beyond the threshold",
    "the motion is non uniform , similarly to a rotating pendulum near the separtrix . for larger kicks ,",
    "the breather moves almost non - dissipatively over very long distances .",
    "an example is presented on fig.[fig : evolx ] where a narrow linearly stable morse breather is made mobile through a kick along its pinning mode . in some cases ,",
    "the breather may dissipate phonon radiation and stop after some time . as a result",
    ", the determination of this mobility threshold can not be determined with a high accuracy but its order of magnitude is nevertheless physically significant : @xmath111 can be interpreted as the _ peierls nabarro energy barrier _ which must be provided to move the breather .",
    "it is nonzero for @xmath112 and vanishes at @xmath100 .",
    "it is undefined above ( but could be defined from another intermediate breather @xcite ) .",
    "( dashed line ) , @xmath113 ( full line ) and @xmath114 ( dash - triple dotted line ) .",
    "the on - site potential is the morse potential , @xmath115 and the frequency of the breather is @xmath116 . the unit of time is the period of the perturbed breather . ]    when @xmath6 becomes larger than @xmath107 , the breather is unstable and in principle a small perturbation @xmath108 initially diverges exponentially .",
    "however , while the amplitude of this instability is weak enough , the mobility usually remains very good .",
    "there are models for which the single breathers do not exhibit any instability threshold .",
    "thus , no pinning mode can be found for example in the kg chain ( [ hamiltkg ] ) with the quartic potential @xmath117 .",
    "all the numerical tests@xcite we did by kicking these breathers by reasonably small initial perturbations , were unsuccessful to move the breathers even by few lattice spacings .",
    "however , a good mobility can be obtained when the breather frequency approaches the phonon band edge where the size of the breather diverges .",
    "this is not surprising because it is well - known that continuous models which do have exact propagating localized solutions ( e.g. the nonlinear schrdinger equation ) , provides good approximation of the model in that limit .    in summary ,",
    "highly mobile breather ( which are not spatially very extended ) , may be found at the instability thresholds of the immobile breather .",
    "the numerical investigation of the spectrum and the eigenvalues of the floquet matrix @xmath16 allows one to discover systematically mobile breathers which are not spatially extended .",
    "the method has been applied successfully in various models including fpu chain and should work in principle for models in higher dimension .",
    "it has also been applied for finding _ mobile _ and _ small _ bipolarons in the holstein - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "although the above method allows one to find breathers which moves with almost no energy dissipation , it is not clear whether there exists exact solutions corresponding to a moving breather .",
    "let us assume that we have an exact mobile breather solutions with frequency @xmath118 moving at the velocity @xmath104 .",
    "after a time @xmath119 , the breather has moved by one lattice spacing , but since this time is generally incommensurate with the period @xmath120 of the breather , the breather phase has been rotated by an angle @xmath121 modulo @xmath38 , incommensurate with @xmath122 . after a time @xmath123 such that @xmath124 modulo @xmath38 , the breather returns to an almost identical configuration shifted by @xmath30 lattice spacing .",
    "therefore a moving breather should be viewed as a moving loop in the phase space .",
    "its trajectory is the set of trajectories generated by the initial conditions with all possible phases .",
    "such a dynamics can be described formally .    considering a dynamical system with hamiltonian @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are conjugate variables and hamilton equations @xmath128    we associate with this system , a dynamical system of loops @xmath129 where the coordinates depends not only on @xmath0 and but also on extra continuous variable @xmath130 on a 1-torus . for a given period @xmath11",
    ", we have @xmath131 for any @xmath132 which represents a ( fictitious ) time .",
    "its trajectories extremalize the extended action @xmath133 which yields the extended hamilton equations @xmath134 the corresponding hamiltonian for this loop dynamics is @xmath135 that is the action of the loop where @xmath136 is taken as the time in the initial model . for a solution of ( [ dyna ] ) , this effective hamiltonian is independent of the fictitious time @xmath132 .",
    "time periodic solutions with period @xmath11 for the single time dynamics ( and in particular the breathers ) correspond to extrema of ( [ hamilloop ] ) and are fixed points for this loop dynamics .",
    "an initial loop evolves in the phase space and in general if the system is mixing it will spread densely over the phase space ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "a mobile breather corresponds to a special solution of eqs.([dyna ] ) which returns to an equivalent configuration apart a space translation .",
    "it fulfills the skew periodicity condition @xmath137 let us note that if @xmath138 is a solution of eqs.([dyna ] ) , then for @xmath139 and @xmath140 arbitrary , @xmath141 is also solution of the same equations .",
    "this change of variable does not change at all the corresponding set of real trajectories .",
    "however , our definition for the loop dynamics requires that the new solution be periodic with respect to @xmath130 , which implies @xmath142 .",
    "the new period with respect to @xmath130 which is @xmath143 , can be arbitrary . in some sense , this is not surprising because strictly speaking the frequency of a mobile breather can not be defined .",
    "however , it is reasonable that the loop motion in the phase space be as slow as possible .",
    "@xmath139 can be optimized for that and a possible criteria is that @xmath144 be minimum .",
    "if there is a solution of eqs.([dyna ] ) which fulfills eq.([skewperiod ] ) for a velocity @xmath145 , the energy of the initial loop @xmath146 has to be constant ( i.e. independent of @xmath130 ) .",
    "it is convenient to write this solution with hull functions @xmath147 and @xmath148 which are @xmath149periodic with respect to @xmath150 , and 1-skew periodic with respect to @xmath151 ( that is @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) .",
    "we have @xmath154 . eqs.([dyn ] ) have a solution with the form @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are arbitrary phases .",
    "taking condition ( [ skewperiod ] ) into account , we have @xmath158 and @xmath159 which shows that a unique pair of hull functions @xmath160 is sufficient for describing the whole breather motion .",
    "this new form turns out to be identical to those proposed by s. flach for a mobile breather @xcite .",
    "we have no mathematical proof that such exact solution could exist , but this problem could be approached numerically with the same methods as those used for calculating non time reversible multibreathers @xcite .",
    "it consists in the application of a modified newton method for finding fixed points of the poincar map @xmath161 defined by eqs.([dyna ] ) where the period @xmath162 and pseudoperiod @xmath163 are given parameters .",
    "it is clear that as in @xcite , the newton matrix is noninvertible at the fixed point ( if any ) .",
    "we know however that these degeneracies are associated with the two arbitrary phases of eq.([hull ] ) . as for nontime reversible breathers , this problem can be overcome by using a technique of singular value decomposition which in some sense , is equivalent to discard in the newton matrix , the subspace associated with the two eigenvalues which are small .",
    "this method could converge to an exact solution , if one chooses as initial solution a good approximation of a mobile breather obtained by a marginal mode excitation .",

    "for that purpose , we just used the numerical program initially designed for non time reversible multibreather solutions @xcite ( a modified newton method ) with few line adaptations consisting in changing the time periodicity into the skew periodicity condition    @xmath169    when a _ good _ approximate solution for a mobile breather can be obtained ( by perturbation of an immobile breather with a translation mode ) , it can be used as trying solution for starting the newton process . in that case",

    "is numerically calculated and diagonalized in order to look at the stability of its fixed point .    in the case presented in fig.[fig4a ] , the mobile breather solution is linearly stable while in the second case where it is more discrete and moves slower , the mobile breather is slightly unstable .",

    "as we found , in subsection [ subsection2 ] , there are marginal modes at any breather bifurcation but only some marginal modes corresponding to bifurcations at @xmath27 can be used for making a breather mobile . what is the effect on the breather of perturbations by marginal modes which are not associated with pinning modes ? since they diverge linearly in time , they start a slow transformation of the breather which is interesting to study at longer time . this transformation may exhibit complex transitory regimes not yet analyzed in general . in some cases",
    ", it exhibits a simpler behavior which can be easily interpreted .",
    "for example , for a multibreather ( 2-breathers bonded state ) , we observed that its excitation by a marginal mode may produce a fission .",
    "the most typical case we found ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) , was obtained in @xcite for the dnls equation @xmath172 for the 2-breather state denoted @xmath173 which is continued from the solution at the anticontinuous limit ( @xmath174 ) given by @xmath175 ( denoted @xmath176 ) , @xmath177 ( denoted @xmath178 ) and @xmath179 for @xmath180 and @xmath176 ( denoted @xmath181 ) .",
    "there is an instability threshold at @xmath27 at which the marginal mode is time reversible .",
    "when at a given time , a small perturbation colinear to this marginal mode is added to the breather , this bonded state breaks after some time into `` big brother '' which stay immobile and `` little brother '' which is ejected and move quite far away before stopping .",
    "when @xmath6 is smaller than its value at the 2-breather instability threshold , a critical perturbation ( that is an energy threshold ) is needed for having the fission ( peierls nabarro energy barrier ) . since the marginal mode is time reversible , the same behavior occurs when reversing time so that we get also an elastic collision scheme where running little brother collides elastically with big brother .",
    "let us show another example of perturbation by a marginal mode .",
    "fig.[fig6a ] shows the arguments of the floquet matrix as a function of the coupling @xmath6 for another 2-breather state which also consist of two identical breathers in anti - phase separated by 3 sites . the lattice is a kg chain with the lennard - jones on - site potential @xmath182 .",
    "this configuration is linearly stable for small coupling but a krein bifurcation occurs at @xmath183 ( the circle on fig.[fig6a ] ) .    a small excitation of this 2-breather by the associated marginal mode leads , after a long time ( about 3000 periods of the unperturbed breathers , see fig.[fig6]a ) to a sudden fusion of the excitations .",
    "the resulting breather contains 75% of the total energy and is mobile .",
    "its erratic motion is due to the radiation emited during the fusion .    .",
    "the norm of the perturbation is @xmath184 .",
    "( a ) is a contour plot of the energy density versus time , ( b ) and ( c ) show the initial and final energy density . ]",
    "these numerical studies are currently developed .",
    "in summary , we have shown the existence of a marginal mode growing linearly in time at any instability threshold .",
    "the existence of such a mode is a necessary condition ( although not sufficient ) for having a highly mobile breather and this condition is _ not _ necessarily related to large spatial breather extension as often believed .",
    "this criteria provides a systematic numerical method for testing breather mobility and then for finding easily in many models , spatially narrow breathers which are well mobile .",
    "in addition , an improved newton method allows to find numerically `` exact '' mobile breathers with an accuracy only limited by the computer precision . actually , these mobile solutions have an infinite tail as the nanopterons which suggests that generally a strictly localized breather can not propagate without radiating energy ( but in some case this radiation can be extremely weak )",
    ".    the marginal modes , appearing at any instability threshold , do not necessarily correspond to breather mobility .",
    "we found examples where excitation by a marginal mode produces the fission of a two breather bonded state .",
    "there are also examples where two colliding breathers merge into a bigger one ( _ i.e. _ a breather fusion ) .",
    "let us also quote that the inelastic interaction of weak amplitude phonons with breathers discovered in @xcite , can be viewed as a breather spallation .",
    "our studies presented here or in the related references , concerns classical models . however , this series of phenomena are reminiscent of chemical or nuclear reactions .",
    "this should not be surprising when thinking about the quantized version of these phenomena .",
    "breathers are bonded ( or antibonded ) clusters ( `` molecules '' or `` nuclei '' ) of @xmath30 interacting particles which are bosons ( physically , these bosons are `` phonons '' ) .",
    "their classical stability depends on the breather amplitude or frequency , that is in the quantum representation of the number of bosons bonded together .",
    "thus , depending on the model we may have stable quantum breathers for some values of @xmath30 and unstable ones for other values . actually , in translationally invariant models , these breathers form bands but their effective mass may be very high when they are not mobile .",
    "if this breather gets a high mobility , its effective mass should drop drastically .",
    "it is also not surprising that these molecule could react with a chemistry which of course highly depends on the choice of the boson interactions that is on the anharmonic potentials of the model .    finally , let us note that arrays of very resistive josephson junction ( which can be modeled by the dnls equation ) are likely the simplest systems where these ideas on breather propagation and reactivity could be developed and tested experimentally almost directly ."
