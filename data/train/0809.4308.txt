    "understanding the detailed structure of the nucleon remains one of the central problems of the strong nuclear interactions .",
    "this is particularly challenging in the so - called transition region at momentum scales @xmath2  gev , where neither perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) nor effective hadronic theories provide adequate descriptions of physical observables .    over the past few years",
    "one of the fascinating developments in the study of this transition has been the phenomenon of quark - hadron duality in inclusive electron ",
    "nucleon ( and nucleus ) scattering . here",
    "the structure functions in the region dominated by low - lying resonant excitations of the nucleon are found to closely resemble , on average , the deep inelastic structure functions describing the high - energy cross section @xcite . since qcd at high energy and momentum transfers",
    "can be treated perturbatively , but is highly nonperturbative at low energies where hadronic degrees of freedom are prominent , this duality provides an intimate link between the two regimes .",
    "recent experiments have sought to quantify quark - hadron duality by determining its flavor , spin , and nuclear dependence , while theoretical endeavors have attempted to understand its dynamical origin from a more fundamental basis ( for a review see ref .",
    "in particular , even from simple quark model arguments one expects intriguingly different behaviors of duality for the proton and for the neutron @xcite .",
    "while duality for the proton has been tested to rather good accuracy in recent measurements , for both unpolarized and polarized scattering @xcite , there is almost a complete absence of analogous empirical information on the neutron .",
    "this lack of knowledge has prevented the various theoretical models from being adequately tested , and has impeded progress in unraveling the microscopic origin of the duality phenomenon .",
    "the difficulty with obtaining data on neutron structure functions is of course the absence of free neutron targets . as a result one often makes use of light nuclei such as deuterium @xcite or @xmath3he @xcite as effective neutron targets , assuming that the nuclear corrections are negligible .",
    "even when nuclear effects are considered , there exist practical difficulties with extracting information on the neutron from nuclear data .",

    "a common approach has made use of the so - called smearing factor method @xcite , where after an initial guess for @xmath4 one iterates the solution in order to eliminate the dependence of the extracted neutron structure function on the starting point .    in practice",
    "the smearing factor method has only been applied to the unpolarized @xmath0 structure function and only in deep inelastic kinematics @xcite .",
    "the robustness of this procedure is guaranteed only for functions which do not change sign , and for spin - dependent structure functions , which can have several zeros , the usual prescription is inadequate .",
    "furthermore , in the nucleon resonance region , where there exists non - trivial resonant structure , it is not _ a priori _ clear whether it is even possible to extract resonance structure that has been smeared out by nucleon fermi motion .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method in which the nuclear effects are parameterized via an additive correction to the free nucleon structure functions .",
    "in contrast to the more common multiplicative method , which is problematic for structure functions with zeros , the new method can be used for functions of almost arbitrary shape , which allows access to neutron structure in both the deep inelastic and resonance regions . by iterating the solution ,",

    "in practice , errors on @xmath58 are much larger than those on @xmath184 , and smearing @xmath184 renders the proton errors negligible compared to the deuteron errors .",

    "this was repeated for 50 trials and the average and standard deviation computed as before .",
    "the extracted neutron data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : g1data ] are found to be in excellent agreement with the input @xmath186 structure function .",
    "the errors on the extracted neutron function after one iteration are of the same order of magnitude as those on the deuteron .",
    "note that the extracted error bars are considerably smaller than the original error bars , indicated by the shaded band around the input @xmath186 , which is mostly due to the fact that , as a sum of smeared functions , the simulated @xmath58 has artificially small errors . for real data , errors on the deuteron and proton structure functions are given , and neglecting the errors on @xmath184 with respect to @xmath58 is a very reasonable assumption .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new method which allows the reliable extraction of neutron structure functions , both spin - averaged and spin - dependent , over a wide range of @xmath5 .",
    "we have compared the new ( additive ) method to the existing ( multiplicative ) extraction method , and found that the performance of both methods is very similar for the extraction of @xmath4 , while the additive method is free of the singularities that develop when attempting to extract @xmath186 using the multiplicative method . moreover ,",
    "the speed of convergence of the additive method is nearly independent of the initial guess , and in most cases a reliable extraction is achieved after @xmath165 iterations . finally , the extraction of @xmath186 including error bars , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g1data ] , illustrates both that errors on the extracted function can be reliably estimated , and that the performance of the method is not overly sensitive to perturbations in the input .",
    "the tests of the additive method on models of resonance - region structure functions show that the general shape of the curve is reproduced after only one iteration , but that further iterations are necessary to accurately extract the magnitude of the resonance peaks .",
    "the dependence of the method on the initial guess is evident in the sense that the regions where convergence is slowest are the regions where the initial guess is farthest from the actual magnitude of the resonance peaks .",
    "thus , one can reduce the number of iterations needed with an educated guess about the shape of the neutron function .",
    "for example , since the isovector transition to the @xmath163 gives identical proton and neutron structure functions for the resonant part of the @xmath163 , a good first guess for the neutron would always be the proton structure function in the @xmath163 region . to ensure that the extracted neutron structure function is in fact correct in the context of the smearing - function model , one can smear the extracted structure function and add to the smeared proton structure function to compare with the deuteron data .    despite extensive experiments on light nuclear targets ,",
    "the neutron remains something of a mystery .",
    "the same observables which can be directly measured for the proton must be inferred for the neutron , because its instability outside of the nucleus makes neutron targets impossible .",
    "previously , the low statistics and large errors from experiments designed to measure neutron observables limited the accuracy of measured neutron structure functions far more than using a simplified model of the nucleus to perform the extraction .",
    "the situation has changed with recent experiments at jlab , and now accounting for nuclear corrections in neutron structure function extraction procedures is essential to obtain an accurate representation of the neutron structure functions , especially in the resonance region . in particular , we have shown that ignoring finite-@xmath5 corrections to nuclear structure functions leads to an extracted neutron structure function which may bear little resemblance to the true shape . to assess quark - hadron duality for the neutron to the same extent that it has been verified for the proton , detailed knowledge of all neutron structure functions in all kinematic regimes is needed . the method presented in this paper , when applied to the most recent jlab data ,",
