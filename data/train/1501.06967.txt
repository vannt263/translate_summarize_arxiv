    "quantum quench ( qq ) @xcite , referred to as how a prepared state based on the initial hamiltonian of @xmath7 can evolve with another hamiltonian of @xmath8 , provides a powerful tool for investigating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many - body systems .",
    "efforts along this line have been driven , on the one hand , by the remarkable progress in series of recent experiments @xcite with ultracold atomic gases , on the other hand , by the desire to understand the basic questions in nonequilibrium physics , ranging from thermalization and equilibration @xcite and their relation to integrability @xcite , to the introduction of new concept of dynamical phase transition @xcite .",
    "it can be said , in particular , that quenching ultracold atomic gases has becoming the forefront for studying the nonequilibrium physics .    up to now ,",
    "typical scenarios for a qq consist of a sudden change in interatomic interaction due to feshbach resonance or in the strength of confining potential @xcite , characterized by the transition from @xmath7 to @xmath8 happening over a time scale shorter than any other time scale in the problem .",
    "the key ingredient of a qq is that the final state arrived after a qq has more excitations than the corresponding equilibrium state , which in turn measures the abilities of qq driving the model system out of equilibrium .",
    "based on such a understanding , so far , most of the previous theoretical studies @xcite have focused on the ` one - off ' qq defined by a qq happens only once and subsequently investigated how the key quantities of the model system , typical of one - body or two - body correlation functions , can relax .",
    "however , the ` one - off ' qq sets a fundamental limit for the ability of driving the model system out of equilibrium , which can be best understood in terms of the loschmidt echo ( le ) @xmath9 . here",
    ", the le @xmath10 is defined as the overlap of two wave functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 evolved from the same initial state , but with different hamiltonian @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "remarkably , refs .",
    "@xcite have proved that the @xmath13 under the sudden quench is square of the adiabatic counterpart @xmath14 , which is hold in general .",
    "this gives the maximum value of a ` one - off ' qq driving system out of equilibrium to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , how to further improve the power of a qq inducing the out - of - equilibrium dynamics , which is of fundamental interest to studying nonequilibrium physics in a regime not accessible to a ` one - off ' qq , has becoming a real challenge .    here , we propose and analyze a novel kind of qq denoted to the multi - pulsed quench , wherein the hamiltonian is quenched many times , in order to further enhance the out - of - equilibrium dynamics . as shown in fig .",
    "the typical protocol of a multi - pulsed qq studied in this work consists of as follows : at time @xmath2 , suddenly quenching the interatomic interaction from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , holding time @xmath3 , and then suddenly quenching interaction from @xmath1 back to @xmath0 , holding the time @xmath3 sequence @xmath4 times .",
    "the power of our approach can be illustrated in terms of general physical arguments based on the le @xmath16 corresponding to a multi - pulsed qq .",
    "it can be proved that @xmath17 after @xmath4-time multi - pulsed quench is the @xmath18-th power of the adiabatic counterpart @xmath19 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the exponent is enhanced by a factor of @xmath4 compared to the ` one - off ' quench shows that more far away equilibrium regime can be reached . moreover ,",
    "our proposal hints at the possibility to induce the non - equilibrium dynamics in a highly controllable way .    in this work , motivated by the recent development of quenching ultra - cold atom systems in both the experimental and the theoretical sides ,",
    "we have launched systematic studies on the effects of the multi - pulsed qq on two kinds of correlation functions of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) ultracold bose gas , _",
    "i.e. _ one - body , two - body correlation functions and tan s contact @xcite of the model system respectively .",
    "the reasons are two - fold : first , these two ( one- and two - body ) correlation functions provide direct insight into the dynamical properties of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantum many - body system ; second , the one - body correlation function is directly connected with the noncondensated fraction which can be measured in time - of - flight experiments @xcite .",
    "the two - body correlation function denotes the correlation between two particles in different spatial positions at the same time and can be detected using bragg spectroscopy @xcite , noise correlations @xcite , and even by in situ measurements @xcite .",
    "moreover , we also discuss the ultra - short - range properties of the two - body correlation function , which is related to the internal energy via the ` tan s contact ' proposed by tan @xcite in the system of a two - component fermi gas interacting with a contact interaction . in more details ,",
    "we use the time - dependent bogoliubov approximation to study the non - equilibrium dynamics of a 3d bose gas after a multi - pulsed quench .",
    "in particular , by changing quench times @xmath4 , we try to collect information about how correlation functions evolve with time .",
    "we have found that the model system can produce more elementary excitations with increasing the quench times @xmath4 as expected .",
    "although the two - body correlation function oscillates fast in short - time - range , these two kinds of correlation functions tend to a constant value eventually even we increase the quenching times to @xmath21 . finally , we also find that the tan s contact changes slightly with time , which almost is independent of the quench times .",
    "the model system considered in this work is composed of a 3d bose gas of @xmath22 ultracold bosonic atoms . in addition , the interatomic interaction is assumed to be weak and can be well described by the contact interaction . in such , the many - body hamiltonian under a multi - pulsed qq in the interaction reads as follows @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the bosonic creation and annihilation operators , @xmath26 labeling the single - particle dispersion relation and @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the chemical potential and the volume of the system respectively .",
    "the @xmath29 in hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) describes the multi - pulsed quench protocol . to be specific , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we consider the case : ( i ) the system is initially prepared at the ground state @xmath11 of hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) with @xmath30 labeled by @xmath7 ; ( ii ) then , at @xmath2 , the interaction strength is suddenly switched to @xmath31 such that the time evolution from @xmath32 is governed by the finial hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) of @xmath8 ; ( iii ) after holding the time @xmath3 , the interaction suddenly quenches form @xmath1 back to @xmath0 , holding the time @xmath3 sequence @xmath4 times .",
    "we focus on the regime of weak interatomic interaction , in which hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) can be well described by the standard bogoliubov approximation . as a standard fashion",
    ", we proceed to transform the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) into the effective hamiltonian : the zeroth - order term is found by substituting all creation and annihilation operator by @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the number of condensed atoms ; the first - order term is found by keeping only one creation or annihilation operators in every term of the hamiltonian ; the quartic or more higher term can be obtained following the same logic , but we retain only to the second - order term because of the terms higher than two doing little contribution to our question were omitted . collecting all terms calculated above , we arrive at the effective hamiltonian : @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the condensed density .",
    "next , the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : effech ] ) can be diagonalized by a standard bogoliubov variational ansatz , where we write the bosonic creation @xmath24 and annihilation @xmath25 operators in new defined operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 denoting the bosonic creation and annihilation operators for noncondensed atoms , respectively .",
    "these two operators have no time dependence and always are treated as small quantities .",
    "to assure operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 still comply with the standard commutation relations for bosonic creation and annihilation operators , we have double - checked the relation @xmath40 , which is always satisfied .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : creannioperators ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : effech ] ) , we can obtain the diagonalized hamiltonian expressed by operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , at time @xmath2 , we find that coherence factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 must be solutions of the following equations : @xmath43 combined with the normalization @xmath44 , we can easily find the solutions as follows @xmath45/2},\\nonumber \\\\ v_{\\mathbf{k}}\\left(t=0\\right ) & = & -\\sqrt{\\left[\\left(\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}+g_{i}n_{0}\\right)/e_{\\mathbf{k}}^{i}-1\\right]/2}\\label{eq : cohfact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 .",
    "finally , the diagonalized hamiltonian reads as : @xmath47+\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\ne0}\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathbf{k}}b_{\\mathbf{k}}^{\\dagger}b_{\\mathbf{k}}.\\label{eq : effechb}\\ ] ]    both the one - body and the two - body correlation functions can be expressed as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "hence how to get these two factors is the core of issue .",
    "we need to work in the heisenberg representation and make use of the equations of motion for @xmath50 as follows , @xmath51\\label{eq : eq.of motion}\\ ] ] the solving process of @xmath52 and @xmath53 is straightforward but somewhat complicated , we only give a number of important steps .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : creannioperators ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq.of motion ] ) , we can get differential equations for @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath54 we can solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : partialu , v ] ) based on the initial conditions @xmath55 and @xmath56 , reading , @xmath57 where the time evolution operator @xmath58 is defined as eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolutionmatrix ] )    @xmath59    in the derivation of the expressions of the time - dependent coherence factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we limit ourselves into the regime where the time dependence of @xmath60 can be safely neglected as shown in refs . @xcite . moreover",
    ", the condition of @xmath61 can be easily obtained in the typical ultra - cold atomic experiments .",
    "using @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the multiple quench scenario ( see in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ) can be expressed as follows .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficients of @xmath62 and @xmath63 at time @xmath3 after the @xmath4-th quench can be determined as follows , @xmath64^{n}\\left(\\begin{array}{c } u_{\\mathbf{k}}\\left(0\\right)\\\\ v_{\\mathbf{k}}\\left(0\\right ) \\end{array}\\right)\\label{eq : bangbangprotocol}\\ ] ] then the one- and two - body correlation functions for @xmath4th quench protocol , according to their definitions @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67 , can be expressed as follows @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "we point out that the terms quartic in @xmath41 s and @xmath42 s arising from correlations between the noncondensed atoms are ignored because these correlations become unimportant at long distances @xmath71 nm ; in contrast , the short - distance structure of the two - body correlation will become very important .",
    "therefore , we also derive the concrete expression for tan s contact as follows , @xmath72.\\label{eq : contact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] throughout this paper we consider two typical kinds of the multi - pulsed qq : quench to a smaller interaction @xmath73 or quench to a bigger interaction @xmath74 . in both cases , the noncondensed fractions , and the equal - time density - density correlation functions , and the tan s contacts all have analytical expressions , however , they are a bit complicated , so we not list them here . in what follows ,",
    "we focus on the influence of the multi - pulsed qq on two kinds of correlation functions as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , which are plotted on the basis of their analytic expressions . in this end",
    ", we devise following two scenarios : first , we refer to @xmath75 as the times of quench in the quench protocol and then study how the correlation functions evolve with time after the quench with the different values of @xmath4 ; second , we choose the parameter regimes of both @xmath73 and @xmath74 and consider how the detailed changes of interaction affect the non - equilibrium dynamics of correlation functions .    in the first scenario ,",
    "the results are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is evident that the multi - pulsed qq can produce more noncondensed fraction with increasing the quench times of @xmath4 as expected , which suggests that more far away equilibrium regimes can be achieved .",
    "moreover , both the rapid relaxation of the one - body matrix in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and two - body correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] suggests that , after the 3d bose gas is brought out of equilibrium by a qq , it can relaxes to a steady state on a time - scale within the experimental reach . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the fact that the quench times of @xmath4 has the relative small effects on the tan s relation can be understood as follows : a qq usually induces the low - energy fluctuations compared to the energy scale which can contribute to tan s relation .    in the second scenario , as shown in the left and right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , we compare the effects of the different choices of @xmath73 and @xmath74 on correlation functions .",
    "it s clear that the more bigger is the final interaction @xmath1 , the more excitations a qq can induce as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as for two - body correlation functions in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , they will all develop the rapid oscillation matter in short - time range , and evolve to a final equilibrium state as long as the time is long enough .",
    "moreover , the oscillate amplitude decrease with increasing the quench times when the ratio @xmath73 , and will increase when the ratio @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "in summary , we first investigate the non - equilibrium dynamics of one- and two - body correlation functions in a 3d homogeneous bose gas at zero temperature following the multi - pulsed qq in interaction .",
    "our results of one- and two - body correlation functions show that the multi - pulsed qq can bring the model system far more away equilibrium regime than the ` one - off ' qq , which suggests that the multi - pulsed qq is more powerful way of studying the non - equilibrium dynamics of many - body quantum system .",
