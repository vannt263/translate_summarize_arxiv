    "when the positive noise intensity @xmath76 is increased , we observe that the stationary density @xmath48 becomes flatter ( or less spiky ) for fixed parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; see figures [ good1]-[good4 ] .",
    "thus the nonlocal integral term , due to lvy jumps in the random forcing , in the steady fokker - planck equation has a certain damping or diffusive effect .      when @xmath89 , the corresponding lvy motion is the brownian motion .",
