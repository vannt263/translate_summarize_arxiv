    "equipped with its multi - beam instrument ( arecibo l - band feed array - alfa ) the 305 metre arecibo telescope is the state of the art facility for carrying out extended blind hi surveys of large areas of sky . as part of the arecibo galaxy environments survey ( ages ) we have been using alfa to survey selected regions of the sky .",
    "these regions are centred on relatively nearby galaxies , galaxy groups or clusters ( paper i , auld , et al .",

    "our primary objective is to reach low hi column densities ( @xmath15 @xmath1 ) and masses ( @xmath16 m@xmath3 ) to discover tidal debris , isolated hi clouds , dwarf and hi rich galaxies . with this information",
    "we will be able to measure more accurately the mass density of atomic gas in the universe .",
    "there are two parts to the survey : the detailed analysis of the target galaxy , group or cluster and the discovery and measurement of galaxies detected in the surveyed volume . in this paper",
    "the nearby object is the ngc7448 galaxy group and we survey an area of approximately @xmath17 sq deg out to a velocity of about 18,000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the ages is fully described in auld et al .",

    "it is clear that environment can have a dramatic effect on the gas content of galaxies .",
    "for example galaxy clusters like virgo have many galaxies that are deficient in hi compared to similar galaxies in the field ( chamaraux et al . , 1980 , haynes and giovanelli , 1986 , solanes et al . , 2001",
    "the group environment may also have an important role to play in the way galaxies evolve and what makes galaxy groups particularly interesting is that at the current epoch the majority of the galaxy population resides within them ( tully 1987 ) . due to this expected environmental effect ,",
    "groups of galaxies have been the subject of many hi observations in the past , for example see : haynes ( 1981 ) , van driel et al .",

    "( 2007 ) , chynoweth et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in an extensive study of 15 nearby galaxy groups ,",
    "haynes ( 1981 ) found 6 that showed clear signs of tidal interactions ( tidal streams ) demonstrating the influence of the group environment .",
    "in particular in the ngc7448 group van driel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found extended hi gas between the main optically bright galaxies . in total",
    "this inter - galactic hi amounted to some @xmath19 m@xmath3 of gas , 1.5 times that found within the galaxies .",
    "contrary to this , zwaan ( 2001 ) concludes , after studying five nearby groups similar to the local group , that the total amount of inter - galactic atomic gas in groups is less than 10% of that in the galaxies .",
    "clearly the true state of affairs is that the amount of hydrogen drawn out of galaxies in the group environment is quite variable , depending on the relative positions , masses and velocities of the galaxies involved .",
    "the ngc7448 group sits in the local void south of the galactic plane ( @xmath20 deg and @xmath21 deg , @xmath22 , schlegel et al .",
    "the nasa extra - galactic database ( ned ) gives a mean redshift independent distance to ngc7448 of 28.6 mpc ( redshift of @xmath23 km s@xmath4 ) , which we will use in this paper as the group distance .",
    "the very loose grouping of galaxies that may be associated with the group , from their spatial association and similarity of velocities ( 2 - 3000 km s@xmath4 ) , extends from ngc7479 in the south to ugc12350 in the north ( @xmath24 deg ) .",
    "our observations cover the central region of the group which , consists of six primary galaxies ngc7448 , ngc7463 , ngc7464 , ngc7465 , ugc12313 and ugc12321 and about 1.7 degrees to the south two other bright galaxies , ngc7437 and ugc12308 . these last two are probably group members as their radial velocities are very similar to that of ngc7448 ( @xmath252200 km s@xmath26 ) , fig",
    "ngc7463/4/5 form a compact sub - group and based on their disturbed nature van driel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) suggest that ngc7464 and ngc7465 are in the process of merging ( see also li and seaquist , 1994 ) .",
    "there is also hi emission extending from ngc7463/4/5 towards ngc7448 ( haynes , 1981 ) .",
    "it seems clear that tidal interactions are playing a prominent role in the evolution of these galaxies .",
    "understanding the consequences of the interaction though is complex .",
    "atomic hydrogen is the fuel for star formation so its removal is bound to suppress continued star forming activity , but we also know that tidal interactions can induce high star formation rates ( kennicutt et al .",
    "the ngc7463/4/5 sub - system in particular shows signs of recent star formation activity ( van driel et al .",
    "1992 ) and all three galaxies have been classified as having an ultra - violet excess ( takase 1980 ) .    in the following sections we will describe the data acquisition and reduction of ages observations of the ngc7448 group .",
    "our results include an analysis of hi within and outside the main group galaxies and the discovery of new dwarf galaxies .",
    "we consider galaxies detected in the volume in front of and behind ngc7448 and use these to derive a hi mass function and calculate a value for the cosmic hi mass density .    , to pick out the brightest sources irrespective of velocity .",
    "the image shows the brightest galaxies in the ngc7448 group .",
    "ngc7464 has the lowest velocity of 1875 km s@xmath4 and ngc7463 the highest of 2341 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the three galaxies ngc7463/4/5 are too close together to be spatially resolved by the 3.5 arc min arecibo beam .",
    "the image covers an area of @xmath27 sq deg ( @xmath28 mpc at the group distance ) centred at ra(j2000)=23 00 21 , dec(j2000)=15 09 29 , north at the top and east to the left . ]",
    "the ngc7448 group was observed over a number of months in 2009 .",
    "approximately 120 hours was used to cover an area of @xmath29 sq degrees ( 1.5 x 2.5 mpc ) centred on ra=23 00 00 , dec=15 14 00 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we used the 7-feed alfa multi - beam receiver and the wapp spectrometers to record two linear polarisations from each beam within a 100 mhz bandwidth . the angular resolution determined by the size of the alfa beams",
    "is @xmath30 arc min .",
    "we used the drift - scan observing mode , whereby the receiver is held stationary and the sky drifts overhead . with this observing technique each point on the sky takes about 12 sec to cross the beam ( giovanelli et al .",
    "twenty - five separate scans are then combined to give a total integration time of 300 seconds / beam .",
    "total power is recorded every second for the seven beams , each polarisation and the 4096 velocity channels of width 5.5 km / s .",
    "data reduction is performed using livedata and gridzilla ( barnes et al .",
    "livedata carries out bandpass estimation and removal , doppler tracking and flux calibration .",
    "various methods are available for estimating and removing the bandpass .",
    "we found that the most appropriate settings for the ages observations were to use the extended method using the median estimator .",
    "the extended method is a modification of the minmed routine that was originally used for the galactic high velocity cloud project ( putman et al .",
    "2002 ) . with this modified routine , the user loads the entire scan into memory and defines a sliding window which will define the target for which the bandpass will be estimated . for each beam and polarisation the entire scan outside of the target window",
    "is used to estimate the median value in each channel in the spectrum .",
    "the 4096-channel spectrum , made up of these median values , forms the estimate for the bandpass and is subtracted from the target spectrum .",
    "the resultant baselines were found to be acceptably flat except in the case of very strong continuum sources which produce large - amplitude standing waves between the dish and the receiver .",
    "the waves introduce a quasi - sinusoidal ripple into the baseline with a period characteristic of the light - travel time between the receiver and the dish .",
    "gridzilla is used to combine the individual spectra to produce 3-d data cubes .",
    "the gridding technique is exactly the same as for hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) so the reader is referred to barnes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for full details .",
    "the default parameter values specific to the arecibo telescope were applied .",
    "the ngc7448 cube has 1 arc min pixels and the 4096 velocity channels have been hanning smoothed to 10 km / s resolution . making a nyquist - sampled map with every beam and then median combining results in a circular beam with symmetrical sidelobes peaking at the 5 - 10% level ( minchin et al .",
    "the noise distribution is approximately gaussian with a median rms value of 0.7 mjy when measured along individual pixels .",
    "radio frequency interference introduces a constant source of man - made noise that can far exceed the system noise over certain regions of the spectrum . for this data",
    "there is constant interference at 1350 mhz ( 14620 km s@xmath4 ) and 1387.8 mhz ( km s@xmath4 ) and an intermittent source at 1310 mhz ( 8300 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "none of these affect our observations of the ngc7448 group though they must be considered when extracting sources from the extended volume behind ngc7448 .",
    "the velocity range @xmath31 km s@xmath4 was also excluded from the extended search volume due to the presence of contaminating signal from the milky way .",
    "we have checked the data calibration by comparing our hi fluxes with those given in the nasa extra - galactic database ( ned ) , using an average where there is more than one value . excluding the six galaxies in the central part of the ngc7448 group , where the hi from different galaxies is difficult to separate , there are nineteen galaxies in our area listed in ned with hi fluxes .",
    "for these nineteen we have fitted the spectra as in cortese et al .",
    "( 2008 ) using the mbspect routine from the miriad spectral line analysis package . with the exception of ngc7464 and ngc7465 ( see below ) all subsequent hi parameters described in this paper have been obtained in this same way .",
    "given the numerous different sources for the ned fluxes the comparison is reasonably good ( fig .",
    "2 ) , with a linear least squares fit giving @xmath32 jy km s@xmath4 .",
    "source has a flux error of about 0.3 jy km@xmath4 ) .",
    "the solid red line is the one to one relationship .",
    "the red dashed line is the linear least squares best fit to the data , f@xmath33=0.85f@xmath34@xmath35 + 0.36@xmath36 jy km s@xmath4 . ]",
    "the local environment can have a dramatic effect on a galaxy .",
    "for example in galaxy clusters gas can be stripped from a galaxy as it passes through the inter - galactic medium - ram pressure stripping ( gunn and gott 1972 , vollmer et al .",
    "galaxies can also be tidally buffeted as they move at relatively high speeds ( 600 - 700 km s@xmath4 ) through the varying cluster and galaxy gravitational potentials - harassment ( moore et al .",
    "significant strong gravitational ( tidal ) interactions between individual galaxies are rare in clusters because typically they are moving past each other too quickly .",
    "this is not so for galaxy groups where the group velocity dispersion is of order the internal rotational velocity of the constituent galaxies .",
    "in this section we concentrate on the six bright galaxies in the central region of the ngc7448 group ( table 1 ) .",
    "we will show that these galaxies have clear signs of gravitational interactions that have produced tidal streams and tails ( see also haynes 1981 , van driel et al .",
    "1992 ) and that a large fraction of the total atomic gas now resides in the inter - galactic medium .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have already noted how the environment can affect the way a galaxy evolves with time .",
    "we have too few group galaxies to compare our global hi mass function with that of galaxy groups , but we can compare with a galaxy cluster . also as part of the ages taylor ( 2010 ) has produced a hi mass function ( fig 9b ) for two regions of the virgo cluster covering 15 sq deg . at face value",
    "the virgo cluster mass function lacks both the high and low mass galaxies that are found elsewhere , though at the low mass end the error bars are large .",
    "although covering different regions of the virgo cluster the taylor result agrees with davies et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who also found that the virgo cluster hi mass function lacked both high and low hi mass galaxies when compared to the global hi mass function .",
    "both the taylor and davies et al .",
    "virgo hi mass functions peak at the same point @xmath37 .",
    "it is easy to understand how low mass and typically low surface density galaxies may lose their gas in the cluster environment via tidal effects , accelerated star formation and ram pressure stripping .",
    "one might expect that high mass galaxies are more robust .",
    "a flatter low mass slope compared to the global value has been confirmed by surveys of other moderately dense environments such as the ursa major cluster ( verheijen et al .",
    "2000 ) and the canes venatici region ( kovac et al .",
    "2009 ) .    we have also derived a mass function from the a1367 data ( 54 galaxies ) which is in reasonably good agreement with the global hi mass function , though at a distance of 92.8 mpc this does not extend to very low hi masses ( fig 9b ) .",
    "the a1367 data covers not only the central regions of the cluster , but also a substantial part of the outer infalling region ( cortese et al .",
    "by comparing virgo and a1367 we may glean some idea about what is going on .",
    "a1367 is currently being assembled from infalling galaxy groups ( cortese et al .",
    "2004 ) , thus explaining why its hi mass function is similar to that of the field over this mass range .",
    "cortese et al . (",
    "2008 ) also identify a number of bright a1367 galaxies that are surrounded by diffuse hydrogen , an indication that gas is being lost from more massive galaxies as they fall into the cluster potential , but this process has not proceeded as far as it has in virgo where our observations exclusively cover the more central regions . if these a1367 infalling groups are like the ngc7448 group then we already know from our discussion above that there could be as much as 2.5 times more hi outside the galaxies than inside , and this is before the cluster has exerted its influence .",
    "we conclude that the different shape of the virgo cluster hi mass function ( taylor 2010 , davies et al .",
    "2004 ) compared to that of the general field is the natural result of environmental influences .",
    "hi deficiency in virgo cluster galaxies has previously been well documented ( e.g. haynes et al .",
    "1984 ) .",
    "as stated above one of the many objectives of the ages was to see if the numbers of detected dwarf galaxies around nearby large galaxies would increase when we searched using a deep hi rather than an optical survey . if theory and observation are to agree then many more dwarf galaxies per unit volume need to be discovered ( klypin et al .",
    "if the hi mass function directly followed the predicted dark matter mass function with power law slope of @xmath38 we should expect to find @xmath39 galaxies with @xmath40 m@xmath3 for each galaxy with @xmath41 m@xmath3 .",
    "if the galaxy group hi mass function follows the same power law as that derived above for the ages sample then we would expect about 4 galaxies with @xmath42 m@xmath3 for each galaxy of mass @xmath41 m@xmath3 .",
    "this is clearly incompatible with our observations as there should be roughly 24 companions to the six central group galaxies . in this paper",
    "we have found just two additional dwarf galaxies of masses of order @xmath42 m@xmath3 in a galaxy group containing six galaxies with masses of order @xmath43 m@xmath3 ( tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with our previous findings .",
    "we have found two dwarf galaxies around the ngc7332 galaxy group ( two bright galaxies ) and just one around ngc1156 ( minchin et al .",
    "so surprisingly the galaxy group hi mass function is also not compatible with the global hi function ( see also pisano and wilcots 2003 ) . from our discussion in section 3.1",
    "we suggest that a significant fraction of the galaxies that contribute to the low mass end of the hi mass function are rather isolated and have nothing to do with brighter galaxies .",
    "these isolated low mass galaxies have `` appeared '' in our global hi mass function , but they are not found in hi mass functions constructed exclusively from group and cluster galaxies .",
    "much larger samples of hi detected galaxies are required to investigate the clustering properties of low mass galaxies compared to higher mass galaxies .",
    "the complete ages source catalogue is publicly available at the following link http://www.naic.edu/@xmath18ages/public_data.html .",
    "identifying the optical counter part to an hi source is not straight forward given the 3.5 arc min beam size and the fact that galaxies cluster .",
    "often there is ambiguity about the optical source and the possibility that more than one source is contributing to the detected hi signal .",
    "we have used ned to search for optical counterparts to our hi detections .",
    "most important , though not definitive , is both a close spatial association and a close match in velocity .",
    "51 objects in ned have optical velocities within 100 km s@xmath4 of the hi velocity and a spatial separation from the hi position of less than 3 arc min .",
    "the median difference between the optical and hi position for these galaxies is @xmath44 arc min .",
    "this is comparable with values of 0.4 and 0.3 arc min for previous ages data cubes centred on ngc1156 and ngc7332 respectively ( minchin et al .",
    "the mean difference between the optical and hi hubble velocities for these 51 galaxies is @xmath45 km s@xmath4 , so we assume that these are secure optical identifications .",
    "a further 26 galaxies have only one optical possibility from ned . for these galaxies",
    "the median difference between the optical and hi position is @xmath46 arc min , larger than the separation for the velocity confirmed sample and we can not be so confident that we have the correct optical source .",
    "all the other hi detections have numerous possible optical counterparts and without better resolution we are not able to make a definite association .",
    "one problem with this particular ages field is that the optical coverage of the area is not uniform , sdss only covers part of the field . where there is sdss data there is often a number of choices for an optical counterpart . where there is no sdss data there is often nothing listed in ned , but a clear candidate is seen when the dss image is inspected .",
    "there are just 5 objects that have no obvious optical counterpart after checking ned and dss , but all have velocities greater than 13,000 km / s and are relatively low signal - to - noise ratio detections .",
    "any one of the faint blobs in these fields could be the hi source . with the possible exception of ages",
    "j230843 + 161919 we find no hi detections that have no candidate optical analogue ( see also pisano et al .",
    "it appears that atomic hydrogen is extremely efficient at turning itself into stars .",
    "deep blind hi surveys of the sky can reveal galaxies that have gone undetected in other surveys with the added advantage of providing a redshift measurement . in this paper",
    "we have described how multi - beam data can be used to both investigate in detail a nearby galaxy group and use galaxies in the surveyed volume to make a measurement of the hi mass function and cosmic hi density .",
    "our main results are :    1 .   a large fraction of galaxy group atomic hydrogen may lie between and not within the galaxies .",
    "too few hi - rich dwarf galaxies are detected to be consistent with current models of galaxy formation .",
    "3 .   if they had observed this area of sky other wide area blind hi surveys , hipass and alfalfa , would have detected only 5% and 43% respectively of the galaxies we detect , missing a large fraction of the atomic gas in this volume .",
    "the global hi mass function is different to that of groups and evolved clusters ; 5 .",
    "we measure a comparatively steep low mass slope to the global hi mass function of @xmath47 ; 6 .",
    "our measured cosmic density of atomic hydrogen is @xmath48 h@xmath13 7 .",
    "we infer a cosmic hi density a factor of 1.7 times higher than that found by hipass .",

    "<S> in this paper we describe results from the arecibo galaxy environments survey ( ages ) . </S>",
    "<S> the survey reaches column densities of @xmath0 @xmath1 and masses of @xmath2 m@xmath3 , over individual regions of order 10 sq deg in size , out to a maximum velocity of 18,000 km s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> each surveyed region is centred on a nearby galaxy , group or cluster , in this instance the ngc7448 group . </S>",
    "<S> galaxy interactions in the ngc7448 group reveal themselves through the identification of tidal tails and bridges . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath5 times more atomic gas in the inter - galactic medium than in the group galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we identify five new dwarf galaxies , two of which appear to be members of the ngc7448 group . </S>",
    "<S> this is too few , by roughly an order of magnitude , dwarf galaxies to reconcile observation with theoretical predictions of galaxy formation models . </S>",
    "<S> if they had observed this region of sky previous wide area blind hi surveys , hipass and alfalfa , would have detected only 5% and 43% respectively of the galaxies we detect , missing a large fraction of the atomic gas in this volume . </S>",
    "<S> we combine the data from this paper with that from our other ages papers ( 370 galaxies ) to derive a hi mass function with the following schechter function parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 h@xmath8 m@xmath3 , @xmath9 h@xmath10 mpc@xmath11 dex@xmath4 . integrating the mass function leads to a cosmic mass density of atomic hydrogen of @xmath12 h@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> our mass function is steeper than that found by both hipass and alfalfa ( @xmath14 and 1.33 respectively ) , while our cosmic mass density is consistent with alfalfa , but 1.7 times larger than found by hipass .    </S>",
