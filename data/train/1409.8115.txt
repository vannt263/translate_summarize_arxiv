    "considering the astonishing agreement between its predictions and the experimental data , the standard model ( sm ) is up to now the best theory we have to understand the properties and interactions of the elementary particles .",
    "however very high precision measurements establish a strong test of the sm predictions , leading us to consider quantum corrections that can not be disregarded more . measuring the magnetic moments of elementary particles , especially of the muon ,",
    "is one of the best examples of how to investigate new physics that can account for the experimental data .",
    "the dirac equation predicts that the magnetic dipole moment @xmath4 of a spin @xmath5 particle such as the muon is given by :    @xmath6    with gyromagnetic ratio @xmath7 .",
    "loop - level corrections generate little deviations from 2  the anomalous magnetic moment , parametrized by @xmath8 . within the standard model framework",
    "this deviation can be precisely predicted and it is generally divided into three parts , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the qed correction , which is by far the dominant contribution in the sm , includes all photonics and leptonics loops . starting with the @xmath10 schwinger contribution",
    ", it has been computed through 4 loops and estimated at the 5-loops@xcite .",
    "loop contributions involving heavy @xmath11 , @xmath12 or the higgs particle are labeled as @xmath13 and are suppressed by at least a factor @xmath14 .",
    "the hadronic contributions are associated with quarks and gluons loops and can not be calculated by first principles .",
    "+ the @xmath15 has been measured reaching the level of 0.54 ppm .",
    "the present difference @xmath16 yields a @xmath17 discrepancy@xcite , suggesting the existence of new physics that accounts for it .",
    "however the large theoretical uncertainties can overshadow the significance of this discrepancy @xcite .",
    "theoretical enhancements along with the projected experimental sensitivity for the @xmath18 experiment at fermilab possibly reach @xmath19 , enhancing the signal up to @xmath20 @xcite . +",
    "as known , there are crucial non - addressed issues such as the neutrino masses and dark matter that motivate us to extend the sm .",
    "the @xmath17 discrepancy provides a hint of new physics too , and might be accomplished in extensions of the sm .",
    "the gauge structure of a model determines how the fermions can interact .",
    "the sm electroweak sector has the group structure @xmath21 , where left - handed fermionic fields are organized in doublets and the right - handed ones , except for neutrinos , are singlets by the @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "the scalar sector consists in a higgs @xmath22 doublet , that generates masses for gauge bosons and fermions except for neutrinos . in order to have massive neutrinos and address another open questions",
    ", we must extend the sm .",
    "compelling extensions concerning the electroweak gauge sector place the right - handed fields in the same multiplet than the left - handed ones , by means of the charge conjugation .",
    "these models have a @xmath23 symmetry @xcite . as this extension",
    "does not have right - handed neutrinos , there is not a `` build - in '' mechanism for generation of neutrino masses . in order to generate neutrino masses , deviations from the former proposal , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are in the same multiplet of @xmath26 ,",
    "are required  @xcite .",
    "frameworks based on the @xmath27 gauge symmetry , called 3 - 3 - 1 for short , can provide plausible dark matter candidates in the context of higgs portal @xcite and @xmath28 portal @xcite , setting aside the direct detection controversy that has been happening regarding the low energy events @xcite , possibly explaining the galactic center excess observed in the fermi - lat data @xcite , address the dark radiation non - thermal dark matter production @xcite , and even reproducing the mild @xmath29 excess @xcite , among others @xcite .    an attempt to introduce the right - handed neutrinos in a more elegant way",
    "has lead to an extension of 3 - 3 - 1 models , namely 3 - 4 - 1 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are in the same multiplet of a @xmath0 electroweak theory @xcite .",
    "this is the kind of models we will treat here .",
    "several works have considered the muon anomalous magnetic moment in 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite , but there is lack of results in the context of 3 - 4 - 1 frameworks .",
    "our goal here is to assess whether this model is capable of addressing the excess reported in the muon magnetic moment with respect to the sm prediction , and derive robust bounds on the model in light of the upcoming g-2 experiment at fermilab .",
    "we start by briefly discussing the key aspects of this model , which are relevant for the muon magnetic moment . for extended references on this model",
    "we recommend @xcite",
    "the gauge symmetry in question is anomaly free and it yields the electric charge operator defined as @xcite , @xmath33 where ,    @xmath34      in this model , we have left and right - handed charged leptons and neutrinos in the same @xmath35 multiplet , that transform as @xmath36 . in order to avoid anomalies , we must have the same number of @xmath37 and @xmath38 multiplets , and the sum of the fermions charges must be zero .",
    "so , the quark sector consists of one generation transforming as @xmath39 , and the two others as @xmath40 @xcite . to accomplish this , we have two new quarks @xmath41 and @xmath42 with charges @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , and another four @xmath45 and @xmath46 with charges @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "concerning the right - handed quarks , they are all singlets under @xmath0 . then , the fermion content is    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the flavor index . as in the @xmath51 case ,",
    "the number of families @xmath52 must be divisible by the number of color degrees of freedom ( @xmath53 ) , the simplest alternative being @xmath54 .",
    "hence , @xmath55 and @xmath56      in order to generate masses for the quarks the following scalar multiplets are introduced : @xmath57    the spontaneous symmetry breaking process occurs with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .    as for the charged leptons masses , they arise through terms as @xmath61 . a higgs multiplet transforming as",
    "@xmath62 has been chosen because the sextet leaves one lepton massless and the others degenerates @xcite : @xmath63    to preclude mixing among sm and the exotic quarks an extra multiplet @xmath64 has been used , transforming as @xmath65 , but with different vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath66 . concerning the neutrinos masses they",
    "are generated with@xmath67 . with those assignments @xmath0 breaks down to @xmath68 through the @xmath69 multiplet .",
    "the @xmath70 symmetry is broken down into @xmath71 via @xmath72 , @xmath64 and @xmath73 higgs .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian is , @xmath74 where @xmath75 ; @xmath76 ; and @xmath77 , give us the following muon interactions :    @xmath78\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        because of the gauge group is a @xmath79 there are @xmath80 @xmath81 , @xmath82 gauge bosons associated with @xmath35 and a singlet @xmath83 associated with @xmath84 .",
    "the physical charged gauge bosons @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 induce the following charged current muon interactions :    @xmath91                                   +   h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      after the spontaneous symmetry breaking the neutral gauge bosons mix and have a mass matrix in the basis @xmath92 given by , @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "there are four neutral gauge bosons : the massless photon , and three massive ones : @xmath95 such that @xmath96 .",
    "the lightest one is identified as the sm z boson . in principle",
    "the diagonalization procedure has to be done numerically .",
    "however , an analytic solution can be found by setting @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with @xmath99 , yielding @xcite @xmath100where @xmath101 are constants given in the appendix .",
    "the important fact is that @xmath102 refers to @xmath103 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "interestingly we find that both @xmath104 and @xmath28 give rise to sizeable contributions to the muon magnetic moment as we shall see further .",
    "for now we present the muon neutral currents ,    @xmath105    where @xmath106 and @xmath107 and @xmath108 couplings presented in the appendix .",
    "using the lhc7tev data , bounds on vector doubly - charged gauge bosons of @xmath109  gev has been placed on their masses @xcite .",
    "moreover , analyses based on flavor changing neutral currents processes that might be applicable to this model would exclude @xmath28 masses below 11 tev @xcite .",
    "the latter is still sensitive to the parametrization scheme used in the quark sector and also to the choose of what family of quarks transforms as an anti-4-plet .",
    "thus we use the former as reference .",
    "having said that , in this work our goal is to assess whether this model accommodates the muon magnetic moment and derive @xmath3 limits based on current and projected sensitivities if applicable .",
    "there are new contributions to the muon magnetic moment arising in this model , namely two singly charged vector bosons @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( fig.[feyn]c ) , a doubly charged gauge boson ( figs.[feyn]a - b ) and two neutral gauge bosons ( fig.[feyn]d ) .",
    "the corrections coming from charged and neutral scalars are suppressed because their couplings with the muon are proportional to the muon mass . hence , they are hereafter ignored .",
    "we have explicitly derived all relevant corrections to the muon magnetic moment in the appendix . in",
    "what follows , we will show the numerical results .    in the upper panel of fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we exhibit the individual contributions of each one of those particles as a function of their masses . in the lower panel of fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we show their contributions as a function of the scale of symmetry breaking of the @xmath79 gauge group .",
    "we emphasize that the latter is the most reasonable way to present individual contributions , because the scale of symmetry breaking is an universal parameter in the model and it sets the masses of the particles .",
    "we conclude from fig.[fig1 ] that the doubly charged gauge boson ( @xmath112 ) gives rise to the most relevant contribution ( see appendix for details ) . the @xmath28 and @xmath113 correction which are proportional to @xmath114 , due to the relative magnitude of the vector and axial couplings it turns out to be negative . the singly charged gauge bosons ( @xmath115 ) contribution is comparable to the @xmath28 and @xmath113 one , but positive though . in the lower panel of fig.[fig1 ]",
    "the difference between their contributions is more visible , because their masses have different dependences with the scale of symmetry breaking .        in fig.[fig2",
    "] we have combined those individual contributions , despite the insignificance of some of them , and plotted the total contributions stemming from the model .",
    "we find that the total contribution is positive as obviously expected .",
    "because the total contribution is positive the model can address the muon magnetic moment excess for a scale of symmetry breaking around @xmath116  tev .",
    "additionally , we may derive @xmath3 bounds based upon on assumption that the anomaly is otherwise resolved by any other means , using current and projected sensitivities . with current sensitivity",
    "we obtain a 3.5 tev bound .",
    "moreover , using the projected sensitive reported by the g-2 fermilab experiment which is expected to take data in the near future we exclude scales of symmetry breaking smaller than 5.5 tev .",
    "the latter is the strongest bound on the scale of symmetry breaking of this model in the literature .",
    "further data from the lhc and g-2 experiments will shed light on the matter , but it is clear the this model is a plausible explanation to the muon magnetic moment .",
    "we studied an electroweak extension of the standard model based on the @xmath79 gauge symmetry with the goal of computing the correction to the muon magnetic moment stemming from this model .",
    "we find that the doubly charged gauge boson gives by one order of magnitude the most important contribution .",
    "interestingly , its contribution turns out to be positive .",
    "hence we conclude that such model can address the muon magnetic moment excess with a scale of symmetry breaking of around @xmath116  tev , and using current sensitivity of experiments we draw a 3.5 tev bound on the scale of symmetry breaking of the model , in case the anomaly is otherwise resolved .",
    "furthermore , we estimate a 5.5 tev limit on the latter , using the project sensitive of the upcoming g-2 fermilab experiment . we emphasize that those are the most stringent constraints in the literature found on this model .",
    "dc is partly supported by the brazilian national council for scientific and technological development ( cnpq ) grant 484157/2013 - 2 .",
    "we also would like to thank farinaldo queiroz and maira dutra for useful discussions .",
    "with @xmath130 . we point out that relative difference between the vector and axial couplings for @xmath113 and @xmath28 couplings with the muon are not sensitive to the value of a and t chosen , keeping our conclusions the same . after plugging all values",
    "we find that the vector and vector - axial couplings to be : @xmath131 , @xmath132 for the @xmath28 boson , and @xmath133 , @xmath134 for the @xmath113 gauge boson .",
    "those values should be plugged in the eq.([vectormuon3 ] ) to determine the neutral gauge boson contributions to the muon magnetic moment .",
    "the diagram that contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment coming from the @xmath28 and @xmath104 particles is shown in fig .",
    "[ feyn4 ] .",
    "the contribution is given by @xcite , @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 these integrals simplify to give a contribution of @xmath138 in the limit @xmath139 .",
    "the diagram that contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment coming from the gauge bosons @xmath140 is shown in fig.[feyn3 ] which result in @xcite , @xmath141where @xmath142with @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "this simplifies to @xmath145 \\label{vectormuon6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]            we point out that the vector current of doubly charged gauge bosons vanishes because involve identical fields in agreement with @xcite . in other words , @xmath150 , and",

    "<S> we study the muon anomalous magnetic moment in an electroweak model based on the gauge symmetry @xmath0 , which has right - handed neutrinos in its spectrum , and no flavor changing neutral currents at tree level . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss relevant collider and electroweak constraints on the model , and derive the most stringent upper bounds on the scale of symmetry breaking based on the corrections to the muon magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a scale of symmetry breaking of around 2tev might explain the muon magnetic moment anomaly . in case the anomaly is otherwise resolved , using the current and projected sensitive of g-2 experiments , we rule out scales of symmetry breaking smaller than @xmath1  tev ( @xmath2  tev ) at @xmath3 level . </S>"
