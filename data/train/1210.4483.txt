    "the rapidly increasing relaxation timescales , the presence of non - exponential relaxation , as well as the violation of stokes - einstein relations between viscosity and diffusivity are some features observed close to the glass transition in glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of these features suggests that relaxation dynamics is heterogeneous , i.e. that it is faster in some regions and slower in others  @xcite .",
    "direct microscopic evidence for this behavior has been found both in simulations  @xcite and in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of dynamical heterogeneity is believed to be crucial to explain anomalous behavior of materials near the glass transition , and even possibly to explain the very presence of the glass transition itself  @xcite . despite many efforts trying to address the origin of dynamical heterogeneity",

    "however , this tool by itself can not tell us much about the origin of dynamical heterogeneity and it may be desirable to supplement it with other ways of probing the fluctuations in the system .    in this work , we test the predictions of a theoretical framework that aims to describe the slow part of the fluctuations in the relaxation dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this framework is based on the hypothesis that in glassy systems the long time dynamics is invariant under reparametrizations of the time variable  @xcite , but this invariance is broken , giving rise to goldstone modes that manifest themselves with the emerge of heterogeneous dynamics  @xcite .",

    "transverse part _ satisfying eq .",

    "altogether , we found that at the lowest temperatures , for the longest timescales and for the largest coarse graining lengths , the transverse fluctuations became stronger than the longitudinal fluctuations , which is consistent with the hypothesis .",
    "we also found that the correlation volumes of the time reparametrization fluctuations were proportional to the correlation volume of the dynamical heterogeneity , while the correlation volumes of the longitudinal fluctuations were small and independent of the correlation volumes of the dynamical heterogeneity .",
    "these observations apply to all the systems examined , regardless of the details of the interaction ( purely repulsive in the case of wca vs.  repulsive and attractive in the case of lj ) , the kinds of objects ( binary systems of particles vs.  systems of short polymers ) , or the ensembles used in the simulations ( nvt vs.  npt ) .",
    "all of this was despite the fact that , to simplify the analysis , we imposed some extra conditions on the form of the correlations , which may have made the agreement with the hypothesis appear less good than it would have been otherwise .    with regards to universality , the evidence we found was mixed .",
    "on the one hand , there were clear differences in the details of the results for different systems , for example for the anisotropy ratios .",
    "on the other hand , all the trends we observed were the same across systems , and the results for the correlation volumes did show some hints of universality , although the relatively large noise in this measurement did not allow for definite conclusions to be drawn . in any case",
    ", the commonality in the results is strong enough to suggest that other systems may display similar qualitative behaviors .",
    "thus , we expect that it would be very instructive to apply the same kind of test to data from other slowly relaxing systems , such as particle tracking data from glassy colloids  @xcite and from granular systems close to jamming  @xcite .",
    "finally , considering the success of the tests presented here , it becomes natural to ask if it is possible to extract from the data the actual fluctuating reparametrization @xmath163 , and to study its properties directly .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that some progress can be made in that direction .",
