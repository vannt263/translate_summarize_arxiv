    "we are concerned with the evolution of compact hypersurfaces @xmath0 moving according to the general non - local law of propagation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the normal velocity of @xmath3 which depends , through the evolution law @xmath4 , on time , on the position of @xmath5 , on the set @xmath6 enclosed by @xmath3 , on the unit normal @xmath7 to @xmath3 at @xmath8 pointing outward to @xmath6 and on its gradient @xmath9 which carries the curvature dependence of the velocity .    when such motion is local , i.e. , when @xmath4 does not depend on @xmath6 , and satisfies _ the inclusion principle _ or _",
    "geometrical monotonicity _ ,",
    "i.e. , when , at least formally , the inclusion @xmath10 at time @xmath11 implies @xmath12 for any @xmath13 , it is proved by souganidis and the first author @xcite that the motion can be defined and studied by the _ level set approach _ , which was introduced by osher and sethian @xcite for numerical calculations and then developed , from a theoretical point of view , by evans and spruck @xcite for the mean curvature motion and by chen , giga and goto @xcite for general velocities .",
    "this approach replaces the geometrical problem   with a degenerate parabolic partial differential equation called the _ geometric _ or _ level set equation .",
    "_ this equation is designed to describe the desired evolution via the 0-level set of its solution .",
    "more precisely , the existence and uniqueness of the level set solution @xmath14 allows to define @xmath3 as being the set @xmath15 .    in recent years , there has been much interest on the study of front propagations problems in cases when the normal velocity of the front depends on a non - local way of the enclosed region like .",
    "this interest was motivated by several types of applications like dislocations theory or fitzhugh - nagumo type systems or volume dependent velocities that we describe below .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the level set approach still applies for motions with nonlocal velocities provided that the inclusion principle holds , following the ideas of slepcev @xcite .",
    "but , in many of the above mentioned applications , one faces non - monotone surface evolution equations . for such class of problems",
    ", the level set approach can not be used directly since the classical comparison arguments of viscosity solutions theory fail and therefore , the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions to these equations become an issue .",
    "though the existence properties for such motions seem now to be well understood ( see @xcite ) , this is not the case for uniqueness . in particular , there are not many uniqueness results for curvature dependent velocities . as far as the authors know , there are only two works by forcadel @xcite and forcadel and monteillet @xcite which investigate the motion arising in a model for dislocation dynamics which is included by our general equations .",
    "the aim of this article is to consider cases where we have , at the same time , a non - local velocity which induces a non - monotone evolution together with a curvature dependence ( we explain later on the state of the art for such problems and why the curvature dependence creates a specific difficulty ) . more specifically , we describe a method to show short time uniqueness results for the general motion .",
    "we now describe some typical applications we have in mind .",
    "we first consider a model for dislocation dynamics @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the indicator function of a subset @xmath18 of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21}\\to{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] are given functions and we write @xmath22 here , @xmath23 denotes the @xmath24-dimensional unit sphere . the term @xmath25 is called the _ anisotropic _ ( or _ weighted _ ) _ mean curvature _ of @xmath3 at @xmath8 ( in the direction of @xmath7 ) .",
    "see for instance giga @xcite .",
    "typically , the reasonable assumptions in this context are the following : @xmath26 is a positive and bounded function , @xmath27 are bounded , continuous functions which are lipschitz continuous in @xmath8 variable ( uniformly with respect to @xmath28 variable ) , @xmath29;l^{1}({\\mathbb{r}}^n))$ ] and @xmath30 is a positively homogeneous function with degree @xmath31 .",
    "the surface evolution equation without the last term in the right hand side is well - known as typical models of the dislocation dynamics ( see @xcite for a derivation and the physical background ) .",
    "we next consider asymptotic equations of a fitzhugh - nagumo type system as an example of interface dynamics coupled with a diffusion equations , @xmath32 where @xmath33 are bounded and lipschitz continuous with @xmath34 .",
    "this system has been investigated by giga , goto and ishii @xcite and soravia and souganidis @xcite .    finally , we consider equations depending on the measure of the fronts like @xmath35 where the function @xmath36 is lipschitz continuous .",
    "a typical example is @xmath37 for some @xmath38 which has been investigated by chen , hilhorst and logak in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    as we already mentioned it above , these examples are not only nonlocal but also non - monotone surface evolution equations .",
    "indeed , in , the kernel @xmath39 may change sign and , in and in , the functions @xmath40 , @xmath41 may be non - monotone .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for some monotone non - local geometric equations . by using the framework which we present in this paper , we give short time uniqueness results for , and .",
    "there are many results of existence and uniqueness for the simplest case of motions of , i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 without a curvature term .",
    "a short time existence and uniqueness result was first obtained in @xcite .",
    "but then most of the results were obtained for curvature - independent velocities ( @xmath44 ) : long time existence and uniqueness results were obtained when the velocity is positive , i.e. , @xmath45 by alvarez , cardaliaguet and monneau in @xcite and by the first two authors in @xcite by different methods .",
    "the first two authors with cardaliaguet and monneau in @xcite presented a new notion of weak solutions ( see definition [ def weak sol ] ) of the level set equation for without a curvature term , gave the global existence of these weak solutions and analysed the uniqueness of them when   holds .",
    "a similar concept of solutions already appeared in @xcite . in the companion paper @xcite ,",
    "the first two authors with cardaliaguet and monteillet proposed a new perimeter estimate for the evolving fronts with uniform interior cone property and by using this , they extended the uniqueness result for dislocation dynamics equations and provided the uniqueness result for asymptotic equations of a fitzhugh - nagumo type system , still under the positiveness assumption  .    in this paper , we do not use the perimeter estimate in an essential way but either elementary measure estimates or , in the most sophisticated cases , the interior cone property ( see lemma [ lem - for - unique ] ) . since the studies by @xcite , it is now well - known that estimates on _ lower gradient bound _ and perimeter of @xmath31-level sets of viscosity solutions of associated local equations are key properties to obtain existence and uniqueness results for nonlocal equations derived from , and .",
    "let us describe the main difficulty of our problem and , to do so , we consider the level set equations of the simplest case of or here . considering the non - local part as a given function ,",
    "we are led to the study the ( local ) initial value problem @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48})$ ] are bounded and lipschitz continuous with respect to the @xmath8 variable .",
    "one of our main results is a short time lower gradient bound estimate for the viscosity solution of , i.e. , @xmath49 for first - order eikonal equations , lower gradient bound comes naturally from the barron - jensen s approach ( see @xcite ) . for second - order equations like",
    ", it is affected by the  _ diffusion _ \" term and the _ non - empty interior _ difficulty and therefore we can not expect that the property holds generally and for long - time",
    ". indeed , in  @xcite , see also  @xcite , they consider the simple example of   with @xmath50 and smooth @xmath51 such that @xmath52 on the initial front @xmath53 they prove that , up to choose suitable @xmath51 , fattening may occur for arbitrary @xmath54 i.e. , the front may develop an interior .",
    "it is precisely this reason which implies that there are not many results on the nonlocal second - order equations like the level sets equations of , and and a short - time result is optimal .",
    "existence results were obtained by @xcite but they concern merely existence of weak solutions defined by definition [ def weak sol ] . as stated above , there are two works @xcite which give uniqueness results for the motion . the difference between our results and",
    "theirs is that , in @xcite , only the evolution of hypersurfaces which can be expressed by graphs of functions is considered while , in @xcite , the arguments are based on minimizing movement for and they are completely different from our arguments which are based on the theory of viscosity solutions .",
    "moreover , for the existence of minimizing movement for the simplest case of , the assumptions that @xmath55 is symmetry and @xmath27 are smooth enough are essentially used .",
    "therefore , uniqueness results for the examples and are not covered by @xcite .    another difference with existing results in the literature is that @xmath4 is allowed to change sign in  , contrary to  @xcite where   is one of the main assumption to get uniqueness",
    ". it may give rise of fattening , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.4 ) , and it is another explanation of the short time result .    finally , we explain the key idea to obtain   for viscosity solutions of  . in order to get it , we make the following assumption on @xmath56 .",

    "but , on one hand , the general degenerate parabolic and nonlinear equations we consider do not have classical solutions in general , and on the other hand , the above assumption on @xmath51 is valid in cases when @xmath72 is not a smooth hypersurface , which is also an important point here .",
    "the proof of   uses in a crucial way the geometric property of and a _ continuous dependence result _ for parabolic problems ( which is , by the way , of independent interest ) .",
