    "many new cmb missions such as _ cobras / samba _ have adopted scan patterns with a relatively small number of scan circles in order to simplify the data analysis .",
    "the very successful _ cobe _ pattern of cycloidal scans that cross through each pixel in many different directions is not used , and this leads to an increased sensitivity to systematic errors .",
    "these new missions have adopted a total power or one - horned approach to maximize sensitivity relative to the differential approach used by _",
    "cobe_. but this often leads to excess low frequency or @xmath0 noise .",
    "a simple scan pattern with great circle scans perpendicular to the sun line can lead to _ striping _ even in the absence of @xmath0 noise .",
    "the simplest reference pattern is to reference each pixel in the scan to the nep .",
    "thus the equation to be solved in the map - making for pixel @xmath1 which is the @xmath2 pixel in the @xmath3 scan is t_j - t _",
    "= s(i , k ) - s(,k ) .",
    "we assume that the samples @xmath4 are uncorrelated ( white noise ) except for a constant baseline that has to be determined for each scan .",
    "but the baseline cancels out in this equation .",
    "the noise associated with this equation is @xmath5 times the noise per pixel because two values are subtracted .",
    "these observations can be inverted directly giving t _ & = & 0 + t_j & = & s(i , k ) - s(,k ) + t _ & = & _ k + where the first line is an assumption for @xmath6 .",
    "this appears to be the approach described in the text of janssen ( 1996 ) .",
    "the covariance matrix can also be computed directly : t _ t _ & = & + t_i t _ & = & + t_i t_i & = & 2 _ 1 ^ 2 + t_i t_j & = & + the non - zero covariance of pixels on the same scan circle shows the presence of striping .",
    "the factor of 2 in the variance of @xmath7 shows that this method has lost the putative @xmath5 advantage of one - horned systems .",
    "how can the @xmath5 be recovered ?",
    "a better baseline estimator is needed .",
    "for this white noise case , the average of all the noises in a scan circle is the optimum baseline estimator .",
    "but we do nt have the noises  we only measure samples which are the sum of noise plus sky .",
    "therefore we need to do any iterative solution to find the baseline :    subtract the signal from the scan using an estimate of the map ,    compute the optimum baseline estimate , and    use the signal minus baseline to construct a new estimate of the map .",
    "this procedure is almost identical to the time - ordered iterative approach used in wright , hinshaw & bennett ( 1996 ) .",
    "the only difference is that for differential data the contribution of the map to the `` baseline '' is just minus the sky temperature in the reference beam .",
    "if applied to a model with @xmath8 scans of @xmath9 pixels crossing only at the nep and sep , the optimum approach reduces the sensitivity loss to a factor of @xmath10 compared to an ideal total power system in the large @xmath9 limit . for large @xmath9",
    ", the difference between the nep and sep is determined to great precision , so the only significant terms in the covariance matrix are t_i t_i & = & _ 1 ^ 2 + t_i t_j & = & + this still has stripes , but both the noise and striping are reduced . in a real sky map ,",
    "the number of multiply observed pixels in the polar caps is quite large , so the both the excess noise and the striping are reduced even more .",
    "this approach of subtracting an optimal baseline after correcting the baseline iteratively for the effect of the map on the baseline is equivalent to the method of adjusting the baselines in each scan circle using the set of overlapping pixels that was used by",

    "to illustrate the operations in the map - making process , i will use a toy model of the sky .",

    "the actual construction of  and @xmath28 is impractical .",
    "however , the evaluation of  for any vector  can be done in a reasonable amount of time by following these steps :    apply : fly the mission through the map , which takes @xmath52 operations .",
    "apply @xmath53 : this is a convolution . for the scan circle case , the convolution is done in @xmath9 sample blocks , and the total work is @xmath54 operations when using the fft . for the continuously scanned case ,",
    "the filter to be applied to the data is @xmath55 points long and the total work is @xmath56 when using ffts .",
    "apply @xmath23 : sum into pixels , which takes @xmath52 operations .",
    "thus the evaluation of  takes @xmath56 operations and standard methods for the iterative solution of sparse systems that only need matrix - vector products can be used .",
    "this process should converge well for a complex scan pattern that crosses each pixel several times in different directions , such as the cycloidal scan produced by the scan plate in lubin s balloon experiment , shown in figure [ fig : ucsbscan.eps ] . a simple scan pattern such as rotating at constant elevation while the earth turns , shown in figure [ fig : firsscan.eps ] , will lead to much slower convergence of the iterations . since pixels are always scanned in the same direction ( unless the flight is long enough to see the sky both rising and setting )",
    ", the simple scan pattern will give a final map with stripes .",
    "these equations have been implemented for a bigger example using dmr pixels in galactic coordinates , and 256 scans through the ecliptic poles evenly spaced in ecliptic longitude , each scan having 256 points .",
    "thus there are a total of @xmath57 observations for @xmath58 pixels .",
    "since the whole matrices  or @xmath28 are too big to print out , i have made maps from a single row of these matrices .",
    "the pixel on the diagonal in this row is the lockman hole at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it was observed 10 times , which is close to the average exposure for the map .",
    "figure [ fig : spinner0.eps ] shows the white noise case .",
    "there is a small amount of excess noise and striping .",
    "the covariance matrices have been multiplied by the total number of data points , so a perfect experiment would have @xmath22 on the diagonal and @xmath61 in the off - diagonal pixels .",
    "figure [ fig : spinner1.eps ] shows the @xmath0 noise case .",
    "there is a larger amount of excess noise and striping , but it is concentrated in the low order multipoles .",
    "the angle scanned during one radian at @xmath36 for this case is @xmath62 , so excess noise in low multipoles is expected .",
    "half of the weight in the baseline filter in figure [ fig : w_0p1.eps ] is contained within @xmath63 of the central pixel , so @xmath64 is the effective chop angle .",
    "figure [ fig : cvslong.eps ] shows the covariance on a circle @xmath65 away from the central pixel , which peaks sharply when crossing the scan circle  an indication of striping .",
    "an even bigger example ( figure [ fig : cobe1.eps ] ) shows the result of a one - horned experiment using the _ cobe _ dmr scan path with @xmath0 noise .",
    "one million data points were processed , and the orbit precession ( yearly ) rate was increased by a factor of 60 so these @xmath66 points covered a full annual cycle .",
    "the length of the pre - whitening filter was @xmath67 .",
    "slow convolutions instead of fft s were used to evaluate a row of  and to iterate to find a row of @xmath28 .",
    "the time - ordered method took 30 seconds on a workstation to evaluate a product of the form @xmath68 .",
    "the residuals in @xmath69 were reduced by a factor @xmath70 after 20 iterations of the conjugate gradient method .",
    "these results are plotted at dmr resolution but the timing is independent of the number of pixels , @xmath22 , and directly proportional to the number of data points , @xmath18 .",
    "the angle scanned in one radian at @xmath36 was @xmath71 , so the only advantage this case has over figure [ fig : spinner1.eps ] is that scans were made through each pixel in every direction .",
    "thus it is not necessary to walk the baseline determination up to the nep and then down along some other longitude .",
    "thus the final covariance depends primarily on the distance between two points , giving a much more symmetric pattern in figure [ fig : cobe1.eps ] .",
    "the lockman hole was observed 189 times , and the diagonal element of the covariance matrix is 0.00633 , so there is 20% excess noise at the pixel level .",
    "the highest off - diagonal element in the lockman hole row is 8 times smaller than the diagonal element .    in general",
    "a symmetric covariance is much easier to analyze , since it leads to a noise level that depends only on @xmath72 .",
    "but in the absence of systematic errors , figures [ fig : spinner0.eps ] and even [ fig : spinner1.eps ] can give useful cmb data  especially if the overall noise level is low enough ( janssen 1996 ) .",
    "a systematic error term is a non - random signal in the time - ordered data that is not caused by the sky . since true patterns on the sky form an @xmath22-dimension subspace in the @xmath18-dimensional data space ,",
    "a systematic error term can be    orthogonal to the sky subspace - these can be ignored .",
    "parallel to the sky subspace - these can not be fixed .    at an intermediate angle to the sky subpsace",
    "- these must be measured and corrected .",
    "figure [ fig : sys_err.eps ] shows these possibilities .",
    "an example of a systematic error that is almost orthogonal to the sky subspace is the @xmath73 magnetic term in the _ cobe _ dmr .",
    "this is a susceptibility to a magnetic field along the axis perpendicular to the plane containing the plus and minus horns on a dmr .",
    "the bottom plot in figure [ fig : bysyserr.eps ] shows the time - ordered data produced by this term , which can then be made into a map .",
    "that map is then converted back into time - ordered data , giving the top plot .",
    "since the top and bottom plots are very different , it is easy to measure the @xmath73 sensitivity and correct for it .",
    "a @xmath74 term is due to a sensitivity to magnetic fields in the plane defined by the horns but perpendicular to the spin axis .",
    "this produces a map with a large dipole aligned with the celestial pole .",
    "but the @xmath74 term is not completely parallel to the sky subspace because the earth s magnetic dipole is offset and tilted so there is a diurnal modulation of the input shown on the bottom of figure [ fig : bzsyserr.eps ] that is not seen in the playback ( top ) .",
    "thus it is possible to measure a @xmath74 term and remove its effect from the map .",
    "an example of a systematic error that is parallel to the sky subspace for a simple scan pattern perpendicular to the sun - line through the ecliptic poles is zodiacal light emission . with the more complex scan pattern used by the dmr this effect can be measured and removed from the map .",
    "obviously one should try to make all systematic errors orthogonal to the sky subspace .",
    "this is made easier if the data space is much larger than the sky subspace .",
    "therefore the number of data points transmitted to the ground should be as large as possible , and on - board co - addition into scan circles should be avoided .    to avoid stripes",
    ", scans should be made through every pixel in all possible directions .",
    "this requires a large number of scans and a large number of data points , which are also desired to reduce systematic error problems .",
    "i have shown how to analyze large datasets from one - horned cmb experiments without simplified scan patterns that are vulnerable to systematic errors .",
