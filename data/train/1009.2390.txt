    "in this section , we propose how the superposed operation @xmath0 can be implemented in experiment .",
    "a key idea here is to erase which - path information on whether the implemented operation refers to the photon subtraction @xmath1 or the photon addition @xmath2 , as described below .",
    "first , note that the success of both the operations , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , can be heralded by a detection of a single photon in an optical scheme .",
    "when an arbitrary initial state @xmath101 is injected into a beam - splitter with the other input in a vacuum state , the detection of a single - photon at one output port heralds that a photon is subtracted from the initial state , due to the conservation of photon number .",

    "if the state @xmath101 is injected to a signal mode of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier ( ndpa ) with the idler mode in a vacuum state , the detection of a single photon at the output idler mode heralds that one photon is added to the input state , due to the pairwise photon - creation and -annihilation process in the ndpa .",
    "this corresponds to the action @xmath103 , which holds well particularly when the interaction strength in the ndpa is small @xcite . with these two schemes combined , if the which - path information on the detected single - photon is erased by using an additional beam splitter ( @xmath104 ) with transmissivity @xmath105 [ fig .",
    "7 ] , the coherent superposition @xmath0 can be conditionally implemented .    in fig .",
    "7 , an arbitrary state @xmath101 is injected into the parametric down - converter with small coupling strength @xmath106 , which acts as @xmath107 next , the bs1 ( transmissivity : @xmath108 ) acts on the state @xcite as latexmath:[\\ ] ] with the detection of single - photon at pd1 ( pd2 ) and no photon at pd2 ( pd1 ) , we see from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : con_st ] ) that the state collapses to @xmath113 , where @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "experimental imperfections , e.g. nonideal photo - detection , will be further considered in the next section to investigate the implemented operation particularly on generating an arbitrary superposition state .    as a remark ,",
    "we note the identity @xmath118 and @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the squeezing operator ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "thus , one may alternatively implement the coherent operation @xmath0 by a sequence of squeezing operation , photon subtraction ( addition ) , and the inverse squeezing , @xmath122 ( @xmath123 , for the case of @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "however , this scheme seems to be more demanding than the above proposal based on a single - photon interferometer , as the number of required nonlinear resources is increased .",
    "moreover , a very large squeezing @xmath126 is needed to implement @xmath0 when the subtraction and the addition parts are comparable to each other , i.e. @xmath127 . even assuming that the squeezing operations can be performed perfectly , we have calculated the output fidelity for superposition states @xmath7 similar to fig .",
    "8 and found that this alternative scheme does not make improvement .",

    "first , note the identity @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , which sequentially represents a displacement , the coherent operation , and the inverse displacement . if a single photon state @xmath9 is used as an input , @xmath131 yields a superposition of number states as @xmath132 . in principle , a succession of @xmath131 , i.e. , @xmath133 will yield any desired superposition state by properly choosing the parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 .    in this paper , we focus on the generation of superposition states @xmath7 with practical imperfections such as the non - unit photodetection efficiency and the nonideal single - photon source considered . in particular",

    "a practically generated single - photon source is identified as a mixture of one - photon and vacuum state , @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the source efficiency @xcite . when inserted into the experimental scheme of fig .",

    "the coefficient @xmath168 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : prac_st ] ) ] .",
    "this is due to the use of on - off detector that does not distinguish photon - numbers and @xmath167 arises in the output state @xmath169 due to the detection of higher - number of photons than a single - photon . in general , nevertheless , the fidelity @xmath164 is largely insensitive to the detector efficiency @xmath138 , and depends substantially on the single - photon source efficiency @xmath140 only . with @xmath152",

    "it has been shown that the operation creates nonclassicality out of a classical state with observable effects such as squeezing and sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "for the coherent - state inputs , the degree of nonclassicality measured by negative volume in phase space increases with the ratio @xmath22 , while that measured by nonclassical depth due to c. t. lee is maximal regardless of @xmath22 . in particular , given an input coherent amplitude @xmath24 , the squeezing effect occurs optimally for @xmath171 , which implies that the coherent operation generally achieves better squeezing than the bare photon addition @xmath2 . for the thermal - state inputs , the degree of nonclassicality increases with @xmath22 measured by both the negative volume and the nonclassical depth .",
