    "doped eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 superconductors stand out among fe - based superconductors ( fescs ) , because the eu@xmath3 local spins ( @xmath4=7/2 ) may order _ ferromagnetically _ in the superconducting state@xcite .",
    "the undoped eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 undergoes an @xmath5-type antiferromagnetic ( namely , in - plane ferromagnetic while inter - plane antiferromagnetic ) transition at 19 k in the eu sublattice@xcite , in addition to a spin - density wave ( sdw ) transition at 190 k in the fe sublattice . in the magnetically ordered state",
    ", the eu spins align along the crystallographic [ 110 ] direction , collinear with the fe moments@xcite . upon partial p - for - as substitution , which effectively induces a chemical pressure ,",
    "the fe - site sdw order is suppressed , and then superconductivity ( sc ) emerges at @xmath6 26 k@xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the eu spins become ferromagnetically ordered at @xmath7 20 k , accompanying with a spin reorientation towards the [ 001 ] ( or @xmath8-axis ) direction@xcite .",
    "similar coexistence of fe - based sc and eu - spin ferromagnetism ( fm ) was also observed and verified in several fe - site electron - doped eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 systems@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there have been some debates on the details of the eu - spin ordering . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that sc coexists with eu - spin antiferromagnetism ( afm ) in the superconducting regime of eufe@xmath1(as@xmath9p@xmath10)@xmath1 .",
    "later , zapf et al.@xcite proposed that sc coexists with a canted afm , such that it is virtually ferromagnetic along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "these authors@xcite further revised the electronic phase diagram because of the discovery of a reentrant spin glass state .",
    "recent x - ray resonant magnetic scattering@xcite and neutron scattering@xcite experiments however indicated long - range ferromagnetic orderings for eu spins in superconducting eufe@xmath1(as@xmath9p@xmath10)@xmath1 with @xmath11 = 0.19 and 0.15 , respectively .",
    "it was demonstrated that the eu spins align exactly along the @xmath8 axis , in contradiction to the spin - canting scenario .",
    "so far , this discrepancy remains unresolved .",
    "note that the spin - tilting angle ( @xmath220@xmath12 from the @xmath8 axis , as detected by mssbauer measurements@xcite ) coincides with the direction that connects the interlayer next - nearest ( nn ) eu atoms because of the body - centered eu sublattice . to clarify whether the eu - sublattice type is relevant to eu spin orientations ,",
    "it is desirable to study a related material system in which eu atoms form a primitive tetragonal lattice .",
    "local - moment fm and spin - singlet sc are known to be mutually incompatible@xcite , which makes their coexistence ( hereafter abbreviated as fm+sc ) very rare@xcite .",
    "the fm+sc phenomenon observed in fescs has been ascribed to the multi - orbital character as well as the robustness of superconductivity against magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the zero - temperature upper critical magnetic field , @xmath13 , of fescs is typically higher than 50 t@xcite , which is large enough to fight the internal exchange field that is comparable to the hyperfine field on the eu nucleus ( @xmath2 25 t)@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the eu - spin fm can be satisfied even in the presence of sc , because the fe-3@xmath14 multi - orbitals enable both superconducting pairing ( dominated by the @xmath15 and @xmath16 electrons@xcite ) and the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) exchange interaction between eu local moments .",
    "the rkky interaction can be mediated by different fe-3@xmath14 orbitals such as @xmath17 and @xmath18@xcite .",
    "therefore , both sc and local - moment fm can be favored in fescs@xcite .",
    "the crucial factor that leads to eu local - moment fm should be the interlayer rkky interaction , since the in - plane rkky coupling remains ferromagnetic even in the parent compound eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 .",
    "the interlayer exchange coupling ( @xmath19 ) is simplified to be proportional to @xmath20 for a large @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fermi wave vector and @xmath21 denotes the distance between local moments .",
    "this means that @xmath19 can be changed from negative ( afm ) to positive ( fm ) by tuning the @xmath23 value .",
    "the afm - to - fm transition in eufe@xmath1(as@xmath9p@xmath10)@xmath1@xcite and eu(fe@xmath9ni@xmath10)@xmath1as@xmath1@xcite is mainly due to the change in @xmath22 ( where the heavy three - dimensional hole pocket@xcite seems to be involved ) , simply because the interlayer eu interatomic distance ( @xmath24 ) varies only slightly .",
    "indeed , based on a first - principles calculation@xcite , the effective interlayer nn magnetic coupling changes from antiferromagnetic in eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 to ferromagnetic in eufe@xmath1p@xmath1 , while the in - plane coupling remains ferromagnetic .",
    "the above statement suggests an alternative approach to realize the afm - to - fm transition which may lead to an fm+sc state as well . by constructing a crystal structure in which @xmath24 changes significantly",
    ", the sign of @xmath19 may be altered accordingly .",
    "we previously designed a related structure , exemplified as klafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( 1144)@xcite , which can be viewed as an intergrowth of kfe@xmath1as@xmath1 and lafe@xmath1as@xmath1 . in the eu analog , @xmath25eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath25 denotes an alkali metal ) , the eu atoms form a _ primitive _ tetragonal lattice , such that the lines that connect the interlayer - nn eu atoms are exactly parallel to the @xmath8 axis .",
    "notably , the @xmath24 value is roughly doubled because every alternate eu atoms are replaced by @xmath25 along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "very recently , we became aware of the report of @xmath26fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath27=ca , sr , ba ) superconductors which possess the identical 1144-type structure@xcite .",
    "this work inspires us to re - investigate our target material @xmath25eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "consequently , we succeeded in synthesizing a 1144 compound rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 . in this paper , we report the crystal structure and physical properties of this new material .",
    "we indeed observe an eu - spin fm at 15 k which coexists with a bulk sc at an unexpectedly high @xmath28 of 36.5 k. remarkably , the evidence for fm+sc are very robust , compared to the previous fm+sc phenomena in doped eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 systems@xcite . apart from fm+sc , additional intriguing phenomena were also observed and discussed .",
    "rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 polycrystalline samples were prepared via a solid - state reaction method .",
    "first , feas , euas and rbas were prepared using source materials rb ( 99.75% ) , as ( 99.999% ) and eu ( 99.9% ) pieces and fe powder ( 99.998% ) .",
    "the presynthesized arsenides were then ball milled separately for 10 minutes in a glove box filled with pure ar ( the water and oxygen content is below 1 ppm ) .",
    "second , stoichiometric mixtures ( namely , rb : eu : fe : as=1:1:4:4 ) of fe , feas , euas and rbas were homogenized , pressed into pellets , and then loaded in an alumina tube - like crucible which was sealed in a ta tube .",
    "the ta tube was protected in a quartz ampoule filled with ar gas ( @xmath2 0.6 bar ) .",
    "third , the sample - loaded ampoule was heated rapidly to 1123 - 1173 k in a muffle furnace . after holding for 6 hours ,",
    "the sample was quenched , similar to the approach in synthesizing @xmath26fe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the sample s quality could be improved by repeating the solid - state reaction .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was carried out on a panalytical x - ray diffractometer with a monochromatic cu - k@xmath29 radiation .",
    "the crystal structure was refined by a rietveld analysis using a rietan software@xcite .",
    "the electrical transport and heat capacity measurements were conducted on a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms-9 ) . in the resistivity measurement , a four - electrode method and the ac transport option were employed .",
    "the sample pellet was cut into a thin rectangular bar with a dimension of 2.2@xmath301.1@xmath300.5 mm@xmath31 , on which thin gold wires were attached with silver paint .",
    "the excitation current was set to 5.18 ma .",
    "the hall coefficient was measured by permutating the voltage and current electrodes@xcite , using a thin - square sample ( 1.3@xmath301.3@xmath300.12 mm@xmath31 ) with four symmetric electrodes attached .",
    "the excitation current was 20 ma , and the applied magnetic field was 80 koe .",
    "the heat capacity was measured by a thermal relaxation method using a square - shaped sample plate with a mass of 19.5 mg .",
    "the dc magnetization for a regular shape sample ( in order to estimate the demagnetization factor ) was measured on a quantum design mpms-5 equipment .",
    "different kind of protocols of zero - field cooling ( zfc ) and field - cooling ( fc ) were employed for probing the superconducting and magnetic transitions .",
    "the as - prepared sample was characterized by powder xrd .",
    "the result shows that most of the reflections can be indexed using a tetragonal lattice , whose unit - cell size ( @xmath32 3.89  and @xmath33 13.31  ) is close to other 1144-type compounds@xcite .",
    "the intensity of the strongest reflection of the impurity phase , which is identified to be unreacted feas , is only 2.5% of that of the ( 103 ) diffraction peak of the main phase , indicating high quality of the sample .",
    "the appearance of ( @xmath34 ) reflections with @xmath35=odd numbers confirms that the tetragonal lattice is primitive rather than body centered .",

    "it can be also viewed as a modified eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 in which every alternate eu atoms are replaced by rb atoms along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "it is the structural modification that changes the lattice from body - centered to primitive .",
    "additionally , the local coordination environment for fe atoms turns out to be asymmetric . according to the refined structural parameters listed in table  [ structure ] , the fe@xmath37as bondlengths are no longer equal .",
    "consequently , as1 ( at rb side ) and as2 ( at eu side ) heights from the fe plane are remarkably different ( 1.249  and 1.467  , respectively ) . meanwhile , the bond angles as1@xmath37fe@xmath37as1 and as2@xmath37fe@xmath37as2 are 112.50@xmath12 and 109.04@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "note that the as relative heights as well as the bond angles are opposite to the result in rbcafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the fe - coordination asymmetry does not interfere with the occurrence of sc , although it could influence the superconducting pairing symmetry .",

    ", no third - order magnetic transition has been reported in a real material before .",
    "as we know , most magnetic ordering transitions are described by landau s second - order phase transition theory .",
    "therefore , the observation of third - order magnetic transition deserves further investigations .",
    "rbfe@xmath1as@xmath1 is known to be a 2.6 k superconductor@xcite , while eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 belongs to a parent compound of fescs@xcite . here",
    "we show that , interestingly , their hybrid material rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 turns out to be a ferromagnetic superconductor .",
    "similar material hybridization effect in fescs is witnessed in ba@xmath1ti@xmath1fe@xmath1as@xmath0o@xcite which is actually an intergrowth of non - superconducting bati@xmath1as@xmath1o and bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 .",
    "ba@xmath1ti@xmath1fe@xmath1as@xmath0o shows sc at 21 k owing to a charge transfer between different layers , in relation with an electron - correlation effect@xcite . here in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,",
    "the isolated ",
    "rbfe@xmath1as@xmath1 \" block is heavily hole doped , in contrast with the undoped state in the  eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 \" block .",
    "consequently , the structural hybridization leads to a charge homogenization , since there is only one equivalent fe site .",
    "namely , rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 is naturally hole doped by 22.5% .",
    "we hope that such a structural hybridization approach by design@xcite may be utilized for future material explorations .",
    "notably , the @xmath71 value of rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 is unexpectedly high , which is nearly equal to the maximum @xmath71 of 36.8 k for cssrfe@xmath0as@xmath0 in the @xmath26fe@xmath0as@xmath0 series@xcite .",
    "previous studies on doped eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 superconductors show that the @xmath71 is always significantly lower than the eu - free counterparts , which is ascribed to the eu4@xmath105fe@xmath106 interaction .",
    "therefore , the unsuppressed @xmath71 in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 suggests vanishingly small eu4@xmath105fe@xmath107 coupling .",
    "the elongation of eu@xmath37fe interatomic distance from 3.604  in eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 to 3.685  in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 supports this point of view . in addition",
    ", the high value of @xmath52d@xmath53/d@xmath54 ( @xmath375.6 t / k ) as well as the large specific - heat jump ( 7.5 j k@xmath78 mol@xmath78 ) further indicates robustness of sc in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the robust sc , evidence of eu fm is also strong and sufficient .",
    "the @xmath69 data show an obvious magnetic hysteresis ( with a coersive field of 360 oe at 2 k ) as well as a saturation magnetization ( 6.5 @xmath73/eu ) that corresponds to eu@xmath3-spin ferromagnetic alignment .",
    "besides , both the positive paramagnetic curie temperature and the increase of @xmath96 with magnetic field support the ferromagnetic transition scanario . hopefully , future measurements of the anisotropic magnetic properties using single crystal samples will give more information on the magnetic state .",
    "needless to say , investigations of the mssbauer spectra , x - ray resonant magnetic scattering and neutron scattering will be definitely helpful to clarity the eu - spin orientation and other related information .",
    "the appearance of eu fm in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 can be explained in terms of modification of @xmath19 , since @xmath19 [ @xmath108 _ oscillates _ and tends to decay with @xmath24 . in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,",
    "the interlayer eu interatomic distance @xmath24 becomes 13.31  , which is almost twice as the @xmath24 value in eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 ( 6.657  ) .",
    "this may change the sign of @xmath19 , resulting in an eu fm . the lowered curie temperature [ about 4 k lower than that of eufe@xmath1(as@xmath48p@xmath49)@xmath1 ] seems to be associated with the decay of @xmath19 .",
    "the weak interlayer magnetic coupling not only accounts for the relatively low curie temperature , but also justifies the robustness of sc .",
    "additionally , it could be related to the third - order transition observed , because of the enhanced two dimensionality which allows strong magnetic fluctuations above @xmath96 .",
    "finally , let us discuss how sc and fm compromise in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "there were a few theoretical proposals available on the fm+sc issue decades ago@xcite .",
    "the first solution is that fm is modified in the form of a ",
    "cryptoferromagnetic \" state or a multidomain structure ( with domain size @xmath14 ) , hence the superconducting cooper pairs feel no net magnetization if the superconducting coherent length satisfies @xmath110@xcite .",
    "the second idea considers that superconducting cooper pairs are  magnetized \" by the exchange fields , such that they possess non - zero momentum@xcite , or equivalently , sc is modulated to be inhomogeneous in real space@xcite .",
    "this scenario is often called fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state .",
    "alternatively , the internal spontaneous magnetization field from fm penetrates the superconductor , which induces  spontaneous vortices \" even at zero external field , hence called spontaneous vortex ( sv ) state@xcite .",
    "since non - superconducting defects tend to trap spontaneous vortices , the fflo state is believed to be preferably stabilized in a clean - limit superconductor . as for the rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 system , the first candidate seems to be unlikely , because the estimated coherence length at zero temperature is only 1.52 nm@xcite , which constrains the ferromagnetic domain size too much to present a long - range order .",
    "note that the residual resistivity tends to be very small by a rough extrapolation ( see fig .",
    "2 ) even for the polycrystalline sample , which means a quite long electron mean free path and , the flux - pinning effect is not severe from the fc diamagnetic signal ( see fig .",
    "these facts suggest that the superconductor is probably in a clean limit at lower temperatures .",
    "we thus speculate that the anomaly at @xmath66 5 k could be related to the change in the way of fm+sc .",
    "there are indeed some signatures .",
    "the bifurcation of fcc and fch curves above @xmath61 , shown in fig .",
    "3 , implies the transformation from fflo to sv state .",
    "the small specific - heat jump at @xmath61 [ fig .",
    "6(c ) ] suggests a weak phase transition .",
    "in addition , @xmath61 increases with field .",
    "obviously , more investigations are needed to address this interesting issue .",
    "to summarize , we have discovered an iron - based compound rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 in which an unprecedented coexistence of sc and fm is observed .",
    "the new material crystallizes in an intergrowth structure of body - centered rbfe@xmath1as@xmath1 and eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 , which drastically changes the physical properties .",
    "the feas layers are found to be hole doped by the material itself , presenting a large normal - state electronic specific - heat coefficient ( @xmath2 150 mj k@xmath89 mol@xmath78 ) and a pauli spin susceptibility ( @xmath2 0.00178 emu mol@xmath78 ) .",
    "bulk superconductivity at @xmath28 = 36.5 k and eu - spin ferromagnetism at 15 k are unambiguously demonstrated .",
    "the specific - heat jump at @xmath28 is as high as 7.5 j k@xmath78 mol@xmath78 .",
    "the eu - spin ferromagnetism is manifested by a magnetic hysteresis with a 360-oe coersive field at 2 k , a saturation magnetization of 6.5 @xmath73/eu , and a saturation field of @xmath2 1.5 koe at low temperatures .",
    "there are two additional novel phenomena observed in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "first , the eu - spin ferromagnetic transition is of a rare third order , evidenced by the continuity in @xmath86 and discontinuity in d@xmath79/d@xmath72 at @xmath96 .",
    "second , a weak anomaly at about 5 k possibly reflects the interplay between sc and fm . these intriguing observations together with the robust coexistence of sc and fm call for further investigations on the interesting title material .",
