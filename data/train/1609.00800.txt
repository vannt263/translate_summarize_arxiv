    "over more than two decades , the laser atom cooling @xcite and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of dilute atomic gases @xcite are under intense investigation for interesting physics as well as for various applications . with the advent of techniques of laser cooling and trapping of atoms , such as magneto - optical trap ( mot ) ,",
    "an unprecedented control on number and temperature in an atomic sample has been possible , which has proved useful in various atomic physics experiments @xcite and technological applications such as atom - lithography @xcite , accurate atomic clocks @xcite , cold - atom gyroscopes @xcite , cold - atom accelerometers and gravimeters @xcite , atomic magnetometers @xcite , etc .",
    "cold atoms trapped in a periodic potential formed by the standing wave pattern of far detuned laser beams , known as optical lattice , mimic the electrons in a periodic potential of a crystal lattice . because of opportunity to tailor the potential of optical lattices in several ways , cold atoms and bose condensate of atoms trapped in optical lattices serve as a test bed to model and verify various condensed matter phenomena with a greater flexibility than before @xcite and also provide opportunity to explore dynamics of matter - waves @xcite .",
    "further , cold atoms in optical lattices are also considered promising systems for future technology of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the cooling and trapping of atoms has also enriched our basic understanding of atomic physics which includes behaviour of fermions and bosons confined in different dimensions and geometries , feshbach resonances @xcite , dressed states of atom in strong optical @xcite and radio - frequency @xcite fields .",
    "thus preparation of cold atoms and bose condensate samples of atomic gases is the first step to proceed towards different uses as discussed above .",
    "a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) is a robust and reliable technique to produce cold atomic samples in the temperature range of 10 - 100 @xmath1 with number density in the range of @xmath2 @xmath3 . to obtain a bose condensate of the atoms , for example in @xmath4rb atom cloud , a further lower temperature ( in the sub - micro - kelvin range ) and higher number density ( in the range @xmath5 @xmath3 )",
    "is needed .",
    "this comes from the requirement of the phase - space density ( @xmath6 ) of the atom cloud to be greater than 2.61 for bec , where @xmath7 is number density of atoms and @xmath8 is de - broglie wavelength . due to dissipative processes in resonant interaction of atoms with light , it is difficult to achieve such a high value of phase space - density in the atom cloud in a mot . thus to achieve bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a dilute atomic gas , the laser cooling in a mot",
    "is used as the first stage of cooling which is succeeded by the second stage cooling known as evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "there are several variants of design of an experimental setup to implement the above two - stage cooling protocol for achieving bec .",
    "the second stage cooling , i.e. evaporative cooling , is performed while atoms are trapped in a conservative potential of either a magnetic trap or a dipole trap of a far detuned laser beam @xcite . for evaporative cooling ,",
    "an ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) environment is necessary to have a long lifetime of atoms in the trap during the evaporative cooling .",
    "this uhv requirement conflicts with the requirement of background vapor needed for the mot loading . one way to resolve this issue is to use the concept of double - mot setup @xcite , which implements the formation the first mot in a vapor chamber and the second mot in an uhv chamber by transferring the cold atoms from the first mot ( i.e. vapor chamber mot ) .",
    "the vapor chamber and uhv chamber are connected , but differentially pumped to maintain the different levels of pressure . in the double - mot setup",
    ", the mot in the vapor chamber is called `` vc - mot '' , whereas the mot in the uhv chamber is called `` uhv - mot '' .",
    "we have developed an experimental setup based on this double - mot scheme to achieve the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of @xmath4rb atoms .    in this article ,",
    "we report the in - situ characterization of rf - field induced evaporatively cooled atom cloud of @xmath4rb atoms in a quadrupole ioffe configuration ( quic ) magnetic trap .",
    "the in - situ absorption images of the cooled atom cloud have shown clear bimodal optical density ( od ) profiles which indicate the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) phase transition in the trapped gas .",
    "we also report , for the first time to the best of our knowledge , the measured variation in the sizes of the condensate and thermal clouds with the final frequency in the frequency scan of the rf - field applied for evaporative cooling .",
    "the results are consistent with the theory",
    ". these in - situ results can be useful to characterize the bose condensate when it is difficult to switch - off the trap for the time - of - flight observations .",

    "is used for formation of vapor chamber mot ( vc - mot ) .",
    "a quartz glass cell kept at a pressure of @xmath11 torr , referred as uhv - mot chamber , is used for loading uhv - mot . a narrow tube of length 122 mm , called differential pumping tube ( dpt ) , is connected between the cell and the octagonal chamber to ensure the differential pressure between them .",
    "the upper part ( towards the vc - mot chamber ) of this tube has diameter of 2.5 mm upto 60 mm length and the remaining part has the diameter of 5 mm .",
    "this design is adapted to achieve the desired conductance as well as to accommodate the transverse expansion of the atom - flux during the transfer of atoms from vc - mot to uhv - mot .",
    "a six - way cross made from a cube of ss is used for connecting the octagonal vc - mot chamber and the glass cell through the differential pumping tube , as shown in fig.[fig : fig1expt_setup ] .",
    "the sides of this cube have appropriate knife - edges to connect other components with nw35cf flanges . a combination sputter ion pump ( vacion plus , 150 l / s starcell with a non - evaporable getter ( neg ) module , from varian , italy ) and a separate neg pump ( gp-100mk5 , sorb - ac mk5 type cartridge pump from saes getters , italy )",
    "are also connected to the cube for pumping out the glass cell to the necessary uhv level . a turbo molecular pump ( tmp ) of capacity 70",
    "l / s and a sputter ion pump of capacity 20 l / s are connected to the octagonal vc - mot chamber .",
    "bayerd - alpert ( ba ) type ion gauges are used for measuring the pressure in the vc - mot chamber and glass cell during the pumping . for measuring the very low pressure in the glass cell ( uhv - mot chamber ) ,",
    "an extractor gauge ( oerlikon leybold ) , which can sense the pressure value upto @xmath12 torr , is connected to the chamber to which glass cell is connected . during the evacuation process ,",
    "first of all the tmp is used for roughing and degassing of the whole vacuum system .",
    "a prolonged baking of the vacuum system for the duration of a week ( @xmath137x24 hours ) at temperature of 100 - 150 @xmath14c is performed for a good degassing of the whole system . during this baking , all the ion pumps and gauges",
    "are also baked and degassed .",
    "after cooling down of the vacuum system , all the ion pumps and neg modules are activated and then tmp is switched - off and isolated from the vacuum system by using a gate - valve . with the ion pumps and neg pumps on , the pressure of  @xmath15 torr in the octagonal chamber and  @xmath16 torr in the glass cell are reached over a period of one to two days .",
    "\\(b ) laser systems and optical layout :    the relevant energy levels of @xmath4rb atom are as shown in fig.[fig : fig2_rb_transition_level ] .",
    "the cooling transition for @xmath4rb is f = 2 to f@xmath17=3 and repumping transition is f=1 to f@xmath17=2 .",
    "the frequencies of various laser beams used in the experiments are set as shown schematically in fig.[fig : fig2_rb_transition_level ] .",
    "the lasers are frequency stabilized and locked using saturated absorption spectroscopy ( sas ) technique .",
    "different laser beams used for cooling , repumping , pushing , optical pumping and absorption imaging are derived from several external cavity diode lasers ( ecdls ) operating at @xmath18780.2 nm . their frequencies are referenced and locked according to the use .",
    "the cooling laser beams for vc - mot and uhv - mot are derived from the output beam of an oscillator - amplifier system .",
    "this system can deliver upto @xmath131500 mw power in the output laser beam when a tapered amplifier ( boosta , toptica , germany ) is seeded by an external cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) oscillator ( dl-100 , toptica , germany ) . the re - pumping laser beams for both the mots are obtained from two independent ecdl systems .",
    "the push beam is derived from another ecdl system . the absorption probe and optical pumping beams are derived from the cooling laser beams .",
    "the fig.[fig : fig3_optical_layout ] shows the schematic of the optical layout of the components used for manipulation of the laser beams for various purposes .",
    "various optical components such as polarizing beam splitters ( pbss ) , waveplates ( @xmath19/4 and @xmath19/2 ) , mirrors , lenses , acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) , beam expanders ( bes ) , etc are used for different functions which include splitting , combining , setting the polarizations , reflecting , focusing , switching and controlling power , frequency shifting , expansion , etc . of the laser beams .",
    "the output from the boosta amplifier ( ta ) is split to obtain the cooling beam for vc - mot ( power @xmath13 250 mw ) , cooling beam for uhv - mot ( power @xmath13 180 mw ) and optical pumping beam ( power @xmath13 3 mw ) . the cooling beam for vc - mot , after a double pass through an aom , is further split and expanded to derive three vc - mot beams ( power @xmath13 20 mw in each beam ) .",
    "the vc - mot re - pumping laser beam from the laser dl-3 ( power @xmath13 15 mw ) is mixed to one of three vc - mot beams as shown in fig.[fig : fig3_optical_layout ] .",
    "these three vc - mot beams are injected into the octagonal vc - mot chamber in retro - reflection configuration to obtain the required six beam for vc - mot formation .",
    "the quarter wave plates are used to set the appropriate polarization of the vc - mot beams for mot formation .",
    "the cooling beam for uhv - mot , after a double pass through an aom and expansion , is first mixed with a re - pumping laser beam and then split to obtain two uhv - mot beams as fig.[fig : fig3_optical_layout ] .",
    "the repumping beam for uhv - mot is derived from a 100 mw ecdl ( dl-2 ) after double pass through an aom as shown in fig.[fig : fig3_optical_layout ] .",
    "these two uhv - mot beams are further split to obtain six independent uhv - mot beams .",
    "all the six uhv - mot beams have nearly equal power of @xmath13 10 mw in the cooling part in each beam .",
    "the total power ( @xmath13 20 mw ) in repumping part , however , is not equally distributed in all the six uhv - mot beams .",
    "this is because of different polarizations of cooling and re - pumping lasers after mixing and before splitting . unlike the cooling power ,",
    "the different repumping power in the six uhv - mot beams does not cause any problem in the operation of uhv - mot .",
    "however , six independent uhv - mot beams with equal cooling power are suitable for stable uhv - mot operation and for lowering the temperature of atom cloud during the molasses stage .",
    "\\(c ) coils for formation of mots and magnetic trapping :    for the vc - mot , a pair identical coils having currents in anti - helmholtz configuration is used .",
    "each coil has 150 number of turns of copper wire of diameter @xmath20 1.5 mm , with size of coil as : inner diameter ( i d ) @xmath20 57 mm , outer diameter ( d ) @xmath20 66 mm and length @xmath2038 mm .",
    "the coils provide a quadrupole field gradient of @xmath20 10 g / cm in the axial direction at dc current of 3 a in the coils for @xmath20 55 mm face to face separation between the coils . for the uhv - mot ,",
    "another pair of coils , each coil having 230 number of turns ( i d @xmath20 34 mm , od @xmath20 70 mm , length @xmath20 35 mm and wire diameter @xmath20 1.4 mm ) , is used with face to face separation between coils @xmath20 47 mm . with current in anti - helmholtz configuration , these coils generate a quadrupole field with axial field gradient of @xmath13 10 g / cm for a current of 1 a in each coil .",
    "these coils are kept inside suitably designed teflon housing in which cold water is circulated for cooling of the coils .",
    "these uhv - mot coils are also used as quadrupole trap coils for magnetic trapping of the atoms after initial cooling and trapping in the uhv - mot . in the quadrupole magnetic trap ,",
    "a high current ( @xmath2120 a ) flows in the coils , which makes the cooling of the coils necessary .",
    "the quadrupole magnetic trap is converted to a quadrupole - ioffe configuration ( quic ) trap by including a third coil ( called ioffe coil ) in the quadrupole trap setup .",
    "the ioffe coil is placed at an axis passing through the quadrupole trap centre and perpendicular to the quadrupole trap axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quic_trap_coil ] . the purpose of the quic trap is to have a magnetic trap with non - zero magnetic field at the minimum of the trap potential , which helps in reducing trap losses due to majorana spin flips encounter in a quadrupole trap @xcite .",
    "\\(d ) controller system :    an industrial personal computer ( pc ) installed with a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) card has been used to program and control the experimental procedure in the desired sequence .",
    "the durations and sequence of various events from vc - mot formation to evaporative cooling and imaging are set using this controller system .",
    "the fpga card is provided control through labview program .",
    "the generated signals from fpga are appropriately amplified and used as trigger to various electronic devices such as power supplies , aoms , mechanical shutters , ccd cameras , rf synthesizers and other circuitries . for the fast switching of the current in the magnetic trap coils , an insulated gate bipolar transistor(igbt ) based switching circuitry",
    "is used , which provides a fast ( rise time @xmath20 2.5 ms ) switching of current in the coils .",
    "this circuitry also works after receiving an appropriate trigger pulse from the controller system .",
    "in the experiments , first event is the formation of vc - mot .",
    "the vapor of rb atoms is generated in the octagonal vc - mot chamber ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1expt_setup ] ) by passing a dc current of 3 - 4 a through the rb - getters inserted inside the chamber via a feed - through .",
    "a push laser beam is focussed on the vc - mot atom cloud to eject the atoms from this mot .",
    "the atoms ejected from the vc - mot pass through the differential pumping tube ( dpt ) and reach the glass cell where they are recaptured in the uhv - mot .",
    "the atoms in the uhv - mot undergo the mot compression , optical molasses and optical pumping stages , before trapping in the magnetic trap for evaporative cooling .",
    "a brief summary of sequence and duration of these processes and events during the experiments is presented as follows .",
    "\\(a ) vc - mot formation :    the rb - vapor is generated in the octagonal vc - mot chamber by passing a dc current of 2.7 - 3.5 a in the rb - getter strips .",
    "the rb - getter strips are fixed on a feed - through and inserted inside the chamber by mounting this feed - through on one of the ports of the octagonal vc - mot chamber .",
    "the three vc - mot beams , after making their cooling laser polarization circular using the quarter waveplates , are injected into the octagonal vc - mot chamber through three viewports .",
    "these beams are retro - reflected by the mirrors kept at the other end of the chamber near the exit viewports .",
    "after retro - reflection of these three vc - mot beams , six beams required for the mot operation are achieved . before retro - reflection from the mirror , each vc - mot beam passes through a quarter waveplate to maintain the desired polarization of the beam after retro - reflection .",
    "a dc current of @xmath13 3 a is passed through the vc - mot coils to generate the required magnetic field gradient of @xmath1312 g / cm for mot formation .",
    "the cooling laser frequency is locked at a side of the cooling transition ( with red detuning of @xmath132.5 @xmath22 ) whereas re - pumping laser is kept at the resonance of re - pumping transition of the @xmath4rb atom .",
    "after appropriate vapor pressure in the chamber ( @xmath23 torr ) and setting the laser beams frequency appropriately , we could trap @xmath24 @xmath4rb atoms in the vc - mot at temperature of @xmath13 300 @xmath25k .",
    "\\(b ) atom transfer and uhv - mot formation :    the atoms cooled and trapped in the vc - mot are utilized for loading the uhv - mot in the glass cell .",
    "the vc - mot and uhv - mot are separated by a distance of @xmath13 360 mm in our setup .",
    "the transfer of atoms from the vc - mot to the uhv - mot region , through the narrow differential pumping tube ( dpt ) , is an important step in loading the uhv - mot .",
    "it is always important to obtain the maximum number of atoms trapped in the uhv - mot .",
    "this atom transfer from vc - mot to uhv - mot has been studied in detail by our group @xcite as well as by other groups @xcite .",
    "the use of a red - detuned ( from cooling transition ) push laser beam of gaussian transverse profile is a very convenient method to transfer atoms from vc - mot to uhv - mot .",
    "such a push beam ejects atoms from vc - mot and provides transverse confinement ( i.e. guiding ) to atoms during their transfer from vc - mot to uhv - mot region .",
    "this guiding improves the number of atoms trapped in the uhv - mot as more atoms reach the uhv - mot volume . in our experiments ,",
    "a laser beam having @xmath1321 mw of power ( before entry into the vc - mot chamber ) and detuning @xmath13 1 ghz , focused to a @xmath26 radius of @xmath13 35 @xmath25 m on vc - mot atom cloud , is used as a push beam for the above atom transfer purpose . during the uhv - mot loading ,",
    "uhv - mot beams are kept on and appropriate current ( @xmath13 0.6 - 1.0 a ) is passed through the uhv - mot coils to generate the necessary field gradient for the mot formation . in our experiments ,",
    "the uhv - mot is loaded for @xmath13 40 s duration over which the push beam is kept on .",
    "nearly @xmath27 atoms are obtained in the saturated uhv - mot in our setup .",
    "the temperature of atom cloud in the uhv - mot ranges from 100 @xmath25k to 400 @xmath25k , depending upon the various parameters set in the experiments . the number and temperature of the atom clouds in both the mots are estimated using fluorescence imaging and free - expansion techniques @xcite",
    "\\(c ) uhv - mot compression and cooling in molasses :    after fully loading of uhv - mot , the uhv - mot atom cloud is kept in a compressed - mot for @xmath1320 ms duration .",
    "this is achieved by increasing the detuning of cooling laser beams for uhv - mot from @xmath28 and magnetic field gradient from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "the compressed mot stage results in a higher density in the mot cloud . at the end of the compressed mot stage , the current in the uhv - mot coils",
    "is switched - off and atoms are cooled in optical molasses for @xmath13 5 ms duration with reduced power ( to @xmath31 of original power ) and increased detuning ( @xmath13 42 mhz ) of uhv - mot cooling beams .",
    "after the optical molasses stage the temperature of atom cloud is obtained in the range of @xmath1340 - 80 @xmath25k .",
    "\\(d ) optical pumping :    the uhv - mot atom cloud after the molasses stage is optically pumped to @xmath32 zeeman hyperfine sublevel of @xmath4rb atom for magnetic trapping .",
    "this leads to an efficient transfer of atoms from molasses to magnetic trap .",
    "the optical pumping is accomplished in @xmath13 0.5 ms duration .",
    "for optical pumping , the atom cloud after molasses is exposed to a weak laser ( with @xmath33 polarization ) pulse of duration @xmath130.5 ms in presence of an uniform magnetic field of @xmath132 g. in order to optimize the optical pumping process , the power in optical pumping pulse can be varied ( while keeping the pulse duration fixed at @xmath13 0.5 ms ) and number of atoms in the magnetic trap can be monitored .",
    "fig.[fig : optical_pumping_optimization ] shows the variation in number of atoms captured in the quadrupole trap for different optical pumping power values . at optimized optical pumping power",
    ", we could transfer @xmath1330 - 40 @xmath34 of atoms from uhv - mot to quadrupole magnetic trap .",
    "this can be further improved by improving the optical pumping in our setup and by fast rise of current in the of quadrupole trap coils . at present , the optical pumping field is not a perfect rectangular pulse in shape and quadrupole magnetic field switching is also slow ( rise - time @xmath132.5 ms )    \\(e ) magnetic trapping :    the uhv - mot coils are used to form the quadrupole magnetic trap .",
    "the quadrupole coils and an ioffe coil form the desired quic trap when currents in these coils is set appropriately . for our quic trap ,",
    "the ioffe coil has 238 number of turns ( with 78 number of turns in the conical part and 160 number of turns in the cylindrical part ) .",
    "the conical section of the ioffe coil has a length of 16 mm with gradually increasing diameter ( from 6 mm to 35 mm ) and the cylindrical section is of length 18 mm with diameter 35 mm .",
    "the wire used in this coil has diameter @xmath20 1.0 mm .",
    "this specific design of ioffe coil has been chosen to make approach of the coil to the glass cell without blocking the uhv - mot beams .",

    "our measured field values are close to the calculated field values .",
    "we used these values during the experiments for quic trap formation .",
    "the trapping potential of the quic trap near the field minimum position @xmath35 can be approximately given as @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass of the atom , @xmath25 is magnetic dipole moment of the atom and @xmath38 is non - zero value of the field at the minimum of the trapping potential at @xmath35 .",

    "a logarithmic variation of rf frequency with time ( from high initial value to low final value ) , called rf scan , is implemented to achieve efficient evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "the useful frequency range for rf scan for rf - evaporation can be roughly estimated by knowing the variation of magnetic field with position in the trap ( to know the position dependent zeeman splitting ) and size of the atom cloud in the trap .",
    "the process of rf - evaporation is very sensitive to the final frequency in the scan range .",
    "after completion of the rf evaporative cooling by frequency scan of the rf field ( i.e. rf scan ) , the trapped atom cloud od images were obtained by in - situ absorption imaging using a near resonant probe beam ( pulse duration 60@xmath70 ) and imaging optics as discussed before .",
    "these images of evaporatively cooled cloud are recorded for different ranges of rf scan to find the appropriate scan range for effective evaporative cooling for bec phase transition .",
    "since imaging measurement heats up the sample , in order to record the image for the changed parameters , the trap is reloaded and evaporative cooling cycle is repeated again . because of the several steps involved in a cycle of the experiment , the recorded images show some cycle - to - cycle fluctuation in the number of atoms ( @xmath71 10 @xmath72 ) even without changing the experimental parameters .",
    "the evaporative cooling experiments are performed over a number of cycles to record the absorption images for different ranges of rf scan .",

    "the power of rf - field was @xmath136 - 8 w over these ranges .",
    "for some of rf scan ranges , the spatial profile of od becomes bimodal ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9_bimodal ] ) , with a sharp peak at the centre against a broad gaussian distribution at the skirts .",
    "this bimodal distribution indicates the on - set of bose - einstein condensation of atoms at the trap centre .",
    "this kind of bimodal distribution in od profile is a well known signature of occurrence of bec during the evaporative cooling experiments @xcite .",
    "we note that the bimodal spatial profile of od is observable only for appropriately chosen parameters during the rf evaporation experiments .",

    "[ fig : fig9_bimodal](c ) , these parameters are @xmath84 @xmath1 , @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    in the od images in which bimodal distribution is prominent , a halo surrounding the peak of od is observed .",
    "this halo region has negative od value ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11_negative_od ] ) , which implies a higher light intensity in this region in the probe beam image with atom cloud than the intensity in the probe image without atom cloud .",
    "similar halo region has been reported earlier @xcite and attributed to the diffraction of probe beam from the dense and spatially localised bose condensate cloud @xcite .",
    "the @xmath61 image profiles which do not show bimodal distribution , a negligible negative @xmath61 is observed ( as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11_negative_od ] ) .",
    "it is known that the size of cloud in the magnetic trap is dependent on its temperature @xcite .",
    "since the temperature of evaporatively cooled atom cloud is also dependent on the final value of rf frequency in the rf scan @xcite , we attempted to study the variation in the cooled atom cloud size with the value of final frequency in the rf scan .",
    "[ fig : sigma_xy ] shows the observed variation in the sizes of the thermal and condensate clouds with the value of final value of frequency in the rf scan . here",
    "sizes were estimated by fitting eq . [",

    "an example of the fitting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitted_profile ] . the data in the fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_xy ] shows the decrease in the thermal cloud size with decrease in the final frequency , before the appearance of the bimodal @xmath61 profile .",
    "when final frequency is reduced below a certain value , the @xmath61 profile becomes bimodal . in this bimodal distribution ,",
    "the size of condensate part is much smaller than the thermal part ( fig.[fig : fig9_bimodal ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of sudden decrease in the size of the cloud below the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "fig [ fig : sigma_xy](a ) shows that when condensate part appears in the @xmath61 profile , the condensate size starts increasing with decrease in the final frequency in the rf scan .",
    "this increase in the size can be attributed to the increased repulsive interactions in the condensate with increase in the number of atoms in the condensate , as has been discussed in ref .",
    "we note that increase in the condensate width with decrease in final frequency is more clearly observable along the weakly confining trap axis ( x - axis ) , as compared to the strongly confining y - axis .",
    "further , in the presence of the condensate , the size of thermal cloud also increases with decrease in the final frequency as we observed in our experiments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_xy ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the predictions made earlier @xcite that presence of condensate pushes the thermal cloud out .",
