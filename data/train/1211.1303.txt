    "hybridization of single - stranded nucleic acids to form a duplex is a reversible chemical reaction , which is at the basis of many processess and techniques currently used in biotechnology , as for instance pcr  @xcite . due to its central importance",
    ", hybridization has been intensively studied in experiments ( focusing on the thermodynamics  @xcite or kinetics of the process ) and also in computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of dna hybridization is usually described by the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) model  @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that the free energy of a duplex can be expressed as a sum of dinucleotide stability parameters ; it is therefore based on the principle of additivity . from the nn parameters one can",
    ", for instance , estimate melting temperatures , compute melting curves and predict secondary structures in which rna molecules fold  @xcite . in the folding problem , many different local conformations arise as single nucleotide mismatches , bulges , stem - loop structures , etc . describing these conformations in the framework of",
    "the nn model is very challenging and requires a large number of parameters  @xcite .",
    "however , only a limited number of them have been measured directly in experiments  @xcite .",
    "in addition , one may also wonder whether additivity holds in such cases . to investigate a large number of different conformations",
    ", it would be very advantageous to have access to high - throughput measurements , provided that they are sufficiently accurate .    in this article",
    ", we quantitatively determine free energy penalties for mismatches using microarray data obtained from a set of optimized and dedicated experiments . in dna microarrays ,",
    "several thousand of different sequences can be spotted at a surface , hence a large number of hybridization reactions takes place simultaneously .",
    "we use two different approaches : the first one is based on a linear regression of a large set of experimental data points ( @xmath1 ) to fit @xmath2 nn dinucleotide parameters .",
    "the second method relies on the computation of the logarithm of the ratios of fluorescent intensities measured from different spots of the arrays .",
    "we show that both methods provide highly correlated set of nn parameters .",
    "in addition , the second approach allows to probe the limitations of the nn model .",
    "it is found that when two mismatches are closer than @xmath0 nt additivity breaks down and the free energy of the duplex is not equal to the sum of the two separate contributions of isolated mismatches .",
    "we also quantify the influence of mismatches close to the edge of the double helix and show that the free energy penalty is much weaker in those cases .",
    "overall , this work provides new insights on dna hybridization thermodynamics and can help to increase the accuracy of hybridization - based technologies .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the experiments were performed on custom agilent arrays , following a standard protocol , which is discussed in  @xcite . in each experiment ,",
    "a single target sequence in solution was hybridized at concentrations ranging typically from @xmath3  picom to @xmath4  nanom . in total , three different sets of experiments were performed using the target sequences shown in table  [ tab01 ] .",
    "these sequences were selected from @xmath5-mers human dnas using optimal design methods  @xcite . the theory of optimal design provides some criteria of selecting an optimal set of measurements , which minimize the uncertainties in the parameters of a statistical model ( see supplementary data ) .    from the targets of table  [ tab01 ] ,",
    "three different microarrays were designed and used for hybridization to either @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "each microarray contains probes with either zero , one or two mismatches with respect to the given target , covering all possible mismatch combinations . in a stretch of @xmath9 nucleotides",
    "there can be @xmath10 single mismatch probes and @xmath11 double mismatch probes . for @xmath12",
    "this gives in total @xmath13 different sequences , which were spotted in the microarray .",
    "the sequences were replicated @xmath14 times to fill up completely a @xmath15k custom agilent array .",
    "another design was also used mismatches have a minimal distance of 4 nt from the border and a minimal relative distance of 5 nt . in this case",
    "the total number of sequences is @xmath16 .",
    "these sequences were replicated @xmath17 times to fill a 15k custom arrays .",
    "we considered hybridizing sequences of 25 nucleotides .",
    "this is because in previous studies  @xcite these sequences were found to attain thermodynamic equilibrium after @xmath18 h of hybridization ( in the experiments the hybridization time is of @xmath19 h , hence thermodynamic equilibrium is guaranteed ) .",
    "a hybridization experiment provides a large number of fluorescence intensities : the highest intensity is from spots containing perfect match sequence , whereas the intensity decreases with the number and type of mismatches .",
    "the reduction of the intensity provides an estimate of the hybridization free energy .",
    "we use two different methods to obtain the nn parameters , as discussed in the next sections .",
    "equilibrium thermodynamics predicts that the measured fluorescence intensity from a spot @xmath20 equals to : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hybridization free energy between the target sequence and a probe sequence in @xmath20 , @xmath23 is a parameter , which sets the intensity scale , @xmath24 the target concentration , @xmath25 the gas constant and @xmath26 the temperature ( experiments are performed at @xmath27c @xmath28 , which is the value of the temperature used in the rest of the analysis ) .",
    "although the data analyzed are background - subtracted from the agilent scanner , there remains always some small aspecific signals , which we denote by @xmath29 in equation  ( [ iivsdg ] ) . in the experiments @xmath30",
    "is obtained from the average over typically approximately @xmath14 replicated spots .",
    "one should note that equation  ( [ iivsdg ] ) is valid at sufficiently low target concentrations , i.e. when only a limited fraction of probes is hybridized in a spot , hence far from chemical saturation . on the other hand , at very low concentrations ,",
    "the specific signal , i.e. the second term in equation  ( [ iivsdg ] ) , can become comparable to @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , for the analysis of the data we restricted ourselves to intermediate concentrations and intensities for which we explicitly verified that the intensities scale linearly with concentrations , as predicted by equation  ( [ iivsdg ] ) ( more details can be found in the supplementary data ) . in the intensity scale of the experiments",
    "@xmath31 , whereas the values used in the analysis are @xmath32 .",
    "in practice , the large majority of the intensities in experiments with target concentration @xmath33  pm or higher are above this threshold value .    in the following",
    ", we will consider the logarithm of the intensities measured with respect to the perfect match ( pm ) intensity .",
    "using equation  ( [ iivsdg ] ) , for @xmath34 we get : @xmath35 which defines the free energy penalty of probe @xmath20 with respect to the perfectly matching probe .",
    "this penalty can be expressed as a sum of nn dinucleotide parameters .",
    "consider , for instance , the example of a probe @xmath20 with a single mismatch of type a with respect to the target nucleotide g and with neighboring nucleotides g and t. we have : @xmath36 we use the following notation : the target sequence is the bottom strand and the probe sequence , which is oriented from 5@xmath373 , is the top strand .",
    "this example corresponds to target @xmath38 or @xmath39 at position 10 , counting from 3 end ( the triplet of nucleotides are indicated in bold in table  [ tab01 ] ) . in equation  ( [ yi_eq2 ] )",
    "@xmath40 is defined as the free energy penalty of an isolated mismatch in a dna duplex .",
    "this penalty is expected to be a local effect . in the nn model",
    "this locality is inherent : the dots in equation  ( [ yi_eq2 ] ) indicate identical nucleotides in the two sequences , their contribution cancels out and leaves per isolated mismatch only four dinucleotide parameters around the mismatch position .",
    "there are in total only 58 such dinucleotide parameters : @xmath41 perfect match parameters and @xmath42 single mismatch parameters ( taking into account symmetries ) .",
    "the dinucleotide parameters are not directly experimentally accessible and are not unique  @xcite , e.g. they can be shifted by some constant value such that the physically accessible @xmath40 remains unchanged ( see supplementary data ) .",
    "pm from the experiments using hybridization of targets @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 , as a function of the @xmath40 parameters obtained from least - squared minimization .",
    "the data agree well with hybridization isotherm given in equation  ( [ yi_linear ] ) , shown as a straight line in the linear - log scale . ]",
    "equations  ( [ yi_linear ] ) and  ( [ yi_eq2 ] ) define a linear problem : each measured @xmath43 can be expressed by a linear combination of dinucleotide parameters . in order to extract the parameters from the data we combined the results of the three experiments and performed a least square minimization of equation  ( [ yi_linear ] ) .",
    "mismatches closer than five sites from the helix edges were excluded from the analysis , as well as pairs of mismatches with a distance smaller than 5 nt .",
    "the @xmath2 adjustable parameters were fitted on a set of about a thousand of experimental data points above the intensity threshold .",
    "the fitted parameters then applied to produce the plot as shown in figure  [ fig_fit_collapse ] for all available intensities of the experiments in which either sequence @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 was hybridized on its corresponding microarray at a concentration of @xmath33  pm . the data are plotted as a function of the unique @xmath40 for triplets defined as in equation  ( [ yi_eq2 ] ) .",
    "we note that there is very good agreement between the data and the thermodynamic model of equation  ( [ iivsdg ] ) .",
    "the experiments follow the equilibrium isotherm ( a straight line with a slope equal to @xmath44 ) for a range of intensities of more than four orders of magnitude",
    ". a previous study  @xcite in which hybridizing strands were 30-mers did not provide a single straight line in a @xmath45 versus @xmath40 plot .",
    "deviations due to lack of thermodynamic equilibrium were observed in the high - intensity ranges , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "further it is important to note that we do not only find internally consistent results , but that our microarray - derived free energy parameters also correlate to a fair degree with those reported in literature for hybridization in solution  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_array_vs_solution ] shows a correlation plot of the free energy penalties ( i.e. the @xmath46 defined as in the example of equation  ( [ yi_eq2 ] ) ) obtained from the microarray data analysis and those from santalucia et al . from  @xcite .",
    "the spearman correlation coefficient is equal to @xmath47 .",
    "this clearly shows that free energy parameters for dna features measured by the presented microarray approach also apply for thermodynamic properties in solution .",
    "this opens the highly parallelled microarray toolbox for the study of thermodynamics of dna structures .",
    "an example is discussed in the next section .     for triplets obtained from the microarray fit versus those from hybridization in solution  @xcite .",
    "the central mismatching nucleotides of the triplet ( underlined in equation  ( [ yi_eq2 ] ) ) are indicated in the plot . ]",
    "the crucial assumption of the nn model is additivity of local free energy contributions .",
    "we probe here the limits of additivity of free energy penalties as a function of the distance between two mismatches .",
    "we will access the free energy parameters by comparing ratios of intensities measured from different spots in the microarray .     and @xmath48 at positions",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , ( d ) hybridization with a probe carrying two mismatches .",
    "we use the notations @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 to denote the corresponding intensities measured in the experiment.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    hereto , we combine microarray spots that contain probes with zero , one or two mismatches with respect to the target and we denote the location of the mismatch by @xmath49 or @xmath54 as illustrated in figure  [ fig_mm_sketch ] .",
    "the associated free energy penalties can then be derived from the intensity measurements as follows @xmath55 in which the superscript @xmath56 and @xmath48 represent the three possible mismatching nucleotides at location @xmath49 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "if the additivity of the nn model holds , the free energy penalty of equation  ( [ eq penalty3 ] ) should equal the sum of the individual penalties of equations  ( [ eq penalty1 ] ) and ( [ eq penalty2 ] ) . to test this",
    ", we introduce @xmath58 which measures the relative deviation from additivity .",
    "figure  [ fig_interaction_alpha ] shows the experimental results for @xmath59 in which we averaged over @xmath49 , @xmath56 and @xmath48 , leaving @xmath59 as a function of the distance @xmath60 between two mismatches . from this data",
    ", we notice that @xmath59 has a value of about zero when the mismatches are separated by @xmath61 nt , but a clear positive value for smaller @xmath62 .",
    "apparently the free energy penalty of two nearby mismatches is smaller than the sum of the two individual contributions , resulting in a positive @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , the inset from figure  [ fig_interaction_alpha ] shows that the relationship is linear in a semi logarithmic plot , hence @xmath59 decays exponentially with @xmath60 . note that at @xmath63 only one mismatch is present , hence @xmath64 and @xmath59 will be identical to @xmath65 according to equation  ( [ eq alpha ] ) .",
    "all these observation result from direct measurement values , containing no fitting parameters and strongly suggest that in double - stranded dna , mismatches have a physical interaction with each other which decays exponentially to zero over a distance of about five nucleotides .",
    ", the relative deviation from additivity , from the experiment of target @xmath38 , averaged over @xmath66 and @xmath48 as a function of the distance @xmath60 between two mismatches .",
    "the inset shows the plot with @xmath59 in log scale.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    these results are setting some limitations on the additivity of the nn model .",
    "however , outside this interaction region of @xmath67 nt we expect the nn model to hold i.e. @xmath59 should be zero and mismatches can be considered as isolated",
    ". this can be explicitly checked in a very direct way .",
    "when @xmath68 we get from equation  ( [ eq alpha ] ) @xmath69 the free energy penalty @xmath70 of a mismatch @xmath56 at location @xmath49 , which we will call the focus mismatch @xmath71 , can be estimated either directly using equation  ( [ eq penalty1 ] ) or via a second mismatch @xmath72 using equations  ( [ eq penalty2 ] ) and ( [ eq penalty3 ] ) for any choice of @xmath48 and @xmath73 . hence , the free energy penalty of the focus mismatch can be estimated from measurements in many independent ways and they should provide the same answer if additivity holds . note",
    "that , using equations  ( [ eq penalty2 ] ) and ( [ eq penalty3 ] ) @xmath74 drops out in the right hand side of equation  ( [ direct ddg ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_median ] illustrates how equation  ( [ direct ddg ] ) can be used to estimate the @xmath40 using different combinations of @xmath48 and @xmath62 . in this specific example",
    "we consider @xmath75 which corresponds both for target @xmath38 and @xmath39 to @xmath76 ( in the supplementary data , we show other examples featuring additivity for different focus mismatches ) .    in the pane for target @xmath7 ,",
    "all the estimates of the free energy penalty are close the each other , the @xmath77 estimates tightly lie around a median value , in this case @xmath78 kcal / mol , indicated by the dotted line . the picture in the right pane is a typical one which we observe for any focus mismatch @xmath71 .",
    "this confirms that additivity holds in the regime @xmath79 , i.e. when mismatches are separated by @xmath80 nt .",
    "moreover , it shows that the microarray measurement is internally consistent .",
    "secondly , the left pane , i.e. experiment @xmath6 , provides the same median value for the free energy penalty , showing also the robustness of the microarray approach to estimate free energies of dna structures .",
    "however , this figure was chosen because it is atypical in the sense that one notices two pronounced outlying values .",
    "they correspond to a sequence where both the focus mismatch and the second mismatch are of type @xmath81 .",
    "since they clearly deviate from an otherwise nicely consistent picture , we believe there must a physically underlying reason for it .",
    "we will come back to this point in the section where we discuss thermodynamic outliers .",
    "note that with this second method we accessed values for the free energy penalties of isolated mismatches without using any multiple regression or fitting procedure , but we simply compared the ratios of intensities , equations  ( [ eq penalty1])-([eq penalty3 ] ) , to get a consistent set of independent estimates .",
    "the free energy penalties are then obtained from the median over all data points .",
    "we compared the free energy penalties obtained from this method ( median ) with those obtained from linear regression as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the two sets of data are well - correlated with a pearson correlation coefficient equal to @xmath82 ( see supplementary data ) .",
    "this correlation shows the equivalence of the two approaches . in this analysis , we restricted ourselves to mismatches in the bulk of the sequence , i.e. @xmath49 is @xmath83 nt from the border .",
    "closer to the border we observe boundary effects , which are covered in the next section .      the previous section ended by showing",
    "the equivalence of both approaches to access free energy penalties of an isolated mismatch , provided the data are restricted to bulk mismatches .",
    "the direct median method of the previous section can also assess penalties of mismatches close to the boundary , whereas on the contrary the fitting method can not by construction .",
    "the latter , however , has the advantage of fitting a full parameter set of the nn model and as such can easily provide bulk values for the free energy penalty of any isolated mismatch .",
    "the combination of both methods now provides an elegant way to assess the effect of boundary proximity on an isolated mismatch .",
    "hereto , we introduce the parameter @xmath84 as the relative reduction of free energy penalty of a mismatch when compared to its bulk value .",
    "@xmath85    , the relative reduction of mismatch free energy penalty , as a function of location for experiment with target @xmath6 .",
    "each point is the average of three estimates , one per possible mismatch .",
    "data are absent for the extremal locations @xmath86 and @xmath87 , since no value can be calculated by the nn model . ]    in figure  [ fig boundary ] the parameter @xmath84 is shown as a function of @xmath49 after averaging over @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear that , as expected , @xmath84 is approximately equal to one in the bulk , whereas when approaching the boundary , a reduction of free energy penalty occurs which reaches up to 80% .",
    "note that for mismatches at the boundary , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the nn model is not applicable and no data is presented .",
    "figure  [ fig boundary ] show that the range of the boundary effect is @xmath88 nt .      as a final result of this article",
    ", we come back to the two outliers observed in figure  [ fig_median](a ) ; the same deviations are found in replicated experiments at different concentrations : therefore , they are unlikely due to experimental errors . for these two cases",
    "we find @xmath89 kcal / mol and @xmath90 kcal / mol , strongly deviating from the median value ( @xmath91  kcal / mol ) .",
    "the common feature of these two sequences is that they involve ga mismatches .",
    "the two set of mismatches are arranged in an antiparallel way i.e. one g and one a are on the same strand .",
    "mismatches of ga type in dna and rna helices have been the subject of several studies in the past   @xcite . in the rna folding",
    ", it is known that ga pairs contribute substantially to the rna helix stability .",
    "their contribution is comparable to that of a canonical at pair .",
    "as at pairs , ga form two hydrogen bonds , but can also assume four different conformations  @xcite .",
    "the microarray data suggest that the antiparallel combination of ga and ag pairs of mismatches have a long range interaction effect , which is probably a signature of some structural conformational change of a double helix containing these pairs .",
    "next - nearest neighbor effects extending up to @xmath67 nt distance for antiparallel ga mismatches have been reported in the case of rna duplexes in  @xcite ( longer distances were not considered that case ) .",
    "we investigated antiparallel ga and ag pairs of mismatches also in sequences @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but found no anomalous behavior in those cases .",
    "this suggests that the nucleotide sequences between the two @xmath92 pairs plays an important role in the overall stability of the duplex .    as a further proof of the outlying behavior of antiparallel @xmath92 pairs we show in figure  [ fig_tandem ] a plot of free energy penalties for tandem mismatches ( neighboring double mismatches )",
    "these are again obtained from equation  ( [ eq penalty3 ] ) for different @xmath56 and @xmath48 mismatching nucleotides , where in the case of tandem mismatches , @xmath62 is equal to 1 . on each location of the sequence our data set",
    "contains nine different types of tandem mismatch .",
    "a clear boundary effect is noticeable , but when looking at the bulk data points tandem mismatch of the type @xmath92 are again outlying , they appear to be particularly stable with a free energy penalty @xmath93 kcal / mol below average .",
    "in this article , we have analyzed dna hybridization reactions in microarrays and quantified free energy penalties of single and double mismatches .",
    "we have shown that the experimental data are very precise and reproducible .",
    "the microarray data follow an equilibrium isotherm over a range of four orders of magnitude in the fluorescence intensities and allow the extraction of accurate thermodynamic parameters .",
    "first , the analysis provides a database with a large number of nn parameters for isolated mismatches .",
    "these parameters correlate well with those reported in the literature from hybridization experiments in solution .",
    "second , the experiments contain systematic measurements of hybridization with two mismatches , which allowed us to probe the validity limit of the nn approximation .",
    "we showed that when two mismatches are separated by a distance of @xmath61 nt their effect is additive , allowing a standard approach with the nn model .",
    "however , for shorter distances , the additivity is no longer valid and we found that duplexes with neighboring mismatches are more stable than expected from additivity .",
    "this interaction was shown to decay exponentially as a function of the distance between mismatches .",
    "further , we investigated the behavior of mismatches close to the helix edges , and showed that their free energy penalty is reduced up to @xmath94 when compared to the bulk behavior .",
    "the boundary effect was observable up to @xmath67 nt from the helix edge .",
    "finally , we also found some thermodynamic outliers , sequences involving two antiparallel ga mismatches , in which the mismatch interaction appears to persist beyond @xmath0 nt .",
    "these outliers were not related to experimental error indicating a signature of some structural conformational change of a double helix containing these mismatch pairs .",
    "overall , the analysis of the microarray data reported in this article provides new quantitative insights on the dna hybridization parameters , on the nn model and its present limitations .",
    "our study is in line with a number of recent articles , which have been dedicated to the investigations of fundamental physico - chemical properties of dna arrays  @xcite . due to the relevance of hybridization in many technologies ,",
    "going from pcr  @xcite to recent developments in biosensors , e.g.  @xcite , a good thermodynamic model is also important from the application point of view .",
    "a precise quantification of interaction free energies involved in the hybridization will help to increase the accuracy of microarrays and other hybridization - based technologies , so that these devices could realize their full potential , for instance , for clinical applications  @xcite .",
    "for these applications , an increase in specificity and sensitivity is very important and can be achieved through better understanding of fundamental properties of hybridization in these devices .",
    "there has been considerable attention in recent years  @xcite in understanding the fundamentals of hybridization in dna microarrays and its impact in data analysis .",
    "here , we have shown that microarrays are a reliable and high - throughput tool to gain insight on dna hybridization thermodynamics .",
    "the same method could be used to screen other types of defects , as bulges .",
    "indeed , it was recently used for understanding loop conformations  @xcite .",

    "according to the nearest - neighbor model , the total hybridization free energy of a target to a probe can be expressed as a sum of the dinucleotide parameters @xmath96 accounting for hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions .",
    "the index @xmath59 covers all possible dinucleotide parameters .",
    "some examples are : @xmath97 where the underlined nucleotides indicate mismatches . in total",
    "there are @xmath41 perfect match parameters ( taking into account symmetries ) and @xmath42 parameters in the case of a single mismatch .",
    "these dinucleotide parameters are known not to be unique , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thermodynamics predicts that the intensity measured from a spot @xmath30 is given by : @xmath98 where @xmath22 is the total hybridization free energy between a target and a probe , @xmath23 is a parameter which sets the intensity scale , @xmath24 the target concentration , @xmath25 the gas constant and @xmath26 the temperature .",
    "@xmath29 is the aspecific signal that can be considered as background . in this paper",
    "the stability of duplexes was always compared to that of the perfect match , i.e. @xmath99 which defines the free energy penalty of probe @xmath20 with respect to the perfectly matching probe .",
    "this penalty can be expressed as a sum of nearest - neighbor dinucleotide parameters : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the frequency matrix , which counts the number of times a given dinucleotide term contributes to @xmath43 . as an example , for an isolated mismatch of type ga we have : @xmath102 for notational convenience we used , by symmetry , the equality of @xmath103 to have the mismatch on the right hand side of the dinucleotide . for any given @xmath20 , the matrix elements @xmath104",
    "are all zero except for the four dinucleotide terms of equation  ( [ yi_eq2_supp ] ) which contribute by @xmath105 for the two dinucleotides with mismatches and @xmath106 for the two perfect matching dinucleotides .",
    "equation  ( [ lin_prob_suppl ] ) defines a multiple linear regression , from which the @xmath2 dinucleotide parameters can be fitted to match all the observed free energy penalties of mismatches .",
    "note that it defines the dinucleotide parameters not in a unique way , e.g. the following transformation @xmath107 in which the same constant @xmath108 is added and subtracted to different dinucleotide parameters , leaves equation  ( [ yi_eq2_supp ] ) invariant .",
    "the triplet parameters , such as defined in the last line of equation  ( [ yi_eq2_supp ] ) are however unique as expected , since they are directly physically accessible .",
    "as discussed above , the dinucleotide parameters can be obtained from a linear fit from @xmath9 independent experimental measurements .",
    "such an approach always contains some uncertainties .",
    "these uncertainties can be lowered if one takes @xmath9 large . in our specific case @xmath9",
    "equals the number of spots on the microarrays , and can be increased by combining data from more arrays ( see main paper for experimental setup ) .",
    "further , for a given fixed value of @xmath9 one can use some optimization criterion to select the best @xmath9 measurements which minimize the uncertainties on fitted parameters . in our case",
    "this comes down to the selection of a target sequence with good statistical properties .",
    "the theory of _ optimal design _ establishes some criteria for this purpose and we briefly discuss this theory here .    before entering into the details of the optimization followed in the microarray experiment",
    "we discuss a one dimensional example , which illustrates the optimization method .",
    "let us take the example of a simple linear regression with an intersect set to zero ( corresponding to a one - dimensional system ) : @xmath109 where @xmath84 is the unknown of the problem , @xmath110 and @xmath43 are respectively the input and output of the experiment @xmath20 and can take any real value .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 can be obtained by the least square method  : @xmath111 where the symbol @xmath112 means the average over the @xmath9 elements .",
    "the error on @xmath84 is given by  : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the cost function of the system .",
    "equation  ( [ costfunc ] ) implies that the error can be decreased by enlarging the sampled points ( @xmath9 ) or , for @xmath9 fixed , by increasing the variance of the variable @xmath110 .",
    "the latter criterion can be used in the design of the experiment by performing measurements @xmath43 for a well spread set of points @xmath110 .",
    "indeed , it is intuitively clear that when @xmath110 are very close to each other ( small variance ) one has a large uncertainty on the estimate of the slope @xmath84 . in what follows",
    "we discuss about optimal design criteria in higher dimensions , which roughly correspond to the idea of the maximization of the variance in the previous one - dimensional example .",
    "we define first the so - called _ information matrix _ @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the frequency matrix defined in equation  ( [ lin_prob_suppl ] ) and where @xmath117 denotes its transpose . in terms of matrix elements : @xmath118 which is thus in our case a square symmetric matrix of dimension @xmath119 .",
    "the information about the quality of the experimental design is encoded in @xmath120 and in our case is defined by the sequence of the target oligo in the experiment ( see main paper for experimental setup ) .",
    "the three most used criteria in optimal design are the a- , d- and e - optimality .",
    "a - optimality corresponds to minimizing the trace of @xmath121 , d - optimality corresponds to minimizing the determinant of @xmath121 and e - optimality corresponds to maximizing the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath120 . roughly speaking , these strategies amounts to maximize the information encoded in @xmath120  @xcite .",
    "we note that in the linear problem of equation  ( [ lin_prob_suppl ] ) the information matrix has a minimum of @xmath122 null eigenvalues ( see the supplementary material of ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "these come from unavoidable degeneracies of the problem , or equivalently from the fact that the dinucleotide parameters are not unique ( see e.g. equations  ( [ shift1_suppl ] ) and ( [ shift2_suppl ] ) ) . having some zero eigenvalues , the information matrix @xmath120 is not invertible , therefore we are working with pseudo - inverse which is obtained from the singular value decomposition of @xmath120 .",
    "the three target sequences , @xmath123 and @xmath8 , which were used for the experiments and which are mentioned in table 1 of the main article were selected as follows .",
    "we collected a set of candidate targets by scanning over a piece of the human genome and taking subsequences of length 25 .",
    "the first criterion was to choose sequences with minimum , unavoidable , number of 7 zero eigenvalues in order to get the minimum number of degeneracies when solving the linear system to estimate the nearest - neighbor parameters , as discussed above . for @xmath6",
    ", we considered a subset of sequences with a minimum distance of 3 nucleotides from the border and a minimum distance of 3 nucleotides between 2 mismatches . for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the minimal distance from the border",
    "is 4 nucleotides and the distance between 2 mismatches is at least 5 nucleotides .",
    "therefore , the constraint on the subset to select @xmath6 was weaker than @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "since the constraint for @xmath7 and @xmath8 is stronger than @xmath6 , in this case , the number of equations in the linear system is lower and it is more difficult to find subsequences of length 25 which display the minimum number of 7 zero eigenvalues . for the same order of calculation",
    ", we managed to find 130 sequences for @xmath6 and only a few sequences for @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for @xmath6 , this set of candidates",
    "was subsequently ranked according to the three optimal design criteria a , d and e. finally , the candidate targets which ended up as top - ranked on all three criteria were retained .",
    "moreover , we checked the energy for the target to fold on itself .",
    "for the 3 targets , it takes a reasonable value .",
    ", @xmath124 , as a function of the intensity @xmath125 .",
    "the used target concentrations are @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 of target @xmath7 . ]    as a measurement device the microarray technology is faced with a detection limit in the low measurement regime and a saturation in the high end : see sketch in figure  [ fig_linear_sketch ] . in our research we want to limit ourselves to measurements in the linear regime .",
    "to assess which data meet this requirement we combine experiments which are identical ( identical target sequence , identical probe sets , identical hybridisation conditions ) except for the concentration @xmath129 of the target . if the data is in the linear regime we expect the intensity of a spot @xmath20 of the experiment with target concentration @xmath129 to be @xmath130 if we now combine two experiments , one with target concentration @xmath129 and one with @xmath124 , and define for each spot @xmath20 the quantity @xmath25 as @xmath131 than we expect @xmath25 to be equal to @xmath132 when both intensities are in the linear regime",
    ". however for low @xmath129 the spot intensity @xmath125 can be close to detection limit and consequently be higher than predicted by the theory of equation  ( [ i_i ] ) , or for high @xmath133 the intensity @xmath134 can be close to saturation and consequently lower than theoretically expected . in both cases",
    "@xmath25 will be above one .",
    "the result of this analysis is shown in figure  [ fig_linear_regime ] for the combinations @xmath135 and @xmath136 of target @xmath7 . from this picture",
    "it is clear that for a large part of the intensity range @xmath25 equals one and supports the linear regime . for the green dots ,",
    "there is a deviation in the high intensity range due to the proximity of saturation of these spots in the @xmath137 experiment .",
    "for the red dots a deviation is present due to proximity of the detection limit for these spots in the @xmath138 data .",
    "this approach gives a criterion to assess the validity of the linear regime per spot and the possibility to make a correction for the non - linear behaviour close to saturation or detection limit .",
    "in the main article the additivity of free energy penalties of mismatches was shown when mismatches were separated by more than four nucleotides . for two examples , this",
    "was explicitly shown in figure 5 of the main article . in this section",
    "we add some further examples of the additivity with similar plots .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ fig_additivity ] .    ) . ]",
    "in the main article we present two different approaches that can be used to estimate free energy penalties of single mismatches in a triplet of nucleotides such as in equation  ( 3 ) of the main article . the first method , i.e. by linear fitting , produces a robust estimation provided that each of the 58 nn dinucleotide parameters are equally well - represented .",
    "this was achieved by the use of optimal design principle in designing the experiments .",
    "another method is by taking the median of data points from ratios of intensities following equations  ( 4)-(6 ) of the main article .",
    "figure  [ fig_additivity ] of this document shows six of these unique triplets in which the free energy penalties are indicated by the horizontal line from taking the median of each independent estimates .",
    "it is then imperative to see if these two methods are equivalent in providing the estimates .",
    "figure  [ fig_median_vs_fit ] shows that the free energy penalties calculated from the two methods are well - correlated with pearson correlation @xmath82 ( such as mentioned in the main article ) .",
