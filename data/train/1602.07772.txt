    "the mid - infrared ( ir ) data for nearby early - type galaxies ( etgs ) become increasingly important because many observational data of etgs show a clear excess over stellar photospheric emission at 8@xmath324 @xmath10 m ( e.g. , knapp et al . 1992 ; athey et al . 2002 ; bressan et al .",
    "2006 ; ko et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 , 2013 ; shim et al . 2011",
    "; hwang et al . 2012 ; martini et al . 2013 ; rampazzo et al . 2013 ) . in old stellar systems ( i.e. , etgs ) ,",
    "the most likely origin of such mid - ir excess is circumstellar dust around asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. , bressan et al .",
    "1998 ; piovan et al . 2003 ; villaume et al .",
    "for example , villaume et al . (",
    "2015 ) showed that @xmath11 mid - ir photometric and spectroscopic data for etgs ( from martini et al .",
    "2013 and rampazzo et al .",
    "2013 ) are well explained by their agb dust model in the wavelength range where there are no emission lines .",
    "they also show that dust models without agb dust can not fit to the mid - ir data for etgs detected at 70 and 160 @xmath10 m .",
    "although the detailed contribution of agb dust to the mid - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a galaxy is not well understood yet ( e.g. , kelson & holden 2010 ; melbourne & boyer 2013 ) , recent models consistently suggest that the mid - ir emission from agb dust could be a proxy for the existence of intermediate - age stars in old stellar systems with little diffuse dust .",
    "this is because the mid - ir sed is very sensitive to the ( even small ) amount of stellar mass formed within @xmath70.3@xmath33 gyr , allowing us to trace recent star formation ( e.g. , see villaume et al .",
    "2015 and references therein )",
    ". however , to better understand the mid - ir excess emission of etgs , it is necessary to quantify the amount of intermediate - age stars in etgs where the mid - ir emission is attributed to agb dust .",
    "the most promising way is to investigate their stellar populations derived from age - sensitive features in optical absorption line spectroscopy ( e.g. , temi et al . 2005 ; bregman et al .",
    "2006 ; conroy et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "ko et al . ( 2013 ; hereafter ko13 ) studied the mid - ir properties of local etgs on the optical red sequence .",
    "we found that around half of 648 quiescent red - sequence galaxies have mid - ir excess emission over the stellar component .",
    "if we consider only bright ( @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath321.5 ) etgs , the fraction of mid - ir excess is still 39% .",
    "we also found that the etgs with mid - ir excess have the strength of the 4000  break slightly smaller than those without mid - ir excess ( i.e. , existence of more young stars ) .",
    "however , we did not find any significant difference in balmer absorption line index h@xmath6 between the two because the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of each individual sdss spectrum is not high enough to examine the difference .",
    "here we use the etg sample of ko13 to quantify the amount of intermediate - age stars ; we perform a stellar population analysis of the stacked sdss spectra of these etgs . we focus on the mid - ir excess of etgs and quantify the amount of intermediate - age stars through a stellar population analysis of the sdss stacked spectra .",
    "if the mid - ir emission of etgs is produced by intermediate - age stars formed within the last 1@xmath35 gyr , the absorption features in the optical spectra can provide important information on the age of their stars .",

    "the three subclasses can be summarised as follows .",
    "@xmath21 etgs with near - uv excess and mid - ir excess ( ` neme ' in fig .",

    "therefore , most galaxies in this subclass are indeed quiescent .    for comparison , we also show e+a galaxies from choi et al .",

    "we fix the age and metallicity distributions of the templates to the ones in figure 5 .",
    "the plot again shows that the mass fractions of young and intermediate - age stars do not differ much ; they are in the range @xmath74@xmath311% .",
    "although the optical spectra of the etgs in our sample do not show any features of star - forming galaxies , there could still be a contribution to the mid - ir excess emissions from deeply embedded sources ( e.g. , small , dense , central disks ) .",

    "this suggests that most etgs with mid - ir excess emission are not dusty , star - forming systems . instead , their mid - ir excess emission results probably from the existence of young / intermediate age stars .",

    "there could be several explanations why neme galaxies have stronger nuv emission than nnme galaxies even though the stellar populations from the spectra show no significant difference between the two .",

    "2009 ) in the outer regions could make the overall nuv@xmath8 color bluer ( assuming an inside - out behavior of recent star formation ) . in this case",
    ", galaxies with strong uv emission in the outer regions could be detected as neme galaxies , but those with weak uv emission in the outer regions would be classified as nnme galaxies ( e.g. , partial recent star formation ; jeong et al . 2009 ) . however , the spectral features of neme and nnme galaxies could be similar because the optical spectra probe only the central regions where recent star formation occurs around 1 gyr ago in both populations . the reason why neme and nnme galaxies have different uv emissions in the outer regions could be because nnme galaxies are more evolved systems than neme galaxies . in other words ,",
    "neme galaxies have bluer nuv@xmath8 colors because of recent star formation occurred within @xmath71 gyr in the outer regions ; nnme galaxies have relatively red nuv@xmath8 colors because near - uv excess fades with time ( i.e. , more than @xmath71 gyr after star formation stops ) , but they still show mid - ir excess because of intermediate - age stars .",
    "second , if the dust attenuation effects are not negligible ( particularly for nnme ) or / and dust geometry is different between the two , the different nuv@xmath8 colors can result from localized dust absorption . in this case ,",
    "nnme galaxies probably contain dusty regions mixed with young stars .",
    "then their overall nuv@xmath8 colors can not be bluer because of dust attenuation even if the amount of young stars in nnme galaxies is similar to that in neme galaxies .",

    "these suggest that the mid - ir emission can be a useful diagnostic tool for probing young and intermediate - age stars in etgs .",
    "actually there are various mechanisms that could contribute to the mid - ir emission in galaxies ( draine & li 2007 ; da cunha et al .",
    "this includes the sf driven dust continuum and pah emissions ( smith et al . 2007 ;",
    "rieke et al .",
    "2009 ) , agn heated hot dust continuum ( netzer et al .",
    "2007 ; mullaney et al . 2011 ) , and agb dust emission ( bressan et al . 1998 ; piovan et al . 2003 ) . because we removed the galaxies with star formation and nuclear activity from our sample ( see section 2.1 ) ,",
    "the contribution from the star formation and nuclear activity to the mid - ir emission is negligible in our sample .",
    "this is also supported by that the majority ( i.e. , 122 out of 145 ) of the etgs with mid - ir excess emission are not detected at 22 @xmath10 m ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the fit to the stacked spectra with a spectral fitting code , starlight , shows that the mass fraction of @xmath71@xmath35 gyr stars in the etgs with mid - ir excess is @xmath74@xmath311% and the light fraction is up to @xmath39 .",
    "it should be noted that the mass fraction of @xmath71@xmath35 gyr stars could be smaller than the current estimates ( i.e. , 4@xmath311% ) if the metallicity of etgs is very low ( e.g. , z@xmath20.004 ) .",
    "it is because the contribution of intermediate - age ( i.e. , 1@xmath35 gyr ) agb stars to the mid - ir emission becomes small in a very low metallicity tail ( e.g. , villaume et al .",

    "<S> we present a stellar population analysis of quiescent ( without h@xmath0 emission ) and bright ( @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath321.5 ) early - type galaxies ( etgs ) with recent star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the etgs are selected from a spectroscopic sample of sdss galaxies at 0.04 @xmath2 @xmath4 @xmath2 0.11 with _ </S>",
    "<S> wise _ mid - infrared ( ir ) and _ galex _ near - ultraviolet ( uv ) emissions . </S>",
    "<S> we stack the optical spectra of etgs with different amounts of mid - ir and near - uv excess emissions to measure the strength of 4000  break @xmath54000 and the width of balmer absorption line h@xmath6 that are indicative of recent ( @xmath71 gyr ) star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> the _ wise _ [ 3.4]@xmath3[12 ] colors show stronger correlations with the spectral features than nuv@xmath8 colors . </S>",
    "<S> we fit to the stacked spectra with a spectral fitting code , starlight , and find that the mass fraction of young ( @xmath91 gyr ) and intermediate - age ( @xmath71@xmath35 gyr ) stars in the etgs with mid - ir excess emission is @xmath74@xmath311% , depending on the template spectrum used for the fit . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that the etgs with mid - ir excess emission have experienced star formation within the last 1@xmath35 gyr and that the mid - ir emission is a useful diagnostic tool for probing recent star formation activity in etgs . </S>"
