    "the stability assessment of complex , interconnected systems such as technical infrastructure networks for data , traffic or electrical power requires the understanding of the failure - spreading mechanisms in such systems  @xcite . in one common scenario , failures propagate via the successive overloading of the elements forming the system : an initial damage leads to an increased stress on the remaining , undamaged parts of the system , thereby inducing subsequent failures .",
    "ultimately , such a failure cascade might lead to a total breakdown  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , one of the most important quantities influencing the system stability is the post - failure load redistribution , i.e. , how the failing load influences the other elements .",
    "this load - redistribution , of course , depends on the specific system . in the present work",
    ", we shall consider a model where the loads are given by currents across bonds in a resistor network so that the load redistribution after removing one bond is determined by kirchoff s circuit laws .",
    "it will turn out that the current redistribution in such networks can be described by a linear rule of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , refer to the current across the bond  @xmath4@xmath5 after and before the failure of bond  @xmath6@xmath7 with current  @xmath8 . the _ current - redistribution factors _  @xmath9 reflect the influence the failing bond has on the currents flowing through the remaining bonds .",
    "we will show that the @xmath9 are independent of the pre - failure currents and thus only depend on the topology of the network and the value of the bond resistances .",
    "our motivation behind the study of resistor networks is manifold : firstly , within the so - called dc power - flow approximation , which is commonly used also in practical applications , the calculation of the flows in an ac power transmission grid can be mapped to the calculation of currents in a resistor network  @xcite . the stability of power grids with respect to a cascading overloading of its transmission lines is thus linked to that of the corresponding resistor network   are commonly referred to as line - outage distribution factors . ] .    secondly , an arbitrary weighted graph can be interpreted as a resistor network  with resistances equal to the weights .",
    "an analysis of the current redistribution and , in particular , of the redistribution factors  @xmath9 in resistor networks can thus give us insight into the structure and topology of the corresponding weighted graphs .",
    "a commonly investigated quantity in such graphs is the so - called two - point resistance , which turns out to correspond directly to a distance measure between arbitrary nodes of the graph , the so - called resistance distance  @xcite . for graphs with an underlying `` geometrical '' structure ,",
    "the resistance distance has been analyzed , e.g. , by cserti  @xcite . by using lattice green functions",
    ", cserti calculates the two - point resistance @xmath10 between arbitrary nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 in infinite @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic , rectangular , triangular and honeycomb lattices . in particular , the dependence of @xmath10 on the spatial distance between nodes is analyzed in detail for a square lattice , and the asymptotic form of @xmath10 for large separations between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is determined .",
    "korniss et al .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , study the behavior of @xmath10 in small - world resistor networks and derive an expression for the asymptotic behavior of the disorder - averaged two - point resistance .",
    "in some sense complementary to the two - point resistance and other node - centric measures , the redistribution factors  @xmath9 provide information about the influence between two arbitrary edges  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we shall consider regular as well as small - world resistor networks and investigate how the current redistribution factors  @xmath9 depend on the distance @xmath0 between the edges @xmath4@xmath5 and @xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "an equally important aspect of our present investigations is the statistics of the current - redistribution factors  @xmath9 in different network topologies .",
    "our corresponding interest is motivated by our recent study  @xcite , where we have introduced and analyzed a new class of stochastic load - redistribution models for cascading failure propagation . in these models ,",
    "the load of a failing element is redistributed according to a load - redistribution rule of the form of eq .   but interpreted in a stochastic sense , i.e. , the current - redistribution factors are assumed to be random variables , drawn independently from a given distribution @xmath11 . in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have considered a very simple , generic model for a power grid by assuming a bimodal distribution of the @xmath12-values .",
    "one of the main aspects of the present work is thus to obtain a better understanding of the statistics of the current redistribution in different network topologies .    that such a stochastic model can indeed describe important stability properties of a system has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the fracture of materials has been analyzed by means of a fiber bundle model with a stochastic stress redistribution of the form of eq .   that had been obtained from a distance - dependent stress redistribution rule studied previously in ref .",
    "one of the main quantities of interest in this case is the critical stress above which the material breaks down . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a transition from a short- to a long - range behavior has been observed numerically as a function of a parameter characterizing the range of the redistribution . within our stochastic model ,",
    "we were able to trace back this transition to a change in the statistics of the stress redistribution .",

    "[ sec : crdf ] , we briefly discuss the calculation of current redistribution factors and , in particular , refer to an interesting and very useful relation that expresses @xmath9 in terms of two - point resistances @xmath13 .",

    "[ sec : lattice ] , we will present our analytical and numerical results for the behavior of the current redistribution in regular one- , two- , and three - dimensional networks . as any failure in a one - dimensional chain trivially leads to the breakdown of the entire current flow , we consider in sec .",

    "in the following , we consider a resistor network consisting of a set of nodes  @xmath4 connected by bonds  @xmath4@xmath5 with resistances  @xmath14 . at every node , we allow for current injection or extraction , which is described by a vector  @xmath15 with components @xmath16 , where @xmath17 @xmath18 for injection ( extraction ) or zero otherwise .",
