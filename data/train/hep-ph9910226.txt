    "the progress in experimental studies of separated quark and gluon jets is very impressive  @xcite . their separation has become possible due to new methods and high statistics at the @xmath3 resonance , which also allows the selection of jets with different sub - energies .",
    "therefore the detailed study of the energy evolution of such properties of jets as their average multiplicities and widths has also become possible .",
    "it is well known that the average multiplicities of quark and gluon jets increase quite rapidly with energy but their ratio has a much slower dependence and tends to a constant in asymptotics .",
    "the energy dependence of this ratio and of the ratio of the derivatives of mean multiplicities is of much debate nowadays , with new experimental data appearing rather regularly .",
    "the experimental procedure of the jet separation , the scale choice , and the manner in which soft particles are ascribed to jets , is often disputable , however .",
    "therefore , in the following , we do not insist upon a direct quantitative comparison of data with theory but rather describe the correspondence between our present experimental and theoretical findings with the purpose of finding quantities sensitive to areas of disagreement",
    ".    on the theoretical side , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) provides quite definite predictions which can be confronted to experiment .",
    "the asymptotical value of the ratio of average multiplicities in gluon and quark jets equals 2.25  @xcite , much larger than its experimental values which range from about 1.04 at the comparatively low energies of the @xmath4 resonance  @xcite to about 1.5 at the @xmath3 resonance  @xcite .",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections to this ratio @xmath5 ( we call them nlor ) reduce it from its asymptotical value by about 10@xmath6 at the @xmath3 energy  @xcite . the next order nnlor terms diminish it further , although calculations by different methods  @xcite lead to different results as we discuss later .",
    "we have calculated the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( 3nlor ) terms using qcd equations for the generating functions .",
    "the 3nlor terms are small but nonetheless provide an improved description of data , as shown below .    the computer solution of qcd equations for the generating functions has shown even better agreement with experiment for this ratio  @xcite , and excellent agreement for higher moments of the multiplicity distributions as well  @xcite . being perfect at the @xmath3 energy , the agreement for the ratio is less good at the @xmath4 resonance where the theoretical curve is 15 - 20@xmath6 above the experimental result ( see fig .  2 in  @xcite ) . in other words , the theoretically predicted _ slope of",
    "the ratio _ of multiplicities in gluon and quark jets is noticeably smaller than its experimental value .",
    "nonetheless , there has been a steady convergence of theory and experiment as more accurate calculations and more sophisticated measurements have become available .",
    "moreover , it is even surprising that any agreement is achieved given that the expansion parameter is extremely large ( about  0.5 ) at present energies .",
    "recently , experimental data about _ the ratio of slopes _ of average multiplicities in gluon and quark jets have been reported  @xcite and the corresponding analytical expressions have been calculated  @xcite .",
    "the importance of studying the slopes stems from the fact that some of them are extremely sensitive to higher order perturbative corrections , and to nonperturbative terms at available energies , as is discussed below .",
    "thus they provide an opportunity to learn more about the structure of the perturbative series from experiment .    the experimental group  @xcite claims that it is possible to simultaneously describe the scale dependence of multiplicities in gluon and quark jets only if nonperturbative effects contribute constant terms to the multiplicities .",
    "we examine this issue .",
    "the success of the computer solution suggests an alternative possibility , namely that a combination of nonperturbative terms which rapidly decrease with increasing energy and higher order perturbative terms can describe the data , effectively replacing the constant offsets assumed in  @xcite . to verify this",
    ", one needs analytical calculations of the corrections for experimental quantities most sensitive to them . with this aim in mind ,",
    "we consider analytical expressions for the above ratios , as well as for the ratio of the second derivatives ( curvatures ) of average multiplicities .",
    "these last ratios have not yet been measured .",
    "the general problem of perturbative and nonperturbative terms in the qcd equations for the generating functions is also addressed using simple analytical estimates .",
    "these estimates show that , at asymptotically high energies , the role of the nonperturbative region is not as important as the higher order perturbative terms but that it becomes more important at lower energies .",
    "the location of the borderline depends on the quantity under consideration .    for the comparison of theory with data",
    ", we utilize the principle of local parton hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite , i.e.  the hypothesis that a hadron distribution ( experiment ) can be related to a parton distribution ( theory ) by a simple normalization constant .",
    "lphd has been shown to be reliable for distributions dominated by soft particles , such as the multiplicity related quantities studied here ( for a fuller discussion , see  @xcite ) .",
    "in perturbative qcd , the general approach to studying multiplicity distributions is formulated in the framework of equations for generating functions ( for reviews see  @xcite ) . from the generating functions ,",

    "this difference , being negligible at high energies @xmath31 , becomes more important at low energies .",
    "moreover , it is of physical significance . with limits of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the partonic cascade terminates at virtuality @xmath32 as seen from the arguments of the multiplicities in the integrals . with limits of 0 and 1 , the cascade extends into the nonperturbative region with virtualities smaller than @xmath33 , i.e.  @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where the very notion of partons becomes scarcely applicable .",
    "this region contributes terms of the order of @xmath29 , power - suppressed in energy .",
    "it is not clear whether the equations and the lphd hypothesis are valid down to the cutoff @xmath32 only or if the nonperturbative region can be included as well .",
    "nonetheless , the purely perturbative expansions ( [ gam ] ) and ( [ rat ] ) with constant coefficients @xmath36 and energy - dependent @xmath37 are applicable only in the case of limits 0 and 1 .",

    "the smallness of @xmath45 is a good indication of the convergence of the series at this energy .",
    "note that we have used the traditional method ( see  @xcite ) of considering @xmath5 and @xmath9 to be the main ingredients of the calculation and that we thus employ the conventional definition for the order of the corrections .",

    "it is necessary to differentiate between corrections to @xmath5 ( which we call nlor , etc . ) and those to  @xmath9 .",
    "for example , the nlor - correction given by @xmath47 contributes to @xmath48 only at nnlo and higher orders ( for more details see the next section ) .",

    "a comparison of these results to data is given in section  [ sec - experiment ] .",
    "now we would like to return to the issue of the limits of integration mentioned above .",

    "these are given in the integrals @xmath56 presented in appendix  1 . in particular , using the formulas of appendix  1 for @xmath57 , one obtains rather large contributions from the nonperturbative region : @xmath58 .",
    "however @xmath59 only at the @xmath60-resonance and is much smaller at the @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , narrowing the range of integration reduces the energy dependence . the 3nlo result for @xmath5 based on the narrower range of integration",
    "is shown by the curve labeled @xmath61 in fig .  1 .",
    "surely , it is not entirely satisfactory to replace @xmath29 in the limits of integration by a constant @xmath52 because if @xmath52 depends on @xmath31 the coefficients @xmath38 become energy dependent and their derivatives need to be considered as well .",

    "we have shown how the perturbative series can be used to evaluate @xmath9 and @xmath5 , and where nonperturbative corrections become important . in this section ,",
    "we show that the perturbative approach should work well for the ratio of the slopes of the multiplicities but that it is much less reliable to use low order perturbative estimates , even at the @xmath3-energy , for such quantities as the slope of @xmath5 or the ratio of slopes of logarithms of multiplicities ( we shall call them the logarithmic slopes ) .",

    "the factor in front of the bracket is very small even at present energies : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "nonetheless , the numerical estimate of @xmath62 is unreliable because of the expression in the brackets .",
    "each differentiation leads to a factor @xmath51 ( or @xmath72 ) , i.e.  to terms of higher order . for the values of @xmath47 , @xmath73 , @xmath45 given in table  1 ( @xmath44 ) , one estimates @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( see eq .",

    "the simplest correction , proportional to @xmath76 , is more than twice as large as 1 at present energies , while the next correction , proportional to @xmath77 , is about  0.4 .",

    "we conclude that within the present accuracy of @xmath105 corrections , the perturbative qcd approach fails in the precise determination of the logarithmic slope of the quark jet multiplicity @xmath48 even at the @xmath3 and can be trusted only at much higher energies .",

    "the data are seen to lie substantially below the predictions .",
    "the theoretical results approach the experimental values more closely , however , as higher order terms are included .",
    "the comparatively large value of @xmath73 helps in this regard although it also poses some problems for the perturbative treatment of slopes , as discussed in section  [ sec - slopes ] .",

    "this was done in  @xcite by adding an ad - hoc constant to @xmath18 which was found to be rather large ( about 23 ) .",
    "it seems premature to introduce constant offsets to the quark and gluon jet multiplicities before other , better motivated possibilities are studied both from the theoretical and experimental sides . apart from the ambiguities in the delphi measurements discussed above , there is a rather regular way to account for higher order perturbative and nonperturbative corrections which leads in the proper direction .",
    "this is supported by the computer solution  @xcite of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) with quite satisfactory agreement with experiment for the value of @xmath5 at the @xmath3 .",
    "the slight difference at low energies results in a disagreement on slopes which becomes a stumbling - stone for the whole approach and requires very accurate calculations .",
    "to predict values of the slopes with a precision of several percent one needs computer solutions of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) with the refinements mentioned at the end of section  [ sec - means ] .",
    "at present , analytical estimates provide accuracy on the order of 1020% . by itself , it is astonishing to obtain any agreement at all given the large value of the expansion parameter @xmath71 at hand .",
    "this should be considered as a success of the whole approach .",
    "the predictions about curvatures and widths , as well as higher moments , should also be confronted to experiment ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that purely perturbative qcd estimates of the anomalous dimension @xmath21 and the ratio of average multiplicities in gluon and quark jets @xmath5 are quite reliable at the level of about 10 - 20@xmath6 , where the nonperturbative corrections become important .",
    "the simplest estimates of these corrections arising from the limitation of the parton cascade by some virtuality cut - off are given .",
    "for the slope of @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath143 and for the ratio of the logarithmic slopes of average multiplicities @xmath93 , the perturbative results become reliable only at much larger energies than the @xmath3 .",
    "however , the qualitative trends of the theoretical corrections demonstrate a tendency to yield better agreement with experiment as higher orders are included . in particular , the partial compensation of higher order corrections in the ratio of the slopes of average multiplicities @xmath78 results in a good description of the data by the lowest nlo - expression .",
    "these conclusions are obtained using corrections of order @xmath42 in @xmath21 and @xmath5 as given by the equations for the generating functions . to evaluate the slopes at the @xmath3 and below with better accuracy one should solve the equations numerically .    in the same approximation",
    "we have derived the analytical predictions of perturbative qcd for the curvatures of the average multiplicities of quark and gluon jets as a function of energy ( or of the evolution parameter ) .",
    "recent progress in disentangling quark and gluon jets leads a way to the experimental verification of these predictions .",
