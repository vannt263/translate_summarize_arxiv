    "while the standard model(sm ) is in full agreement with all experimental data@xcite , it is generally believed that new physics must exist at a scale not far beyond the reach of existing accelerators .",
    "associated with this scale may be a host of new and exotic particles .",
    "a new neutral gauge boson , @xmath1 , is the most well - studied of all exotic particles and is the hallmark signature for extensions of the sm gauge group .",
    "current direct searches for the existence of such particles at the tevatron@xcite suggest that their masses must be in excess of 500 - 700 gev depending upon their couplings to the sm fermions and their kinematically accessible decay modes .",
    "if such a particle is found at future colliders the next step will be to ascertain its couplings to all of the conventional fermions . in this way",
    ", we may hope to identify whether this new particle corresponds to any one of the many @xmath1 s proposed in the literature or is something else entirely . at hadron colliders ,",
    "a rather long list of observables has been proposed over the years to probe these couplings  each with its own limitations@xcite .",
    "it has been shown under idealized conditions , at least within the context of @xmath5-inspired models , that the lhc(@xmath6 tev , @xmath7 ) will be able to extract useful information on all of the @xmath1 couplings for @xmath8 below @xmath9 tev .",
    "it is _ not _ clear , however , how much of this program can be carried out using realistic detectors at the lhc@xcite and how well it generalizes to other extended gauge models since detailed simulation studies have yet to be performed .    at the nlc , when @xmath10 ( the most likely scenario for a first generation machine given the tevatron bounds ) a @xmath1 can only manifest itself indirectly as deviations in , , cross sections and asymmetries from their sm expectations",
    "this is analogous to the observation of the sm @xmath11 at pep / petra / tristan energies through deviations from the expectations of qed .",
    "fortunately the list of useful precision measurements that can be performed at the nlc is reasonably long and the expected large beam polarization(@xmath12 ) plays an important role  essentially doubling the number of useful observables . in the past",
    ", analyses of the ability of the nlc to extract @xmath1 coupling information in this situation have taken for granted that the value of @xmath8 is already known from elsewhere , , the lhc@xcite .",
    "( in fact , one might argue that if a 1 tev @xmath1 is discovered at the lhc , a future lepton linear collider designed to sit on this @xmath1 must be built and will thus quite easily determine all of the @xmath1 couplings in analogy to slc and lep . ) here we address the more complex issue of whether it is possible for the nlc to obtain information on couplings of the @xmath1 if the mass were for some reason _ a priori _ unknown . in this case",
    "we would not only want to determine couplings but the @xmath1 mass as well .",
    "we will limit our discussion below to the @xmath13 channel and ignore the additional information available through @xmath14 collisions@xcite .",
    "if the @xmath1 mass were unknown it would appear that the traditional nlc @xmath1 coupling analyses would become problematic .",
    "given a set of data at a fixed value of @xmath2 which shows deviations from the sm , one would not be able to _ simultaneously _ extract the value of @xmath8 as well as the corresponding couplings .",
    "the reason is clear : to leading order in @xmath15 , rescaling all of the couplings and the value of @xmath8 by an overall common factor would leave the observed deviations from the sm invariant . in this approximation",
    ", the @xmath1 exchange appears only as a simple contact interaction .",
    "thus as long as @xmath10 , the only potential solution to this problem lies in obtaining data on deviations from the sm at _ several _ , distinct @xmath2 values and combining them into a single fit .",
    "it is clear from the beginning that all of the set of @xmath2 values chosen for this analysis can not lie too far below the @xmath1 mass otherwise we would always remain in the contact interaction limit .",
    "it must be , for at least one of the @xmath2 choices , that sub - leading terms of relative order @xmath15 are of numerical importance .",
    "this suggests that the maximum value of @xmath2 within this set should only be about a factor of 2 - 3 lower than the @xmath1 mass .    here",
    "we report on the first analysis of this kind , focussing on observables involving only leptons and/or @xmath0-quarks . in performing such an analysis",
    ", we need to know how many @xmath2 values are needed .",
    "we need to know how we distribute the integrated luminosity(@xmath16 ) to optimize the results .",
    "similarly , we must address whether such an analysis can be performed while maintaining model - independence . in this _ initial _ study we begin to address these and some related issues .",
    "it is clear that that there is a lot more to be done before we have the answers to all these questions .",
    "in order to proceed with this benchmark study , we will make a number of simplifying assumptions and parameter choices . these can be modified at a later stage to see how they influence our results .",
    "( the basic analysis follows that discussed in @xcite . ) in this analysis we consider the following ten observables : the total production cross sections for leptons and @xmath0-quarks , @xmath17 , the corresponding forward - backward asymmetries , @xmath18 , the left - right asymmetry obtained from flipping the initial electron beam polarization , @xmath19 , and the polarized forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath20 . for @xmath21 final states",
    ", we include the average @xmath22 polarization , @xmath23 , as well as the forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath22 polarization , @xmath24 .",
    "other inputs and assumptions are summarized as follows :    anomalous trilinear gauge couplings fun = 8.fun and games with extended technicolor models  e,@xmath25,@xmath22 universality isr with @xmath26 +  @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 +  @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32 +  @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 neglect @xmath35-channel exchange in @xmath36    of special note on this list of assumptions are : ( @xmath37 ) a @xmath0-tagging efficiency(@xmath38 ) of @xmath39 for a purity(@xmath40 ) of 100@xmath41 , ( @xmath42 ) the efficiency for identifying all leptons is assumed to be 100@xmath41 , although only @xmath39 of @xmath22 decays are assumed to be polarization analyzed , ( @xmath43 ) a @xmath44 angle cut has been applied to all final state fermions to mimic the anticipated detector acceptance , ( @xmath45 ) a strong energy cut to remove events with an excess of initial state radiation(isr ) has been made  this is critical since events with lower effective values of @xmath2 substantially dilute our sensitivity , ( @xmath46 ) it has been assumed that both the beam polarization(@xmath12 ) and machine luminosity(@xmath16 ) are both well measured . it is important to note that we have _ not _ included the @xmath35-channel contributions to @xmath47 in these calculations .",
    "in addition to the above , final state qed as well as qcd corrections are included , the @xmath0-quark and @xmath22 masses have been neglected , and the possibility of any sizeable @xmath48 mixing has also been neglected ; this is an excellent approximation for the @xmath1 mass range of interest to us given that we are not interested in the @xmath49 mode . since our results will generally be statistics limited , the role played by the systematic uncertainties associated with the parameter choices above will generally be rather minimal , especially in the lepton case .",
    "larger systematics should possibly be associated with the @xmath0-quark final states@xcite but they have been ignored here for simplicity .    to insure model - independence , the values of the @xmath1 couplings , , @xmath50 , as well as @xmath8 ,",
    "are chosen _ randomly _ and _ anonymously _ using a random number generator from rather large ranges representative of a number of extended gauge models .",
    "monte carlo data representing the above observables is then generated for several different values of @xmath2 . at this point ,",
    "the values of the mass and couplings are not ` known ' _ a priori _ , but will later be compared with what is extracted from the monte carlo generated event sample . following this approach",
    "there is no particular relationship between any of the couplings and there is no dependence upon or relationship to any particular @xmath1 model .",
    "( we chose to normalize our couplings so that for the sm @xmath11 , @xmath51 . ) performing this analysis for a wide range of possible mass and coupling choices then shows the power as well as the potential limitations of this technique .    to get an understanding for how this procedure works in general we will make three representative case studies for the @xmath1 mass and couplings , labelled here by i , ii and iii .",
    "there is nothing special about these three choices and several other parameter sets have been analyzed in comparable detail to show that the results that we display below are rather typical . to begin our analysis ,",
    "let us try choosing three distinct @xmath2 values .",
    "specifically , we generate monte carlo ` data ' at @xmath520.5 , 0.75 and 1 tev with associated integrated luminosities of 70 , 100 , and 150 @xmath53 , respectively . these luminosities are only slightly larger than the typical one year values as conventionally quoted@xcite and assumes a reasonable time evolution of the collider s center of mass energy . subsequently , we determine the 5-dimensional @xmath54 cl allowed region for the mass and couplings from a simultaneous fit to all of the leptonic and @xmath0-quark observables following the input assumptions listed above .",
    "this 5-dimensional region is then projected into a series of 2-dimensional plots which we now examine in detail .",
    "1 - 3 show the results of our analysis for these three case studies compared with the expectations of a number of well - known @xmath1 models@xcite . to be specific",
    "we have considered ( _ i _ ) the @xmath5 effective rank-5 model(er5 m ) , which predicts a @xmath1 whose couplings depend on a single parameter @xmath55 ; ( _ ii _ ) the sequential standard model(ssm ) wherein the new @xmath56 and @xmath1 are just heavy versions of the sm particles ( of course , this is not a true model in the strict sense but is commonly used as a guide by experimenters ) ; ( _ iii _ ) the un - unified model(uum ) , based on the group @xmath57 , which has a single free parameter @xmath58 ; ( _ iv _ ) the left - right symmetric model(lrm ) , based on the group @xmath59 , which also has a free parameter ( @xmath60 ) of order unity which is just the ratio of the gauge couplings and , lastly , ( _ v _ ) the alternative left - right model(alrm ) , based on the same extended group as the lrm but now arising from @xmath5 , wherein the fermion assignments are modified in comparison to the lrm due to an ambiguity in how they are embedded in the * 27 * representation .    by examining these figures ,",
    "several things are immediately apparent  the most obvious being that two distinct allowed regions are obtained from the fit in all three cases .",
    "this ambiguity is two - fold and _ not _ four - fold in that there is a unique choice of @xmath0-couplings for a fixed choice of leptonic couplings .",
    "( of course as we might hope , the input values are seen to lie nicely inside one of them . )",
    "this two - fold ambiguity occurs due to our inability to make an absolute determination of the overall sign of _ one _ of the @xmath1 couplings , , @xmath61 .",
    "if the sign of @xmath61 were known , only a single allowed region would appear in figs .  1 - 3 for both leptons and @xmath0-quarks and a unique coupling determination would thus be obtained .",
    "note that this _ same _ sign ambiguity arises in slc / lep data for the sm @xmath11 and is only removed through the examination of low - energy neutrino scattering .",
    "secondly , we see that the leptonic couplings are always somewhat better determined than are those of the @xmath0-quark , which is due to the fact that the leptonic observables involve only leptonic couplings , while those for @xmath0-quarks involve both types .",
    "in addition , there is more statistical power available in the lepton channels due to the assumption of universality and the fact that the leptonic results employ two additional observables related to the final state @xmath22 polarization .",
    "if the @xmath0-quark observables had significant systematic errors , these allowed regions would become larger still .",
    "thirdly , we see in particular from figs .",
    "1a - b and 3a - b the importance in obtaining coupling information for a number of different fermion species .",
    "if only the fig .",
    "1a(3b ) results were available , one might draw the hasty conclusion that an @xmath5-type @xmath1 had been found .",
    "1b(3a ) clearly shows us that this is not the case .",
    "evidently none of the @xmath1 s associated with cases i - iii correspond to _ any _ well - known model .",
    "fourthly , we note that changing the beam polarization from @xmath62 to @xmath63 does not appreciably alter our results .",
    "lastly , as promised , the @xmath1 mass is determined in all three cases , although with somewhat smaller uncertainties in case ii .",
    "it is important for the reader to realize that there is nothing special about any of these three particular cases .",
    "it is clear from this set of random choices for masses and couplings that this procedure should be viable for @xmath1 masses up to about 2 tev for the set of integrated luminosities that we have chosen unless both of the leptonic @xmath1 couplings are accidentally small resulting in a reduced sensitivity to the existence of the @xmath1 .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this analysis to fermion final states other than leptons and the @xmath0-quark .",
    "the extrapolation to charm is the most obvious in that apart from identification efficiencies and potentially larger systematic errors there is little difference in performing the five - dimensional fit with either @xmath0 or @xmath64 since the fermion couplings were randomly chosen .",
    "( of course we might imagine , however , now doing a more ambitious _",
    "seven_-dimensional fit with all of the couplings being allowed to float . )",
    "the extension to @xmath35-quarks would be less straightforward due to their large mass and rapid decay to @xmath65 . in principle , however , the same set of observables could be constructed for top as was used in the @xmath0-quark analysis above .",
    "of course , the clever reader must now be asking the question ` why did we start off using 3 different values of @xmath2  why not 2 or 5 ? '",
    "this is a very important issue which we can only begin to address here .",
    "let us return to the mass and couplings of case i and generate monte carlo ` data ' for only two values of @xmath2=0.5 and 1 tev with luminosities of @xmath16= 100 and 220 @xmath53 , respectively , thus keeping the total @xmath16 the _ same _ as in the discussion above .",
    "repeating our analysis we then arrive at the ` 2-point ' fit as shown in fig .",
    "4a ; unlike fig .",
    "1a , the allowed region in the leptonic coupling plane does not close and extends outward to ever larger values of @xmath66 ; we find that a similar result occurs for the @xmath0-quark couplings which are even more poorly determined .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1 mass contour is also found not to close , again extending outwards to ever larger @xmath8 values .",
    "we realize immediately that this is just what happens when data at only a single @xmath2 is available . for our fixed @xmath16 ,",
    "distributed as we have now done , we see that there is not a sufficient lever arm to simultaneously disentangle the @xmath1 mass and couplings .",
    "of course the reverse situation can also be just as bad .",
    "we now generate monte carlo ` data ' for the case i mass and couplings in 100 gev steps in @xmath2 over the 0.5 to 1 tev interval with the same total @xmath16 as above but now distributed as 30 , 30 , 50 , 50 , 60 , and 100 @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "we then arrive at the ` 6-point ' fit shown in fig .",
    "4b which suffers a problem similar to that presented in fig .",
    "what has happened now is that we have spread the fixed @xmath16 too thinly over too many points for the analysis to work .",
    "these same results are found to hold for all three cases .",
    "this brief study indicates that a proper balance is required to simultaneously achieve the desired statistics as well as an effective lever arm to obtain the @xmath1 mass and couplings .",
    "it is important to remember that we have _ not _ demonstrated that the ` 2-point ' fit will never work .",
    "we note only that it fails with our specific fixed luminosity distribution for the masses and couplings associated with cases i - iii .",
    "it is possible that for ` lucky ' combinations of masses and couplings a 2-point fit will suffice or it may work if substantially more luminosity is achievable .",
    "it is certainly true that all cases where at least three values of @xmath2 are used will allow simultaneous mass and coupling extraction provided the integrated luminosity is available .",
    "clearly , more work is required to further address these issues .",
    "how do these results change if @xmath8 _ were _ known or if our input assumptions were modified ? in this case we use as additional input in our analysis the value of @xmath8 chosen by the monte carlo and perform four - dimensional fits to the same set of ` data ' .",
    "let us return to case i and concentrate on the allowed coupling regions corresponding to a choice of negative values of @xmath67 ; these are expanded to the solid curves shown in figs . 5a and 5c .",
    "( there will also be a corresponding region where @xmath67 are positive , which we ignore for the moment . ) the large dashed curve in fig .",
    "5a corresponds to a reduction of the polarization to @xmath63 with the same relative error as before .",
    "while the allowed region expands the degradation is not severe .",
    "if the @xmath1 mass were known , the ` large ' ellipses shrink to the small ovals in fig .",
    "5a ; these are expanded in fig .",
    "this is clearly a radical reduction in the size of the allowed region .",
    "we see that when the mass is known , varying the polarization or its uncertainty over a reasonable range has very little influence on the resulting size of the allowed regions . from fig .",
    "5c we see that while knowing the @xmath1 mass significantly reduces the size of the allowed region for the @xmath0 couplings , the impact is far less than in the leptonic case for the reasons discussed above .",
    "6a - d show that case i is not special in that similar results are seen to hold as well for cases ii and iii . for both of these cases , as in case",
    "i , there is an enormous reduction in the size of the allowed region for the leptonic couplings of the @xmath1 but the corresponding allowed region for the @xmath0-quark shrinks by about only a factor of two . in case iii",
    ", there is hardly _ any _ reduction in the size of the allowed @xmath0-quark coupling region .",
    "just how large a role does large beam polarization play in obtaining our results ? this becomes a critical issue , especially at higher energies , if our lepton collider is actually a muon collider where we may need to trade off luminosity for high beam polarization@xcite .",
    "as an extreme case , we repeat the previous analysis of cases i - iii without including the observables associated with beam polarization in the fits ; luminosities  remain the same as before .",
    "the results of this approach are shown in figs .",
    "7a - d . in case",
    "i , shown in fig .",
    "7a , the loss of the polarization dependent observables causes the allowed region in the leptonic coupling plane to open up and no closed region is found . correspondingly , the @xmath0-quark couplings to the @xmath1 as well as the @xmath1 mass are constrained but are no longer localized .",
    "somewhat better results are obtained in cases ii and iii , shown in figs . 7b and 7c . for case",
    "ii , the size of the allowed region essentially doubles in the @xmath68 plane and triples in the @xmath69 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath70 constraints are found to relax in a corresponding manner . in case ii , while we are hurt by the lack of polarized beams we are still able to carry out the basic program of coupling extraction and @xmath1 mass determination  unlike case i. in case iii , fig .",
    "7c shows that the leptonic couplings are reasonably constrained without beam polarization but now neither the @xmath1 mass nor the @xmath0-quark couplings were found to be constrained . from these considerations",
    "we may conclude that beam polarization is of critical importance to this analysis unless the couplings lie in a ` lucky ' range .",
    "it is clear that for _ arbitrary _ values , we will not be able to simultaneously obtain mass and coupling determinations without large beam polarization .",
    "we note , however , that this conclusion can soften dramatically if the @xmath1 mass is already known .    what happens for larger @xmath1 masses or when data at larger values of @xmath2 becomes available ?",
    "( as stated above , the ` reach ' in our coupling determinations was @xmath71 tev using the ` data ' at 500 , 750 and 1000 gev . )",
    "let us assume that the ` data ' from the above three center of mass energies is already existent , with the luminosities as given .",
    "we now imagine that the nlc increases its center of mass energy to @xmath2= 1.5 tev and collects an additional 200 @xmath53 of integrated luminosity , which corresponds to 1 - 2 design years . clearly for @xmath1 masses near or below 1.5 tev our problems",
    "are solved since an on - shell @xmath1 can now be produced .",
    "thus we shall concern ourselves only with @xmath1 masses in excess of 2 tev , inaccessible in the lower energy study above . figs .",
    "8a - d show the result of extending our previous procedure  now using 4 different @xmath2 values , for two distinct choices ( iv and v ) of the @xmath1 mass and couplings .",
    "these ` 4-point ' results are a combined fit to the data at all four center of mass energies .",
    "we show the results for both the general case where @xmath8 is unconstrained as well as when it is already determined by other data .",
    "( as before , only one of the allowed pair of ellipses resulting from the overall sign ambiguity is shown for simplicity . )",
    "note that the @xmath1 input masses we have chosen are well in excess of 2 tev where the lhc may provide only very minimal information on the fermion couplings@xcite . clearly by using the additional data from a run at @xmath2=1.5 tev this technique can be extended to perform coupling extraction for @xmath1 masses in excess of 2.5 tev .",
    "the maximum ` reach ' for the type of coupling analysis we have performed is not yet determined .",
    "it seems likely , based on these initial studies , that the extraction of interesting coupling information for @xmath1 masses in excess of 3 tev may be possible for a reasonable range of coupling parameters .",
    "in this paper we have shown that it is possible for the nlc to extract information on the @xmath1 couplings to leptons and @xmath0-quarks even when the @xmath1 mass is not _ a priori _ known and , in fact , determine the @xmath1 mass .",
    "this has been demonstrated in a model - independent manner by randomly and anonymously choosing the mass and couplings of the @xmath1 and demonstrated the power of precision measurements at future linear colliders .",
    "the critical step for the success of the analysis is to combine the data available from measurements performed at several different center of mass energies . for a reasonable distribution of the luminosities the specific results we have obtained suggest , but do not prove , that data sets obtained at at least 3 different energies are necessary for the procedure to be successful .",
    "the mass ` reach ' for this approach is approximately twice the highest center of mass energy available . several question",
    "remain about the optimization of our approach ; these will be addressed in future work .    .25 in",
