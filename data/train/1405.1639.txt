    "euv images of comet lovejoy ( c/2011 w3 ) obtained with the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) instrument on the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) show a tail that consists of a remarkable series of striations a few arcseconds across at an angle to the comet s path .",
    "those striations change direction abruptly along the trajectory , and @xcite showed that they align with the magnetic field based on magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations with the thermodynamic version of the magnetohydrodynamic algorithm on a sphere ( mas ) code .",
    "@xcite showed that the positions , lengths and relative intensities of the tail as seen in the various aia filters agree with the theory that the emission arises from cometary gas as it is ionized through successive ionization states @xcite , with most of the wavelength bands dominated by emission from oxygen . @xcite were able to determine the outgassing rate of the comet and the relative abundances of carbon , oxygen and iron .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the striations further .",
    "we use them to probe the structure of the corona at a single position along the comet s trajectory , rather than relying on a line - of - sight average as is typical of most remote sensing observations .",
    "in particular , we interpret the striations as magnetic flux tubes containing relatively high densities such that neutral h and o atoms from the comet travel with the comet through the low density plasma between the dense tubes .",
    "when they reach a denser region , they become ionized and confined to the flux tube , traveling along it but unable to cross field lines .",
    "the lack of emission between the striations requires that few of the neutrals released from the comet in those regions become ionized in the time it takes the comet to cross , while most of the neutrals released within a striation become ionized .",
    "that implies ionization times , and hence densities , for the high and low density flux tubes .",
    "fine structure in the corona has been seen earlier in processed eclipse images as filaments 10005000 km across @xcite . while the observed contrast level is small , the corona is optically thin and the path length is large , so that november & koutchmy estimated a local density contrast of @xmath0% .",
    "we show that the density contrast we derive is compatible with the eclipse observations . on larger scales ,",
    "polar plumes stand out above the background @xcite , and they have similar density contrasts @xcite .",
    "the small scale density structure has important implications for the propagation and dissipation of alfvn waves .",
    "sharp gradients in alfvn speed cause rapid dispersion and phase mixing , converting the waves to shorter wavelength modes that can damp rapidly @xcite .",
    "density gradients can also give rise to entirely different modes such as drift waves , especially if velocity shear is present , and they might play a role in coronal heating @xcite . if the solar wind mass flux remains roughly constant across the striations , then regions of high ( low ) density will be correlated with regions of low ( high ) radial velocity . in such highly sheared regions , it has been shown that some fraction of an incoming alfvn wave train can be transformed into a compressive , longitudinal form similar to a fast - mode mhd wave ( e.g. , @xcite )    we compare the observed scale of the striations with predictions for the energy - containing scales ( the scales of the waves that contain most of the power and cascade to smaller scales to deposit their energy ) , which are central to models of coronal heating @xcite .",
    "while we concentrate on an open field region of slow solar wind , we also consider a closed field region .",
    "an important aspect of the interaction of the oxygen ions with the magnetic field is that they behave as pickup ions @xcite .",
    "we use the velocity of the comet and the direction of the magnetic field from the mhd model of @xcite to calculate the velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field . to compute the speed of the cometary plasma along the field direction and its rate of spreading , we assume that the particles relax to a bispherical distribution according to the theory of @xcite .",
    "we then compare those predictions with the observations .    in the following sections",
    ", we briefly summarize the properties of comet lovejoy , discuss the aia observations and analyze their implications for the coronal density structure , calculate the predicted velocity and velocity spread along the magnetic field , discuss the implications for mhd wave propagation and summarize our findings .",
    "comet lovejoy is the largest member of the kreutz family of sungrazing comets @xcite seen in several decades .",
    "it reached perihelion at about 1.2 on 16 dec .",
    "2011 and survived for 1.6 days afterwards before the nucleus disintegrated .",
    "the disruption was probably due to thermal stresses in the comet interior @xcite .",
    "the diameter of the nucleus was estimated to be around 600 m before it approached the sun @xcite .    at heliocentric distances above about 3",
    ", comet lovejoy displayed a bright dust tail , but at smaller distances the dust grains sublimate quite rapidly and the dust tail disappeared @xcite .",
    "however , a different tail visible in the uv and euv channels of the aia instrument was seen close to the sun . as described by @xcite ,",
    "most of the aia wavelength bands contain some lines of ionized oxygen along with the lines of highly ionized iron they were designed to capture .",
    "as the oxygen produced by photodissociation of water from the comet proceeds through the successive ionization stages , it emits photons in those bands .",
    "@xcite showed that at coronal temperatures , each oxygen ion emits a fixed number of photons in each aia band before it is ionized , so that it is simple to compute the number of o atoms released per second from the brightness in the aia images .",
    "the aia 1600  band is dominated by c  iv rather than any o ion , and some emission from fe in the aia 171  band was indicated by comparison with the 131  and 193  bands , which are dominated by emission from the same o ions present in the 171  band ( o v and o vi ) .",
    "it was possible to match the relative count rates in the different bands to within about a factor of 2 , derive the relative abundances of c , o and fe , and determine the outgassing rate . at the time of peak brightness , at about 00:46 ut , @xcite derived an outgassing rate of about @xmath1 oxygen atoms per second , for a mass loss rate of about @xmath2 g / s .",
    "the aia observations are presented in @xcite and @xcite . a set of images",
    "was obtained every 12 seconds with 0.6@xmath3@xmath3 pixels for a spatial resolution of 1.5@xmath3@xmath3 @xcite . for the analysis here ,",
    "we confine ourselves to the 171  band .",
    "the striations can be seen most clearly in that band because of its large effective area and the strong o v , o vi and fe ix lines in the bandpass .",
    "in addition , the ionization times of those ions are longer than the ionization times of the lower ions that dominate the other wavelength bands , so the striations are longer in the 171  band .",
    "we analyze images obtained near 00:46 ut , when the comet was about 1.3 from sun center .    figure  [ mccauley ] , which reproduces part of figure 3 of @xcite , is a superposition of three images in the aia 171  band at intervals of 36 seconds .",
    "it clearly shows how the emission in each individual striation moves along the magnetic field and spreads along the field with time . in order to estimate the densities inside and outside of the striations",
    ", we will use the intensity contrast . in order to study the pickup ion behavior of the oxygen ions",
    ", we will use the speed along the magnetic field and the rate of spreading .",
    "figure  [ images ] shows the sum of 26 2-sec exposures obtained over 312 seconds , beginning at 00:44:24 ut during comet egress .",
    "since the ionized plasma from the comet moves along magnetic field lines , the striations show the field line structure . the curvature seen in some of the striations",
    "could be partly due to intrinsic curvature of the field lines , but it may be largely due to relaxation of the field lines after they are perturbed by the ram pressure of the cometary gas .",
    "figure  [ intensity ] shows images of the comet in the right panels and corresponding plots of the intensities along the lines cutting across the striations in the left panels .",
    "the top row shows the intensities for an image during ingress while the lower two rows show the intensities for two times during egress .",
    "the intensity contrast is a factor of 2 to 3 and the separation between striations is about 5@xmath3@xmath3 , or 4000 km , in the egress images . that contrast may be something of an underestimate due to the instrumental resolution of 1.5@xmath3@xmath3 , so the factor of 2 to 3 is a lower limit .",
    "the filling factor of the striations is about 1/2 , but that may also be influenced by the instrumental resolution .",
    "the amplitude of the brightness fluctuations in the ingress image is similar , but the separations are larger and less regular .",
    "the analysis in the following sections will concentrate on the egress observations , but we will return briefly to the ingress observation below .    the top panel in figure  [ width ] shows the extent of the brightest striation ( indicated by the arrows in figure  [ intensity ] ) along its axis at each time .",
    "the values shown are fwhm widths of the brightness distribution along the filament .",
    "the width grows with time due to the spread of the ion velocities along the magnetic field . at later times the width saturates as",
    "the emission becomes very faint .",
    "the slope of the width vs. time plot is 0.224@xmath3@xmath3/second , or 159 km / s in the plane of the sky .",
    "the lower panel shows the centroid position of the emission .",
    "the slope gives the plane - of - sky projection of the velocity along the magnetic field .",
    "the value of 0.216@xmath3@xmath3/sec corresponds to 154 km / s . from the magnetic field vector and the line - of - sight direction @xcite",
    ", we find that the measured ( projected ) values are 0.82 times the actual deprojected values .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 and the emitting region spreads at 200 .",
    "we have chosen the observations during egress at about 00:44.5 ut for detailed analysis . according to the mas models ,",
    "this is an open field region where the coronal plasma flows at 43 .",
    "that speed indicates that this is a slow solar wind region .",
    "the striations are clearly aligned with the local magnetic field @xcite .",
    "they are quasi - periodic , which might suggest a periodic source from the comet , and figure 7 of @xcite shows that the outgassing rate varies with time .",
    "however , the comet travels from one striation to the next in about 9 seconds , and it is not plausible that the comet rotates that rapidly .",
    "nine seconds is much less than the critical rotation period for disruption of around half an hour @xcite and much less than observed comet rotation periods of hours to days . instead ,",
    "the striations arise because neutrals are not tied to the magnetic field , while ions are .",
    "the comet produces water at a rate of @xmath1 molecules per second near the brightness peak at 00:49 ut @xcite .",
    "photodissociation quickly splits the molecules into h and o atoms which share the comet s motion and form a cloud that expands at a few @xcite as it travels at 530 through the corona .",
    "the atoms travel freely until they become ionized and trapped on a field line .",
    "we can obtain an upper limit to the density between striations from the intensity contrast and the condition that few of the cometary atoms are ionized in the inter - striation plasma .",
    "the comet crosses one of these 4@xmath3@xmath3 regions in about 5 seconds .",
    "the ionization rate coefficients of h and o atoms are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , at temperatures of 1.5 to 2 mk according to the rates of @xcite as given by version 7.1 of chianti @xcite .",
    "ionization can also occur by way of charge transfer with protons in the corona . for h and o atoms",
    "the rate coefficients @xmath7 are @xmath8 and @xmath9 for a speed of 530 based on cross sections of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus the total ionization rate coefficients for both h and o are about @xmath10 .",
    "the condition that fewer than 30% of the atoms are ionized between striations ( @xmath11 ) translates into an upper limit of @xmath12 on the coronal density between the striations .    on the other hand ,",
    "most of the atoms are ionized in the striations . in order for 90% of the atoms from the comet to become ionized within a striation",
    ", the crossing time has to be at least twice the ionization time , @xmath13 .",
    "that implies a density of at least @xmath14 within the striations .",
    "thus the density contrast must be at least a factor of 6 .",
    "we note that if the striations occupy about half the space surrounding the comet and have densities near this limit , the average density is around @xmath15 .",
    "the mas model predicts a density of @xmath16 at the point along the comet s path corresponding to the aia image at 00:45:36 ut , but we will argue below that the the magnetic field direction in is better agreement with the position which the comet reached 23 minutes earlier , and the predicted density there is @xmath17 , in reasonable agreement with our estimated average density .",
    "this shift of 2 or 3 minutes corresponds to an offset of about 4 degrees in solar longitude , which is quite reasonable given the uncertainty in the magnetic field at the solar surface used by the mas model .",
    "another estimate of the density in the striations can be obtained from the emission measure ( @xmath18 ) , the filling factor ( @xmath19 ) , and an estimate of the length scale through the corona ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite obtained an emission measure from the aia images just outside the comet s tail of @xmath22 .",
    "the filling factor appears to be about 0.5 based on the fraction of the tail included in the striations , and the length scale is roughly 0.6 .",
    "thus we estimate @xmath23 .",
    "this is clearly an average for the high density regions along the line of sight .",
    "since the comet was not too far from the plane of the sky at that time , it may be a reasonable estimate , but the observations pertain to an open field region , and closed field loops along the line of sight could easily dominate the emission measure .",
    "therefore , we take this to be an upper limit .",
    "this limit agrees well with the estimate of @xmath24 derived from the ionization time from o iii to o vi by @xcite .",
    "the density derived from the ionization time includes the electrons liberated by ionizing hydrogen and oxygen from the comet , so we conclude that @xmath24 is a solid upper limit to the density in the striations before the comet s arrival , while a density of @xmath14 from the density contrast is a lower limit .    the real situation is complex , of course .",
    "the density of cometary atoms is large enough that , once they begin to ionize , they significantly increase the total density .",
    "however , the ions and electrons move away from the cloud of neutrals at over 150 .",
    "another complication is the uncertainty in the electron temperature .",
    "ionization by electrons continues as long as the electrons remain hot .",
    "each ionization requires the ionization potential of 13.6 ev , and roughly 16 ev is lost in photons produced by collisional excitation .",
    "moreover , the total thermal energy is shared among an increased number of electrons , rapidly reducing the temperature , so that each coronal electron can ionize only 3 or 4 cometary atoms unless additional heat is supplied .",
    "there is plenty of energy available in the cometary ions , so it is likely that the electron temperature is maintained by coulomb collisions with ions .",
    "a detailed calculation is beyond the scope of this paper , but an electron temperature of 12 mk is consistent with the ionization times inferred from the relative intensities in the different aia bands and with the x - rays detected with the xrt instrument on _ hinode _ @xcite .      the cause of the inhomogeneous coronal density structure is not yet clear .",
    "one possibility is that the variations in density originate at the footpoints of magnetic flux tubes and propagate upward .",
    "intensity oscillations measured with off - limb euv imaging and spectroscopy imply the presence of compressible mhd waves that appear channeled along polar plumes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these fluctuations have periods of order 1020 minutes , and if they were slow - mode mhd waves ( @xmath25 km s@xmath26 ) , they could have wavelengths of order 0.20.4 @xmath27 .",
    "these temporal and spatial scales are larger than the resolved passage through the striations , so the comet would be expected to `` sample '' such oscillations as quasi - static structures . the measured off - limb density fluctuation ratio @xmath28 is only of order 0.030.1 , but line - of - sight integration effects are likely to wash out the true local fluctuation amplitude .",
    "another type of proposed upflowing density variation is the jet- or piston - like motion associated with type ii spicules .",
    "these features have been suggested as a major source of mass for the corona and solar wind @xcite , though @xcite argues that these upflows are probably a minor contributor .",
    "a related possibility is that mass is injected into specific flux tubes in the slow solar wind by reconnection of open and closed magnetic fields in the low corona @xcite .",
    "that model was advanced specifically for the slow solar wind , but we see similar striations in fast wind regions , such as just before the kink in the upper panel of figure 3 .",
    "reconnection between open and closed magnetic flux also occurs in coronal holes , but one might expect different scales lengths and filling factors .",
    "neither of the above impulsive - driving scenarios makes a clear prediction as to the size or filling factor of the high and low density regions .",
    "still another picture is that variations in the expansion factor of different flux tubes give rise to different rates of alfvn wave reflection , turbulent cascade , and coronal heating .",
    "this in turn causes differences in the flow speeds and densities in neighboring flux tubes .",
    "@xcite found significant inter - tube variations in a model containing a dense grid of flux tubes that connected a high - resolution quiet - sun magnetogram with the ecliptic plane .",
    "the model solved time - steady equations of mass , momentum , and energy conservation along each flux tube using a self - consistent description of non - wkb alfvn wave reflection and turbulent heating .",
    "each of the individual flux tube models was given identical lower boundary conditions at the photosphere , and they differed only in the radial dependence of magnetic field strength .",
    "figure  [ densmodel ] shows a cut through the modeled set of flux tubes at a constant radius of @xmath29 . at that height ,",
    "the mean separation between neighboring flux tubes was 5100 km , and roughly 45% of the flux tubes exhibited nearest - neighbor separations less than the observed striation size of 4000 km .",
    "the minimum , mean , and maximum electron densities in this set of models were @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean density was 0.32 , which implies a representative contrast factor of order 3 .",
    "the distribution of transverse scale sizes is roughly a power law , with no dominant scale that separates the densest flux tubes from their more rarefied surroundings .",
    "it is also within the realm of possibility that a sort of filamentation instability operates , based perhaps on the focusing of alfvn waves into the lower alfvn speed regions corresponding to higher density flux tubes . in quasi - steady flow models such as those of @xcite , enhanced heating below the critical point in those flux tubes",
    "would further increase the density in those flux tubes .",
    "nevertheless , it does appear to be possible that the observed striations could be the result ( at least in part ) of natural variations in the time - steady coronal heating and wind acceleration .",
    "in other words , it is not surprising that a highly structured magnetic field gives rise to a highly structured coronal plasma .",
    "the cloud of neutral hydrogen and oxygen atoms produced by photodissociation of water moves with the comet and expands at a few .",
    "when the atoms become ionized as they travel through the coronal magnetic field they behave as pickup ions @xcite .",
    "initially they have velocity components @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the angle between the comet s trajectory and the magnetic field .    since @xmath37 is the same for all the newly formed ions , they form a ring distribution in velocity space .",
    "the ring distribution is unstable , and it evolves into a bispherical shell in velocity space by emitting and absorbing alfvn waves on a time scale of a few gyroperiods @xcite .",
    "the bispherical shell is described in detail by williams & zank , and in particular the energy of the bispherical distribution is given by their equation 4 as @xmath38\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , the areas of the sections of the bispherical shell are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and of course @xmath42 is the alfvn speed . under the assumption that the ions uniformly cover the bispherical shell , equation 3 of @xcite",
    "gives the bulk speed along the magnetic field .    to compare the predicted pickup ion behavior with observations",
    ", we use the mas model predictions for the magnetic field direction and the alfvn speed . that provides the parameters for the bispherical distribution and for the projection of the velocities onto the plane of the sky .",
    "we consider the position corresponding to the observation at 00:44.5 ut shown in figures 1 through 5 , where the comet was moving at 527 , and where the high outgassing rate provided us with the best data .",
    "the mas model magnetic field at the 00:44.5 ut position lies only 3@xmath43 from the direction perpendicular to the comet s motion , so that the predicted speed along the striation is only 24 .",
    "however , the predicted direction of the field is changing rapidly in that region .",
    "in addition , the position of that rapid change is somewhat uncertain as a result of the uncertainty in the solar surface magnetic field that serves as a boundary condition , especially because the relevant region lies just behind the solar limb , and no magnetic field measurements exist for the back side of the sun . therefore , we also consider the coronal field predicted for a region that the comet passed 2.5 minutes earlier , at 00:41.9 ut . at that position",
    "the angle between the comet s orbit and the field was larger so that the predicted @xmath44 , while still lower than the observed value , is much more reasonable .",
    "table 1 lists the velocity components of the comet s motion and the components of the magnetic field in the carrington coordinate system , along with the density and aflvn speed , as predicted by the mas model .",
    "it also compares the observed and predicted values of the bulk velocity and expansion velocity along the field in the plane of the sky ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ) and the total kinetic energy ( after deprojecting the plane - of - the - sky velocities ) with the predicted energy of the bispherical distribution ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ) .",
    "* table 1 *    model and observed parameters    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     times in seconds",
    "we find that neighboring flux tubes show density variations of at least a factor of 6 on a scale of few thousand km in an open field region at a height of about 1.3 .",
    "while we have done a detailed analysis at only one position , similar striations are seen all along along the comet s path . from figure 1 of @xcite , there is an indication of wider separations at larger heliocentric heights .",
    "earlier in the egress , when the comet was at a lower height , the tail was narrower and more continuous , presumably as a result of higher density in that region .",
    "the structure resembles that inferred from an edge - enhanced white light eclipse image by @xcite , who also inferred a substantial density contrast .",
    "it is unclear to what extent the small - scale striations elucidated in this paper relate to the larger - scale _ polar plumes _ that have been long known to exist in coronal holes .",
    "plumes are bright ray - like features that trace out open magnetic field lines and exhibit a strong intensity contrast in off - limb images ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observational attempts to measure the density contrast between plumes and the more tenuous interplume corona have yielded different answers depending on the exact diagnostic techniques used . at heliocentric",
    "radii around 1.11.3 @xmath27 , several analyses of the line - of - sight euv and white - light emission have given density contrast ratios of order 36 ( e.g. , saito 1965 ; young et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , at similar heights , orrall et al .",
    "( 1990 ) combined the euv and white - light data to estimate a statistical irregularity ratio @xmath49 .",
    "they inferred the presence of substantially higher contrast ratios of order 2060 .",
    "orrall et al .   concluded that there must be density fluctuations on spatial scales below their resolution of 560 .",
    "the inferred density contrast between flux tubes indicates variations in the alfvn speed of at least factors of 23 .",
    "this points to the likelihood that large - scale mhd fluctuations will undergo rapid dispersion in the interface regions as they propagate along the field . when mhd waves pass through a strongly inhomogeneous background medium , their properties",
    "can be altered in a number of ways .",
    "our understanding of these transformations has been shaped by concepts from linear theory such as reflection @xcite , refraction @xcite , and mode coupling @xcite .",
    "further suggestions for the transformation and dissipation of wave energy  including phase mixing , shear - driven couplings , and various instabilities  were summarized in section 1 .",
    "it may also be the case that these kinds of mode conversions may be responsible for producing low - frequency compressive waves in coronal holes as observed recently by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , since such waves are unlikely to travel far into the corona if they are produced only at the solar surface @xcite .",
    "the spatial scale of the cross - field striations revealed by comet lovejoy was roughly 4000 km at a heliocentric radius of @xmath501.3 @xmath27 .",
    "this demonstrates the presence of magnetic flux tubes with diameters at least an order of magnitude smaller than would exist if supergranular `` funnels '' were the smallest building blocks of coronal structure ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed spatial scale of 4000 km falls within the range of predictions of the perpendicular correlation length , or energy - containing length , in recent models of mhd turbulence . in these models ,",
    "the turbulence is driven by the random - walk motions of kilogauss - field intergranular bright points on the solar surface .",
    "those bright points have horizontal scales of order 50200 km in the photosphere @xcite . in the open flux tube models of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the correlation length @xmath51 expands as the background field strength @xmath52 decreases , with @xmath53 . at heights of 1.21.4 @xmath27 , the @xcite model gave @xmath546700 km , and the @xcite model gave @xmath551700 km .",
    "more recently , @xcite updated this model to include nonlinear effects that come to dominate in interplanetary space , and at 1.21.4 @xmath27 , the revised values of @xmath51 were found to be 28004300 km . @xcite showed that this range of correlation lengths is consistent with faraday rotation fluctuations measured via radio sounding of spacecraft signals through the inner corona .",
    "the existence of density fluctuations on similar length scales is a predicted feature in both `` passive scalar '' extensions of mhd turbulence theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) and three - dimensional wave - driven models of the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the images also allow us to test the theory of pickup ions .",
    "we measure a speed along the magnetic field of 154 and a rate of spreading of 159 in the plane of the sky .",
    "after correction for projection effects , the parallel speed is higher than expected from the comet velocity and the magnetic field direction . on the other hand ,",
    "when those numbers and the alfvn speed predicted by the mas mhd model of @xcite are put into the @xcite pickup ion model , the rate of spreading along the field line is below the predicted expansion rate .",
    "the total kinetic energy of the oxygen ions in the bispherical distribution is predicted to be about 60% of the initial oxygen atom kinetic energy , while 40% goes into waves .",
    "the observed kinetic energy is about 2/3 the expected value , quite likely because coulomb equilibration with the protons from cometary @xmath56 has taken some energy from the oxygen .",
    "that will not affect @xmath57 , but it will affect the rate of spreading along the magnetic field .",
    "the mas model predictions are in overall good agreement with the magnetic field directions and densities inferred from the comet images , as reproted by @xcite , provided that shifts along the comet s path corresponding to a few degrees in solar longitude are permitted . considering that the models are based on a surface magnetic field that is measured over the course of a carrington rotation and that the heating model currently used has substantial uncertainty , this is quite good agreement .",
    "a detailed calculation of the electron temperature is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "one complication is that the alfvn speed changes as cometary gas is loaded onto the field lines , and another is that both cooling by excitation and ionization of the o ions and coulomb heating are likely to be important . the coulomb heating increases with charge state .",
    "when the oxygen is singly ionized , the collision time is 200/@xmath58 seconds , and coulomb collisions could not maintain the electrons at @xmath59 k against adiabatic expansion and radiative losses .",
    "however , the collision time drops as @xmath60 , so that coulomb collisions could probably maintain that temperature in the region where the 171  emission arises .",
    "in addition , some of the wave energy produced during isotropization could heat the electrons @xcite .",

    "<S> . they will drastically affect the propagation and dissipation of alfvn waves , and that should be taken into account in models of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> in each striation , the cometary emission moves along the magnetic field and broadens with time . </S>",
    "<S> the speed and the rate of broadening are related to the parallel and perpendicular components of the velocities of the cometary neutrals when they become ionized . </S>",
    "<S> we use an mhd model of the coronal magnetic field and the theory of pickup ions to compare the measurements with theoretical predictions , in particular with the energy lost to alfvn waves as the cometary ions isotropize . </S>"
