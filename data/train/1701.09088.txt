    "then we identify the critical points @xmath52 in lagrangian space that have undergone shell - crossing at time @xmath194 , where @xmath19 is the time of interest for the analyses .",
    "for each critical point , various quantities needed for perturbative calculations , such as @xmath195 and @xmath196 , are also computed .    1 .",

    "the procedure is the same as described in point ( iv ) above , i.e. only critical points which do not fall in a labeled region are treated , and if it is the case , then their lagrangian interval @xmath209 prevails for applying post - collapse dynamics . for the rest of the unlabeled regions ,",
    "standard zeldovich dynamics is applied and the mapping uses the initial density corresponding , of course , to the highest resolution scale .",
    "note that the approximation of the phase - space density distribution constructed this way is generally discontinuous , because we collect perturbative solutions for the displacement field in phase space coming from different coarse - graining scales without imposing smoothness at the transition between these solutions . in this respect ,",
    "the procedure given above is not entirely consistent and remains to be improved in the future .",
    "nevertheless , the discontinuities only affect the results at small scales and in regions where the projected density is small . indeed , the discontinuities correspond to transitions between tails of the @xmath90 shape representing a halo and a non collapsed region or transitions between tails of two @xmath90 shapes in the case of a merger .",
    "as illustrated below through numerical examples , these regions of phase space have small density contrast and thus contribute weakly to second- or higher - order statistics , hence to the power spectrum which is the statistics under focus in this work . with an appropriate choice of @xmath210",
    ", we shall show that the adaptive smoothing procedure provides a substantial improvement on the post - collapse prediction for the overall phase - space structure of the system and the power spectrum of the projected density .",

    "the results would look even worse in the case @xmath295 that we simulated but do not show here . to explain this , one can just take the example of the single @xmath296 mode system , e.g. initial conditions with a single sine wave as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath293 basically makes us approaching the single mode case with @xmath298 , since we always introduce a cut - off at some value @xmath202 to have a sufficiently smooth representation of the phase - space sheet at very small scales .",
    "of course , this situation is unrealistic in practice , because no such problem occurs when considering cdm - like power spectra , but one has to stay aware of the fact that adaptive smoothing does not always work .",
    "a possible way to improve it could consist in changing the filtering window so that all the wavenumbers are affected by the softening procedure , even if it is performed predominantly at a given scale : to this respect , adaptive smoothing with a gaussian window might represent an interesting alternative to our sharp-@xmath186 filter .",

    "[ fig : pk_snap_cdm_midres ] .",
    "note that what @xcite and @xcite call `` stable clustering '' is very specific . in the 1d case considered here ,",

    "this of course supposes that statistical averaging over many halos of different masses does not affect the slope of the power spectrum predicted by the single halo .",

    "such a cut - off enforces some level of smoothness of the curve representing the system in phase space and thus actually imposes the existence of well - defined caustic structures in the nonlinear regime , hence a plateau for @xmath317 at very large @xmath186 , even for the simulations .",
    "however this plateau is not visible in the simulations , because it lies outside the range of @xmath186 shown in the figures . on the other hand",
    ", there must be , according to our `` halo model '' prescription , a regime where @xmath317 might decrease ( @xmath308 ) or present another plateau ( @xmath320 ) or at least some kind of inflection at some intermediate values of @xmath186 .",

    "interestingly , when the inflection is visible , its extension in @xmath186 space is correctly predicted by basic post - collapse pt with adaptive smoothing .",
    "this just shows that basic post - collapse pt is able to predict approximately the correct size for the halos , which we already knew .",
    "note that here , we did not try to position our single halo term discussion in the context of stable clustering predictions .",

    "they are also expected to be valid only in a finite range of values of @xmath186 if one assumes a cut - off at @xmath202 : what we mean here is that our `` one - halo term '' discussion is in fact not incompatible with the concept of stable clustering although the link between the halo model and the stable clustering predictions remain to be performed in details in the present case . clearly , however , the small inflection discussed above marks a small deviation from stable clustering .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a lagrangian perturbation theory method for solving , beyond crossing time , vlasov - poisson equations in the expanding universe for initially cold systems in the infinite parallel planes geometric set up .",
    "the proposed approach captures post - collapse dynamics by computing at leading - order a counter term to the zeldovich solution just after first crossing time .",
    "it extends earlier work of @xcite to the cosmological case and , thanks to adaptive smoothing , to random initial conditions instead of a single halo . by performing a local taylor expansion of the velocity and position of each mass element as functions of lagrangian",
    "coordinate around each initial density peak , we are able to compute the force field in the multi - valued region . a correction to the single - stream flow motion , described by the zeldovich solution , is systematically obtained .",
    "the results are given as polynomial functions of lagrangian position and the coefficient of each power is expressed in terms of quantities associated to density peaks .",
    "a simple analysis of the formation of a single cluster shows that post - collapse pt reproduces well the phase - space structure up to next - crossing time and can describe the projected density profile quite well even at later time .    to deal with the bulk properties of phase - space structures , we propose an adaptive filtering scheme",
    "the idea is very close to the peak - patch treatment by @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the local smoothing scale of initial conditions is determined by the calculation of a dynamical time , but in post - collapse pt this dynamical time is given by next - crossing time instead of collapse time .",
    "this allows us to produce a realistic coarse - grained version of the phase - space structure , even in the presence of mergers . after demonstrating that adaptive smoothing indeed works well in a simple setup with coalescing clusters",
    ", we applied it to more general , random initial conditions that include cdm - like as well as scale - free power spectra .",
    "the results of our analyses show that post - collapse pt predictions with adaptive smoothing reproduce the power spectrum of our numerical simulations remarkably well even at scales sufficiently nonlinear to probe the beginning of the stable clustering regime .    on important thing",
    "to keep in mind for further work is that the critical quantity in post - collapse pt is the time of next crossing , which can in fact be used to also create a spectacularly good pure zeldovich prescription with adaptive smoothing .",
    "while the calculations of post - collapse pt can be cumbersome , the expression ( [ eq : tau_cross ] ) of this time is relatively simple and this can be very interesting when trying to generalize results of post - collapse pt to the three - dimensional case . when analyzing equation ( [ eq : tau_cross ] ) , one indeed notes that @xmath198 depends both on collapse time @xmath53 and on the height @xmath323 of the initial density peak . since @xmath53 depends solely on @xmath323 , we can see that basically the dynamical time we consider for defining the local smoothing scale is a single function of @xmath323 , larger than @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , things are very simple : when performing adaptive smoothing one enforces @xmath324 to be equal to present time , or in other words , adaptive smoothing of initial conditions is performed so that the local peak height given by linear theory at present time , @xmath323 , is a number larger than unity ( instead of exactly unity for the collapse time ) . for instance , in the einstein - de sitter case , @xmath325 and @xmath237 , we have @xmath326 with @xmath210 chosen in this article to be equal to unity for post - collapse pt and one - half for the zeldovich solution .",
    "note that the optimal value of @xmath210 is smaller than these intuitive choices ( see appendix [ sec : choice_of_f_cross ] ) .",
    "the present post - collapse pt treatment together with the adaptive smoothing scheme seems a very promising tool .",
    "a successful extension to the 3d case should lead to a major breakthrough in the precision pt calculations of large - scale structure statistics beyond the single - stream approximation .",
    "our 1d study is however only a first step . toward a practical application to the 3d case",
    ", there are several issues to be addressed .",
    "one is the analytic calculation of statistical quantities such as the power spectrum .",
    "indeed , in the present work , we measured directly the power spectrum from a particle distribution following the dynamics prescribed by the various pt prescriptions under scrutiny .",
    "in fact , analytic calculations of the power spectrum are tractable , at least in the presence of fixed smoothing .",
    "adaptive smoothing itself can in principle be implemented in the analytic framework by inspiring for instance from the theory of excursion sets discussed in e.g. @xcite , although we can foresee that actual calculations will probably be very cumbersome .",
    "another issue , when generalizing to the 3d case , is that the zeldovich solution no longer provides a sufficiently accurate description of the dynamics before collapse .",
    "at least third - order lagrangian pt is required to estimate correctly collapse times as well as the power spectrum beyond tree - level approximation , which clearly adds some significant level of complexity .",
    "furthermore , the variety and complexity of topological configurations of singularities appearing in the 3d case might in fact represent a nearly impassable obstacle in three dimensions ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we will tackle these issues in future work .    finally ,",
    "while we have focused in this article on the impact of post - collapse dynamics in 1d on the phase - space structure and on the power spectrum of the matter distribution , it would be interesting to see quantitatively how the small - scale modes responsible for the multi - stream flows couple to large - scale fluctuations described by the single - stream flows .",
    "this can be presumably clarified by measuring the response of the evolved power spectrum to a small initial perturbation of high-@xmath186 modes , through the comparison between a pair of particle distributions modeled with post - collapse pt that slightly differ in their initial conditions @xcite . in the 3d case",
