    "since the seminal paper by bender and boettcher @xcite much progress has been achieved formulating a consistent quantum theory in which the requirement of hermiticity is replaced by the weaker requirement of @xmath0 symmetry @xcite or pseudo - hermiticity @xcite .",
    "in addition complex @xmath0-symmetric potentials are used for an effective description of quantum systems in contact with an environment .",
    "positive imaginary parts describe a source for the probability amplitude , negative imaginary contributions lead to a sink . in @xmath0-symmetric",
    "systems features can be observed that are not present in a purely hermitian quantum system .",
    "they exhibit true stationary states in spite of an in- and outflux of the probability amplitude @xcite , the occurrence of exceptional points at which two or more eigenstates coalesce @xcite , complicated stability properties of the stationary states , and a very rich dynamics @xcite .",
    "the first experimental realization of a @xmath0-symmetric system succeeded in optical waveguides @xcite , and theoretical proposals for various further systems exist @xcite .",
    "although the concept of @xmath0 symmetry originates from quantum theory no genuine @xmath0-symmetric quantum system has been realized so far .",
    "this is , however , of great importance since the optical systems can only in special cases correctly model effects of the schrdinger equation .",
    "an experimental realization in a genuine quantum system would provide a solid basis for the theoretically investigated physical effects .",
    "a @xmath0-symmetric quantum system which is potentially experimentally accessible is a bose - einstein condensate in a double - well potential , in which particles are removed from one well and injected into the other . in both the idealized version of a double-@xmath1 potential @xcite and in an spatially extended double well @xcite it was shown that the system supports stationary solutions which are stable with respect to small perturbations .",
    "these investigations were done in the mean - field limit described by the gross - pitaevskii equation , which is known to be accurate in the limit of temperatures well below the critical temperature . the gain and loss",
    "is modeled via an imaginary potential which is interpreted as a coherent in- and outcoupling whose strength is proportional to the amount of particles in the condensate .",
    "the physical reasoning behind this proportionality is the bose stimulation of the incoupling , i.e.  the transition rate is enhanced by a factor of @xmath2 if there are already @xmath3 particles in the final state @xcite .",
    "proposals for the experimental realization of such a complex @xmath0-symmetric potential by embedding the system into a larger hermitian transport structure @xcite or via a coupling approach @xcite were , again , formulated in the mean - field limit . in that limit",
    "all correlations are neglected , and , in addition , the condensate is described as a pure state although for @xmath0-symmetric systems we are especially interested in the coupling to the environment .",
    "however , the only physical process describing a gain or loss for the wave function of a bose - einstein condensate on the microscopic scale can be an addition or removal of single particles .",
    "thus , there should exist a microscopic description .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to demonstrate that this microscopic description can be achieved .",
    "thus , it is possible to show that indeed in- and outcoupling processes for single atoms exist , which are capable of explaining the origin of the complex @xmath0-symmetric potentials in the mean - field limit .    on a microscopic level @xmath0-symmetric bose - einstein condensates",
    "have been previously investigated with a non - hermitian bose - hubbard dimer @xcite . there ,",
    "gain and loss were introduced as complex on - site energy contributions .",
    "however , the mean - field limit of such a system does not lead to the known gross - pitaevskii equation with complex potentials , but instead an adapted equation in which the nonlinear term is divided by the norm squared of the wave function .",
    "while this equation has the same normalized eigenstates as the gross - pitaevskii equation , the dynamical behavior , including the stability properties of the eigenstates , clearly differs @xcite .    a different approach to open quantum systems are master equations in lindblad form @xcite , which are well established to describe phase noise , feeding and depleting of a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that the mean - field limit of a master equation , where the coherent dynamics is described by a bose - hubbard hamiltonian and single - particle losses are introduced by a liouvillian , leads to the gross - pitaevskii equation with an imaginary potential whose strength is given by the rate of the liouvillian @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a master equation describing a bose - einstein condensate on two lattice sites as an open quantum system .",
    "gain on one lattice site and loss on the other lattice site are introduced by two liouvillians .",
    "the strengths of particle gain and loss are balanced such that it resembles the behavior of a discrete @xmath0-symmetric gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we show that the dynamical behavior of this master equation with balanced gain and loss is in excellent agreement with the mean - field limit described by the @xmath0-symmetric gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the characteristic properties of @xmath0-symmetric systems such as the existence of stationary states and the phase shift of the oscillations between the two wells are also found in the many - particle description .",
    "visualizing the dynamics on a bloch sphere allows us to compare the complete dynamics of the master equation with that of the @xmath0-symmetric gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the remainder of this paper is ordered as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : master_equation ] the master equation is introduced and a relation for the loss and gain rate is derived such that it can support @xmath0-symmetric stationary solutions . as shown in sec .  [",

    "the system considered has two discrete lattice sites with loss at site 1 and gain at site 2 described by two liouvillians .",
    "the coherent dynamics is given by the bose - hubbard - hamiltonian @xcite which describes bosonic atoms in the lowest - energy bloch band of an optical lattice , @xmath4 with the bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 acting on lattice site @xmath7 .",
    "the first term describes a hopping of atoms between the two lattice sites and the second term an on - site interaction .",

    "we introduce the macroscopic interaction strength @xmath9 with the initial amount of particles in the system @xmath10 .",

    "it is not clear how the ratio @xmath14 has to be chosen such that balanced gain and loss is achieved .",
    "we will see that the obvious choice @xmath15 is only correct in the limit @xmath16 and a different ratio should be chosen for a finite number of particles .",
    "this can be understood by calculating the expectation value of the particle number @xmath17 for a system consisting of only one lattice site with either particle gain or particle loss with an initial number of particles @xmath18 . for this simple model",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for @xmath17 using the ansatz @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the particle number states and the coefficients @xmath21 are real numbers .    in the case of particle loss",
    "the expectation value of the particle number is given by @xmath22 .",
    "note that this exponential decay with loss rate @xmath23 is exactly the same behavior as one would obtain by introducing an imaginary potential @xmath24 into the gross - pitaevskii equation .    in the second case of particle",

    "@xmath26 this leads to an exponential gain with rate @xmath27 , which again is exactly the same as one would obtain by an imaginary potential @xmath28 in the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "since we want to describe the situation of balanced gain and loss the master equation should support stationary @xmath0-symmetric solutions .",
    "a @xmath0-symmetric state has equal probability of presence at the two lattice sites .",
    "therefore we demand that if half of the particles are at the gain lattice site and half of the particles are at the loss lattice site then , at least for short times , the gain and loss should cancel out each other . expanding the terms @xmath29 and @xmath30 up to the first order in @xmath31 , introducing the total particle number at both lattice sites @xmath32 and demanding @xmath33 leads to the following condition for the gain and loss ratio @xmath34 this shows that @xmath27 has to be chosen slightly smaller than @xmath23 . only in the limit",
    "@xmath16 the two rates have to be chosen equal . in the following discussion gain and loss",
    "is characterized by one parameter @xmath35 and @xmath27 is chosen such that eq .",
    "is fulfilled .",
    "to calculate the mean - field limit of eq .",
    "we follow the procedure described in  @xcite . there , the mean - field limit is derived for a similar system with loss but without gain .",
    "starting point is the single - particle density matrix @xmath36 .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath37 is given by the master equation  , @xmath38 with the covariances @xmath39 and the kronecker delta @xmath40 .",
    "the covariances are neglected in the mean - field limit @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the terms describing gain and loss is the sign and the additional kronecker delta . due to the additional kronecker delta",
    "the differential equation is inhomogeneous which has the effect that there is an influx of particles from the environment even in the case @xmath42 . in the mean - field limit",
    "the kronecker delta is small compared to @xmath37 and can be neglected .    in our specific system",
    "we have only loss at lattice site 1 and gain at site 2 , i.e.  @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "due to eq .   for @xmath41 the two rates are equal , @xmath45 . in a last step",
    "the single particle density matrix is replaced by complex amplitudes @xcite , @xmath46 . with these considerations eq .",
    "yields the discrete non - hermitian gross - pitaevskii equation    @xmath47    [ eq : discrete_gpe ]    with the macroscopic interaction strength @xmath48 defined in eq .  .",
    "this shows that the gain and loss processes introduced by the liouvillians and are in the mean - field limit described by imaginary potentials with negative and positive sign , respectively .",
    "the eqs .",
    "are evidently @xmath0-symmetric since the gain and loss contributions have equal strength .",
    "this system can be considered as a simple model for the more realistic extended double - well potential with gain and loss  @xcite .",
    "in fact the eigenvalue spectrum of the discrete two - mode system and the extended double - well system are in excellent agreement  @xcite .    to discuss the eigenvalue spectrum the time dependence is separated @xmath49 leading to the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath50 can be obtained using an analytic extension  @xcite , @xmath51 the eigenvalue spectrum is shown in fig .",

    "we will refer to these states as the ground and the excited state of the system . in the linear case",
    "@xmath55 the @xmath0-broken solutions emerge from the exceptional point at which the @xmath0-symmetric solutions vanish .",
    "for @xmath56 the @xmath0-broken solutions emerge from the excited state and exist at smaller values of @xmath57 .",
    "if the nonlinearity parameter is strong enough , @xmath58 , the @xmath0-broken solutions exist even at @xmath59 .",
    "the occurrence of symmetry - breaking states in the real potential ( @xmath59 ) is known as macroscopic quantum self - trapping  @xcite .",
    "if we want to compare the results of the @xmath0-symmetric gross - pitaevskii equation and the master equation with balanced gain and loss we have to transform a mean - field state into a many - particle state .",
    "an arbitrary mean - field state of the two - mode system is defined by two complex numbers @xmath60 . in the mean - field approximation",
    "it is assumed that every particle is in the same single - particle state .",
    "thus the corresponding many - particle state is @xmath61 with the single - particle state of the @xmath7th particle @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the states describing one particle at site 1 or 2 , respectively .",
    "expressing @xmath65 in the basis of fock states with total particle number @xmath10 leads to the result @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a fock state with @xmath68 particles at site @xmath69 . using eq .",
    "we can now start to compare results of the @xmath0-symmetric gross - pitaevskii equation and the master equation .",
    "the numerical results of the master equation are obtained using the quantum jump method @xcite where we average over quantum trajectories till the results converge .    as a first step we check",
    "if one of the most fundamental properties of @xmath0-symmetric systems , the fact that it supports stationary solutions , is also present in the master equation with balanced gain and loss .",
    "therefore we use the stationary ground state and excited state of the @xmath0-symmetric discrete gross - pitaevskii equation  , transform the mean - field state into a many - particle state using eq .   and calculate the time evolution of this state with the master equation  . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "this shows that the stationary solutions of the @xmath0-symmetric gross - pitaevskii equation can be transfered to the master equation with balanced gain and loss , and again behave stationary in the sense that the expectation values of the particle number at both lattice sites are constant .",
    "thus this fundamental property of @xmath0-symmetric systems is also present in the master equation .",

    "the dynamics is coherent and thus the total amount of particles in the system stays constant .",
    "the oscillations at the two lattice sites have a phase difference of @xmath83 , thus the maxima and minima coincide .",
    "if gain and loss are introduced into the system the dynamics is no longer coherent and as a result the total amount of particles oscillates .",
    "the oscillation of the total amount of particles becomes stronger for greater values of @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the oscillations at the lattice sites become more and more in phase as @xmath57 increases and the exceptional point at @xmath54 is approached ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mf_spectrum ] ) .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of @xmath0-symmetric systems and has already been discussed for bose - einstein condensates in a spatially extended potential  @xcite , and was experimentally confirmed in optical systems  @xcite .    since the system considered is nonlinear it is possible that for the same system parameters one superposition of the ground state and the excited states shows stable oscillations while another superposition diverges .",

    "again the results of the master equation ( solid lines ) and the gross - pitaevskii equation ( dashed lines ) are in excellent agreement . in ( b )",

    "the bloch vector is always normalized to the expectation value of the particle number .",

    "due to the coupling to the environment the particle number is not conserved and thus the trajectories do not run on the surface of the bloch sphere .",

    "the agreement is again very good , solely the trajectories at large radii are cut off in the many - particle calculations .",

    "<S> we present a quantum master equation describing a bose - einstein condensate with particle loss on one lattice site and particle gain on the other lattice site whose mean - field limit is a non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric gross - pitaevskii equation . it is shown that the characteristic properties of @xmath0-symmetric systems , such as the existence of stationary states and the phase shift of pulses between two lattice sites , are also found in the many - particle system . visualizing the dynamics on a bloch sphere allows us to compare the complete dynamics of the master equation with that of the gross - pitaevskii equation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even for a relatively small number of particles the dynamics are in excellent agreement and the master equation with balanced gain and loss is indeed an appropriate many - particle description of a @xmath0-symmetric bose - einstein condensate . </S>"
