    "in condensed matter physics , the goal of generalizing su(2 ) lattice fermion or spin models to those with high symmetries of su(@xmath1 ) @xcite or sp(@xmath1 ) @xcite , was originally to employ the systematic @xmath2-expansion to handle strong correlation physics , especially in the cases with doping or frustrations . generally speaking ,",

    "symmetry has become a realistic goal ( the number of fermion components due to the hyperfine spin degree of freedom is naturally an even number ) .",
    "it was proposed that the simplest sp(@xmath0 ) and su(@xmath0 ) hubbard models with @xmath3 can be realized in the hyperfine spin-@xmath4 alkali and alkaline - earth atoms @xcite . in these spin-@xmath4 hubbard models , an exact sp(4 )",
    "spin symmetry exists without any fine - tuning of parameters , which is further enlarged to su(4 ) when the interactions do not rely on hyperfine spin .",
    "the alkaline - earth atoms , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath5yb and @xmath6sr , have a closed shell of valence electrons and thus their hyperfine spins are simply nuclear spins .",
    "the interactions between the atoms with different hyperfine spins are insensitive to the nuclear spins , leading to the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry with @xmath0 being the number of fermion components @xcite .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made in the experiment of ultracold alkaline - earth fermions with large hyperfine spins .",
    "the @xmath5yb and @xmath6sr atoms have been cooled down to quantum degenerate temperatures @xcite , revealing the su(6 ) and su(10 ) symmetries respectively .",
    "furthermore , an su(6 ) single - band fermionic hubbard model has also been realized with @xmath5yb atoms in a three - dimensional optical lattice@xcite . beyond single - band case ,",
    "the spin - exchange interactions have recently been observed in the two - orbital su(@xmath7 ) and su(@xmath8 ) fermion system respectively@xcite .",

    "theoretically , the novel symmetries of the multi - component hubbard model can give rise to the novel superfluidity @xcite and exotic quantum magnetism @xcite .    in ultracold atom experiments , achieving low enough temperature regime below the spin superexchange scale has been considered a benchmark for simulating strongly correlated quantum systems . despite numerous efforts by experimentalists , achieving this temperature regime is still out of reach and remains one of the most challenging problems in this field .",
    "so far , ultracold fermions in optical lattices have been cooled down to temperature regime below the hopping energy scale , @xmath9 .",
    "one of the promising schemes for further cooling the system into spin superexchange scale @xmath10 is known as interaction - induced adiabatic cooling@xcite , a cooling scheme by adiabatically increasing interactions .",
    "this cooling scheme utilizes the pomeranchuk effect which was originally proposed in @xmath11he systems .",
    "however , for a two - component hubbard model in conventional lattices , the pomeranchuk effect is weak due to the antiferromagnetic correlations in the su(2 ) mott insulator .",
    "it is still controversial whether the system can be cooled down to spin superexchange temperature by pomeranchuk cooling@xcite . as we show below , the multi - component su(@xmath0 ) hubbard model significantly facilitates the pomeranchuk cooling , cooling the system down to the temperature scale of @xmath12 from an initial temperature that is currently accessible in experiments .",

    "the system enters the solid - like strong mott state at large @xmath21 , where the physics is mostly local - moment - like .",
    "the increase of entropy with @xmath21 means that the liquid - like state is more ordered than the solid - like state , known as the pomeranchuk effect . in this temperature regime",

    "fermions on each site are nearly independent of each other , and thus the entropy per site is proportional to the logarithmic of the spin degeneracy . in the weak mott - insulating state , we could think there is still a reminiscence of fermi surface , which strongly suppresses the entropy contribution .",

    "the pomeranchuk effect does not occur in the low temperature regime ( @xmath85 ) , where thermal fluctuations are not strong enough to suppress af correlations . in this case , the af correlations between adjacent sites lift spin degeneracy and lower the entropy in the strong mott - insulating state .",
