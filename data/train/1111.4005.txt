    "slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars are a pulsator of low frequency modes excited by the @xmath4 mechanism associated with the iron opacity bump at @xmath5k in the interior ( e.g. , dziembowski , moskalik , pamyatnykh 1993 ; gautschy & saio 1993 ) .",

    "although spb stars are not necessarily a rapid rotator , the effects of rotation on the low frequency modes can be significant , particularly for @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the rotation frequency and @xmath10 is the oscillation frequency observed in the co - rotating frame of the stars .    here",
    ", we are interested in theoretically determining the amplitudes of low frequency modes in spb stars , taking account of the effects of rotation on the modes . fully hydrodynamical calculation of radial pulsation has a long history , but that of non - radial pulsation is not always feasible to carry out , since it usually requires a huge amount of numerical resources , particularly for low frequency modes in a rotating star . instead of hydrodynamical calculation , we may apply weakly non - linear theory of oscillation to non - radial pulsation , expecting the amplitudes of oscillation modes are limited by weak non - linear coupling between them . as the simplest case , we may consider non - linear coupling between three modes , whose amplitudes are expected to reach an equilibrium state as a result of parametric instability between one unstable mode and two stable modes ( e.g. , dziembowski 1982 ; kumar & goldreich 1989 ; wu & goldreich 2001 ; see also craik 1985 ) .",
    "for the weakly non - linear theory of oscillation , it is essential to calculate the coupling coefficient between oscillation modes as well as their excitation and damping rates . to calculate the non - linear coupling coefficient between three oscillation modes ,",
    "we employ the formulation by schenk et al ( 2002 ) , who extended the theory to the case of rotating stars .",
    "to compute oscillation modes in a rotating star , we use the method of calculation by townsend ( 2005 ) , who applied the traditional approximation to calculate both adiabatic and non - adiabatic oscillations of the star .",
    "the traditional approximation is quite helpful to largely reduce the computing time spent for calculating a large number of coupling coefficients between various non - radial modes in a rotating star .",
    "we briefly describe the method of solution in  2 , and  3 is for numerical results , and  4 is for conclusions .",
    "adiabatic oscillation in a uniformly rotating star may be governed by the linear differential equation : -^2+i()+()=0 , where @xmath10 is the oscillation frequency in the co - rotating frame , @xmath11 is the displacement vector , @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the angular velocity vector of rotation , and @xmath14 is the differential operation on @xmath11 and its expression as well as its derivation may be found , for example , in schenk et al ( 2002 ) . assuming the time dependence of the perturbations is given by the factor @xmath15 , we may write the displacement vector as ( , t)=e^t()=e^t(^r_r+^_+^ _ ) , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the orthonormal base vectors in spherical polar coordinates @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that the equilibrium of the rotating star is axisymmetric about the rotation axis , and that the dependence of the oscillation modes on the azimuthal angle @xmath20 is given by the factor @xmath21 with @xmath1 being an integer representing the azimuthal wave number .",
    "the oscillation frequency @xmath10 may be given as @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the oscillation frequency observed in an inertial frame . because of the dependence given by @xmath24 , the oscillation mode with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is a prograde ( retrograde ) mode .",

    "as indicated by the existence of vertical sequences of open symbols ( daughter modes ) in the panels ( a ) and ( b ) , there arise some cases in which a stable low radial order @xmath0-mode or @xmath50-mode , which has a very small damping rate @xmath222 , is shared by several parent modes , indicating that one stable daughter mode has different amplitudes depending on the mode triads it belongs to .",
    "this may suggest that the set of daughter modes we use for the computation of @xmath119 is not large enough , or that the three mode non - linear coupling theory is too simplified to be applied to the case where modes having an extremely small damping rate exist in dense frequency spectra of oscillation modes .",
    "using the weakly non - linear theory of oscillation , we have estimated the amplitudes of low @xmath1 @xmath50-modes and @xmath0-modes in a slightly evolved @xmath131 main sequence model , assuming the mode amplitudes are limited by parametric instability between one unstable mode and two stable modes . here , the unstable low frequency modes are assumed destabilized by the @xmath4-mechanism associated with the iron opacity bump , and we have taken account of the effects of rotation on low frequency modes in the traditional approximation . for a given unstable mode ( parent mode a ) , we compute three mode non - linear coupling coefficient @xmath119 for various combinations of two stable modes ( daughter modes b and c ) , and we choose , among the numerous combinations , the one that gives the smallest critical amplitude .",
    "the traditional approximation is employed in order to reduce the amount of computing time necessary to find the optimal combination of daughter modes .",
    "it is important to note that since we can use only a limited set of daughter modes the critical amplitude thus determined for a parent mode should be regarded as an upper limit .",
    "the critical amplitude essentially depends on @xmath172 and @xmath173 if we assume resonant mode coupling satisfying @xmath114 , and the smallest critical amplitude may take place when either @xmath172 or @xmath173 is very large or when both of them are large .",
    "if the damping rate of a parametrically excited daughter mode in a mode triad is less than the growth rate of the parent mode , the equilibrium amplitude of the daughter mode can be larger than the parent mode .",
    "it is therefore likely that parametrically destabilized daughter modes like low radial order @xmath50-modes and @xmath0-modes are among the periodicities observed in a rapidly rotating b star .",
    "the fractional amplitudes @xmath193 of the parent and daughter modes can be of order @xmath245 to @xmath246 for the main sequence model , the magnitudes of which may be consistent with those observed in b type variable stars ( e.g. , huat et al 2009 ; diago et al 2009 ; neiner et al 2009 ; cameron et al 2008 ; balona et al 2011 ) .",
    "we also find that the amplitudes @xmath193 of the parent mode tend to be large for high @xmath78 values , although the visibility of the modes decreases with increasing @xmath78 .",
    "we find that @xmath0-modes significantly affects the amplitude determination of low frequency modes in a rapidly rotating star . since low radial order @xmath0-modes of the model have damping rates @xmath222 as small as or even smaller than @xmath247 , the mode triads giving the smallest critical amplitude for the low frequency parent modes are likely to have a low radial order @xmath0-mode as a member .",
    "when a mode triad has a low radial order @xmath0-mode , the equilibrium amplitude of the parent mode tends to be smaller than those for the mode triads without @xmath0-modes .",
    "we find some cases in which a low radial order @xmath0-mode is shared by several parent modes .",
    "we think the degeneracy of the daughter mode in mode triads is a problem in the weak non - linear coupling theory we use , since the equilibrium amplitude of the daughter mode depends on the parent modes it is coupled to .",
    "this degeneracy might be removed if we use an enlarged set of daughter modes to determine the optimal combination , or this degeneracy may suggest that the three mode coupling theory we use is too simplified to be applied to the problem we are considering , that is , we have to consider higher order non - linear mode coupling to lift the degeneracy . in spite of the problem , the weakly non - linear theory could be useful when we try to compare theoretical mode calculations to observations . generally , the number of observationally detected low frequency modes for spb stars is much smaller than that of theoretically calculated linearly unstable modes ( e.g. , walker et al 2005 , saio et al 2007 ) , and we may use the weakly non - linear theory to decide which linearly unstable modes can have amplitudes large enough to be detected observationally .",
    "we may suggest that , if a low radial order @xmath243 @xmath0-mode , which may be linearly stable , is parametrically excited , the @xmath0-mode can produce very long period variations observed in an inertial frame .",
    "we may attribute very slow pulsations detected in spbe stars ( e.g. , walker et al 2005 , saio et al 2007 ) to low radial order @xmath243 @xmath0-modes , although the amplitudes would not be very high as indicated by figure 6 .",
    "we have carried out an additional calculation to obtain the optimal critical amplitudes @xmath171 for the parent modes by extending the set of daughter modes from @xmath248 to @xmath249 for @xmath206 , and we obtained almost the same result for their amplitudes @xmath193 .",
    "however , it is extremely time consuming to carry out similar calculations for @xmath250 much larger than @xmath251 , and from the numerical results we currently have it would be fair to say we are not able to correctly specify what the most likely degrees of the daughter modes are for the parent modes . to construct a set of daughter modes extended for a very large @xmath250 , asymptotic methods would be useful to represent the eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies for high @xmath78 and high radial order @xmath50-modes and to calculate the coupling coefficient @xmath119 ( e.g. , dziembowski 1982 ) , and we may use an asymptotic treatment by lee & saio ( 1989 ) for low frequency modes in uniformly rotating stars . extending our weakly non - linear analysis to large values of @xmath78 , we can also consider non - linear couplings not only between a parent mode and many pairs of daughter modes having similar frequencies but also between a daughter mode and granddaughter modes with frequencies still lower than that of the daughter mode ( e.g. , kumar & goodman 1996 ) .",
    "the problems of these highly multiple mode couplings could be important for the amplitude determination for both the parent modes and daughter modes , and we may have to include these mechanisms in our analysis to obtain definite answers for the oscillation amplitudes in the stars .",
    "we have assumed uniform rotation in the present analysis .",
    "it is , however , quite likely that differential rotation is a rule in reality in a rotating star , and that even a weak differential rotation would affect the frequency spectrum of the low frequency modes .",
    "we need to understand the property of low frequency modes in a differentially rotating star as well as how a differential rotation law is established in a star .",
    "the problem of differential rotation in a rotating star is quite difficult to find answer and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "since we used the traditional approximation to compute low frequency modes in a rotating star , we could not correctly take account of the effects of linear coupling between the modes associated with different @xmath36s .",
    "as discussed by aprilia et al ( 2011 ) , the linear coupling between low frequency modes tends to preferentially stabilize retrograde @xmath50-modes for rapidly rotating b stars , particularly for those having lower effective temperatures .",
    "it is therefore desirable to use the expansion method ( e.g. , lee & saio 1987 ; lee & baraffe 1995 ) to compute low frequency modes in a rotating star for the weakly non - linear coupling calculation ( as well as for the analysis of the pulsational stability ) , although the calculation using the expansion method would be much more time consuming than that using the traditional approximation to find the optimal combination of daughter modes for a given parent mode . in a b type main sequence star , a @xmath142-gradient zone with a high brunt visl frequency forms above the convective core as it evolves from the zams , and the @xmath142-gradient zone has the effect of enhancing the coupling coefficient @xmath172 compared to the case of the zams model with no @xmath142-gradient zone .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath172 would affect the equilibrium amplitudes @xmath192 of the low frequency modes .",
    "it is therefore important to examine the effects of stellar evolution on the quantities @xmath172 and @xmath192 and hence on the amplitude determination of the low frequency modes in spb stars in the weakly non - linear coupling theory .",
    "the oscillation equations for uniformly rotating stars in the traditional approximation may be given by ( e.g. , lee & saio 1990 ) rdz_1dr=(v_1 - 3)z_1+(_kmc_1|^2-v_1 ) z_2 , rdz_2dr=(c_1|^2+ra)z_1+(1-u - ra)z_2 , where z_1=^r(r)r , z_2=p^(r)g r , and v =- dpdr , u = dm_rdr , ra = ddr-1_1dpdr , @xmath252 @xmath253 , @xmath254 , @xmath255 , and @xmath159 and @xmath140 are the mass and radius of the star , and @xmath160 is the gravitational constant . with appropriate boundary conditions imposed at the centre and surface of the star ,",
    "we solve the above set of differential equations as a boundary - eigenvalue problem for the eigenfrequency @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath256 , @xmath257 , and @xmath258 , the derivatives @xmath259 , @xmath260 , and @xmath261 may be calculated by making use of equations ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) .    using the eigenfunctions @xmath11 ,",
    "the oscillation energy @xmath262 observed in the corotating frame of the star is given by ( lee & saio 1990 ) b=^2_0^r^*r^2dr , and it is interesting to note that for positive @xmath36 ( _ km+)_-1 ^ 1d|_km|^2= _ -1 ^ 1d(|^_km|^2+|^_km|^2 ) .",
    "if we neglect the boundary terms using the pressure zero surface boundary condition , by use of partial integrations we can rewrite the expression for the coupling coefficient @xmath263 as ( schenk et al 2002 ) _",
