    "rapidity is larger than one at midrapidity , the expected cnm effects from the phenix `` effective '' model at forward rapidity are larger than those at midrapidity and this leads to rapidity narrowing .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] c ) and f ) , rapidity narrowing in central au+au collisions is consistent with the expected cnm effects .",
