    "the idea of defining continuum fields from particle mechanics ( for the special case of pair potential interactions ) was pioneered in the landmark paper of irving and kirkwood@xcite .",
    "irving and kirkwood derived the equations of hydrodynamics from the principles of non - equilibrium classical statistical mechanics and in the process established pointwise definitions for various continuum fields . under this procedure ,",
    "basic continuum fields including the mass density , momentum density and the specific internal energy are defined _ a priori _ using a probability density function . using these definitions , expressions for the stress tensor and the heat flux vector fields",
    "are obtained that identically satisfy the balance laws of continuum mechanics .",
    "the continuum fields obtained in irving and kirkwood s original paper@xcite involved a series expansion of the dirac delta distribution , which is not mathematically rigorous . in a follow - up study , noll@xcite proved two lemmas , which allowed him to avoid the use of the delta distribution and to obtain closed - form analytical expressions for the continuum fields .    since the irving ",
    "kirkwood procedure is stochastic in nature , many problems arise when one tries to use the resulting expressions for a practical calculation  a key one being our lack of knowledge of the probability density function . to avoid these difficulties , hardy@xcite and independently murdoch@xcite developed a simpler spatial averaging procedure that avoids the mathematical complexity of the irving ",
    "kirkwood procedure .",
    "we refer to the procedure due to hardy as the _ hardy procedure _ and that due to murdoch as the _ murdoch procedure_. in these procedures , continuum fields are defined as direct spatial averages of the discrete equations of motion using a normalized weighting function .",
    "this approach also leads to a set of definitions that identically satisfy the balance equations .",
    "therefore , we have three different approaches for defining the continuum fields from particle mechanics  although originally developed for pair potentials only .    of the continuum fields ,",
    "the stress tensor has been studied most extensively .",
    "in addition to the definitions for the stress tensor obtained from the systematic approaches described above , a number of other definitions have been proposed in the past dating back to the work of cauchy@xcite on the stress vector and clausius@xcite on the virial stress .",
    "efforts at obtaining microscopic definitions for the stress tensor ( as well as other continuum variables ) are ongoing ; see for example refs@xcite for some important contributions .",
    "a recent article@xcite by the authors extensively studies the definition for the stress tensor within a unified framework based on a generalization of the irving  kirkwood procedure to arbitrary multi - body potentials followed by a process of spatial averaging . through this unified framework",
    "it is shown that all existing definitions , including the virial stress tensor,@xcite hardy stress tensor,@xcite and cauchy / tsai stress tensor,@xcite which all seem to be derived from disparate approaches , follow as special cases from a single stress expression .",
    "furthermore , the derivation in ref@xcite reveals the subtle ( and hitherto unrecognized issue ) that interatomic potentials constitute _ continuously differentiable extensions _ to functions defined over a more limited domain .",
    "this is a vital part of the derivation with important implications for the uniqueness of the microscopic stress tensor  an issue which is widely discussed in the literature cited above .",
    "although there have been a number of attempts to generalize the irving  kirkwood procedure and the hardy procedure to multi - body potentials ( see refs@xcite ) , these attempts are either restricted to specific potentials ( see refs@xcite ) or the source of non - uniqueness of the stress tensor is not explicitly identified .",
    "in contrast , the unified framework developed in ref@xcite applies to _ arbitrary _ multi - body potentials and rigorously characterizes the non - uniqueness of the stress tensor .",
    "the aim of this paper is to continue to use this unified framework to study the energy balance equation of continuum mechanics in the context of multi - body potentials .",
    "as noted earlier , in the original irving  kirkwood and the hardy procedure , the definition for the potential part of the specific internal energy ( for the special case of pair potentials in a mono - atomic system ) is assumed _ a priori _ and the expression for the heat flux vector is then derived to ensure that the energy balance equation is identically satisfied . unfortunately , this approach does not generalize to arbitrary multi - body potentials ( or even pair potentials with multiple species types ) since it involves an ambiguous definition for the `` energy of an atom '' .",
    "to the best of the authors knowledge , all the existing works ( see refs@xcite ) which attempt to derive a microscopic definition for the heat flux in the case of multi - body potentials by generalizing the irving  kirkwood procedure or the hardy procedure",
    "suffer from this ambiguity .",
    "for example , in ref@xcite it was assumed that the energy corresponding to a cluster of three particles interacting through a three - body potential is evenly distributed among the particles . however , there is no symmetry argument to justify this assumption .",
    "furthermore , even for the case of pair potential interactions , the original irving ",
    "kirkwood approach leads to an expression for the heat flux vector which is not invariant with respect to the addition of a constant to the potential energy of the system , which is not physically reasonable .",
    "in contrast , in the murdoch procedure , the specific internal energy and heat flux vector are obtained together as part of the derivation and the resulting expressions are consistent with physical expectations .",
    "motivated by this , in this paper , we reformulate the irving ",
    "kirkwood procedure using the method followed by murdoch@xcite .",
    "this approach leads to physically - acceptable expressions for the internal energy density and heat flux vector which are grounded in rigorous statistical mechanics principles and which does not require any energy decomposition between the particles .",
    "furthermore , as noted above , our derivation extends those of irving  kirkwood and murdoch to arbitrary multi - body potentials .",
    "finally , the application of the spatial averaging step in the unified procedure leads to expressions suitable for use in molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "these expressions are compared with those from the original irving ",
    "kirkwood formulation through a number of simple numerical experiments .",
    "the following notation is used in this paper .",
    "vectors are denoted by lower case letters in bold font , while tensors of higher order are denoted by capital letters in bold font .",

    "[ sec : intro ]",
    "consider a system modeled as a collection of @xmath10 point particles , each particle identified by an index @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the position , mass , and velocity of particle @xmath11 are denoted by @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the particles interact through a continuously differentiable function @xmath16 , which is called the _ potential energy _ of the system .",
    "the complete microscopic state of the system at any instant of time is known from the knowledge of position and velocity of each particle in @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the state of the system at time @xmath18 may be represented by a point in a @xmath19-dimensional phase space .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the phase space .",
    "therefore any point in @xmath20 , can be represented as , @xmath21 in reality , the microscopic state of the system is never known to us and the only observables identified are the macroscopic fields as defined in continuum mechanics .",
    "we identify the continuum fields with macroscopic observables obtained in a two - step process : ( 1 ) a pointwise field is obtained as a statistical mechanics phase average ; ( 2 ) a macroscopic field is obtained as a spatial average over the pointwise field .",
    "the phase averaging in step ( 1 ) is done with respect to a continuously differentiable as a generalized function / distribution in the sense of schwartz . for the sake of brevity",
    "we do not take this approach , however , we later use a generalized function / distribution as a candidate for @xmath22 to arrive at expressions for continuum fields that can be used in a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "see section  [ sec : md ] for details . ]",
    "probability density function @xmath23 defined on all phase space for all @xmath18 .",
    "the explicit dependence of @xmath22 on time @xmath18 , indicates that our system need not be in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the basic idea behind the original irving and kirkwood procedure is to prescribe the mass density , velocity and the specific internal energy fields , which we call the input fields , and derive the body force vector , stress tensor and the heat flux vector fields , which we call the output fields , such that all the definitions are consistent with the balance laws of mass , momentum and energy : @xmath24 to arrive at these definitions , we repeatedly use the following result of liouville s theorem , which describes the evolution of the probability density function : @xmath25 = 0.\\ ] ] since the force on a particle @xmath11 is given by @xmath26 equation ( [ eqn : liouville ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath27 = 0 , \\label{eqn : useful_liouville}\\ ] ] where , as stated before , @xmath28 denotes the potential energy of the system .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : useful_liouville ] ) is called _ liouville s",
    "equation_.    to proceed , we divide the potential energy into two parts :    1 .",
    "an _ external _ part , @xmath29 , associated with long - range interactions such as gravity or electromagnetic fields , 2 .",
    "an _ internal _ part , @xmath30 , associated with short - range particle interactions . in general , the internal part of the potential energy is also called the _ interatomic potential energy_.    we next define the input fields used in the irving  kirkwood procedure .      under the irving  kirkwood procedure ,",
    "pointwise fields are defined as phase averages .",
    "for example , the pointwise mass density field is defined as @xmath31 @xmath32 denotes the dirac delta distribution , and @xmath33 denotes summation from @xmath34 to @xmath10 . to avoid the dirac delta distribution and for greater clarity we adopt the notation introduced by noll .",
    "hence ( [ eqn : define_density_delta ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes an integral of @xmath22 over all its arguments except @xmath13 , and @xmath13 is substituted with @xmath37 .    the second input field , which is the pointwise velocity field , is defined via the momentum density field , @xmath38 , as follows : @xmath39 the third input field , which is the specific internal energy , depends on the interatomic potential . at this point",
    ", it must be noted that the original irving ",
    "kirkwood procedure was limited to systems interacting through a pair potential function : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the energy of particle @xmath11 , defined as @xmath42.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the energy corresponding to the interaction of the pair @xmath45 . in this case , the specific internal energy is defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the kinetic contribution to the specific internal energy , and @xmath48 is the potential contribution to the specific internal energy . according to the definition given in ( [ eqn : ener ] ) , the specific internal energy at @xmath49 is the weighted sum of the energy of each particle with the probability that it is at @xmath37 at time @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear from the definition in ( [ eqn : def_pot_alpha ] ) that the interaction energy @xmath43 , between any two particles @xmath11 and @xmath50 , is shared equally between the particles @xmath11 and @xmath50 .",
    "this is plausible for systems with identical particles interacting with pair potential , but there is no _ a priori _ physically motivated way of deciding how to distribute the energy for systems interacting through a multi - body potential .",
    "this is one of the primary reasons why the definition for the specific internal energy and the energy balance equation has to be re - examined as we do later in section  [ sec : ener_balance ] .",
    "it is clear from the definitions in ( [ eqn : define_density ] ) , ( [ eqn : define_mom_density ] ) , ( [ eqn : ener_kin ] ) and ( [ eqn : ener_pot ] ) that the integrals in these equations converge only under appropriate decay conditions@xcite on @xmath22 . under these condition ,",
    "any continuously differentiable vector or tensor - valued function defined on the phase space for all @xmath18 ( and satisfying certain additional decay conditions described in ref@xcite ) , we have is a second - order tensor or higher , then the dot product indicates tensor operating on a vector .",
    "note that in ( [ eqn : reg ] ) , in the interest of brevity , we are breaking our notation of denoting a second - order tensor operating on a vector by juxtaposition . ]",
    "[ eqn : reg ] @xmath51    the above identities are repeatedly used in deriving the equation of continuity , the equation of motion , and the energy balance equation in the irving  kirkwood procedure .      in this section ,",
    "we describe some properties of interatomic potentials , which play a crucial role in extending the original irving  kirkwood procedure to multi - body potentials .",
    "in addition , it gives new new insights into the original procedure which was limited to pair potentials .",
    "this section is largely based on ref@xcite , and is briefly summarized here for completeness and to define the necessary notation and terminology .    in general , the internal part of the potential energy , also called the _ interatomic potential energy _",
    ", depends on the positions of all particles in the system : @xmath52 where the `` hat '' indicates that the functional dependence is on absolute particle positions ( as opposed to distances later on ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath53 is a continuously differentiable function . due to the invariance of the potential energy with respect to rigid - body motions and reflections",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath30 in ( [ eqn : pot_pos_coord ] ) can be expressed as a new function@xcite @xmath54 where the argument of @xmath55 is an @xmath56 tuple of `` physically - realizable distances '' . before we describe what this means",
    ", we note that the @xmath56 distances between the @xmath10 particles embedded in @xmath17 are not independent .",
    "this can be easily seen for any collection of @xmath57 particles or more .",
    "therefore , the set of all @xmath56 tuples of physically realizable distances is a proper subset of @xmath58 . in fact , it is a @xmath59-dimensional manifold called the _ shape space _ of the system which is defined as @xmath60 for example , for a chain of 3 particles in one dimension , with positions @xmath61 , the three distances @xmath62 must satisfy @xmath63 .",
    "values of @xmath62 that do not satisfy this constraint are not `` physically realizable '' and are therefore outside the shape space manifold .    from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that the potential energy is only defined on the shape space of the system .",
    "we will soon see that in order to derive the stress tensor , we need to evaluate partial derivatives like the following : @xmath64 it is clear that this relation requires us to evaluate the potential energy outside the shape space since if @xmath65 is on @xmath66 then by adding @xmath67 to one of the distances , we move off it .",
    "thus , the expression in ( [ eqn : diff_extension ] ) makes sense only when we extend the function to the neighborhood of the shape space manifold ( see section 3.4 in ref@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "this is the reason we now restrict our discussion to those systems for which there exists a continuously differentiable extension of @xmath68 , defined on the shape space , to @xmath69 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because all interatomic potentials used in practice , for a system of @xmath10 particles , are either continuously differentiable functions on @xmath69 , or can easily be extended to one .",
    "for example , the pair potential and the embedded - atom method ( eam ) potential @xcite are continuously differentiable functions on @xmath69 , while the stillinger - weber @xcite and the tersoff @xcite potentials which depend on the angles between relative position vectors , can be easily extended to @xmath69 by expressing these angles as a function of distances between particles .",
    "therefore , we assume that there exists a continuously differentiable function @xmath70 , such that the restriction of @xmath30 to @xmath66 is equal to @xmath55 : @xmath71    an immediate question that arises is whether this extension is unique in a neighborhood of @xmath72 . note that for @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath73 , for every point @xmath72 , there exists a neighborhood in @xmath69 which lies in @xmath66 .",
    "however , for @xmath75 , there may be multiple extensions of @xmath76 .",
    "we will soon see that the quantity evaluated in ( [ eqn : diff_extension ] ) may differ for different extensions . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ internal _ force on any particle @xmath11 , @xmath77 is uniquely defined for any extension .",
    "we next address the possibility of having multiple extensions for the potential energy by studying the various constraints that the distances between particles must satisfy in order to be embeddable in @xmath17 .",
    "we demonstrate , through a simple example , how multiple extensions for the potential energy lead to a non - unique decomposition of the force on a particle , which in turn leads to a non - unique pointwise stress tensor .",
    "we first show that the force on a particle can always be decomposed as a sum of central forces regardless of the nature of the interatomic potential .",
    "the force on a particle due to internal interactions is defined in ( [ eqn : def_fi_int ] ) .",
    "this can also be evaluated using the continuously differentiable extension @xmath30 and the chain rule as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the contribution to the force on particle @xmath11 due to the presence of particle @xmath50 .",
    "note that @xmath80 is parallel to the direction @xmath81 and satisfies @xmath82 .",
    "this leads us to the important result that the _ internal force on a particle , for any interatomic potential that has a continuously differentiable extension , can always be decomposed as a sum of central forces , i.e. , forces parallel to directions connecting the particle to its neighbors_. this may seem strange to some readers due to the common confusion in the literature of using the term `` central - force model '' to refer exclusively to simple pair potentials .",
    "in fact , we see that due to the invariance requirement stated above , _ all _ interatomic potentials ( including those with explicit bond angle dependence ) that can be expressed as a continuously differentiable function of distance coordinates , are central - force models . by this",
    "we mean that the force on any particle ( say @xmath11 ) can be decomposed as a sum ( over @xmath50 ) of terms , @xmath80 , aligned with the vectors joining particle @xmath11 with its neighbors and satisfying action and reaction .",
    "the difference between a pair potential and a many - body potential is that in the former @xmath83 only depends on @xmath84 whereas in the latter @xmath83 can depend on the distances between all particles .",
    "the next question is how different potential energy extensions affect the force decomposition in ( [ eqn : f_decomp_general ] ) .",
    "we have already seen through ( [ eqn : def_fi_int ] ) that the force @xmath85 is independent of the particular extension used .",
    "however , we show below that the individual terms in the decomposition , @xmath80 , are _ not _ unique .",
    "these terms depend on the manner in which the potential energy , defined on the shape space , is extended to its neighborhood in @xmath69 .    in order to construct different extensions",
    ", we use the geometric constraints that the distances have to satisfy in order for them to be embeddable in @xmath17 .",
    "the nature of these constraints is studied in the field of _ distance geometry _ , which describes the geometry of sets of points in terms of the distances between them .",
    "one of the main results of this theory , is that the constraints are given by _",
    "cayley - menger determinants _ , which are related to the volume of a simplex formed by @xmath10 points in an @xmath86 dimensional space .",
    "the cayley  menger determinant corresponding to @xmath10 particles is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 .    in the following example",
    "we restrict ourselves to one dimension since the resulting expressions are short and easy to manipulate , although this example can be readily extended to any dimension .",
    "it is easy to see that in one dimension the number of independent coordinates are @xmath86 and for @xmath89 the number of interatomic distances exceeds the number of independent coordinates .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , consider as before a system consisting of three particles interacting in one dimension .",
    "the standard pair potential representation for this system , which is defined for all @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 we noted earlier that the distances between particles are geometrically constrained by the requirement that one of the distance is equal to the sum of the other two . in spite of this constraint , @xmath30 is defined for all values of @xmath94 .",
    "this clearly shows that the pair potential is already an extension .",
    "since the calculation gets unwieldy , let us again consider the special case where the particles are arranged to satisfy @xmath61 , for which @xmath95 . using ( [ eqn : f_decomp_general ] ) , the internal force , @xmath96 , evaluated at this configuration , is decomposed as @xmath97 we now construct an alternate extension to the standard pair potential representation given in ( [ eqn : pair_pot ] ) .",
    "this is done through the cayley - menger determinant corresponding to a cluster of three points , which follows from ( [ eqn : cayley ] ) as @xmath98 since the cayley ",
    "menger determinant is related to the area formed by the three particles , and the three particles are restricted to be in one - dimension , it follows that @xmath99 using the identity in ( [ eqn : cayley_1d ] ) , an alternate extension @xmath100 is constructed : @xmath101 note that @xmath100 is indeed an extension because from ( [ eqn : cayley_1d ] ) it is clear that @xmath100 is equal to @xmath102 at every point on the shape space of the system and it is continuously differentiable because @xmath103 , being a polynomial , is infinitely differentiable .",
    "let us now see how the internal force , @xmath104 , for the special configuration considered in this example , is decomposed using the new extension :    @xmath105    where in the above equation @xmath106 is a point in the shape space @xmath107 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ eqn : define_fij_pair ] ) and ( [ eqn : f1_decomp ] ) that the central - force decomposition is not the same for the two representations , i.e. , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , however the force on particle 1 , @xmath104 , is the same in both cases as expected .",
    "the equation of motion and the stress tensor for multi - body potentials has been extensively studied in the authors previous work@xcite .",
    "we now present those parts of the derivation which are necessary to derive the energy equation in section  [ sec : ener_balance ] .",
    "the equation of motion from continuum mechanics is given by @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the cauchy stress tensor and @xmath112 is the body force field . using liouville s equation and substituting in the definitions for mass density and the velocity fields defined in ( [ eqn : define_density ] ) and ( [ eqn : define_velocity ] ) , respectively , into ( [ eqn : motion ] )",
    ", it can be shown that the stress tensor and the body force field must satisfy @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the velocity of particle @xmath11 relative to the pointwise velocity field .",
    "it is natural to associate @xmath115 with the body force field @xmath112 in ( [ eqn : motion_5 ] ) .",
    "we therefore define @xmath116 as @xmath117 substituting ( [ eqn : body ] ) into ( [ eqn : motion_5 ] ) , we have @xmath118 from ( [ eqn : motion_6 ] ) , we see that the pointwise stress tensor has two contributions : @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are , respectively , the _ kinetic _ and _ potential _ parts of the pointwise stress . the kinetic part is given by @xmath122 it is evident that the kinetic part of the stress tensor is symmetric .",
    "the kinetic stress reflects the momentum flux associated with the vibrational kinetic energy portion of the internal energy .",
    "continuing with ( [ eqn : motion_6 ] ) , the potential part of the stress must satisfy the following differential equation : @xmath123 equation  ( [ eqn : stress_force_differential ] ) needs to be solved in order to obtain an explicit form for @xmath121 . in the original paper of irving and kirkwood @xcite , a solution to ( [ eqn : stress_force_differential ] )",
    "was obtained for the special case of pair potential interactions by applying a taylor expansion to the dirac delta distribution .",
    "in contrast , noll showed that a closed - form solution for @xmath121 can be obtained by recasting the right - hand side in a different form and applying a lemma proved in ref  @xcite .",
    "we proceed with noll s approach , except we place no restriction on the nature of the interatomic potential energy @xmath102 .",
    "we substitute the force decomposition given in ( [ eqn : f_decomp_general ] ) corresponding to a continuously differentiable extension into the potential part of the pointwise stress tensor in ( [ eqn : stress_force_differential ] ) to obtain @xmath124 on using the identity @xmath125 equation ( [ eqn : stress_force_differential _ * ] ) takes the form @xmath126 we now note the following lemma due to noll , which will be used to obtain a closed - form solution to the output fields derived in the irving  kirkwood procedure .",

    "@xmath121 is symmetric .",
    "this is clear because @xmath80 is parallel to @xmath142 and @xmath143 is symmetric .",
    "since the kinetic part of the stress in ( [ eqn : stress_kinetic ] ) is also symmetric , we can conclude that the _ pointwise stress tensor is symmetric for all interatomic potentials_. 3 .",
    "since @xmath121 depends on the nature of the force decomposition and different extensions of a given potential energy can result in different force decompositions , we conclude that the pointwise stress tensor is _ non - unique _ for all interatomic potentials ( including the pair potential ) .",
    "the non - uniqueness of the pointwise stress tensor also plays an important role in the energy equation , derived in the next section , since the stress appears in it .",

    "kirkwood procedure , lump the transport part into either the kinetic or potential parts of of the heat flux vector and do not observe it separately .",
    "hence , there has been no extensive numerical study of the role of this term . if indeed the expression for the transport part of the heat flux vector found in the irving ",
    "kirkwood procedure always has a negligible contribution to the heat flux vector , then its existence can be questioned .",
    "preliminary numerical simulations we conducted to explore this ( which are not reported here ) always yielded a negligible transport part .",
    "3 .   from section  [ sec : s_motion ] and section",
    "[ sec : ener_balance ] , it follows that the only ambiguity in the expressions obtained through this modified derivation is the non - uniqueness of the pointwise stress tensor , which is directly related to the force decomposition .",
    "it was shown in ref@xcite that this non - uniqueness vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in the previous sections we saw that various pointwise fields can be obtained through the irving  kirkwood procedure . as noted in section ii , the pointwise field are not continuum fields .",
    "we identify the continuum fields with macroscopic observables obtained in a two - step process :    1 .",
    "a pointwise field is obtained as a statistical mechanics phase average .",
    "a macroscopic field is obtained as a spatial average over the pointwise field .",
    "we have seen that the pointwise fields obtained in the first step are defined as phase averages with respect to a probability density function .",
    "typically a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation is purely deterministic in nature , meaning that at a given instant in time , we have a complete microscopic description of the system . due to this knowledge ,",
    "the probability density function introduced in the irving ",
    "kirkwood procedure reduces to a dirac delta distribution supported on the point in the phase space corresponding to the state of the system .",
    "if @xmath194 denotes the evolution of an md simulation , then the probability density function @xmath195 corresponding to an md simulation is given by @xmath196 therefore , in an md setting , the pointwise fields obtained in step 1 are localized to the particle positions .",
    "next , we spatially average these fields with respect to a normalized weighting function that has compact support , thus obtaining expressions for the continuum fields that can be numerically evaluated using the data generated in a md simulation .",
    "a macroscopic quantity is by necessity an average over some spatial region surrounding the continuum point where it is nominally defined .",
    "thus , if @xmath197 is an irving  kirkwood- pointwise field , such as density , stress or internal energy , the corresponding macroscopic field @xmath198 is given by @xmath199 where @xmath200 is a suitable weighting function .",
    "it is important to note that due to the linearity of the phase averaging in the irving ",
    "kirkwood procedure , the averaged macroscopic function @xmath198 satisfies the same balance equations as does the pointwise measure @xmath201 .",
    "the weighting function @xmath200 is a real - valued function with units of @xmath202 which satisfies the normalization condition @xmath203 this condition ensures that the correct macroscopic field is obtained when the pointwise field is uniform . for a spherically - symmetric function , @xmath204 , where @xmath205 .",
    "the normalization condition in this case is @xmath206 the simplest choice for @xmath207 is a spherically - symmetric uniform function over a specified radius @xmath208 , given by @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the volume of the sphere .",
    "this function is discontinuous at @xmath211 .",
    "if this is a concern , a `` mollifying function '' @xcite that smoothly takes @xmath212 to zero at @xmath208 over some desired range can be added ( see ( [ eqn : weight_molly ] ) ) .",
    "other possible choices include for example gaussian functions@xcite , or spline function used in meshless methods@xcite ( see ref@xcite for details ) .",
    "many physical interpretations can be given to the weighting function .",
    "see ref@xcite for further details .    one possible interpretation for a positive - valued @xmath213 with compact support ( as described above ) can be related to the physical nature of the experimental probe measuring the continuum fields . in this case",
    ", the size of the compact support represents the length scale over which continuum fields are being measured . an alternative approach described by murdoch and bedeaux@xcite",
    "is based on the requirement that `` repeated spatial averaging should produce nothing new '' . in other words , spatially averaging a quantity that was already spatially averaged should give the same average .",
    "this leads to a definite form for the weighting function that also takes on negative values .",
    "it is straightforward to see that substituting the expression given in ( [ eqn : w_md ] ) for the probability density function into ( [ eqn : define_se_0 ] ) and performing the spatial averaging defined there using any weighting function discussed above , we obtain expressions for continuum fields that can be numerically evaluated using the data generated from an md simulation . for example",
    ", let us look at the mass density field given in ( [ eqn : define_density ] ) and repeated here with @xmath214 : @xmath215 spatially averaging this distribution with respect to the weighting function results in @xmath216 where @xmath217 denotes the continuum mass density field obtained by the spatial averaging of the pointwise field @xmath218 with respect to the weighting function @xmath213",
    ". similarly , all other continuum definitions for an md simulation are obtained from their probabilistic versions .",
    "following is a catalog of definitions for continuum fields that can be evaluated in any md simulation :    @xmath219    the expressions for @xmath220 and @xmath221 given in ( [ eqn : sigmav_avg ] ) and ( [ eqn : qv_avg ] ) respectively , can be further simplified by the following simple change of variables : @xmath222 which implies that @xmath223 the jacobian of the transformation is @xmath224 = \\det \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }    \\bm{i }            & -\\bm{i }        \\\\ ( 1-s ) \\bm{i }   & s\\bm{i }   \\end{array } \\right ] = 1 .",

    "these expressions constitute a generalization to many - body potentials of expressions originally given by hardy@xcite for the special case of pair potentials ( noting that our expressions for the internal energy density and heat flux vector which have modified forms ) .",
    "other commonly - used definitions like the virial stress@xcite and the tsai traction@xcite can be obtained as limiting cases of the above relations ( see ref@xcite for details ) .",
    "we therefore see that our formulation is unified in the sense that it shows how all of these relations are related and provides a single framework that encompasses them all .",
    "it was mentioned at the end of section  [ sec : ener_balance ] that the definitions obtained in the new derivation are quite different and some qualitative differences were identified .",
    "we now try to see how the definitions vary quantitatively .",
    "various stress tensors obtained through this unified framework were studied in ref@xcite by the authors . in this section , we describe molecular dynamics simulations that are carried out to compare the following two quantities : @xmath230 here @xmath231 is the local spatial average of the potential part of the specific internal energy in the original irving  kirkwood formulation .",
    "@xmath232 is the corresponding expression in the new formulation taken from ( [ eqn : ewv_md ] ) .",

    "since the unified framework applies to arbitrary multi - body potentials , it would have been ideal to choose a multi - body potential for our numerical experiments .",
    "unfortunately , since as mentioned in the introduction , there is no rigorous way to distribute the total energy among particles , the expression for @xmath235 in ( [ eqn : ewv_ik_md_comp ] ) is ill - defined .",
    "thus the only possibility for comparison is in the special case of pair potential interactions in a system of identical particles . in this case due to symmetry",
    ", it is reasonable to divide the energy equally among the particles ( see footnote  ) , thus arriving at a plausible definition for @xmath231 .",
    "we will see that even in this case the expressions in ( [ eqn : ewv_ik_md_comp ] ) and ( [ eqn : ewv_md_comp ] ) are not equivalent . in more general cases , we argue that only the new expression in ( [ eqn : ewv_md_comp ] ) is well - defined .",
    "our system consists of particles arranged in a face - centered cubic crystal , stacked together in the form of @xmath236 unit cells , interacting through a modified lennard - jones type potential .",
    "the lennard - jones parameter , @xmath67 and @xmath237 are arbitrarily set to 1 .",

    "note that the longer wavelength oscillations in energy in these plots correspond to the pulsing of the sample as it expands and contracts about its mean thermally - expanded size .",
    "it is also interesting to see how these continuum fields change as the averaging domain size is decreased . as mentioned previously , as the weighting function tends to the dirac delta distribution , we expect the continuum fields to also become localized with increasing magnitude . to see if this is indeed the case , we decrease the size of the averaging domain by choosing @xmath259 , which corresponds to a length of @xmath260 unit cells .",

    "[ fig : nopbc_rsp0.2_ev_compare ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : nopbc_rsp0.8_ev_compare ] , we see that for the smaller domain , @xmath232 is greater than four times @xmath231 , whereas they were equal for the larger domain .",
    "moreover , the contribution due to @xmath253 to the specific internal energy is larger than that due to @xmath261 .",
    "this clearly shows that for small averaging domains , the two definitions given by ( [ eqn : ewv_ik_md_comp ] ) and ( [ eqn : ewv_md_comp ] ) are quite different in nature .",
    "based on our observations , we can conclude that @xmath232 tends to localize more strongly with the averaging domain size than does @xmath231 .    to rationalize these results ,",
    "let us consider what happens to these definitions as the weighting function tends to a delta distribution .",
    "in this case , @xmath231 ( see ( [ eqn : ewv_ik_md_comp ] ) ) localizes to the particle positions .",
    "the same also happens to all terms in the definition of @xmath232 ( see ( [ eqn : ewv_md_comp ] ) ) _ except _ for @xmath262 .",
    "this term localizes to the lines joining the particles rather than onto the particles themselves .",
    "this observation provides a qualitative explanation , although not complete , for the different behavior of the two definitions shown above .",
    "in this paper , we present a two - step _ unified framework _ for the evaluation of continuum field expressions from molecular simulations : ( 1 ) pointwise continuum fields are obtained using a generalization of the irving  kirkwood procedure to arbitrary multi - body potentials , and ( 2 ) spatial averaging is applied to obtain the corresponding macroscopic quantities . the latter lead to expressions suitable for computation in molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "it is shown that the important commonly - used microscopic definitions for continuum fields are recovered in this process as special cases .    in generalizing the irving ",
    "kirkwood to arbitrary many - body potentials we have had to address two ambiguities inherent in the original procedure which lead to non - uniqueness in the resulting expressions .",
    "the first ambiguity arises due to the non - uniqueness of the partitioning of the force on an atom as a sum of central forces , which is directly related to the non - uniqueness of the potential energy representation in terms of distances between particles .",
    "this is in turn related to the shape space of the system .",
    "the conclusion is that the pointwise stress tensor is _ not _ unique , however we show in ref@xcite that the macroscopic stress obtained via spatial averaging becomes unique as the spatial averaging domain is taken to infinity .    the second ambiguity in the original irving  kirkwood procedure arises due to the arbitrary decomposition of energy between particles .",
    "we show that this decomposition can be completely avoided through an alternative derivation for the energy balance equation .",
    "this leads to new definitions for the specific internal energy and the heat flux vector .",
    "in particular , the resulting potential part of the specific internal energy does not depend on the arbitrary partitioning of the potential energy to individual particles , and the resulting heat flux vector does not contain the `` transport part '' which is not invariant with respect to the addition of a constant to the potential energy function .    the new definition for the specific internal energy is compared with the original irving ",
    "kirkwood definition through a series of numerical experiments .",
    "although our expression applies to arbitrary many - body potentials , we have chosen to perform the comparisons for the special case of a system of identical particles interacting through a pair potential since this is the only case where the original irving  kirkwood internal energy density is well - defined .",
    "this is due to the ambiguity in the decomposition of energy between the particles in the original irving ",
    "kirkwood derivation ( and existing extensions to the approach ) . in our numerical experiments , we observe that both definitions agree for weighting functions with support given by a ball of radius 0.6 unit cells and larger . however , as the weighting function tends to a delta distribution , the two definitions scale differently . a qualitative theoretical explanation for this difference is given based on the limiting behavior of the two definitions as the averaging domain tends to a point .",
    "it would also be of interest to compare the new expression for the heat flux vector to the original irving  kirkwood expression . in order to do this",
    ", one has to study the transport part of the heat flux .",
    "to our knowledge , this has not been done in the past because the transport part is normally lumped into either the kinetic or potential parts of the heat flux and not observed separately .",
    "our new derivation shows that its existence is directly related to the arbitrariness in the energy decomposition .",
    "preliminary numerical studies of some systems ( not reported here ) suggest that the transport part of the heat flux vector , which is absent in the new derivation , tends to be negligible .",

    "<S> kirkwood procedure to arbitrary multi - body potentials . </S>",
    "<S> two ambiguities associated with the original irving  kirkwood procedure ( which was limited to pair potential interactions ) are addressed in its generalization . </S>",
    "<S> the first ambiguity is due to the non - uniqueness of the decomposition of the force on an atom as a sum of central forces , which is a result of the non - uniqueness of the potential energy representation in terms of distances between the particles . </S>",
    "<S> this is in turn related to the _ shape space _ of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the second ambiguity is due to the non - uniqueness of the energy decomposition between particles . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be completely avoided through an alternate derivation for the energy balance . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the expressions for the specific internal energy and the heat flux obtained through the alternate derivation are quite different from the original irving  </S>",
    "<S> kirkwood procedure and appear to be more physically reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> next , in the second step of the unified framework , spatial averaging is applied to the pointwise field to obtain the corresponding macroscopic quantities . these lead to expressions suitable for computation in molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the important commonly - used microscopic definitions for the stress tensor and heat flux vector are recovered in this process as special cases ( generalized to arbitrary multi - body potentials ) . </S>",
    "<S> several numerical experiments are conducted to compare the new expression for the specific internal energy with the original one . </S>"
