    "air traffic control ( atc ) is the backbone of what is arguably the key means of personal transport in the modern world .",
    "as traffic continues to grow dramatically , atc has to manage ever more aircraft .",
    "large european airports , such as london heathrow or frankfurt / main , experience spikes of more than 1,500 daily take - offs and landings , and industry forecasts predict that world - wide flight movements will double between 2015 and 2034 @xcite .",
    "additionally , as unmanned aerial vehicles ( uav ) enter the civil airspace , they must learn to co - exist with manned aircraft and existing air traffic control systems .",
    "while forecasts project a steady 5% annual increase of global manned flight traffic over the next 20 years , uav are projected to outgrow traditional air traffic by several orders of magnitude : in 2035 , 250,000 uav are expected to be operating in the us alone , compared to a mere 45,000 passenger aircraft around the globe @xcite . however , as this paradigm shift progresses , many technological issues have yet to be solved to ensure the safe control of both manned and unmanned aircraft .",
    "the key issue in controlling the airspace is to know where an aircraft is at any given time .",
    "for the pilot , this is achieved through navigational aids , such as distance measuring equipment ( dme ) or , more recently , satellite navigation . for ground controllers ,",
    "the traditional options to obtain an aircraft s position comprise voice communication via vhf / hf and primary and secondary surveillance radar ( psr and ssr , respectively ) .",
    "recently , technological developments and stricter separation needs have given rise to other methods of aircraft localization , most notably the the automatic dependent broadcast  protocol ( ads - b ) and multilateration ( mlat ) .    while ads - b relies purely on the aircraft correctly broadcasting their own position to other aircraft and ground stations , mlat can provide an independent means of localization by exploiting the time differences of arrival ( tdoa ) of signals received at several different ground stations .",
    "both methods achieve greatly increased localization accuracy compared to previous radar surveillance and are key technologies in next generation atc concepts such as sesar or nextgen @xcite .    at the same time , crowdsourced air traffic communication networks have gained importance over the past decade .",
    "large private companies such as flightradar24 and planefinder , research networks such as opensky , enthusiast websites , and increasingly flight authorities themselves @xcite rely less and less on planned deployments of atc receivers .",
    "instead they use distributed networks that are randomly deployed from the local to the global level .",
    "contrary to traditional , carefully planned receiver networks , this crowdsourced use of cheap sensors provides a number of new challenges to the existing localization algorithms .    in this work , we investigate alternatives to multilateration for independent localization in air traffic communication networks .",
    "we present a new method based on expected tdoas , which is robust in noisy environments and does not depend on the system s receiver geometry .",
    "we show that it is effective even in unplanned deployments of cheap , crowd - sourced , off - the - shelf atc receiver networks .",
    "our approach does not require changes to existing technology standards or to the aircraft s legacy hardware equipment , which is particularly important given aviation s long adoption and certification cycles @xcite .",
    "we make the following contributions in this paper : +    * we develop a new grid - based method to localize aircraft based on their wireless communication .",
    "we utilize a new combination of the k - nearest neighbor algorithm and the expected time differences of arrival of atc signals to estimate their origin . + * we analyse the disadvantages of multilateration , the current state of the art solution for aircraft localization .",
    "concretely , we examine the robustness in noisy environments , the coverage in a typical air traffic surveillance area , and the efficiency of the signal usage . +",
    "* we evaluate our approach on real - world data and show that it performs better in wide area settings than multilateration .",
    "compared to the latter , our approach is cheaper and more scalable , and improves surveillance range , detection speed and location accuracy in real - world environments .",
    "in particular , our approach is much less dependent on perfect system geometry .",
    "+ * finally , we study the effectiveness of verifying air traffic control data .",
    "we show that verification of legitimate and false flight data using our approach is quicker and can also provide improved localization of the origin of false data injections on or near the ground .",
    "we have introduced the core localization idea in the 1st acm workshop on cyber - physical system security ( cpss 15 ) , using it for security and data verification purposes only @xcite .",
    "this journal version is fully rewritten , focusing on the localization part and providing extensive analysis concerning the benefits in modern crowdsourced air traffic communication sensor networks .",
    "we have provided new data and new findings to substantiate our approach , including the theoretical underpinning of expected tdoas , a robustness analysis , a new discussion of its usefulness for verification , and extensive comparisons with multilateration in crowdsourced networks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : background ] discusses the background necessary for the aircraft localization problem , including the related work .",
    "section [ sec : multilateration ] analyzes the problems of multilateration while section [ sec : tdoa - coverage ] illustrates the differences between tdoa - based algorithms .",
    "section [ sec : design ] explains the concept of expected tdoas , and how it can be exploited for lightweight aircraft localization .",
    "section [ sec : experimental - design ] details our experimental setup , whereas section [ sec : evaluation ] evaluates the scheme against real - world flight data .",
    "section [ sec : attack - detection ] examines the scheme s data verification effectiveness .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes and concludes this work .",
    "]    since world war ii , atc surveillance data has been provided by psr and ssr in various forms .",
    "psr is a term comprising non - cooperative radar localization systems that use a rotating antenna radiating a pulse position - modulated and highly directional electromagnetic beam on a low ghz band .",
    "the pulses are returned by all reflecting targets in the airspace ; measuring the bearing and round trip time provides the targets positions .    in contrast , ssr is a cooperative technology comprising the so - called transponder modes a , c , and s. ground stations interrogate the transponders of aircraft in range using digital messages on the 1030 mhz frequency , which reply with the requested information on the 1090 mhz channel .",
    "ssr provides additional target information compared to psr besides the position , including identity and altitude .",
    "one of the most recently introduced atc technologies is the ads - b protocol , which is the satellite - based successor of ssr .",
    "it is currently being rolled out in most airspaces and promises lower cost and more accurate surveillance  @xcite .",
    "contrary to primary and secondary radar , it does not rely on interrogations . using two potential datalinks ( 1090 extended squitter , or universal access transceiver )",
    ", the aircraft automatically broadcasts its position and velocity ( twice per second ) as well as its identification ( every five seconds ) to all other aircraft and ground stations in the vicinity ( see fig . [",
    "fig : overview - ads - b ] for an illustration ) .    as it is possible to capture all popular wireless protocols with cheap off - the - shelf wireless receivers , crowdsourced sensor networks",
    "have increased in popularity over recent years @xcite . using any wireless receiver such as popular software - defined radios ,",
    "any signal sent by the aircraft , including ads - b and ssr , can be used for tdoa - based localization such as multilateration @xcite .      to be able to develop an appropriate localization method ,",
    "in particular for crowdsourced networks , it is crucial to first identify the characteristics of the atc environment .",
    "the following characteristics distinguish the aircraft localization problem from other wireless localization problems ( e.g. , wireless sensor networks or vehicular ad hoc networks ) :    * * outdoor line - of - sight environment : * contrary to many localization problems found in academic research , the aircraft location problem is naturally outdoors . on the 1090mhz channel",
    ", the line of sight ( los ) is a crucial factor in receiving signals .",
    "we require an outdoor los propagation model for our work in terms of loss and propagation . * * vast distances : * in _ wide area _",
    "atc surveillance , the distances covered are naturally much larger than in more local or indoor problems .",
    "aircraft flying at cruising altitudes ( typically 35,000 feet or higher for commercial aircraft ) can be observed up to the radio horizon of 400 km or more .",
    "this is orders of magnitude larger than typical indoor localization problems .",
    "* * few multipath effects : * at typical aircraft cruising altitudes , we experience comparably few diffractions leading to multipath effects that influence signal characteristics .",
    "this enables us to use simpler theoretical models than in more complex indoor and multipath - rich environments .",
    "most importantly , the propagation timings between aircraft positions and sensors can be approximated easily by using the speed of light @xmath0 .",
    "indoor and outdoor localization problems have been studied extensively in the literature , often in the scope of sensor networks and radar applications .",
    "liu et al.@xcite give an overview of the techniques used in wireless indoor positioning including the different algorithms ( k - nearest neighbor , lateration , least squares and bayesian among others ) and primitives such as received signal strength ( rss ) , tdoa , time of arrival ( toa ) and angle of arrival ( aoa ) .",
    "rss - based methods are the most popular within any type of wireless networks as they are often readily supported out of the box and do not require additional hardware such as high precision clocks or antenna arrays .",
    "while tdoa systems are limited in indoor environments ( due to multipath effects and non - availability of time synchronization and clocks fine - grained enough to provide good results at very short distances @xcite ) , they offer very superior performance in long - distance outdoor environments such as those encountered in the aircraft localization problem where the non - line - of - sight error is not the dominant error source @xcite .",
    "errors in rss - based outdoor localization are typically much larger , ranging up to a few hundred meters already in comparatively small outdoor settings of 2 km @xcite .    in terms of algorithms ,",
    "the k - nearest neighbors ( k - nn ) algorithm has proven to do very well in short - distance , indoor rss fingerprinting compared to other methods @xcite , although it has been studied less in long - distance scenarios ( such as aircraft localization ) and can become computationally more expensive with very large databases .    ]",
    "overall , the main ( distributed ) localization approach used within aviation is mlat @xcite , which we discuss in detail in the next section and which provides the baseline for our evaluations . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the combination of the k - nn algorithm with tdoa as a primitive has not been studied . in the following ,",
    "we argue that this combination is beneficial in particular for crowdsourced networks with random , imperfect system geometry in which the performance of mlat suffers strongly .",
    "mlat is a proven and well - understood concept that is used in civil and military navigation and already serves as a backup for atc around some airports .",
    "it has been the consensus solution in academia and aviation circles as a backup solution for primary and secondary radar @xcite .      to localize the 2d - origin of a signal using mlat , three ( or more ) receiver stations measure the time at which they receive the same message from an aircraft .",
    "they send this data to the central processing station which can calculate the aircraft s position from the intersecting hyperboloids that result from the time difference of arrival between the receiver stations .    traditionally , the algorithms to solve this problem are classified into open form ( or iterative ) and closed form ( or direct ) .",
    "this classification of algorithms is based on their need of information from external sources : those that require a previous estimation of the solution are considered open form and those that do not require such information are closed form .",
    "mantilla - gaviria et al.@xcite discuss the different mlat models used for airport surface surveillance and classify them into three main categories : numerical , statistical and algebraic .",
    "the resulting problem obtained by these models is then numerically solved , e.g. , by using least squares or singular value decomposition - based regularization .      however , despite its popularity , mlat suffers from a number of known pitfalls .",
    "first , mlat is highly susceptible to noise , outliers , and even minor measurement errors outside a small core area .",
    "an important quality metric for a deployment and its mlat accuracy with respect to the target object s relative position is the _ geometric dilution of precision _ , or gdop ( see fig.[fig : geometric - dilution - of ] ) .",
    "it describes the effect of a deployment on the relationship between the errors of the obtained tdoa measurements and their resulting impact on the final errors in the object s calculated position , or formally : @xmath1 gdop is widely used in positioning systems such as gps , where good ratings for this multiplier are commonly considered to be below 6 , with 10 to be fair and everything over 20 to be of poor quality @xcite . for",
    "a full explanation of how to calculate different dop values , please see @xcite .",
    "+    ]    second , traditional mlat systems are very expensive : where ads - b needs only a single receiver for accurate wide area surveillance of up to 400 km , mlat requires every signal to be received by at least three stations with little noise . on top of this , geographical obstacles ( e.g. , mountain ranges , oceans ) make it relatively more difficult to install a comprehensive wide area system at the desired service level .",
    "however , even where this is not a problem , mlat s discussed dilution of precision characteristics necessitate a well - planned system geometry to accurately cover a given area @xcite ; an unplanned , or crowdsourced sensor network deployment can not typically provide good enough gdop values to achieve the same service quality .",
    "+ considering these drawbacks and the fact that modern crowdsourced networks with cheap off - the shelf sensors are becoming more popular , there is a need for other tdoa - based approaches that can improve on these problems .    ]",
    "one of our main goals is to tackle mlat s scalability and coverage problems , especially in deployments with less than perfect system geometry .",
    "an atc data communications network consists of a given number of sensors that are deployed outside , in a line of sight with the airspace they are expected to cover . naturally , overlapping reception ranges between receivers are required to obtain tdoas .",
    "if more sensors are to receive the same message , they need to be located closer together .",
    "while this increases the overlap , it also decreases the overall ads - b coverage of the receivers .",
    "worse even , only a small part of the mlat coverage is usable , since gdop causes its accuracy to deteriorate quickly .",
    "methods not suffering from gdop and working with fewer sensors could vastly improve efficiency compared to mlat .",
    "figure [ fig : dop - map ] illustrates the dilution of precision experienced by multilateration in our crowdsourced deployment using 8 ads - b sensors . covering an area of 3 degrees longitude @xmath2 3 degrees latitude at an altitude of 38,000 feet , it is indicative of a wide area multilateration system used for en - route airspace surveillance .",
    "as can be observed , the darkest areas , which illustrate the lowest gdop values , only make up a fraction of the surveillance area , while the system s geometry causes most parts to have unusably high dilution of precision .",

    ". 38,000 ft ) using 8 opensky sensors from an unplanned and crowdsourced deployment in switzerland . table [ tab : messages ] illustrates the number of messages that are picked up by a given number of receivers .",
    "only 14% of all received messages are seen by 3 or more sensors on the ground and can be used for mlat . if we take into account gdop , we are left with only 5.24% of usable messages .    if we look at the area covered , we find that in our deployment the mlat coverage makes up roughly 17% of the overall covered area .",
    "the area where mlat is reliably accurate is even smaller , only 6.67% of the total area is covered by messages with a gdop of less than 10 .",
    "thus , the usability of the received ads - b messages for mlat is reduced by a factor of more than 2.5 compared to localization methods that do not suffer from gdop .",
    "we propose a grid - based k - nn approach which does not suffer from dilution of precision and works accurately regardless of the system geometry .",
    "as laid out above , this characteristic increases the signal utilisation and overall coverage of a deployment , thus vastly reducing costs and improving the detection range and speed of new aircraft at the same time .    .",
    "subtracting the smallest time @xmath5 from the other times gives the tdoas relative to receiver @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig : a - simple - example ] ]      the key insight of our approach is the use of _ expected tdoas_. as outlined before , the time differences of arrival of a received signal between multiple sensors are a physical primitive that can be used to establish the possible location(s ) of a sender . for our approach ,",
    "we extend this concept and ( pre-)calculate the time differences that we would _ expect _ to see based on any given location .",
    "concretely , we can use an idealized outdoor los propagation model suitable for the aircraft localization problem .",
    "we then calculate the absolute propagation times of an atc signal s origin to the receiving ground stations by dividing the distances @xmath7 between the sender and each of the stations @xmath8 by the speed of light @xmath0 ( see fig.[fig : a - simple - example ] ) .",

    "our results show that the mean aircraft location accuracy can be increased by up to 41% in comparison with an algebraic mlat algorithm .",
