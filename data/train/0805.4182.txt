    "in the renormalization group ( rg ) framework , landau s theory of fermi liquids is characterized by the irrelevance of the interactions of particles near the fermi surface , in other words the low energy fixed point is simply a free theory of fermions .",
    "the underlying reasons for the wide success of landau / fermi liquid theory are well - understood@xcite , and consequently the known models of non - landau / fermi liquids are relatively rare .",
    "( henceforth referred to simply as non - fermi liquids . )",
    "an important exception is the luttinger liquid and other related models consisting of quartic interactions of dirac fields in @xmath8 spatial dimension . here",
    "the non - fermi liquid behavior can be attributed to the fact that in @xmath9 , quartic interactions of dirac fields are marginal operators in the rg sense . in higher dimensions",
    "quartic interactions of dirac fermions are irrelevant and this is one of the reasons why candidate non - fermi liquid models were not found in the previous works . whereas more exotic non - fermi liquid models have been proposed which typically involve gauge fields , the lack of non - fermi liquid models in @xmath1 appears paradoxical when one considers even the simplest models of itinerant electrons with quartic interactions , such as the hubbard or t - j model , which are believed to be at strong coupling . since",
    "such models have been proposed as good starting points for thinking about high @xmath10 superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite , it is certainly worthwhile to continue to try and construct relatively non - exotic models of continuum fermions with quartic interactions that have some resemblance to the hubbard model and have non - fermi liquid behavior in the normal state .    though the search for a novel kind of non - fermi liquid in @xmath1 provided one of the main initial motivations for the formulation of the model that will be presented and analyzed in this work , the model turns out to have many unexpected bonus features , almost all of which are intrinsic to @xmath1 .",
    "we list the most prominent :     the 4-fermion interaction is unique for spin @xmath11 electrons and automatically has @xmath4 symmetry . in @xmath1",
    "the interactions are relevant and the model has a low energy interacting fixed point with non - classical exponents which can be computed perturbatively .",
    "the model generalizes to @xmath12 flavors , where @xmath13 corresponds to spin @xmath11 electrons , and has @xmath14 symmetry . since @xmath2 this provides a underlying framework based on a microscopic theory for exploring the ideas of zhang based on @xmath4@xcite .",
    "in particular one can derive the effective ginzburg - landau theory .     because of the @xmath4 symmetry the model naturally has both anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) and superconducting ( sc ) order parameters that form the 5-dimensional vector representation of @xmath4 .",
    "for repulsive interactions the model has af order and no sc order in mean field approximation .",
    "when one incorporates momentum dependent scattering to 1-loop to go beyond mean field , an attractive d - wave channel opens up and the momentum dependence of the gap can be calculated .",
    "this d - wave sc phase terminates on the over - doped side at the rg fixed point , which is a quantum critical point .",
    "due to mathematical properties of the d - wave gap equation , it also terminates on the under - doped side yielding a `` dome '' . due to the properties of the rg flow",
    ", this attractive d - wave instability exists for arbitrarily strong repulsive interactions at short distances .",
    "although the model may be at arbitrarily strong coupling at short distances , the low energy fixed point is at a relatively small coupling @xmath15 , and this renders the model perturbatively calculable .",
    "we are thus able to calculate the main features of the complete phase diagram as a function of a doping variable , including the phase boundary of the d - wave superconducting dome and estimate the optimal doping fraction , which is near @xmath16 .",
    "this phase diagram depends on a single parameter @xmath17 which encodes the ratio of the strength of the coupling at short versus long distances . in the figure",
    "below , we summarize the results of our calculations for @xmath18 , which corresponds to infinite coupling at short distances .",
    "the overall scale of temperature is set by the universal nodal fermi velocity and the lattice spacing .     determined by the strength of the interaction at short distances .",
    "we set @xmath18 corresponding to infinitely strong coupling .",
    "the vertical axis represents the low energy scale relative to the cut - off .",
    "what is shown are solutions @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the af and d - wave gap equations ( [ af.1b],[orb.7 ] ) in units of the cut - off @xmath21 .",
    "the critical temperatures are proportional to these gaps with constants of order unity which we estimate , eqns .",
    "( [ neeltemp],[tcsc ] ) .",
    "the overall temperature scale is determined by the universal nodal fermi velocity and lattice spacing ( [ tcev ] ) .",
    "the running coupling @xmath22 in the gap equations is in terms of @xmath23 in eq .",

    "the hole - hoping @xmath24 is the one loop corrected expression ( [ dope.2 ] ) .",

    "( [ phase.1b ] ) , and represents the boundary to the pseudogap region . the af transition point at @xmath26 is first order .",
    "the sc transition at @xmath27 is second - order and corresponds to the fixed point of the renormalization group , i.e. a quantum critical point .",
    "the transition point @xmath28 is not universal , but relies on mathematical properties of the gap equation.,width=453 ]    [ figureintro ]    many of the above properties were highlighted on a list of the most important features of high @xmath10 superconductivity compiled early on in the subject@xcite . because of the importance of the @xmath29 planes , high @xmath10 is believed to be essentially a @xmath1 phenomenon .",
    "this , along with the detailed properties of the solution of our model , in particular the phase diagram , led us to propose it as a model of high @xmath10 superconductivity@xcite .",
    "if our theory turns out to be the correct description , it reveals that the phenomenon of high @xmath10 superconductivity is remarkably universal , with a single energy scale , and its main features follow from the existence of the low energy fixed point in @xmath1 .",
    "it is truly a beautiful phenomenon that has managed to realize some subtle theoretical loopholes in the usual requirements of unitarity , the spin - statistics theorem , and the mermin - wagner theorem , which are only possible in @xmath1 .",
    "our theory represents a significant departure from the models considered thus far in connection with high @xmath10 , which are reviewed in @xcite , along with reviews of experimental results . on the other hand , we believe it represents a particular scaling limit of the hubbard model at and just below half - filling , and is in this sense conservative in comparison with other more exotic ideas , and is thus in line with the early ideas concerning the rle of af order and the heisenberg and hubbard models@xcite . however our model is nt simply a direct scaling limit of the hubbard model with no attention paid to the fermi surface , since the latter only has an @xmath30 symmetry , whereas our theory has the @xmath4 symmetry . in our theory the `` fermion sign '' problem",
    "is solved by doing analytic , perturbative calculations in a fermionic theory from the beginning , and relatively simple 1-loop calculations already reveal the main features",
    ".    irregardless of whether our model has been exactly realized in the laboratory , it can serve as a useful tool for exploring many of the paradigms in the area of strongly correlated electrons and also for developing new methods .",
    "for instance , we develop new gap equations that take into account higher order scattering of cooper pairs near the fermi surface .",
    "our analysis shows clearly how in @xmath1 one can obtain a momentum dependent gap with a d - wave structure from a rotationally invariant continuum field theory , i.e. without an explicit lattice that breaks the rotational symmetry .",
    "this is interesting especially since the precise origin of the d - wave symmetry of the sc gap has been unclear .",
    "we also show how to introduce doping in terms of the coupling and rg scale , and a small non - zero temperature as a relativistic mass coupling .    for the remainder of this introduction we outline the organization of the paper and summarize our main results . in section ii",
    "we motivate the model by showing how it can approximately describe particles and holes near a circular fermi surface .",
    "the manner in which we expand around the fermi surface is in the same spirit as in @xcite but differs in some important ways . for a single spin - less fermion one",
    "thereby obtains a free hamiltonian of particles and holes with a massless , i.e. relativistic dispersion relation . in section iii",
    "we insist on a local quantum field description of the effective theory near the fermi surface with a consistent quantization . since the particles are massless , the only known candidate field theories are either dirac or `` symplectic '' fermions , which differ primarily by being first versus second order in space - time derivatives respectively . for the remainder of the paper we focus on symplectic fermions since unlike the dirac fermions ,",
    "the interactions are relevant .",
    "the model was first proposed in this context by one of us@xcite , where the groundwork was done on the low energy non - fermi liquid fixed point and in part the af properties ; at the time the sc properties were unknown .",
    "as explained in the present paper , the central idea of this previous work , that the af order parameter is bilinear in symplectic fermion fields and that the low energy rg fixed point describes a quantum critical point , appears to be correct ; however as we will see , the quantum critical point terminates the sc rather than af phase .",
    "quantum critical points in the context of high @xmath10 were emphasized earlier by vojta and sachdev@xcite .",
    "the issue of the unitarity of our theory was mostly resolved in @xcite by noting that the hamiltonian is pseudo - hermitian and this is sufficient for a unitary time evolution . in this paper ,",
    "the expansion around the fermi surface provides a new view on the pseudo - hermiticity and it is explained how it is related to the kinematics of particles versus holes .",
    "the critical exponents were computed to 2-loops in @xcite , which corrected some errors in@xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyze many more properties , in particular the af and d - wave sc ordering properties for the first time .    since the consistency of the quantization of a fermionic theory with a lagrangian that is second order in time derivatives is at the heart of the unitarity issue , in section iv we work out in detail the @xmath31 dimensional quantum mechanical case where all the subtle consistency issues are present .",
    "in this section we also construct the conserved charges for the @xmath14 symmetry . in section v the field theory version in @xmath32 spatial dimensions is defined and spin and charge are identified for the case of @xmath13 .",
    "in this section we also define the @xmath4 order parameters for af and sc order .    in section",
    "vi we sketch an argument that the resistivity is linear in temperature in the limit of no interactions . in the next section we consider small thermal perturbations near @xmath33 . by comparing with the specific heat of a degenerate electron gas , we argue that a small non - zero temperature can be incorporated as a coupling in the lagrangian corresponding to relativistic mass @xmath34 and we estimate the constant @xmath35 .",
    "in section viii the mean field analysis is carried out with potential competition between af and sc order . as we explain , these two phases actually do not compete in our model in this approximation . as a check of the formalism ,",
    "we reproduce some of the basic features of the bcs theory for an s - wave gap in the case of an attractive coupling in section ix . for repulsive interactions we find only af order is possible in mean field approximation and this",
    "is studied in section x. there we first argue that this phase must be anti - ferromagnetic by comparing our model with the low energy non - linear sigma model description of the heisenberg anti - ferromagnet .",
    "this gives another motivation for our model at half - filling away from the circular fermi surface , and explains how the same model can interpolate between a sc phase and an af one .",
    "we argue that the af phase terminates in a first - order phase transition .",
    "the af gap is then the solution of a transcendental equation that is analyzed in various limits .    in section xi ,",
    "orbital symmetries of momentum dependent gaps are studied in a model independent way and we explain how a d - wave gap can arise . this analysis is based on a gap equation which is derived in appendix a. in section xii we compute the 1-loop contributions to the scattering of cooper pairs and show that at low energies the d - wave channel is attractive if the number of components @xmath36 . since the theory is free for @xmath37 , this means that only the physically relevant @xmath13 case has d - wave sc .",
    "this also means that the d - wave pairing can not be studied with large @xmath12 methods .",
    "section xiii is devoted to describing our rg prescription which is specific to @xmath1 .",
    "this is necessary for a proper understanding of the phase diagram . in section xiv",
    "we present global features of the phase diagram , which is characterized by some universal geometric relations , and bears a striking resemblance to the cuprates .",
    "the sc phase terminates at a second order phase transition precisely at the low energy rg fixed point , and is thus a quantum critical point .",
    "we also estimate optimal hole doping . in section",
    "xv we present detailed numerical solutions to the af and sc d - wave gap equations at non - zero temperature .",
    "for reasonable values of the lattice spacing and universal nodal fermi velocity , we estimate @xmath38 on average for sc in lsco . in section xvi",
    "we describe the interpretation of the pseudogap within our model .",
    "although we do not give a complete and rigorous derivation of our model from lattice fermion models , in order to motivate and point out relations , we have collected some known results about the latter in appendix b.",
    "let us first ignore spin and consider a single species of fermion described by the free hamiltonian in momentum space [ e.1 ] h = ( d^d ) @xmath39 _ c _ where @xmath40 is the chemical potential , we have defined @xmath41 , and [ e.2 ] \\ { _ , c_ } = ( 2)^d ^(d ) ( -  ) at finite density and zero temperature , all states with @xmath42 are filled , where the fermi energy @xmath43 depends on the density , and at zero temperature @xmath44 .",
    "the fermi surface @xmath45 is the manifold of points @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 .",
    "we wish to consider a band of energies near @xmath43 as shown in figure [ figure1 ] for @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 be any wave - vector in such a band , and let @xmath50 denote a ray from the origin to infinity along the direction of @xmath49 .",
    "we further assume that the fermi surface is sufficiently smooth , such that @xmath51 intersects @xmath45 only once .",
    "the latter implies that @xmath49 can be _ uniquely _ expressed as [ e.3 ] = _ f ( ) + ( ) where @xmath52 is the vector from the origin to the intersection of @xmath50 with @xmath45 . whereas the two vectors @xmath49 and @xmath53 are by construction parallel , the vector @xmath54 is either parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath49 .",
    "let us fix @xmath55 to be a small vector parallel to @xmath49 , i.e. pointing radially outward , as shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "since now @xmath53 is uniquely determined by @xmath55 , we may write @xmath56 . furthermore , since the particles below the fermi surface correspond to @xmath57 , the energies near the fermi surface are approximately given by [ e.4 ] ( ) = _ f _ f ( ) where @xmath58 corresponds to above or below the fermi surface , and [ e.5 ] _",
    "f ( ) = ( ) _ _ f is the fermi velocity normal to @xmath45 .",
    "[ figure1 ]    let us now assume that the fermi surface is rotationally invariant , i.e. @xmath59 depends only on @xmath60 . in @xmath1",
    "the fermi surface @xmath45 is thus a circle .",
    "this leads to the simplification that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are independent of @xmath49 . for any @xmath49 in the band , [ e.5b ]",

    "the above is a canonical transformation , since [ e.7b ] \\ { _ , a_ } = \\ { _ , b_ } = ( 2^d ) ^(d)(-  ) after normal ordering , the hamiltonian for the particles in the band is defined to be [ e.8 ] h = _",
    "|| < ( d^d ) @xmath69 where @xmath70 is zero at zero temperature . for the remainder of this paper we mostly set @xmath71 .",
    "since we are only interested in a band of energies near the fermi surface , we have introduced a cut - off @xmath72 .",
    "the vacuum @xmath73 is defined to satisfy @xmath74 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath75 , which correctly implies that all states with @xmath76 are filled .",
    "the @xmath77 and @xmath78 thus correspond to particles and holes respectively .",
    "there is an approximation made in obtaining the above hamiltonian having to do with the density of states , and this is crucial to understanding how our expansion differs from previous works . in the rotationally invariant case , for particles above the fermi surface : [ e.9 ] d^d = ddp ( k_f + p)^d-1 where @xmath79 are angular integrals .",
    "note that due to eq .",
    "( [ e.5b ] ) , the angular integrals for @xmath49 and @xmath55 are identical . at least two approximations to the above are meaningful .",
    "the first favors low energies where one approximates @xmath80 .",
    "this is the approximation that is commonly made in the literature@xcite .",
    "one the other hand , expanding out the @xmath81 , at high energies the leading term is @xmath82 , and is the most sensitive to the short distance physics and spatial dimensionality .",
    "a possible short - coming of the first , low - energy approximation is that the high energy physics is discarded from the beginning .",
    "it can not be recovered by the rg flow to low energies since the latter is irreversible . in the physical problem we are considering ,",
    "the short - distance physics of the strong coulomb repulsion is known to be important for understanding the af phase , so it makes sense to adopt an approximation that favors high energies from the beginning and to then incorporate their effects by an rg flow to lower energies .",
    "we thus keep the most important term at short distances and set @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath84 .",
    "this is in line with the usual rg idea that it is important to fix the high - energy physics as accurately as possible , and then flow down to lower energies .",
    "finally our choice is necessary for the @xmath1 effective field theory description in the next section .",
    "however one should not conclude that every theory with a circular fermi surface can be described by a relativistic field theory .",
    "one signature of a relativistic description is a density of states that is linear in energy : @xmath85 .",
    "the above expansion around the fermi surface is thus not identical to the expansion in @xcite , where the integration over @xmath55 is taken to be normal to @xmath45 times the angular integrations , and it is assumed that @xmath86 .",
    "this leads to the choice @xmath87 , and the constant @xmath88 is absorbed into the definitions of the operators .",
    "thus in the approach followed in @xcite , although the angular integrals obviously depend on @xmath32 , the scaling analysis of the @xmath89 dependence leads to marginal 4-fermion interactions for any @xmath32 , and the resulting theory is effectively @xmath90-dimensional , or a collection of such theories , one for each angular direction .",
    "notably , it was not possible to obtain a non - fermi liquid based on 4-fermion interactions in this approach@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the approach developed in this paper there is a strong dependence on @xmath32 , as in other critical phenomena , and this will turn out to be very important . in particular , it leads to a non - fermi liquid in @xmath1 .",
    "there are other important justifications for this choice .",
    "in particular , near half - filling where the interacting lattice model can be mapped to the heisenberg anti - ferromagnet , there is known to be a relativistic description of the low energy , long wavelength limit in terms of the @xmath91 non - linear sigma model .",
    "it will be shown in section x that our choice of field theory near the circular fermi surface can be extrapolated to half - filling in that an independent derivation of it can be provided exactly at half - filling .    for general processes ,",
    "physical momentum conservation of the @xmath49 s is not equivalent to @xmath55 conservation .",
    "however , consider a zero - momentum process proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "if the @xmath49 s are all exactly on the fermi surface , then this implies @xmath93 .",
    "for even numbers of particles , since all vectors on the fermi surface have the same length , this is satisfied by pairs of particles with opposite @xmath46 .",
    "allowing now small deviations @xmath94 from the fermi surface , one has [ cons ] ( _ i _ i ) = ( _ particles _ i - _ holes _ i ) because of the particle / hole transformation for the @xmath95 s in eq .",
    "( [ e.7 ] ) , this is equivalent to overall @xmath55 conservation .",
    "note that by construction , it is not possible for the momentum of a particle and a hole to add up to zero , so in the above @xmath96-function , holes are paired with other holes , and particles with other particles . therefore , spatial translational invariance of our local field theory will ensure physical momentum conservation of the @xmath49 s for this class of processes .",
    "the important allowed processes are shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "examples of un - allowed process are shown in figure [ figure3 ] . the distinction between allowed and un - allowed processes can be made explicit by introducing an operator @xmath97 that distinguishes particles and holes : [ pso ] c a _",

    "can thus be viewed as an approximate effective theory for free particles on the lattice below half - filling .",
    "an important point is that our model is not simply a direct continuum limit of the lattice model since , without additional care , the latter does not take into account the fermi surface at finite density .",
    "for instance , whereas the hubbard model has at most an @xmath103 symmetry@xcite , our continuum model has the larger @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "furthermore , as will be explained in section x , the success of our model can be attributed to the fact that an alternative justification of it can be given right at half - filling so that it can actually interpolate between half - filling and below .     with lattice spacing @xmath104.,width=226 ]    [ figure4 ]",

    "this lorentz symmetry is @xmath111 .",

    "rather , since a small non - zero temperature amounts to a small distortion of the fermi surface , it could correspond to an additional coupling in the lagrangian .",
    "if this is correct , then it should be possible to obtain known results in the limit where the interaction is turned off .",
    "suggestive of this possibility is the fact that in natural units the leading contribution to the specific heat of a degenerate electron gas can be expressed entirely in terms of @xmath88 and @xmath298 , i.e. the dependence on the electron mass is only through the fermi velocity @xmath304 .",
    "we emphasize that this way of introducing temperature is expected to be valid for temperatures near zero , and can not replace a full - fledged finite temperature formalism at arbitrary temperatures .",
    "it will however be useful for exploring the temperature dependence of low temperature gaps in the sequel .    in euclidean space , introducing a finite temperature @xmath298",

    "since the euclidean space - time volume is @xmath311 where @xmath312 is the spatial volume , one finds [ thermal.0b ] = g_t _ t    this leads us to identify the thermal perturbation with a mass term : [ thermal.0c ] g_t = ( t)^2 ,   _ t = ^- ^+ _ ^-_^+ _ the above relation is consistent with dimensional analysis for @xmath35 a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the specific heat @xmath313 at constant volume is @xmath314 .",

    "the above dependence on @xmath317 and @xmath137 is the correct one , i.e. it is the same as for a non - relativistic degenerate electron gas near @xmath33 . repeating the standard calculation of the specific heat of the electron gas to order @xmath318 ( see for instance @xcite ) for arbitrary @xmath32 , expressing the result in terms of @xmath88 instead of the density , and requiring the result to match eq .",

    "this shift downward is entirely due to a fermionic minus sign@xcite .",
    "we hope to study this more carefully in future work .",
    "finally it is important to note that the manner in which we have introduced temperature allows , at least computationally , for phase transitions that break the continuous @xmath208 and @xmath222 symmetries in @xmath48 .",
    "the mermin - wagner result@xcite is the statement that spontaneous symmetry breaking is not possible in a @xmath336 dimensional ( space plus time ) quantum mechanical system at zero temperature because of infra - red divergences that plague the existence of goldstone bosons .",

    "we thus consider solutions with either pure sc order ( @xmath368 ) or pure magnetic order ( @xmath369 ) . to further clarify the structure of the gap equation in the sequel ,",

    "this implies that the af gap is related by symmetry to a conventional s - wave gap obtained when one flips the sign of the coupling , described in the next section .",
    "let us consider now the implications of goldstone s theorem . a non - zero vacuum expectation value in any one direction of the 5-vector @xmath374 preserves an @xmath375 subgroup of @xmath4 .",

    "it is well understood that a gap that spontaneously breaks the @xmath222 symmetry in the presence of electromagnetic gauge potential automatically has the characteristic electromagnetic properties of a superconductor , i.e. meissner effect , etc .",
    "this precursor to the higgs mechanism can be understood in the original ginzburg - landau theory@xcite . a clear explanation of this can be found in weinberg s book@xcite .",
    "we are primarily interested in positive coupling @xmath22 since this corresponds to repulsive interactions .",
    "( in the next section we describe how this should correspond to the positive @xmath378 hubbard model . )",
    "however as a check of our formalism thus far , let us consider attractive interactions , i.e. negative @xmath22 , or negative @xmath378 hubbard , which should reveal the usual s - wave sc instability of the bcs theory .",
    "as our analysis shows , symplectic fermions give a proper field theoretic description of conventional s - wave superconductivity which has not been considered before .",

    "@xmath22 , equation ( [ mean.4 ] ) then implies @xmath379 is positive .",
    "specializing to @xmath273 one should recover some of the basic features of the bcs theory .",
    "the gap equation reads [ warm ] = ( 1 + _",
    "c^4/q^2 ) as the cut - off goes to infinity , the divergence can be absorbed into the coupling by defining @xmath380 .",

    "a more complete rg prescription will be described in section xiii where 1-loop diagrams are computed .",
    "note also that positive @xmath367 is marginally relevant , i.e. @xmath367 increases as the energy is lowered . since @xmath373 has dimension two ,",
    "let us define a gap @xmath382 with units of energy .",

    "the zero temperature gap as a function of @xmath367 behaves as in figure [ figure5 ] .",

    "this is similar to the relation in the bcs theory where @xmath391 .",
    "the constant @xmath392 can be estimated numerically and shows a weak dependence on @xmath22 , as table i shows .    [",

    "the above table shows that @xmath393 depends relatively weakly on @xmath394 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath20 at optimal doping is also relatively constant @xmath395 .",
    "thus the scale of the critical temperature ( [ tcsc ] ) is set primarily by @xmath137 and @xmath21 , i.e. it is only weakly dependent on the coupling @xmath22 or the hubbard couplings by eq .",
    "( [ hubbardu ] ) ; this is the beauty of having a low energy fixed point .",
    "the scale @xmath396 is an inverse length @xmath101 , which should be on the order of the lattice spacing .    to give a rough estimate of @xmath10 ,",

    "@xmath400 , @xmath401 , from the above table , this gives @xmath38 , which is quite reasonable considering all of the order @xmath90 constants we have approximated . note that this result relies on the relatively small value of @xmath20 we found from numerical solutions of the d - wave gap equation ; a value @xmath20 of order @xmath90 would give @xmath10 higher by an order of magnitude .",
    "a useful form of the above equation for @xmath10 is [ tcev ] t_c = c_sc 650 k where @xmath101 is in @xmath402 and @xmath137 in @xmath403 , and we have set @xmath35 to its estimated value @xmath404 . for the range of @xmath393 shown in the above table , @xmath405 .",
    "the maximum @xmath10 occurs around @xmath406 .",
    "since this @xmath10 is on the high side , this is perhaps because we underestimated @xmath35 in our simplified inclusion of temperature .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath21 should instead be set by the average separation of holes . at doping @xmath407",
    "this increases @xmath101 by a factor of about @xmath408 leading to @xmath409 .",
    "the above formula gives some hints on how to increase @xmath10 : shorten the lattice spacing , increase the fermi velocity by somehow modifying the effective electron mass @xmath410 , or tuning the material to @xmath406 , which would require screening the coulomb potential at short distances .",
    "in particular @xmath10 should increase with pressure if the main effect of higher pressure is to reduce the lattice spacing .",
    "it is often suggested in the literature that the pseudogap is the key to understanding high @xmath10 since the af and sc order condense out of it , and there has been much speculation about its nature .",
    "( for a review of the experimental data see@xcite . ) in this section we briefly discuss the insights on the pseudogap furnished by our model thus far .",
    "as stressed throughout this paper , the essential ingredient is the non - fermi liquid at higher temperatures before condensation .",
    "the pseudogap is the region where the energy scales are such that this non - fermi liquid behavior is visible , i.e. there are strong correlations of the electrons described by our fields @xmath130 , but the energy is not low enough for them to condense into an af or sc ordered state .",
    "the relevant energy scale is @xmath411 of the coupling @xmath412 , thus it is natural to define a pseudogap temperature @xmath25 : [ tgp ] t_pg = = x g ( ) = @xmath413 _ c where we have used eq .",
    "( [ phase.2a ] ) . thus , as defined , @xmath25 is proportional the coupling @xmath22 and below this scale the order @xmath22 corrections are relatively large .",
    "@xmath25 corresponds to the dashed line in the figures of section xiv , and this line is seen in measurements of various properties on the underdoped side .",
    "our model predicts that the @xmath25 line runs between the top of the af gap to precisely the quantum critical point which terminates the sc phase on the overdoped side , and the experiments support this@xcite .    since the dashed line in the figures simply represents the relevant energy scale where the interactions become strong , it does not represent a phase transition .",
    "there are thus no spontaneously broken @xmath208 or @xmath222 symmetries just below @xmath25 .",
    "the field with non - zero expectation value is the @xmath414 invariant @xmath415 which by eq .",
    "( [ half.6 ] ) is related to @xmath416 .",
    "the spectrum still consists of particles and holes with charge @xmath417 , just strongly coupled .",
    "any experiment performed at energies comparable to the scale of the coupling @xmath22 is sensitive to the quantum corrections in our theory , thus there are a wide variety of probes of @xmath25 .",
    "a possible concrete manifestation of the above pseudogap scale is a dynamically generated mass @xmath191 at zero temperature , since such a mass is necessarily proportional to @xmath411 . at finite temperature",
    "this mass will typically lead to thermal suppression factors @xmath418 at low temperatures .",
    "this idea will be investigated in forthcoming work .",
    "to summarize , we have constructed a @xmath1 relativistic model with 4-fermion interactions and analyzed in detail many of its properties which revealed a striking resemblance with the known features of high @xmath10 superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "apart from the overall scale @xmath21 , the phase diagram can be calculated as a function of a single parameter @xmath394 , and gives a very good first draft of what is observed in experiments .",
    "since these features of the model were outlined in the introduction , we conclude by summarizing the main theoretical aspects that are new and responsible for the model s properties .     in the approach we have taken for expanding around a circular fermi surface",
    ", there is essentially a unique non - fermi liquid in @xmath1 for spin @xmath11 electrons .",
    "the requirements of a local , rotationally invariant quantum field theory in a sense make this theory inevitable .",
    "the rotational invariance is not in conflict with the existence of a lattice if the wavelengths at low energies are long compared with the lattice spacing , in fact it is already known that the non - linear sigma model description of the heisenberg magnet is rotationally invariant .",
    "our model has a low energy fixed point for the same reason that the @xmath274 vector models have the wilson - fisher fixed point , since the perturbative expansion differs from the latter only by some fermionic minus signs .",
    "the model is perturbatively tractable since the low energy value of the coupling is relatively small @xmath15 , even for arbitrarily strong interactions at short distances .",
    "the kind of theory considered here , namely a lorentz scalar fermion with interactions , has only recently been considered in this context@xcite because it was previously thought to be inconsistent with the spin - statistics theorem and unitarity .",
    "in fact , the free version arises as faddeev - popov ghosts in gauge theory .",
    "as explained in @xcite , since the theory turns out to be pseudo - hermitian , @xmath419 , it still defines a unitary time evolution and has real eigenvalues .",
    "the non - interacting theory is actually a perfectly hermitian description of particles and holes near the fermi surface . in this paper",
    "we further elaborated on this issue , noting that the operator @xmath97 simply distinguishes between particles and holes .",
    "furthermore , the kinematic constraints coming from the expansion around the fermi surface require eigenstates of @xmath180 that are also eigenstates of @xmath97 , and for such states @xmath180 is actually hermitian .",
    "finally , the model is consistent with spin - statistics since spin is a flavor symmetry and we are still quantizing spin @xmath11 particles as fermions .     a small non - zero temperature can be introduced as a relativistic mass term in the lagrangian .",
    "thus , in euclidean space , the theory is @xmath420 dimensional and spontaneous symmetry breaking is possible , in accordance with the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "our model gives a new quantum field theoretic treatment of conventional s - wave superconductivity for attractive interactions in @xmath277 and can be extended down to @xmath1 .",
    "the same model can be motivated from the hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "thus , the model can interpolate between the nearly circular fermi surface just below and up to half - filling .",
    "this analysis shows how to vary the hole doping by varying the cut - offs , or equivalently the inverse coupling , and leads to a calculable phase diagram .",
    "the phase diagram has some universal geometrical features that depend on the strength of the coupling at short distances . in order to properly understand the phase diagram",
    ", it was essential to recognize that hole doping was proportional to the inverse coupling and to implement certain rg scaling relations .",
    "it was necessary to derive a new kind of momentum - dependent gap equation that incorporates the scattering of cooper pairs near the fermi surface .",
    "only then can one see that there is an attractive d - wave channel even if the original interactions that led to af order were repulsive .",
    "this d - wave channel is only attractive for @xmath36 , so it can not be understood using large @xmath12 methods .",
    "although the @xmath4 symmetry helps to explain the existence of both af and sc order since order parameters for both are present , since the af gap is s - wave and the sc gap is d - wave , they are not simply related by symmetry . in particular the d - wave gap equation is second order in the coupling @xmath22 whereas the af one is first order .",
    "what is related by @xmath4 symmetry to the af phase is a conventional s - wave sc obtained when one flips the sign of the interaction to make it attractive .",
    "the pseudogap is the region where the energy scales are comparable to the scale of the dimensionfull coupling @xmath22 , but not low enough for the particles to condense .",
    "our theory certainly reproduces all of the qualitative features of high @xmath10 materials and we believe also explains the universal nodal fermi velocity observed in @xcite . on the quantitative side ,",
    "the 1-loop calculation of the optimal doping fraction is in good agreement with experimental results , as is our estimate of @xmath10 .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this article to present additional detailed comparisons with the many impressive experimental results obtained over the past 2 decades .",
    "we wish to thank seamus davis , jim sethna , kyle shen , and henry tye for discussions .",
    "this work is supported in part by the national science foundation .",
    "in order to consistently incorporate higher order scattering , one can start with the so - called 1pi effective action @xmath344 with the usual definition as the sum of 1-particle irreducible vertices@xcite . throughout this section we work in euclidean space .",
    "since we are only interested in gaps that depend on the spatial component @xmath49 of @xmath421 , one should start with a 4-particle term of the form : [ a.0 ] s_eff _ 4-particle = dt d^d _ 1 d^d _ 4   ^(4 ) ( x_1 , x_2 , x_3 , x_4 )   ^-_(x_1 ) ^-_(x_2 ) ^+_(x_3 ) ^+_(x_4 ) where all @xmath422 are at the same time : @xmath423 .",
