    "since the classic works @xcite by frank zerilli in early @xmath1 s on the particle falling in a schwarzschild geometry , a lot of research and study has been performed on this fundamental problem @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest computational calculations was made by press and his co - workers , which is now known as drpp calculation @xcite on the radiation emitted when a particle starting from rest at infinity falls into a non - spinning black hole .",
    "the collision of two black holes is , in principle , one of the most efficient mechanisms for the generation of the gravitational waves . in recent years",
    "the extreme mass ratio limit of the binary system has been a special focus of research in gravitational physics .",
    "extreme - mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) are one of the main sources of the gravitational waves for the gravitational wave detectors , such as laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite .",
    "emris are binary systems composed of a stellar compact object ( sco ) with a mass , @xmath2 in the range of @xmath3 inspiralling into a massive black hole ( mbh ) with a mass , @xmath4 in the range of @xmath5 located at the galactic center .",
    "thus , the mass ratios involved are @xmath6 . during the slow inspiral phase the system is driven by the emission of gravitational radiation ,",
    "the general features of which are now well understood .",
    "press showed that there is always an intermediate stage where the ringdown is dominated by a set of oscillating and exponentially decaying solutions , quasinormal modes ( qnms ) whose spectrum depends only on the mass of the black hole and the multipole - moment index @xmath7 of the initial perturbation @xcite .",
    "this regime is followed by a power - law _ tail _",
    "decay due to backscattering .",
    "for the emri , the small companion black hole is modeled as a point particle , and the problem can be framed by using the black hole perturbation theory . moreover , as the first approximation , the point particle follows the geodesics in the space - time of the central black hole .",
    "the frequency - domain approach to this problem has achieved many remarkable results .",
    "specifically the accurate @xmath8 determination of the energy flux of gravitational waves was obtained in the frequency - domain @xcite .",
    "however , the frequency - domain approach can take long computational time and lose accuracy for non - periodic orbits ( for example , parabolic orbits , orbits with high eccentricity or decaying orbits ) .",
    "the time - domain approach seems better suited for such orbits @xcite . for the time - domain approach , the finite - difference ( fd )",
    "method is one of the most popular numerical methods .",
    "the fd time - domain methods , however , suffer from the relatively poor accuracy at the moment @xcite unless a very high computational resolution is used .",
    "the main reason is the point particle approximation , i.e. the approximation of the singular source terms .",
    "various approaches to this issue have been attempted , including the regularizing the dirac @xmath0-function using a narrow gaussian distribution and also using more advanced discrete @xmath0-model @xcite .",
    "another approach of the emri problem is to use the spectral ( sp ) method @xcite . in our previous work",
    ", we used the spectral method to solve the inhomogeneous zerilli equation in time - domain and obtained good results .",
    "but the proper power - law decay was not observed @xcite . in early time",
    "the solution agrees with the established solution but in very late time the solution is contaminated by the small - scale oscillations .",
    "these oscillations are likely due to the artificial truncation of the computational domain .    in this work",
    ", we continue our previous research with the spectral method in order to obtain the proper power - law decay . for this",
    ", we developed the multi - domain hybrid method .",
    "the multi - domain method hybridizes the spectral method and the high - order finite - difference method . the spectral domain is also split into many sub - domains , each of which is also a spectral domain .",
    "the main advantage of the multi - domain method is that the computational costs can be significantly reduced by reducing the order of the interpolating polynomial in each sub - domain and the parallelization becomes robust .",
    "a fundamental reason for considering the multi - domain method is also to reduce the boundary effects due to the artificial truncation of the computational domain for obtaining the proper late time decay profile of the gravitational waveforms . in order to obtain the proper power - law decay",
    ", the outer boundary needs to be placed afar , in general .",
    "however , having a large size of the computational domain increases the computational costs significantly . in this work ,",
    "we add the finite - difference domain as the boundary domain .",
    "the spectral method is a global method and it is highly sensitive to the boundary effects . to prevent the `` fast '' propagation of these boundary effects , we use a local method instead as the boundary domain , such as the finite - difference domain . by doing this",
    ", we obtain the proper power - law decay while having the computational costs reduced and also exploiting the accuracy of the spectral method . to patch each sub - domain with others ,",
    "we derive the accurate and stable patching conditions . for the spectral and finite - difference sub - domains ,",
    "we show that the resolution across the interface needs to be closely uniform .",
    "otherwise , the cfl condition becomes strict .    for the singular source term",
    ", we use both the gaussian @xmath0-function method and the discrete @xmath0-function method . for the gaussian method",
    ", we change the shape of the gaussian profile to mimic the @xmath0-function . for the discrete @xmath0-function",
    ", we generalize the discrete @xmath0-function developed by sundararajan et al .",
    "@xcite into the one on the non - uniform grid .",
    "we provide numerical results that show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed hybrid method . using the hybrid method",
    "we could obtain the proper power - law decay with the gaussian approximation model .",
    "we use various shapes of the gaussian profile and found that the result is insensitive to the shape .",
    "that is , even a broad profile , which results in a smooth solution , yields the power - law decay successfully . with the smooth solution",
    ", the spectral method does not need to use the filter operation , which increases the computational efficiency further .",
    "we also obtain the power - law decay with the discrete @xmath0-function model , but the computed slope was not accurate , which may imply that the discrete @xmath0-function model yields correct results only on uniform grids .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the finite - difference and spectral methods . for the finite - difference method",
    ", we used the @xmath9th - order method . for the spectral method we use the chebyshev spectral collocation method based on the gauss - lobatto collocation points . in section 3",

    ", we discuss the stability of the hybrid method . in section 8 ,",
    "numerical results are provided . in section 9 , a brief summary and future work are explained .",
    "in this work we consider both the 2nd and 4th - order finite - difference method . the 2nd - order finite - difference method for the spatial derivatives",
    "are well known and we omit those formulae .",
    "instead we briefly explain the 4th - order finite - difference method . for the 4th - order method we will derive the formula when the grid is non - uniform .",
    "this is because , in the spectral domain , we use the gauss - lobato collocation points , which are not evenly distributed and we need the finite - difference formula for the boundary conditions in the spectral domain .",
