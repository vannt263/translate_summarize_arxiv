    "it is perturbative in the sense that it follows a genealogic generation of the wave function and that it uses ( or refers to ) pertubative estimates of the coefficients of the second generation vectors . + but it is not perturbative in the sense that the coefficients of the first generation vectors are obtained by solving a set of coupled polynomial equations . it may compared to the coupled cluster method ( and in particular to a ccd(s , t ) version ) from which it differs by the consideration of possible deviations from additivity of multiple - excitation energies and by the introduction of @xmath67 corrections in energy denominators .",
    "+ although perfectly applicable to _ ab initio _ calculations , the method has been essentially designed for the study of periodic lattices and model hamiltonians . in such cases , starting from strongly localized zero - order pictures , the method is analytical , it leads to simple polynomial expressions , introducing a very limited number of variables ( one per type of bond in most cases ) , which can be solved on a pocket calculator .",

    "it provides an elegant exploratory tool for the study of spin periodic lattices .",
    "the present work has shown that the method may be employed to identify phase transitions .",
    "the method is of course applicable to hubbard hamiltonians , whose exact solutions are not known ( except for the 1-d regular chain ) and to 2-d or 3-d lattices . since",
