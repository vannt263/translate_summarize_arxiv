    "almost all low - energy collisions of microparticles with an internal structure ( i.e. , atom - atom , nucleus - nucleus etc ) include inelastic processes such as excitations of internal degrees of freedom of colliding particles or processes with rearrangements of their constituent parts .",
    "these processes can be described by a matrix ( more precisely multichannel ) schrdinger equation with a local matrix potential @xcite .",
    "one may be interested in both direct and inverse scattering problems for this equation .",
    "the method of susy transformations is known as a powerful tool for solving both types of problems for a single - channel schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the first attempt to generalize the method for a coupled - channel schrdinger equation with different thresholds is given in @xcite .",
    "this attempt is based on a non - conservative susy transformation ( contrary to @xcite ) , i.e. a susy transformation that does not preserve a boundary behavior of solutions .",
    "the main advantage of such transformations is a possibility to obtain multichannel potentials with a non - trivial coupling starting from the zero potential .",
    "the present work is aimed at the investigation of spectral properties of these susy potentials .",
    "our approach is based on an analysis of the jost matrix . in the non - relativistic scattering theory",
    "the jost matrix plays a fundamental role similar to the scattering matrix .",
    "the zeros of the jost - matrix determinant define positions of the bound / virtual states and resonances @xcite .",
    "therefore , studying the zeros of the jost - matrix determinant allows one to analyze the spectrum of the model .",
    "a closed analytical expression of the jost matrix , as well as potential , resulting from a non - conservative susy transformation of the zero potential is obtained in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of spectral properties for such potentials was not presented up to now despite the fact that the jost matrix is well known @xcite .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the spectrum of the potential after a non - conservative susy transformation changes essentially and to find these changes one has to find all the zeros of the jost - matrix determinant .",
    "more precisely , no one spectral point of the initial hamiltonian belongs to the spectrum of the transformed hamiltonian . as a result , a supersymmetry algebra , which is always present in the case of conservative susy transformations , can not actually be constructed here and the word susy transformation is only a formal heritage from the previous conservative case @xcite .",
    "the principal point of this paper is to show that the qualitative behavior of the spectrum of ( non - conservative ) susy partners of the vanishing multichannel potential with threshold differences may be studied for an arbitrary number of channels , @xmath1 .",
    "we think this is a very strong result , since even for the case @xmath6 the full analysis of the spectrum is a very complicated problem @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this is an extremely rapid growth of the order of an algebraic equation defining the spectrum with the growth of the number of channels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with preliminaries , where we give basic definitions and equations .",
    "section [ sec : nbs ] is devoted to the analysis of the number of bound states resulting from a non - conservative susy transformation of the zero potential as a function of the parameters defining the transformation .",
    "this analysis is based on the study of the properties of the eigenvalues of the jost matrix . following similar lines we analyze the possible number of virtual states in section [ sec : vs ] .",
    "once the bound and virtual states are analyzed we can formulate conditions under which resonances may appear ; this is made in section [ sec : r ] .",
    "the behavior of the jost - matrix determinant zeros is studied in section [ sec : wc ] in the approximation of a weak coupling between channels . in section [ sec : cox ] we deal with the particular two - channel case . in this case",
    "we express parameters of the potential in terms of zeros of the jost - matrix determinant , i.e. solve an inverse spectral problem .",
    "the main results are summarized in the conclusion .",
    "let us first summarize the notations used below for coupled - channel scattering theory @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of coupled radial schrdinger equations for the @xmath7-waves that in reduced units reads @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the radial coordinate , @xmath11 is an @xmath12 real symmetric matrix , @xmath13 is the unit matrix , and @xmath14 may be either a matrix - valued or a vector - valued solution . by @xmath15",
    "we denote a point in the space @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "a diagonal matrix with non - vanishing entries @xmath19 is written as @xmath20 .",
    "the complex wave numbers @xmath19 are related to the center - of - mass energy @xmath21 and the channel thresholds @xmath22 , which are supposed to be different from each other , @xmath23 , by @xmath24 we assume here that @xmath25 and the different channels have equal reduced masses , a case to which the general situation can always be formally reduced @xcite .",
    "let us recall basic definitions from susy quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is known that the solutions of the initial schrdinger equation ( [ schr ] ) may be mapped into the solutions of the transformed equation with help of the differential - matrix operator @xmath26\\psi(k , r)\\,.\\ ] ] the transformed schrdinger equation has form ( [ schr ] ) with a new potential @xmath27 matrix @xmath28 is called superpotential @xmath29 and expressed in terms of a matrix solution @xmath30 of the initial schrdinger equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a diagonal matrix called the factorization wave number , which corresponds to an energy @xmath33 lying below all thresholds , called the factorization energy .",
    "the entries of @xmath34 , thus , satisfy @xmath35 ; by convention , we choose them positive : @xmath36 .",
    "solution @xmath30 is called the factorization solution .    in the case of the zero potential @xmath37",
    ", @xmath30 contains only exponentials @xmath38 the symmetric matrix @xmath39 is the superpotential at @xmath40 , which can be chosen arbitrary .",
    "it is convenient to introduce special notations @xmath41 for the diagonal and @xmath42 for the off - diagonal entries of @xmath39 .",
    "the jost matrix of a ( non - conservative ) susy partner of the @xmath1-channel zero potential reads @xcite @xmath43 which is also the jost matrix obtained in @xcite .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition on the parameters ( factorization energy @xmath44 and superpotential at the origin @xmath39 ) to get a potential without singularity at finite distances is obtained in @xcite .",
    "this condition is the positive definiteness of matrix @xmath45 : @xmath46 which puts some upper limit on the factorization energy @xmath44 at fixed @xmath39 .",
    "zeros of the jost - matrix determinant define positions of the bound / virtual states and the resonances .",
    "thus , to find these positions we have to solve the following equation @xmath47 taking into account the threshold conditions ( [ thre ] ) . according to ( [ ftcox ] ) , the roots of equation ( [ jdz ] )",
    "are defined by the roots of @xmath48 where @xmath49 in what follows we concentrate on the analysis of the zeros of @xmath50 only keeping in mind that some of them may be cancelled in @xmath51 if @xmath52 .",
    "our starting point is thus a system of algebraic equations ( [ bz ] ) and ( [ thre ] ) which reads , with certain coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath54    first we show that system ( [ algeq ] ) , ( [ algeqa ] ) can be reduced to an algebraic equation of the @xmath55 degree with respect to one momentum , say @xmath56 , only .",
    "indeed , any momentum enters equation ( [ algeq ] ) only linearly .",
    "therefore it can be rewritten in the form [ kn ] k_np_1(k_1, ",
    ",k_n-1)=q_1(k_1,  ,k_n-1 ) , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are polynomials of the first degree in each of the variables @xmath59 .",
    "it is important to note that given all momenta @xmath59 this equation defines @xmath60 in a unique way if @xmath61 does not vanish . on the other hand we can square the left- and right - hand sides of ( [ kn ] ) thus obtaining an equation where @xmath60 enters only in the second degree and polynomials @xmath62 and @xmath63 are polynomials of the second degree with respect to their variables .",
    "but in the equation thus obtained using threshold condition ( [ algeqa ] ) we can replace all second powers of the variables @xmath64 , @xmath65 by @xmath66 , which makes disappear both variable @xmath60 and the second power of @xmath64 , @xmath67 from the resulting equation and raises the power of @xmath56 till @xmath68 .",
    "we thus see",
    "that after these manipulations variable @xmath69 enters in the resulting equation only in the first degree and the equation can be rewritten in form ( [ kn ] ) [ kn-1 ] k_n-1p_2(k_1,  ,k_n-2)=q_2(k_1,  ,k_n-2 ) , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are polynomials of the first degree in each of the variables @xmath72 . from ( [ kn-1 ] ) ,",
    "given @xmath73 , not a zero of @xmath74 , we obtain @xmath69 in a unique way .",
    "we note that the system ( [ kn-1 ] ) , ( [ kn ] ) and ( [ algeqa ] ) where from ( [ algeqa ] ) the last equation @xmath75 should be excluded , is equivalent to the original system ( [ algeq ] ) , ( [ algeqa ] ) .",
    "it is clear that we can repeat the above process @xmath76 times more to get an equation [ k2 ] k_2p_n-1(k_1)=q_n-1(k_1 ) and finally [ k1 ] p_n(k_1)=0 with @xmath77 of order @xmath2 .",
    "note , that the subscript in @xmath78 and @xmath79 indicates nothing but the step in this procedure .",
    "it is evident that any @xmath56 which ( together with @xmath80 ) solves the system ( [ algeq ] ) , ( [ algeqa ] ) is a root of ( [ k1 ] ) .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "indeed , given a root @xmath56 of ( [ k1 ] ) , but not a root of @xmath81 , we find from ( [ k2 ] ) a unique @xmath82 .",
    "once we know @xmath56 and @xmath82 we find @xmath83 from equation previous to ( [ k2 ] ) and so on till @xmath60 which is found from ( [ kn ] ) .",
    "it is also clear that in this way we can get @xmath2 number of sets @xmath84 ( some of them may coincide ) each of which solves the system ( [ algeq ] ) , ( [ algeqa ] ) so that the same number @xmath2 is the number of possible solutions of this system and the system ( [ k1 ] ) , ( [ k2 ] ) ,  , ( [ kn ] ) is equivalent to the initial system ( [ algeq ] ) , ( [ algeqa ] ) .",
    "in the following , except for sections [ sec : wc ] and [ sec : cox ] , we will consider all quantities as functions of the momentum @xmath56 .",
    "other momenta are expressed in terms of @xmath56 from the threshold conditions ( [ thre ] ) . since in this section",
    "we are interested in the number of bound states we will consider only the negative energy semi - axis @xmath85 .",
    "it happens to be useful to change variables @xmath64 in favor of @xmath86 as @xmath87 and rewrite the threshold conditions ( [ algeqa ] ) accordingly @xmath88 where we have chosen only the positive value of the square root since in this section we analyze only the point spectrum of @xmath89 , which restricts all momenta @xmath64 to be purely imaginary with a positive imaginary part so that @xmath90 .    from ( [ ftcox ] )",
    "it is clear that all the zeros of @xmath91 are at the same time the zeros of the determinant of matrix @xmath92 ( [ bm ] ) and vice versa .",
    "this follows from ( [ bz ] ) and the positive definiteness of matrix @xmath93 in the momenta region we consider so that neither of the roots of @xmath94 solves the equation @xmath95 .    since @xmath96 where @xmath97 are the eigenvalues of @xmath92 , @xmath98",
    "the equation @xmath99 is equivalent to @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "matrix @xmath92 is symmetric with real entries in the momenta region we consider , @xmath102 , which implies the reality of both @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "here we introduced a diagonal matrix @xmath105 .",
    "another property of @xmath103 important for the analysis is their monotony as functions of @xmath106 that we prove below .    for",
    "a fixed @xmath107 let us consider a deviation of @xmath108 for a small increment of argument @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath109 assuming @xmath110 real , positive definite ( since @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) and infinitesimal . from ( [ es ] )",
    "one gets @xmath113 here according to ( [ bm ] ) @xmath114 and the increment of @xmath115 is just @xmath116 which plays the role of a small perturbation of @xmath115 .",
    "therefore we may calculate the shifting of the eigenvalues produced by such a perturbation using a ( rayleigh - schrdinger @xmath117 ) perturbation theory .",
    "thus , for a non - degenerate eigenvalue @xmath97 the first order correction reads @xmath118 where the inequality follows from the positive definiteness of @xmath119 , which in turn implies monotony of the eigenvalues as functions of the momenta @xmath106 . for a degenerate eigenvalue corrections",
    "are obtained by diagonalizing the same perturbation operator @xmath120 restricted to a linear span of unperturbed eigenvectors corresponding to a given eigenvalue , which still leads to positive corrections because of positive definiteness of @xmath120 .    from here",
    "it follows that any eigenvalue @xmath103 may vanish i.e. change its sign , only once .",
    "moreover , @xmath121 as @xmath122 .",
    "hence , the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath92 at @xmath123 , i.e. at the energy of the lowest threshold , is just the number of bound states .",
    "thus , to count the number of the bound states , @xmath124 , one has to consider the eigenvalues @xmath103 , @xmath125 of matrix @xmath115 at @xmath123 , @xmath126 so that @xmath127 to clarify this formula we notice that in the absence of bound states all @xmath128 , @xmath129 so that @xmath130 .",
    "every bound state is responsible for the change of the sign of only one eigenvalue from positive to negative thus raising @xmath131 by @xmath132 units , i.e. @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "this justifies the factor @xmath135 in ( [ nb ] ) .",
    "summarizing , we see that the number of bound states is bounded by @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ figev ] shows the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath92 as functions of @xmath136 for the case @xmath137 .",
    "two eigenvalues cross the axis which corresponds to the case of @xmath138 .",
    "the last comment in this section is devoted to equation ( [ posu ] ) .",
    "now it can be seen that the factorization energy should be chosen lower than the ground - state energy for the transformed potential , @xmath139 , if any .",
    "according to the definition of a virtual state @xcite in this section we will need to consider the channel wave numbers @xmath64 lying both in the positive and the negative imaginary semi - axes of the corresponding momenta complex planes and consider the full imaginary axis for @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath140 . the other momenta , @xmath80 , belong to either the positive or to negative parts of their imaginary axes in agreement with the threshold conditions @xmath141    since in ( [ kjv ] ) all combinations of signs are now possible it is convenient to introduce special notations for these combinations .",
    "denote @xmath142 a string of @xmath1 signs with @xmath143 being its @xmath144-th entry , which corresponds to the sign in ( [ kjv ] ) for the @xmath144-th momentum for @xmath145 .",
    "the first symbol `` @xmath146 '' in @xmath147 indicates that all momenta @xmath86 are expressed in terms of @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath148 and @xmath149 be the numbers of `` @xmath146 '' and `` @xmath150 '' signs in this string .",
    "we notice the following evident combinatoric properties of @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "first , @xmath153 which implies @xmath154=n2^{n-1}\\,.\\ ] ] here and in what follows the summation over @xmath155 includes all @xmath156 possible sign combinations .",
    "next , a symmetry between `` @xmath146 '' and `` @xmath150 '' leads to the following relation @xmath157    according to ( [ bm ] ) every sign combination leads to its own @xmath92 matrix defined by the corresponding @xmath158 matrix so that both @xmath158 and @xmath92 should carry an additional information about this combination",
    ". therefore @xmath159 and we denote @xmath160 , @xmath101 the eigenvalues of @xmath161 .    in order to find the zeros of the jost - matrix determinant corresponding to the virtual states we should find the purely real solutions of the equations @xmath162 , @xmath101 for all @xmath156 matrices @xmath161 . although the @xmath163 s are real , but bearing in mind our replacement @xmath87 , throughout the text we call these zeros purely imaginary .",
    "finally we note that since matrix @xmath93 in ( [ ftcox ] ) is not positive definite for an arbitrary @xmath147 anymore , in some particular cases some of the zeros of @xmath92 may be cancelled by the zeros of @xmath164 and will not correspond to virtual states . nevertheless ,",
    "omitting these particular cases , we will concentrate on an analysis of the zeros of @xmath165 only .",
    "eigenvalues @xmath160 are monotonous functions of @xmath136 in two cases only : ( i ) @xmath166 and @xmath167 ; ( ii ) @xmath168 and @xmath169 . in general",
    ", an eigenvalue @xmath170 may have minima / maxima for @xmath171 which may lead to two or even more roots in equation @xmath172 .",
    "we illustrate this behavior for @xmath137 in figure  [ fig4planes ] .",
    "the monotonous lines in the right / left part of figure  [ fig4planes](a)/(c ) .",
    "correspond to case ( i)/(ii ) .",
    "the position of the zeros of the eigenvalues is shown by stars , squares and circles .",
    "it is clearly seen that the total number of the roots of all equations @xmath172 is @xmath173 which all correspond to virtual states .",
    "a change of parameters may result in shifting the position of the virtual states only without changing the number of zeros ( i.e. virtual states ) .",
    "for instance , in the simplest case we may shift all diagonal entries of @xmath39 by a number @xmath174 , @xmath175 , thus shifting all eigenvalues of @xmath92 by the same number , @xmath176 .",
    "let us consider a specific eigenvalue defined by a string @xmath177 , with a local maximum at @xmath178 , @xmath179 .",
    "one can always shift all the eigenvalues by the value @xmath180 such that the curve @xmath181 touches the @xmath106 axis at the point @xmath182 meaning that @xmath183 not only becomes a root of the equation @xmath184 but this root is multiple ( of multiplicity 2 ) and by a small additional change of other parameters it can be split into two simple but complex roots .",
    "this is just in this way two virtual states collapse producing a resonance ; a subject which deserves a special discussion ( see the next section ) .",
    "pairs of virtual states which may collapse are shown in figure  [ fig4planes ] by squares and circles .",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that for any given @xmath185 the situation when all the zeros of the jost - matrix determinant are purely imaginary may be realized by a proper choice of @xmath41 . to see that let us consider the asymptotic behavior of @xmath186 for @xmath187 , when all off - diagonal entries of @xmath92 become negligibly small , @xmath188 and @xmath189 determine the corresponding numbers of increasing and decreasing eigenvalues at positive infinity .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath190 increases both at negative and positive infinity . now",
    "if we choose all @xmath191 sufficiently large in absolute values and negative we can always guaranty the location of a root of the equation @xmath192 near the point @xmath193 and at the same time the location of two roots of the equation @xmath172 with corresponding @xmath194 near the points @xmath195 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath147 we can obtain @xmath196 zeros .",
    "the total number @xmath197 of these zeros may be calculated by formulas ( [ summ ] ) and ( [ sympm ] ) @xmath198=n2^{n-1}\\,,\\ ] ] which coincides with the total number of all possible roots of the system ( [ algeq ] ) , ( [ algeqa ] ) and is just the maximal possible number of virtual states .",
    "hence , in this case all the roots are purely imaginary . in the next section we consider the case",
    "when some of the zeros may merge , become complex and produce resonances .",
    "for simplicity independently on whether or not it can be seen in a scattering we call any pair of complex zeros @xmath199 of the jost - matrix determinant a resonance keeping in mind that to be really visible in a scattering a resonance behavior of the corresponding cross - section should be narrow and sharp enough .",
    "conservation of the number of zeros of an @xmath200-th order algebraic equation under a variation of parameters included in its coefficients , which keeps unchanged its order ( in our case this is equation ( [ k1 ] ) obtained from the system ( [ algeq ] ) , ( [ algeqa ] ) ) applied to our case leads to the following relation @xmath201 , where @xmath124 , @xmath197 and @xmath202 are number of bound states , virtual states and resonances respectively .",
    "the aim of this section is to establish the maximal number of possible resonances accepted by a non - conservative susy - partner of the vanishing potential .",
    "evidently , the maximal number of resonances corresponds to the minimal number of bound @xmath124 and virtual @xmath197 states .",
    "these numbers would both become zero if no one of the @xmath92 matrix eigenvalues intersected the @xmath106 axis .",
    "but as it was noticed in the previous section there always exists an eigenvalue @xmath203 with the asymptotic behavior given in ( [ asymb ] ) , i.e. ranging from @xmath204 to @xmath205 and , hence , it intersects @xmath106 axis always and for all possible values of @xmath155 .",
    "we thus see that the minimal number of real zeros that all eigenvalues may take is achieved if all eigenvalues @xmath160 , @xmath145 are nodeless and curves @xmath206 intersect @xmath106 axis only once for every given sign combination @xmath155 . to realize this case , we should choose parameters included in @xmath39 in a such way that the global minimum @xmath207 of every eigenvalue @xmath160 with @xmath194 ( they tend to @xmath205 when @xmath208 ) be positive @xmath209 and , respectively , global maximum @xmath210 of every eigenvalue @xmath160 with @xmath211 ( they tend to @xmath204 when @xmath208 ) be negative @xmath212 .",
    "under these conditions only eigenvalues @xmath206 have zeros .",
    "the possibility that these eigenvalues have only one zero can always be realized .",
    "this can be demonstrated for small enough values of @xmath213 ( so called weak coupling approximation , see the next section ) which in the limit @xmath214 for all @xmath215 gives a very simple behavior of the eigenvalues . for instance , for @xmath216 large enough and @xmath217 the straight line",
    "@xmath218 never intersects with the hyperbolas @xmath219 so that small perturbations coming from small non - zero @xmath42-values ( in a physical terminology these perturbations shift the zero width resonances from the real energy axis to the complex plane ) do not change the monotonous behavior of @xmath218 and , hence , do not bring additional roots to the equation @xmath220 .",
    "thus , we see that the minimal value of virtual states with the absence of bound states is equal to all possible sign combinations of @xmath155 which is @xmath221 . hence , the maximal possible number of resonances is obtained by subtracting this number from the total number of solutions , i.e. @xmath222",
    "for the number of channels @xmath223 there is no way to get analytical solutions of system ( [ algeq ] ) , ( [ algeqa ] ) but if the coupling parameters @xmath213 are small enough assuming analyticity of the roots of the jost - matrix determinant as functions of @xmath213 a perturbation technique may be developed . in this section",
    "we demonstrate this possibility by obtaining first order corrections to unperturbed values of the roots of the jost - matrix determinant corresponding to @xmath214 .",
    "for the zero coupling , matrix @xmath39 becomes diagonal @xmath224 and the system ( [ jdz ] ) , ( [ thre ] ) reduces to @xmath225 where the additional subscript @xmath226 corresponds to the uncoupled case .",
    "its solutions have the form @xmath227 where @xmath228 .",
    "let us explicitly indicate the meaning of sub- and superscripts in ( [ solf ] ) : the second subscript @xmath229 in @xmath230 corresponds to the channel , the first superscript @xmath144 indicates a row number in ( [ solf ] ) and @xmath147 indicates one of all @xmath156 combinations of signs .",
    "thus , we see once again that the total number of solutions of the system is @xmath2 and it does not depend on whether or not the coupling is absent . note that every energy level @xmath231 corresponding to a row in ( [ solf ] ) is @xmath156 fold degenerate .",
    "below we show that under a small coupling every degenerate level @xmath232 splits by @xmath156 sub - levels and we will find approximate values of the splitting .",
    "but the unperturbed @xmath144-th momentum corresponding to this level simply equals @xmath233 .",
    "therefore , instead of our previous convention to express all quantities in terms of @xmath56 , it is convenient here to express corrections to the @xmath144-th momentum produced by a perturbation in terms of unperturbed @xmath144-th momentum @xmath234 .",
    "this is always possible due to the fact that all momenta have equal rights .",
    "but now we have to change our signs convention introduced in section [ sec : vs ] where the first momentum @xmath136 entered in the string @xmath155 always with the positive sign ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "now we have @xmath144-th momentum @xmath236 and @xmath194 in string @xmath155 .    from ( [ solf ] )",
    "we learn that no coupling implies no finite - width resonances but as we discuss below the zeros lying above the first threshold may be associated with zero - width resonances which acquire a non - zero width under a small coupling .    from the first row of ( [ solf ] )",
    "we conclude that the corresponding @xmath156 zeros with @xmath237 are always below the first threshold ( bound or virtual states ) .",
    "energy @xmath238 , @xmath239 , may be positive with respect to the first threshold and just these @xmath240 zeros are associated with the zero - width resonances . according to our convention a resonance corresponds to a pair of complex zeros .",
    "here we can easily compute the number of the zero - width resonances , @xmath241 , which is @xmath242 which agrees with the maximal number of possible resonances obtained in the previous section .",
    "unperturbed @xmath243 matrix we denote @xmath244 is diagonal @xmath245 and its eigenvalues @xmath246 coincide with its diagonal entries @xmath247    for simplicity we assume all coupling parameters @xmath213 proportional to the same small parameter @xmath248 so that the perturbed @xmath243 matrix reads b^=b_0^+ , = ||b_jl||,b_jj=0 , j=1,  ,n .",
    "now as it was mentioned above assuming analyticity of eigenvalues of this matrix as functions of @xmath248 we can develop them in a taylor series with respect to @xmath248 , @xmath249 where the first subscript number is just the power of @xmath248 .",
    "first we notice that the perturbation @xmath250 has zero diagonal entries which results in @xmath251 .",
