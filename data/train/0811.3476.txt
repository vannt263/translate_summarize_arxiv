    "reliability in communication has always been a major concern when dealing with digital data . especially in today",
    "s information - dependent society , it is vital to design efficient ways of preventing data corruption when transmitting information . error correcting codes have been developed for this purpose since the birth of the information theory field following the work of shannon @xcite .    in 1989",
    ", sourlas derived a set of error correcting codes , the so called sourlas codes , which theoretically saturate the shannon bound @xcite .",
    "although these codes turned out to be impractical , the main point of interest of this paper was the parallel made between physical spin glass systems and information theory .",
    "following this paper , the tools of statistical mechanics have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems of information theory in recent years . in the field of error correcting codes itself @xcite , as well as in spreading codes @xcite , and compression codes @xcite ,",
    "statistical mechanical techniques have shown great potential .",
    "the present paper uses similar techniques to investigate an error correcting code scheme where the codeword is encoded using tree - like multilayer perceptron neural networks .",
    "it is known that there exists a natural duality between lossy compression codes and error correcting codes .",
    "indeed , a lossy compression code can be regarded as a standard error correcting code , but one where the codeword is generated using the original decoder of the error correcting code scheme and where the decompressed message is obtained using the original encoder of the scheme ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "recently , a lossy compression scheme based on a simple perceptron decoder was investigated by hosaka et al .",
    "@xcite . in their paper , they used statistical mechanical techniques to investigate the theoretical performance of their scheme at the infinite codeword length limit .",
    "the perceptron they defined in their model uses a special hat - shaped non - monotonic transfer function .",
    "this rather uncommon feature enables the scheme to deal with biased messages and it is known that this type of function maximizes the storage capacity of the simple perceptron @xcite .",
    "they found that their scheme can theoretically yield shannon optimal performance .",
    "subsequently , shinzato et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the same model but in the framework of error correcting code . they found that their model can theoretically yield shannon optimal performance .    based on these studies , mimura et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a tree - like multilayer perceptron network for lossy compression purposes , but use only the standard sign function as the transfer function of their model .",
    "they showed that the parity tree model can theoretically yield shannon optimal performance , but only when considering unbiased messages .",
    "in contrast , they showed that the committee tree model can not yield optimal performance , even for unbiased messages .",
    "however , the advantage of using a multilayer structure is improved replica symmetric solution stability , and an increased number of codewords sharing the same distortion properties @xcite . in a recent study ,",
    "cousseau et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the same tree - like multilayer perceptron model but used the hat - shaped non - monotonic transfer function introduced by hosaka et al .",
    "@xcite , thus combining both advantages of @xcite . by doing so , they were able to show that both parity tree and committee tree structures can then theoretically yield shannon optimal performance even for biased messages under some specific conditions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss the performance of the same tree - like perceptron models but in the error correcting code framework , thus completing the topic of perceptron type network applications in coding theory . in this paper",
    ", we make use of the binary asymmetric channel ( bac ) . indeed , the use of the non - monotonic hat - shaped transfer function introduced by hosaka et al .",
    "@xcite enables us to control the bias of the of the codeword sequence , and enables the relevant schemes to deal with such an asymmetric channel ( the bac was also used by shinzato et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", we expect the schemes which use the standard monotonic sign function to be able to deal only with the bsc channel , which corresponds to a particular case of the bac .",
    "the majority of popular error correcting codes like turbo codes @xcite and low density parity check codes ( ldpc ) @xcite , which provide near shannon performance in practical time frames , have been widely studied but this was generally restricted to symmetric channels . on the other hand ,",
    "apart from a few studies @xcite , little is known when dealing with asymmetric channels .",
    "multilayer perceptrons have been widely studied over the years by the machine learning community and a wide range of problems have been considered ( storage capacity , learning rules , etc ) .",
    "these works revealed non - trivial behaviors of even simple models like the simple perceptron network for example .",
    "many of these previous results are summarized in reference @xcite .",
    "the present analysis gives us an opportunity to discuss the difficulty of decoding for densely connected systems ( or dense systems as opposed to sparsely connected systems like ldpc codes for example ) using a systematic manner in the context of multilayer networks .",
    "there has been relatively little discussion of dense systems , mainly because of the computational cost which is obviously higher than for sparse systems .",
    "however , because of their their rich randomness , dense systems can possibly be regarded as pseudo - random codes like the dense limit of ldpc codes .",
    "in this paper we mainly focus on the necessary conditions to get shannon optimal performance . to discuss practical decoders , it is first necessary to investigate the optimality of our schemes .",
    "this includes discussion of the optimal parameters for the transfer function since we need to know these parameters to discuss the optimal decoder . in other words ,",
    "we need a theoretical analysis of the performance before we can study the decoding problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section2 ] introduces the framework of error correcting codes .",
    "section [ section3 ] describes our model .",
    "section [ section4 ] deals with the bac capacity .",
    "section [ section5 ] presents the mathematical tools used to evaluate the performance of the present scheme .",
    "section [ section6 ] states the results and elucidates the location of the phase transition , which characterizes the best achievable performance of the model .",
    "section [ section7 ] is devoted to the conclusion and discussion .",
    "in a general scheme , an original message @xmath0 of size @xmath2 is encoded into a codeword @xmath1 of size @xmath3 by some encoding device .",
    "the aim of this stage is to add redundancy to the original data .",
    "therefore , we necessarily have @xmath4 . based on this redundancy , a proper decoder device should be able to recover the original data even if it were corrupted by noise in the transmission channel .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 is called the code rate and evaluates the trade - off between redundancy and codeword size . the codeword @xmath1 is then fed into a channel where the bits are subject to noise .",
    "the received noisy message @xmath6 ( which is also @xmath3 dimensional ) is then decoded using its redundancy to infer the original @xmath2 dimensional message @xmath0 . in other words , in a bayesian framework , one tries to maximize the following posterior probability , @xmath7    as data transmission is costly , generally one wants to be able to ensure error - free transmission while transmitting the fewest possible bits . in other words ,",
    "one wants to ensure error - free transmission while keeping the code rate as large as possible . for this purpose ,",
    "the well known shannon bound @xcite gives a way to compute the best achievable code rate which allows error - free recovery . however , while this gives us the value of such an optimal code rate , it does not give any clue as to how to construct such an optimal code .",
    "therefore , several codes have been proposed over the years in an ongoing quest to find a code which can reach this theoretical bound .",
    "in this paper , since we make use of techniques derived from statistical mechanics , we will use ising variables rather than boolean ones .",
    "the boolean @xmath8 is mapped onto @xmath9 in the ising framework while the boolean @xmath9 is mapped to @xmath10 .",
    "this mapping can be used without any loss of generality .",
    "we assume that the original message @xmath11 is generated from the uniform distribution and that all the bits are independently generated so that we have @xmath12 the channel considered in this study is the binary asymmetric channel ( bac ) where each bit is flipped independently of the others with asymmetric probabilities .",
    "if the original bit fed into the channel is @xmath9 , then it is flipped with probability @xmath13 .",
    "conversely , if the original bit is @xmath10 , it is flipped with probability @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig : bac ] shows the bac properties in details .",
    "the well known binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) corresponds to the particular case @xmath15 .    when the corrupted message @xmath6 is received at the output of the channel , the goal is then to recover @xmath0 using @xmath6 .",
    "the state of the estimated message is denoted by the vector @xmath16 .",
    "the general outline of the scheme is shown in figure [ fig : scheme ] .        from figure",

    ", @xmath29 is a non - monotonic function of a real parameter @xmath30 of the form @xmath31 and the vectors @xmath32 are fixed @xmath33-dimensional independent vectors uniformly distributed on @xmath34 . the use of random input vectors is known to maximize the storage capacity of perceptron networks , making such a scheme promising for error correcting tasks .",
    "the @xmath35 function denotes the sign function taking @xmath9 for @xmath36 and @xmath10 for @xmath37 .",
    "each of these architectures applies a different non - linear transformation to the original data @xmath0 .",

    "note that we can also consider an encoder based on a committee - tree where both the hidden - units and the output unit are non - monotonic .",
    "however , this introduces an extra parameter ( we will have one threshold parameter for the hidden - units and one for the output unit ) to tune and the performance should not change drastically . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our study to the above three cases .    to keep the notation as general as possible , as long as explicit use of the encoder is not necessary in computations",
    ", we will denote the transformation performed on vector @xmath16 by the respective encoders using the following notation : @xmath38 @xmath39 takes a different expression for the five different types of network and @xmath30 denotes the fact that all the encoders depend on a real threshold parameter @xmath30 ( except for schemes ( iv ) and ( v ) , where this function does not depend on @xmath30 .",
    "however for consistency , we will keep this notation for these schemes ) .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath39 contains all the terms depending on index @xmath40 ( i.e. : @xmath41 contains all the terms @xmath42 ) .",
    "in this section , we compute the capacity of the bac . according to shannon s channel coding theorem ,",
    "the optimal code rate is given by the capacity of the channel .",
    "any code rate bigger than the channel capacity will inevitably lead to information loss .",
    "the definition of the channel capacity @xmath43 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes mutual information , @xmath46 denotes the channel input distribution , and @xmath47 denotes the channel output distribution .",
    "computation of the capacity of such a binary channel requires only simple algebra and calculations are straightforward , giving @xmath48 where @xmath49 , \\\\ \\delta_c & = & \\left [ \\frac { r^r ( 1-r)^{1-r } } { p^p ( 1-p)^{1-p } } \\right]^{1/1-r - p } , \\\\ \\omega_c & = & \\frac { 2 \\gamma_c - 1 -r + p } { 1 -r -p}. \\label{omegc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the special case @xmath15 , the capacity simplifies to @xmath50 which corresponds to the capacity of the bsc .",
    "as stated in section ii , our goal is to maximize the posterior @xmath51 .",
    "let us define the following hamiltonian : @xmath52   = - \\ln p({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ y$}},{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ s$}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ground state of the above hamiltonian trivially corresponds to the _ maximum a posteriori _ ( map ) estimator of the posterior @xmath51 .",
    "then , let us compute the joint probability of @xmath6 and @xmath16 .",
    "we have @xmath53 since the relation between an arbitrary message @xmath16 and the codeword fed into the channel is deterministic , for any @xmath16 , we can write @xmath54 \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we finally get the explicit expression of the hamiltonian , @xmath55 \\right\\ } \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this hamiltonian , we can define the following partition function @xmath56 , \\ ] ] where the sum over @xmath16 represents the sum over all possible states for vector @xmath16 , and @xmath57 is the inverse temperature parameter . such a partition function can be identified with the partition function of a spin glass system with dynamical variables @xmath16 and quenched variables @xmath58 .",
    "the average of this partition function over @xmath6 and @xmath58 naturally contains all the interesting typical properties of the scheme , such as the free energy .",
    "however , it is hard to evaluate this average and we need some techniques to investigate it . in this paper , we use the so - called _ replica method _ to calculate the average of the partition function .",
    "once the free energy is obtained , one can compute the critical code rate at which a phase transition occurs between the ferromagnetic phase ( error recovery possible ) and the paramagnetic phase ( decoding impossible ) .",
    "this gives us the best code rate the scheme can achieve .",
    "a code rate exceeding this critical value will make decoding impossible .",

    "indeed , we confirmed that the standard monotonic parity tree saturates the shannon bound only in the case of the bsc channel .",
    "the standard monotonic committee tree however , fails to provide optimal performance even in the bsc case .    as a general conclusion",
    ", this paper shows that tree - like multilayer perceptrons introduced in @xcite within the framework of lossy compression can also be used efficiently in an error correcting code scheme . for each network considered , we provided a theoretical analysis of the typical performance and gave the necessary conditions for obtaining optimal performance . in each case , we were able to derive results similar to the lossy compression results .",

    "this paper discusses only the typical performance of the schemes at the infinite codeword length , however , and does not provide any explicit decoder . because the present schemes make use of densely connected systems , a formal decoder can not be implemented as it would require a decoding time which would grow exponentially with the size of the original message .",
    "one promising alternative is to use the popular belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm to calculate an approximation of the marginalized posterior probabilities .",
    "the bp algorithm is known for giving good results when working in the ferromagnetic phase , where no frustration is present into the system .    with the previous work done on lossy compression @xcite and on error correcting code @xcite using perceptron type networks",
