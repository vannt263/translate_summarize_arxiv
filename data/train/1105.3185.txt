    "the past decade has been witness to a highly productive back - and - forth relationship between x - ray and radio studies of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "their nonthermal radio emissions , serving as tracers of particle acceleration , have motivated follow - up x - ray observations , most notably with the _ chandra_telescope . in many instances ,",
    "x - ray imaging has revealed point - like sources surrounded by extended synchrotron structures , typically axisymmetric ; these pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) arise from the shocked outflows of relativistic particle winds driven by a central engine , the powerful time - varying fields in a neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "targeted radio periodicity searches of pwne have then uncovered previously unseen pulsations , providing the spin periods and , eventually , estimated ages , magnetic field strengths , and spin - down luminosities of the neutron stars , without which a meaningful physical understanding of the surrounding phenomena would be beyond reach .",
    "a few specific examples of this general picture of radio / x - ray symbiosis have been the discoveries of the pulsars in the remnants 3c58 , g54.1 + 0.3 , g292.0 + 1.8 , and in the `` mouse '' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the crab nebula has been viewed for decades as a prototype , but there is growing evidence of pwne with substantially different properties .",
    "at least three objects , among them the vela snr , have nonthermal radio spectra that are steep in comparison to the crab ( i.e. , with spectral indices @xmath10 , where flux @xmath11 at frequency @xmath12 ) and morphologies characterized by radio emission lobes straddling a central depression . while the nature of one such candidate pwn , da  495 , was once in question , x - ray imaging observations led to the discovery of an x - ray nebula and a presumed neutron star , both residing near the radio `` hole '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , asl+08 ) .",
    "radio and x - ray pulsation searches have not , however , detected a pulsar signature , so a key ingredient is lacking from our understanding of da  495 . in this paper",
    ", we describe a similar series of observations directed toward understanding the third member of this group of unusual snrs , g76.9@xmath01.0 .",

    "motivated by the _ chandra _  discovery of the point source and possible pwn at the heart of snr g76.9@xmath01.0 , we searched for radio pulsations with the gbt .",
    "the spectrometer spigot data - acquisition backend @xcite was used for 5 hours on each of two days , with 600 mhz of useful bandwidth centered at 1.95 ghz .",

    "the difference in the pulse periods derived at these epochs gave the first indication of the pulsar s spin - down rate and thence its canonical age , magnetic field strength , and spin - down power ( see below ) .",
    "a search for single `` giant '' pulses yielded no compelling candidates , despite the fact that the pulsar s estimated magnetic field strength at the light cylinder , suggested to be relevant in the production of giant pulses @xcite , is approximately 70% that of both the crab pulsar and psr  b1937 + 21 , and comparable to that of psr  b1821@xmath4624 , all of which exhibit giant pulses .",

    "notably , the pulse periods measured during and after the confirmation observation differed substantially from those detected during the two discovery observations made 1.5 years earlier , implying that a spin `` glitch '' of magnitude @xmath47 had occurred at an unknown epoch in this interval .",
    "the spacing of the radio timing observations together with apparent `` timing noise '' instability in the pulsar s rotation on similar timescales precluded derivation of a phase - connected timing solution .",
    "we therefore determined the long - term average spin - down rate , @xmath48 , through a least - squares fit to the multi - epoch period measurements ( figure  [ fig : radiotiming ] ) , a result consistent with the short - term x - ray - derived ephemeris shown in table  [ tab : ephem ] ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "the pulsar s flux density at 2 ghz , @xmath49 , is 60  @xmath44jy ; its 4.8  ghz flux density of @xmath50  @xmath44jy suggests that psr  j2022@xmath03842has an unusually flat spectrum , @xmath51 .",
    "the implied radio pseudo - luminosity @xmath52  mjy  kpc@xmath53 is unremarkable , low in comparison to the majority of known pulsars , but an order of magnitude higher than the luminosities of other young , faint pulsars discovered in deep searches of snrs @xcite . even with a long cumulative exposure , our best average pulse profile ( figure  [ fig : radiotiming ] ) retains significant statistical noise ; despite this faintness , a number of relevant pulse shape and polarization results are available .",
    "the radio pulsations of psr  j2022@xmath03842  are significantly affected by dispersion and scattering due to propagation in the interstellar medium , which are typically important at frequencies @xmath54  ghz , even in our 2  ghz observations . to estimate dispersion measure ( dm ) and the pulse broadening timescale @xmath55 , we formed a pulse - shape model assuming a gaussian - shaped intrinsic profile , a one - sided exponential - decay impulse response function for the scatter - broadening , and a @xmath56 frequency dependence for the width of the exponential .",
    "we fit the s - band ( i.e. , 2ghz ) data to this model in four evenly - spaced frequency sub - bands , allowing the width of the intrinsic gaussian profile to vary and also accounting for a dm bias caused by the frequency - dependent pulse broadening due to scattering .",
    "this simple model fit the data well , but we caution that the assumptions inherent in the model may introduce significant systematic errors , perhaps as large as twice the statistical uncertainties quoted below . the ne2001 galactic electron distribution model @xcite fails to accommodate the derived @xmath57  pc  @xmath58 in the direction of psr  j2022@xmath03842formally , the model suggests a lower bound on the distance to the pulsar of 50 kpc . instead , a likely over - density of free electrons in the cygnus region , along the line of sight , accounts for the higher - than - expected dispersion ",
    "a similar explanation has been advanced for the unexpectedly large dm of the nearby psr j2021 + 3651 @xcite .    in this direction ,",
    "the perseus arm lies at a distance of approximately 6  kpc , and the outer arm at @xmath59 kpc . for convenience in scaling distance - dependent parameters and because the larger distance brings x - ray efficiencies more approximately in line with those of other young pulsars ( see   [ sec : discuss ] ) , we adopt a distance @xmath60  kpc .",
    "independent supporting evidence for the large distance derives from hi absorption and x - ray studies of the pwn ctb 87 @xcite , roughly @xmath61 from g76.9@xmath01.0  on the sky . at a distance of 6.1 kpc ,",
    "ctb 87 lies in the perseus arm and its x - ray - derived absorbing column is @xmath62  @xmath6 at 90% confidence ( safi - harb , matheson & kothes , in preparation ) ; although their uncertainties are large , the nominal hi column for g76.9@xmath01.0  is somewhat larger than that for ctb 87 .",
    "a radio bright extragalactic point source adjacent to ctb 87 exhibits a deep absorption component at a velocity of about @xmath63  km  s@xmath2 not seen in the absorption profile of ctb 87 .",
    "this feature could account for the larger foreground absorption toward g76.9@xmath01.0   if the latter is located at a significantly larger distance , such as the outer arm or beyond it .",
    "the ne2001 model also predicts a timescale for pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering of 0.3 ms at 1 ghz ; instead , we find @xmath64  ms , which scales to @xmath65  ms at the center of our observing band but varies strongly across it .",
    "the long decay of the pulse , here averaged over the 700 mhz band , can be seen in the upper half of figure  [ fig : radiotiming ] .",
    "consistent with this result , an exploratory observation centered at 800 mhz sky frequency failed to detect the pulsar ; similar attempts at 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz yielded weak detections . at 5 ghz ,",
    "the pulse was unexpectedly broad , consistent with the results of the frequency - subband fit to the pulse shape .",
    "thus , in addition to the importance of scatter - broadening at the lower frequencies , the pulse appears to be intrinsically broad , roughly 30% of the pulse period , full width at half maximum .",
    "the well - established trend of pulse widths increasing as @xmath66 underestimates this result by a factor of 23 ( e.g. , for the outermost conal component of ) .",
    "polarization calibration and analysis using the psrchive software package @xcite reveals that the radio pulse is substantially linearly polarized , despite the depolarizing effects of multipath propagation in the scattering tail , incomplete removal of faraday rotation ( due to the low signal - to - noise ratio ) , and other effects .",
    "the true polarized fraction in the pulse is likely to be significantly larger than we have observed .",
    "the variation of the polarization vector s position angle with rotational phase , shown in the top - most panel of figure  [ fig : radiotiming ] , is found to be fairly flat , inconsistent with the canonical rotating - vector model @xcite , but similar to behavior seen in the crab pulsar ( especially its high - frequency components ; @xcite ) and several millisecond - period `` recycled '' pulsars @xcite . perhaps not coincidentally ,",
    "many of these same pulsars exhibit nonthermal magnetospheric pulsations in x - rays .",
    "finally , we note that the pulsar s rotation measure is @xmath67  rad  m@xmath68 .",

    "this rejected intervals of south atlantic anomaly passages , earth occultations , and other periods of high particle activity , resulting in a total of 94.2  ks of useful data .",
    "the photon arrival times were transformed to the solar system barycenter in barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) using the jpl de200 ephemeris and the _ chandra_-derived coordinates of cxou  j202221 .",

    "however , it is among the least efficient at converting its spin - down luminosity into x - rays  ergs  @xmath6  s@xmath2 , @xmath106  ergs  s@xmath2 , and @xmath107 . ] , with @xmath108 .",
    "the flat pulsed spectrum also sets it apart from the typical young , energetic pulsar , deviating significantly from the observed trend @xmath109 ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  kev ) , which predicts an index of @xmath110 .",
    "flat power laws have primarily been found among pulsars with h.e.s.s .",
    "counterparts ( e.g. , psr  j1838@xmath460655 ; * ? ? ?",
    "psr  j2022@xmath03842  is also the second - most rapidly rotating young pulsar after the lmc pulsar j0537@xmath466910 , and the shortest - period radio - bright pulsar known .",
    "its radio properties are thus potentially interesting probes of the elusive radio emission mechanism in pulsars , but detailed studies will be hampered by this object s faintness and the interstellar propagation effects imposed by its great distance .",
    "the short rotation period also engenders uncertainty in the pulsar s ( and thus the supernova remnant s ) age : the characteristic age @xmath111  kyr approximates the true age @xmath112 only when @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the spin period at birth ,      where @xmath116 is the so - called `` braking index . '' for a birth period of 16 ms , the shortest known among young pulsars , the true age decreases to @xmath117  kyr , assuming spin - down due to magnetic dipole braking ( @xmath118 ) . a countering effect , however , is spindown that deviates from the standard dipole assumption : the measured braking indices for several young pulsars are found to lie within the range @xmath119 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for example , as shown in figure  [ fig : psrage ] , @xmath120  ms for @xmath121 would imply an age of 11 kyr . for any assumed value of @xmath116 , an upper limit to the age of the pulsar , and thus the remnant ,",
    "is provided in the limit @xmath122 .",
    "a braking index well below @xmath123 would be highly unusual , so that @xmath124  kyr is a reasonable upper limit on the age of g76.9@xmath01.0 .     of psr  j2022@xmath03842  as a function of its spin period at birth , @xmath114",
    ", according to equation  ( [ eq : psrage ] ) ; @xmath116 is the braking index .",
    "the curves correspond , from top to bottom , to @xmath125 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0 ( dashed ) , 3.5 , and 4.0 , converging at the present - day period , @xmath126  ms .",
    "the associated upper - limits on the pulsar age ( for @xmath114 much smaller than @xmath82 ) are @xmath127 , 18 , 12 , 9 , 7 , and 6 kyr , respectively . ]",
    "psr  j2022@xmath03842  lacks the bright x - ray pwn expected from an energetic pulsar : it is only the second example ( of some 20 ) of a pulsar with @xmath128  erg  s@xmath2 unaccompanied by a pwn of comparable brightness , @xmath129 , defying the trend presented in gotthelf ( 2004 ) . as such",
    ", it is similar to psr  j1617@xmath465055  ( torii  1998 ) , the 69  ms pulsar with @xmath130  erg  s@xmath2 , @xmath131  g , and @xmath132  kyr .",
    "the underluminous pwne in these cases remain unexplained . in other respects , however , the x - ray pwn around psr  j2022@xmath03842  may not be so unusual .",
    "the semi - major axis of the elliptical elongation around the unresolved source is approximately @xmath133 in length , representing a physical dimension of @xmath134  cm . for comparison ,",
    "the vela pwn s x - ray `` outer arc '' lies at a distance @xmath135  cm from the pulsar in the geometric model of @xcite .",
    "if the extended emission around psr  j2022@xmath03842  does arise from axisymmetric features , the _ chandra _  image constrains  in analogy with the crab , vela , and others  the orientation of the pulsar s spin axis : in inclination , to @xmath136 , and on the sky , to the symmetry axis at position angle @xmath137 north through east , orthogonal to the long direction of the diffuse x - ray emission and the ridge linking the radio lobes .",
    "the apparent alignment of spin axes and proper motion vectors in some of these same pulsars offers a testable prediction for the motion of psr  j2022@xmath03842 . the spin inclination relative to the line of sight , meanwhile , may help elucidate the role of viewing geometry ( e.g. , relative to a narrow magnetospheric emission beam ) in _ i ) _ producing simultaneously a narrow x - ray pulse but an unexpectedly broad radio pulse , a reversal of their typical relationship , and _",
    "ii ) _ determining whether the observed neutron star spectrum is primarily thermal or nonthermal : the flat spectrum of psr  j2022@xmath03842  departs markedly from the dominant thermal emissions of the central stars in the vela and da  495 snrs .",
    "we have already alluded to some of the notable similarities between g76.9@xmath01.0  and da  495 , both of which can now unambiguously be characterized as radio pwne .",
    "both are very bright radio sources without a well - defined outer boundary .",
    "both manifest a bipolar structure and have a steep radio spectrum , unusual for a pwn . da 495",
    "has a break in its radio spectrum at roughly 1 ghz , and g76.9@xmath01.0  may have one below that as well .",
    "both show very faint x - ray emission compared to their radio emission , and a small x - ray nebula compared to the radio nebula .",
    "the conclusions arrived at by asl+08 for da  495 may thus also apply to g76.9@xmath01.0 . for example , based on the radio / x - ray pwn size ratio of da  495 , @xmath138 , and other lines of argument ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , asl+08 suggested that the pulsar wind energizing da  495 has a high magnetization factor  i.e .",
    ", it carries electromagnetic flux and particle flux at roughly comparable levels  in contrast with the crab , which has a strongly particle - dominated wind , but similar to independent assessments of the wind properties of the vela pulsar .",
    "moreover , asl+08 speculated that , because particle - dominated winds are necessary for efficient conversion of wind luminosity to synchrotron luminosity , pwne in which poynting flux is an important wind component may be those with dim x - ray pwne .",
    "the pwn size ratio for g76.9@xmath01.0  is @xmath139 , comparable to da  495 and nearly two orders of magnitude greater than that for the crab nebula .",
    "( at a distance of 10 kpc , g76.9 + 1.0 may be the largest pwn known in our galaxy , with a physical size of @xmath140  pc , bigger than or comparable to msh 15@xmath4657 , which is at least 25 pc in diameter , @xcite , and so far believed to be the largest galactic pwn . )",
    "if our prior conclusions hold , the wind from psr  j2022@xmath03842  should be highly magnetized well beyond its termination shock , contributing to the low x - ray conversion efficiency of its pwn .",
    "why this might be so is an open question .",
    "the overarching conclusion of asl+08 and @xcite was that da  495 is likely to be a pwn of advanced age ( @xmath141  kyr ) , but having evolved without significant interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "all of the characteristics we find for g76.9@xmath01.0  similarly indicate a rather old object , yet psr  j2022@xmath03842  has all the characteristics of a young object : a spin - down age of 20  kyr would require both @xmath142 and very high spin at birth , @xmath143  ms . we do not have a ready explanation for this apparent discrepancy , which highlights the importance of having uncovered the spin and energetic properties of the central pulsar .",
    "g76.9@xmath01.0  and its pulsar , j2022 + 3842 , are clearly unusual and require further investigation .",
    "additional multi - wavelength observations ( e.g. , an x - ray search for the snr shell , to aid in constraining the system s age ) may be fruitful in providing important components for their understanding . based on its spin - down luminosity , and given the sub - arcsec localization and available timing information , psr  j2022@xmath03842  is a good candidate for a search for gamma - ray pulsations using _ fermi _ data .",
    "the absence of a bright pwn , however , makes it an unlikely tev target , even though the spectrum of the pulsed x - ray emission suggests otherwise .",
