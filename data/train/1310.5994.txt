    "the drell  yan ( dy ) process , i.e. lepton - pair production in hadronic collisions , played an important role in the past in testing the parton model as well as the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the theory of strong interactions .",
    "while at the low - energy hadron colliders the lepton pairs were produced through the virtual @xmath6 exchange , in the recent high - energy colliders ( tevatron , lhc ) the collision energy is sufficient to produce @xmath7 and @xmath8 bosons .",
    "moreover , the cross sections for these processes turn out to be relatively high .",
    "therefore , they they can be used to improve experimental precision of some standard model ( sm ) parameters values , in particular the @xmath3-boson mass @xmath9 and width @xmath10 , the weak - mixing angle @xmath11 and the strong coupling constant @xmath12 . according to pdg  2012  @xcite the experimental errors on",
    "the @xmath3-boson mass and width are respectively : @xmath13mev , @xmath14mev , while while the corresponding errors for the @xmath8 boson are @xmath15mev , @xmath16mev . a difference between the opposite - charge @xmath3 masses",
    "is measured even worse : @xmath17mev .",
    "smaller errors of the @xmath3-boson mass and width will allow for a better indirect determination of the sm higgs - boson mass @xcite . in the case of a direct higgs discovery at the lhc",
    ", this will provide the important consistency test of the standard model @xcite . in order to match the precision of other sm parameters in such fits / tests",
    ", @xmath9 should be measured at the lhc with the accuracy of @xmath18mev or better @xcite .    in theoretical descriptions of the dy processes reaching a sufficiently high precision for the lhc experiments",
    "requires including besides the qcd effects also the electroweak ( ew ) corrections , in particular the qed final - state radiation ( fsr ) @xcite .",
    "it is known that that including @xmath0 ew corrections is not sufficient for the @xmath3-mass precision target at the lhc , because the higher - order fsr effects can shift @xmath9 by @xmath19mev , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "regions of a high transverse momentum of a charged lepton , a large @xmath3-boson transverse mass and a large @xmath8-boson invariant mass are used at the lhc for various `` new physics '' searches . in these regions the @xmath0 ew corrections beyond fsr can be of the size of @xmath20@xmath21 @xcite . because of high statistics of dy events expected at the lhc , these effects must be included in theoretical description of the sm background . however , as was argued in @xcite , for realistic predictions , the ew corrections should be combined in this case with the qcd parton - shower effects .",
    "high statistics of dy data at the lhc will be important to reduce uncertainties of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) over a wide range of the @xmath22 domain , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "dy processes are also treated at the lhc as the so - called ` standard candle ' processes ( detector calibration , normalisation , etc . ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "last but not least , in addition to the standard single dy processes , the so - called double drell  yan processes ( ddyp ) , being a product of double - parton scattering ( dps ) , may play an important role at the lhc , in particular for the higgs - boson searches in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 channels , resulting from its decays into @xmath4 and @xmath5 pairs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "therefore , a precise theoretical description of dy processes is very important for the lhc . in order to be fully exploited by the experiments , such a description ought to be provided in form of a monte carlo event generator . in this paper",
    "we briefly describe the monte carlo event generator  @xcite dedicated to precise theoretical predictions for the dy processes . in section  2",
    "we describe the implementation of the ew corrections as well the qcd effects and discuss their interplay , while in section  3 we briefly review some applications of   to the lhc physics .",
    "finally , section  4 contains summary and outlook .",
    "in the current version of  @xcite the description of the charged - current drell  yan ( cc dy ) processes is more advanced .",
    "it features multiphoton radiation from all charged particles involved in the hard process , implemented within the yennie ",
    "suura ( yfs ) exclusive exponentiation scheme @xcite including the @xmath0 ew corrections . in order to avoid ambiguities related to photon radiation from light quarks , the qed initial - state radiation ( isr )",
    "is subtracted from the ew corrections , however not in @xmath25 or dis schemes , as they are not well suited for a monte carlo event generator .",
    "instead we include in the program three options of the isr subtraction in a gauge - invariant way , with a default one called the yfs scheme , in which from virtual ew corrections for the full cc dy process one subtracts the yfs virtual form factor plus terms @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 is a quark electric charge in the units of the positron charge and @xmath28 is its mass .",
    "generation of qed isr effects is left to general - purpose parton shower generators , such as  or , to which  is , or will , be interfaced . in these generators ,",
    "in addition to primary qcd effects , also qed isr can be generated using the parton shower algorithm .",
    "in such an approach qed radiation is intertwined with the dominant qcd radiation .",
    "this solution is , in our opinion , better than the one in which photon radiation from quarks is generated completely independently of the qcd effects .",
    "more details on the implementation of ew corrections for the cc dy processes in  can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    has been extensively tested numerically and cross - checked with independent monte carlo programs . for the @xmath0 and higher - order qed fsr effects is was compared with  @xcite , while for the @xmath0 ew corrections is was compared with the  monte carlo integrator @xcite . in both cases",
    "the agreement at the per - mille level or better between the results of the programs was found .",
    "currently , there is ongoing work within the lhc electroweak working group on detailed comparisons of various theoretical calculation and monte carlo programs for dy processes  the results should be published soon .    for the nc dy process , in the current version of , only qed fsr effects",
    "are included through the  monte carlo generator .",
    "it implements multiphoton radiation in particle decays using a leading - log - type iterative algorithm where some important non - leading corrections are taken into account @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in the case of @xmath8-boson decays its predictions are in a very good agreement with the ones of the @xmath29 yfs exponentiation .",
    "the  program is a flexible monte carlo event generator .",
    "it includes several options allowing to choose between different collider types : proton  proton , proton - antiproton , ion  ion , between various ew parameter schemes , initial - state quark flavours , final - state lepton flavours , intermediate bosons , types of radiative corrections , weighted or unweighted events , etc .",
    "important options are also possibilities to generate the cc dy processes with polarized @xmath3-bosons ( transverse or longitudinal ) in some predefined reference frames or in a user - defined ones .    for qcd effects",
    "the current version of  is interfaced with the parton shower generator  6.4 .",
    "it generates qcd / qed isr using parton shower algorithm , performs proton - remnant treatment , hadronisation and particle decays .",
    "two kind of interfaces are available now : the first one is the internal interface in which the  routines are called directly from the  code and the second one is based on the les houches accord in which events from  are transmitted to   through special lha - format files @xcite .",
    "the former interface is less universal  it allows to use only some limited set - up of the  parameters , but is faster and more flexible for some dedicated studies , and also includes corrections to pythia  6 for its in improper predictions of lepton transverse momenta @xcite .",
    "the second interface is more universal ",
    "it allows for any set - up of the  parameters , including  tunes . in this case",
    "monte carlo events from  are written in the lha format into disk files and read in by , which performs further processing of events .",
    "we have also added a possibility to transmit the hard - process event from  back to , through another lha file , for some data analysis . instead of ordinary disk files",
    "we prefer to use the unix named ( fifo ) pipes , for which the input / output operations are identical as for ordinary files , but the data transmission goes through ram , not disk , and thus is much faster .",
    "moreover , one does not need to care about overloading disk space with huge data files when high event statistics are generated .",

    "@xcite , in order to provide realistic predictions of the ew effects in dy processes at the lhc and other hadron colliders , the qcd parton shower effects must be taken into account .",
    "the qcd initial - state parton shower in dy processes modifies considerably the transverse momenta of the final - state leptons .",
    "since a lower cut on the charged - lepton transverse momentum @xmath110 is one of the primary cuts used by the lhc experiments for the dy processes , this affects all the dy observables . in table  [ table1 ] we present the results for the born cross sections as well as the ew and ` weak ' corrections for the @xmath111 channel of the cc dy process at the lhc collision energy of @xmath112tev for the increasing lower cut on @xmath110 . in the upper part of the table",
    "we show the results without the qcd parton - shower effects , while in the lower part the ones in which these effects , as generated by , are included . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we present similar results for the @xmath113 channel .",
    "the so - called ` weak ' corrections correspond to the difference of the ew corrections and a dominant gauge - invariant part of the qed corrections , as defined in ref .",
    "one can see by comparing the upper and lower parts of the tables that the qcd parton - shower corrections affect considerably not only the total cross sections but also both ew and ` weak ' corrections .",
    "these changes depend strongly on the @xmath110 cuts and are different for @xmath114 than for @xmath115 .",
    "in particular , the ` weak ' corrections can be up to a factor @xmath116 smaller in the presence of the qcd effects than without them .",
    "therefore , any theoretical predictions of the ew corrections for the dy observables at the lhc without inclusion of the qcd parton - shower effects are not realistic . on the other hand , the ew corrections can be quite sizeable , up to @xmath117 , thus they also have to be taken into account .",
    "one can conclude that any monte carlo event generator for precision physics at the lhc involving the dy processes should include both these effects .",
    "this is particularly important for the @xmath3-boson mass measurement with the precision target below @xmath18mev . in this case even more important than the change of the size of the ew corrections after including the qcd effects is the change of their shape for the @xmath110 distribution , which is the main observable for the @xmath9 measurements at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we have already applied  to several dedicated physics studies of possible measurements at the lhc where the dy processes may play an important role .",
    "our first study was devoted to a possibility of the experimental investigation of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism in proton  ion collisions at the lhc by exploiting the effective beams of polarized @xmath3-bosons and their interactions with spectator quarks @xcite .",
    "then we proposed a way to use the nc dy process , i.e. single-@xmath8 production , at the lhc as a ` standard candle ' for precision measurements of the sm parameters , particularly the ones related to the @xmath3-boson physics @xcite .",
    "our main focus was on investigating the possibility to measure the @xmath3-boson mass @xmath9 as well as the difference @xmath118 at the lhc with the precision of @xmath18mev or better .",
    "this was the subject of a series of papers @xcite .",
    "we discussed important differences between the dy processes at the tevatron and at the lhc and showed that the @xmath9 measurements procedures used at the tevatron can not be applied at the lhc .",
    "we proposed four bias - reducing observables to be used by the lhc experiments in such measurements and argued that a dedicated fix - target `` lhc - support '' experiment with a high - intensity muon beam is needed to achieve the aimed @xmath9 precision target @xcite .",
    "recently , using , we have performed studies of the double drell  yan processes ( ddyp ) , resulting from double - parton scattering ( dps ) , and their possible influence on the higgs - boson searches in its @xmath4 and @xmath119 decay channels .",
    "we have found that ddyp can produce an excess of events in the higgs - signal region corresponding to the higgs mass of @xmath120gev .",
    "this excess can contribute to the background to the higgs signal , and even explain , under certain conditions , the four - lepton event shapes observed by the atlas and cms experiment @xcite .",
    "we have briefly described the program  and its applications to some physics studies at the lhc .  is an efficient and flexible monte carlo event generator for drell  yan processes at the lhc and other hadron colliders .",
    "it features higher - order qed radiative corrections and is interfaced with the  parton shower generator for qcd effects . for the charged - current drell ",
    "yan processes it includes also the @xmath0 electroweak corrections within the yfs exclusive exponentiation scheme .",
    "the original  program is written in the fortran programming language",
    ". currently , its object - oriented versions in c++ are under development : for the charge - current dy processes called  @xcite and for the neutral - current ones called  @xcite . in the future we would like to interface these programs with our own qcd parton shower generator , see refs .",
