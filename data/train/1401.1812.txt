    "how do galaxies get their gas is a key question to better understand their formation and evolution . in the conventional picture ,",
    "the cold gas is accreted onto the dark matter halo , and is shock heated to the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "the hot gas then loses pressure support due to radiative cooling , then settles into a centrifugally supported disc and begins to form stars @xcite .",
    "this picture has been supported by early simulations which have shown that a substantial fraction of cold gas was indeed shock heated after accretion @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical and simulation - based works in the past decade , however , have found two distinct modes of gas accretion , named as hot and cold accretion @xcite .",
    "cold gas flowing along dark matter filaments can be directly accreted onto the central galaxy without being shock heated , cold streams are the main source of gas supply in galaxies especially in low - mass halos of @xmath2 at high redshift @xcite .    simulations also predict that these cold streams , being optically thick lyman - limit systems with low metallicities , could be observable via absorption lines against background - objects @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that cold - flow streams will produce an orbiting circum - galactic component of cool gas with high angular momentum , which might be observable as well .",
    "however , the existence of cold streams has not been confirmed by solid observational results .",
    "observations from @xcite , showed outflow rather than inflow of cold gas in the circum - galactic medium .",
    "@xcite argued that the covering factor might be smaller than @xmath3 at @xmath1 , so the observation of cold streams is very difficult .",
    "very recently , several observations @xcite reported distinct signatures of strong metal poor absorbing systems in the vicinity of galaxies at @xmath4 by observing background quasars",
    ". features of these systems are broadly consistent with the prediction of accreted cold gas in simulations . however , to confirm the existence of cold streams , information on the morphology of the cold gas is needed .",
    "if cold streams do appear at some epoch , the velocity shear between them and hot gas will drive kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability . when the contact surface between cold and hot gas is not aligned with the gravity gradient",
    ", rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instability will also grow .",
    "in addition , thermal evaporation will occur .",
    "another source of instability for the cold flows may come from the very high merger rate of dark matter haloes predicted in the hierarchical scenario , especially at high redshift @xcite .",
    "all these possible sources of perturbation naturally raise the question : how long could the cold streams survive against such instabilities ?    in this letter",
    "we make a first attempt in trying to determine the stability of cold flows .",
    "we employ high resolution hydrodynamical eulerian simulations combined with a simplified set - up that allows us to better understand the impact of all these different sources of instability .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : we present our numerical methods and cold flow model in  2 .",
    "hydrodynamical simulation results are shown in  3 .",
    "discussion and conclusion are given in  4 .",
    "we assume that the cold streams are penetrating through a hot gaseous halo which is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential of the hosting dark matter halo .",
    "the dark matter halo has a mass of @xmath5 and we assume a nfw profiles @xcite with a concentration parameter of 10 following @xcite .",
    "all the cosmological parameters are set in agreement with the wmap5 results @xcite .",
    "the hot halo gas is initially set to be isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium under the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo .",
    "the self gravity of gas is not included .",
    "the central ( stellar ) galaxy component is not considered as we are mainly interested in the hydrodynamical evolution of cold streams within the virial radius .",
    "the temperature of the hot halo is set to @xmath6 , and we assume a poly - tropic index @xmath7 polytropic . finally we extend the gas distribution to 1.5 times the virial radius of the dark matter halo , ( to what we call the boundary radius @xmath8 ) , in order to reduce any possible boundary effect .",
    "the hot gas accounts for @xmath9 of the total mass within @xmath10 .",
    "the morphology , temperature , density and velocity of cold streams are set according to recent theoretical and simulation works @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a very broad statistical study of the cold streams velocity and temperature as function of distance from the halo center for dark matter haloes with @xmath11 at @xmath1 . according to their results we assume the velocity of cold streams at @xmath12 to be @xmath13 .",
    "the cold stream is firstly assumed to be a simple cone geometry , following simulations results @xcite .",
    "the radius of the stream at the boundary @xmath12 is given by @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the stream opening angle and could be derived from the covering factor @xmath16 as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of cold streams in the halo , we adopt the value of @xmath19@xcite . on the other hand the covering factor",
    "@xmath16 is more difficult to estimate .",
    "@xcite predicted that gas at temperature @xmath20 with column densities @xmath21 should cover @xmath22 the area at radii from 20 to 100 kpc in haloes with @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite measured the covering factor for a milky way type progenitor lyman - break galaxy in a cosmological simulation and found a smaller value , which is @xmath25 for the lyman limit systems and @xmath26 for the damped ly@xmath27 absorbers within @xmath10 .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath28 within @xmath12 , in agreement with recent studies by @xcite . therefore , @xmath29",
    ".    the density of cold gas @xmath30 at @xmath12 can be determined by the accretion rate @xmath31 , @xmath32 , the velocity and the mass ratio of cold accretion mode as , @xmath33 where , @xmath34 is the cold accreted gas mass fraction . using the so called extended press & schechter approach @xcite for structure formation , @xcite derived that the growth rate of the baryonic mass at the virial radius should be @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the baryonic fraction in the haloes in units of the cosmic mean . for a halo with @xmath38 ,",
    "it is about @xmath39 at @xmath1 .",
    "however , @xcite found a mean value of @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the total and cold baryonic mass accretion respectively .    for our selected cold accretion rate , @xmath42 , and the number of cold streams , @xmath43 ,",
    "the net accretion rate for one single cold stream is @xmath44 . in our simulation",
    "we only model one such cold stream .",
    "the density of the cold stream at the boundary , @xmath45 is @xmath46 obtained from eq.2 .",
    "the temparature of cold gas is set to @xmath47 , which is almost in thermal pressure quilibrium . in fig.1",
    "we give a schematic of the initial condition , and the simulation parameters are listed in table  [ table ] .",
    "the satellite is described by a single , mass varying particle with an initial mass of @xmath48 @xmath49 , leading to a merger mass ratio of 1/33 .",
    "the orbit of the satellite is predetermined and extracted from a similar high resolution n - body simulation in @xcite .",
    "the initial position of the satellite is at @xmath12 , locating at the opposite side of the cold accretion with respect to the halo center .",
    "the initial radial and tangential velocity of the satellite are respectively set to @xmath50 and @xmath51 times of the virial velocity of the main halo , @xmath52.the mass evolution of the satellite is also extracted , giving @xmath53 at 2 gyr .",
    "finally we assume the orbit plane of the satellite is co - planar with the cold stream plane .",
    "such a choice is motivated by results from n - body simulations @xcite , and by recent observation of a possible `` cosmic alignment '' of galactic satellites in m31 @xcite .",
    "a sketch of our initial configuration and the satellite orbit are presented in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    ".parameters used in the hydrodynamic simulation [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     , the dashed curve is the orbit of the satellite and the red circle mark the position of the satellite at 2 gyrs.,scaledwidth=32.0% ]      to track the evolution of cold streams , we run hydrodynamical simulations with a fixed grid code using the positive preserving weno scheme @xcite , which can effectively keep positive density and pressure in hypersonic regions , and can well capture the motions of the baryonic gas in cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "simulations are performed in a cubic box of 300 kpc , with a number of grid cells @xmath54 , i.e , a resolution of @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "analytical gravitational potentials based on nfw profiles are given at each grid cell initially .",
    "we impose hydrostatic equilibrium for the boundary condition except for the stream .",
    "density and velocity in the ghost grid cells outside the boundary of the simulation box are assumed to be zero - gradient along the radial direction and the pressure is given by a first - order differentiation of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation .",
    "radiative cooling is followed by using the cooling function given in @xcite .",
    "recent simulation works @xcite showed that the metallicity abundance ranges from @xmath57 to @xmath58 @xmath59 for the cold gas .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath60 , and further assume the hot gas has the same value for the sake of simplicity .",
    "thermal conduction is also included with the unsaturated regime assumption , and the thermal conductivity is set to @xmath61 @xcite , with @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the coulomb logarithm , which is only weakly dependent on @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 in our simulation ) .    from our model",
    "set up , the cold gas is injected into the simulation box within an aperture radius of @xmath67 kpc at @xmath12 with a constant rate of @xmath44 , with the density , velocity and temperature given in table.1 .",
    "the constant inflow rate lasts for the whole simulation run , i.e. , 4 gys .",
    "it is found that a stable cold stream towards the halo central region is soon established under the gravity of the host halo , with time less than 1.5 gyr ( top left panel of fig.2 ) .",
    "note that for the cold stream we assume an impact parameter @xmath68 respect to the halo center , as suggested by cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "we perform two sets of simulations , with and without the inclusion of the merging satellite , which are referred to as _ col - mer-512 _ and _ col - ref-512 _ respectively .",
    "the latter simulation is intended to track the effect of thermal conduction and k - h instability , while the former is used to study the impact of an orbiting satellite on the stability of cold flows .",
    "fig .  [ figure2 ] presents the slices of density and temperature distribution of gas at 1.5 , 2.5 , 3.0 and 4.0 gyrs in the simulations without / with the satellite in the upper / lower panels , respectively .",
    "the evolution before 1.5 gyrs , during the formation of the stream , is practically the same in the two simulations and it is not shown .    in the simulation without satellite ,",
    "only subtle changes in morphology , density and temperature happen to the stream after its formation .",
    "thermal conduction results a thin transition layer between the two gas phases and evidence for k - h instability is hard to find .",
    "the cold gas could flow into the central region ( @xmath69 ) with a velocity as high as @xmath70 .",
    "after passing through the inner region , a small fraction of gas flows out of @xmath71 . in a full cosmological simulation",
    "this gas will be retained by the central galaxy and used for star formation .    in the _ col - mer-512 _ simulation",
    ", obvious disturbances have been triggered by the satellite at 2.5 and 3.0 gyrs .",
    "there is practically no flow of cold gas inside @xmath71 at 3.0 gyr .",
    "interestingly enough the cold stream is re - established after 4.0 gyr , when the satellite is far away from the stream .        in order to quantify the effect of satellite on the cold stream , we present in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] the evolution of the net accretion rate of cold gas through a spherical shell at @xmath10 and at @xmath71 .",
    "gas with temperature below @xmath72 k is defined as cold .",
    "the _ col - ref-512 _ run shows an almost constant accretion rate at both radius .",
    "this implies that thermal conduction and gravitational heating are able to convert only a small fraction of the incoming cold gas to the hot phase .",
    "the situation is very different for the _ col - mer-512 _ run .",
    "the accretion rate at both radius shows sharp drops delayed by a couple of hundred myr with respect to the crossing of the stream by the satellite",
    ". the accretion rate at at 0.5 @xmath10 is practically suppressed for a period of @xmath73 gyrs .",
    "this very reduced cold accretion is clearly connected with the close passage of the satellite at @xmath74 gyrs , marked by the red line in the figure .    despite the very destructive effect of the satellite on the stream ,",
    "the cold flow is able to re - build itself quite rapidly in less than 0.3 gyrs .",
    "this shows that in the presence of a continuous accretion of cold gas from cosmological filaments , even if disturbed by orbiting satellites , cold flows are able to regenerate themselves quite rapidly .    ) . in the middle and bottom panels ,",
    "the red line indicate the distance between the satellite and the cold stream.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]",
    "in this letter , inspired by recent simulation works and observations , we have studied the stability of cold streams penetrating through hot gaseous halos in dark matter halos with mass @xmath75 at @xmath1 by hydrodynamic simulations in a simplified scenario .    without external perturbations ( e.g. satellites ) ,",
    "the cold gas is able to flow into the inner region of the central galaxy .",
    "the k - h instability and thermal conduction are not able to inhibit the cold gas accretion .",
    "k - h instability might have been damped by the supersonic motion of the gas due to the low cooling rate @xcite .",
    "when we consider the disturbing action of a satellite ( with a mass ratio of 1:33 ) merging with the central halo , the accretion rate of cold gas at half of the virial radius experiences a dramatic drop for @xmath76 0.5 gyrs . in this period the supply of cold gas into the central region decreases by more than @xmath77 .",
    "cosmological simulations have shown that the merger rate at @xmath1 for our satellite / host mass combination is about two mergers per gyr@xcite .",
    "however , the cross section between isotropically distributed stream and satellites can be crudely estimated by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the volume of cold stream and halo respectively .",
    "therefore , the realistic distribution of cold stream and satellite would play an important role .    even in the case of a direct interaction between the satellite and the stream ,",
    "the flow of cold gas towards the halo center is able to re - establish itself in less than 0.3 gyrs , under the assumption of a continuous flow of cold gas from cosmic filaments .",
    "what we present in this letter is a pilot study for the stability of cold flows .",
    "we plan to improve and extend it in forthcoming works by increasing the resolution of the simulation , considering different satellite orbits and impact parameters , adding the self gravity of the gas and comparing different hydrodynamical approaches ( see @xcite for the effect of the hydro solver on the cold flow stability in cosmological simulations ) .",
    "meanwhile , we expect that further observations may reveal more information about both cold and hot gas in the halo , and more details on galaxy formation and growth .",
