    "<S> this cosmic acceleration is attributed to a mysterious dominant component , dark energy , with negative pressure . </S>",

    "<S> theorists have made lots of efforts to try to resolve the cosmological constant problem but all these efforts were turned out to be unsuccessful .    also , there is an alternative proposal to dark energy  the dynamical dark energy scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical dark energy scenario is often realized by some scalar field mechanism which suggests that the energy form with negative pressure is provided by a scalar field evolving down a proper potential . </S>",

    "<S> however , cohen et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite pointed out that to saturate this inequality some states with schwartzschild radius much larger than the box size have to be counted in . as a result , </S>",

    "<S> li @xcite subsequently proposed that the ir cutoff @xmath8 should be given by the future event horizon of the universe , @xmath18 such a holographic dark energy looks reasonable , since it may provide simultaneously natural solutions to both dark energy problems , as demonstrated in ref . @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> since more and more dark energy models have been constructed for interpreting or describing the cosmic acceleration , the problem of discriminating between the various contenders is becoming emergent . in order to be capable of differentiating between those competing cosmological scenarios involving dark energy , </S>",
    "<S> a sensitive and robust diagnosis for dark energy models is a must . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for some geometrical models arising from modifications to the gravitational sector of the theory , the equation of state no longer plays the role of a fundamental physical quantity , so it would be very useful if we could supplement it with a diagnosis which could unambiguously probe the properties of all classes of dark energy models . for this purpose a diagnostic proposal that makes use of parameter pair @xmath19 , the so - called  statefinder \" , </S>",
    "<S> was introduced by sahni et al . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the statefinder probes the expansion dynamics of the universe through higher derivatives of the scale factor @xmath20 and is a `` geometrical '' diagnosis in the sense that it depends on the scale factor and hence on the metric describing space - time . since different cosmological models involving dark energy exhibit different evolution trajectories in the @xmath21 plane </S>",
    "<S> , the statefinder can be used to diagnose different dark energy models @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on a model of holographic dark energy with interaction between dark energy and dark matter and study the influence of the interaction to the cosmic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we use the statefinder to diagnose various cases with different interaction strength and different parameter @xmath0 in the holographic model .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with dust matter and holographic dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the friedmann equation reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the energy density of matter and @xmath24 is the dark energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy density satisfies a conservation law , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total energy density of the universe , and @xmath27 is the total pressure ( @xmath28 denotes the equation of state of dark energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that since the matter component is mainly contributed by the cold dark matter , we ignore the contribution of the baryon matter here for simplicity . by introducing @xmath29 and @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , the friedmann equation can also be written as @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if we proceed to consider a scenario of interacting dark energy , @xmath23 and @xmath32 do not satisfy independent conservation laws , they instead satisfy @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 describes the interaction between dark energy and dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the interaction term @xmath35 could not be introduced by considering some micro - process currently , so a phenomenological way is the must . </S>",
    "<S> one possible choice for the interaction term is setting @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant describing the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> this expression for the interaction term was first introduced in the study of the suitable coupling between a quintessence scalar field and a pressureless cold dark matter component , in order to get a scaling solution to the coincidence problem @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> taking the ratio of energy densities as @xmath38 and using the friedmann equation @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , from ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ q ] ) , we obtain @xmath42 combining these results , we easily get the equation of state of dark energy @xmath43 where prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath44 .    using the definition of the holographic dark energy </S>",
    "<S> ( [ de ] ) and the friedmann equation , the future event horizon ( [ eh ] ) can be expressed as @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> then , for this expression , taking the derivative with respect to @xmath46 and reducing the result , we get @xmath47 . \\label{5}\\ ] ] it is notable that this differential equation governs the whole dynamics of the interacting model of holographic dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> substituting ( [ 5 ] ) to ( [ 4 ] ) yields @xmath48 then we can compute the deceleration parameter @xmath49     with a fixed parameter @xmath0 . in this plot , we take @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and vary @xmath52 as 0 , 0.02 , 0.06 , and 0.10 , respectively.,width=377 ]     with a fixed coupling @xmath52 . in this plot , we take @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and vary @xmath0 as 0.9 , 1.0 and 1.1 , respectively.,width=377 ]    in order to show the influence of interaction to the cosmic evolution , the cases with dependence of the parameter @xmath52 for the deceleration parameter @xmath55 are shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 2 , fixing the coupling constant @xmath53 , we plot the evolution diagram of the deceleration parameter @xmath55 with different values of parameter @xmath0 ( here we take the values of @xmath0 as 0.9 , 1.0 , and 1.1 , respectively ) . from figs . 1 and 2 we learn that the universe experienced an early deceleration and a late time acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows that , for a fixed parameter @xmath0 , the cosmic acceleration starts earlier for the cases with interaction than the ones without coupling ( for this point see also , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the stronger the coupling between dark energy and dark matter is the earlier the acceleration of universe began . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cases with smaller coupling will get bigger acceleration finally in the far future . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows that the acceleration starts earlier when @xmath0 is larger for the same coupling @xmath52 , but finally a smaller @xmath0 will lead to a bigger acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out that , in the interacting holographic dark energy model , the interaction strength has an upper limit because of the evolutionary behavior of the holographic dark energy . for detailed discussions about correlation of the coupling @xmath52 and the parameter @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that , with the interaction between dark energy and dark matter , the case of @xmath50 could not enter a de sitter phase in the infinite future . in short , the influence of the interaction between dark energy and dark matter to the cosmic evolution is obvious , as manifested by figs . 1 and 2 . on the other hand , nevertheless , as eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 6 ] ) shows , though the deceleration parameter @xmath55 carries the information of the equation of state of dark energy @xmath28 , the property of dynamical evolution for @xmath28 can not be read out from @xmath55 . for diagnosing properties and evolutionary behaviors of dark energy models exquisitely , </S>",
    "<S> more powerful diagnostic tool is a must .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the statefinder diagnosis . for characterizing the expansion history of the universe </S>",
    "<S> , one defines the geometric parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 , namely the hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that @xmath58 means the universe is undergoing an expansion and @xmath59 means the universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion . from the cosmic acceleration , @xmath60 , </S>",
    "<S> one infers that there may exist dark energy with negative equation of state , @xmath61 and likely @xmath62 , but it is hard to deduce the information of the dynamical property of @xmath28 ( namely the time evolution of @xmath28 ) from the value of @xmath55 . in order to extract the information on the dynamical evolution of @xmath28 , it seems that we need the higher time derivative of the scale factor , @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> another motivation for proposing the statefinder parameters stems from the merit that they can provide us with a diagnosis which could unambiguously probe the properties of all classes of dark energy models including the cosmological models without dark energy describing the cosmic acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> though at present we can not extract sufficiently accurate information of @xmath64 and @xmath63 from the observational data , we can expect , however , the high - precision observations of next decade may be capable of doing this . </S>",
    "<S> since different cosmological models exhibit different evolution trajectories in the @xmath21 plane , the statefinder parameters can thus be used to diagnose the evolutionary behaviors of various dark energy models and discriminate them from each other . in this paper , we apply the statefinder diagnosis to the interacting holographic dark energy model .    </S>",
    "<S> the expansion rate of the universe is described by the hubble parameter @xmath65 , and the rate of acceleration / deceleration of the expanding universe is characterized by the deceleration parameter @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in order to find a more sensitive discriminator of the expansion rate , let us consider the general expansion form for the scale factor of the universe @xmath66 generically , various dark energy models give rise to families of curves @xmath67 having vastly different properties . in principle , we can confine our attention to small value of @xmath68 in ( [ aexp ] ) because the acceleration of the universe is a fairly recent phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> then , we see , following @xcite , that a new diagnostic of dark energy dubbed statefinder can be constructed using both second and third derivatives of the scale factor . the second derivative is encoded in the deceleration parameter @xmath55 , and the third derivative is contained in the statefinder parameters @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the statefinder parameters @xmath19 are defined as @xmath69 note that the parameter @xmath70 is also called cosmic jerk . </S>",
    "<S> thus the set of quantities describing the geometry is extended to include @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> trajectories in the @xmath21 plane corresponding to different cosmological models exhibit qualitatively different behaviors , so the statefinder can be used to discriminate different cosmological models . the spatially flat lcdm ( cosmological constant @xmath6 with cold dark matter ) scenario corresponds to a fixed point in the diagram @xmath72 departure of a given dark energy model from this fixed point provides a good way of establishing the `` distance '' of this model from spatially flat lcdm @xcite . as demonstrated in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite@xcite , the statefinder can successfully differentiate between a wide variety of dark energy models including the cosmological constant , quintessence , phantom , quintom , the chaplygin gas , braneworld models and interacting dark energy models , etc .. we can clearly identify the `` distance '' from a given dark energy model to the lcdm scenario by using the @xmath73 evolution diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the current location of the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath70 in these diagrams can be calculated in models . </S>",
    "<S> the current values of @xmath74 and @xmath70 are evidently valuable since we expect that they can be extracted from data coming from snap ( supernovae acceleration probe ) type experiments . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the statefinder diagnosis combined with future snap observations may possibly be used to discriminate between different dark energy models .. the statefinder parameter - pair also can be expressed as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total density and @xmath77 is the total pressure . </S>",
    "<S> then , by using the friedmann equation , we can obtain the following concrete expressions @xmath78 directly , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ w ] ) , we have @xmath79,\\label{w1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the whole dynamics of the universe in the interacting holographic dark energy model is governed by the differential equation ( [ 5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> so by solving eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 5 ] ) we can get the evolution solution of @xmath80 and then hold all the cosmological quantities of interest and the whole dynamics of the universe .     for the interacting holographic dark energy with a fixed parameter @xmath0 and different coupling @xmath52 </S>",

    "<S> we shall analyze the cases with fixed coupling constant @xmath52 and with fixed parameter @xmath0 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as demonstrated above , the information of this model can be acquired by solving the differential equation ( [ 5 ] ) . making the redshift @xmath84 vary in a large enough range involving far future and far past </S>",
    "<S> , one can solve the differential equation ( [ 5 ] ) numerically and then get the evolution trajectories in the statefinder @xmath21 planes for this model . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we plot the statefinder diagram in fig . 3 for the cases of @xmath50 with various values of coupling such as @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , meanwhile the present density parameter of dark energy </S>",
    "<S> is taken to be @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath85 corresponds to the holographic dark energy model without interaction between dark energy and dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows in the diagram denote the evolution directions of the statefinder trajectories and the star corresponds to @xmath89 representing the lcdm model . </S>",
    "<S> this diagram shows that the evolution trajectories with different interaction strengths exhibit different features in the statefinder plane . </S>",
    "<S> when the interaction is absent , the @xmath73 curve for holographic dark energy ends at the lcdm fixed point , i.e. , the universe of this case will evolve to the de sitter phase in the far future . </S>",
    "<S> however , taking the interaction into account , the endpoints of the @xmath73 curves could not arrive at the lcdm fixed point @xmath81 , though all of the evolution trajectories tend to approach this point . </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned that the statefinder diagnosis for holographic dark energy model without interaction has been investigated in detail in @xcite , where the focus is put on the diagnosis of the different values of parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the statefinder analysis on the holographic dark energy in a non - flat universe see @xcite . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it has been demonstrated that from the statefinder viewpoint @xmath0 plays a significant role in this model and it leads to the values of @xmath90 in today and future tremendously different . in this paper , by far , we have clearly seen that the interaction between holographic dark energy and dark matter makes the statefinder evolutionary trajectories with the same value of @xmath0 tremendously different also . </S>",
    "<S> if the accurate information of @xmath91 can be extracted from the future high - precision observational data in a model - independent manner , these different features in this model can be discriminated explicitly by experiments , one thus can use this method to test the holographic dark energy model as well as other dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> hence , today s values of @xmath92 play a significant role in the statefinder diagnosis . </S>",
    "<S> we thus calculate the present values of the statefinder parameters for different cases in the interacting holographic dark energy model and mark them on evolution curves with dots . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that stronger interaction results in longer distance to the lcdm fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between holographic dark energy and dark matter prevents the holographic dark energy from behaving as a cosmological constant @xmath6 ultimately in the far future .    </S>",
    "<S> we also plotted the statefinder diagram in the @xmath21 plane for different values of parameter @xmath0 with @xmath85 and @xmath88 in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the left panel is for the holographic dark energy without interaction while the right one is for the case involving the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the star in the figure also corresponds to the lcdm fixed point and the dots marked on the curves represent the present values of the statefinder parameters . </S>",
    "<S> note that the true values of @xmath82 of the universe should be determined in a model - independent way , we can only pin our hope on the future experiments to achieve this . </S>",
    "<S> we strongly expect that the future high - precision experiments ( e.g. snap ) may provide sufficiently large amount of precise data to release the information of statefinders @xmath93 in a model - independent manner so as to supply a way of discriminating different cosmological models with or without dark energy . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , we can learn that the @xmath73 evolutions have the similar behavior , i.e. the curves almost start from a fixed point for both cases in the @xmath21 plane . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the interaction between dark components makes the value of @xmath70 smaller and the value of @xmath74 bigger . </S>",
    "<S> also , obviously , the parameter @xmath0 plays a crucial role in the holographic model .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83{ww1b0.eps } & \\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{ww1b01.eps } \\end{array}$ ]    as a complement to statefinder diagnosis , we investigate the dynamical property of the interacting holographic dark energy in the @xmath1 phase plane , where @xmath94 represents the derivative of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , this method became somewhat popular for analyzing dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> caldwell and linder @xcite proposed to explore the evolving behavior of quintessence dark energy models and test the limits of quintessence in the @xmath1 plane , and they showed that the area occupied by quintessence models in the phase plane can be divided into thawing and freezing regions . </S>",
    "<S> then , the method was used to analyze the dynamical property of other dark energy models including more general quintessence models @xcite , phantom models @xcite and quintom models @xcite , etc .. the @xmath1 analysis undoubtedly provides us with an alternative way of classifying dark energy models using the quantities describing the dynamical property of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> but , it is obviously that the @xmath96 pair is related to statefinder pair @xmath97 in a definite way , see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ r ] ) and ( [ s ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the merit of the statefinder diagnosis method is that the statefinder parameters are constructed from the scale factor @xmath98 and its derivatives , and they are expected to be extracted in a model - independent way from observational data , although it seems hard to achieve this at present . while the advantage of the @xmath1 analysis is that it is a direct dynamical diagnosis for dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the statefinder @xmath21 geometrical diagnosis and the @xmath1 dynamical diagnosis can be viewed as complementarity in some sense .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us investigate the interacting model of holographic dark energy in the @xmath1 plane . in fig . 5 , we plot the evolutionary trajectories of the holographic dark energy in the @xmath1 plane where the selected curves correspond to @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the left graph is an illustrative example without interaction to which we can compare the evolution of the interacting holographic dark energy in the right diagram . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 shows clearly that the parameter @xmath0 and the interaction @xmath52 both play important roles in the evolution history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the left graph tells us : @xmath102 makes the holographic dark energy behave as quintessence - type dark energy with @xmath103 and @xmath104 makes the holographic dark energy behave as quintom - type dark energy with @xmath28 crossing @xmath105 during the evolution history . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the interaction between dark components is present , the situation becomes somewhat ambiguous because that the equation of state @xmath28 loses the ability of classifing dark energies definitely , due to the fact that the interaction makes dark energy and dark matter be entangled in each other . in this circumstance , the conceptions such as quintessence , phantom and quintom are not so clear as usual . </S>",
    "<S> but , anyway , we can still use these conceptions in an undemanding sense . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that when we refer to these conceptions the only thing of interest is the equation of state @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 tells us : with the interaction ( a case of strong coupling , @xmath53 ) , @xmath106 makes the holographic dark energy behave as phantom - type dark energy with @xmath107 and @xmath108 makes the holographic dark energy behave as quintom - type dark energy with @xmath28 crossing @xmath105 during the evolution history . in this diagram , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the interaction is shown again . </S>",
    "<S> when the coupling between the two components is absent , the value of @xmath94 first decreases from zero to a minimum then increases again to zero meanwhile the value of @xmath28 decreases monotonically . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , for the case involving the interaction , @xmath28 increases first to a maximum and then decreases meanwhile @xmath94 decreases from a maximum to a negative minimum first and then increases to zero again . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we see that the @xmath1 dynamical diagnosis can provide us with a useful complement to the statefinder geometrical diagnosis .    in summary , we have studied the interacting holographic dark energy model from the statefinder viewpoint in this paper . since the accelerated expansion of the universe was found by astronomical observations , </S>",
    "<S> many cosmological models involving dark energy component or modifying gravity have been proposed to interpret this cosmic acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a problem of how to discriminate between these various contenders . </S>",
    "<S> the statefinder diagnosis provides a useful tool to break the possible degeneracy of different cosmological models by constructing the parameters @xmath92 using the higher derivative of the scale factor . </S>",
    "<S> thus the method of plotting the evolutionary trajectories of dark energy models in the statefinder plane can be used to as a diagnostic tool to discriminate between different models . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the values of @xmath92 of today , if can be extracted from precise observational data in a model - independent way , can be viewed as a discriminator for testing various cosmological models . on the other hand , though we are lacking an underlying theory of the dark energy , this theory is presumed to possess some features of a quantum gravity theory , which can be explored speculatively by taking the holographic principle of quantum gravity theory into account . </S>",
    "<S> so the holographic dark energy model provides us with an attempt to explore the essence of dark energy within a framework of fundamental theory . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , some physicists believe that the involving of interaction between dark energy and dark matter leads to some alleviation and more understanding to the coincidence problem . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus worthwhile to investigate the interacting model of holographic dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed the interacting holographic dark energy model employing the statefinder parameters as a diagnostic tool . </S>",
    "<S> the statefinder diagrams show that the interaction between dark sectors can significantly affect the evolution of the universe and the contributions of the interaction can be diagnosed out explicitly in this method . at </S>",
    "<S> last , as the complement to the statefinder geometrical diagnosis , a dynamical diagnosis was also studied , which diagnoses the dynamical property of the interacting holographic dark energy in the @xmath1 phase plane . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that the future high - precision observations can offer more and more accurate data to determine these parameters precisely and consequently shed light on the essence of dark energy . </S>"
