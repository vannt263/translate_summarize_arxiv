    "in the world of galaxies , the milky way is in many ways as typical as it gets : half of the universe s present - day stars live in galaxies that match our milky way in stellar mass , size , chemical abundance , etc . within factors of a few ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "but for us , it is the only galaxy whose stellar distribution we can see in its full dimensionality : star - by - star we can obtain 3d positions and 3d velocities ( @xmath0 ) , coupled with the stars photospheric element abundances and constraints on their ages . we know that in principle this enormous wealth of information about the stellar body of our galaxy holds a key to recognizing and understanding some of the mechanisms that create and evolve disk galaxies . and it holds a key to mapping the three - dimensional gravitational potential and by implication the dark matter distribution in the milky way .",
    "a sequence of ongoing photometry and spectroscopy surveys has recently hundred - folded the number of stars with good distances , radial and transverse velocities , and abundance estimates ; this only forebodes the data wealth expected from esa s flagship science mission gaia to be launched next year .    yet ,",
    "practical approaches to extract the enormous astrophysical information content of these data remain sorely underdeveloped .",
    "it is not even qualitatively clear at this point what will limit the accuracy of any galaxy - formation or dark - matter inferences : the sample sizes , the fraction of the milky way s stellar body covered ( cf .",
    "[ fig : gaia - survey - volume ] ) , the precision of the @xmath1- @xmath2  phase - space measurements , the quality and detail of the abundance information , or the ( lack of ) stellar age estimates .",
    "are dynamical analyses limited by the precision with which sample selection functions can be specified , or by the fact that dust obscuration and crowding will leave the majority ( by stellar - mass - weighted volume ) of milky way stars unobserved even if all currently planned experiments worked our perfectly ? or are dynamical inferences limited by the fact that the symmetry and equilibrium assumptions , which underlie most dynamical modeling , are only approximations ?",
    "the ongoing data deluge and the continuing recognition how much our milky way , despite being ` just one galaxy ' , may serve as a rosetta stone for galaxy studies , have triggered a great deal of preparatory work on how to analyze and model these data .",
    "many of the scientific and practical issues have been laid out , e.g. , in @xcite or @xcite . yet",
    ", it appears ( at least to the authors ) that the existing survey interpretation and modeling approaches are still woefully inadequate to exploit the full information content of even the existing galactic stellar surveys , let alone the expected information content of gaia data .    and while the science theme of ` understanding the current structure of the galaxy and reconstructing its formation history ' remains of central interest to astrophysics , the specific questions that should be asked of the data have evolved since the original gaia mission science case was laid out , through advances in our understanding of galaxy formation in the cosmological framework and recent work on secular galaxy evolution .",
    "the aim of simply ` reconstructing ' the formation history of the galaxy in light of even idealized gaia data , now seems naive .",
    "the review here will restrict itself to the galactic stars ( as opposed to the galactic interstellar medium ) , and in particular to the milky way s dominant stellar component , its _ disk _ , which contains about three quarters of all galactic stars . as a shorthand",
    ", we will use the term _ disk _ ( capitalized ) to refer to the ` milky way s stellar disk ' .",
    "all other disks will be labeled by qualifying adjectives .",
    "the discussion will focus on the _ stellar _ disk of our galaxy and dark matter in the _ central _ parts of the overall milky way halo ,  ( @xmath3kpc ) , with only cursory treatment of the other stellar components , the gas and dust in the milky way , and the overall halo structure .",
    "perhaps our neglect of the galactic bar is most problematic in drawing scope boundaries for this review , as the interface between disk and bar is both interesting and unclear , and because it is manifest that the present - day galactic bar has an important dynamical impact on the dynamics and evolution of the disk ; yet , the galactic bar s role and complexity warrants a separate treatment .",
    "the questions about galaxy disk formation that a detailed analysis of the milky way may help answer are manyfold .",
    "what processes might determine galaxy disk structure ?",
    "in particular , what processes set the exponential radial and vertical profiles seen in the stellar distributions of galaxy disks ? were all or most stars born from a well - settled gas disk near the disk plane and acquired their vertical motions subsequently ? or was some fraction of disk stars formed from very turbulent gas early on ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , forming a primordial thick disk ?",
    "are there discernible signatures of the stellar energy feedback to the interstellar medium that global models of galaxy formation have identified as a crucial ` ingredient ' of ( disk ) galaxy formation @xcite ? what was the role of internal heating in shaping galaxy disks ?",
    "what has been the role of radial migration @xcite , i.e. , the substantive changes in the stars mean orbital radii that are expected to occur without boosting the orbits eccentricity ?",
    "what was the disk - shaping role of minor mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are deemed an integral part of the @xmath4cdm  cosmogony ? how much did in - falling satellites impulsively heat the milky way s disk , potentially leading to a distinct thick disk @xcite ?",
    "how much stellar debris did they deposit in this process ? is the radial orbit migration induced by satellite infall @xcite distinguishable from purely internal processes ?",
    "all of these questions are not only relevant for the milky way in particular , but lead generically to the question of how resilient stellar disks are to tidal interactions ; it has been claimed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the existence of large , thin stellar disks poses a challenge to the merger - driven @xmath4cdm  picture .    in the end ,",
    "answers to these questions require a multi - faceted comparison of the disk s observable status quo to the expectations from _ ab initio _ formation models , in practice for the most part hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "however , the current generation of ` cosmological ' disk galaxy formation models is more illustrative than exhaustive in their representation of possible disk galaxy formation histories ; therefore the question of how to test for the importance of galaxy formation _",
    "ingredients _ through comparison with observational data is actively underway .",
    "the maximal amount of empirical information about the disk that one can gather from data is a joint constraint on the gravitational potential in which stars orbit @xmath5 and on the _ chemo - orbital distribution function _ of the disk s stars .",
    "how to best obtain such a joint constraint is a problem solved in principle , but not in practice ( see sections  [ sec : diskgravpot ] & [ sec : dynmod ] ) .",
    "it is in this context that this review sets out to work towards three broad goals :    * synthesize what the currently most pertinent questions about dark matter , disk galaxy formation and evolution are that may actually be addressed with stellar surveys of the galactic disk .",
    "* lay out what ` modeling ' of large stellar samples means and emphasize some of the practical challenges that we see ahead . *",
    "describe how recent work may change our thinking about how to best address these questions .",
    "compared to @xcite and @xcite for an empirical description of the milky way disk , and compared to a series of papers by binney and collaborators on dynamical modeling of the galaxy @xcite , we place more emphasis two aspects that we deem crucial in galactic disk modeling :    * the consideration of ` mono - abundance ' stellar sub - populations ( maps ) , asking the question of ` what our milky way disk would look like if we had eyes for stars of only a narrow range of photospheric abundances ' . the importance of ` mono - abundance components ' arises from the fact that in the presence of significant radial migration , chemical abundances are the only life - long _ tags _ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that stars have , which can be used to isolate sub - groups independent of presuming a particular dynamical history .",
    "in a collisionless system , such populations can be modeled completely independently ; yet they have to ` feel ' the same gravitational potential . *",
    "the central importance of the ( foremost spatial ) selection function of any stellar sample that enters modeling .",
    "dynamical modeling links the stars kinematics to their spatial distribution .",
    "different subsets of disk stars ( differing e.g. by abundance ) have dramatically different spatial and kinematical distributions .",
    "if the spatial selection function of any sub - set of stars with measured kinematics is not known to better than some accuracy , this will pose a fundamental limitation on dynamical inferences , irrespective of how large the sample is ; with ever larger samples emerging , understanding the selection function is increasingly probably to be a limiting factor in the analysis .",
    "the remainder of the review is structured as follows : in section 2 we discuss in more detail the overall characterization of the milky way s disk and detail the open questions of stellar disk formation and evolution in a cosmological context . in section 3",
    "we provide an overview of the existing and emerging stellar galactic surveys and in section 4 we describe how the survey selection function can and should be rigorously handled in modeling ; . in sections 5 and 6 we present recent results in dynamical and structural modeling of the disk , and their implications for future work . in the closing section 7",
    ", we discuss what we deem the main practical challenges and promises for this research direction in the next years .",
    "` understanding ' the disk could mean having a comprehensive empirical characterization for it and exploring which  possibly competing  theoretical concepts that make predictions for these characteristics match , or do not .",
    "as the milky way is only one particular galaxy and as disk galaxy formation is a complex process that predicts broad distributions for many properties , it may be useful to consider which disk characteristics generically test formation concepts , rather than simply representing one of many possible disk formation outcomes .      in a casual , luminosity or mass - weighted average",
    ", the disk can be characterized as a highly flattened structure with an ( exponential ) radial scale length of @xmath6 and scale height of @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is kinematically cold in the sense that the characteristic stellar velocity dispersions near the sun of @xmath8 are far less than @xmath9 .",
    "current estimates for the overall structural parameters of the milky way are compiled in table 1.2 of @xcite ; more specifically estimates for the mass of the disk are @xmath10 @xcite , though the most recent data sets have not yet been brought to bear on this basic number .",
    "no good estimates for the globally averaged metallicity of the disk exist , though @xmath11}}\\rangle$ ] being about at the solar value seems likely .    with these bulk properties ,",
    "the milky way and its disk are very ` typical ' in the realm of present - day galaxies : comparable numbers of stars in in the low - redshift universe live in galaxies larger and smaller ( more and less metal - rich ) than the milky way . for its stellar mass ,",
    "the structural parameters of the disk are also not exceptional ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps the most unusual aspect of the milky way is that its stellar disk is so dominant , with a luminosity ratio of bulge - to - disk of about 1:5 @xcite : most galaxies of m@xmath12 are much more bulge dominated @xcite .    but describing the disk by ` characteristic ' numbers , as one is often forced to do in distant galaxies , does not even begin to do justice to the rich patterns that we see in the disk : it has been long established that positions , velocities , chemical abundances , and ages are very strongly and systematically correlated .",
    "this is in the sense that younger and/or more metal rich stars tend to be on more nearly circular orbits with lower velocity dispersions . of course , stellar populations with lower ( vertical ) velocity dispersions will form a thinner disk component . this has led to the approach of defining sub - components of the disk on the basis of the spatial distribution , kinematics , or chemical abundances .",
    "most common has been to describe the disk in terms of a dominant thin disk and a thick disk , with thin ",
    "thick disk samples of stars defined spatially , kinematically , or chemically .",
    "while these defining properties are of course related , they do not isolate identical subsets of stars . whether it is sensible to parse the disk structure into only two distinct components",
    "is discussed below .",
    "much of what we know about these spatial , kinematical , and chemical correlations within the disk has come until very recently from very local samples of stars , either from studies at @xmath13 or from the seminal and pivotal hipparcos / geneva - copenhagen sample of stars drawn from within @xmath14 @xcite . as dynamics",
    "links local and global properties , it is perfectly possible and legitimate to make inferences about larger volumes than the survey volume itself ; yet , it is important to keep in mind that the volume - limited geneva - copenhagen sample encompasses a volume that corresponds to two - millionths of the disk s half - mass volume .",
    "only recently have extensive samples beyond the solar neighborhood with @xmath15}}})$ ] become available .",
    "while a comprehensive empirical description of the disk ( spatial , kinematical , abundances ) in the immediate neighborhood of the sun has revealed rich correlations that need explaining , an analogous picture encompassing a substantive fraction of the disk with direct observational constraints is only now emerging .",
    "but the disk is neither perfectly smooth nor perfectly axisymmetric , as the above description implied .",
    "this is most obvious for the youngest stars that still remember their birthplaces in star clusters and associations and in spiral arms .",
    "but is also true for older stellar populations . on the one hand ,",
    "the spiral arms and the galactic bar are manifest non - axisymmetric features , with clear signatures also in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by now the strength of the galactic bar and its pattern speed",
    "seem reasonably well established , both on the basis of photometry @xcite and on the basis of dynamics @xcite .",
    "but we know much less about spiral structure in the stellar disk .",
    "while the location of the nearby galactic spiral arms have long been located on the bases of the dense gas geometry and distance measurements to young stars , the existence and properties of dynamically - important stellar spiral structure is completely open : neither has there been a sound measure of a spiral stellar over - density that should have dynamical effects , nor has there been direct evidence for any response of the disk to stellar spirals . clarifying the dynamical role of spiral arms in the milky way presumably has to await gaia .",
    "in addition there is a second aspect of non - axisymmetric sub - structure , which is known to be present in the disk , but which is far from being sensibly characterized : there are groups of chemically similar stars on similar but very unusual orbits ( streams , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that point towards an origin where they were formed in a separate satellite galaxy and subsequently deposited in the disk in a ( minor ) merger .",
    "the process of disk heating and disk _ augmentation _ through minor mergers has been simulated extensively , both with collisionless and with hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : these simulations have shown that galaxy disks can absorb considerably more satellite infall and debris than initial estimates had suggested @xcite . however , these simulations also indicated that  especially for prograde satellite infall  it is not always easy to recognize satellite debris by its orbit , once it has been incorporated into the disk .      explaining the formation and evolution of galaxy disks has a 50-year history , gaining prominence with the seminal papers by @xcite and @xcite . yet , producing a galaxy through _ ab initio _ calculations that in its disk properties resembles the milky way has remained challenging to this day .",
    "exploring the formation of galaxy disks through simplified ( semi-)analytic calculations has yielded seemingly gratifying models , but at the expense of ignoring ` detail ' that is known to play a role .",
    "milestones in this approach were in particular the work by @xcite that put @xcite s idea of gas collapse under angular momentum conservation into the cosmological context of an appropriately sized halo that acquired a plausible amount of angular momentum through interactions with its environment : this appeared as a cogent explanation for galactic disk sizes .",
    "these concepts were married with the press & schechter @xcite formalism and its extensions by @xcite , to place disk formation in the context of halos that grew by hierarchical merging .",
    "this approach performed well in explaining the overall properties of the present - day galaxy disk population and also its redshift evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    yet ,",
    "trouble in explaining disks came with the efforts to explain galaxy disk formation using ( hydrodynamical ) simulations in a cosmological context . the first simulations @xcite , which started from unrealistically symmetrical and quiescent initial conditions , yielded end - products that resembled observed galaxy disks .",
    "but then the field entered a 15 year period in which almost all simulations produced galaxies that were far too bulge - dominated and whose stellar disks were either too small , or too anemic ( low mass fraction ) , or both .",
    "of course , it was clear from the start that this was a particularly hard problem to tackle numerically : the initial volume from which material would come ( @xmath16 ) and the thin - ness of observed disks ( @xmath17 ) implied very large dynamic ranges , and the ` sub - grid ' physics issue of when to form stars from gas and how this star - formation would feed back on the remaining gas played a decisive role .",
    "as of 2012 , various groups @xcite have succeeded in running simulations that can result in large , disk - dominated galaxies , resembling the milky way in many properties ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : guedes ] ) .",
    "this progress seems to have  in good part ",
    "arisen from the explicit or implicit inclusion of physical feedback processes that had previously been neglected . in particular , ` radiative feedback ' or ` early stellar feedback ' from massive stars before they explode as supernovae seems to have been an important missing feedback ingredient and must be added in simulations to the well - established supernovae feedback @xcite . with such  physically expected  feedback implemented , disk dominated galaxies can be made in ab initio simulations that have approximately correct stellar - to - halo mass fractions for a wide range of mass scales .",
    "in some of the other cases , cf .",
    "@xcite , the radiative feedback is not implemented directly , but cooling - suppression below @xmath18  k has a similar effect .",
    "it appears that the inclusion of this additional feedback not only makes disk dominated galaxies a viable simulation outcome , but also improves the match to the galaxy luminosity function and tully - fisher relations .",
    "this all constitutes long - awaited success , but is certainly far from having any definitive explanation for the formation of any particular galaxy disk , including ours .",
    "in particular , a very uncomfortable dependence of the simulation outcome on various aspects of the numerical treatment remains , which has recently been summarized by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fully cosmological simulations , a large body of work has investigated processes relevant to disk evolution from an analytic or numerical perspective , with an emphasis on chemical evolution and the formation and evolution of thick - disk components . the chemical evolution of the milky way has been studied with a variety of approaches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mostly with physically motivated but geometrically simplified models ( not cosmological ab initio simulations ) : these studies have aimed at constraining the cosmological infall of fresh gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , explain the origin of radial abundance gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and explore the role of galactic fountains , i.e. gas blown from the disk , becoming part of a rotating hot corona , and eventually returning to the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent work by @xcite has introduced a new approach to modeling the evolution of the disk by combining detailed chemical evolution models with cosmological @xmath19-body simulations .",
    "to explain in particular the vertical disk structure qualitatively different models have been put forward , including cosmologically - motivated mechanisms where stars from a disrupted satellite can be directly accreted @xcite , or the disk can be heated through minor mergers @xcite or experience a burst of star formation following a gas - rich merger @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the disk could have been born with larger velocity dispersion than is typical at @xmath20 @xcite , or purely internal dynamical evolution due to radial migration may gradually thicken the disk @xcite .",
    "it is likely that a combination of these mechanisms is responsible for the present - day structure of the disk , but what relative contributions of these effects should be expected has yet to be worked out in detail , and none of these have been convincingly shown to dominate the evolution of the disk .    radial migration is likely to have a large influence on the observable properties of the disk , if its role in shaping the bulk properties of the disk were sub - dominant .",
    "the basic process as described by @xcite consists of the scattering of stars at the corotation radius of transient spiral arms ; at corotation such scattering changes the angular momentum , @xmath21 , of the orbit ( @xmath22mean radius ) without increasing the orbital random energy . a similar  and potentially more efficient ",
    "process was later shown to happen when the bar and spiral structure s resonances overlap @xcite .",
    "such changes in the mean orbital radii are expected to be of order unity within a few gyrs , and to have a profound effect on the interpretation of the present - day structure of the disk : e.g.present-day @xmath21 can no longer be used as a close proxy for the birth @xmath21 , even for stars on near - circular orbits . quantifying the strength of radial migration in the milky way is one of the most pertinent action items for the next - generation of milky way surveys .",
    "a brief synthesis of the predictions from all these efforts is as follows :    * stellar disks should generically form from the inside out . more specifically",
    ", it is the low angular momentum gas that settles first near the centers of the potential wells forming stars at small radii .",
    "* disk - dominated galaxies with disk sizes in accord with observations can emerge , if , and only if , there is no major merger since @xmath23 . *",
    "the luminosity- or mass - weighted radial stellar density profiles at late epochs resemble exponentials .",
    "* stars that formed at earlier epochs ( @xmath24 ) , when the gas fraction was far higher , do not form from gas disks that are as well - settled and thin as they are at @xmath25 with dispersions of @xmath26 .",
    "* characteristic disk thicknesses or vertical temperatures of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are plausible .",
    "* material infall , leading to fresh gas supply and dynamical disk heating , and star formation is not smooth but quite variable , even episodic , with a great deal of variation among dark matter halos with the same overall properties . it is rare that one particular infall or heating event dominates . * throughout their formation histories galaxies exhibit significant non - axisymmetries , which at epochs later than @xmath23 resemble bars and spiral arms . through resonant interactions",
    ", these structures may have an important influence on the evolution of stellar disks .",
    "learning about the orbits of different disk stellar sub - populations as a galaxy formation constraint and learning from these stars about the gravitational potential , @xmath29 , are inexorably linked .",
    "those orbits are generally described by a _ chemo - orbital distribution function _ , @xmath30 } } } , { { \\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}}}| \\phi ( { \\vec{x}})\\bigr ) $ ] that quantifies the probability of being on an orbit labeled by @xmath31 for each subset of stars ( characterized by , e.g. , by their ages @xmath32 or their chemical abundances @xmath33}}}={\\ensuremath{[\\mathrm{fe / h } ] } } , { \\ensuremath{[\\alpha\\mathrm{/fe } ] } } , \\ldots$ ] ) . here , we chose to characterize the orbit ( the argument of the distribution function ) by @xmath34 , actions or integrals of motion ( which depend on both its observable instantaneous phase - space coordinates @xmath35 and on @xmath29 ) .",
    "each star then also has an orbital phase ( or angle ) , @xmath36 , whose distribution is usually assumed to be uniform in @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "unless direct accelerations are measured for stars in many parts of the galaxy , many degenerate combinations of @xmath29 and @xmath38 } } } , { { \\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}}})$ ] exist , unless astrophysically - plausible constraints and/or assumptions are imposed : time - independent steady - state solutions , axisymmetric solutions , uniform phase distributions of stars on the same orbit , etc .",
    "this is the art and craft of stellar dynamical modeling @xcite .",
    "learning about the galactic potential is one central aspect of such dynamical modeling . on scales larger than individual galaxies ,",
    "the so - called standard @xmath4cdm  cosmology has been tremendously successful in its quantitative predictions .",
    "if certain characteristics for dark energy and dark matter are adopted the large - scale matter and galaxy distribution can be well explained ( including baryon acoustic oscillations ) and be linked to the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background . on the scales of galaxies and smaller , theoretical predictions are more complex , both because all of these scales are highly non - linear and because the cooling baryons constitute an important , even dominant mass component .",
    "indeed , the @xmath4cdm  paradigm seems to make at least two predictions that are unsubstantiated by observational evidence , or even in seeming contradiction .",
    "not only are numerous low - mass dark - matter halos predicted , almost completely devoid of stars ( @xcite ) , @xmath4cdm  simulations also predict that dark matter profiles are cuspy , i.e. , have divergent dark matter densities towards their centers @xcite . in galaxies as massive as our milky way",
    ", baryonic processes could not easily turn the dark matter cusp into a core , as seems viable in low mass galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we should expect for the milky way that more than half of the mass within a sphere of @xmath39 should be dark matter .",
    "yet microlensing towards the milky way bulge @xcite indicates that in our own galaxy most of the in - plane column density is made up of stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "measurements in individual external galaxies remain inconclusive , because dynamical tracers only measure the total mass , but can not separate the stellar and dm contributions . in the milky way , almost all stellar mass beyond",
    "the bulge is in a stellar disk and hence very flat , while the dm halos emerging from @xmath4cdm  simulations are spheroidal or ellipsoidal .",
    "so , mapping the milky way s mass near the disk plane as a function of radius through the vertical kinematics will break the so - called disk ",
    "halo degeneracy , when combined with the rotation curve and the outer halo mass profile : one can then separate the flat from the round - ish mass contributions .",
    "perhaps the most immediate goal of dynamical disk modeling is to determine how much dm there is within the solar radius : as little as implied by the microlensing results , or as much as predicted by @xmath4cdm  cosmology .",
    "a second goal for the galactic potential is to determine whether the disk - like total mass distribution is as thin as the stellar counts imply ; this is interesting , because the possibility of a thick dark matter disk has been raised @xcite .",
    "finally , we can combine precise constraints from near the galactic disk with constraints from stellar halo streams ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to get the shape of the potential as a function of radius .",
    "this can then be compared to the expectations , e.g. , of alternative gravity models , and provide another , qualitatively new test for the inevitability of some form of dark matter .",
    "on the other hand , the best possible constraints on @xmath40 are necessary to derive the ( chemo-)orbital distribution of stars ( the ` distribution function ' , df ) , as the orbit characteristic , such as the actions depend of course on both @xmath41 of the stars and on @xmath40 .",
    "the ideal survey would result in an all - encompassing catalog of stars throughout the disk , listing their 3-d positions and 3-d velocities ( @xmath42 ) , elemental abundances ( @xmath43 $ ] ) , individual masses ( @xmath44 ) , ages ( @xmath45 ) , binarity , and line - of - sight reddening ( a@xmath46 ) , along with the associated uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , these uncertainties should be ` small',when compared to the scales on which the multi - dimensional mean number density of stars @xmath47 } } } , m _ * , { { \\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}}})$ ] has structure . in practice , this is neither achievable in the foreseeable future , nor is it clear that a ` fuller ' sampling of @xmath48 } } } , m _ * , { { \\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}}})$ ] is always worth the additional effort . such an all - encompassing survey would imply that the probability of entering the catalog is @xmath49 } } } , m _ * , { { \\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}}})\\simeq 1 $ ] across the entire relevant domain , @xmath50 , etc . ] of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "any realistic survey is a particular choice of compromise in this parameter space .",
    "fundamentally , @xmath51 of any survey , i.e. , the probability of any given star having ended up in the catalog , is always limited by quantities in the space of ` immediate observables ' , foremost by the stars fluxes ( or signal - to - noise ) vis - a - vis a survey s flux limit or image - crowding limit .",
    "but these immediate observables are usually not the quantities of foremost astrophysical interest , say @xmath52 } } } , m , { { \\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}}}$ ] . while full completeness is practicable with respect to some quantities , e.g. , the angular survey coverage @xmath53 and the velocities @xmath2 , it is not in other respects",
    ". the effective survey volume will always be larger for more luminous stars , the survey s distance limit will always be greater in directions of lower dust extinction at the observed wavelength ; and an all - sky survey at fixed exposure time will go less deep towards the bulge because of crowding .",
    "so , in general , ` completeness ' is an unattainable goal . and while samples that are ` complete ' in some physical quantity such as volume or mass are immediately appealing and promise easy analysis , their actual construction in many surveys comes at the expense of discarding a sizable ( often dominant ) fraction of the pertinent catalog entries . with the right analysis tools , understanding the survey ( in-)completeness , and",
    "its mapping into the physical quantities of interest , is more important than culling ` complete ' samples .",
    "we will return to this in section[sec : selectionfunctions ] . .",
    "the physical attributes about a star ( @xmath52 } } } , m , { { \\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}}}$ ] ) that one would like to have for describing and modeling the disk are in general not direct observables .",
    "this starts out with the fact that the natural coordinates for ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) in the space of observables are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , with a heliocentric reference system in position and velocity .",
    "in general , galactic star surveys fall into two seemingly disjoint categories : imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "imaging surveys get parsed into catalogs that provide angular positions and fluxes ( typically in 2 to 10 passbands ) for discrete sources , once photometric solutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and astrometric solutions @xcite have been obtained .",
    "multi - epoch surveys , or the comparison of different surveys from different epochs then provide proper motions , and  with sufficient precision",

    "spectroscopic surveys of the milky way are always affected by various selection effects , commonly referred to as ` selection biases ' . in their most benign form , these are due to a set of objective and repeatable decisions of what to observe ( necessitated by the survey design ) .",
    "selection biases typically arise in three forms : a ) the survey selection procedure , b ) the relation between the survey stars and the underlying stellar population , and c ) the extrapolation from the observed ( spatial ) volume and the ` global ' milky way volume .",
    "different analyses need not be affected by all three of these biases .    in many existing galactic survey analyses emphasis",
    "has been given  in the initial survey design , the targeting choices and the subsequent sample culling  to getting as simple a selection function as possible , e.g.@xcite .",
    "this then lessens , or even obviates the need to deal with the selection function explicitly in the subsequent astrophysical analysis .",
    "while this is a consistent approach , it appears not viable , or at least far from optimal , for the analyses of the vast data sets that are emerging from the current general purpose surveys . in the context of galactic stellar surveys ,",
    "a more general and rigorous way of guarding against these biases and correcting for them has been laid our perhaps most explicitly and extensively in @xcite , and in the interest of a coherent exposition we focus on this case .",
    "therefore , we use the example of the spectroscopic segue g - dwarf sample used in @xcite  a magnitude - limited , color - selected sample part of a targeted survey of @xmath196 lines of sight at high galactic latitude ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we consider the idealized case that the sample was created using a single @xmath197 color cut from a sample of pre - existing photometry and that objects were identically and uniformly sampled and successfully observed over a magnitude range @xmath198 .",
    "we assume that all selection is performed in dereddened colors and extinction - corrected magnitudes . at face value ,",
    "such a sample suffers from the three biases mentioned in the previous paragraph : a ) the survey selection function ( ssf ) is such that only stars in a limited magnitude range are observed spectroscopically , and this range corresponds to a different distance range for stars of different metallicities ; b ) a @xmath197 color cut selects more abundant , lower - mass stars at lower metallicities , such that different ranges of the underlying stellar population are sampled for different metallicities ; c ) the different distance range for stars of different metallicities combined with different spatial distributions means that different fractions of the total volume occupied by a stellar population are observed .",
    "we assume that a spectroscopic survey is based on a pre - existing photometric catalog , presumed complete to potential spectroscopic targets .",
    "the survey selection procedure can then ideally be summarized by a ) the cuts on the photometric catalog to produce the potential spectroscopic targets , b ) the sampling method , and c ) potential quality cuts for defining a successfully observed spectrum ( for example , a signal - to - noise ratio cut on the spectrum ) .",
    "we will assume that the sampling method is such that targets are selected independently from each other .",
    "if targets are not selected independently from each other ( such as , for example , in systematic sampling techniques where each ` n'-th item in an ordered list is observed ) , then correcting for the ssf  is more complicated . for ease of use of the ssf , spectroscopic targets must be sampled independently from each other .    .",
    "the left panel shows in grayscale the number density of stars with sdss photometry ( presumed to be complete ) within the g - dwarf target selection box in ( @xmath199 ) space ; the contours show the distribution of stars that resulted in successful spectroscopic catalog entries ( the spectroscopic completeness ) , after ` bright ' and ` faint ' plates were taken ( see @xcite ) obviously the distributions differ distinctly , as also the marginalized histograms show .",
    "the right panel shows the fraction of ` available ' g - dwarf targets that were assigned fibers ; clearly that fraction varies dramatically with galactic coordinates.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the top panel of  [ fig : selection - function ] shows the relation between the underlying , complete photometric sample and the spectroscopic sample for the segue g - dwarf sample .",
    "while the sampling in color is close to unbiased , the sampling in @xmath200-band magnitude is strongly biased against faint targets because of the signal - to - noise ratio cut ( @xmath201 in this case ) .    the selection function",
    "can then be expressed as a function @xmath202 of the relevant quantities @xmath203  from the photometric catalog ; this function expresses the relative fraction of entries in the spectroscopic catalog with respect to the complete photometric catalog , as a function of @xmath203 .",
    "we will not concern ourselves here with how this function is derived for the spectroscopic survey in question ; an example is given in appendix a of @xcite and  [ fig : selection - function ] .",
    "we assume that the ssf  is unbiased in velocity space , that is , that all velocities have equal probability of being observed , such that the ssf  only affects analyses concerned with the spatial densities of objects .",
    "if we then want to infer the spatial density in @xmath204 of a set of spectroscopic objects , we need to constrain the joint distribution @xmath205 of @xmath203 , @xmath1 , and whichever other parameters @xmath206  are necessary to relate @xmath1 to @xmath203  ( for example , when photometric distances are used , the metallicity can be used in addition to purely photometric properties to calculate @xmath1 ) ; we denote all arguments of @xmath207 as @xmath208 .",
    "the joint distribution can be written as @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the distribution of @xmath203  and @xmath206  as a function of @xmath1 , and @xmath211 is a jacobian , transforming from the heliocentric frame to the galactocentric one . as discussed in @xcite , the correct likelihood to fit",
    "is @xmath212 where the product is over all spectroscopic data points .",
    "this likelihood simply states that the observed rate is normalized over the volume in @xmath213 space that _ could have been observed within the survey selection constraints as expressed by the ssf_.    for example , in the segue example discussed above , we may further assume for simplicity that the distance is obtained simply as @xmath214 ( that is , ignoring the metallicity , such that there are no @xmath206 ) with no uncertainty . and that the distribution of colors @xmath197 is uniform over the observed color range , then @xmath205 can be written as @xmath215)\\,\\nu_*(\\vec{x})\\,|j|\\,s(r , g - r,\\ell , b)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath216 and @xmath217 are galactic longitude and latitude , respectively ; @xmath218)$ ] is a dirac delta function that expresses the photometric distance .",
    "the likelihood then reduces to @xmath219 where we have assumed that we only want to fit parameters of @xmath220 ( such that the ssf  can be dropped from the numerator ) . for a survey of a limited number of lines of sight such as segue",
    ", the integral over @xmath216 and @xmath217 can be re - written as a sum over the lines of sight .",
    "assuming that the ssf  does not depend on the velocity , fitting a joint distribution function  model for the positions and velocity , for example when fitting dynamical models to data , uses a similar expression , with the density @xmath220 simply getting replaced by the distribution function , and the integral in the denominator in equation  ( [ eq : sflike ] ) includes an additional integration over velocities @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in the context of the simplified segue example , we fit a df  @xmath221 with parameters @xmath222 using the likelihood @xmath223    correcting for selection bias b ) requires stellar - population synthesis models , to connect the number of stars observed in a given color range to the full underlying stellar population .",
    "an example where this correction is performed by calculating the total stellar mass in a stellar population given the number of stars in a given color range is given in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "the total stellar mass is calculated as @xmath224 where @xmath19 is the number of stars and @xmath225 is the average mass in the observed color range , and @xmath226 is the ratio of the total mass of a stellar population to the mass in the observed range .",
    "all of these can be easily calculated from stellar - population synthesis models ( see appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "the correction for bias c ) above involves extrapolating the densities of stars in the observed volume to a ` global ' volume .",
    "this is useful when comparing the total number of stars in the milky way in different components .",
    "for example , @xcite calculated for different maps the total stellar surface density at the solar radius as the ` global ' quantity  also correcting biases a ) and b ) above  extrapolating from the volume observed by segue ( see below ) .",
    "this extrapolation requires the spatial density of each component to calculate the fraction of stars in the observed volume with respect to the ` global ' volume .",
    "correcting for this bias is then as simple as multiplying the number of stars in the observed volume by this factor .",
    "to recall from the introduction , the goals of dynamical modeling in the disk context are two - fold : learn about the gravitational potential , @xmath227 , and learn about the chemo - orbital distribution of disk stars , @xmath30 } } } , { { \\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}}}| \\phi ( { \\vec{x}},t ) \\bigr ) $ ] .",
    "the lengthy , explicit notation makes it clear that we need to evaluate the gravitational potential in light of all the data , and that we need to marginalize over the different @xmath228 to learn about the orbital distribution .",
    "that is , a simultaneous solution for potential and orbits is needed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is a challenge that much of the existing dynamical analyses of the disk have bypassed : when focusing on orbital structure , they have assumed a ` fiducial potential ' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by simplifying the treatment of the orbital structure , e.g. , by the use of the jeans equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or an _ ad hoc _ simplified distribution function . also , basically all dynamical models have focused on steady state models , @xmath229 , or @xmath230 , an assumption that seems wise to retain until comprehensive equilibrium modeling has actually been implemented .",
    "the gravitational potential near the disk has conventionally been characterized separately by the ` rotation curve ' , @xmath231 and by the ` vertical force ' @xmath232 at the solar radius , which describes the surface mass density near the mid - plane , @xmath233 .",
    "good basic estimates for both quantities have been in place for two decades , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , with quoted uncertainties at the @xmath236 to @xmath237 level .",
    "the challenge therefore is to exploit the emerging wealth of data to take this to the next precision level , to obtain analogous constraints over a wider portion of the disk and to eventually make statements about the non-(axi-)symmetric aspects of the potential . at the same time",
    ", one would like to eliminate uncertainties in @xmath40 as a factor in analyzing the stellar orbit ( sub-)structure .",
    "these aspects alone imply that a methodology has to be in place to constrain the potential to @xmath238 .",
    "in addition , one should expect that the ability of data sets to discriminate models grows as @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the number of data points with useful @xmath241 information . by now , @xmath240 has reached @xmath242 , with gaia , it will be @xmath243 : this puts enormous demands on the ` modeling ' if the information content of the data is to be exploited . as even the jeans equation in its simplest ( 1d ) form illustrates , dynamical modeling always involves the link between the gravitational potential , the kinematics of tracers and the ( gradients of the ) spatial density ( @xmath244 ) of tracers , @xmath245 this illustrates the paramount importance of knowing the selection function of any survey , which enters the determination of @xmath246 .",
    "it this context it then also becomes no longer tenable to view the stellar disk in isolation , as the mass contributions from the dark matter and the ism must be taken into account .      to date , the majority of constraints on the galactic potential from disk stars have been derived through the jeans equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; e.g. , @xcite ; see also section  [ sec : recentresultsdynmod ] ) .",
    "this approach has been sensible , because for a relatively cold and thin disk , one has a clear prior on the orbital structure : most orbits should be ` nearly - circular ' , and the deviations from this can be treated as vertical or in - plane oscillations around a guiding center .",
    "however , solving the jeans equations neither delivers a distribution function  for the stars , nor can it provide constraints on @xmath247 _ marginalized _ over the possible distribution functions ; it only can provide a @xmath247-constraint _ conditioned _ on a particular ( yet ill - specified ) distribution function .",
    "hence , more rigorous modeling approaches that explicitly account for the orbit - nature of the stars are needed in the disk context , both given the quality of the data and the subtlety of the questions one would like to address .",
    "mostly in the context of modeling external galaxies or star clusters , three ultimately related approaches have been developed over the last decades .    * methods based on distribution functions : assuming families of analytic distribution functions , for which @xmath248 can be predicted _ in a given potential @xmath40 _  and compared to the data @xmath249 . by varying @xmath40  and finding the distribution function  whose",
    "prediction matches the data in each case , one obtains @xmath250 ; this approach also yields the distribution function , df@xmath251 .",
    "* orbit - based methods : this entails the prediction of @xmath252 by explicit calculation of these orbits ( ` schwarzschild method ' ) , where the best potential is found again by varying @xmath40  and optimizing the ` weights ' of all calculated orbits to match the data . among the advantages of this approach",
    "are that no explicit distribution function  needs to be spelled out , which is difficult to do in , e.g. , non - axisymmetric potentials ; among the disadvantages is that it is difficult to ensure that the distribution function - space has been well - sampled by the discrete orbits .",
    "this approach has been implemented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . * particle - based methods : iteratively modifying a self - consistent @xmath19-body model , so that its predictions increasingly better match a set of given observations ( ` made - to - measure ' ) .",
    "this approach has the advantage that no orbit library needs to be stored and that it makes no explicit symmetry assumptions ; at least in simple cases , it is shown to recover the correct distribution function . however , by its particle nature , its outcome is only one specific particle sampling of the underlying distribution function .",
    "this approach has been originally devised by @xcite , and its practical applications for galaxy modeling have been pursued foremost by gerhard and collaborators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) .",
    "modeling the disk also calls for data vs. model comparisons that differ from those most commonly used in stellar dynamical modeling .",
    "usually , the data - model comparison is presented by comparing the surface - brightness , mean - velocity and velocity dispersion profiles with data that have been binned or never been resolved into individual stars .",
    "the case of the disk , or most other parts of the milky way , is of course different , in at least two respects : first , the data are obtained star - by - star , where each star has uncertainty estimates for each of its phase - space coordinates ; second , our position within the disk means that the direct dynamical observables @xmath253 map into very different components of @xmath254 .",
    "further , the sun s motion with respect to the galactic rest - frame system and with respect to any sensible local co - rotating reference frame ( ` standard of rest ' ) is still under considerable debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this enters into the @xmath255 transformation , finally , the size of the uncertainties in @xmath256 will vary dramatically among sample members , e.g. , if some sample stars have @xmath56 measurements and others do not .",
    "while this calls for an approach beyond comparing tracer density and dispersion profiles , a data - model comparison is still straightforward for any model that predicts @xmath257 , or @xmath258 and @xmath259 , for a given @xmath230 . rather than asking models to match binned moments of the observables , @xmath260 and @xmath261 ,",
    "one simply calculates the likelihood of the individual data @xmath262 , see @xcite .      in light of the vastly better data ,",
    "the recent progress in understanding the dynamical properties of the milky way and the local ( few kpc ) galactic potential may seem disappointing : the debate around the ` circular velocity at @xmath263 ' has not abated , nor have the constrains on the stellar and dm mass distribution near @xmath263 tightened by significant factors . before sketching the road towards comprehensive dynamical modeling ( section  [ sec : witherdisk ] ) , it is worth looking at some of the recent results to describe the status quo , first for @xmath264 then for k@xmath265 .      characterizing the milky way s central mass distribution by its circular velocity has tradition and is ( operationally ) sensible .",
    "for an axisymmetric galaxy , @xmath264 is simply @xmath266 .",
    "the ` rotation curve ' , especially @xmath267 , can be constrained in many different ways : by considering the reflex motion of the galactic center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by measuring the velocities of globular clusters or halos stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , considering them to be a non - rotating component , by measuring line - of - sight or 3d velocities to ism tracers @xcite , presumed to be on near - circular orbits , by determining an overall mass model for the galaxy and its halo and interpolating inferences to @xmath268 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by mapping and modeling the stellar velocities across a sufficiently large portion of the disk @xcite .",
    "over the last years , this has led to ( published ) estimates of @xmath267 , ranging from @xmath269 to @xmath270 , with little seeming progress since the iau recommended a value of @xmath271 , nearly 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "this range of values , given the _ precision _ that the data seemingly can offer , can be traced to the fact a ) that the sun s motion with respect to @xmath272 is uncertain at the @xmath273 level , b ) that the galactic potential is not axisymmetric presumably at the @xmath274 level , and c ) that ( hence ) cold tracers do not move on circular orbits . judging from external galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "fuhrmann s work ) , attributable to an early ( thick disk ) star - formation epoch in the galaxy , and a significantly later thin disk formation epoch , with a star - formation hiatus in between .",
    "because in contrast to that view , @xcite have argued that ( @xmath96}}$]-)abundance bimodality , though no gap , could arise from a perfectly ` smooth ' star - formation and enrichment history .",
    "this is because the @xmath96}}$]-enhancement fades rather rapidly , once sn  ia enrichment becomes important .    at the moment , excellent abundance information over very small volumes tell a somewhat different story about an abundance dichotomy in the stellar disk population than the less precise information on @xmath384 scales .",
    "the next years , providing accurate abundances for large samples over kpc - scales from apogee and gaia - eso should sort this out .    in summary , the authors view  certainly guided and perhaps tainted by their own work ",
    "points towards a structural description of the disk in terms of an approximately continuous distribution of stellar scale - heights or velocity dispersions , which appears inconsistent with a structural thin - thick disk dichotomy or clear bi - modality .",
    "the recent , vastly larger data sets with abundances seem to imply that a thin - thick disk description is too simplistic in , rather than being ` wrong ' . yet , as of this writing , there is no universal acceptance in the community of this view , for understandable reasons : on the one hand , there is a large number of previous results that seem very well explained by a thin - thick disk dichotomy ; while for some of these results , consistency with the continuously varying map   picture has been demonstrated ( see above and cf  [ fig : gilmorereidcomparison ] , and  [ fig : schlesingercomparison ] ) , other previous results still await their comparison with the continuous map   picture . on the other hand ,",
    "the element abundance structure in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath385  pc ) does show clear evidence for abundance - bimodality , with some data sets pointing towards an actual dichotomy .",
    "these have yet to be fully confronted or reconciled with the continuous map   picture .",
    "an currently open question is whether this map  view of the galactic disk provides useful and new constraints on the extensive body of chemical evolution models of the disk that has been developed over the last two decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an exploration of this issues is beyond the scope of this review .    taken together , viewing the disk as a superposition of maps appears as a promising framework for studies ahead , irrespective of the question of a thin - thick dichotomy . in the final section of this review",
    ", we will sketch two aspects where maps are useful , which will bring us to the initial issues , the implications of disk studies for dynamics and galaxy formation .",
    "in the closing section of this review , we now return to the two broad issues laid out in the introduction : first , what steps still need to be taken to understand the 3d gravitational potential near the disk as well as we can , and to draw optimal inferences about the dark matter distribution in the galaxy .",
    "second , how can the empirical description of the disk be linked to galaxy formation mechanisms ? we start by describing emerging approaches towards comprehensive dynamical modeling , followed by illustrative initial comparisons of the disk structure to cosmological simulations in the frame - work of maps .",
    "we end with our best guess of what the conceptual and practical modeling and interpretation challenges are in the gaia era .",
    "approaches to stringent dynamical modeling of the disk , which are going beyond the modeling frameworks described , have also greatly progressed foremost owing to j. binney and p. mcmillan . yet , all the elements still have not yet quite come together to address : what are the best quantitative constraints on the galactic potential and on the disk s distribution functionone can derive from the available , or soon available , data ? neither is there a stringent tool for experiment forecasting to address what pieces of observational data are most informative on a given dynamical questions .",
    "these questions require models that are both _ global _ , _ dynamically consistent _ , and can predict the likelihood of diverse data sets .",
    "the following section reflects not only the authors thoughts and attempts for a roadmap towards such a modeling machinery , but extensively draws on the work and plans laid out eloquently by binney and mcmillan ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) :    * given the complexity of the problem , fully dynamically self - consistent models should be implemented in the steady - state , axisymmetric regime first , before proceeding to non - axisymmetric , time - dependent disk modeling . that alone would provide enormous progress over the status quo .",
    "the limitations of such modeling can be straightforwardly tested against mock - data from numerical disk simulations , which have now reached high - enough resolution(@xmath386 million particles , e.g. , @xcite ) . *",
    "given the vast number of discrete observational constraints , model predictions need to be continuous in @xmath387 , to directly calculate the likelihood for ( discrete ) data .",
    "this argues for a ` distribution function based ' approach , rather than a discrete particle or orbit based representation of the distribution function . * to make the joint optimization , or sampling , of @xmath40  and distribution function  in light of large data sets practical , both @xmath40  and distribution function  should be describable by a modest number of parameters . for the gravitational potential this leaves two options : either describe the potential by a number of discrete , traditional components , such as the bulge , bar , halo , thin disk , thick disk and gaseous disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as the mono - abundance analysis of bovy et  al",
    "( 2012b , c , d ) indicates that a sub - division into a few discrete disk components is not sensible , a description of @xmath40  in terms of two parameterized ` components ' , a spheroidal ( not spherical ) one and a flat , disk - like component , with flexibility in their @xmath200 , and @xmath388 profiles , seems like a more sensible starting point .",
    "* the family of distribution functions advocated by @xcite , which is cast in terms of actions appears as a conceptually attractive and now also practical approach .",
    "specifically , a distribution functioncast in terms of the radial , azimuthal and vertical actions @xmath389 of the form @xmath390\\\\ & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\times \\biggl [ \\frac{\\kappa(l_z)}{d_r(l_z)}\\exp\\bigl ( -\\frac{\\nu(l_z)j_z}{d_r(l_z)}\\bigr ) \\biggr ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] seems like a sensible choice @xcite , where @xmath391 is a set of parameters to describe the distribution function .",
    "elements of @xmath391 in this case are @xmath392 , @xmath393 , and @xmath394 @xcite .",
    "overall @xmath395 sets the radial profile of the disk , given @xmath40 ; @xmath393 and @xmath394 set the radius - dependent disk ` temperature ' in the radial and vertical direction .",
    "@xcite showed that these distribution function  families can reproduce the radial and vertical properties of mono - abundance disk populations well , demonstrating that suitable simply - parameterized families of distribution functions are available .",
    "+ while action - based distribution functions are easy and elegant to write down , community acceptance seems to have been hampered by their reputation to be hard ( or slow ) to calculate , beyond the ` azimuthal action ' , @xmath396 , which is the angular momentum .",
    "recent progress in calculating and testing the accuracy of approximate actions @xcite should help overcome this issue . * ` modeling ' requires efficient computation of @xmath397 , given @xmath40 .",
    "clearly , @xmath398 is easier to calculate , as this does not involve explicit treatment of the orbital _",
    "angles _ that complement the _ actions _ ; in steady - state modeling , the _ angles _ are assumed to be distributed uniformly .",
    "this argues for modeling approaches that only go computationally from configuration to action space . *",
    "yet , models need to be evaluated against data in the ` configuration space ' of observable data , i.e. , we have to determine @xmath399 , with @xmath400}}},{\\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}})\\}_i$ ] .",
    "this will then inform us about the potential after marginalizing over the distribution function  parameters , @xmath401 ; or about the distribution function  after marginalizing over @xmath40 , @xmath402 . * to calculate meaningful likelihoods of the data for different @xmath403 given @xmath404 , it is necessary to interpret the distribution function  as a probability distribution .",
    "this is where in this context the spatial sample selection functions come in ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one approach to incorporating it @xcite ) is to ` normalize ' the distribution function  over the observable volume , @xmath405 , where + @xmath406 * of course , the ` data ' , @xmath407}}},{\\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}})\\}_i$ ] are not precise points in @xmath408 , but have uncertainties , or may even be missing in some dimensions . in practice , this implies yet another marginalization over the data s uncertainties , i.e. , an integral over @xmath409}}},\\delta{\\ensuremath{t_{\\mathrm{age}}}}$ ] . how to do this computationally efficiently and well enough , is yet to be clarified . *",
    "all of the observables of course depend on the sun s position and motion , where the aspects of the observed velocities that simply are the sun s reflex motion are a notorious source of uncertainty . as recent",
    "work has showed , the ` local standard of rest ' is still under extensive debate : as @xcite showed , the sun s motion should also be an explicit model parameter .",
    "* any modeling should exploit the measured chemical abundances as ` integrals of motion ' that separate sub - populations .",
    "in essence , the above procedure should hold for any map , with a distinct distribution function  for each , but of course the same @xmath40  for all . by adding the likelihood contributions from all the map s , inferences about @xmath40  should be straightforward . * finally , the dynamics of the disk do not care about the particulars of the various surveys described in section  [ sec : currentdisksurveys ] , which offer observational constraints in different @xmath54 regimes .",
    "hence models need to be fit simultaneously to data from different surveys , which has happened far too little to date . again , this should be straightforward , as any given model ( distribution function , @xmath40 ) can predict the likelihoods for any survey , and data ( log-)likelihoods simply have to be added .",
    "the practical difficulties lie in the tedious task of compiling the various sample selection functions .    as of now",
    ", only initial demonstrations of theses approaches exist , retrieving information from pseudo - data : @xcite showed how well the distribution functions of ensembles of 5000 stars could be retrieved , if a priori disjoint thin and thick disk components were presumed .",
    "@xcite explored how well the parameters of a simplified 3d model for the galactic potential could be retrieved , with mock - survey data that resemble sdss / segue g - dwarfs ; they could show that the _ shape _ of the potential could be constrained , but that such constraints are much harder to get than constraints on , say , @xmath277 .",
    "overall , the above roadmap shows that basically all elements are in place to do such comprehensive modeling .",
    "this suggest that much more can and will be learned about the galactic potential , drawing on existing data well before the first extensive gaia releases , even if those stay on their 2012 schedule",
    ". this should provide us with a much firmer picture of @xmath40  for the disk and with a solid base - line distribution function description of the disk .",
    "a distribution function  description of the disk and its maps will also provide a much more sensible basis to characterize deviations from it as _  sub - structure\"_. note that sub - structure can be both ` clumps ' in action - space as well as in angle space , an aspect that has yet to be explored .",
    "a second avenue for the near future is to place the emerging empirical results about the disk in the context of galaxy formation .",
    "here we outline what we deem to be a promising approach , looking at maps in cosmological disk formation simulations . as laid out in section  [ sec : diskresults ] , an empirical picture seems to emerge in which the disk is ` seen ' to exhibit an age - sequence from ` thick ' ( large @xmath334 ) and centrally - concentrated ( small @xmath344 ) maps to thin and radially - extended ones , _ if _ @xmath96}}$ ] and @xmath82}}$ ] can indeed provide an approximate relative age ranking of maps in the disk .    in two ways ,",
    "this picture qualitatively resonates with well established concepts of galaxy formation .",
    "one the one hand , disk galaxy formation should proceed from the inside out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , there are several reasons why older components of the disk should be thicker ( or have higher velocity dispersion ) : they may have been born with higher dispersion @xcite , they may have been heated by subsequent tidal interactions or satellite infall ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; outward radial migration appears to conserve approximately the vertical action ( not the vertical energy , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which will slightly thicken the disk portions that have migrated outward _ and _ slightly decrease their vertical velocity @xcite .          to push a comparison with expectations in the cosmological context further ,",
    "predictions of galaxy formation simulations for maps are needed . as described in section  [ sec : diskoverview ] , disk galaxy formation simulations have made enormous strides in producing outcomes that resemble milky way like galaxies @xcite , with dominant flat disks and only a modest fraction of the stars in a central bulge .",
    "some of these simulations also treat the chemical enrichment self - consistently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and these simulations provide an initial , at least qualitative , comparison of maps between cosmological simulations and direct milky way observations .",
    "recently , @xcite has carried out such a comparison with the patterns found by @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : stinson2012a ] , they found remarkable agreement .",
    "this figure shows edge - on views of the present - day stellar density distribution in the simulations , sorted according to the @xmath410 $ ] ( as proxy for @xmath96}}$ ] ) . as observed in the disk , there is a sequence of centrally - compact and thick configurations at the @xmath410$]-enhanced end to radially - extended , thin distributions at solar @xmath410 $ ] values . quantifying this picture by plotting @xmath334 vs. @xmath344 for maps in the simulations ,",
    "confirms that this simulation shows the same behavior as the data .",
    "this agreement lends encouragement to query the simulations about the extent to which mono - abundance populations can serve as proxy for mono - age populations .",
    "figure  [ fig : stinson2012b ] shows the mean age and the age dispersion as a function of @xmath82}}$ ] and @xmath96}}$ ] in the simulations .",
    "remarkably , in most mono - abundance bins of these simulations , the age dispersion is @xmath411 , justifying the use of 2d - abundances as age proxies .    of course , at present the above is only an anecdotal comparison with one simulation ; albeit a state - of - the - art simulation that was ` tuned ' to match the stellar - mass / halo - mass relation of @xcite at redshift zero , and that produces a large , fairly massive disk and a small bulge , with the spatial and temporal abundance pattern only a consequence of it .",
    "clearly , this kind of data model comparison warrant much further exploration , as we lay out in the final subsection .",
    "some readers may pine for ` tests ' of galaxy evolution mechanism that do not depend on comparison with numerical simulations .",
    "but such tests may be far and few between , as the present - day dynamical structure mostly tells us about the present day .",
    "this can be illustrated by the quest to find tests for the efficacy of radial migration .",
    "the hermes / galah experiment @xcite has set out to provide such a clean test : the ambition is to identify , through ` abundance fingerprinting ' , stars that were formed basically at the same time with the same orbital actions and phases .",
    "if we can look at their orbits ( say angular momenta ) now , and if we know their ages , then one gets a direct estimate of the importance of radial migration , though still no clear hint about the cause of that migration ( bars , spiral arms , satellites , etc . ) .      the galactic stellar disk , as defined here ,",
    "does of course not live in isolation , but it interfaces with other galactic ` components ' at its extremes : with the bar and ( pseudo-)bulge at small radii ; with the slightly warped , complex , and almost messy outer reaches of the disk ( @xmath412 ) ; and with the galactic stellar halo , which the data suggest is truly a ` distinct ' component from the bulk of the disk @xcite .",
    "we review only briefly the status and prospects in these areas .    *",
    "* the innermost disk : * massive late - type galaxies like ours often have bars at the center @xcite and a thick central portion that is described as a pseudo - bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the milky way fits that pattern , as it has a large - scale stellar bar @xcite .",
    "this bar must have formed from stars that were part of the pre - existing disk , and clear separation between the components is perhaps moot ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice ,",
    "the present end of the bar is a sensible dividing line , presumably at co - rotation @xmath413 @xcite .",
    "as the patterns speeds of bars change secularly @xcite , it is unclear  and should be clarified  whether this radius implies any changes in the abundance or age structure . * * the outer fringes of the disk : * the stellar disk of our neighbor galaxy , m31 , is manifestly frayed in its very outer parts @xcite , possibly because much of the material is tidally disrupted satellite debris or possibly because disk material has been grossly perturbed by such infall events .",
    "there is ample evidence that the outer parts of the galactic disk are just as messy : the structure variously known as the ` anticenter ring ' , ` monoceros ring ' , ` canis major feature ' @xcite reflects the fact that there are far more stars at @xmath414 to @xmath415 @xcite with @xmath416  kpc than a simple double exponential disk model suggests .",
    "this ` feature ' of the outer disk has elicited extensive discussion , as two very different ( and in the pure form probably simplistic ) explanations have been advanced to explain it : either purely as deposited stellar debris from a satellite that had merged on a low - latitude , low - eccentricity prograde orbit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or simply as a combination of a disk warp and flare ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because the abundance distribution and kinematics of possible ` monoceros ring ' member stars are not grossly different from the expectations for an outer disk , it will take comprehensive area coverage ( e.g. , from ps1 ) , good distances from gaia , and extensive spectroscopy ( 1000 s of stars ) yielding velocities and abundances to sort out to which extent these are stars that have been ` dragged into ' the disk vs. ` kicked out of ' the disk .",
    "having described the various elements of gathering , analyzing and ( dynamically and cosmologically ) modeling stellar disk surveys , we now try to cast answering some of introductory questions in this review into possible projects that appear feasible and necessary for the next years :      with the modeling machinery of section  [ sec : comprehensiveapproachdynmod ] in place , at least in principle , all elements have come together to answer this question .",
    "the most straightforward approach to doing this is to create mock data sets from @xmath19-body simulations of disks that are self - consistent by construction , and feed them though the modeling machinery to see how well @xmath40  and distribution function  can be recovered .",
    "recently , non - cosmological simulations of disk galaxies have reached particle sizes of @xmath417 million particles @xcite , where mock - data sets that match the current generation of survey data ( rave , sdss , apogee , etc . ) can be drawn directly without supersampling .",
    "then selection functions , distance estimates with either random or systematic errors , and ( appropriate or inappropriate ) de - reddening estimates can be applied , where the reddening model would be a version of the currently emerging 3d extinction maps for the milky way ( cf . section  [ sec : extinction ] ) . deriving probability distribution functions on @xmath40  in light of a suite of mock data sets , would reveal the factors that limit the accuracy of the potential inference .",
    "similar , or even the same , mock - data sets can explore to which extent non - axisymmetry of disk galaxies such as the milky way , in particular spiral arms and a central bar , would affect the @xmath40  inferences made under axisymmetric assumptions . in turn , with such analyses one can explore what it would take to , e.g. , measure the strength of the spiral arms dynamically .",
    "what the mock data , at least in the very high resolution , hence ` non - cosmological ' simulations , do not easily supply is an ` abundance tag ' that allows to define maps .",
    "hence , the best way to test how much is gained in _ dynamical _ analyses by splitting the tracer samples into maps still needs to be devised .",
    "current experiments along those lines @xcite indicate that the sheer sample size plays a sub - dominant role in constraining the potential in the current regime ( @xmath418  stars ) .",
    "such mock data sets will also be crucial in finding out whether vast numbers of stars with partial phase - space information ( e.g. , without @xmath419 ) have comparable information content than far smaller sets with complete phase - space information .      in the context of comprehensive dynamical modeling ( section  [ sec : comprehensiveapproachdynmod ] ) , an estimate of the distribution function  of course results ` automatically ' . yet , the issues of getting an optimal estimate for distribution function  are different . on the one hand ,",
    "slight systematic errors in @xmath40  probably lead to a ( smooth ) distribution function  that looks very similar to the correct one ; so to get a sense of whether the vertical action distribution of maps varies little with radius ( as expected for asymptotically - efficient radial migration ) , an approximate potential probably suffices .",
    "on the other hand , it is perhaps distribution function  sub - structure or fine - scale structure that is most interesting . in the limit of a ` cold stellar stream ' , i.e. , stars of the same actions that differ only in phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , the most plausible potential may be the one that makes the distribution function  of that stream most like a @xmath420-function , even if that potential is not necessarily the most likely in light of the overall set of tracers .",
    "further , sample size , precision of the individual @xmath241 estimates , and chemical abundances matter far more than for merely estimating @xmath40 .",
    "sample size matters , because diagnostically precious sub - populations ( e.g. , streams ) may only make up a very small fraction of the disk mass ; @xmath41-precision matters , because ` cold ' substructures , those very compact in distribution function  space , are of preeminent interest , and @xmath33}}}$ ] matters , because the distribution function  has to be strictly separable in chemical abundances , which resemble effective separating integrals of motion .",
    "therefore , even with only an initial estimate of distribution function , a full exploration of map  distribution functions , with the largest possible samples and the most precise phase - space coordinate estimates will be the next step .",
    "this is clearly also a direction where dramatic progress using gaia data will be very straightforward .",
    "initial attempts have been made to bring the diverse constraints on the galactic gravitational potential on the same footing @xcite , the outer halo constraints , the rotation curve , and the local dark matter estimates from @xmath303 .",
    "but the step of measuring @xmath303 as a function of @xmath421 , which is feasible even with the existing data from @xmath422 to @xmath423 , is currently missing . getting the dynamically - measured disk mass scale length ( presumably over 2 to 3 scale lengths , i.e. , an order of magnitude in @xmath424 ) will break the ` disk  halo degeneracy ' and allow us to take strides towards better quantifying the amount of dark matter within @xmath263 . in constraining the rotation curve",
    ", the emerging stellar surveys will eventually allow for testing less constrained models , and the combination of stellar kinematics with good distances and the emerging results from the galactic maser survey @xcite will be the most powerful constraints on global asymmetries of the galactic potential , such a lopsidedness .",
    "this is because masers are the most feasible tracer of the rotation curve on the far side of the galaxy . untangling the disk and halo contributions to the potential at @xmath425",
    "will then permit tighter constraints on the shape of the dark matter and  ultimately  a test for the existence of dark matter ( as opposed to alternative gravity laws ) on the bases of the shape of the acceleration / potential map alone ; such analyses probably require gaia data , foremost to get very good proper motions to @xmath426 .      in summary ,",
    "an enormous amount of practical work needs to be carried out and conceptual modeling issues need to be sorted out , even before gaia data are available .",
    "it seems crucial to do this work , even if some aspects ( but clearly not all  abundances , radial velocities of faint stars ) will be dramatically superseded by gaia .",
    "this is because the currently emerging data will be key in making sure we are asking the right questions of the gaia data , and think through what the most critical ` complementary data ' to esa s next flagship mission are . in return",
    ", the field promises a information revolution that is probably unmatched in the field of galaxy studies in this decade , alma and jwst notwithstanding .",
    "but the attentive and persistent reader will have noticed that we have not fully closed the circle on using the galactic disk to test ` mechanisms of disk galaxy formation ' . while section  [ sec : map_in_galform ] has sketched some specific examples of how to test aspects of disk galaxy formation by comparing ab initio simulations to the data , it has not tackled head - on some of the broad initial questions ( section  [ sec : formevdisk ] ) : to which extent where stars born ( vertically ) hot or subsequently heated ?",
    "is there testable evidence that the feedback implemented in the simulations actually took place ?",
    "can we recognize stellar satellite debris well enough to quantify the fraction of disk stars with external origin ?",
    "that means that also much conceptual work needs to be done .",
    "it may serve as a useful compass to thoroughly think about the following scenario : if one had the perfectly ` analyzed and modeled ' gaia data ( and those from all other surveys ) at hand , what are the crispest inferences one could draw about how our galaxy and other disk galaxies , have formed ?    * acknowledgements * it is a pleasure to thank vardan adibekyan , dan foreman - mackey , ralph schnrich and david w. hogg for helpful comments and assistance .",

    "<S> a suite of vast stellar surveys mapping the milky way , culminating in the gaia mission , is revolutionizing the empirical information about the distribution and properties of stars in the galactic stellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> we review and lay out what analysis and modeling machinery needs to be in place to test mechanism of disk galaxy evolution and to stringently constrain the galactic gravitational potential , using such galactic star - by - star measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we stress the crucial role of stellar survey selection functions in any such modeling ; and we advocate the utility of viewing the galactic stellar disk as made up from ` mono - abundance populations ' ( maps ) , both for dynamical modeling and for constraining the milky way s evolutionary processes . </S>",
    "<S> we review recent work on the spatial and kinematical distribution of maps , and lay out how further study of maps in the gaia era should lead to a decisively clearer picture of the milky way s dark matter distribution and formation history .    </S>",
