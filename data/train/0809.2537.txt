    "the transitions between ordered and disordered phases may be continuous or of first - order with a tricritical point between them .",
    "the exactly soluble ising model in @xmath5  @xcite with the addition of next - nearest - neighbor interactions becomes an analytically intractable problem and an understanding of the effects of adding such further couplings on the critical behavior of the system is an open important problem of great theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "we will be particularly interested is cases involving competing interactions with ground - state arrangements that mimic a sublattice order or superantiferromagnetic ( saf ) order in which ferromagnetic lines along the directions of the lattice alternate with lines of opposite oriented spins .",
    "such models are of great theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "they simulate various types of antiferromagnets  @xcite , but also important models of alloy orderings  @xcite . due to the well - known correspondence between spin systems and lattice gas ,",
    "they provide an understanding of the behavior of adsorbed gases on crystal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that , remarkable efforts have been made to predict the order of the transition according to the landau - lifshitz rules , which , on the basis of group theory arguments , select the ordered configurations that can be reached from the disordered phase by a continuous transition  @xcite .",
    "k. binder  @xcite has reviewed these rules and has also pointed out well - known counter - examples , emphasizing the experimental difficulties in distinguishing a weak first - order transition from a second - order transition .",
    "second - order transitions are more special than first - order transitions , but they are theoretically much better understood . at a first - order transition",
    "there is no diverging correlation length , and in general one can not restrict attention to long wavelength phenomena , thus no universality , as in critical phenomena , is to be expected .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that antiferromagnetic arrangements , with several order - parameter components , may be produced by the competition of the interactions  @xcite . however , no general theoretical agreement exists connecting the symmetry of spin structures , the number of order - parameter components , and the range of interaction with the expected critical behavior and in particular the order of the phase transition .",

    "rastelli et al .",
    "@xcite have recently presented numerical evidence ( for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) that , in the thermodynamic limit , this model undergoes a first - order phase transition , from a layered ordered phase ( saf phase ) to a high temperature paramagnetic phase . here",
    ", we will present a more detailed identification of the nature of this transition by looking again at the size dependence of the traditional thermodynamic quantities but also by implementing the lee - kostelirlitz method  @xcite and detecting the first - order character of the transition via the size - dependence of the free energy barrier .",

    "@xcite and try to verify the predictions of the finite - size scaling ( fss ) theory of first - order transitions , including transition point shifts , thermal , and magnetic anomalies .",
    "the theory of fss near second - order transitions has a rich and longstanding literature  @xcite , starting with the pioneering works of fisher  @xcite and fisher and barber  @xcite .",
    "this theory has been extended to first - order transitions  @xcite and fss and renormalization group methods have proven to be very useful tools for the study of first- and second - order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "our attempt here to elucidate the distinctive first - order features of the present model , by an extensive numerical study , will closely follow previous analogous studies carried out on the @xmath8 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 potts model  @xcite . in these studies",
    "the existing theories of first - order transitions have been tested and verified but several important aspects have not been thoroughly clarified , especially in the cases of weak first - order transitions .",
    "not only the demonstration of a weak first - order transition is more difficult but also strong finite - size effects may obscure the true asymptotic behavior  @xcite and some theoretical predictions may not be met even at quite large lattices ( since the correlation length may be very large ) . in such cases , it is very difficult to discriminate between wrong phenomenological expectations and correct theoretical predictions .",
    "therefore , comparisons of different models and alternative studies may provide useful information and a better understanding of finite - size effects , something that is necessary for the correct interpretation of the numerical data and the verification of the theories .",
    "the present model , showing a weak first - order phase transition , offers the opportunity of such a contrasting test with the well - studied cases of the potts model .",
    "our interest in the present model stems from our recent studies on the analogous square saf model  @xcite , which is again an ising model on the square lattice with nearest - neighbor ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the ground state of the square saf model is four - fold degenerate and consists of the arrangements in which ferromagnetic rows ( columns ) alternate with opposite oriented spins . in the square model",
    "the saf order can be obtained in both cases of a ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor coupling ( for its @xmath15 phase diagram see refs .",
    "similarly , the present triangular saf model , with antiferromagnetic interactions in ratio @xmath2 , has a six - fold degenerate ground state and consists of the six arrangements in which ferromagnetic lines alternate with opposite oriented spins in the three lattice directions ( @xmath15 phase diagrams are given in refs .",
    "the hamiltonian that governs these systems , in zero - field , is @xmath16 where here both nearest - neighbor ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) interactions will be assumed to be positive ( antiferromagnetic ) . this hamiltonian has been studied also in @xmath17 fcc lattices and evidence for both first- and second - order phase transitions have been presented  @xcite , although the distinction of the order of the transition was difficult in that case too .    the square model , governed by eq .  ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    ", develops at low temperatures saf order for @xmath18 and several early studies  @xcite , mainly based on importance sampling  @xcite , have suggested that this system possess anomalous exponents and a non - universal critical behavior with exponents depending on the coupling ratio @xmath19 .",
    "however , despite this early accepted scenario , there has been recently renewed interest and some attempts to re - examine the behavior of this model appeared . in several papers",
    "lopez et al .",
    "@xcite have used the cluster variation method ( cvm ) to study this model , concluding that the system undergoes a first - order transition for a particular range of the coupling ratio @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . on the other hand , this different scenario - predicting first - order transitions between ordered and disordered phases followed by continuous transitions outside the first - order region - has now been seriously questioned by the present authors , who have presented very strong evidence  @xcite for the case @xmath21 that points out a well - obeyed second - order scaling behavior .",
    "the buzano and pretti  @xcite attempt to verify the scenario of lopez et al .",
    "@xcite , by including an additional @xmath22-body coupling , and using again the cvm , has revealed a further peculiar inadequacy of the cvm .",
    "the limiting case ( @xmath23 ) , where the exact solution of the baxter model  @xcite applies , was also predicted by the cvm to undergo a first - order transition , in contradiction to the exact solution .",
    "the above introduction describes a rather controversial situation on the class of models with antiferromagnetic ground - state arrangements .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to follow closely the previous fss analysis applied to the potts models and study in more detail the triangular saf model . in this case",
    ", we will insist that this system undergoes a genuine , but weak , first - order transition , as originally predicted by rastelli et al .",

    "this model will be shown to produce first - order characteristics that lie between the @xmath8 and @xmath24 potts model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we outline an extensive entropic sampling program .",
    "this program goes beyond our previous practice in other applications  @xcite and is based on ( i ) the wang - landau ( wl ) method  @xcite , ( ii ) our dominant energy restriction ( crmes ) scheme  @xcite , and ( iii ) a second - stage improvement that combines the wl  @xcite , the lee entropic  @xcite , and the broad histogram ( bh )  @xcite or transition matrix  @xcite methods . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we shall review all necessary theoretical aspects of first - order transitions that are then used for the analysis of our numerical data .",
    "the free energy barrier method of lee and kosterlitz  @xcite , used in the literature for the identification of a first - order transition , is discussed in subsection  [ sec:3aa ] , while the size - dependence of thermal properties derived from the well - known double gaussian approximation is summarized in subsection  [ sec:3b ] .",
    "finally , some new transition points derived from the number - of - phases parameter  @xcite are presented in subsection  [ sec:3c ] .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] presents the analysis of our numerical data . in subsection  [ sec:4a ]",
    "we make use of several alternative methods for the estimation of the transition temperature presenting a detailed analysis of the new transition points derived from the number - of - phases parameter and a discussion on their conjectured exponentially small shift behavior . in subsection  [ sec:4b ]",
    "we explore our data for the energy cumulants and the magnetic susceptibility , emphasizing on the examination of the higher - order corrections predicted by the double gaussian approximation .",
    "the characteristic values of the energy cumulants , i.e. the coefficient of the dominant diverging term of the specific heat and the limiting values of the second- and fourth - order energy cumulants are determined and the corresponding theoretical predictions are critically discussed .",
    "this serves as a useful self - consistency test of our numerical data but also of the theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "computer simulations based on monte carlo sampling methods have increased dramatically our understanding of the behavior of systems of classical statistical mechanics . the metropolis method and its variants were for many years the main tools in condensed matter physics and critical phenomena  @xcite . however , for complex systems , effective potentials may have competing minima , or a rugged landscape , becoming more pronounced with increasing system size . in such cases ,",
    "the traditional methods become completely inefficient , since they can not overcome such barriers and cross from one basin to another in the state space . on the other hand , a large number of `` generalized ensemble '' methods have been proposed to overcome such troubles  @xcite . one important class of these methods emphasizes the idea of directly sampling the energy density of states ( dos ) and may be called entropic sampling methods  @xcite . in an enropic sampling method , instead of sampling microstates with probability proportional to @xmath25 , we sample microstates with probability proportional to @xmath26^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath27 is the dos , thus producing a `` flat energy histogram '' . the prerequisite for the implementation of the method ,",
    "is the dos information of the system , a problem that can now be handled in many adequate ways . over the last two decades",
    ", there have been a number of interesting approaches addressing this problem .",
    "the most remarkable examples are the lee entropic  @xcite , the multicanonical  @xcite , the bh  @xcite , the transition matrix  @xcite , and the wl  @xcite methods .",
    "in particular , the wl algorithm  @xcite has been one of the most refreshing improvements in monte carlo simulation schemes and has been already applied to a broad spectrum of interesting problems in statistical mechanics and biophysics  @xcite .",
    "recently , the present authors have introduced  @xcite a dominant energy subspace implementation of the above entropic methods , called critical minimum energy subspace ( crmes ) method .",
    "the main idea is a systematic restriction of the energy space with increasing lattice size .",
    "the ( wl ) random walk takes place in the appropriately restricted energy space and this restriction produces an immense speed up without introducing observable errors .",
    "for the temperature range of interest , that is the range around a critical or , for the present model , a first - order transition point , this scheme may be used to determine all finite - size thermal anomalies from the final accurate dos of the wl scheme . a further simplification , for the determination of the magnetic finite - size anomalies ,",
    "was suggested  @xcite by using the wl approach as a one - run entropic strategy . in this",
    "crmes wl - entropic sampling method the magnetic properties are obtained by recording appropriate histograms in the high levels ( or final levels ) of the wl process .",
    "it was argued and numerically verified that these high levels , in which the detailed balanced condition is quite well satisfied , give good approximations for the microcanonical estimators , necessary for the evaluation of other properties , besides the thermal ones , of the statistical system .",
    "the method was efficiently combined with the n - fold way  @xcite in order to improve statistical reliability , but also to produce bh estimators , from the same high levels , for an additional calculation of the dos .",
    "let us now outline the main ingredients and equations used in the above described implementation .",
    "the approximation of canonical averages , in a temperature range of interest , is as follows : @xmath28 the restricted energy subspace @xmath29 is carefully chosen to cover the temperature range of interest without introducing observable errors .",
    "the microcanonical averages @xmath30 are determined from the @xmath31-histograms ( denoted by @xmath32 ) , which are obtained during the high levels of the wl process @xmath33 and the summations run over all values generated in the restricted energy subspace @xmath29 . finally , the approximate dos used in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is the final `` most accurate '' dos generated via the wl iteration @xmath34 $ ] or alternatively from the accumulated bh approximation @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the initial modification factor of the wl process is taken to be @xmath36 and , as usual , we follow the rule @xmath37 and a @xmath38 flatness criterion  @xcite .",
    "details on the n - fold implementation can be found in refs .",
    "as mentioned above , the recording of the appropriate histograms takes place in the high levels ( @xmath39 ) of the wl process , where the incomplete detailed balance condition has no significant effects .",
    "the crmes restriction may be defined by requesting a specified accuracy on a diverging specific heat ( and/or on a diverging susceptibility )  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the energy density function may be used to restrict the energy space .",
    "this latter restriction is very simple for presentation reasons ( see below ) but we always use the original recursion method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which from our experience produces the most accurate and safe location of the dominant energy subspace .",
    "consider a temperature of interest @xmath40 and let @xmath41 be the value maximizing the probability density , at this temperature .",
    "the end - points @xmath42 of the dominant energy subspaces may be located by the above mentioned simple energy density function condition @xmath43 where @xmath44 is chosen to be a small number , independent of the lattice size ( i.e. @xmath45 ) .",
    "similarly , let @xmath46 be the value maximizing the order - parameter density at some pseudocritical temperature , for instance the pseudocritical temperature of the susceptibility @xmath47 .",
    "then , the end - points @xmath48 of the dominant magnetic subspaces may be located by a similar condition @xmath49 the finite - size extensions of the above dominant energy and order - parameter subspaces satisfy respectively the scaling laws of the specific heat and susceptibility with exponents @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively  @xcite .    the performance limitations of entropic methods , such as the wl random walk and the reduction of their statistical fluctuations have recently attracted considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "for the crmes entropic scheme , presented above , comparative studies using various implementations and the metropolis algorithm were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath5 and @xmath17 ising models and also in refs .",
    "@xcite for the square saf model .",
    "in particular , the effects of the used range of the wl iteration levels on the magnetic properties of the system and also the effect of some refinements of the wl algorithm were discussed . however , for large systems statistical fluctuations significantly increase and their reduction demands , as usually , multiple measurements , i.e. carrying out many wl random walks .",
    "the recordings of the @xmath31-histograms in the high levels of the wl iteration process will in general produce quite accurate estimates for the magnetic or other properties , but it should be noted that this accuracy may well depend on the lattice sizes used but also on the particular model simulated . from our experience , all ingredients of the entropic schemes should be tested and treated with caution .",
    "there are , for instance , several ideas in the literature for reducing the modification factor of the wl process but also for the proper use , i.e. recording enough statistics , of the histogram - flatness criterion of the wl method  @xcite .",
    "taking all these into account , we first applied a multi - energy - range approach  @xcite using the one - run entropic scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , recording the @xmath52-histograms only in the final levels @xmath39 of the wl process .",
    "for all lattice sizes ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) this simulation was repeated for @xmath53 independent random walks and averages of the resulting dos and histograms were constructed .",
    "these time - demanding simulations have been greatly facilitated by the dominant energy subspace restriction applied . even by using an @xmath45 accuracy level , we had to simulate only a small part of the order of @xmath54 of the energy spectrum for the larger lattices .",
    "for @xmath55 we determined the dos for about @xmath56 energy levels ( @xmath57 ) , which is about @xmath58 wider than the resulting dominant subspace of @xmath59 energy levels .",
    "for @xmath60 we carried out the simulation in a subspace of @xmath61 energy levels ( @xmath62 ) and the resulting dominant subspace was about @xmath63 energy levels ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "these numerical data were used to observe the first - order nature of the present model and in fact the resulting evidence was decisively supporting the first - order character of the transition ( note that figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] in the next section are using also these data ) .",
    "however , due to the first - order character the statistical fluctuations for the present model were rather large , compared to other simpler models studied earlier by the same scheme  @xcite .",
    "accordingly we have carried out a second - stage entropic sampling scheme only for the lattices @xmath65 . in this scheme",
    "we performed two parallel random walks , one using the @xmath66 modification factor of the wl method ( wl - walk ) and the other using the lee correction  @xcite of the dos ( lee - walk ) .",
    "the total duration of this process was set equal to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the time needed in the original scheme for the saturation of histogram fluctuations  @xcite of the wl scheme at the level @xmath66 .",
    "details of these additional simulations are given below .",
    "the second - stage simulation was repeated three times for each lattice size , every time starting with a different dos , selected from our first one - run approach . in time intervals equal to the time - unit @xmath68 ,",
    "the resulting dos s from the two parallel walks ( wl - walk and lee - walk ) were recorded , as were also recorded the corresponding `` microcanonical estimators '' for the application of the bh or transition matrix methods . to continue in the next time - step ( of duration @xmath68 )",
    "we used for both parallel walks the time - accumulated average dos of the lee - walk .",
    "of course , this practice is one of many other possibilities and ideas for `` refreshing '' the dos , that could be used to continue the further refinement of the dos via a wl - modification ( @xmath66 ) or via a lee - adjustment  @xcite .",
    "one can even mix the dos s of the two parallel walks and/or combine with the dos s resulting from the bh or transition matrix methods to continue the process ( such an example was considered by shell et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the end of the process",
    ", we have observed the time development of various thermal properties of the system at some convenient temperatures , for instance the specific heat and fourth - order cumulant pseudotransition temperatures , as well as at a temperature close to the bulk transition temperature ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the inspection of their time - behavior verified the accuracy of our original estimates and convinced us that the above described practice yields a steady improvement of the time - accumulated average dos of all involved methods . for large lattices ,",
    "the recorded during the wl - walk `` microcanonical estimators '' , for the application of the bh method , appeared to suffer from some `` odd fluctuations '' , possibly due to a weak violation of the detailed balance condition , that separated their various thermal estimates from all other estimates obtained from the other involved methods .",
    "although these `` odd fluctuations '' were within the error - range , we have excluded the corresponding estimates from our thermal averages and we have also used only the ( @xmath70)-histograms recorded via the lee - walk for the further refinement of our susceptibility estimates .",
    "the new averages were used as refined estimates of all properties studied and are presented in our figures using the range @xmath71 .    closing this section ,",
    "let us consider two different definitions for the order - parameter of the model under study .",
    "first , with the help of four sublattices of the saf ordering one may define a two - component order - parameter and finally use its root - mean - square ( _ rms _ )  @xcite @xmath72 an alternative , and numerically more convenient , definition will also be considered from the sum of the absolute values of the four sublattice magnetizations @xmath73 the resulting behavior is very similar and in particular the finite - size extensions of the resulting crmms completely coincide .",
    "therefore , for large lattices only the second order - parameter was used in order to minimize computer memory requirements .",
    "using now the above definition for the order - parameter we may also define the magnetic susceptibility @xmath74 as follows : @xmath75",
    "in general , first - order transitions  @xcite are characterized by discontinuities of an order - parameter , like the internal energy or the magnetization , in an idealized infinite system . however , in a finite - system , a true phase transition can not occur . instead , the jump in the order - parameter is smoothed out into a rounded transition which becomes increasingly sharp as the finite dimensions of the system go to infinity . in this case , the aim of fss theory is to estimate the width and the possible shifts of the rounded transition and to determine the associated scaling functions . in the following subsections we summarize the main difficulties in making a clear distinction between first and second - order transitions and outline useful aspects of the existing theories of first - order transitions .      as pointed out in the introduction , rastelli et al .",
    "@xcite considered the triangular model with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions . using a conventional ( metropolis )",
    "monte carlo approach , these authors concluded that the phase transition from the ordered phase at low temperatures to the high temperature paramagnetic phase is first - order .",
    "the identification of the nature of the transition was based mainly on the clear presence of the energy double - peaks reported .",
    "additional indications were detected from the behavior of the peaks of the binder s fourth - order energy cumulant and also from the scaling of the specific heat , the susceptibility , and the corresponding pseudotransition temperatures . from the fss behavior of the peaks of the binder s fourth - order energy cumulant they estimated limiting minimum values different from the value of 2/3 ( expected for a continuous transition ) which are typically expected for first - order transitions .",
    "the shift behavior of the pseudotransition temperatures was also found in agreement with what is expected at a first - order transition ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , some problems were encountered mainly with the fss of the specific heat peaks .",
    "the estimated divergences were found in marked difference with the expectations of the fss theory of first - order transitions .",
    "for the case studied here ( corresponding to the interaction ratio @xmath21 ) the specific heat exponent @xmath50 ( @xmath77 ) was estimated to have a value @xmath78 instead of the value @xmath5 , which is the common expectation of all existing theories ( see below ) .",
    "a preliminary qualitative comparative study was recently presented by the present authors  @xcite where the behavior of the present triangular saf model was contrasted to the analogous square saf model . in this latter study ,",
    "the marked difference between thermally driven first- and second - order transitions was illustrated by using the rather traditional method of observing differences in the energy s and order - parameter s cumulant - behavior between the two models . for the triangular model the behavior was indicative of a first - order transition , in agreement with ref .",
    "for the square model ( @xmath21 ) the behavior was strongly indicating a second - order critical point  @xcite , in disagreement with the mean - field prediction of lopez et al .",
    "@xcite of a first - order transition for @xmath79 .",
    "consequently , the presence of the energy double - peaks and the scaling shift behavior @xmath80 , in the case of the triangular saf model  @xcite , are indications of a first - order transition , while the absence of energy double - peaks and the fss with critical exponents different from the lattice dimensionality , in the case of square saf model  @xcite , are indications of second - order phase transition .",
    "however , caution should be paid in both cases to ensure that the lattice size is sufficiently large so that irrelevant fields have scaled away and the observed behavior is the true asymptotic one and not a strong finite - size effect that may cease to exist in the thermodynamic limit . at this point",
    "we may recall some already known pitfalls .",
    "the existence of the energy double - peaks for the finite lattice baxter - wu model  @xcite is a counter - example since this model undergoes a second - order phase transition .",
    "such continuous phase transitions with a convex dip in the microcanonical entropy , including the baxter - wu model and the @xmath9 potts model in two dimensions , have been discussed recently by behringer and pleimling  @xcite . in these cases",
    "the pseudosignatures of `` first - order transitions '' are finite - size effects .",
    "similarly the apparent `` first - order transition '' observed in the fixed magnetization version of the ising model is also a finite - size effect  @xcite and it has been shown that this `` transition '' ceases to exist in the thermodynamic limit .    hence , in order to provide strong evidence and to elucidate the distinctive features for models undergoing first - order transitions , accurate and detailed numerical studies are necessary .",
    "such studies have been carried out on the @xmath8 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 potts model and most of the existing theories have been tested and verified using this model  @xcite .",
    "the demonstration of the first - order transition features is more difficult , as should be expected , for weak transitions ( the @xmath8 potts model is a well - known example ) since in these cases the correlation length is relatively large and strong finite - size effects may obscure the true asymptotic behavior  @xcite .",
    "the present extensive numerical study , is an attempt to repeat some of these tests on the triangular saf model , which as will be seen is an interesting weak first - order transition .",
    "our accurate numerical data will permit us to adequately determine the features of the first - order transition of the model , to make interesting comparisons with previous studies , and to draw conclusions related to the applicability of the existing fss theories .",
    "we proceed in interpreting our numerical data using the free energy barrier method proposed by lee and kosterlitz  @xcite . with this method one",
    "may unambiguously identify the order of the transition and also evaluate the latent heat of the transition . by computing the energy distribution at various temperatures ,",
    "we locate a pseudotransition temperature @xmath81 , at which the two equal - height peaks of the energy distribution are observed .",
    "these two peaks are located at the values of the energies per site @xmath82 and @xmath83 , corresponding to the ordered and disordered states respectively , and are separated by a minimum at @xmath84 .",
    "following lee and kosterlitz  @xcite , the free energy barrier is defined with the help of the microcanonical free energy  @xcite , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the energy distribution at the pseudotransition temperature @xmath81 . at a first - order transition",
    "the microcanonical free energy is assumed to have an expansion of the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the bulk free energy which is a minimum and constant for @xmath89 and @xmath90 is a surface free energy which has a maximum at @xmath91 .",
    "the arguments presented by lee and kosterlitz  @xcite suggest the following scaling forms for the finite - size estimates of the locations of the equal - height peaks @xmath92 and @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the bulk energies of the ordered and disordered states respectively . from the above assumptions for the bulk and surface free energies , it follows that the maximum of the surface energy at @xmath91 produces a free energy barrier that scales according to @xmath96 this scaling form has been used as a basic test  @xcite for detecting a temperature - driven first - order transition , while the predicted scaling behavior [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) ] can be used to extrapolate and obtain the latent heat of the transition @xmath97 .",
    "[ fig:1 ] presents the energy distributions for small and large lattice sizes .",
    "although , for the larger lattices the simulation error fluctuations are evident , it is also very clear that with increasing lattice size the barrier between the two peaks is steadily increasing , signaling the emergence of the expected two delta - peak behavior in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , this figure is an effective demonstration of the persistence of the first - order transition .",
    "fig.[fig:2](a ) is the corresponding illustration , including all lattice sizes studied , of the behavior of the free energy barrier , defined above .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that the surface tension , that is the quantity @xmath98 , tends to a non - zero value and the attempt to extrapolate by the dotted line gives a value of the order 0.00539(12 ) .",
    "thus , the expectation ( [ eq:12 ] ) of the arguments of by lee and kosterlitz  @xcite is well verified .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) illustrates the @xmath7-dependence of the location of the energy density peaks ( minima of the free energy ) as well as their difference . again in the scale shown , the expectations described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) are well satisfied .",
    "thus , using linear extrapolations in the range of large @xmath7 , we have estimated the bulk energies @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and the latent heat of the transition @xmath101 .",
