    "population dynamics are a fundamental aspect of many biological processes . in this paper , we introduce and investigate a mathematical model for the population dynamics of an invasive species in a three - species food chain model .",
    "exotic species are defined as any species , capable of propagating themselves into a nonnative environment .",
    "if the propagating species is able to establish a self sustained population in this new environment , it is formally defined as invasive .",
    "the survival and competitiveness of a species depends intrinsically on an individual s fitness and ability to assimilate limited resources .",
    "often invasive species possess the ability to dominate a particular resource .",
    "this allows them to expand their range via out - competing other native species . in the united states damages caused by invasive species to agriculture , forests , fisheries and businesses ,",
    "have been estimated to be @xmath0120 billion a year @xcite . in the words of daniel simberloff : `` _ _ invasive species are a greater threat to native biodiversity than pollution , harvest , and disease combined . _ _ ''",
    "@xcite therefore understanding and subsequently attenuating the spread of invasive species is an important and practical problem in spatial ecology and much work has been devoted to this issue @xcite .",
    "more recently , the spread of natural and invasive species by nonrandom dispersal , say due to competitive pressures , is of great interest @xcite .",
    "however , there has been less focus , on the actual eradication of an invasive species , once it has already invaded .",
    "this is perhaps a harder problem . in the words of mark",
    "lewis : _ `` once the invasive species are well established , there is not a lot you can do to control them''_. @xcite it is needless to say however , that in many ecosystems around the world , invasion has already taken place !",
    "some prominent examples in the us , are the invasion by the burmese python in southern regions of the united states , with climatic factors supporting their spread to a third of the united states @xcite .",
    "the sea lamprey and round goby have invaded the great lakes region in the northern united states and canada @xcite .",
    "these species have caused a severe decline in lake trout and other indigenous fish populations .",
    "lastly the zebra mussel has invaded many us and canadian waterways causing large scale losses to the hydropower industry @xcite .    another factor attributed to the increase of an invasive population ,",
    "is that the environment may turn favorable for the invasive species in question , while becoming unfavorable for its competitors or natural enemies . in such situations ,",
    "the population of the invasive species may rapidly increase .",
    "this is defined as an _ outbreak _ in population dynamics @xcite .",
    "these rapid changes tend to destabilize an ecosystem and pose a threat to the natural environment . as an illustration , in",
    "the european alps certain environmental conditions have enabled the population of the larch budmoth to become large enough that entire forests have become defoliated @xcite . in most ecological landscapes , due to exogenous factors",
    ", one always encounters an invasive species and an invaded species .",
    "if the density of the former , be it invasive , disease causing , an agricultural pest , defoliator or other , undergoes a rapid transition to a high level in population , the results can be catastrophic both for local and nonlocal populations .",
    "biological and chemical controls are an adopted strategy to limit invasive populations @xcite .",
    "chemical controls are most often based on direct methods , via the use of pesticides @xcite .",
    "biological control comprises of essentially releasing natural enemies of the invasive species / pest against it",
    ". these can be in the form of predators , parasitoids , pathogens or combinations thereof @xcite .",
    "there are many problems with these approaches .",
    "for example , a local eradication effort was made by usgs through a mass scale poisoning of fish in order to prevent the asian carp ( an invasive fish species ) from entering the chicago sanitary and ship canal @xcite .",
    "the hope was to protect the fishing interests of the region .",
    "however , among the tens of thousands of dead fish , _ biologists found only one asian carp_. thus chemical control is not an exhaustive strategy .",
    "however , biological controls are also not without its share of problems .",
    "in fact , sometimes the introduced species might attack a variety of species , other than those it was released to control .",
    "this phenomena is referred to as a _ non - target effect _ @xcite , and is common in natural enemies with a broad host range .",
    "for example , the cane toad was introduced in australia in 1935 to control the cane beetle . however , the toad seemingly attacked everything else but its primary target @xcite !",
    "in addition , the toad is highly poisonous and therefore predators shy away from eating it .",
    "this has enabled the toad population to grow virtually unchecked and is today considered one of australia s worst invasive species @xcite . in studies of biological control in the united states",
    "estimate that when parasitoids are released as biological controls that @xmath1 of the introduced species will attack non - targets , in canada these numbers are estimated as high as @xmath2 @xcite . in practise",
    "it is quite difficult to accurately predict these numbers .",
    "the current drawbacks make it clear that alternative controls are necessary .",
    "furthermore , that modeling of alternative controls is important to validate the effectiveness of a management strategy that hopes to avoid non - target effects .",
    "such modeling is essential to access and predict the best controls to employ , so that the harmful population will decrease to low and manageable levels .",
    "this then gives us confidence to devise actual field trials .",
    "we should note that in practice actual eradication is rarely achieved .",
    "thus there are clear questions that motivate this research :    1 .",
    "how does one define a `` high '' level for a population , and further , how well does an introduced control actually work , at various high levels ? 2 .",
    "is it possible to design controls that avoid chemicals / pesticides / natural enemy introduction , and are still successful ?",
    "this paper addresses these questions through the investigation of a mathematical model that :    1 .",
    "blows - up in finite time . given a mathematical model for a nonlinear process , say through a partial differential equation ( pde ) , one says finite time blow up occurs if @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a certain function space with a norm @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the solution to the pde in question , and @xmath7 is the blow up time . therefore `` highest '' level is equated with blow up , and the population passes through every conceivable high level of population as it approaches infinity .",
    "2 .   incorporates certain controls that avoid chemicals / pesticides / natural enemy introduction .",
    "the controls we examine are : 1 .",
    "the primary food source of the invasive species is protected through spatial refuges .",
    "the regions that offer protection are called _ prey refuges _ and may be the result of human intervention or natural byproducts , such as improved camouflage . 2 .",
    "an overcrowding term is introduced to model the movement or dispersion from high concentrations of the invasive species .",
    "densely populated regions have increased intraspecific competition and interference which cause an increase in the dispersal of the invasive species .",
    "this is an improvement to current mathematical models and will be seen to be beneficial if used a control .",
    "3 .   we introduce role reversing mechanisms , where the role of the primary food source of the invasive species , and the prey of this food source , is switched in the open area ( the area without refuge ) .",
    "this models situations where the topography provides competitive advantages to certain species .",
    "it will be seen that this also is beneficial if used a control . in effect",
    ", this uses the current ecosystem and by modifying the landscape a natural predator in the environment has an advantage in key areas .",
    "hence , the invasive species population will adversely be effected .",
    "it can also be thought of as introducing a competitor of the invasive species , to compete with it for its prey .",
    "note , none of the above rely on enemy release to predate on the invasive species , or a parasite or pathogen release to infect the invasive species .",
    "thus potential non - target effects due to such release can be avoided .    in the literature",
    "finite time blow up is also referred to as an explosive instability @xcite .",
    "there is a rich history of blow up problems in pde theory and its interpretations in physical phenomenon .",
    "for example , this feature is seen in models of thermal runaway , fracture and shock formation , and combustion processes .",
    "thus blow up may be interpreted as the failure of certain constitutive materials leading to gradient catastrophe or fracture , it may be interpreted as an uncontrolled feedback loop such as in thermal runaway , leading to explosion . it might also be interpreted as a sudden change in physical quantities such as pressure or temperature such as during a shock or in the ignition process .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "blow up in population dynamics is usually interpreted as excessively high concentrations in small regions of space , such as seen in chemotaxis problems @xcite .",
    "our goal in the current manuscript is to bring yet another interpretation of blow up to population dynamics , that is one where we equate such an excessive concentration or  blow up \" of an invasive population with disaster for the ecosystem .",
    "furthermore , it is to devise controls that avoid non - target effects and yet reduce the invasive population , before the critical blow up time .    in the following , the norms in the spaces @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "are respectively denoted by @xmath11 in addition , the constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 may change between subsequent lines , as the analysis permits , and even in the same line if so required .",
    "the current manuscript is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we formulate the spatially explicit model that we consider . in section",
    "[ 3 ] we describe in detail the modeling of the control mechanisms that we propose , and term  ecological damping \" . here",
    "we make three key conjectures [ c1 ] , [ c2 ] and [ c3 ] , concerning our control mechanisms . section [ 4 ] is devoted to some analytical results given via lemma [ lem : wsol ] , theorem [ thm : wsolimproved ] and [ thm : gattr ] .",
    "section [ 5 ] is where we explain our numerical approximations and test conjectures [ c1 ] , [ c2 ] and [ c3 ] numerically . in section [ 6 ]",
    "we investigate spatio - temporal dynamics in the model .",
    "we investigate the effect of overcrowding on turing patterns , and we also confirm spatio - temporal chaos in the model .",
    "lastly we offer some concluding remarks and discuss future directions in section [ 7 ] .",
    "a three species food chain model is developed , where the top predator , denoted as @xmath6 , is invasive . in our model",
    ", @xmath6 may blow up in finite time .",
    "although populations can not reach infinite values in finite time , they can grow rapidly @xcite .",
    "the blow up event indicates that the invasive population has reached `` an extremely high '' and uncontrollable level .",
    "naturally , that level occurs prior to the blow up time .",
    "therefore , as @xmath15 approaches infinity in finite time , it passes through every conceivable `` high '' level .",
    "the blow up time , @xmath7 , is viewed as the `` disaster '' time .",
    "we investigate mechanisms that attempt to lower and control the targeted population _ before time @xmath7_. this modeling approach has distinct advantages :    1 .",
    "there is no ambiguity as to what is a disastrous high level of population .",
    "2 .   there is a clear demarcation between when or if the disaster occurs .",
    "3 .   the controls that are proposed do not rely on a direct attack on the invasive species , as is the traditional approach , rather we attempt to control the food source of @xmath6 .",
    "this will avoid possible nontarget effects .",
    "the model provides a useful predictive tool that can be tuned and established through data , in various ecological settings .",
    "mathematical models are advantageous in many situations due to their cost - effectiveness and versatility .",
    "of course obtaining an analytical solution for a nonlinear model is virtually impossible , outside of special cases .",
    "however , a numerical approximation can be developed to accurately investigate the role and effect our controls have on the blow up behavior .",
    "suppose an invasive species @xmath6 has invaded a certain habitat and it has become the top predator in a three species food chain .",
    "hence , @xmath6 predates on a middle predator @xmath16 , which in turn predates on a prey @xmath17 .",
    "a temporal model is given for the species interaction , namely @xmath18 the spatial dependence is included via diffusion , @xmath19 defined on @xmath20 .",
    "here @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the one or two dimensional laplacian operator .",
    "we define @xmath24 to be the spatial coordinate vector in one or two dimensions .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are positive diffusion coefficients .",
    "neumann boundary conditions are specified on the boundary .",
    "the initial populations are given as @xmath28 are assumed to be nonnegative and uniformly bounded on @xmath29 .",
    "there are various parameters in the model : @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 are all positive constants .",
    "their definitions are as follows : @xmath35 is the growth rate of prey @xmath17 ; @xmath36 measures the rate at which @xmath16 dies out when there is no @xmath17 to prey on and no @xmath6 ; @xmath37 is the maximum value that the per - capita rate can attain ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 measure the level of protection provided by the environment to the prey ; @xmath40 is a measure of the competition among prey , @xmath17 ; @xmath41 is the value of @xmath16 at which its per capita removal rate becomes @xmath42 ; @xmath34 represents the loss in @xmath6 due to the lack of its favorite food , @xmath16 ; @xmath43 describes the growth rate of @xmath6 via sexual reproduction .",
    "these models offer rich dynamics and were originally proposed in @xcite in order to explain why chaos has rarely been observed in natural populations of three interacting species .",
    "the model stems from the leslie - gower formulation and considers interactions between a generalist top predator , specialist middle predator and prey .",
    "the study of these models have generated much research @xcite .",
    "an interesting fact is if @xmath44 the spatially independent and spatially dependent models are easily seen to blow up in finite time @xcite .",
    "the spatially dependent model offers further rich dynamics , in particular the possibility of turing instabilities and non turing patterns @xcite . nevertheless , to avoid blow up",
    "it appears that one must restrict @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "this was established for the spatially independent model in @xcite and is offered here for convenience :    [ thm : aziz ] consider the model - . under the assumption that @xmath47 all non - negative solutions ( i.e. solutions initiating in @xmath48 ) of - are uniformly bounded forward in time and they eventually enter an attracting set @xmath49 .",
    "we have recently shown the above result to be _ false _ in the ode and pde cases .",
    "that is , - may blow up in finite time , even under provided the initial data is large enough @xcite .",
    "it is clear that even if is maintained @xmath6 can blow up .",
    "this becomes more evident if we consider the coefficient @xmath50 on @xmath51 and the fact that if the fecundity of @xmath6 is large compared to @xmath52 then blow up will occur .",
    "this may happen in situations where :    1 .",
    "there is an abundance of @xmath16 , 2 .",
    "@xmath6 possesses certain abilities to out compete other species , and harvest enough @xmath16 , 3 .",
    "the environment has turned favorable for @xmath6 and unfavorable for its natural enemies or competitors .",
    "thus it can harvest @xmath16 unchecked .",
    "if no intervention is made we can envision @xmath6 growing to disastrous levels with adequate initial resources .",
    "the blow up time @xmath53 is viewed as the point of disaster in an ecosystem .",
    "thus one is interested in controlling @xmath6 via the use of biological controls , before the critical time @xmath53 .",
    "these observations motivate an interesting question .",
    "assume that both - and its spatially explicit form - blow up in finite time for @xmath54 for a given initial condition .",
    "can we modify - , via introducing certain controls , so that now _ there is no blow up _",
    ", for the same initial condition ?",
    "it is clear that controlling the population of an invasive specie is advantageous , and most often necessary .",
    "however the avenues for which this is possible , whilst avoiding non - target effects , is not clear . here",
    ", we propose new controls that may delay or even remove blow - up in the invasive population .",
    "we refer to these controls as  ecological damping \" , akin to damping forces such as friction in physical systems , that add stability to a system .",
    "the crux of our idea is to use prey refuges , in conjunction with role reversal and overcrowding effects .",
    "there is a vast literature on prey refuge , spatial refuges as well as role reversal in the literature .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge these have not been proposed as control mechanisms for invasive species .       in the one dimensional case .",
    "this function decreases monotonically throughout its domain .",
    "the range is @xmath55 . if @xmath56 then the prey @xmath16 is protected while if @xmath57 then @xmath16 is unprotected .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    we consider modeling a prey refuge .",
    "consider the continuous function @xmath58 .",
    "the region where @xmath59 or sufficiently close to one is defined as a _ prey refuge domain _ or _",
    "patch_. we call the region where @xmath60 or sufficiently close to zero an open area , this is the region where @xmath6 can predate on @xmath16 . in figure",
    "[ fig : refugeplot ] we see a sharp gradient between the prey refuge domain and the open area .",
    "the inclusion of a prey refuge influences the equations for @xmath6 and @xmath16 , namely , @xmath61 posed on a bounded domain in one or two dimensions .",
    "neumann boundary conditions are specified . the equation for @xmath17",
    "may be found in .",
    "the introduction of the prey refuge creates regions where it is impossible for @xmath6 to predate on @xmath16 .",
    "notice , that if the entire spatial domain is considered a prey refuge , that is , @xmath59 @xmath62 , then the coefficient of @xmath51 will depend on the sign of @xmath54 .",
    "if this is negative , then the invasive species dies off .",
    "likewise , in the absence of a prey refuge , that is , @xmath60 @xmath62 the equations for @xmath6 and @xmath16 collapse to our previous ones , that is , and , respectively .",
    "in such a case , it is know that blow up may still occur for sufficiently large enough data even if @xmath54 .",
    "this is because the coefficient of @xmath51 may still be positive , as one always has @xmath63 . the introduction of the refuge _ forces _ the coefficient of @xmath51 to change sign between the refuge and the open area . in the literature",
    "such problems are referred to as indefinite parabolic problems .",
    "the word _ indefinite",
    "_ refers to the sign of the coefficient being indefinite . although there is a vast literature on such problems for single species models",
    "@xcite , there is far less work for systems .",
    "there is also a large amount of literature for such switching mechanisms incorporated to understand competitive systems @xcite , particularly in the vein of human economic progress .",
    "this indefinite parabolic problem motivates a collection of questions : if blow up occurs for particular parameters in the case @xmath60 , will a prey refuge prevent blow up ?",
    "how does this depend on the geometry of the refuge ?",
    "what is the critical size or shape of a refuge that prevents blow up from occurring ? does this depend on the size of the initial condition ?",
    "in the situation that blow up still persists , how is the blow up time affected ?",

    "we may assume @xmath81 .",
    "we then multiply by @xmath82 and integrate by parts in @xmath83 to obtain @xmath84 thus @xmath85 we now define the functional @xmath86 since @xmath87 we obtain @xmath88 now we multiply by @xmath6 and integrate integrate by parts in @xmath83 to obtain @xmath89 this yields @xmath90 so if @xmath91 then @xmath92 and so @xmath93 this essentially yields @xmath94 setting @xmath95 .",

    "a species should have greater dispersal in order to better assimilate available resources and avoid crowding effects such as increased intraspecific competition .",
    "these effects can be modeled via an overcrowding term , that has not been included in mathematical models of biological control .",
    "consider the improved mathematical model that includes an overcrowding effect of the invasive species @xmath6 , namely , @xmath108 with initial and boundary conditions as before .",
    "again , the equation for @xmath17 remains unchanged .",
    "the addition of @xmath109 represents a severe penalty on local overcrowding .",
    "this is interpreted as movement from high towards low concentrations of @xmath6 , directly proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "hence , @xmath6 attempts to avoid overcrowding and disperses toward lower concentrations .",
    "such models have been under intense investigation recently and are referred to as cross - diffusion and self - diffusion systems @xcite .",
    "the mathematical analysis of such models is notoriously difficult @xcite .",
    "we limit ourselves to the one - dimensional case in the forthcoming analysis and its numerical approximations .",
    "therefore the one dimensional laplacian is considered in .",
    "the presence of blow up is not affected if we maintain neumann boundary conditions at the boundaries .",
    "this can be seen in a straightforward manner .",

    "therefore , without loss of generality , there exists a @xmath110 such that @xmath111 .",

    "now , consider the integration over @xmath29 of . since the overcrowding term integrates to zero then blow up still persists .",
    "however , a combination of a prey refuge with the overcrowding effect may prevent blow up .",
    "further , we expect it takes a smaller refuge to accomplish the removal of blow up .",
    "this is precisely the following conjecture :    [ c2 ] consider the three species food chain model - , a set of parameters , such that @xmath64 , and an initial condition @xmath65 such that @xmath6 which is the solution to , blows up in finite time , that is @xmath115 there exists a patch @xmath116 , and an overcrowding coefficient @xmath117 , s.t for any single patch of measure greater than or equal to @xmath118 , the modified model - , with the same parameter set and initial condition , has globally existing solutions . in particular the solution @xmath6 to , does not blow up in finite time .",
    "furthermore , @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the patch found in conjecture .",
    "this is not difficult to see , as multiplying through by @xmath6 and integrating by parts yields @xmath121 so if @xmath91 then @xmath92 and so @xmath122    thus even if one has negative energy , @xmath123 so that blows - up , due to the presence of the positive @xmath124 term in , will not blow up for small data , thus yielding a global solution .",
    "thus there are initial data for which blow ups but does not , and so a smaller refuge would work in this case .",
    "the method follows by mimicing the steps in - , with the additional @xmath124 term .",
    "the prey refuge and overcrowding are included in the one - dimensional mathematical model .",
    "we also include a role - reversal of @xmath17 within the protection zone of the refuge .",

    "is affected by the presence of a refuge .",
    "for instance , for a fixed parameter set we look at the effect on the blow up time with a refuge , refuge with role reversal , and role reversal and overcrowding as compared to the classical model .",

    "interestingly , in the modified model with role reversal , it is found that blow up does not occur when @xmath57 or @xmath361 in the spatial domain .",
    "we also see that the blow up times are influenced by the size of the refuge .",
    "in fact , there is critical refuge size for which given any refuge size greater then the solutions will not blow up .",
    "this is evidenced in figure [ numblowupvsrefuge ] by the steep gradient of the curves around @xmath362 .",
    "therefore , the population of the invasive species can be controlled . in situations where there is only a spatial refuge the blow up time curve is always increasing .",
    "this is consistent with our two dimensional results .",
    "it is clear that there exists a critical refuge size for which refuges larger than this will prevent blow up . in the one - dimensional model , without role reversal or overcrowding effects , we investigate the effect of the critical refuge size versus the size of the initial condition of @xmath16 while maintaining the other initial conditions and parameters values .",
    "we use the same parameters as given in figure [ numblowupvsrefuge ] and vary the uniform initial condition on @xmath16 .",
    "interestingly , figure [ num : refugevsic ] shows a logarithmic dependency of the critical refuge size to prevent blow - up of @xmath6 , on the initial condition size of @xmath16 .     for which blow up in the invasive specie population @xmath6 will occur .",
    "identical parameters and resolution are used as in figure [ numblowupvsrefuge ] .",
    "the domain was translated and scaled to @xmath358 . ]",
    "the size of the spatial refuge has an influence on the blow up time .",
    "however , the location and number of spatial refuges also influences the blow up time .",
    "in fact , blow up is sometimes eliminated depending on the initial condition , refuges , and their subsequent locations .",
    "for instance , if we consider a uniform initial condition in @xmath6 and compare the blow up time in a situation of a single refuge of width located near the boundary versus the case of evenly splitting this refuge then we find the blow up time is increased .",
    "this delay is exasperated if the two refuges are farther apart .",
    "of course , if we consider a different initial condition then blow may not just be delayed , rather removed !",
    "for instance if we consider a concentrated initial population of @xmath6 for which the highest concentration of @xmath6 contains the spatial refuge then blow up can be eliminated ! hence , the concentration of @xmath6 inside the refuge may protect the species enough so that the population of @xmath6 decays sufficiently to avoid blow up in its population .     that is , @xmath363 , is shown versus time . with a circular refuge , we see that blow up is avoided .",
    "this provides experimental evidence that the location and size of the refuge is important to avoid blow up in the invasive population .",
    "the dashed line represents the population in the case where there is no spatial refuge .",
    "the simulations were done on a @xmath364 uniform grid with a temporal step of @xmath365 . ]    to illustrate this consider the two - dimensional model , , and with an initial condition of @xmath366 with parameters @xmath367 , @xmath368 , @xmath369 , @xmath370 , @xmath371 , @xmath372 , @xmath373 , @xmath374 , @xmath375 , @xmath376 , @xmath377 , @xmath378 , @xmath379 . clearly , the coefficient @xmath380 . if @xmath381 is zero throughout the entire spatial domain there exists blow up in the @xmath6 population . however , if we have a circular refuge such that , @xmath382 for @xmath383 then blow up is avoided .",
    "figure [ rpopulationavoided ] shows the total population versus time .",
    "we can see the population starts to increase rapidly , but the increase is attenuated as a result of the spatial refuge .",
    "hence , the population growth is not sustained and begins to decrease .",
    "hence , the size * and * location of the refuge and the initial condition play a delicate balance in preventing blow up .    in two dimensions",
    "if we choose a particular shape of the spatial refuge it was conjectured that there exists a critical size for which blow up is avoided . here ,",
    "we look at two situations : a square and circular refuges with increasing size centered in the middle of the spatial domain . we let @xmath59 inside the refuge while @xmath384 outside .",
    "this clearly delineates the protection zones . for a fixed parameter regime and initial conditions of @xmath385",
    "we determine the critical refuge size .",
    "each calculation is carried out with a @xmath364 grid .",
    "the temporal step was fixed at @xmath386 .",
    "the parameters used : @xmath367 , @xmath387 , @xmath388 , @xmath371 , @xmath389 , @xmath373 , @xmath374 , @xmath375 , @xmath376 , @xmath377 , @xmath378 , @xmath379 .",
    "it is found that for a square the critical refuge area is @xmath390 roughly @xmath391 of the spatial domain .",
    "the critical refuge area for the circular refuge is approximately @xmath392 , roughly @xmath393 of the spatial domain .",
    "in this section we shall investigate the effects of overcrowding in the absence of refuges and role reversal , in the classical model .",

    "we obtain the characteristic equation @xmath415 is a @xmath416 identity matrix .",

    "this state that for @xmath404 to be stable we need @xmath421 contradicting either of these statements ensures instability for @xmath404 . finally , for diffusion to cause a turing instability it is sufficient to require that around the equilibrium point we have @xmath422 we refer the reader to a well detailed analysis of this in @xcite .",
    "hence , for a turing instability to occur , we require that is satisfied when @xmath423 ( without diffusion ) and at least one of the equations in changes sign when @xmath424 ( with diffusion ) . by this",

    "this suggests that spatial patterns should be observed .",
    "our parameter search has not yielded a parameter set for which holds while @xmath426 when @xmath427 , at least one of these inequalities changes sign .",
    "thus we can not conclusively say that @xmath428 will induce or inhibit turing pattern .",

    "it is noted that the inclusion of overcrowding with a nonlinear death rate , such as in , can lead to turing instability in the classical predator - prey model with holling type ii response .",
    "the goal of this section is to investigate spatio - temporal chaos in the classical model - .",
    "spatio - temporal chaos is usually defined as deterministic dynamics in spatially extended systems that are characterized by an apparent randomness in space and time @xcite .",
    "there is a large literature on spatio - temporal chaos in pde , in particular there has been a recent interest on spatially extended systems in ecology exhibiting spatio - temporal chaos @xcite .",
    "however , most of these works are on two species models , and there is not much literature in the three - species case . in @xcite",
    "we showed diffusion induced temporal chaos in - , as well as spatial chaos when the domain is enlarged . in @xcite ,",
    "various patterns non - turing were uncovered in - , in the case of equal diffusion , but spatio - temporal chaos was not confirmed .",
    "note , that the appearance of a jagged structure in the species density , as seen in @xcite , which seems to change in time in an irregular way , does not necessarily mean that the dynamics is chaotic .",
    "one rigoros definition of chaos means sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "thus two initial distribution , close together , should yield an exponentially growing difference in the species distribution at later time . in order to confirm this in -",
    ", we perform a number of tests as in @xcite . we run - form a number of different initial conditions , that are the same modulo a small perturbation .",
    "the parameter set is chosen as in @xcite .",
    "we then look at the difference of the two densities , at each time step in both the @xmath226 and @xmath439 norms .",
    "thus we solve - with the following parameter set : @xmath440 , @xmath441 @xmath442 @xmath443 thus the steady state solution for the ode system is @xmath444 .",
    "the simulations use two different ( but close together in @xmath445 norms ) initial conditions .",
    "the first simulation ( which we call @xmath446 ) is a perturbation of @xmath447 by @xmath448 . the second simulation ( which we call @xmath449 ) is a perturbation of @xmath447 by @xmath450 .",
    "the densities of the species are calculated up to the time @xmath451 at each time step in the simulation we compute @xmath452 where @xmath453 are used .",
    "then , @xmath454 is plotted on a log scale . in doing son",
    ", we observe the exponential growth of the error .",
    "this grows at an approximate rate of @xmath455 .",
    "since this is positive then this is an indicator of spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "these numerical tests provide experimental evidence to the presence of spatio - temporal chaos in the classical model - .",

    "in this work we have proposed and investigated a new model for the control of an invasive population .",
    "an invasive species population is said to reach catastrophic population levels when its population reaches a particular threshold .",
    "the mathematical model uses the mathematical construct of finite time blow up which enables the model to examine the effect of controls for any particular threshold , especially since this level depends on the application . in effect",
    ", this construct demonstrates that if the invasive population has large enough numbers initially , it can grow to explosive levels in finite time : thus wreaking havoc on the ecosystem .",
    "hence , we are interested in the influence certain controls will have on the invasive population and if its population may be reduced below disastrous levels .",
    "this formulation yields a clear mathematical problem : assume that - blows - up in finite time for @xmath54 for a given initial condition .",
    "are there controls and features of the model that we can include to modify - so that now _ there is no blow up _ in the invasive population given the same initial condition ?",
    "this paper addresses this question , suggesting clear controls and improvements to the mathematical model .",
    "we then investigate these improvements numerically and theoretically .    in traditional practice ,",
    "biological control works on the enemy release hypothesis . that is releasing an enemy of the invasive species into the ecosystem will lead to a decrease in the invasive population .",
    "however , non - target effects are prevalent , hence this approach is problematic and may create even more devastating impacts on the ecosystem @xcite . here",
    ", we propose controls that do not use the release of biological agents .",
    "in particular , we introduce spatial refuges or safe zones for the primary food source of the invasive species .",
    "mathematically , this transforms - into an indefinite problem @xcite , that is , where the sign of the coefficient of @xmath51 switches between inside and outside of the refuge .",
    "we demonstrated numerically and in analytically , with some assumptions , that this control can prevent blow up and drive the invasive population down .",
    "our numerical experiments suggests that there is a delicate balance between the size and location of the refuge and the initial condition .",
    "in particular , we revealed a logarithmic dependence on the size of the initial condition for @xmath16 versus the critical refuge size to prevent blow - up of @xmath6 , see figure [ num : refugevsic ] .",
    "clearly , the balance is even more pronounced for multiple refuges and in higher dimensions .",
    "we also improved the mathematical model by incorporating overcrowding effects , which also may be used a control .",
    "we also examined the situation where a species may switch its primary food source based in regions of the domain , that is , a prey may switch to a predator , hence their roles are reversed .",
    "this models scenarios where influences on the landscape provide a competitive advantages to certain species . both , role - reversal and overcrowding act as damping mechanisms and also may prevent blow - up in the invasive population . in particular , smaller refuge sizes in conjunction with role - reversal and overcrowding are required to prevent blow up . of course , how does one enforce overcrowding in an ecosystem such that we obtain this desired effect ?",
    "can one devise mechanisms to facilitate this dispersal of population ?",
    "we suggest one approach .",
    "suppose we create a lure , such as a pheromone trap , that is placed in the refuge .",
    "this would lure the invasive species into the patch , where its growth would be controlled .",
    "of course , the species would eventually exit the refuge in search for a higher concentration of food . hence , in the future we plan to include spatially dependent diffusion constants to model this situation .    in our mathematical models we confirmed spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "we also see that overcrowding can effect the sorts of turing patterns that might form .",
    "since , environmental effects are inherently stochastic , part of our future investigations introduces stochasticity into the model .",
    "it is not known what effect this will have on the spatio - temporal chaos or turing patterns that may emerge .",
    "it is clear that our new mathematical modeling constructs and results are useful analytical and numerical tool for scientists interested in control of invasive species .",
    "moreover , the results motivate and encourage numerous avenues of future exploration , many of which are currently under study and will be presented in future papers .",
    "we would like to acknowledge very helpful conversations with professor pavol quittner , professor philippe souplet and professor joseph shomberg , as pertains to the analysis of indefinite parabolic problems , as well as finite time blow - up in the superlinear parabolic problem , under various boundary conditions , and initial data restrictions .",
