    "based on the flatness of rotation curves in spiral galaxies and the density profiles inferred from x - ray temperatures and stellar velocity dispersion profiles in ellipticals , it is widely believed that galaxies are embedded in non - dissipative massive dark halos .",
    "more than 90% of the total mass of a galaxy would be in the form of dark matter .",
    "less appreciated is the fact that we still have a rather muddled picture of the mass distribution of luminous and dark matter in the luminous part of a galaxy .",
    "this is unfortunate since the final distribution of baryons in a galaxy is a tell - tale sign of its formation and evolution .",
    "numerical and analytical models of disk formation in a dissipationless dark matter halo predict , for realistic total fractions of baryonic to dark matter , that spiral disks should live in dark halos that dominate the mass fraction at nearly all radii ( mo , mao , & white 1998 ) , beyond about a disk scale length .",
    "this ratio may quite possibly be different for barred and unbarred galaxies of a given total mass or luminosity ( courteau & rix 1999 ; hereafter cr99 ) .",
    "recent debates about the cold dark matter paradigm ( weinberg & katz 2002 ; sellwood 2003 ; courteau et  al .",
    "2003a ) and galaxy structural properties inferred from new infrared surveys ( eskridge et  al 2002 ; macarthur et  al .",
    "2003 ) have brought barred galaxies to the fore .",
    "bar perturbations in galaxies , far from just being dynamical curiosities , actually play a fundamental role in shaping galaxies into the structures we see today ( see buta , crocker , & elmegreen 1996 for reviews ) .",
    "for instance , the early dynamical evolution of a massive rapidly rotating gaseous bar could provide enough energy and angular momentum to significantly modify the inner cdm halo ( silk 2002 ) .",
    "dynamical and structural studies of barred galaxies are however few , due in part to the complexity in interpreting their velocity fields ( weiner et  al .",
    "2001 ) and their surface brightness profiles ( macarthur et  al .",
    "many large - scale flow studies of spiral galaxies have also excluded disturbed or barred galaxies to minimize scatter , as previously believed , in the distance - measuring technique .",
    "the latter studies have enabled extensive scaling relation studies of unbarred galaxies , but little attention has been paid to their barred cousins .",
    "this is again deplorable as a comparative study of the scaling relations for barred and unbarred galaxies would potentially unravel clues about the structure and origin of bars and the role of dynamical processes in establishing the hubble sequence of disk galaxies .",
    "the body of numerical simulations of barred galaxies is comparatively richer and has recently reached new heights with the availability of superior n - body realizations with more than @xmath2 particles ( post 2010 readers may enjoy a moment of laughter ) . until just recently , it was believed that bar instabilities in a disk might be suppressed by a massive halo .",
    "thus only low concentration halos , or equivalently systems of very high surface brightness ( hsb ) or low angular momentum per unit luminosity , would be prone to generating a non - axisymmetric ( bar / oval ) structure in their center ( ostriker & peebles 1973 ; accounts of the misconceptions surrounding this argument are presented in bosma 1996 and sellwood & evans 2001 ) .",
    "the suggestion that barred galaxies would have an especially high ratio of baryons - to - dark matter within the optical disk ( `` maximal disk '' ) might imply that these systems define their own sequence in the luminosity - line width diagram , if one assumes that unbarred galaxies are , on average , sub - maximal ( cr99 ) .",
    "thus , for a given absolute magnitude , a galaxy with higher baryon fraction , or disk mass - to - light ( @xmath3 ) ratio , would have a shorter disk scale length and rotate faster .",
    "verification of this important , though tentative , suggestion should be easily obtained from a large sample of uniformly selected barred galaxies that are part of a well - calibrated , self - consistent luminosity - line width survey .",
    "the current study was largely motivated by this question .    in discussing the mass distribution in spiral galaxies , we shall use the definition that a disk is `` maximal '' if it contributes more than 75% of the total rotational support of the galaxy at @xmath4 , the radius of maximum disk circular speed ( sackett 1997 ) .",
    "thus , for a maximal disk , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total amplitude of the rotation curve at @xmath7 and @xmath8 . note that for @xmath9 the disk and halo contribute equally to the potential at @xmath7 .",
    "large bulges for late - type galaxies make little difference for the computation of this quantity at @xmath7 ( cr99 ) .",
    "the pattern speeds of bars have been considered as a potential indicator of the relative fraction of dark matter in galaxy disks .",
    "n - body simulations of bar formation in stellar disks suggest that dynamical friction from a dense dark matter halo dramatically slows the rotation rate of bars in a few orbital periods ( debattista & sellwood 1998 , 2000 ; hereafter ds00 ) .",
    "because bars are observed to rotate quickly , ds00 proposed that dark matter halos in hsb galaxies must have a low central density ; thus , their disks ought to be maximal .",
    "these simulations were revisited by valenzuela & klypin ( 2003 ; hereafter vk03 ) with similar n - body simulations ( no gas ) but with an order of magnitude improvement in the force resolution .",
    "vk03 found that dynamical friction from transfer of angular momentum of the bar to the halo does play a role but , contrary to ds00 , that effect appears to be small .",
    "in addition , vk03 find that bars can form even in the presence of strong halos , and that stellar disks make a negligible contribution to the inner rotation curve ( at @xmath7 ) .",
    "the bars modeled in ds00 also span nearly the entire disk whereas the observed bar - to - disk scale length ratio seldom exceeds 1.5 , as also pointed out by vk03 .",
    "these authors find that mass and force resolution are critical for modeling the dynamics of bars , and the contentious results from ds00 would stem primarily from numerical resolution effects .",
    "however , the higher force resolution of vk03 induces numerical viscosity which may bring their results into question ( j. sellwood 2003 ; priv .",
    "free from the vagaries of numerical simulations , athanassoula ( 2003 ) uses analytical calculations to warn against the use of bar slowdown rate to set limits on the baryonic to dark matter fraction within the optical radius , in agreement with sellwood ( 2003 ) .",
    "this point is however moot since one can not observe bar slowdown from a single snapshot .",
    "athanassoula ( 2003 ) further suggests that the ratio of corotation to bar length may not be an adequate estimator of halo fraction , but the model ratios ( see her figs . 12 & 14 ) upon which these conclusions are drawn are inconsistent with observations .",
    "a complete picture of bar dynamics awaits a self - consistent treatment of both the stars _ and _ gas embedded in a cosmologically motivated halo .",
    "these simulations should include dynamical friction and ultimately reproduce the fraction of strong bars detected in the infrared and predict the rate of bar slowdown and dissolution as a function of bulge / total brightnesses , time , and environment .",
    "the model - independent quest of the relative matter distribution in barred and unbarred galaxies is by no means straightforward either , but is most significant as it provides a necessary constraint for the shape and amplitude of the dark matter density profile in the luminous part of a galaxy . whether disks are maximal or not at @xmath7 , the inner 1 - 2  kpc may be dominated by baryons in most galactic systems , including early and late - type hsb barred and unbarred spirals ( broeils & courteau 1997 ; corsini et  al .",
    "1999 ) , low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( swaters 1999 ; swaters , madore , & trewhella 2000 ; fuchs 2002 ) and ellipticals ( brighenti & mathews 1997 ; see also ciotti 2000 ) .",
    "maximally massive disks in lsb galaxies may however require unrealistically high disk @xmath3 ratios ( swaters et  al .",
    "2000 ; fuchs 2002 ) , based on stellar population synthesis models .",
    "also troublesome is our lack of knowledge about the distribution of matter in our own milky way . whether it has a maximal disk ( gerhard 2002 ) or not ( dehnen & binney 1998 ; klypin , zhao , & somerville 2002 ) is still a matter of debate .",
    "crucial elements for local mass density estimates include the precise contribution of the massive central bar ( zhao , rich , & spergel 1996 ) or elongated bulge ( kuijken 1995 ) , an accurate measure of the disk scale length , and constraints from microlensing towards the bulge .",
    "the determination of the relative fraction of visible and dark matter in external barred and unbarred galaxies relies on our ability to determine stellar @xmath3 ratios accurately .",
    "the modeling of disk dynamical mass in barred galaxies relies heavily on the interpretation of the non - axisymmetric motions of ionized gas around the bar within the context of a hydrodynamical model .",
    "this model does have a local potential , and hence the bar and disk @xmath3 are parameters of the model .",
    "it is certainly a more complicated approach than using collisionless particles as dynamical tracers , as with stellar velocity dispersions , but the latter has its own complications as well ( swaters et  al .",
    "significant improvements in mass modeling techniques for individual galaxies are expected with the development of stellar population synthesis models ( bell & de jong 2001 ) and dynamical constraints ( weiner , sellwood , & williams 2001 ) to yield realistic @xmath3 ratios , and further constraints from cosmological simulations of dark halos to curtail disk - halo degeneracies ( dutton , courteau , & de jong 2003 ) .",
    "various lines of circumstantial evidence for external systems favor dark matter halos that dominate the mass budget within @xmath7 .",
    "arguments based on the stellar kinematics of galactic disks ( bottema 1997 ) , gas kinematics ( kranz , slyz , & rix 2003 ) , the stability of disks ( fuchs 2001 ) and the lack of correlated scatter in the tully - fisher relation ( hereafter tfr ; tully & fisher 1977 ) of unbarred lsb and hsb galaxies ( cr99 ) suggest that , _ on average _ , disks with @xmath10 kms^-1km@xmath11s@xmath12  are sub - maximal .",
    "the two very different analyses by bottema and cr99 both yield @xmath13 , or @xmath14 for hsb galaxies at @xmath7 . the geometry of gravitational lens systems , coupled with rotation curve measurements , can also be used to decompose the mass distribution of a lensing galaxy .",
    "this promising technique , pioneered by maller et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , has been applied to the galaxy - lens system 2237 + 0305 by trott & webster ( 2002 ) who find @xmath15 , in excellent agreement with the studies above and predictions from analytical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. dalcanton et  al .",
    "1997 ; mo , mao , & white 1998 ) .",
    "while a consistent picture of galaxy structure is emerging in which a dark halo dominates with @xmath16 well into the optical disk , a number of pro - maximal disk arguments are still found in the literature , citing evidence from the shapes and extent of rotation curves and mass modeling ( see , e.g. , bosma 2002 ) .",
    "the match between _ pure disk _",
    "mass models and rotation curves ( broeils & courteau 1997 ; seljak 2002 ; jimenez et  al .",
    "2003 ) is usually satisfactory for spiral galaxies of different surface brightnesses and morphologies and has often been invoked as evidence for a maximal concentration of baryons relative to the dark matter inside the optical disk ( buchhorn 1992 ; palunas & williams 2000 ) .",
    "however , mass modeling with rotation curves alone is not a uniquely determined problem .",
    "the equivalence of , or degeneracy between , the two descriptions  pure disk versus sub - maximal disk + dark halo  was demonstrated in broeils & courteau ( 1997 ) and cr99 for a sample of 300 disk galaxies ; residuals for the maximal or sub - maximal fits are indistinguishable . without an accurate estimate of @xmath17 , or external constraints on @xmath18 at @xmath7",
    ", mass modeling can not dissentangle maximal and sub - maximal disk models .",
    "our study of the dynamical structure of barred and unbarred galaxies will offer new insights in the debate of the maximal disk hypothesis in barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "however , we plan to revisit this controversial issue in a future presentation ( courteau et  al .",
    "2003a ) . here",
    "we pursue our comparison of barred and unbarred galaxies in the context of global scaling relations .",
    "the study of scaling relations of barred galaxies , and tracing their location in the tfr , requires that we utilize `` fundamental plane '' surveys of an ensemble of galaxies .",
    "the `` shellflow '' and `` scii '' all - sky tully - fisher surveys of courteau et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) and dale et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) are useful in that respect .",
    "these surveys were designed to map the convergence of the velocity field on @xmath19 mpc scales while minimizing calibration errors between different telescopes in different hemispheres ; state - of - the - art tf calibrations are thus available in both cases .",
    "both surveys include line width and luminosity measurements for a small fraction of barred galaxies that can be used to study structural trends , provided the presence of bar does not bias these measurements .",
    "more details about the surveys will be given in .    in order to calibrate existing long - slit spectra of barred galaxies and",
    "initiate a comprehensive study of barred galaxy velocity fields , we have collected new deep v and i - band images and integral field  velocity fields of 14 strongly barred galaxies at the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "we present the new data and velocity field analysis in and discuss possible limitations of the data , such as due to inclination uncertainties and non - circular motions .",
    "we then examine the location of barred and unbarred galaxies in the tf samples discussed above in .",
    "we find that barredness does not play a role in the luminosity - line width and luminosity - size planes of spiral galaxies . in",
    ", we discuss future programs that may benefit the study of scaling relations in barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "in march 2002 , we obtained 2-d velocity maps and deep v and i - band photometry at the wiyn 3.5-m ( 3 nights ) and wiyn 0.9-m ( 2 nights ) , respectively for 14 strongly barred bright galaxies ( sbb - sbc ; @xmath20 ; see table 1 ) and one unbarred spiral galaxy ( ngc 3029 ) .",
    "the galaxies were selected according to the same criteria as the tf shellflow survey of spiral galaxies , save the emphasis on the bar - like morphology .",
    "ultimately , we aim to calibrate our new data on the same system as shellflow , a survey deficient in barred galaxies , to enable direct comparisons between barred and unbarred systems .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) , which is lacking in shellflow and scii , is required to fully characterize the velocity amplitudes of the bulge , bar , and underlying disk , especially if non - circular velocities are conspicuous .",
    "we have obtained 2-d velocity maps with the sparsepak integral field unit ( bershady et  al .",
    "the sparsepak ifu is a fiber - optic array of 82 fibers mounted at the nasmyth f/6.3 focus imaging port on the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "sparsepak has 75 fibers arranged in a sparsely filled grid sub - tending an area of 72@xmath21 73 .",
    "each fiber has an active core diameter of 469 ( 500 @xmath22 m ) ; cladding and buffer increase the total fiber diameter to 56 .",
    "the filling factor for the grid is @xmath23% on average , but rises to @xmath24% in the inner 16  where the fibers are more densely packed .",
    "in addition to the 75 fibers arranged in a square , another 7 fibers are spaced around the square roughly @xmath25@xmath26 from the center and are used to measure the `` sky '' flux .",
    "an example of the sparsepak footprint is shown in .",
    "sparsepak feeds the wiyn bench spectrograph , a fiber  fed spectrograph designed to provide low to medium resolution spectra .",
    "we used the bench spectrograph camera ( bsc ) and 316 lines mm@xmath12 echelle grating in order 8 to cover 6500a @xmath27 6900a , with a dispersion of 0.2a  pix@xmath12 ( 8.8 kms^-1km@xmath11s@xmath12  pix@xmath12 ) and an instrumental fwhm of 0.6a  ( 26.5  kms^-1km@xmath11s@xmath12 ) .",
    "the bsc images the spectrograph onto a t2kc thinned site @xmath28 ccd with 24 @xmath22m - pixels .",

    "2003b ) .    given sparsepak s",
    "@xmath30  center - to - center fiber spacing and total area , we used 3 pointings along the galaxy s position angle to maximize spatial coverage and filling factor .",
    "typical pointing offsets were @xmath31 .",
    "the observed galaxies have moderate sizes ( @xmath32 ) and their velocity field can thus be mapped from center - to - edge .",
    "total sparsepak integrations consisted of 3 pointings @xmath21 2 900s exposures per pointing , for a total of 1.75 hours per galaxy .",
    "multiple exposures at each position were used to identify and remove cosmic rays .",
    "spectra obtained from sparsepak closely resemble wiyn densepak or hydra spectra ( multi - fiber spectral data ) .",

    "we rejected any line with a @xmath33 .",
    "more than 70% of measured h@xmath0 lines , even at the edge of the field , had significantly higher signal - to - noises , with @xmath34 , yielding a mean centroiding error of only 2.4 kms^-1km@xmath11s@xmath12  for these 15 galaxies .",
    "the v and i images were acquired at the wiyn 0.9-m telescope in f/13.5 mode ( 043 pix@xmath12 ) ; integrations were 600s in each filter .",
    "isophotal brightness errors are @xmath35 at , or below , 26.5 in v and i. the imaging was obtained in non - photometric conditions ( thin wisps covered the arizona desert sky ) and thus can not readily be merged into the shellflow imaging data base .",
    "structural parameters can still be measured accurately , down to deep levels , as we discuss below .",
    "three previously observed sb ( ngc 2540 , ugc 5141 , ugc 8229 ) and two sab ( ngc 3029 , ugc 6895 ) shellflow galaxies with available long - slit spectra and v , i photometry were duplicated at the wiyn telescopes for comparison .",
    "these observations enable us to tie the sparsepak velocity field information with the shellflow long - slit spectra obtained with the kpno & ctio 4 m telescopes + rc spec ( courteau et  al .",

    "azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profiles were extracted for all the galaxies using ellipse fitting with a fixed center .",
    "to ensure a homogeneous computation of structural parameters and color gradients , we use the position angles and ellipticities of our i - band isophotal maps to determine the sb profiles in the v - band .",
    "the position angle and ellipticity are allowed to vary at each isophote",
    ". please refer to courteau ( 1996 ) for details about our surface brightness extraction technique .",
    "reduction techniques for the extraction of rotation curves from long - slit spectra are described in courteau ( 1997 ) .",
    "we shall simply state that the 1-d rotation curve is constructed by measuring an intensity - weighted centroid at each resolved major - axis  emission feature above a noise threshold . for the 2-d sparsepak data , a single , inclined , differentially rotating , circular disk model with a fixed center",
    "is used to fit the h@xmath0 velocity fields ( andersen & bershady 2003 ) .",
    "briefly , we assume a radially symmetric rotation curve and an axisymmetric velocity field . using this smooth functional representation of the velocity field , we compared the model velocity field to observations .",
    "parameters are varied using a multi - dimensional down - hill simplex method ( press et  al .",
    "1992 ) to minimize a @xmath36 statistic .",
    "our velocity field model has nine free parameters : seven for the rotation curve ( see next paragraph ) , and two for inclination and position angle .",
    "two additional parameters account for positional offsets from differential telescope pointing errors for each sparsepak position , yet in practice these parameters were consistent with zero and were thereafter not allowed to vary .",
    "we parameterize the model used to fit the rotation curves of both the 1-d ( long slit ) and 2-d ( sparsepak ) velocity field data with the following empirical function ( courteau 1997 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the velocity and spatial centers of rotation , @xmath41 is an asymptotic velocity , and @xmath42 is a transition radius between the rising and flat part of the rotation curve .",
    "solid - body rotation , or @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 ) , is recovered for @xmath45 , and flat rotation , or @xmath46 , is achieved for @xmath47 .",
    "the term @xmath48 governs the degree of sharpness of turnover , and @xmath49 can be used to model the drop - off or steady rise of the outer part of the rotation curve .",
    "table  1 gives velocity field and structural parameters for the sparsepak data collected at wiyn in march 2002 .",
    "listed are the number @xmath50 of velocity data points , the kinematic and photometric inclinations , the kinematic and photometric position angles , the velocity fit parameters , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath49 , and @xmath48 ( see eq .  1 )",
    ", the bar radius , @xmath51 in the plane of the galaxy , the i - band scale length @xmath52 of the disk , and the recessional velocity of the galaxy , @xmath39 . the bar radius is defined as the location where the i - band surface brightness drops and/or position angle changes abruptly .",
    "disk scale lengths were determined as in macarthur et  al .",
    "no photometric parameters are listed for ic 0784 which could not be observed at the telescope due to time and weather constraints .",
    "appendix a contains rotation curves and extracted velocity fields ( spider diagrams ) for the wiyn / sparsepak galaxies .",
    "the model rotation curves , based on eq .",
    "( 1 ) , are a decent match to most extracted integral field velocity data points .",
    "these models are shown mostly for illustrative purposes and for comparison with similar fits to rotation curves derived from long - slit spectra .",
    "they can also be used for future dynamical modeling .    the overall impression from the comparison of velocity data for the 5 shellflow galaxies with long - slit 1-d and sparsepak 2-d rotation curves in appendix a",
    "is very favorable . for ngc 2540 ( ) ,",
    "the 1-d and 2-d velocity models are indistinguishable , owing in part to the very similar position angles and inclinations used to extract the velocity amplitudes .",
    "the unbarred galaxy , ngc 3029 ( ) , was re - observed for consistency check ; again the velocity data and models agree very well within the measurement uncertainty .",
    "ngc 5141 shows only slight differences in the modeled rcs , and ugc 6895 and ugc 8229 show slightly larger differences in the inner slopes , perhaps caused by a misaligned slit .",
    "while the data distributions agree within their respective scatter , the rc models predict different maximum rotation speeds , at the 10 - 20 kms^-1km@xmath11s@xmath12  level .",
    "however , the basic impression to retain for this comparison is that long - slit and ifs rotation curves agree well within their measurement errors and intrinsic scatter and it can be assumed that line widths from 1-d rotation curves are a fair representation of the overall velocity field , even for barred galaxies .",
    "close agreement between 1-d rotation curves from  long - slit spectra and major - axis rotation curves from fabry - perot ( 2-d ) velocity fields was also demonstrated by courteau ( 1997 ) .",
    "another concern , when mapping the kinematic and dynamic structure of barred galaxies , is whether our diagnostics are affected by non - circular velocities , radial flows , and/or isophotal distortions . in order to assess the importance of non - circular motions , we have examined minor - axis rotation curves ( not shown here for simplicity ) and spider diagrams in appendix",
    "a ( see also swaters et  al .",
    "the minor - axis rotation curves are consistent with 1020 kms^-1km@xmath11s@xmath12  velocity dispersions of the turbulent gas with little hint of systematic deviations .",
    "the spider diagrams do show signs of non - circular motions , especially within @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , beyond the extent or reach of the bar , most position - velocity diagrams are symmetric about the major kinematic axis . with the exception of ic 2104 ( ) ,",
    "a symmetric velocity pattern is recovered for all galaxies at , and beyond , @xmath7 .",
    "the good match between 1-d and 2-d velocity fields and lack of significant non - circular motions at or beyond @xmath7 suggests that we can compare raw rotation speeds of barred and unbarred galaxies , all other quantities being equal , without significant bias .",
    "this is what we do in for the shellflow and scii data .",
    "any putative offset of the barred galaxies in the tf plane should not be due to systematic effects in the line widths .",
    "deprojection of velocity fields requires an inclination estimate .",
    "tf studies usually make use of photometric inclinations determined in the outer disk , away from a bar or spiral distortions , where ellipticities and position angles do not vary appreciably ( courteau 1996 , beauvais & bothun 2001 ) .",
    "we compare our sparsepak kinematic and i - band photometric inclination and position angle estimates in and table 1 .",
    "a position angle offset would systematically lower the observed long - slit rotation , and inclination differences could displace a galaxy in the tf plane .",
    "we find that galaxies with @xmath54  show no appreciable inclination offset ( within 3  rms ) and a mild position angle offset ( 10  rms ) between kinematic and photometric estimates .",
    "position angle differences can be large for more face - on galaxies but our sample is too small to isolate systematic trends .    for galaxies with @xmath55 ,",
    "photometric inclination angles are , on average , @xmath56 larger ( more edge - on ) than kinematic estimates .",
    "inclination offsets for the low - inclination unbarred galaxy ngc 3029 are large and can only be explained by model fitting ( kinematic vs isophotal ) differences , whereas excellent agreement is found for ugc 6895 , a higher inclination ( @xmath57 ) unbarred galaxy .",
    "note that our velocity model assumes circular , instead of elliptical , orbits .",
    "kinematic inclinations are still precise enough to construct a tfr with small scatter ( @xmath58 even at very low inclinations ( andersen & bershady 2003 ) .",
    "it is however unclear which of the kinematic or photometric inclination is more `` representative '' of the disk projection on the sky .",
    "the inclination offset may result from a combination of kinematic modeling that favors more circular orbits and great sensitivity of the isophotal mapping technique to @xmath59 brightness perturbations .",
    "spiral arms typically originate at the ends ( ilr ) of bars and retain a small pitch angle , highly noticeable in the brightness distribution , hence the plausible bias towards higher photometric inclinations .",
    "these effects are especially acute when spiral arms are fully resolved .    in a similar study , sakai et  al .",
    "( 2000 ; h@xmath60  key project ) find that photometric and kinematic ( radio synthesis mapping ) inclination angles differ for barred galaxies . among the 21 calibrator galaxies in their tf sample ,",
    "7 are barred and their kinematic inclination angles are @xmath61 10 - 15% smaller than photometric inclinations .",
    "their barred galaxies all have @xmath62 .",
    "however , inclination offsets for their unbarred galaxies are nearly absent .",
    "peletier & willner ( 1991 ) give radio and infrared inclination angles for 13 barred and unbarred nearby spirals with 27@xmath6370 .",
    "radio synthesis inclinations are also @xmath6112  smaller than photometric estimates , but for all inclinations .    to illustrate this potentially confusing situation , we plot in the inclination difference , @xmath64 ( kin  phot ) , against kinematic inclination for the galaxy samples considered above , plus a sample of nearby , face - on , unbarred spiral galaxies ( andersen 2001 ) .",
    "at low inclinations , kinematic inclinations appear to be systematically lower ( more face - on ) than photometric inclinations , with a trend of increasing differences with decreasing inclination .",
    "this is made very clear by examination of andersen s data . at high inclinations ,",
    "both barred and unbarred galaxies have smaller inclinations offsets , apparently independent of inclination . at these high inclinations , the effect on the velocity deprojection is negligible ( @xmath65% ) .",
    "it may be that sparsepak and photometric inclinations in these inclined galaxies are affected by extinction as higher opacity would naturally bias high optically - determined inclinations .",
    "however , the radio synthesis inclinations compiled in sakai et  al .",
    "are insensitive to dust and the inclination difference is most likely explained by modeling differences ; 2-d velocity fields are modeled under the assumption of circular orbits and the larger kinematic inclinations at large inclination may result from an underestimate of the disk thickness .",
    "in general , with increasing inclination , photometric inclinations become increasingly sensitive to the estimated disk thickness while velocity fields ( especially radio velocity fields ) become increasingly affected by warps and other non - circular motions . in any event ,",
    "the inclination differences at @xmath66  are small ( @xmath67 ) and do not affect our study .",

    "opposite trends are found in the compilation of peletier & willner ( 1991 ) if all their data are considered .",
    "inclination offsets are large even at high inclinations .",
    "this discrepancy however hinges on three galaxies , ngc 4178 , 4192 , and 4216 , that display various pathologies .",
    "ngc 4178 is a very late type system , ngc 4192 has a strong warp in the outer disk , and ngc 4216 has a very pronounced dust - lane ; these all make photometric measurements uncertain .",
    "if we ignore the peletier & willner data ( bottom panel ; ) , we find that the transition threshold where kinematic inclinations becomes significantly lower than photometric inclinations depends on type : @xmath68 , 40 , and 30   for barred , weakly - barred , and unbarred galaxies .    clearly , a more extensive 2-d spectroscopic survey of barred and unbarred galaxies in the near - infrared and radio will help address our general concerns about their dynamical structure and the limitations of our modeling techniques .",
    "infrared imaging should also be secured for extinction - free inclination measurements .",
    "the measurement of a `` true '' inclination of a galaxy is certainly ill - defined as it depends on the bandpass , dust extinction , the detector , reduction methods , and assumptions concerning the galaxy structure ( e.g. presence of warps ) . yet , inclination angles from radio synthesis mapping may come closest to the most representative tilt angle of a galaxy on the sky .    as we await",

    "the exact choice of distance scale does not affect our conclusions . according to the rc3 ,",
    "37% of the shellflow sample is barred ( sb types only ) . in general , the proportion of galaxies with bars of all sizes is even higher ( eskridge et  al .",
    "2002 ) but we are here only concerned with galaxies with the strongest bars ; those with potentially the highest central baryon fraction .",

    "it could be explained if barred galaxies have higher star formation rates .",
    "however , phillips ( 1996 ) and kennicutt ( 1999 ) find that global star formation rates in barred and unbarred galaxies of the same hubble type are comparable .",
    "the tf offset , if real , might also be consistent with maximal disks being brighter than their dark - matter dominated counter - parts at a given mass .",
    "a clearer picture is obtained with the larger scii sample ( ) which shows no offset from the mean tfr for scii barred galaxies .",
    "the combined velocity offset for the shellflow and scii barred galaxies in the two samples is @xmath84 , consistent with no deviation of the mean tfr .",
    "note that photometric inclinations are used to deproject velocities in shellflow and scii but using kinematic inclinations instead would simply imply a readjustment of the tf zero - point .",
    "provided only one inclination measure is used , the relative distribution of barred and unbarred tf galaxies is not affected by the precise choice of inclination ( ) . recall that all the shellflow and scii barred galaxies have @xmath1  and are not affected by a putative ( kin - phot ) inclination offset .",
    "furthermore , if we exclude the few unbarred galaxies that have @xmath85  from the shellflow and scii samples , the tf distributions remain the same .",
    "thus , we conclude that _ barred galaxies lie on the same tfr as unbarred galaxies .",

    "cr99 developed and applied a test for correlated scatter of the tfr . according to this test",
    ", pure stellar exponential ( maximal ) disks should deviate from the mean tf and luminosity - size ( ls ) relations in such a way that @xmath88 .",
    "thus , strongly correlated tf / ls residuals for the barred spirals would support the suggestion that unbarred spirals have sub - maximal disks ( high concentration halos ) and that maximal disks are only found , on average , in barred spirals .",
    "a new analysis based on the shellflow and scii data sets yields residuals that are consistent with @xmath89 for both barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "cr99 found a similar result for the courteau - faber sample .",
    "this result further confirms earlier observations about spiral galaxies : barred and unbarred galaxies have similar physical properties and populate the same tf / ls relation and residual space .",
    "it also shows that the tfr is fully independent of surface brightness ( cr99 ) , a situation which may also result from the fine - tuning of virial parameters .",
    "the analysis of the independence of surface brightness in the tfr , and a revised interpretation of the `` courteau - rix '' test in terms of virial parameter correlations , is presented in courteau et  al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "we have tested the hypothesis that barred and unbarred spiral disks have different structural correlations , such as the tully - fisher relation , with barred galaxies possibly having a higher luminous - to - dark matter fraction in their inner parts .",
    "new wiyn / sparsepak integral field spectroscopy and deep near - infrared photometry of barred and unbarred spirals allowed us to verify that non - circular motions are not significant at @xmath7 and that rotation curves from 1-d or 2-d spectroscopy are reliable beyond that radius .",
    "based on this result , and uniform inclination corrections for spiral galaxies with @xmath1 , we have compared the distribution of barred and unbarred galaxies in the tf plane from extensive redshift - distance surveys of galaxies and found no significant differences .    for a given circular velocity , barred and unbarred",
    "galaxies have comparable luminosities , scale lengths , colors , and star formation rates .",
    "this suggests that barred and unbarred galaxies are close members of the same family and do not originate from different evolutionary trees .",
    "their structural duality may be understood if bars are generated by transient dynamical processes that are likely independent of the initial galaxy formation conditions .",
    "their virial properties would otherwise be different .",
    "very recent n - body simulations with the highest resolution have relaxed the notion that bars would grow in structures defined by a narrow range of disk / halo parameters .",
    "thus our comparisons can not be used to ascertain the notion that bars live mostly in spiral disks whose stellar fraction dominates the mass budget within the optical disk .",
    "our results are however consistent with bright barred galaxies having similar dark matter fractions as do their unbarred cousins ( debattista & sellwood 2000 ; courteau et  al .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions , which provide robust disk @xmath3 ratios , hold the promise of breaking the disk / halo degeneracy in mass modeling of barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "if the presence of bars in rotating disks is not directly related to their virial structure but rather to their local dynamical state , it can surely be used as a signpost of galaxy evolution .",
    "given that bars may be just as important as mergers in shaping field disk galaxies , significant efforts should be invested in programs to probe differences between barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "bars , which can be triggered spontaneously by the global dynamical instability of a rotationally supported disk , can also be induced by interactions with a satellite .",
    "one might thus expect an _ increase _ of the fraction of barred disks at higher redshift , unless these younger disks are too dynamically hot to sustain bar unstable modes .",
    "van den bergh et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) studied the visibility of bars in the northern hubble deep field ( hdf - n ) and reported a _ dearth _ of bars at @xmath90 in the rest - frame v - band .",
    "taken at face value , this could indicate a dependence of bar strength on the local galaxy density which grows with time .",
    "however , a similar study by sheth et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) based on the nicmos deep field reveals numerous strongly barred galaxies up to @xmath91 .",
    "extinction effects in the bluer band explored by van den bergh et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) thus thwarted their ability to detect dust enshrouded bars .",
    "given the detection of stable disks beyond @xmath92 ( van dokkum & stanford 2001 ; genzel et  al .",
    "2003 ) , it is thus reasonable to posit the existence of bars at comparably high redshifts .",
    "the cosmological volumes sampled in two hdf studies above are very small and robust statistics on the barredness of galaxies with look - back time awaits wider coverage and more extensive sky surveys , especially with telescopes like alma within the next decade .",
    "closer to home and on shorter time scales , our comparison of a few dozen barred galaxies with tf samples of unbarred disks should soon be superceded , it is wished , by systematic studies of structural and environmental properties of thousands of barred and unbarred galaxies in the sloan and 2mass galaxy catalogs . only with such large - scale , systematic local investigations can we make significant progress in mapping galaxy evolution at high - redshift and linking the near and far - field universe .",

    "this second , `` wedge , '' approach is relatively insensitive to inclination - induced beam smearing which affects the simulated slit measurements .",
