    "the top quark detection at the fermilab tevatron @xcite greatly boosted the interest in top quark physics .",
    "the large mass of this quark suggests that it could be very sensitive to new physics effects , which may manifest themselves through anomalous rates for its production and decay modes .",
    "although some properties of the top quark have already been examined at the tevatron @xcite , a further scrutiny is expected at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . this machine will operate as a veritable top quark factory , producing about eight millions of @xmath5 events per year in its first stage , and hopefully up to about eighteen millions in subsequent years @xcite . yet in the first stage of the lhc , many rare processes involving the top quark are expected to be accessible .",
    "it is thus worth investigating all of the top quark decays within the standard model ( sm ) in order to find out any scenario that may be highly sensitive to new physics effects .    in the sm",
    ", the main decay channel of the top quark is @xmath6 .",
    "although the nondiagonal @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes are more suppressed , they still have sizable branching ratios .",
    "for instance , @xmath9 is of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "as far as rare decays are concerned , the three - body tree - level induced modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are strongly dependent on the precise value of the top quark mass .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath12 decays are severely gim - suppressed @xcite , but @xmath15 can have a branching ratio of the order of @xmath16 for a top quark mass larger than @xmath17 gev @xcite .",
    "this decay mode has been suggested as a probe for the top quark mass because it is almost in the threshold region @xcite . at the one - loop level , there arise the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 , which are considerably gim - suppressed , with branching ratios ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "motivated by the fact that any process that is forbidden or strongly suppressed within the sm constitutes a natural laboratory to search for any new physics effects , fcnc top quark decays have been the subject of considerable interest in the literature @xcite .",
    "it turns out that they may have large branching ratios , much larger than the sm ones , within some extended theories such as the two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) @xcite , supersymmetry ( susy ) models with nonuniversal soft breaking @xcite , susy models with broken @xmath23-parity @xcite , and even more exotic scenarios @xcite .",
    "similar results for the decays @xmath18 and @xmath20 were obtained within the context of effective theories @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present a calculation of the @xmath24 decay ( @xmath25 stands for the @xmath26 or @xmath27 quark ) , which arises at the one - loop level in the sm .",
    "although the study of rare top quark transitions has attracted considerable attention , to our knowledge the rare decay @xmath28 has never been analyzed before .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the analytical calculation of the decay @xmath29 .",
    "the numerical results and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "iii along with the final remarks .",
    "decays of the type @xmath28 proceed through the reducible diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ feyndiag]@xmath30 , which are mediated by the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 bosons .",
    "while those feynman diagrams mediated by the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bosons are enhanced due to the fact that the intermediary boson is on resonance ( provided that @xmath35 ) , those diagrams mediated by the photon ( gluon ) are enhanced by the effect of the photon ( gluon ) pole .",
    "there are also contributions from box diagrams carrying @xmath36 gauge bosons and down quarks [ see fig .",
    "[ feyndiag]@xmath37 .",
    "since each type of diagram renders a finite amplitude by its own , the different contributions can be considered as independent .",
    "it can be shown that the @xmath28 decay is essentially determined by those graphs involving a virtual gluon , i.e. , those reducible diagrams involving the one - loop vertex @xmath2 and the tree - level vertex @xmath38 .",
    "the role played by this contribution is evident from the fact that it constitutes an electroweak - qcd mixed effect .",
    "this is to be contrasted with those reducible graphs mediated by the @xmath33 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 bosons , as well as the box diagrams , which are entirely determined by electroweak couplings . as a consequence ,",
    "the pure electroweak contributions become suppressed by a factor of @xmath39 as compared with the electroweak - qcd mixed ones .",
    "feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath40 decay .",
    "the bubble stands for all the contributions of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ feynd2].,width=336 ]    once the most relevant properties of the @xmath28 decay were described , we would like to emphasize a noteworthy feature of this process .",
    "it is closely related to the fact that the @xmath28 decay is mediated by a virtual massless vector boson , i.e. , the gluon or the photon . without losing generality , it is enough to discuss the gluon contribution as it is the dominant one .",
    "naively , one would expect that the rate for the two - body decay @xmath41 is larger than that for the three - body decay @xmath0 , which in fact is not true .",
    "this stems from the fact that while the on - shell @xmath3 vertex is characterized by a dipole structure ( the @xmath42 pair couples to the gluon through the gauge tensor @xmath43 ) , the corresponding off - shell @xmath2 vertex involves also a monopole structure ( the @xmath42 pair interacts directly with the @xmath44 gauge field ) .",
    "therefore , while the @xmath41 transition is entirely determined by the dipole structure , both the dipole and the monopole structures contribute to the @xmath28 process .",
    "it turns out that the contribution from the monopolar term can be considerably larger than that arising from the dipolar one .",
    "we have found that this is indeed the case for the rare decay @xmath28 .",
    "it means that while the @xmath41 decay is determined by the dipolar term , the @xmath28 mode is governed by the monopolar one .",
    "moreover , the three - body decay is unsuppressed because it includes the qcd vertex @xmath38 , which is much less suppressed than the electroweak vertices @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the above properties nicely conspire to enhance the @xmath28 decay rate by about one order of magnitude with respect to that of the @xmath41 transition .",
    "feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath47 vertex in the unitary gauge . in the @xmath48 gauge",
    "there are an extra set of diagrams in which the @xmath36 boson is replaced by its associate pseudogoldstone boson.,width=336 ]    we now turn to analyze the general structure of the @xmath3 vertex , which is generated at the one - loop level via the feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ feynd2 ] . the most general form of this vertex involves up to ten form factors , which are associated with the lorentz structures @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , with @xmath54 .",
    "there are however a few independent form factors .",
    "after imposing the on - shell conditions on the fermionic fields , the gordon identities allows one to eliminate the four form factors associated with @xmath50 and @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath55 condition , valid for a real gluon , can be safely used as the off - shell gluon couples to a pair of approximately massless quarks .",
    "thus , the only non negligible contributions to the the @xmath0 decay are those of the monopolar ( @xmath49 ) and dipolar ( @xmath56 ) terms .",
    "furthermore , no contributions proportional to @xmath57 can arise in the @xmath58 limit .",
    "consequently , the vertex function associated with the @xmath3 coupling can be written as    @xmath59,\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 is the coupling constant and @xmath61 stand for the generators associated with the color group .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the monopolar contribution @xmath62 vanishes in the on - shell limit as a consequence of the ward identity @xmath63 .",
    "this means that a fcnc vertex involving an on - shell gluon can only arise through a dipolar term , such as occurs in electrodynamics .",
    "this is not true for an off - shell gluon : in such a case the monopolar term yields the dominant contribution .",
    "this behavior will be explicitly shown below .",
    "we will first calculate the form factors in an @xmath48 gauge and , in order to assure that our result is gauge - independent , we will also calculate such form factors via the unitary gauge . in the @xmath48",
    "gauge the calculation leads to the following amplitude    @xmath64    where @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67[(k+p_1)^2-m^2_i][(k+p_2)^2-m^2_i],\\\\ & & \\delta_2=[k^2-m^2_w][(k+p_2)^2-m^2_i],\\\\ & & \\delta_3=[k^2-m^2_w][(k+p_1)^2-m^2_i],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath68[(k+p_1)^2-m^2_i][(k+p_2)^2-m^2_i],\\\\ & & \\delta_5=[k^2-\\xi m^2_w][(k+p_2)^2-m^2_i],\\\\ & & \\delta_6=[k^2-\\xi m^2_w][(k+p_1)^2-m^2_i],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath69 in the previous expressions , the @xmath58 approximation was used .",
    "in addition , @xmath70 denotes the mass of the internal down quark and @xmath71 is the gauge parameter . for simplicity",
    "the calculation was performed in the thooft - feynman gauge ( @xmath72 ) . as a crosscheck",
    ", we also have performed the calculation via the unitary gauge(@xmath73 ) , in which there are only contributions from the first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) , with @xmath74 replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "the results obtained by these two calculation schemes do coincide , which guarantees that the form factors associated with the monopolar and dipolar structures of the @xmath2 vertex are gauge - independent . introducing the definition @xmath76 we can write    @xmath77    where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81 functions depend on @xmath82 and read    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    and @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91    in writing the above expressions , the unitarity condition @xmath92 was taken into account , i.e. , any term independent of the internal quark mass was dropped out . also , it is straightforward to show that @xmath93 for @xmath94 , which means that , as expected , the @xmath95 amplitudes are free of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "we now are ready to calculate the contribution of the @xmath2 vertex to the @xmath0 decay .",
    "below , @xmath96 and @xmath97 will stand for the 4-momenta associated with the @xmath98 and @xmath99 quarks .",
    "it is useful to introduce the following dimensionless variable @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath101 quark mass will be retained in the phase space integral since a factor of @xmath102 , associated with the gluon pole , enters into the @xmath24 squared amplitude .",
    "using the expressions for the @xmath2 and @xmath103 vertices , it is straightforward to construct the invariant amplitude associated with the diagram @xmath30 of fig .",
    "[ feyndiag ] . after making this ,",
    "we can write the invariant mass distribution @xmath104 as follows @xmath105 with the squared amplitude being @xmath106    as far as the @xmath107 functions are concerned , they are given by @xmath108 whereas the passarino - veltman scalar functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 are , in the usual notation : @xmath111    the integration limits are as follows @xmath112    @xmath113    where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .    from eq .",
    "( [ amplitudes ] ) it is evident that @xmath116 , the monopole term , vanishes in the on - shell limit ( @xmath117 ) , in agreement with the fact that the @xmath41 decay is only determined by a dipole term .",
    "we will show below that the monopole contribution is slightly larger than the dipole one .    since the @xmath95 amplitudes do not depend on @xmath118 , this variable can be integrated over readily . in the @xmath119 limit ,",
    "we are left with @xmath120 where @xmath121    it is interesting to note that we will not take into account the limiting case @xmath119 ( @xmath122 ) when integrating over @xmath123 because the @xmath104 distribution would become undefined in @xmath124 due to the gluon pole .",
    "this corresponds to the case when the @xmath98 quark emerges parallel to @xmath99 and we can not take the limit of massless @xmath98 quark as it would lead to a collinear singularity .",
    "thus , although we have neglected the outgoing quark masses in the transition amplitude , they must be retained in the integration limits of the @xmath123 variable .",
    "for the numerical analysis we will use the values of the running coupling constant @xmath125 and quark masses at the @xmath126 scale , namely , @xmath127 , @xmath128 gev , @xmath129 gev , @xmath130 gev , @xmath131 gev , @xmath132 gev , and @xmath133 gev @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the numerical results do not change considerably for small variations of the outgoing quark masses .",
    "we first would like to compare the size of the off - shell @xmath2 vertex with that of the on - shell one .",
    "numerical evaluation shows that the @xmath3 dipole contribution is two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath2 monopole contribution and one order smaller than the @xmath2 dipole contribution .",
    "thus , while the @xmath41 decay only receives the contribution of the dipolar term , the @xmath0 transition receives an extra contribution of the monopolar term , which is slightly larger than the dipolar contribution .",
    "the fact that the contribution of the monopole form factor to the @xmath2 vertex is larger than that of the dipole one is exhibited in the invariant mass distribution @xmath134 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ plot ] , where we have plotted separately the monopolar and dipolar contributions .",
    "therefore , it is evident that the @xmath28 decay is slightly dominated by the monopolar term .",
    "monopolar and dipolar contributions to the @xmath29 invariant mass distribution @xmath104.,width=336 ]    we now turn to the numerical evaluation of @xmath135 . using the values given above and @xmath136 gev , we obtain @xmath137 on the other hand , according to the literature @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "this result shows that @xmath139 is about of the same order of magnitude than @xmath140 .",
    "if one sums over all the possible @xmath141 pairs , the resulting @xmath139 is of the order of @xmath142 and thus larger than @xmath143 .",
    "although these decay rates seem exceedingly small to be detected ever , they may be largely enhanced in some sm extensions .",
    "in such a case the effect discussed above may have some interesting implications .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown the interesting fact that three - body decay @xmath0 has a branching ratio about the same order of magnitude than the one of the two - body decay @xmath41 .",
    "although rare decays of this type are very suppressed in the sm , they may have much larger branching ratios in other sm extensions , thereby constituting an interesting place to search for any new physics effects .",
    "after this work was submitted , a preprint was posted to the preprint archive by eilam , frank and turan@xcite , who evaluate the @xmath144 and @xmath0 decays .",
    "although these authors do not presente explicit analytical expressions for the @xmath0 decay @xcite , our numerical result for the branching ratio agrees with theirs .",
    "we have also learnt that deshpande , margolis and trottier presented a similar analysis in @xcite .",
    "these authors reached a similar conclusion on the @xmath145 decay in both the standard and the two - higgs doublet models .",
