    "in the black - hole physics hawking radiation@xcite is always a very important conception which indicates that black - holes are not perfect black , but radiate thermally and eventually explode .",
    "an in - depth discussion of derivation can be obtained in ref.@xcite as for the recent research , one can refer to ref.@xcite many researchers have developed various methods and techniques to study the black - hole by using the radiating particles , such as the simple klein - gordon particles and dirac particles ( for some early works , see damour and ruffini@xcite and chandrasekhar@xcite respectively ) .",
    "recently , as for scalar field , higuchi et al.@xcite and grispino et al.@xcite gave its solution outside a schwarzschild black - hole , brady et al.@xcite studied the schwarzschild - de sitter case and guo et al.@xcite made further studies in the reissner - nordstr@xmath0m - de sitter one .",
    "the schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) space is a spherically symmetric system.@xcite it can be treated as a small schwarzschild black - hole embedded in de sitter universe . in this space",
    "there are two horizons : one is inner black - hole horizon @xmath1 and the other is outer cosmological horizons @xmath2 . in 2001 ,",
    "brevik and simonsen@xcite gave a massless scalar field solution by tangent approximation which contains an explicit tangent function .",
    "viewing from the global frame , this method matches @xmath3 with @xmath4 very well , where @xmath3 is the radial coordinate and @xmath4 is a fitting function . however , its insufficiency is the weak fitting near the two horizons . even in the intermediate zone , the fitting @xmath3 with @xmath4 is not precise enough . in their paper,@xcite",
    "they have studied for two extreme cases whose horizons are either very close to each other or lie very far away .",
    "afterwards , tian et al@xcite used a polynomial approximation containing 20 monomials and gave another different numerical solution only in the extreme nariai black - hole .",
    "this useful polynomial approximation is more precise than the tangent approximation .",
    "especially , in the leading intermediate zone , the fitting @xmath3 with a polynomial makes a good match .",
    "however , this type of approximation rapidly deteriorates near the horizons , i.e. inappropriate boundary conditions are used . on the other hand ,",
    "the widely separated horizons case is not considered in ref.@xcite considering the above situation , we re - study the scattering of a scalar field with polynomial approximation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the schwarzschild - de sitter space and point out the positions of black - hole horizon and cosmological horizon . in section 3 , by the polynomial approximation , the full sturm - liouville type problems are solved for two extreme cases .",
    "section 4 is a conclusion .",
    "we adopt the signature @xmath5 and put @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 equal to unity .",
    "the same setting of field parameters is employed in ref.@xcite",
    "the spherically symmetric metric of the schwarzschild - de sitter space@xcite is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 with the black - hole mass @xmath11 and the cosmological constant @xmath12 .",
    "it is an exact exterior solution of the einstein field equations for a spherical mass distribution @xmath13 here , we take the cosmological constant @xmath12 as a free parameter .",
    "the similar process can be found in refs.@xcite this space is bounded by two horizons  an inner horizon ( black - hole horizon ) and an outer horizon ( cosmological horizon ) . under the limit @xmath14 ,",
    "this metric has exactly the same line - element as the schwarzschild space .",
    "but in the limit of @xmath15 , it reduces to the de sitter one .",
    "mathematically , expression ( [ f - function ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath16 the singularity of metric ( [ metric ] ) is determined by @xmath17 . the solutions to this equation",
    "are these to inner horizon @xmath1 and outer horizon @xmath2 , as well as a negative solution @xmath18 .",
    "the last one has no physical meaning .",
    "here we only consider the positive solutions .",
    "the positions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "the real physical solutions are accepted only if @xmath12 satisfies @xmath22.@xcite if the cosmological constant @xmath12 reaches its maximum , the nariai black - hole appears.@xcite    a massless scalar field @xmath23 is considered here . using",
    "the separable solutions@xcite @xmath24 the scalar field equation @xmath25 is decomposed into two differential equations : @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the time - dependent radial function and @xmath29 is the spherical harmonics function .",
    "equation ( [ radius - t - equation ] ) determines the evolution of evaporating black - hole .",
    "it is necessary to eliminate the time variable by the fourier component @xmath30 via @xmath31 so eq.([radius - t - equation ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath32\\psi_{\\omega   l}(r)=\\omega^2\\psi_{\\omega l}(r),\\label{radius equ . about r}\\ ] ] whose potential function is given by@xmath33.\\label{potential - of - r}\\ ] ]    now we introduce the tortoise coordinate@xmath34 the tortoise coordinate can be expressed by surface gravity as follows : @xmath35},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xmath36 explicitly , we have@xmath37 by tortoise coordinate transformation ( [ tortoise ] ) , the radial equation ( [ radius equ . about r ] ) can be written in the @xmath38 form@xmath39\\psi_{\\omega l}(x)=4m^2\\omega^2\\psi_{\\omega l}(x),\\label{radius - equation}\\ ] ] which has the form of schr@xmath0dinger equation of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is usually called schr@xmath0dinger - like equation . the incoming or outgoing particle flow between inner horizon @xmath1 and outer horizon @xmath2 is reflected and transmitted by the potential barrier @xmath40 .",
    "the evolution of wave solution @xmath41 of massless scalar field is also determined by potential @xmath40 .",
    "( triangle - up ) versus the tortoise coordinate @xmath42 with @xmath43.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    according to eqs .",
    "( [ re - f function ] ) and ( [ potential - of - r ] ) , the potential @xmath40 disappears near black - hole horizon @xmath1 and cosmological horizon @xmath2 .",
    "so the potentials near horizons are given as follows : @xmath44 hence near the horizons , eq.([radius - equation ] ) reduces to @xmath45\\psi_{\\omega      l}(x)=0.\\ ] ] absolutely , its solutions are @xmath46 or their comprehensive form . taking the real scalar field@xcite into account , we choose the real part of its solutions as the boundary condition @xmath47    [ f2 ]   versus tortoise coordinate @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where the maximum value is represented by the black point.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    there are two coordinates  radial coordinate @xmath3 and tortoise coordinate @xmath42 contained in eq.([radius - equation ] ) .",
    "however , the source transformation expression ( [ tor - grav - sf ] ) is too complicated to invert it to the form of @xmath50 . in order to solve eq.([radius - equation ] ) conveniently , it is necessary to use an approximate method for transition @xmath51 where the radial coordinate @xmath3 is replaced by the fitting function @xmath4 containing the tortoise coordinate @xmath42 . here",
    "we use the polynomial approximation@xcite to fit @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "this method involves complicated polynomials unlike the explicit tangent approximation.@xcite for any given value of the parameter @xmath12 , we can always find an appropriate approximate method from the above by adjusting the parameters .",
    "the difficulty is how to obtain the fitting function ( [ 1 ] ) . here , we consider the polynomial approximation@xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the coefficient and @xmath54 is the degree of polynomial . in the various fitting functions ,",
    "the greatest advantage of the polynomial approximation is that it can obtain the optimal approximation by the adjustable parameter @xmath54 .",
    "one should note that it is wrong to use the bigger @xmath54 to gain a more accuracy approximation .",
    "@xmath54 must be chosen according to the fitting interval . by combining the potential @xmath55 , the schrdinger - like equation ( [ radius - equation ] ) , fitting function ( [ polynomal ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ nobc ] )",
    ", we can present a full sturm - liouville type problem .",
    "this kind of boundary value problem is usually used to solve the field equation , such as refs.@xcite note that the same setting of field parameters as that in ref.@xcite are adopted in the subsections .       versus the tortoise coordinate",
    "@xmath42 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath49.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    nariai solution has been discovered by nariai,@xcite which is the exact solution to the einstein equation with @xmath58 without a maxwell field .",
    "its topological structure is a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional ds spacetime with a round 2-sphere of fixed radius , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "we adopt the same value @xmath60 as appeared in refs.@xcite then substituting @xmath12 into eq.([re - rc ] ) , we find the inner horizon is @xmath61 and the outer horizon is @xmath62 .",
    "just as in ref.@xcite , we employ the same polynomial approximation here .",
    "the coefficients @xmath63 are showed in table 1 .",
    "[ table ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      with the radial coordinate @xmath3 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath64.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +",
    "we have solved the real scalar field numerically with the polynomial approximation . unlike the previous original work,@xcite we have not only surveyed a more general setting of field parameters , i.e. the widely separated horizons case , but also selected more precise boundary conditions .",
    "we summarize what have been achieved as follows .",
    "1 polynomial approximation is an important and comprehensible approximate method . in this paper",
    "this method has been used to fit the radial coordinate with the tortoise coordinate .",
    "unlike the tangent approximation,@xcite one main merit of this method is that there is an adjustable parameter , the degree of the polynomial .",
    "the degree of the polynomial must be selected to ensure that we can obtain the maximum fitting interval . from the analysis in this paper",
    ", we find that the degree of the polynomial should be reduced with increasing cosmological constant . when we consider two extreme cases with @xmath43 and @xmath65 , the degree should be reduced from 20 to 10 .",
    "2 as for the nariai black - hole , because the potential barrier @xmath40 ( [ potential - of - r ] ) vanishes near the two horizons , eq.([boundary - conditions ] ) becomes a universal boundary condition for real solution case .",
    "but the different fitting intervals need different boundary conditions .",
    "so it has to choose a well and suitable one according to the quality of fitting . in this paper , we have chosen another exact boundary condition .",
    "although the previous polynomial approximation is more accurate to match @xmath3 with @xmath4 in the intermediate zone , the interval of @xmath42 does not keep the original one ( @xmath66 $ ] ) .",
    "it is illustrated clearly in fig.1 .",
    "obviously , when the tortoise coordinate @xmath42 is in the range of @xmath67 $ ] or @xmath68 $ ] , the approximation ( [ polynomal ] ) quickly deteriorates .",
    "so it is necessary to use the new interval @xmath69 $ ] to replace the previous one @xmath66 $ ] . as mentioned in the above sections , by tortoise",
    "coordinate transformation the radial equation can be rewritten as a standard wave equation form . by combining with the real boundary condition ( cosine function form ) , the harmonic wave appears .",
    "otherwise , for the compactness of the tortoise coordinate the waves pile up near the horizons naturally .",
    "these effects in the nariai case in the brevik s work@xcite are subtle and subclinical near the cosmological horizon @xmath2 . after rebuilding the scalar field in this paper",
    ", we find that there is no singular peak in waves , and the waves pile up near the two horizons @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which refreshes previous works in refs.@xcite    3 for the widely separated horizons case , the dimensional version of @xmath56 reads @xmath70 where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the speed of light and @xmath11 is the mass of black - hole . considering a usual stellar black hole , we assume the mass @xmath11 equal to ten sun masses ( i.e. @xmath71 ) . it is known that for the solar system we have @xmath72 substituting the mass @xmath11 and the notation ( [ gmodot ] ) into eq.([dimensionalversion ] ) , we can obtain a dimensional cosmological constant @xmath73 using the same method , we can also obtain the dimensional cosmological constant in the nariai case .",
    "@xmath74 although the values are much larger than the observed value @xmath75 , it is very necessary to further research them .",
    "after all , the space could be a schwarzschild one if we take the observational value @xmath76 .",
