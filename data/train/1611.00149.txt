    "in the course of the past decades , the role of entanglement has evolved into a genuine quantum resource utilized in various quantum communication and computation protocols @xcite .",
    "this evolution has been supported by the formidable progress made on the techniques of generating entanglement in practice .",
    "inevitable and inescapable noise , together with imperfections present in every real experiment , may , however , degrade the intended entangled state .",
    "being able to detect and measure the entanglement content becomes important since any amount of entanglement can be harnessed in non - classical tasks @xcite .",
    "although several theoretical measures have been developed for this purpose @xcite , realizing them in practice remains challenging in general .",
    "the reason is that typically these measures of entanglement contain rather involved , even unphysical , operations or are non - linear functions of the state .",
    "one of the most widely used measures of entanglement is the so - called concurrence @xcite , which in the case of two qubits in a pure state takes a particularly simple form . despite the mathematical simplicity , the task of quantifying the value of concurrence of an _ unknown _ two - qubit pure state using only a single measurement set - up of a fixed normalized projection - valued measure ( pvm ) is impossible @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , several different procedures circumventing this impossibility have been reported that exploit collective measurements done with simultaneous copies of the state @xcite or utilize the curious relation between concurrence and two - particle interference @xcite .",
    "furthermore , measurements of concurrence that rely on relaxing the aforementioned pvm - criterion have been developed @xcite .    in this study , we propose a local tomographic strategy to quantify the concurrence of _ any _ two - qubit pure state that takes advantage of so - called weak measurements .",
    "we also consider an experimental implementation on an optical set - up that can be deployed to measure the concurrence of two polarization entangled photons using the proposed protocol .",
    "our method is , however , universal in the sense that it works for all two - qubit systems .",
    "the key tools of our proposal are weak measurements and the resulting weak values @xcite .",
    "weak measurements are ( von neumann ) standard measurements @xcite where the coupling strength @xmath0 between the measured system and the measuring pointer is minuscule .",
    "consequently , the disturbance of the weak measurement to any subsequent ( strong ) measurement , usually called post - selection , is negligible . by post - selecting on a particular pure state @xmath1 , in the vanishing interaction strength limit @xmath2",
    ", one can derive the weak value of the observable @xmath3 as @xmath4}}{{\\textrm{tr}\\left[\\rho\\ , |\\varphi \\rangle\\langle \\varphi|\\right]}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the pre - selected ( mixed ) state of the measured system @xcite . throughout this paper , we omit the pre - selection sub - index whenever it is clear from the context .",
    "weak values are intrinsically complex which has already proved useful in characterizing the mathematically observable - independent probability space  @xcite , several quantum paradoxes  @xcite , the quantum state  @xcite , and unobservable quantities such as the geometric phase  @xcite and the non - hermitian operator @xcite ; see also the review papers @xcite .",
    "we show one that may also take advantage of the complex feature of the weak values in assessing the amount of entanglement with a single measurement set - up .",
    "this result builds up on the fact first noted in ref.@xcite that , when a laguerre - gaussian beam is used as the pointer state of the weak measurement , certain weak values can be interpreted as stereographical projections of the bloch sphere onto @xmath6-plane .",
    "let us assume that two observers , alice and bob , are tasked with determining the amount of entanglement in a bipartite state @xmath7 by means of performing local operations .",
    "furthermore , assume that the source generates only pure two - qubit states , that is , @xmath8 for some @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the eigenvectors of pauli operator @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are complex numbers satisfying the normalization @xmath15 .",
    "one of the most widely used entanglement measures in two - qubit systems is the _ concurrence _ @xmath16 . in the case of a pure state @xmath17 , the concurrence @xmath18 takes the simple form @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the reduced density matrix of alice ( bob ) , _",
    "e.g. , _ @xmath21 the concurrence has a one - to - one connection to the von neumann entropy @xcite @xmath22}=-{\\textrm{tr}\\left[\\rho_b \\log_2(\\rho_b)\\right]}\\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-c^2}}{2}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-c^2}}{2}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-c^2}}{2}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-c^2}}{2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and via that to a plethora of other entanglement measures @xcite , which makes it a natural choice of figure of merit for our task .",
    "our main result is to reveal a mathematical relationship between the concurrence and the weak values corresponding to weak measurements of either one of the local observers .",
    "for instance , alice s weak values of the observable @xmath23 , pre - selected on her reduced state @xmath24 and post - selected on either @xmath25 or @xmath10 , read @xmath26}}{{\\textrm{tr}\\left[\\rho_a \\ , |0\\rangle\\langle 0|\\right]}}= \\frac{a_{00 } a_{10}^ * + a_{01 } a_{11}^ * } { |a_{00}|^2+|a_{01}|^2 } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ { \\,_{{\\langle{1}|}}\\langle{\\sigma_x^a}\\rangle_{}^{w } } & : = & \\frac{{\\textrm{tr}\\left [ \\sigma_x^a \\ , \\rho_a \\,|1\\rangle\\langle 1|\\right]}}{{\\textrm{tr}\\left[\\rho_a \\ , |1\\rangle\\langle 1|\\right ] } } = \\frac{a_{00}^ * a_{10 } + a_{01}^ * a_{11 } } { |a_{10}|^2+|a_{11}|^2};\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] see fig.[fig : weak](a ) .    (",
    "a )        ( b )        a weak value may not be well - defined , if its denominator vanishes .",
    "physically this corresponds to receiving no signal on the measuring pointer whatsoever .",
    "we notice that either one of the above weak values being non - vanishing automatically implies that the other one is also non - zero .",
    "therefore , whenever @xmath27 , we may write @xmath28 and solve    @xmath29    where we have used the information @xmath30 . since @xmath31 , we additionally conclude that @xmath32 on the other hand , one of the weak values in eq.([eq : wvs ] ) being zero implies that the other one either also vanishes or is not well - defined .",
    "assume for example that @xmath33 is not well - defined . then @xmath34 implying @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , @xmath35 if @xmath36 is not well - defined .",
    "these observations can also be reproduced from eq.([eq : concwv ] ) as limiting cases . therefore , except for the point @xmath37 , the concurrence , plotted in fig.[fig : weak](b ) , may be determined from eq.([eq : concwv ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the protocol presented works completely locally .",
    "we note in passing that the optimal line passing through the origin @xmath38 in fig.[fig : weak](b ) is @xmath39 .",
    "namely , except for this point , concurrence @xmath18 is a continuous function of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "concurrence is not even a function of two weak values .",
    "namely , with a proper choice of @xmath42 @xmath18 can acquire any value from the interval @xmath43 $ ] , while satisfying @xmath44 . ] using this information , we can verify that @xmath45 is the only line passing through the origin on which @xmath18 attains its maximum value @xmath46 .",
    "this optimal line corresponds to the initial state @xmath24 prepared on the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere in fig.[fig : weak](a ) . on this line ,",
    "eq.([eq : concwv ] ) simplifies to @xmath47 this observation is useful in order to calibrate @xmath16 as close to unity ( or any other value from the interval @xmath43 $ ] ) as desired .",
    "because this process is completely local , the other party ( bob ) can validate the result of this `` optimization '' for instance via state tomography .",
    "determining @xmath18 of arbitrary @xmath17 directly via measurement of only a single set of orthogonal projectors @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 ( kronecker delta ) , is impossible @xcite .",
    "in other words , one can not quantify concurrence of all bipartite states with a single fixed measurement set - up if the measured observable is a pvm .",
    "this is due to the fact that the measured probabilities @xmath51 result in three independent real numbers , which are not in general sufficient to determine @xmath18 , a non - linear function of four complex parameters .",
    "in fact , even deciding if an unknown bipartite state is the entanglement or not requires as many resources as state tomography @xcite .",
    "the relationship between alice s weak values and the concurrence introduced in the previous section suggests that weak measurements allow one to circumvent this impossibility . to extract the real and imaginary parts of the weak value two complementary pointer observables",
    "are usually used @xcite , that is , two separate measurements have to be set up . remarkably however",
    ", it is also possible to quantify both of these components simultaneously by using so - called laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes @xcite as the initial pointer state due to the initial correlations @xcite related to these states .",
    "as alluded in the previous section , the determination of entanglement fails only in problematic cases where @xmath52 .",
    "the vanishing weak values imply that alice s state is simplified to @xmath53 these cases correspond to the states on a line connecting the opposite poles @xmath25 and @xmath10 of the bloch sphere [ see fig.[fig : weak](a ) ] . in our protocol",
    "the set of these states has only minor relevance since mathematically it has null measure ( in the relevant measurable space ) .",
    "accordingly , the impossibility of determining the concurrence of states with a single pvm strategy persist even if these problematic states were excluded .",
    "nevertheless , in these cases a local measurement of the post - selection probabilities can be used to reveal the amount of entanglement in the state @xmath17 .",
    "to this end , alice can measure the relative intensities of the post - selected states to solve the diagonal elements of @xmath24 in eq.([eq : problemstate ] ) .",
    "since this measurement may be done jointly with the weak measurement protocol described above , the whole procedure of determining the entanglement content in @xmath17 can be achieved with a single fixed measurement device . moreover",
    ", the protocol uses only a single fixed pvm as post - selected measurement ; as discussed above , without the preceding weak interaction such an entanglement - measuring strategy would be impossible .",
    "the weak values @xmath33 and @xmath36 , in addition to the intensity measurements described above , give sufficient information to determine the reduced state @xmath24 [ see fig.[fig : weak](a ) ] , in accordance with ref.@xcite .",
    "thus the protocol we presented essentially relies on local tomography of the reduced state of alice ( or bob ) .",
    "simultaneously , it also generalizes the one - qubit pure state tomography described in ref.@xcite for mixed states .",
    "# 1#1| # 1| # 1 # 1 # 1#2| # 1#2#3|| # 1 _ # 1^ in this section we describe a possible optical set - up for determining the concurrence of the polarization entangled state @xmath17 of photon pairs via a weak measurement .",
    "our proposed experimental set - up is illustrated in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath24 weakly interacts with the pointer state via interaction @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the momentum operator along the @xmath56-direction on the cross - sectional plane of the optical beam , @xmath0 is a small interaction strength , and @xmath57 are the eigenprojectors of the pauli operator @xmath58 .",
    "the interaction ( [ eq : interaction ] ) can be implemented using a polarization sagnac interferometer and the interaction strength @xmath0 can be changed by tilting the angle of a mirror inside the interferometer [ see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ] .    .",
    "the initial pointer state is prepared as the laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) mode using a mode converter .",
    "the weak interaction between eigenvectors of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , can be implemented using a polarization sagnac interferometer ( pbs : polarization beam splitter , hwp : half waveplate).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as the initial pointer state , we choose the optical propagation mode with two - dimensional normalized amplitude distribution @xmath60 , which satisfies the paraxial wave equation @xcite .",
    "after weak interaction and post - selection onto @xmath61 @xmath62 or @xmath63 , the intensity distribution @xmath64 of the final pointer state becomes @xmath65 assuming the `` weakness '' condition , @xmath66 ) induces a translational shift of the pointer state with an amount proportional to the weak value @xmath67 along the @xmath56 direction @xcite .",
    "namely , under the weakness condition , eq .  ( [ eq : intensity ] ) can be approximated as @xmath68 where @xmath69 corresponds to the total intensity of the post - selected beams .",
    "if the fundamental gaussian beam is used for the pointer state , we can extract only the real part of the weak value from the shift in the beam average position and an alternative measurement set - up with additional optical components is required to obtain the imaginary part of the weak value from the shift in the beam average momentum .",
    "a more suitable choice for the pointer state for our purpose is ( the first order ) lg beam @xmath70 $ ] , which is a cylindrically symmetric solution of the paraxial wave equation @xcite .",
    "the lg beam can be generated from a gaussian one by using a mode converter , such as a q - plate @xcite or a spatial light modulator @xcite . from eq.([eq : wm - probe ] ) , the averaged value of the position operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 on the cross - sectional plane of the final intensity distribution are calculated as @xmath73 \\,,\\ , \\langle { \\mathsf{q}}_y \\rangle_f & & = \\lambda \\ , \\text{im}[{\\,_{{\\langle{\\varphi}|}}\\langle{\\sigma_x}\\rangle_{}^{w } } ] .",
    "\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using a two - dimensional image sensor as a detector the lg pointer state therefore allows us to simultaneously visualize both the real and the imaginary part of the weak values @xmath74 and @xmath75 without additional optical components @xcite .    in the case of vanishing weak values , where eq.([eq : concwv",
    "] ) can not be used , we can not obtain any information about the entanglement from the averaged shifts of the pointer state .",
    "however , measuring the total intensities @xmath76 of the two post - selected beams with @xmath77 enables us to determine the diagonal elements of the state in eq.([eq : problemstate ] ) . because this can be performed jointly with measurements of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 position operators , we are able to determine the concurrence of the quantum state @xmath17 with a single measurement set - up .    although the lg mode pointer states allow us to determine the concurrence using a single fixed pvm for post - selection , there are some technical difficulties .",
    "the first problem is the mode conversion from the fundamental gaussian mode to the lg mode .",
    "the conversion efficiency is limited by the mode converter and also by the mode coupling coefficient between the incident mode of the photon pairs and the lg mode . to increase the mode - coupling coefficient , a single mode optical fiber is typically used for spatial mode cleaning of the photon pair beam . in this case",
    ", however , fiber coupling loss becomes a serious problem for photon - pair detection .",
    "one practical solution is photon - pair generation via four - wave mixing in the single mode fiber @xcite .",
    "another problem is the low detection efficiency of the typical image sensor and , concurrently , the demand for a large ensemble of states needed to extract the weak values . to obtain the high - contrast two - dimensional intensity distribution",
    ", we have to generate photon pairs with high intensity using pulsed light or a high - gain imaging sensor , such as a cascade of single photon detectors .",
    "we have shown how weak measurements and weak values can be used to quantify the concurrence of any two - qubit pure state .",
    "we demonstrated that the proposed protocol can be performed with a single measurement set - up using a local weak interaction and a laguerre - gaussian mode as the pointer state .",
    "notably , the protocol uses a single fixed pvm as for the post - selection .",
    "in contrast , without the preceding weak interaction , such a measurement of concurrence is impossible @xcite .",
    "we also considered a potential experimental realization for quantifying the concurrence of the polarization entangled state of photon pairs .",
