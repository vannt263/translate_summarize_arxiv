    "critical properties of structurally disordered magnets remain a problem of great interest in condensed matter physics , since real magnetic crystals are usually non ideal . a simple and natural case of disorder",
    "is implemented via the point - like uncorrelated quenched non - magnetic impurities and is experimentally realized as substitutional disorder in uniaxial @xcite as well as in heisenberg @xcite magnets .",
    "examples are given by substitute alloys @xmath3 , @xmath4 for the uniaxial ( ising ) magnets @xcite , and by amorphous magnets @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , transition - metal based magnetic glasses @xcite as well as disordered crystalline materials @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite and eu - chalcogenide solid solutions @xcite for the heisenberg magnets .",
    "the question of a great interest arising here is : does the disorder change critical properties of the systems ?",
    "the answer is given by the famous harris criterion @xcite .",
    "it states , that disorder changes the critical exponents , if the critical exponent @xmath10 of the pure system is positive : @xmath11 . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the critical exponent governing the divergence of correlation length of the corresponding pure system and @xmath13 is the space dimension .    on the base of this inequality",
    ", one can estimate the marginal value @xmath14 for the spin @xmath15-vector model of magnetic systems , such that for @xmath16 the critical exponents remain unchanged by point - like defects whereas for @xmath17 they cross over to new values .",
    "the present estimates for @xmath14 in three dimensions definitely imply @xmath18 : @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite and thus only the pure ising model ( @xmath21 ) is affected by weak point - like uncorrelated disorder at criticality .",
    "but in real magnets one encounters non - idealities of structure , which can not be modelled by simple point - like uncorrelated impurities .",
    "indeed , magnetic crystals often contain defects of a more complex structure : linear dislocations , disclinations , complexes of non - magnetic impurities , embedded in the matrix of the original crystal @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of critical behavior of magnets containing such `` extended '' ( macroscopic ) defects have attracted considerable interest @xcite , however , a systematic experimental analysis still remains to be performed .",
    "one of the possible ways to treat defects that extend through the system being randomly distributed in space but oriented in the same direction is to consider them as quenched @xmath1-dimensional nonmagnetic impurities of parallel orientation .",
    "this was proposed in the work of dorogovtsev @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath22 is associated with point - like defects , and extended parallel linear ( planar ) defects are described by @xmath1 = 1(2 ) . to give an interpretation to the non - integer values of @xmath1",
    ", one may consider patterns of extended defects like aggregation clusters , and treat @xmath1 as the fractal dimension of these clusters @xcite .",
    "however , relation of analytically continued non - integer euclidean dimension to the fractal dimension is not straightforward @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite , that presence of extended impurities leads to a generalized harris criterion , namely , in this case disorder alters the critical behavior of the pure system , if @xmath23 .",
    "if one considers the point - like disorder with @xmath22 , the generalized harris criterion turns to ordinary one cited above .",
    "again , this inequality defines for each value of @xmath1 the critical value @xmath14 , below which the extended disorder alters the universality class .",
    "but now the disorder induced critical behavior of @xmath0 systems holds not only for the ising magnets ( @xmath21 ) but for @xmath24 as well , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( region denoted as  diluted \" in the figure ) .",
    "therefore , the class of magnets where the new critical behavior may be found is not restricted to the uniaxial ones ( @xmath21 ) , but include easy - plane ( @xmath25 ) and heisenberg ( @xmath26 ) systems . thus predicted phenomena of a new universal behavior may be experimentally checked for a wider class of magnets .",
    "( 220,200 ) ( -20,-5 )    another interesting feature of systems with parallel extended defects is that due to the spatial anisotropy they are described by two correlation lengths , one perpendicular , @xmath27 , and one parallel , @xmath28 , to the extended impurities direction @xcite .",
    "as the critical temperature @xmath29 is approached , their divergences are characterized by corresponding critical exponents @xmath30 , @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the reduced distance to the critical temperature @xmath34 .",
    "anisotropic scaling holds also for the spin - spin pair correlation function at @xmath29 and is governed by exponents @xmath35 and @xmath36 . whereas the magnetic susceptibility is isotropic , as far as all order parameter components interact with defects in a similar way",
    "however , the dynamic critical behavior is modified , two times of relaxation in directions perpendicular and parallel to the extended impurities @xmath37 and @xmath38 behave correspondingly as : @xmath39 with dynamical exponents @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , magnets with quenched extended defects of parallel orientation constitute a large class of systems with a bulk of unusual phenomena worth to be analyzed .",
    "their asymptotic critical behavior was a subject of the field - theoretical renormalization group ( rg ) analyses @xcite .",
    "in particular , a double expansion in both @xmath42 , @xmath1 was suggested and rg functions were calculated @xcite to order @xmath43 , @xmath1 ; qualitatively , the crossover to a new universality class in the presence of extended defects was supported .",
    "these calculations were extended to the second order in refs .",
    "however , these divergent rg expansion did not give a reliable numerical estimate for the critical exponents - the goal highly desirable both for experimental and simulational purposes .",
    "numerical estimates for the exponents describing _ static _ critical behavior of @xmath0 magnets with parallel extended impurities were obtained only recently @xcite by applying special resummation technique to the two - loop rg functions of refs .",
    "currently , no estimates of similar accuracy exist for the _ dynamic _ exponents describing critical slowing down in the magnets under consideration .",
    "the theoretical investigation of critical dynamics of system with parallel extended defects was performed in the one - loop approximation @xcite for the simple models with non - conserved order parameter ( model a ) and conserved order parameter ( model b ) .",
    "then the rg study of model a critical dynamics was extended to the two - loop order @xcite . but",
    "again , the convergence properties of the series obtained did not allow numerical evaluations .",
    "recently , the short - time critical dynamics of the model a was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to apply the state - of - the - art analysis of the divergent rg perturbation theory series to get numerical estimates of the exponents describing model a dynamics of @xmath0 magnets with extended impurities for a wide region of impurity dimension @xmath1 and for different values of @xmath15 . complementing existing estimates of the static exponents @xcite",
    ", our results will give comprehensive values for the critical exponents of systems with extended impurities and , in this way , will facilitate their experimental analysis .",
    "moreover , since both in experiments and in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations often the asymptotic region is not reached and effective exponents are observed @xcite , we will calculate these as well . by these estimates",
    "we will predict the possible scenarios of approaching the critical point .",
    "these are important to perform corresponding experimental checks , as it was shown recently by theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies of the @xmath0 disordered heisenberg magnets with point - like defects .",
    "the setup of the paper is as follows . in the next section we present the model ; in section [ iii ] the renormalization procedure is discussed . in section [ iv ]",
    "we apply the resummation techniques to analyze the renormalization group functions in two - loop approximation and present the quantitative estimates for the asymptotic dynamical critical exponents .",
    "section [ v ] gives description of possible scenarios for the effective critical behavior and section [ vi ] concludes our study .",
    "the starting point is the effective hamiltonian of the model of an @xmath15-vector magnet with @xmath1-dimensional defects , extending throughout the system along the coordinate directions symbolized as @xmath44 and randomly distributed in perpendicular directions @xmath45 @xcite : @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath47 is an @xmath15-component vector field : @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the bare mass and the coupling , @xmath51 is the bare anisotropy constant , @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote differentiation in the coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the impurity potential @xmath54 is introduced .",
    "the probability distribution of defects has zero mean and variance given by : @xmath55 here , @xmath56 denotes the averaging over the distribution of defects , ( -@xmath57 ) is a positive coupling constant , which is proportional to the concentration of impurities .",
    "the constant @xmath51 parameterizes the anisotropy , arising in the system due to the presence of extended defects .",
    "we consider critical dynamics of the model ( [ model ] ) for the case of a non - conserved order parameter .",
    "for this case the dynamics can be expressed in the langevin equation form @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the onsager kinetic coefficient and @xmath60 is the gaussian random - noise source with zero mean and correlation : @xmath61 the brackets @xmath62 mean an average with respect to the thermal noise .    within the field theory approach it is convenient to use the bausch - janssen - wagner formulation @xcite which is given by the lagrangian : @xmath63= \\int d^d x\\ , dt\\,\\sum_i \\tilde\\phi^i\\left[\\frac{\\partial\\phi^i}{\\partial t}+\\lambda_0\\frac{\\delta { \\cal h}}{\\delta \\phi^i}-\\lambda_0\\tilde\\phi^i\\right].\\ ] ] here , @xmath64 are components of an auxiliary response field introduced to average over the thermal noise .",

    "it is known that studying dynamical properties of disordered systems averaging over random impurities can be applied directly to dynamical weight function @xmath66 . as it is established in ref .",
    "@xcite , the configurational averaging can be performed avoiding replica trick @xcite .",
    "however it leads to the same perturbative expansions for the rg functions as those obtained with replica formalism .",
    "therefore both approaches giving equivalent results are possible for dynamics .",
    "however the above alternative does not exist when the static critical behavior is analyzed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "for @xmath147 it was found , that the relation @xmath148 holds for every @xmath1 and @xmath15 , which is connected to the fact , that the extended defects cut interacting paths of spins perpendicular to the extended - defect direction , so in the parallel direction the fluctuations are stronger .",
    "the data of tables [ tab1 ] , [ tab4 ] give numerical values of the dynamical critical exponents for the model a dynamics of the @xmath15-vector magnets with extended @xmath1-dimensional defects .",
    "together with possible scenarios of the effective critical behavior discussed in the section [ v ] it should facilitate experimental studies of the influence of extended defects on criticality .",
    "as we already noted , the point defects change the universality class at @xmath0 only for the ising magnets ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "values of the critical exponent @xmath149 of the pure and the diluted ( by point - like impurities ) ising model are given in tables [ tab2 ] , [ tab3 ] , respectively .",
    "comparing the data in these tables one sees an increase of the exponent for the diluted model with respect to the pure one .",
    "this corresponds to a stronger divergency of the relaxation time ( increase of the critical slowing - down effects ) .",
    "further , comparing tables [ tab3 ] and [ tab1 ] one sees that extended impurities make this effect more pronounced , leading to further increase of both exponents @xmath150 .",
    "however this increase ( of the order of 8 % if one compares @xmath149-exponents for point and line defects ) is not dramatic to make mc simulations impossible due to enhanced critical slowing down . on the other hand ,",
    "the same order of difference in critical exponents values holds also for the static exponents @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the predicted change in the critical behavior of three dimensional magnets with extended impurities is within current experimental accuracy",
    ". although it is more difficult to extract dynamical critical exponents from simulations to the same accuracy , it would be worthwhile to look for them ( i ) in the cases of different defect dimensionality and ( ii ) in the non - asymptotic regime .",
