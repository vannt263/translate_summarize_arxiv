    "in a quantum theory of gravity the coupling constant is dimensionful , @xmath1 , and within the standard perturbative treatment of radiative corrections one expects trouble in four dimensions , based on purely on dimensional grounds .",
    "the divergent one loop corrections are proportional to @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ultraviolet cutoff , which then leads to a bad high momentum behavior , with an effective running newton s constant @xmath4 a more general argument for perturbative non - renormalizability starts by considering the gravitational action with scalar curvature term @xmath5 , which involves two derivatives of the metric .",
    "then the graviton propagator in momentum space goes like @xmath6 , and the vertex functions like @xmath7 . in @xmath8 dimensions",

    "one therefore concludes that for @xmath13 the degree of divergence for einstein gravity increases rapidly with loop order @xmath11 , and that the theory can not be renormalized in naive perturbation theory . a consequence of the lack of perturbative renormalizability is the fact that new higher derivative counterterms arise to one - loop order [ 1 ] @xmath14 with even higher derivatives appearing at the next order .",
    "one concludes that the standard approach based on a perturbative expansion of the pure einstein theory in four dimensions is not convergent ; in fact it is badly divergent .",
    "a number of possible options have been proposed , the simplest of which is to just add the above higher derivative terms to the original action .",
    "the resulting extended theory is perturbatively renormalizabe to all orders , but suffers potentially from unitarity problems . but these can not be satisfactorily addressed in perturbation theory , as the theory is now asymptotically free in the higher derivative couplings and presumably exhibits a non - trivial vacuum .",
    "alternatively , the gravity divergences can be cancelled by adding new unobserved massless particles and invoking supersymmety ; in fact it has been claimed recently that @xmath15 supergravity might not be just renormalizable , but indeed finite to some relatively high loop order .",
    "the downside of this somewhat contrived approach is the artificial introduction of a plethora of unobserved massless particles of spin @xmath16 , added to the original action in order to cancel the gravitational ultraviolet divergences .",
    "finally , string theory solves the problem of ultraviolet divergences by postulating the existence of fundamental extended objects , thus in part bypassing the requirement of supersymmetry and providing a natural cutoff for gravity , related to a fundamental string scale [ 2 ] .",
    "nevertheless one important point that can not be overlooked is the fact that in other field theories , which to some extent share with gravity the same set of ultraviolet problems ( the non - linear sigma model is the most notable one , and the best studied case ) , the analogous result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g - pert ] ) is in fact known to be _",
    "incorrect_. it appears as an artifact of naive perturbation theory , which in four dimensions does not converge , and seems to lead therefore to fundamentally incorrect answers . the correct answer in these models",
    "is found instead either by expanding around the dimension in which the theory _ is _ perturbatively renormalizable , or by solving it exactly in the large @xmath17 limit and then computing @xmath18 corrections , or by solving it numerically on a lattice .",
    "the generic new feature in these models is the existence of a non - trivial fixed point of the renormalization group [ 3 - 7 ] , which is inaccessible by perturbation theory in four dimensions , and radically alters the ultraviolet behavior of the theory .",
    "non - linear @xmath19-model in three dimensions , whose field theoretic treatment based on a non - trivial fixed point of the renormalization group , either on the lattice or in the continuum , eventually provides detailed predictions for scaling behavior and anomalous dimensions in the vicinity of the fixed point [ 5,8 ] .",
    "these have recently been verified experimentally to high accuracy in a sophisticated space shuttle experiment [ 9 ] for critical superfuid helium , whose order parameter corresponds to @xmath20 in the non - linear @xmath19-model . ]",
    "the key question for gravity is therefore : are the ultraviolet problems just an artifact of a naive application of perturbation theory in four dimensions , as clearly happens in other perturbatively non - renormalizable theories that also contain dimensionful couplings in four dimensions ?    in the following",
    "i will limit my discussion to the approach based on traditional quantum field theory methods and the renormalization group , applied to the einstein action with a cosmological term , an avenue which in the end is intimately tied with the existence of a non - trivial ultraviolet fixed point in @xmath0 in four dimensions .",
    "the nature of such a fixed point was first discussed in detail by k. wilson for scalar and fermionic theories [ 3 ] , and the methods later applied to gravity in [ 6 ] , where they were referred to as asymptotic safety . as discussed above",
    ", it is fair to say that so far this is the only approach known to work in other not perturbatively renormalizable theories .",
    "if non - perturbative effects play an important role in quantum gravity , then one would expect the need for an improved formulation of the quantum theory , which does not rely exclusively on the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "after all , the fluctuating quantum metric field @xmath21 is dimensionless , and carries therefore no natural scale . for the somewhat simpler cases of a scalar field and non - abelian gauge theories",

    "therefore only the latter combination has physical meaning in pure gravity .",
    "in particular , one can always choose the scale @xmath37 , so as to adjust the volume term to have a unit coefficient .",
    "the implication of this last result is that pure gravity only contains one bare coupling @xmath38 , besides the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath3 needed to regulate the quantum theory .",
    "in two dimensions the gravitational coupling becomes dimensionless , @xmath40 , and the theory appears perturbatively renormalizable . in spite of the fact that the gravitational action reduces to a topological invariant , it is meaningful to attempt to construct , in analogy to what was suggested originally by wilson for scalar field theories , the theory perturbatively as a double series in @xmath41 and @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath39 expansion for pure gravity then proceeds as follows [ 6,11 ] .",

    "the physics of this result is contained in the fact that the gravitational @xmath53-function determines the scale dependence of newton s constant @xmath0 , and has the shape shown in fig",
