    "the future experiment atlas @xcite at the large hadron collider ( cern ) will include a combined calorimeter @xcite with in the central region the two separate units : the liquid - argon electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite and the iron - scintillating hadronic calorimeter @xcite .    for many tasks of calorimetry",
    "it is necessary to know a non - compensation of combined calorimeter compartments . as to the hadronic calorimeter",
    "there is the detailed information about the @xmath0 ratio presented in @xcite .",
    "but as to the electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite reliable information practically absent .",
    "the aim of the present work is to develop the method for the determination of the electromagnetic compartment non - compensation and compares results of this method with results of weighting method @xcite and monte carlo prediction @xcite for the same calorimeter .",
    "the new method of an energy reconstruction for combined calorimeter is also presented . for detailed understanding of performance of the future calorimetry",
    "the combined calorimeter setup has been made consisting of the liquid - argon electromagnetic calorimeter inside the cryostat and downstream the iron - scintillating hadronic calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the response , @xmath1 , of a calorimeter to a hadronic shower is the sum of the contributions from the electromagnetic , @xmath2 , and hadronic , @xmath3 , parts of the hadronic shower energy , @xmath4 , @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the energy independent coefficient of transformation electromagnetic ( hadronic ) part of a shower energy to response .",
    "therefor an incident energy is @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10 is a fraction of electromagnetic energy . in the case of a combined calorimeter",
    "the incident energy is deposited into an electromagnetic compartment , @xmath11 , into a hadronic compartment , @xmath12 , and into a dead material between the two calorimeters , @xmath13 . using relation ( [ ev16 ] ) the following expression",
    "has been obtained : @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is response of a electromagnetic ( hadronic ) calorimeter compartment , @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite are the energy calibration constant for electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter .",
    "( [ ev7 ] ) is the basic formula for the new , non - parametrical , method of a hadronic energy reconstruction for a combined calorimeter .",
    "this method does not require the determination of any parameters by a minimisation technique and uses known @xmath0 ratios and electron calibration constants . in the right side of the eq .",
    "( [ ev7 ] ) an energy is under a logarithmic function therefore for achievement of convergence with an accuracy of @xmath19 is sufficiently only the first approximation . the obtained reconstruction of the mean values of energies is within @xmath20 and this accuracy can be compared with results from ref .",
    "the fractional energy resolution is comparable with the benchmark method result @xcite .",
    "the method can be used for the fast energy reconstruction in the trigger .    from expression ( [ ev7 ] ) the value of the @xmath21 ratio can be obtained @xmath22 the @xmath23 ratio can be inferred from ( [ ev10 ] ) , where @xmath24 is the beam energy .",
    "for calculation of the @xmath12 the value @xmath25 @xcite was used and @xmath24 in the ( [ ev10 ] ) is the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath13 is taken similar to @xcite : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an energy released in a last depth of an electromagnetic calorimeter and @xmath29 is an energy released in a first depth of a hadronic calorimeter .",
    "the validity of this approximation has been tested by the experimental study @xcite and by the monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "the mean values of the @xmath21 distributions , derived by ( [ ev1 ] ) and extracting by fitting in the @xmath30 @xcite , are given in table [ tv1 ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fv3 ] ( black circles ) as a function of the energy .",
    "the fit of @xmath21 values by the expression ( [ ev10 ] ) , with two parameters , yields @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath33 is in the good agreement with well known @xmath34 @xcite . for fixed parameter",
    "@xmath33 the value of non - compensation is @xmath35 .",
    "the quoted errors are the statistical ones and obtained from the fit . the systematic error , which is a consequence of the uncertainties in the input constants used in the ( [ ev1 ] ) , is estimated to be @xmath36 .",

    "@xcite showed that the @xmath0 ratio for non - uranium calorimeters with high-@xmath49 absorber material is satisfactorily described by the formula : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant determined by the @xmath49 of the absorber ( for lead @xmath52 ) @xcite , @xmath53 and @xmath54 represent the calorimeter response to electromagnetic showers and to mev - type neutrons , respectively .",
    "these responses are normalised to the one for minimum ionising particles .",
    "the monte carlo calculated @xmath53 and @xmath54 values @xcite for the lead - liquid - argon electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite are @xmath55 and @xmath56 and leading to @xmath57 .",
    "the measured value of the @xmath23 ratio agrees with this prediction .",
    "the formula ( [ wig ] ) show that @xmath53 is very important for understanding compensation in lead - liquid - argon calorimeters .",
    "the non - compensation increase when the sampling frequency is also increased @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of the electromagnetic energy is deposited through very soft electrons ( @xmath58 mev ) produced by compton scattering or the photoelectric effect .",
    "the cross sections for these processes strongly depend on @xmath49 and practically all these photon conversions occur in the absorber material .",
    "the range of the electrons produced in these processes is very short , @xmath59 mm for 1 mev electron in lead .",
    "such electrons only contribute to the calorimeter signal if they are produced near the boundary between the lead and the active material .",
    "if the absorber material is made thinner this effective boundary layer becomes a larger fraction of the total absorber mass and the calorimeter response goes up .",
    "this effect was predicted by egs4 simulation @xcite .",
    "it explains that predictions for the gem @xcite accordion electromagnetic calorimeter ( 1 mm lead and 2 mm liquid - argon ) are the @xmath60 and the @xmath61 .",
    "the monte carlo calculations also predict that the electromagnetic response for liquid - argon calorimeters ( due to the larger @xmath49 value of argon ) is consistently large than for calorimeters with plastic - scintillator readout .",
    "the signal from neutron ( @xmath54 ) suppressed with factor @xmath62 and the @xmath63 elastic scattering products do not contribute to the signal of liquid - argon calorimeters .",
    "these detectors only observe the @xmath64 s produced by inelastic neutron scattering and from thermal neutron capture @xcite .    in the refs .",
    "@xcite the following definition of an @xmath65 ratio for first compartment of the combined calorimeter is adopted .",
    "the estimators for pion and electron energies , respectively , are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are responses of elecromagnetic and hadronic compartments of a combined calorimeter , @xmath68 ( energy independent within @xmath69 ) is the energy calibration constant for the electromagnetic calorimeter , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are weighting parameters for pions .",
    "these parameters was find using a minimisation procedure for a energy resolution ( @xmath72 ) at every beam energies . in the ref .",
    "@xcite an electron / pion ration defined as @xmath73 .",
    "this definition one can find from ( [ ev7 ] ) for an electromagnetic compartment , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the results of this weighting method for @xmath21 rations are given in table [ tv1 ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fv3 ] ( open circles are for @xcite and open squares are for @xcite ) . in the energy region",
    "@xmath76 gev the @xcite data are in a good agreement with @xcite data and in disagreement for energies @xmath77 gev .",
    "fit of the @xmath21 values by the expression ( [ ev10 ] ) , with two parameters , yields @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xcite data and @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xcite data .",
    "note , that problematical value of @xmath82 at 300 gev @xcite is excluded from the fit .",
    "one can see that parameters @xmath33 are more bigger that its well known value and the @xmath23 are bigger than our result . for fixed parameter",
    "@xmath83 the result of the fit are @xmath84 for @xcite data and @xmath85 for @xcite data . in the both cases we calculated errors of the @xmath0 taken into account the values of @xmath86 .",
    "the finding @xmath0 rations are in agreement with our result within error bars .",
    "therefore , one can see that the weighting method leads to distortion of the @xmath21 ratios .",
    "the method of extraction of the @xmath0 ratio for electromagnetic compartment of combined calorimeter is suggested and the non - compensation was determined .",
    "the results agree with the monte carlo prediction and results of the weighting method for electromagnetic compartment of combined calorimeter .",
    "the new easy method of a hadronic energy reconstruction for a combined calorimeter is also suggested .",
    "the proposed methods can be used for combined calorimeter , which is being designed to perform energy measurement in a next - generation high energy collider experiment like atlas at lhc .",
