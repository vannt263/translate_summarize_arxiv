    "neutrino oscillations have been studied by many experiments in disappearance mode @xcite . in 2010 the opera experiment , searching for @xmath0 oscillations in appearance mode by detecting @xmath1 leptons produced in @xmath2 charged current interactions , observed a first @xmath2 candidate @xcite .",
    "recently the super - kamiokande experiment reported the evidence of a @xmath2 appearance signal in atmospheric neutrino data @xcite , with a signal - to - noise ratio of about one tenth . in parallel , opera and t2k ,",
    "both operating with accelerator - based neutrino beams , have shown the first proof of flavour transitions in appearance mode with a high signal - to - noise ratio @xcite . while the t2k experiment has observed @xmath4 oscillations @xcite , the opera experiment , operating in low background conditions and with a signal - to - noise ratio of about ten , has reported the 3@xmath3 evidence of @xmath0 appearance @xcite using a subsample of the data collected in the 2008 - 2012 runs . in this paper",
    ", we describe an additional @xmath2 candidate event , with the @xmath1 decaying into a hadron , found in the analysis of an extended data set , including also the events of the 2012 run without any muon in the final state .",
    "we finally report the achieved significance in the observation of @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "in order to meet the experimental requirements of a large target mass and a micrometric spatial accuracy to detect short - lived @xmath1 lepton decays , a target made of lead plates interspaced with emulsion films acting as tracking devices is used .",
    "the opera detector @xcite is composed of two identical parts called super modules , each consisting of a target section followed by a spectrometer .",
    "the target has an average mass of about 1.2 kt and a modular structure with an average number of 141431 target units , called bricks .",
    "a brick consists of 57 emulsion films @xcite , interleaved with 1 mm thick lead plates .",
    "bricks are arranged in walls alternated with scintillator strip planes ( target tracker or tt ) .",
    "magnetic spectrometers , consisting of iron core magnets instrumented with resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) and drift tubes ( high - precision tracker or pt ) , are used for the measurement of the muon charge @xcite and momentum . in order to reduce the emulsion scanning load ,",
    "removable pairs of emulsion films called changeable sheets @xcite are used as interface trackers between the tt and the bricks .",
    "the opera detector was exposed to the cern neutrinos to gran sasso ( cngs ) beam @xcite from 2008 to 2012 .",
    "a sample of 19505 contained neutrino interactions corresponding to 17.97@xmath510@xmath6 protons on target ( pot ) have been registered by the detector .",
    "a three - dimensional track is tagged as a muon if the product of its length and the density along its path is larger than 660 g/@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "an event is classified as 1@xmath8 if either it contains at least one track tagged as a muon or the total number of fired tt or rpc planes is larger than 19 .",
    "the complementary sample is defined as 0@xmath8 .",
    "0@xmath8 events contain the signals of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 decay channels .",
    "1@xmath8 events contain the @xmath12 decay channel .",
    "most of signal events occur at low muon momentum thus a muon momentum cut at 15 gev / c was introduced to accelerate the finding of signal for @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "the data set used in the present analysis consists of the 0@xmath8 events and the 1@xmath8 events with a muon momentum smaller than 15 gev / c that were collected during the 5 years of run . with respect to our most recent study @xcite",
    ", it now includes the last missing sample , the 0@xmath8 events of the 2012 run . for runs 2008 - 2009",
    ", all events have been searched for in the two most probable bricks while so far only in the first most probable brick for runs 2010 - 2012 .",
    "the numbers of analysed events are summarised in table [ tb : analysed ] .",
    "the selection criteria of @xmath2 interactions and the evaluation of efficiencies and backgrounds are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the observation of three @xmath2 candidate events has been reported in previous articles @xcite .",
    "a new @xmath2 candidate event was found in this new sample and is reported here .",
    ".number of events used in this analysis . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     , for @xmath13 events passing all the cuts in all decay channels .",
    "red lines show the measured values for the four @xmath2 candidate events :  1 \" and  4 \" in the @xmath9 decay channel ,  2 \" in @xmath10 and  3 \" in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the significance of the observation of the four @xmath2 candidate events is estimated by considering the confidence for excluding the null hypothesis .",
    "individual @xmath14-values of the @xmath1 decay channels are combined independently according to the fisher s rule into an estimator @xmath15 @xcite . in order to take into account the systematic uncertainties of the backgrounds , 100 sets of randomised backgrounds",
    "are generated .",
    "a mean @xmath14-value of 1.24 @xmath5 10@xmath16 is obtained by monte carlo calculation of the tail probability corresponding to the observed value of @xmath17 .",
    "the absence of signal can be excluded with a significance of 4.2@xmath3 .    alternatively a hypothesis test employing a likelihood - based approach @xcite was performed .",
    "the likelihood function is @xmath18 .",
    "the index @xmath19 runs over decay channels , the parameter @xmath8 determines the strength of the signal process ( @xmath8 = 0 corresponds to the background - only hypothesis ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the numbers of expected signal and background events , @xmath22 the number of observed events .",
    "the systematic uncertainties of the backgrounds were taken into account in a similar way as above .",
    "a @xmath14-value of 1.03 @xmath5 10@xmath16 corresponding to a significance of 4.2@xmath3 for the exclusion of the null hypothesis is obtained .",
    "given the 4 observed events and the expected background of ( 0.233 @xmath23 0.041 ) events , the confidence interval of @xmath24 is estimated with the feldman - cousins method @xcite , assuming maximal mixing .",
    "the systematic uncertainties of signal and background are taken into account to marginalise the likelihood function used for the ordering principle .",
    "the 90% confidence interval of @xmath24 is [ 1.8 , 5.0 ] @xmath5 10@xmath25 ev@xmath26 .",
    "an alternative analysis employing a bayesian approach @xcite with a flat prior on @xmath24 was performed .",
    "the credible interval of @xmath24 is [ 1.9 , 5.0 ] @xmath5 10@xmath25 ev@xmath26 .",
    "more precise measurements by other experiments @xcite are within these intervals .",
    "a new @xmath2 candidate event , with the @xmath1 decaying into a hadron , found after adding an extended data sample is reported . given the analysed sample , @xmath0 oscillations are established at the 4.2@xmath3 level .",
    "the search for events , not found in the most probable bricks in the 2010 - 2012 runs , is being extended to the second most probable bricks for future results .",
