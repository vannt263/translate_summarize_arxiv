    "it is well known that the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields in the presence of boundaries give rise to casimir force , which was shown to be attractive when the boundary consists of a pair of perfectly conducting parallel plates @xcite .",
    "since the seminal work of casimir , many studies have been done on casimir effect where different quantum fields and geometric configurations have been considered .",
    "nevertheless , after 60 years of its discovery , casimir effect is still under active research . by definition ,",
    "the calculation of casimir energy involves an infinite sum that needs to be regularized",
    ". however , there is still no consensus on the regularization procedures , which often lead to inconsistent results . even for geometric configuration as simple as a rectangular cavity , despite zeta regularization technique or dimensional regularization method can give finite results for the casimir force acting on a wall @xcite , some authors considered these regularization methods which renormalize all surface divergence terms to zero as being not physical @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , geyer , klimchitskaya and mostepanenko @xcite have recently developed a subtraction scheme to obtain a physically consistent casimir force acting on a wall of a perfectly conducting rectangular cavity from the point of view of thermodynamics .",
    "another approach to this problem was considered by fulling et al @xcite . in 2004 , cavalcanti @xcite proposed an alternative to this problem by adding a piston in the rectangular cavity .",
    "he showed that for a 2-dimensional rectangular piston , the casimir force acting on the piston due to fluctuations of a scalar field with dirichlet boundary conditions is finite without renormalization and can be computed exactly .",
    "since then , casimir piston has attracted considerable interest @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that at any dimension and temperature , for either scalar field or electromagnetic field , if the boundary conditions assumed on all the walls are the same and is an ideal condition , then the casimir force is always an attractive force which tends to pull the piston to the nearer wall . as the length scale shrinks to the nano range , this attractive casimir force would create undesirable effects on microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical devices known as stiction @xcite , which would limit the functionality of the devices . as a result",
    ", there is an impelling need to search for scenarios that would lead to repulsive casimir force . in the case of infinite parallel plates , boyer @xcite",
    "has shown that the casimir force acting on the plates is repulsive if one of the plates is perfectly conducting and the other is infinitely permeable .",
    "the thermal correction of the casimir force for this configuration was considered in @xcite and it was proved that the casimir force remains repulsive at any finite temperature .",
    "another generalization of boyer s work was considered in @xcite , where it was proved that if the plates are made of dielectric materials with nontrivial magnetic permeability , then for a large range of parameters , the casimir force is repulsive .",
    "similar results were obtained in @xcite .",
    "for the piston geometry , barton @xcite showed that the casimir force acting on a piston made of weakly dielectric materials can become repulsive when the plate separation is sufficiently large . in this paper , we generalize the original setup of boyer @xcite to piston moving freely inside a closed cylinder , where the piston is perfectly conducting and the walls of the cylinder are infinitely permeable ( see fig .",
    "this setup has been suggested by fulling et al @xcite but they only considered the zero temperature casimir force for rectangular piston and exact explicit formulas of the casimir force were not given . in the present article , we allow the piston to have arbitrary cross section and it is shown that the casimir force is free of surface divergence even without renormalization .",
    "we prove rigourously that at any temperature , the casimir force is always repulsive tending to restore the piston to its equilibrium position , and the magnitude of the casimir force decreases as the piston moves towards the equilibrium position . in the high temperature regime , we show that the casimir forces due to the blackbody radiation from the two regions separated by the piston cancel each other , and the leading order of the casimir force is linear in temperature .",
    "this implies the existence of classical limit for the casimir force . due to the duality between electric field and magnetic field in",
    "( 3 + 1 ) dimension , all the results in this paper also hold for an infinitely permeable piston moving freely in a closed perfectly conducting cylinder .",
    "= .6    in this paper , we use the units where @xmath0 in sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] . in sections",
    "[ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] , we use si units .",
    "in this section , we first discuss the eigenfrequencies of the electromagnetic field for each region divided by the piston .",
    "we then give the expressions for the casimir energy which was computed by exponential cut - off method in appendix [ app ] .",
    "for a cylinder @xmath1\\times \\omega$ ] , where the boundary surfaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 are infinitely permeable but the boundary surface @xmath4 is perfectly conducting , the eigenfrequencies for the electromagnetic field can be written as follows .",
    "the boundary conditions are equivalent to the conditions @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the surfaces @xmath2 and @xmath1\\times { \\partial}\\omega$ ] , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 on the surface @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the unit normal vector to the surface , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electric field and magnetic field respectively .",
    "the fields can be expressed in terms of the vector potential @xmath12 by @xmath13 and @xmath14 . imposing the transversality condition @xmath15 , maxwell s equations are equivalent to @xmath16 .",
    "one can then check that for the te modes ( i.e. modes with @xmath17 ) , a set of independent solutions for @xmath12 is given by @xmath18 , @xmath19here @xmath20 . for @xmath21 ,",

    "therefore we define a cut - off dependent casimir energy @xmath41 by @xmath45according to the previous subsection , we can decompose this into the sum over te modes @xmath46 and the sum over tm modes @xmath47 . in the appendix",
    ", we use zeta function and heat kernel techniques to compute the casimir energies @xmath46 and @xmath47 due to te modes and tm modes respectively .",

    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 since we exclude the zero mode from the neumann spectrum .",
    "as shown by or , the @xmath57 divergent terms of the casimir energy depend linearly on @xmath58 .",
    "this implies that @xmath57 divergent term of the casimir energy of the piston system does not depend on the piston position @xmath82 .",
    "therefore these divergences do not contribute to the casimir force acting on the piston , which implies that the casimir force acting on the piston is finite even without renormalization .      from",
    ", we find that the casimir force is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the limit of the casimir force when @xmath85 given by @xmath86since this is obviously a positive decreasing function of @xmath82 , shows that the casimir force acting on the piston has positive sign when @xmath87 and has negative sign when @xmath88 . in other words , the casimir force always tends to restore the piston to the equilibrium position @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the casimir force decreases as the piston moves towards its equilibrium position .",
    "note that is an exact expression for the casimir force at any finite temperature . with the knowledge of the eigenvalues of laplace operator with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on the surface @xmath24 ,",
    "one can compute the casimir force by this formula to any degree of accuracy . in particular , for a rectangular piston with cross section @xmath90\\times[0 , l_3]$ ] , we have @xmath91    eq .",
    "shows that when @xmath92 , the casimir force is dominated by a term linear in @xmath93 corresponding to those terms with @xmath94 . the remaining terms decay exponentially as @xmath92 .",
    "notice that to restore the constants @xmath95 and @xmath96 into the expression for the casimir force , we need to replace @xmath93 by @xmath97 everywhere and multiply the overall expression by @xmath98 .",
    "therefore the high temperature expansion of the casimir force is the same as the small-@xmath99 expansion of the casimir force .",
    "a term with order @xmath100 will be accompanied with the term @xmath101 .",
    "the leading term of the casimir force is linear in @xmath93 implies that this leading term is independent of @xmath99 , and the remaining terms go to zero if we formally let @xmath99 goes to @xmath59 . as a result , we find that the casimir force has a classical limit ( or high temperature limit ) given by @xmath102 for its small @xmath82-behavior , we derive in appendix [ app ] that @xmath103this shows that at high temperature , when the plate separation @xmath82 is small , the casimir force is dominated by the term @xmath104interestingly , this term does not depend on the geometry of the cross section , but depends only on the area of the cross section . moreover , it is equal to @xmath105 times the classical term of the casimir force acting on a pair of perfectly conducting parallel plates .",
    "in fact , one can verify that if @xmath106 is the casimir force when both the piston and the surrounding walls are perfectly conducting or infinitely permeable , then the casimir force @xmath107 when the piston is perfectly conducting but the surrounding walls are infinitely permeable is related to @xmath106 by @xmath108 in particular , when the piston has rectangular cross section , we derive from the results in @xcite the following alternative explicit formula for the classical term of the casimir force : @xmath109    we would like to remark that comparing and in appendix [ app ] , we can deduce that in the high temperature regime , the leading behavior of the casimir force contribution from region i alone is given by ( see appendix [ app ] ) : @xmath110this implies that as expected , the leading term of the casimir force from region i alone is the blackbody radiation term @xmath111however , since the blackbody radiation from region ii would contribute a force of the same magnitude but opposite direction , the effect of the blackbody radiation on the piston can not be observed .",
    "in fact , there is also a term proportional to @xmath112 of magnitude @xmath113 which has been canceled out in the final casimir force acting on the piston .      in the zero temperature limit",
    ", the casimir force can be obtained from .",
    "when @xmath85 , it is given by @xmath114using the same method as we derive , one finds that as @xmath115 , the leading behavior of the zero temperature casimir force acting on the piston is given by @xmath116 in particular , for small plate separation , the leading term of the casimir force is @xmath117 which is @xmath118 times the casimir force acting on a pair of perfectly conducting infinite parallel plates , in consistent with the result of boyer @xcite for parallel plates . notice that this leasing term only depends on the area but not the geometry of @xmath24",
    ".    in the case of rectangular piston",
    ", we have the following explicit formula for the zero temperature casimir force in the @xmath85 limit : @xmath119 in particular , @xmath120 in agreement with the general result .",
