    "we have been working on the nucleon for close to 100 years , and all we want to know is what the nucleon looks like .",
    "how do its static properties , mass , charge , magnetic moment , spin , and structure arise , and how it reacts when it is tickled by an external probe ?",
    "not too much to ask ! !",
    "we are told that there is a super - duper new way of tickling the nucleon , * deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs)/deeply virtual meson production ( dvmp ) * , which leads to the generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) , and they can give all the information that we used to try to get by measuring form factors and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . maybe so !",
    "indeed , nearly all the labs in the business , jlab , h1 , zeus , hermes , brookhaven , cern(compass ) , now have very active programs for measuring gpd s ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "domain accessible to gpd measurements at different laboratories.,title=\"fig:\",width=220 ]   domain accessible to gpd measurements at different laboratories.,title=\"fig:\",width=220 ]    unfortunately , life is not so easy .",
    "the observables are all integrals over @xmath0(bjorken ) and deconvolution is required to get to the true gpd s , @xmath1 , which are functions of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . and",
    "that is neither easy nor unique .",
    "so , like the gdp , which is supposed to contain all the information about a country s economy , the whole story is not in the gpd measurements , either . for the present , therefore , we go back to the more directly interpretable form factor and dis measurements .      there has been recent progress in form factor measurements , both for spacelike and timelike momentum transfers .    *",
    "the challenge of @xmath4(proton ) for spacelike momentum transfers *    the recent jlab polarization measurements for spacelike momentum transfers up to @xmath5  gev@xmath6 show clearly that the @xmath7 of the proton monotonically falls with increasing @xmath8 , or equivalently , @xmath9 monotonically rises , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the naive pqcd expectation was that both @xmath7 and @xmath9 were constant for large @xmath8 .",
    "what happened ?",
    "many * * post**dictions have been made .",
    "suffice it to say that there are no clear - cut consensus explanations .",

    "if the trend continues , with the 12 gev upgrade @xmath12 will be found to be negative .",
    "what does * that * mean ?",

    ", qcd makes two predictions about the relationship between form factors at spacelike and timelike momentum transfers .",
    "the first , based on quark counting rules , is that for both , @xmath14 should be constant except for the variation of @xmath15 .",
    "the second is that in this regime , the two should be equal ( actually , this follows from cauchy s theorem because form factors are analytic functions ) .",
    "the general expectation was that @xmath16  gev@xmath6 should be large enough for both these predictions to be true .",
    "fermilab @xmath17 measurements for @xmath18  gev@xmath6 showed that while the @xmath19 and @xmath15 variations were essentially confirmed , the timelike form factors were twice as large as the corresponding spacelike form factors ( see  fig .  3 ) . since then , the experimental measurements of fermilab have been confirmed and extended by the reverse reaction measurements of @xmath20 by bes , cleo , and babar .",
    "so , the factor two is more than confirmed , and we have to understand how it arises .",
    "let me add a very important point here . for timelike form factors ,",
    "lattice is totally impotant .",
    "the practitioners admit that they are stuck in euclidean time and can not handle timelike form factors because they live in minkowski time .",
    "so , there !    this poses a challenge . why half  agreement and half  disagreement with pqcd ?",
    "one way out that has been suggested is that the proton does not look like a mercedes star , with three symmetrically placed quarks , but more like a t , with a diquark - quark configuration , and the diquark model does succeed in explaining the factor two discrepancy .",
    "many people do not buy the diquark model , and so seek refuge in the possibility that @xmath21  gev@xmath6 is not large enough for pqcd to be valid .",
    "this , of course , throws the challenge to the experimentalists : measure timelike form factors at larger @xmath8 .",
    "easier said than done ! !",
    "recall that @xmath22 varies as @xmath19 , and the cross section varies as @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "so , in going from 15  gev@xmath6 to 25  gev@xmath6 the cross section would fall a factor 20 from @xmath25  pb to * @xmath26  fb*. that is a difficult measurement . in principle , bes iii and panda could tackle it , but it will be very hard .     versus @xmath27 . also shown are the spacelike form factors as measured at slac .",
    "the dotted curves illustrate the @xmath15 variation predicted by pqcd.,width=336 ]    what about @xmath28 for timelike momentum transfers ? in principle , this could be done because the angular dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath29 is different .",
    "in fact , babar has tried to do this in their measurement of @xmath30 production in isr  mediated annihilation of @xmath31 .",
    "the errors are large ( and there is the familiar rosenbluth ansatz ) , but essentially @xmath32 is found to be constant @xmath33 in the entire region @xmath34",
    "recall that by @xmath35  gev@xmath6 the spacelike @xmath36 has fallen down to @xmath37 , and it extrapolates to zero by @xmath38  gev@xmath6 .",

    "the challenge of strange quark form factors *    for a long time there has been the nagging question about the role of the strange quarks in the nucleon .",
    "several experiments ( sample at bates(mit ) , pva4 at mainz , and g@xmath39 and happex at jlab ) have addressed this question by making the very demanding measurements of parity violating electron scattering .",
    "so far the data have been limited to @xmath40  gev@xmath6 .    a global analysis of the world data for @xmath41  gev@xmath6 leads to the conclusion that for @xmath42  gev@xmath6 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , i.e. , both are consistent with zero .",
    "the same analysis reaches essentially the same conclusion for the sixteen individual @xmath8 data points from 0.120.48  gev@xmath6 ( see  fig .  4 ) .",
    "the experimental challenge is to see if this conclusion holds for larger @xmath8 at which both g@xmath39 and happex plan to take data in the near future .    before i leave form factors ,",
    "let me add that there has been very encouraging progress recently in measuring form factors of the neutron .",
    "excellent jlab measurements of @xmath45 extend up to @xmath46  gev@xmath6 and for @xmath47 up to @xmath48  gev@xmath6 , and there are plans to go to larger @xmath8 .",
    "we all know what this is about .",
    "the quark spins just do nt add up to the spin  1/2 of the proton .",
    "so what accounts for the rest ?",
    "proton spin@xmath49 ,    where @xmath50,@xmath51    the latest results are    @xmath52  ( compass ) , @xmath53  ( hermes )    that leaves a large part for @xmath54 to account for .",
    "attempts have been made to measure @xmath55 via dis , polarized semi - inclusive dis , polarized @xmath56 collisions , and all results are consistent with @xmath57 .",
    "the sign of @xmath55 is so far undetermined .",
    "if @xmath55 is positive , @xmath58 is small .",
    "if @xmath55 is negative , one will need large @xmath58 from quarks and gluons .",
    "so the spin crisis remains unresolved after 20 years of experiments .",
    "both quark model and lattice calculations predict scores of @xmath59 and @xmath60 resonances , and most of them remain missing  ( see  fig .  5 ) .",
    "the claimed @xmath59 and @xmath60 resonances remain stuck in the pdg with their poor star ratings since before 1996 .",
    "thus , for example , of the 20 reported resonances with @xmath61  mev , 15 remain stuck with 1 and 2 stars , i.e. , their existence is doubtful .",
    "the old data was mostly produced with pion beams , and there are no new pion beams around , to boot , pions can not be polarized ! !",
    "the only hope is to search for the resonances in photo and electro  production , and decays into final states with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "however , capstick and roberts have warned that these amplitudes tend to be `` quite small '' and the going is going to be tough .",
    "nevertheless , valiant groups at mami , elsa , and jlab are trying .",
    "on the analysis side , new and more comprehensive general purpose tools of pwa analysis are being developed .",
    "it is time that these efforts had some good luck !    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in principle , the bottomonium system can lead to clearer insight into the onium spectroscopy , both because @xmath65 is smaller ( @xmath66 ) than for charmonium ( @xmath67 ) , and also because relativistic effects are smaller .",
    "however , @xmath68 cross sections are smaller , the states are denser , and no @xmath30 production has so far been available . for the upsilon ( @xmath69 ) states ,",
    "all we known is their masses , total widths , and branching fractions for leptonic , radiative , and @xmath70 decays",
    ". a scarce @xmath71 transition has been observed , but huge gaps remain . by far",
    "the greatest gap is once again about the lack of any knowledge of singlet states .",
    "even the ground state of bottomonium ( @xmath72 ) has never been identified , and neither has @xmath73 .",
    "since nobody is presently planning @xmath31 or @xmath30 annihilations in new searches for @xmath74 , the only possible source is cleo , which has the largest samples of @xmath75 data from its earlier runs . indeed",
    ", serious efforts are being presently made at cleo to identify @xmath74 in the radiative decay of @xmath76 .",
    "this then is a great challenge  find @xmath74 and @xmath77 .",
    "of course , i have long had a dream of doing @xmath68 spectroscopy in @xmath30 annihilation .",
    "unfortunately , neither a fixed target @xmath30 facility ( needs about 50  gev @xmath78 beams ) , nor a @xmath30 collider ( with @xmath79  gev beams ) appears to be on the horizon .",
    "so , this dream is not likely to be fulfilled anytime soon .    in the meantime",
    ", one long - cherished dream may come to fruition soon if cleo is successful in identifying @xmath74 .",
    "it has been conjectured for a long time that meson properties , notably their masses , widths , and elementary cross sections , should be modified in the nuclear medium .",
    "it has been predicted that the masses may change by tens of mev , and widths may be broadened by large amounts .",
    "also , cross sections for meson+a collisions should be quite different than meson+@xmath80 collisions ( color transparency ) .",
    "we are now beginning to get some answers , and as is always true , more questions .",
    "it is claimed that color transparency has been experimentally observed at high energies , with some unexplained observations at lower energies",
    ". the interesting problem of @xmath81 attenuation in heavy ion collisions , so important for the qgp question , remains provocatively open , because @xmath82 in nuclear medium remains unmeasured .    about mesons masses",
    "there are experimental controversies , for example , there are reports of a large shift in vector meson masses by kek , and there are reports of almost no shift by jlab .",
    "the situation at the moment is fluid , and it calls for more measurements with high precision and high mass resolution .    to summarize my own talk ,",
    "let me say that many , many extremely interesting questions in hadron spectroscopy remain unanswered at present . however , there is every hope that the upcoming facilities , panda at gsi , jparc at kek , and the 12  gev upgrade at jlab , will rise to meet the challenges posed by these questions and",
    "the theorists will find them deserving of serious attention even in this era of the higgs and beyond the standard model ! !",
    "since this is the last talk of the conference , let me take the opportunity , on behalf of all of us , to thank the organizers for their warm welcome , a very pleasant and successful conference , and also for the beautiful frascati weather !"
