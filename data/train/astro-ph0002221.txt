    "1998b ) have revealed light variations of several per cent ( up to 0.1 mag ) on time - scales ( typically ) of days .",
    "wr stars are generally believed to be evolved population i stars , descendants of of - type stars ( maeder 1996 ) .",
    "they exhibit strong , dense winds ( mass loss rates of @xmath10 to @xmath11 m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 ) which , in most cases , hide the stellar surface .",
    "the wind - flow is dependant on time .",
    "moffat et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1994 ) and robert ( 1994 ) discovered the existence of small , outward moving wind condensations , which they called propagating blobs .",
    "unlike most o - type stars , the continuum light of many wr stars originates from a layer in the dense wind ( @xmath14 ) , a `` pseudo - photosphere '' ( van genderen et al .",
    "1987 ) , which could be inhomogeneous because of dynamical wind instabilities .",
    "the brightness variations of some wr stars proved to be periodic and are possibly due to binary or rotation effects .",
    "core ( photospheric ) eclipses as well as atmospheric eclipses have been observed .",
    "the latter are characterized by only one v - shaped minimum on the light curve , which is caused by the atmospheric eclipse of an o - type star by the wr star s extended wind ( lamontagne et al .",
    "random light variations are common in wr stars and they are often superimposed on the regular ( binary ) variations , increasing the `` noise '' and sometimes even totally disturbing the underlying regular light variations .",
    "marchenko et al . ( 1998b ) suggested that random light variations ( light scatter ) may be caused by short - lived , core - induced , multimode fluctuations , propagating in the wind .",
    "other causes of variability , such as radial pulsations ( maeder 1985 ) non - radial pulsations ( vreux 1985 , antokhin et al .",
    "1995 , rauw et al . 1996 ) and axial rotation ( matthews & moffat 1994 ) have been proposed for wr stars .",
    "occasional `` eclipses '' caused by dust formation in late - type wc stars have been studied by veen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "wr137 is a well known dust maker ( williams 1997 ; marchenko et al .",
    "however little is known about long - term light variations for that star and its binary status is still uncertain .",
    "wr140 is another repeating dust maker ( williams 1997 ) .",
    "the orbit is well determined . because of its high eccentricity ( @xmath15 ) the strongest wind interaction occurs at periastron passage . during the last periastron passage in 1993 , wr140 received much attention and",
    "has been studied at different wavelengths from x - ray to radio . however",
    ", only a few photometric studies in the optical were carried out so far and the long - term behaviour of that star is not known . both stars wr137 and",
    "wr140 are included in the infrared study by williams et al .",
    "( 1987a ) and reported to have dust shells .",
    "wr148 is a good candidate for a wr + c ( wr plus compact companion ) binary .",
    "there is some controversy about the light variations concerning the period and the shape of the light curve .",
    "marchenko et al .",
    "( 1998a ) were not able to detect the 4.31 d binary period in the hipparcos photometry data , otherwise well known from ground - based observations ( marchenko et al .",
    "the very `` noisy '' light curve and unusually broad minimum need further investigation .",
    "wr153 is a quadruple system ( massey 1981 ) , containing a wn + o and an o + o system , or two wn + o pairs ( panov & seggewiss 1990 ) . during the past years",
    ", several photometric studies have been carried out . yet the light variability of the two pairs could not always be unambiguously separated ( lamontagne et al .",
    "our aim is to try to solve some of these controversial questions .",
    "in 1991 we started a long - term photometric study of the four wr stars at the national astronomical observatory rozhen , bulgaria , using the 60 cm telescope and the ubv single channel , photon counting photometer .",
    "the photometric equipment has been used for many years and proved to be very stable ( cf .",
    "panov et al .",
    "1982 ) .",
    "table  1 contains the comparison and the check stars used .",
    "generally , a 20diaphragm and an integration of 10s were used .",
    "each measurement consists of four consecutive integration cycles .",
    "an observing cycle was arranged in the following way : sky - comp - wr - comp - sky and was repeated 3 to 5 times , depending on the quality of the night .",
    "a separate measurement of the comparison star against the check star in the same way was obtained before or after the wr star observation .",
    "thus a nightly mean was calculated from the 3 to 5 individual measurements .",
    "the standard error of the nightly mean is 0.003 - 0.005 mag in most cases .",
    "reduction of the data was made taking into account dead - time effects , atmospheric extinction , and transformation into the standard @xmath0 system . in the following tables we present the magnitudes in the standard system",
    "; for wr137 , wr140 , and wr148 the data are magnitude differences in the sense : comparison star minus wr star .",
    "the contribution @xmath2 and @xmath3 of emission lines to the respective colours are taken from pyper ( 1966 ) and included in table  1 ( last two columns ) .",
    "no corrections have been applied for emission lines in our data .",
    "however , it does seem possible to distinguish the continuum light from the emission line variations by comparing the light in the @xmath0 passbands .",
    "many wr stars show subtle short and long term variations as can be seen in the case of wr148 ( sec .",
    "therefore it is preferable to use the same photometric equipment for long term studies .",
    "this reduces possible systematic effects caused by slightly different passbands or response curves .",

    "earlier spectroscopic studies failed to reveal the binary motion .",
    "however , a re - analysis of earlier published radial velocities and using the period in the ir ( 7.94 yr ) led to a successful determination of the orbit ( williams et al .",
    "it was found that the grain formation coincides with the periastron passage ( pp ) in the system ( actually occurring before pp ) .",
    "this discovery was later confirmed by moffat et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and now presents the basic model for studies of wr140 .",
    "williams et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and van der hucht et al .",
    "( 1991 ) reported on variability of wr140 at x - ray , uv , ir and radio - wavelengths .",
    "our photometry of wr140 is presented in table 3 and the light curves are shown in fig .",
    "3 . from fig .",
    "3 , there is clear evidence for a dip in the light in 1993 , between orbital phases @xmath200.9 and 1.1 .",
    "the dip is seen in all passbands and should therefore be due to continuum light attenuation .",
    "the amplitude of the `` eclipse '' in the @xmath1 passband is 0.03 mag .",
    "two remarkable features are to be mentioned .",
    "first , the very broad shape of the light minimum , assuming a smooth trend between yearly data .",
    "after 1993 , the light gradually increased to reach the `` pre - eclipse '' level in 1997 , or even 1998 .",
    "considering the `` eclipse '' to be caused by an obscuration of the star(s ) by the wind , the light curves strongly suggest that a dust envelope was built up around the wr star by the wind - wind interaction at the pp , which was gradually dispersed in the following years .",
    "possibly it is the same dust observed in the ir when still heated .",
    "second , it is apparent ( fig .",
    "3 ) that the amplitude of the eclipse increases towards shorter wavelengths . in the lower panel of fig .  3 ,",
    "the variation of the colour @xmath29 is shown , which is in the sense : wr140 colour gets redder when its light is attenuated .",
    "this conclusion is easily obtained when considering the magnitudes of the comparison star hd 193888 , which are : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the amplitude of the colour variation in @xmath34 of wr140 is 0.04 mag ( again fig .  3 ) .",
    "as is well known , the main source of opacity , ( non - relativistic ) electron scattering , has no effect on colours .",
    "thus , in this case electron scattering alone is not sufficient , and an additional opacity source should be introduced , possibly rayleigh ( or mie ) scattering by small carbon dust particles .",
    "occasional `` eclipses '' have been observed in the carbon - rich late - type wc stars wr103 , wr113 , and wr121 ( for a history of `` eclipses '' see veen et al .",
    "1998 ) . in these cases",
    "the `` eclipses '' were caused by occasional formation of dust in the line - of - sight .",
    "although dust formation in the winds of late - type wc stars is now well established , the problem with grain condensation in the very hostile environments where the grains are believed to form remains unsolved .",
    "clearly , a trigger is needed to start the grain formation . in the case of wr140",
    ", this could be the shock compression in the colliding winds at pp .",
    "we assume that the fading of wr140 shortly after pp is due to dust condensation in the wind of the wc star .",
    "after the condensation ceases the star brightens again because the dust is blown away and gradually dispersed .",
    "the `` eclipses '' studied by veen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have typical amplitudes of several tenths of a magnitude and last from several days up to a month .",
    "in contrast , the amplitude of the light dip in wr140 is much smaller and the recovery of brightness lasts several years .",
    "this implies continuing supply ( expanding from the pp production + new ? ) of dust , even 2  3 years after pp .",
    "if there is new dust , this would be really surprising , since the trigger seems no longer to be effective .",
    "following the procedure of veen et al .",
    "( 1998 , using their equations ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) ) and taking the terminal velocity @xmath35 from eenens & williams ( 1994 ) , we obtain for the distance @xmath36 of the dust formation region from the wc star in wr140 : @xmath37 .",
    "this is only a rough estimate , but it is much larger than the respective distances for all `` eclipses '' studied by veen and co - workers .",
    "it is also much larger than the radius of the shell of wr140 obtained by williams et al .",
    "( 1987a ) which is @xmath38 .",
    "taking for the carbon particle density @xmath39 we get for the dust mass production rate ( over unit area ) the value @xmath40 .",
    "these results should be taken with caution because of the small amplitude of the `` eclipse '' in wr140 and of possible deviations from the model used ( e.g. continued supply of dust after pp ) .",
    "wr140 was observed photometrically during pp in 1977 by fernie ( 1978 ) but no changes of brightness were found .",
    "this is likely due to his low precision data .    like wr137",
    ", the observations of wr140 also show small - amplitude , day - to - day random light variations ( amplitudes up to 0.02 mag ) , in addition to the eclipse variation .",
    "4 shows the correlations of the random light variations in @xmath0 , indicating that they are likely due to continuum rather than emission line variations ( similar to wr 137 , fig .",
    "2 ) . dynamical wind instabilities could be the origin , as in wr137 .",
    "moffat & shara ( 1986 ) suggested a 6.25 d period for the light variations they observed in wr140 , which , however , does not fit our data .",
    "our observations during 1991 - 1998 cover 90% of the orbit .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the forthcoming pp in 2001 will repeat the light curve so far observed .",

    "according to marchenko et al . , the rather weak x - ray source observed in wr148 ( pollock et al .",
    "1995 ) may be explained by the hot x - ray cavity being locally embedded in the wr envelope .",

    "the 1994 light curves , however , show a remarkable change in their shape and mean light level .",
    "random light variations , already noted in other works , could well contribute to the disturbance of the light curve shape , but it is unlikely that they would change the mean light .",
    "furthermore , long - term changes in mean light appear to be correlated in @xmath22 , @xmath21 , and @xmath1 ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "therefore , they too should be due to changes in continuum light .",
    "there is a strong evidence for a long - term variation of the mean light .",
    "although the time - base is too short , there are some indications that the long - term variation is periodic , possibly with a cycle of about 4 years .",
    "marchenko et al . ( 1998b ) point to a possible `` overall brightening '' of wr148 in 1994 and 1995 .",
    "as shown in fig.5 , it is obvious that in 1993 the mean light was even some 0.05 mag higher , as in 1994 .",
    "this long - term variation completely masks the short - term binary variations if the whole data set is depicted in one plot .",
    "therefore we plotted the data separately for each year in fig .",
    "5 .    taking into account the model of marchenko et al.(1996 ) , the long - term light variations in wr148 could be due to variations of the size of the hot x - ray cavity .",
    "further conclusions at that time seem premature . a comment should be given on the observation at jd 2449585.4 , phase = 0.57 ( the companion @xmath20 in front ) , which strongly deviates from the regular light curve of 1994 .",
    "as we can exclude observational errors as a reason for this measurement , it has to have some astrophysical origin .",

    "6a and fig .  6b , with the 6.6884 d and 3.4696 d periods , respectively .",
    "from fig .  6 ,",
    "our data are consistent with the ephemeris of massey ( 1981 ) and annuk ( 1994 ) , respectively .",
    "since the true shape of both light curves is unknown , no allowance is made for the 3.47 d period in fig .",
    "6a , where it is superimposed on the 6.69 d light variations . in fig .  6b , the data points around the 6.69 d period minimum ( at phases from 0.96 to 0.13 in fig .",
    "6a ) have been removed .",
    "the light curve with the 6.69 d period ( pair a ) is probably due to an atmospheric eclipse ( only one , v - shaped light minimum ! ) . in pair b ,",
    "two light minima are seen due to a core eclipse in that pair .",
    "independent evidence can be obtained from the hipparcos photometry data .",
    "we made a period search , using 122 data - points from hipparcos .",
    "the analysis was performed with the peribm procedure , developed at the astronomical institute of the university of vienna ( latest version from : + ftp://dsn.astro.univie.ac.at./pub/period98/current/ ) .",
    "our analysis clearly shows that there are peaks at @xmath46 d@xmath13 , corresponding to a 1.735 d period , and at @xmath47 d@xmath13 , corresponding to the 6.69 d period .",
    "the 1.735 d period is exactly 1/2 of the 3.47 d period and the reason that it shows up in the amplitude spectrum is because of the double - wave light curve ( two eclipses in pair b ) , consistent with our ground - based photometry .",
    "moffat & shara ( 1986 ) also deduced that pair a had a single minimum at phase 0.00 ( @xmath48d ) and pair b had a double minimum at phases 0.00 and 0.50 ( @xmath49 d ) .",
    "our photometry of wr137 reveals only small amplitude ( @xmath50 0.03 mag in the @xmath1 passband ) random light variations .",
    "no periodicity could be found .",
    "these variations should be attributed to the continuum and they are probably due to dynamical wind instabilities .",
    "wr140 exhibited remarkable light variations and a shallow light dip is seen in all passbands shortly after periastron passage in 1993 .",
    "the light attenuation lasted until 1997 or even 1998 , probably because of a dust envelope built around the wr star by wind - wind interaction at periastron passage .",
    "the dust envelope was gradually dispersed . from the wavelength dependence of the light attenuation",
    ", we find strong evidence for rayleigh ( mie - like ) scattering , contributing to the opacity , in addition to electron scattering .    for wr148 ,",
    "our photometric study confirms the 4.317364 d light variation , but reveals occasional scatter , disturbing the light curve shape . on one occasion",
    ", we see a flare - like event at a phase when the companion is in front .",
    "our photometry reveals long - term variations of the mean light and , possibly , of the amplitude of the regular variation .",
    "there is some evidence for a periodicity of the long - term light variation and a 4 year cycle can not be ruled out .",
    "our photometry of wr153 is consistent with the quadruple model for this star and both the 6.6884 d and the 3.4696 d periods are seen in the light . in pair a ( 6.6884d period )",
    "we found evidence for an atmospheric eclipse , in agreement with the results of other works , while in pair b ( 3.4696 d period ) the eclipse is probably photospheric ( core eclipse ) .",

    "<S> in 1991 , a long term @xmath0-photometry campaign of four wolf - rayet stars was started using the 60 cm telescope of the national astronomical observatory rozhen , bulgaria . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on our observational results and discuss the light variations .    the star wr137 was observed during 1991 - 1998 . </S>",
    "<S> no indications of eclipses were found , though random light variations with small amplitudes exist , which are probably due to dynamical wind instabilities .    </S>",
    "<S> wr140 was also monitored between 1991 and 1998 . in 1993 , </S>",
    "<S> a dip in the light curve in all passbands was observed shortly after periastron passage , with amplitude of 0.03mag in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is interpreted in terms of an `` eclipse '' by dust condensation in the wr - wind . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the eclipse increases towards shorter wavelengths ; thus , electron scattering alone is not sufficient to explain the observations . </S>",
    "<S> an additional source of opacity is required , possibly rayleigh scattering . </S>",
    "<S> after the eclipse , the light in all passbands gradually increased to reach the `` pre - eclipse '' level in 1998 . </S>",
    "<S> the very broad shape of the light minimum suggests that a dust envelope was built up around the wr - star at periastron passage by wind - wind interaction , and was gradually dispersed after 1993 .    </S>",
    "<S> our observations of wr148 ( wr + c ? ) confirm the 4.3 d period ; however , they also show additional significant scatter . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting finding is a long - term variation of the mean light ( and , possibly , of the amplitude ) on a time scale of years . </S>",
    "<S> there is some indication of a 4 year cycle of that long - term variation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications for the binary model .    </S>",
    "<S> our photometry of wr153 is consistent with the quadruple model of this star by showing that both orbital periods , 6.7 d ( pair a ) and 3.5 d ( pair b ) , exist in the light variations . </S>",
    "<S> a search in the hipparcos photometric data also reveals both periods , which is an independant confirmation . </S>",
    "<S> no other periods in the light variability of that star are found . </S>",
    "<S> the longer period light curve shows only one minimum , which might be due to an atmospheric eclipse ; the shorter period light curve shows two minima , indicating that both stars in pair b are eclipsing each other . </S>"
