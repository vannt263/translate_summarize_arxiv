    "the mbh coincides with the compact , nonthermal radio source sagittarius  a@xmath0 ( sgr  a ) , but no emission at other wavelengths has been convincingly associated with it (  [ sec : radio ] ) .",
    "it is also well known that the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath21 ) and the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath22 ) of sgr  a  are far lower than expected from the standard thin accretion disk model used in the study of x - ray binaries and quasars ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) . in the standard model",
    ", @xmath27 of the luminosity is in x - rays @xcite , so one would expect @xmath28 ergs s@xmath8 , if sgr  a  were radiating at the eddington rate .",
    "the mbh at sgr  a  has been undetected in the 210  kev band with @xmath29 ergs s@xmath8 (  [ sec : x - ray ] ) , which is @xmath30 times fainter than the x - ray luminosity that would be expected at the eddington rate .",
    "similarly , the @xmath31  mbhs at the cores of several nearby spiral galaxies emit @xmath32 ergs s@xmath8 , implying that they are @xmath33 times fainter in x - rays than would be expected at their eddington rates @xcite .",
    "the absence of a strong , compact x - ray source associated with the mbh at the galactic center has been one of the profound mysteries of high - energy astrophysics and must have at least one of three basic causes .",
    "first , the mbh may reside in an environment where the accretion rate @xmath34  yr@xmath8 , either because the ambient gas has extremely low density , or because it is too hot or is moving too fast to accrete efficiently , or because it is dynamically ejected prior to accretion . here",
    "@xmath35 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow and @xmath36 is the speed of light .",
    "second , the mechanism of accretion may be such that the radiative efficiency is extremely low .",
    "the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; * ? ? ? * )  and related models can achieve low values of @xmath37 and have been intensively applied to the sgr  a  problem .",
    "third , the x - ray emission from sgr  a  may be much higher than observed due to anisotropy ( e.g. , a relativistic beam oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane ) and/or extremely high absorption along the line - of - sight .    the recently launched _",
    "chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( _ cxo _ ) with its advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector provides a unique opportunity to advance our knowledge of x - ray emission from sgr  a. it combines a superb mirror with sub - arcsecond resolution and an imaging detector with high efficiency over a broad x - ray band and moderate spectral resolution .",
    "the spatial resolution and accurate astrometry are essential to discriminate emission from sgr  a  from x - rays produced in the surrounding compact cluster of massive stars and other hot plasma in the region .",
    "the sensitivity of _ chandra_/acis at high x - ray energies is essential to penetrate the high interstellar column density along the line - of - sight to the galactic center (  [ sec : radio ] ) .",

    "this is the first of several papers arising from this _ chandra _  observation : our analysis of the x - ray emission from sgr  a east is presented by @xcite .",
    "future papers will present our studies of the x - ray emission from the point sources and the diffuse plasma distributed throughout the field .",
    "sgr  a  is a compact , nonthermal radio source @xcite .",
    "radio proper motion studies performed over the last decade place sgr  a  at the dynamical center of the galaxy and set a lower limit on its mass of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it has an intrinsic radio brightness temperature @xmath39  k @xcite and is weakly variable on timescales of less than about a month in the centimeter and millimeter bands @xcite .",
    "these properties are reminiscent of the compact nuclear radio sources present in radio - loud quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and suggest that sgr  a  may derive its luminosity from matter accreting onto the mbh at the center of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "polarimetric and spectro - polarimetric observations made with the very large array ( vla ) and the berkeley - illinois - maryland - association ( bima ) radio interferometers show that sgr  a  is linearly unpolarized at frequencies up to at least 86  ghz @xcite ; the upper - limit on linear polarization at 86  ghz is 1% .",
    "@xcite  report the detection of linear polarization from sgr  a  at 750 , 850 , 1350 , and 2000  with the scuba camera on the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "after removing the effects of strong free - free emission and polarized dust from the single - dish jcmt beam ( 34  at 150 ghz ) , @xcite  report the fractional linear polarization at 2000  ( 150  ghz ) to be @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite  detect circular polarization of sgr  a  at 4.8 and 8.4  ghz with the vla ; the fractional circular polarization at 4.8  ghz is @xmath41 .",
    "the circular polarization at 4.8  ghz is confirmed independently by @xcite  with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "@xcite  reviews the current state of radio polarization observations of sgr  a. he reports significant variability of the circularly polarized flux on timescales of a few days .",
    "this has important implications for the emission mechanism(s ) at radio and ( perhaps ) higher frequencies .",
    "the total radio luminosity of sgr  a  is estimated to be a few hundred  @xcite .",
    "this raises the possibility that the emission could result from accretion onto a cluster of compact stellar - mass objects @xcite .",
    "however , recent proper motion studies of stars within 6  of the galactic center constrain the minimum mass density of the central gravitational potential to be @xmath42  pc@xmath43 @xcite . the best - fit model from @xcite  requires a dark central object of mass @xmath44 within @xmath45  pc of sgr  a  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "these results rule out a cluster of compact stellar mass objects as the energy source for sgr  a  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but provide no direct evidence that the central engine is a mbh . furthermore , dynamical studies can not provide the spectral information needed to identify the underlying emission mechanism or mechanisms .",
    "numerous models have been proposed which can produce centimeter through millimeter band spectra that are at least roughly consistent with the observations , but this spectral range is too narrow to identify uniquely the nature of the central engine .",
    "what is needed is a detection or strict upper limit on the flux of sgr  a  at higher frequencies to fix the overall spectrum on both ends .",
    "a few claims have been made in the literature for the detection of sgr  a  in the mid- and near - ir @xcite .",
    "however , the search for an infrared ( ir ) counterpart to sgr  a  is hampered by source confusion and the strong ir background in the galactic center .",
    "precise astrometric alignment of ir images with radio maps using oh / ir stars that are also masers indicates that none of the confirmed ir sources seen so far can be associated definitively with the position of sgr  a  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , none of the near - ir sources yet stands out spectroscopically as a possibly non - stellar object .",
    "consequently , claims of detection of ir emission from sgr  a  are widely viewed as upper limits at this time .",
    "the galactic center is heavily obscured by gas and dust in the optical and ultraviolet wavebands ( @xmath46  mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thirty magnitudes of visual extinction corresponds to a column density @xmath47 @xmath7 @xcite , so the obscuring medium becomes partially transparent to x - rays from the galactic center at energies @xmath48  kev .",
    "x - ray observations thus provide our best opportunity to constrain the high - frequency end of the spectral energy distribution of sgr  a. since strong , hard x - ray emission is a characteristic property of agn , sgr  a  is expected to be an x - ray source if it derives its energy from accretion onto a massive black hole .",
    "however , no definitive detection of x - ray emission from sgr  a  had been made prior to the launch of _ chandra _  in july of 1999 .",
    "x - ray observations of the regions surrounding sgr  a  were carried out with very early rocket- and balloon - borne instruments ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but detailed observations started with _ einstein _ , the first satellite equipped with x - ray imaging optics @xcite .",
    "_ einstein _  observed the galactic center twice , 6 months apart , with the ipc ( 0.54.0  kev ) for a total of 18.3  ks and once with the hri ( 0.54.5  kev ) for 9.1  ks .",
    "einstein_/ipc images have an angular resolution of @xmath49 and reveal 12 discrete sources within the central @xmath50 of the galaxy . the error box for the strongest of these sources ( 1e  1742.5@xmath512859 )",
    "is centered only 20  from the position of sgr  a. assuming an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath52  kev and @xmath53 @xmath7 , @xcite  estimate the absorption - corrected 0.54.5  kev luminosity of this source to be @xmath54 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "the _ einstein _",
    "images show that the discrete sources are embedded in a bright , @xmath55 elliptically shaped region of apparently diffuse emission lying along the galactic plane that accounts for 85% of all the emission from that region .",
    "no variability was detected in the point sources over the 6-month baseline .",
    "einstein_/hri image is essentially blank due to the high absorbing column and the low detection efficiency of that instrument .    @xcite  observed the galactic center with the _ rosat_/pspc for 50  ks in march 1992 and detected 14 sources within the central @xmath56 of the galaxy . with the relatively high spatial resolution of 1020  ( fwhm ) , they resolved 1e  1742.5@xmath512859 into three sources , one of which ( rx  j1745.6@xmath512900 ) is coincident with the radio position of sgr  a  to within 10 . the high absorption column and the soft energy band ( 0.12.5  kev ) of the pspc limited their ability to fit the spectrum and to constrain the spectral parameters .",
    "hard x - ray observations ( 230  kev ) centered on sgr  a  have been made with non - imaging instruments @xcite .",
    "the line - of - sight to the galactic center becomes optically thin to hard x - rays , hence the fluxes measured by these missions are nearly free from the effects of absorption .",
    "these observations suggest the presence of a long - term variable source near the position of sgr  a  with the measured 310  kev flux varying over the range ( 2@xmath57 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath8 , corresponding to an unabsorbed luminosity of about ( 2@xmath58 ergs s@xmath8 . in order to simultaneously reproduce the low - energy spectrum measured with _ rosat _  and a higher energy spectrum ( 420  kev ) measured with the art - p telescope on _ granat _  @xcite ,",

    "consequently , the accretion models in these papers , which are based in part on fits to the luminosity reported by @xcite , underestimate the upper - limits on the accretion rate and the x - ray luminosity of sgr  a  in 1992 by 12 orders of magnitude.[foot : rosat ] ]    the first hard x - ray imaging ( up to 10  kev ) with modest spatial resolution ( 3 ) was made in 1993 with _",

    "additional filtering was performed to exclude periods of time during which large background flares saturated telemetry , causing the majority of frames in these intervals to be lost .",
    "the total exposure time after filtering was 37.3  ks for s3 and 40.3  ks for each of the frontside - illuminated chips .",
    "analyses of on - orbit data by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) and others have shown that the frontside - illuminated ccds occasionally exhibit `` flaring pixels '' .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when a cosmic ray deposits a large amount of charge in traps at the interface between the active region and the insulating layer of the gate structure .",
    "the de - trapping time constant is longer than the integration time between frames , so events with identical grades are reported in the same pixel in up to 7 consecutive frames .",

    "half of this offset ( 026 ) is attributable to the uncertainties in centroiding and astrometry .",
    "the remaining offset may be due either to our underestimation of the astrometric errors or to a complex morphology of the source on a sub - arcsecond scale (  [ sec : sgra_star_morph ] ) .",

    ", the resultant 0.57  kev source list contains 119 absorbed sources that lie within 8  of sgr  a. of these 119 sources , only was brighter than during the observation .    to determine the radial distribution of the sources on the sky , we count up the number of sources in concentric annuli centered on sgr  a , using 1-wide annuli , and fit the distribution with a power - law model .",
    "the best - fit radial surface density profile is given by the equation @xmath140 sources per square arcminute , where @xmath141 is the offset angle from sgr  a  in arcminutes .",

    "we note , however , that the radial profile given above overpredicts the density of sources at small radii , because the source detection efficiency of the combined hrma / acis instrument drops off with increasing off - axis angle due to the combined effects of the increasing psf size and the decreasing effective area .",
    "the integration requires an extrapolation of over an order of magnitude toward smaller radii , so even a small flattening of the slope would cause a significant decrease in the predicted number of sources in the central arcsecond . the probability given above",

    "we will address these problems in our subsequent paper on the point sources .",
    "spatial analysis of the morphology of the source coincident with sgr  a  and of two nearby point sources (  and ) indicates that sgr  a  may be slightly extended ( see fig .",

    "the enlarged widths are attributed to three factors : ( 1 ) a minor problem with the aspect solution ( see below ) ; ( 2 ) the 0.5-pixel randomization introduced into the event positions by the cxc standard processing pipeline but not included in the psf size calculation , and ( 3 ) the fact that the hrma psf more closely resembles a lorentzian than a gaussian .",
    "examination of the aspect solution file shows three discontinuities in the curves recording the position of the science instrument module ( sim ) translation stage during the course of the observation .",
    "the cxc has determined that this problem is caused by warm pixels in the aspect camera that sometimes fall near one of the fiducial lights used to monitor sim drift .",
    "the amplitudes of the discontinuities are @xmath144 along the z - axis of the sim and @xmath145 along the y - axis .",
    "the spacecraft roll angle was 2685 , so the z- and y - axes were aligned nearly e - w and n - s , respectively .",
    "these discontinuities broadened the widths of all the source profiles , but the effect on the source centroids used to determine positions on the sky should not be a problem since all sources experienced the same pattern .",
    "the fact that the two comparison sources have narrower profiles than sgr  a  indicates that the aspect errors can not account entirely for its apparent extent . a proper study of the spatial morphology of sgr  a  will require careful analysis of the cycle  1 data , after reprocessing to correct for the aspect problem .",

    ", frequent collisions with surrounding stars would cause any binaries to harden rapidly , leading either to disruption of the main - sequence star or to formation of short - lived common - envelope systems . in either case , the lifetimes of binaries in the cusp are probably relatively brief .    in summary ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity and spectrum of sgr  a  are not extremely different from those seen in colliding wind wr binaries , but the absence of any  star coincident with the x - ray source casts doubt on the presence of an appropriate binary at the correct location .",

    "these models assume quasi - spherical infall onto the mbh .    in the bondi model @xcite , the highly supersonic stellar winds flowing past sgr  a  form a bow shock that dissipates the bulk motion of the gas and heats it to a temperature of @xmath280  k. the ionized gas",
    "is then assumed to free - fall radially with no net angular momentum until it reaches the circularization radius at @xmath281 , where @xmath282 is the schwarzschild radius of the mbh . gravitational binding energy released during infall",
    "is transferred to the compressed magnetic field , which heats the ionized gas through some combination of magneto - sonic and/or magneto - turbulent processes .",
    "plasma microinstabilities and collective effects are then invoked to set up thermal equilibrium between the electrons and ions on a timescale shorter than the infall timescale .",
    "the ionized gas within the keplerian region is assumed to infall on a timescale much shorter than the cooling time ; consequently the thermal energy stored in the gas is lost as the gas crosses the event horizon of the mbh .    in the adaf models",
    "@xcite , the gas is assumed to accrete with angular momentum .",
    "turbulent magnetic viscosity dissipates energy and transfers angular momentum outward through the flow , allowing the accreting material to move inward .",
    "the bulk of the viscous energy is assumed to be deposited in the ions , with only a small fraction of the energy transmitted directly to the electrons .",
    "it is further assumed that electrons and ions interact only via the coulomb process .",
    "the ions , mainly protons , are unable to radiate efficiently and maintain a temperature @xmath283 close to the virial temperature at all radii ( @xmath284 , where @xmath285 ) . the electrons , on the other hand , radiate effectively via thermal bremsstrahlung at larger radii and also via synchrotron and compton processes nearer the mbh . at large radii , coulomb scattering keeps the electrons and ions at a common temperature , but at smaller radii the relaxation timescale is longer than the infall timescale , and their temperatures diverge .",
    "the electron temperature begins to saturate at @xmath286 r@xmath287 , reaching a maximum of @xmath288  k near the mbh .",
    "thus , a two - temperature plasma develops in the flow with the ions advecting the bulk of the released binding energy through the event horizon .",
    "the standard bondi and adaf models both assume the x - ray emission from sgr  a  is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung emission from electrons in the hot optically thin accretion flow .",
    "both models can fit the absorption - corrected 210  kev luminosity measured with _ chandra _  ( @xmath289 ergs s@xmath8 ) by adjusting the accretion rate downward by factors of a few from their best - fit values to the _ rosat _  upper - limit ( but see footnote  [ foot : rosat ]  in  [ sec : x - ray ] ) . given the large uncertainty in the actual accretion rate onto sgr",
    "a  from the stellar winds , the measured luminosity alone can not exclude either model ; however , it can be used to fix the accretion rate at the bondi radius and thus provides an important constraint on all hot accretion flow models ( see  [ sec : mdot ] ) .    for both models ,",
    "the predicted intrinsic spectrum in the _ chandra_band ( 0.110  kev ) has photon index @xmath290 ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "however , in the bondi model the emission arises from a region within the circularization radius ( @xmath291 ) , while in the adaf model the spectrum is dominated by emission from cooler gas at large radii ( @xmath292 ) .",
    "this difference in the location of the dominant emitting region may be significant , as discussed below .",
    "the best - fit , absorbed power - law model to the _ chandra _  spectrum has @xmath293 , which is much steeper than the predicted bondi / adaf spectra in the literature .",
    "interestingly , the predicted photon index for both models lies near the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval , even after adjusting for the systematic effects discussed in  [ sec : sgra_star_continuum ] . due to the poor photon statistics",
    ", we can not exclude the bondi / adaf models with the current data at the @xmath110 level .",
    "however , it is possible that further observations to measure the spectrum accurately might well enable us to exclude them in the near future .",
    "either way , the ability of _ chandra _  to resolve the x - ray emission from sgr  aout of the surrounding emission and to measure its spectrum will provide information crucial to theoretical efforts to understand the accretion and emission mechanisms in this source .",
    "recently , models have been developed in which it is proposed that not all the matter in the accretion flow at large radii makes its way to small radii and thence through the event horizon .",
    "the bernoulli parameter in adaf models is positive @xcite , which means the gas accretes with positive energy and may escape .",
    "they propose that only a small fraction of the matter ( @xmath294 ) in the outer accretion flow makes it to the event horizon and that the binding energy released by this matter is transported to the outer parts of the flow , where it drives a substantial wind that carries off most of the matter .",
    "hence , the amount of matter actually accreting through the event horizon is substantially reduced .",
    "lowering the accretion rate at small radii would alleviate the need for the flow onto sgr  a  to have a radiative efficiency @xmath295 .",
    "this is a very appealing concept , since such a low radiative efficiency would require that turbulent processes transfer energy from the protons to the electrons at an extremely low rate . as noted by @xcite , their adiabatic inflow - outflow solutions ( adios ) model generalizes the adaf model to include the effects of a wind .",
    "@xcite  have computed spectral models for sgr  a  using an adaf+wind model .",
    "it has also been realized that adafs are unstable to convection for small values of the dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath296 .",
    "this has given rise to convection - dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ) models @xcite , in which it is proposed that convection transfers angular momentum inward and energy outward through the flow .",
    "the inward transfer of angular momentum almost cancels out the normal outward transfer of angular momentum , and the energy transported outward from the inner parts of the accretion flow heats the outer regions of the flow , retarding the rate of accretion . the net effect on the flow",
    "is that most of the matter circulates in convective eddies at large radii , rather than falling inward toward the event horizon .",
    "eventually , this excess matter must be lost from the accretion flow in some manner , since otherwise a massive disk would build up over time .",
    "one consequence of these new models is that the mass density distribution in the accretion flow rises less steeply toward the center . in the standard bondi / adaf models ,",
    "the density ( @xmath297 ) varies with radius ( @xmath298 ) as @xmath299 , while in the cdaf / adaf+wind models @xmath300 . here",
    "@xmath301 is a variable used to parameterize the effect of a wind or convection on the density profile as a function of radius .",
    "consequently , the accretion rate @xmath302 is constant with radius in the bondi / adaf models , while in the cdaf / adaf+wind models it varies with radius ( @xmath303 ; @xmath304 ) .    in the context of their adaf+wind model ,",
    "@xciteinvestigate the effect of wind strength on the spectrum .",
    "they find that , ignoring the weak frequency dependence of the gaunt factor , the predicted spectrum in the _ chandra _  band has photon index @xmath305 , where @xmath306 is the power - law index of the electron temperature profile ( @xmath307 ) in the outer parts of the flow .",
    "comparing this to our measured spectrum of sgr  a , we find that the adaf model can be reconciled with the soft spectrum ( @xmath308 ) of sgr  a  if a substantial wind or strong convection ( @xmath309 ) is present .    assuming that the observed x - ray spectrum is thermal bremsstrahlung from a hot accretion flow onto sgr  a  and using the current best - fit photon index ,",
    "the predicted density profile through the flow would vary roughly as @xmath310 in these models .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty in the measured photon index is too large to put tight constraints on the parameter @xmath301 and hence on the density profile at this time .",
    "values of @xmath301 ranging from @xmath3111 are currently acceptable .",
    "fortunately , the observations needed to put useful constraints on the density profile are entirely feasible with _ chandra_/acis .      assuming the observed x - ray emission is from a hot , optically thin thermal plasma accreting onto the mbh , we use our best - fit raymond - smith model to estimate the accretion rate at the bondi radius ( @xmath312 ) and to infer the accretion rate near the event horizon for the various hot accretion flow models discussed above .",
    "the best - estimate ambient plasma conditions are @xmath313 cm@xmath43 and @xmath314  kev ; the corresponding emission measure @xmath315 @xmath207  pc , and the total mass of the plasma is @xmath316  .",
    "the equation for the accretion radius is @xmath317 , where @xmath318 is the gravitational constant , @xmath319 is the mass of the black hole at sgr  a , and @xmath320 is the speed of sound in the plasma .",
    "the sound speed is given by the equation @xmath321 km s@xmath8 , which is comparable to the bulk velocities of the stellar winds ( @xmath3221000 km s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "here @xmath323 is the adiabatic index , @xmath324 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath325 and @xmath326 are the temperature and mean atomic weight of the gas , and @xmath327 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the process is adiabatic ( @xmath328 ) and that the gas is fully ionized with twice solar abundances ( @xmath329 ) . substituting the value for the sound speed into the equation above",
    ", we find that @xmath330 ( 13 ) , comparable to the 15 radius of the circle used to extract the spectrum . in the analysis to follow , we adopt @xmath331  pc ( 15 or @xmath332 ) for the outer radius of the accretion flow .    using a simple model by @xcite ,",
    "the accretion rate at @xmath333 is then @xmath334  yr@xmath8 , where @xmath335 for an adiabatic process , and @xmath336 is the plasma density .",
    "this value for the accretion rate lies 12 orders of magnitude below the most recent published estimates for the mass supply rate available from the stellar winds ( see the discussion at the beginning of  [ sec : mbh_models ] ) .",
    "the accretion rate for the standard adaf model is related to the bondi accretion rate by @xmath337 , where @xmath15 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter in the standard thin accretion disk model @xcite .",
    "then @xmath338  yr@xmath8 at @xmath312 . for the adios / cdaf models , the accretion rate scales as a function of radius as @xmath339 . using @xmath340",
    "derived above from the _ chandra _  spectrum , the predicted accretion rate across the event horizon would be @xmath341  yr@xmath8 . in the cdaf model , the density profile is expected to be @xmath342 , so @xmath301 should equal 1 , which is within the uncertainties allowed by the _ chandra _  spectrum . thus",
    ", scaling the _ chandra_results using the cdaf model gives an accretion rate at the event horizon of @xmath343 yr@xmath8 .",
    "recently , @xcite  reported the detection of linearly polarized radio emission from sgr  a  at frequencies above 150  ghz ( see  [ sec : radio ] ) .",
    "@xcite  and @xciteshow that the detection of linear polarization implies the faraday rotation measure must be small and derive strong upper limits on the density and magnetic field strength at small radii in the accretion flow , where the polarized synchrotron emission is generated .",
    "both groups find that @xmath344  yr@xmath8 is required at small radii to prevent faraday rotation from depolarizing the synchrotron emission and propose that a cdaf or adaf with an outflow could satisfy the conditions . comparing this limit derived from radio observations to the estimates we derived above from our _ chandra",
    "_  data indicates that these models could plausibly satisfy this requirement .",
    "theoretical studies of x - ray emission lines in hot accretion flows indicate that flows with strong winds should have stronger emission lines than flows with weak or no winds @xcite .",
    "detection of an fe  k@xmath15 line at 6.7  kev in the sgr  aspectrum would be a strong argument for the existence of a hot thermal accretion flow , since synchrotron models do not produce such a line , and for the presence of a strong wind or convection .",
    "in addition , emission - line ratios could provide powerful diagnostics of the run of density and temperature with radius in the flow .",
    "the first crucial step is to improve the signal - to - noise of the spectrum at 67  kev in order to assess our possible detection of @xmath345 line emission from highly ionized iron .",
    "this will require significantly more observing time with _",
    "another emission mechanism which has been invoked recently to account in particular for the x - ray flux from this source is inverse compton scattering of radio photons .",
    "the population of relativistic electrons responsible for producing the radio synchrotron emission is also held responsible for upscattering those photons into the x - ray band by inverse compton scattering @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is testable , inasmuch as it predicts that the x - ray flux is closely linked to one component of the radio spectrum and that they should vary in unison .",
    "the primary distinction between existing synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models lies in the nature and location of the responsible electrons .",
    "@xcite  invoke a quasi - monoenergetic electron distribution at 30 or 40  @xmath282 to account for the entire radio spectrum and predict an ssc luminosity of @xmath346 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , associate the x - ray flux with radio emission generated in the @xmath347 nozzle of a hypothetical jet . in their model ,",
    "the jet nozzle is responsible for the sub - millimeter bump in the radio spectrum ( the centimeter - wavelength flux comes from much larger distances in the jet ) , so it is the temporal variations of this component , on estimated time scales of @xmath163 days , which they expect to vary with the x - ray flux . a relativistic @xmath323 factor for the electrons of about 100 is needed to produce both the correct sub - millimeter spectrum _ and _ the x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite  similarly associate the x - ray flux with the sub - millimeter bump via the ssc process .",
    "they , however , place the synchrotron source at @xmath348 in the inner keplerian region of the accretion disk , within the circularization radius of the accreting plasma .",
    "they stress the importance of simultaneity of future radio and x - ray measurements , not simply because the radio source is variable on time scales less than a year , but also because the x - ray flux variations are expected to be much stronger than those in the sub - millimeter .",
    "a change of a factor of two in the sub - millimeter flux would lead to a change in the x - ray flux by as much as a factor or 10 or 20 .",
    "there are a number of measurements that could be used to distinguish between the thermal bremsstrahlung and the ssc emission models .",
    "first , the bremsstrahlung models do not predict the correlated variability between the radio ( cm to sub - mm ) and the x - ray bands that the ssc models do .",
    "second , x - rays from the ssc process would vary rapidly as a result of the proximity of their source to the mbh , while x - ray bremsstrahlung arising at larger radii should vary more slowly .",
    "third , the extended source we have observed should appear more point - like when it brightens if some of the x - rays are produced via the ssc mechanism near the mbh , while the more extended emission requires a thermal mechanism .",
    "fourth , the x - ray spectrum should not show strong emission lines if it is dominated by the ssc mechanism , while the emission from the thermal model may show strong lines . as discussed above , it is possible that both emission components may be present . in that case , analyses of changes in the morphology and spectrum of the source as it brightens and dims could be used to determine the relative strengths of the two components .",
    "the models discussed in the previous sections are based on the assumption that the mbh is accreting matter from the stellar winds of the nearby massive stars . however , it is conceivable that the mbh is embedded in a hot x - ray - emitting gaseous region and not the cooler plasma ( @xmath349  k ) emerging from the stellar cluster .    it is evident from figures  [ fig : sgra_east][fig : raw_central_arcmin ] that hot plasma is prevalent throughout the central @xmath272  pc of the galaxy , and is concentrated with higher densities in the innermost @xmath350  pc .",
    "this x - ray plasma will homogenize on timescales @xmath351 years , where @xmath352 km s@xmath8 is the sound speed and @xmath353  pc is the characteristic length scale of the inner region around sgr  a. the morphology of the diffuse emission appears complex and is not symmetrical about sgr  a suggesting that it formed recently or is subject to external forces .",
    "if the high surface brightness of the diffuse x - rays indicates the presence of a local hot ism surrounding sgr  a , then it could be the main source of material for accretion onto the mbh .",
    "the local diffuse plasma has @xmath354  kev and density @xmath355 cm@xmath43 (  [ sec : diffuse_spec ] and table  [ tab : spec ] ) .",
    "if this plasma is stationary with respect to the mbh , the bondi - hoyle accretion rate would be @xmath356  yr@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this accretion rate decreases if the local medium is moving past the mbh at a rate @xmath357 , roughly as @xmath358 .",
    "the relationships between the x - ray emitting plasma seen in the acis images and other gaseous structures observed or inferred to be present are very unclear .",
    "first , the stellar winds from the massive ob / wr stars in the cluster centered @xmath359  pc from the mbh may create a cavity of rapidly moving stellar gas within the hot ambient medium .",
    "this is the model discussed above and in most studies of sgr  aaccretion .",
    "the ram pressure of the winds is estimated to be 12 orders of magnitude greater than the thermal pressure of the ambient medium and should dominate the ambient medium close to the stellar cluster . however , if the winds were to extend to very large distances without thermalizing to x - ray temperatures , the observed cusp in the diffuse x - ray emission should not be present .",
    "the spatial configuration of and the pressure balance between the cluster , mbh , and ambient x - ray medium are thus not well established at the present time .",
    "the relationships between the ambient x - ray plasma and other gaseous components in the sgr  a region are similarly unclear .",
    "first , as discussed by @xcite , the local plasma may have been recently compressed or pushed aside by the passage of the supernova shock wave of sgr  a east .",
    "second , the hot medium may envelop the cooler spiral - shaped clouds of sgr  a west ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sgra_west ] ) . if these clouds originated in the surrounding molecular ring , they are likely subject to heating and evaporation as they orbit inward towards the center .    at the present time , we are unable to determine whether the local diffuse x - ray - emitting medium does or does not affect the accretion onto the mbh",
    ". however , future investigations of these issues must consider the ambient hot plasma , which is imaged at high spatial resolution for the first time in this study .",
    "in this paper , we have presented results of our first - epoch observation of the galactic center performed with the acis - i instrument on the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. we have produced the first high spatial resolution ( @xmath1 ) , hard x - ray ( 0.57  kev ) spectroscopic image of the central 40  pc ( 17 ) of the galaxy .",
    "most importantly , we have resolved the x - ray emission from the central parsec of the galaxy and discovered a source , , coincident with the radio position of sgr  a  to within 035 , corresponding to a maximum projected distance of 16 light - days .",
    "over 150 point sources are detected in the acis field of view : an increase in the x - ray source density at the galactic center of more than an order of magnitude over that detected by previous x - ray satellites .",
    "a primary goal of this project is the search for an x - ray counterpart to sgr  a , the compact nonthermal radio source associated with the mbh at the dynamical center of the galaxy .",
    "the x - ray source we have detected at the position of sgr  a  has the following properties , with the most secure results listed first :    1 .",
    "the 210  kev luminosity is @xmath289 ergs s@xmath8 , assuming the emission is isotropic (  [ sec : sgra_star_continuum ] ) .",
    "this is @xmath360 times fainter than the upper limits obtained with previous x - ray satellites (  [ sec : x - ray ] ) and @xmath361 times fainter than the x - ray luminosity that would be expected from the standard black - hole thin accretion disk model , if the source were radiating at the eddington luminosity of the mbh (  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the extremely low observed x - ray emissivity of the central mbh is a very powerful constraint on any model .",
    "the spectrum is well fit either by an absorbed power - law model with photon index @xmath362 or by an absorbed optically thin thermal plasma model with @xmath363  kev . in either case ,",
    "the column density @xmath364 @xmath7 (  [ sec : sgra_star_continuum ] ) . the spectrum is softer than the canonical agn photon index with @xmath3652.0 .",
    "this latter result is not definitive due to the poor statistics of this faint source .",
    "3 .   the source appears extended with diameter @xmath1 (  [ sec : sgra_star_morph ] ) .",
    "this is very close to the resolution limit of _ chandra_/acis and should be confirmed with higher photon statistics from additional observations .",
    "the inner region of this small structure may have varied on timescales of @xmath366  hr with a factor of 2 amplitude (  [ sec : sgra_star_ltc ] ) .",
    "this result is also photon limited , with @xmath14 significance .",
    "tentative evidence for a @xmath367 line at 6.7  kev from he - like iron is seen with @xmath16 significance (  [ sec : sgra_star_fek ] ) .    based on the fluxes and the spatial distribution of the x - ray sources in the field , we estimate that the probability of detecting an absorbed source by random chance that is as bright or brighter than the sgr  a  candidate and that lies within @xmath368 of the radio position is @xmath369 .",
    "the nearest windy emission - line stars are too far away ( @xmath3702 ) to account for the x - ray source , and other classes of normal stars are too soft to penetrate the high absorbing column .",
    "colliding winds in o+o binaries in the central stellar cusp may be able to produce the required luminosity , but their spectra might be too soft .",
    "a large population of young , magnetically active low - mass stars in the cusp could produce the observed luminosity and spectrum , but there is currently no evidence in the radio or ir bands that such stars are actually present .",
    "a population of @xmath270 compact stellar - mass objects accreting hydrodynamically from the ambient medium appears an unlikely origin for the emission , since their cumulative luminosity would be many orders of magnitude fainter than that of a single @xmath273  black hole .",
    "it is possible that the emission could originate in an accreting x - ray binary system within the cusp , but the expected number of x - ray binaries is @xmath371 .    assuming the observed emission within 15 of sgr  a  is from accretion onto the mbh",
    ", we can use the observed properties of the source to constrain the models . due to the limited photon statistics , the luminosity and spectral shape of the source",
    "can be fit either by an optically thin thermal plasma model or by an ssc model .",
    "the apparent extent of the source and the possible detection of an fe line support the thermal model , while the possible detection of rapid variability supports the ssc model .",
    "the current observations , while of limited signal - to - noise , are thus consistent with the presence of both thermal and nonthermal emission components in the sgr  aspectrum .",
    "the results presented in this paper have demonstrated the great potential of _",
    "chandra_/acis to revolutionize our understanding of highly energetic phenomena in the central parsec of our galaxy .",
    "no other x - ray satellite for the foreseeable future will have its unique combination of arcsecond resolution , high sensitivity , broad energy band , and moderate spectral resolution .",
    "these properties are indispensable for this study .",
    "the results also show that further observations are needed to increase the photon statistics .",
    "an improved spectrum could be used to constrain the continuum shape and to search for an emission line at 6.7  kev .",
    "detection of such a line , for example , would show conclusively that a thermal component is present , while a nondetection would put tight constraints on the strength of a wind or outflow in the thermal models .",
    "the ssc models predict that the x - ray emission should be variable and show a close correlation with variations in the millimeter band .",
    "a vigorous campaign of simultaneous monitoring in the x - ray and millimeter bands is needed to test this prediction .",
    "likewise , increased photon statistics could be used to measure changes in the morphology of the emission from the source , if it varies , and to examine the size of the source as a function of energy .",
