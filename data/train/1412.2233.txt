    "stochastic theory has been a powerful tool to understand phenomena in various fields , such as physics  @xcite , chemistry  @xcite , biophysics  @xcite , and economics  @xcite . in particular , the langevin model with the white gaussian noise is often used in modeling fluctuating systems  @xcite .",
    "its microscopic foundation has been understood for a system driven by a single stochastic environment in terms of microscopic theories  @xcite .",
    "for example , van kampen s theory  @xcite predicts that a stochastic system associated with a single environment is asymptotically described by a gaussian model in the large system size limit ( or equivalently , the small noise limit ) .",
    "furthermore , the gaussian langevin model is sufficiently simple to be analytically solvable for a wide class of setups  @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "the gaussian langevin model has been accepted as a minimal model for the brownian motion with a single environment , and has played an important role in the recent development of thermodynamics of small systems  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , stochastic systems associated with multiple environments have not been fully understood .",
    "the role of multiple stochastic environments is significant for athermal systems , where both thermal and athermal fluctuations coexist because of external energy injection from the reservoirs .",
    "for example , athermal noise ( e.g. , avalanche  @xcite or shot noise  @xcite ) plays an important role as well as thermal noise in electrical circuits . in granular and biological systems",
    ", it is known that the granular noise  @xcite and active noise  @xcite , respectively , appear because of external vibration and consumption of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) .",
    "these systems can not be addressed by the conventional microscopic theories because they are coupled with multiple environments .",
    "a generalization of van kampen s approach toward athermal systems has recently been formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering systems associated with two different environments , i.e. , thermal and athermal environments . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is predicted that athermal stochastic systems are universally characterized by langevin - like equations driven by non - gaussian noise , which is consistent with experimental reports on athermal fluctuations in electric , granular , and biological systems  @xcite .",
    "such non - gaussian models are expected to be important in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics for athermal systems  @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the formulation in ref .",
    "@xcite to non - linear frictional systems .",
    "we asymptotically derive a non - linear langevin - like equation with non - gaussian noise in the small noise limit for the environments .",
    "we further obtain an analytic solution for an arbitrary non - gaussian langevin equation with a non - linear frictional force .",
    "we derive a full - order asymptotic formula in terms of a large frictional coefficient for the velocity distribution function ( vdf ) , and show that the first - order approximation corresponds to the independent - kick model , which was phenomenologically introduced in ref .",
    "we also show that the higher - order terms directly correspond to the multiple - kicks effect during relaxation , and introduce a diagrammatic representation to illustrate the higher - order terms . as a demonstration",
    ", we address the stochastic motion of a granular motor under dry friction to verify the validity of our theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 , we asymptotically derive the non - gaussian langevin equation with a non - linear friction by a small noise expansion . in sec.3 , we study the steady distribution function of the non - gaussian langevin equation , and derive the full - order asymptotic solution in terms of the inverse of the frictional coefficient . in sec.4 , we study a granular motor under dry friction and verify our formulation numerically . in appendix .  [ app : gmotor_viscous ] , we apply our formulation to the nonequilibrium steady state of a rotor in granular and molecular gases . in appendix .",
    "[ app : cn : integraleq ] , we derive the solution of the iterative integral equation for the fourier representation of the distribution . in appendix .",
    "[ app : cn : tail_cubic ] , we check the asymptotic tail of the fourier representation of the distribution for the cubic friction . in appendix .",
    "[ app : cn : renormalized ] , we check the validity of the first - order renormalized solution for the cubic friction . in appendix .",
    "[ app : cn_cumulant_g ] , we show the detailed derivation of the cumulant function for the granular noise . in appendix .",
    "[ app : cn_first_gm ] , we show the detailed derivation of the first - order formula of the steady distribution function for the granular motor .",
