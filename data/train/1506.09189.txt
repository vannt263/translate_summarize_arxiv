    "density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite is a powerful numerical method in various disciplinaries , e.g. , computational chemistry and computational materials science . in a typical calculation with dft , the total energy of a _",
    "static _ atomic ( or more precisely , ionic ) structure @xmath2  here @xmath3 is the coordinate of the @xmath4 ion  of a solid structure of @xmath5 atoms , is evaluated .",
    "the forces exerting on these ions can also be computed with the hellmann - feynman theorem@xcite and then be used to relax the structure , i.e. , to locate a local minimum of the potential energy surface in the configurational space .",
    "some materials properties , e.g. , band gap , can then be calculated on top of the relaxed structures obtained . because temperature is not included in the dft formalism , all of these properties , when calculated with dft , are valid at zero temperature ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "of particular interest are , however , certain materials properties at some sort of finite temperatures , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "technically , it is possible to evaluate some properties at non - zero temperatures , of course , with certain computational overhead .",
    "this contribution describes a method , which is based on lattice dynamics @xcite , for estimating the free energy of crystals at non - zero temperatures .",
    "presumably , this is one of the most desirable finite - temperature quantities as it determines pretty much the essential characters of a crystal @xcite . to be more precise , the free energy difference between systems and the gradients of the free energy with respect to thermodynamic variables are of practical interest .",
    "for instance , among various possible crystal structures , that with lowest - possible free energy is considered to be thermodynamically stable . for a chemical reaction",
    ", the free energy change is an useful parameter , indicating whether the reaction is spontaneous or not , and if not , how much energy is needed to make it occur .",
    "the gibbs free energy of an equilibrium ( relaxed ) structure @xmath8 at constant number of particles is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the internal energy , @xmath11 is the entropy , @xmath12 is the pressure , and @xmath13 is the volume ( per unit cell , for examples ) of the crystals .",
    "strictly , the ions are not frozen but perform certain vibrations in the neighborhood of @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason , the internal energy may be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the static internal energy at @xmath8 and @xmath16 is the vibrational internal energy @xcite . technically , @xmath15 is the total dft energy of the relaxed structure @xmath8 while @xmath17 can also readily be computed .",
    "the treatment for the remaining terms , i.e. , the vibrational free energy defined as @xmath18 , which is considered in details herein , is based on the calculations of the vibrational frequency spectra of the examined solids .",
    "this approach is well - established and has widely been used @xcite , showing some advantages and shortcomings which will also be discussed in this contribution .",
    "to focus on @xmath19 , we put the @xmath17 term of @xmath20 aside , and consider the helmholtz free energy @xmath21 . the formal definition of @xmath22 is@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the boltzmann s constant , and @xmath25 is the canonical partition function defined by @xmath26.\\ ] ] here , the integral is taken over all the possible atomic configuration @xmath2 of the system , and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the kinetic energy of the ionic lattice and @xmath29 is the potential of the ion structure . in principles ,",
    "the very - high - dimensional integral appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) can not be performed directly .",
    "it may , however , be sampled from a thermodynamic ensemble by a number of techniques , many of them are based on monte carlo like the bennett acceptance ratio method @xcite . for a better summary of such methods ,",
    "readers are referred to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lattice - dynamics approach for @xmath19 is started from the harmonic approximation of the potential energy @xmath30 , i.e. , @xcite @xmath31 in this expansion , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the displacement of ion @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) along the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) direction .",
    "it should be noted here that @xmath38 , the internal energy of the frozen ionic structure @xmath8 and @xmath39 . by ( [ eq : h1 ] )",
    ", the displacements are assumed to be small , and hence unharmonic terms like those arisen from substructure rorations and the translations ( these motions may be possible in some highly dynamical solids like complex borohydrides @xcite ) are not included . in the quantum description of the lattice vibrations ,",
    "a set of normal coordinates @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the planck constant ) are introduced so that @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the vibrational frequencies .",
    "the eigenenergies of @xmath45 are then @xmath46 in which @xmath47 . by inserting @xmath48 into ( [ eq : z ] ) ,",
    "one gets @xmath49 with @xmath50=\\prod_{\\nu=1}^{3n}\\left[2\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_\\nu}{2k_{\\rm b}t}\\right)\\right]^{-1}.\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) implies that @xmath19 is determined by @xmath51 , or @xmath52.\\ ] ] at the limit of @xmath53 , @xmath19 approaches the zero - point energy , which is given by @xmath54 in case the spectrum of @xmath55 is continuous , @xmath19 is written in terms of the normalized density of phonon states @xmath56 as @xmath57.\\ ] ] thus , given that the density of phonon states @xmath56 is determined by whatever method , the vibrational free energy @xmath19 can readily be calculated .",
    "the density of phonon states @xmath56 can be calculated numerically by some methods . here , we examine the prescriptions made available within the dft - based framework , leaving aside other methods , e.g. , that starts from the velocity autocorrelation function which can be accessible with molecular dynamics",
    ".    calculations of @xmath56 with dft involve the determination of phonon dispersion relation @xmath58  here @xmath59 is the phonon wave vector  by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix , defined as@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the mass of ions @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the sum in ( [ eq : d ] ) is taken over the index @xmath63 of the translational images of the crystal cell due to the periodicity . with the dynamical matrix @xmath64 introduced , the equation of motion of the vibrations",
    "is written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the coefficients of the transformation from @xmath32 to @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "thus , the problem of calculating the phonon dispersion @xmath58 of the @xmath68 normal phonon mode is reduced to the eigenvalue problem of @xmath69 , which can be solved numerically .    in practice , @xmath70 and @xmath58",
    "are computed by either the frozen - phonon method ( also referred to as the direct approach ) @xcite or the linear - response method @xcite .",
    "the former relies on evaluating the interatomic force constants of a large supercell in which the ions are perturbed from their equilibrium positions .",
    "the size of the supercell may be large , depending on the commensurability of the perturbations with the equilibrium cell .",
    "then , the obtained matrix of force constants is reduced to the dynamical matrix at certain values of @xmath59 which is then be diagonalized to obtain @xmath58 . in this method , a dft package like vasp@xcite or siesta @xcite is needed as a force calculator , while an additional software , e.g. , phonon @xcite , phonopy @xcite , and phon @xcite , is used for the pre- and post - processing calculations .    the linear - response method for calculating @xmath58 and @xmath56",
    "is based on the perturbation theory within dft@xcite . in this method ,",
    "the dynamical matrix is evaluated from the knowledge of the first - order response of the wave function with respect to the lattice potential perturbations @xcite .",
    "different from the frozen - phonon method which needs supercell to be constructed , the dynamical matrix is _ separately _ evaluated by linear - response calculations on the unit cell at various @xmath59 points .",
    "available packages that support the linear - response method for calculations of @xmath58 are , but not limited to , abinit @xcite and quantum espresso @xcite .    given that the phonon dispersion @xmath58 is determined , the density of phonon states @xmath56 and the vibrational free energy @xmath19 can be straightforwardly calculated , as supported by all of the codes / tools mentioned above .",
    "in addition , calculated @xmath58 is also very useful to examine the dynamical stability of crystal structures , especially those predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "in particular , if a structure corresponds to a saddle point of the potential energy surface , there are at least one phonon modes with imaginary frequencies , and one can follow these modes to end up at one or more lower - energy , dynamically stable structures @xcite .",
    "in this section , we examine two examples of using the calculated free energy for some discussions of the thermodynamic stability of crystals .      at a given temperature / pressure condition , the lowest gibbs free energy structure of a certain crystal",
    "is considered to be thermodynamically stable .",
    "consequently , the structural phase transitions of a crystal may be traced by examining the gibbs free energy calculated for its possible structures @xcite . here , we limit at @xmath71 , thus the helmholtz free energy @xmath22 will be used to estimate the critical temperature @xmath72 of the phase transitions of some representative crystals .    .low- and high - temperature phases of some crystalline materials examined in this work . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     three crystalline solids which are used for this demonstration ,",
    "are summarized in table [ table : struct ] . both zirconia zro@xmath0 and hafnia hfo@xmath0 are known@xcite to transform from a monoclinic @xmath73 structure at low temperatures to a tetragonal @xmath74 structure at higher temperatures .",
    "these phase transitions occur at @xmath75k and @xmath76k for zirconia and hafnia , respectively .",
    "likewise , potassium borohydride kbh@xmath1 crystallizes in a tetragonal @xmath74 structure below @xmath77 k while adopting a cubic @xmath78 structure above this point @xcite .",
    "the helmholtz free energy @xmath22 has been calculated for all of these structural phases , using vasp and phonopy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe ] we show the free energy of the high - temperature ( high-@xmath28 ) structure of each crystal with respect to that of the low - temperature ( low-@xmath28 ) structure .",
    "clearly , the low-@xmath28 and high-@xmath28 structures of zirconia , hafnia , and potassium borohydride are correctly described by the calculations .",
    "the phase transitions of zirconia and hafnia are predicted to be @xmath79k and @xmath80 k @xcite , which are in relatively good agreements with the known facts . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical temperature predicted for potassium borohydride is about @xmath81 k , which is considerably higher than the correct value ( a similar observation was also reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "phases of zro@xmath0 , hfo@xmath0 and kbh@xmath1 with respect to their low-@xmath28 phases .",
    "details on these phases can be found in table [ table : struct].,width=321 ]    the discrepancy observed for @xmath72 of potassium borohydride may be understandable , given that the lattice - dynamics approach for calculating @xmath19 assumes a series of approximations and simplifications . moreover , as mentioned above , complex borohydrides like kbh@xmath1 are highly dynamical , i.e. , the bh@xmath1 groups may jump and/or rotate @xcite .",
    "such the motions can not be captured by the harmonic approximation , which assumes small displacements .",
    "next , the lattice - dynamics approach , as described in this contribution , is basically an extrapolation procedure , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath56 of the high-@xmath28 cubic @xmath78 phase , which exists at @xmath82k , are calculated at @xmath83k and then , the relevant energetic quantity , i.e. , @xmath22 , is extrapolated back to non - zero temperatures using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fvib ] ) . finally , the energy difference between the high-@xmath28 and low-@xmath28 phases of potassium borohydride is very small ( @xmath84 mev / atom , more than one order smaller than those of zirconia and hafnia ) , suggesting that this numerical scheme may still not be adequate for a marginal case like kbh@xmath1 .      for another demonstration",
    ", we consider a chemical reaction of which the reactants and products are all solids @xcite @xmath85 this is the synthesis route of @xmath86 , as reported in refs .",
    "however , the stability of @xmath86 is still in a debate , and a the presence of pure @xmath86 is not conclusive . while the structure of the synthesized @xmath86 samples has yet been resolved , a number of low - energy structures have been proposed via dft calculations @xcite . as one of the simple tests that may be performed on these hypothetical structures , the free energy change @xmath87 of the reaction ( [ eq : znbh4 ] ) can be calculated .",
    "a positive value of @xmath87 suggests that the examined structure of @xmath86 is unstable , while a negative value of @xmath87 may be a supporting evidence for @xmath86 .     of reaction ( [ eq : znbh4]).,width=321 ]",
    "we show in fig .",
    "( [ fig : zn ] ) the free energy change @xmath87 calculated for the reaction ( [ eq : znbh4 ] ) , using the currently known most - stable structures of the crystals involving .",
    "they are the @xmath88 structure of @xmath86 @xcite , the @xmath74 structure of nabh@xmath1 @xcite , the @xmath78 structure of nacl , and the @xmath89 structure of @xmath90zncl@xmath0 @xcite . a conclusion which may be drawn from fig .",
    "( [ fig : zn ] ) is that up to @xmath91 k , the formation of @xmath86 according to the reaction ( [ eq : znbh4 ] ) is energetically permissible .",
    "it is however worth noting that the thermodynamic stability of @xmath86 should be examined with respect to all the possible formation / decomposition chemical reactions , the practice which is well beyond the scope of this contribution .",
    "in summary , gibbs and helmholtz free energies of crystals may be estimated by lattice dynamics within the harmonic approximation at the level of density functional theory .",
    "this computational scheme produces reasonable results for many crystals but there are also other solids with which this approach should be used with great cautions .",
    "although some treatments for the anharmonic terms of the free energies are also currently available , they should also be material - dependent in the similar fashion with this scheme .",
