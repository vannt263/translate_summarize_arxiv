    "in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at top rhic and the lhc energies , a hot and dense matter  the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) has been created . during its expansion ,",
    "the qgp fireball quickly cools down , which then undergos the phase transition and produces a large amount of hadrons .",
    "these hadrons subsequently experience frequent inelastic and elastic collisions during the hadronic evolution . with the termination of inelastic and elastic collisions ,",
    "the evolving system reach the chemical and thermal freeze - out , respectively .    traditionally , the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath2 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath3 are extracted from the particle yields of various hadrons using the statistical model  @xcite , which gives a uniform @xmath2 and @xmath3 for all hadrons species .",
    "similarly , pure hydrodynamic simulations implement a uniform thermal freeze - out temperature to construct the freeze - out hyper - surface , which decouples various hadrons from the bulk matter  @xcite .",
    "microscopically , the related inelastic and elastic scattering channels are different for each hadron species . as a result ,",
    "the chemical and thermal freeze - out procedures are very possibly hadron - species dependent . in this proceeding",

    "our calculations implement vishnu hybrid model  @xcite that combines ( 2 + 1)-d relativistic viscous hydrodynamics ( vish2 + 1 )  @xcite for the qgp fluid expansion with a microscopic hadronic transport model ( urqmd )  @xcite for the hadron resonance gas evolution .",
    "the hydrodynamic calculations input the equation of state ( eos ) s95p - pce  @xcite with the transition to urqmd at a constant temperature of 165 mev . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we input smooth initial conditions generated from the mc - kln model  @xcite , where the normalization factor of the initial entropy density profiles is tuned to reproduce the multiplicity of all charged hadrons in the most central pb+pb collisions  @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations start at @xmath10 with the specific shear viscosity @xmath11 set to 0.16 , and the bulk viscosity set to zero  @xcite .",
    "the chemical and thermal freeze - out of the evolving system are respectively related to the terminations of inelastic and elastic collisions .",

    ", we will briefly summarize our recent investigations on the chemical and thermal freeze - out of various hadron species at the lhc , based on dynamical simulations from vishnu hybrid model .",
    "figure  1 presents the vishnu calculations of the particle yields for @xmath12 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 in the most central pb+pb collisions , which nicely fit the corresponding experimental data measured by alice .",
    "it was found that the baryon and anti - baryon ( @xmath13-@xmath14 ) annihilations during the hadronic evolution reduce the proton and anti - proton ( @xmath15 ) yields by @xmath16 , largely improving the description of the @xmath15 data  @xcite .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite also showed that vishnu hybrid model also nicely fit the multiplicities , @xmath17 spectra and differential elliptic flow of @xmath12 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 at various centrality bins . with the good descriptions of these related soft hadron data , it is meaningful to further investigate the chemical and thermal freeze - out procedures of various hadrons at the lhc .     for @xmath12 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 during the urqmd expansion of vishnu . here ,",

    "this reveals that @xmath0 and @xmath1 experience early chemical freeze - out after the hadronazition .",
    "in contrast , the yields of @xmath5 slowly decreases during the hadronic evolution especially for the case with @xmath20-@xmath14 annihilations , indicating later chemical freeze - out of protons . on the production of @xmath6 and @xmath4 , the @xmath20-@xmath14 annihilations almost balance with other inelastic collision channels . as a result ,",
    "the yields of @xmath6 and @xmath4 only slightly change during the hadronic evolution with @xmath20-@xmath14 annihilations  @xcite .",
    "the right panels of fig .  1 presents the changing rates of the particle yields of these identified hadrons . for the simulations without @xmath20-@xmath14 annihilations , the changing rates for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 show wide peaks along the time axis , illustrating that the associated inelastic collisions are still frequent after 10 - 20 @xmath21 . due to small hadronic cross sections , multi - strange hadrons @xmath0 and @xmath1 rarely interact with other hadrons . while , the annihilations with their own anti - particles lead to wide peaks of the changing rates for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in panel ( h ) , which delay their chemical freeze - out , when compared with the case without @xmath20-@xmath14 annihilations .",
    "however , these multi - strange hadrons still experience earlier chemical freeze - out in the full vishnu simulations compared with other identified hadrons  @xcite .",

    "the peaks of their thermal freeze - out time distributions are located around 10 @xmath21 . while the peaks of @xmath5 and @xmath6 distributions are around 20 - 30 @xmath21 .",
    "due to a large amount of hadronic scatterings during the late urqmd evolution , the thermal freeze - out time distributions of @xmath12 and @xmath4 widely spread along the time axis .",
    "3 thus illustrates that thermal freeze - out procedures are hadron species dependent .",
