    "we first briefly describe the natural time analysis of seismicity @xcite . in a time series comprising @xmath5 earthquakes",
    ", the natural time @xmath6 serves as an index for the occurrence of the @xmath7-th earthquake . in natural time analysis",
    "the pair @xmath8 is studied , where @xmath9 is the energy released during the @xmath7-th earthquake of magnitude @xmath10 .",
    "alternatively , one may study the pair @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the normalized energy released during the @xmath7-th earthquake , and @xmath9 -and hence @xmath13- is estimated through the relation @xcite @xmath14 .",
    "the variance of @xmath1 weighted for @xmath13 , designated by @xmath4 , is given by @xcite @xmath15 this quantity can be also considered as an order parameter for seismicity@xcite .    in order to study the fluctuations of @xmath4",
    ", we apply the following procedure @xcite . taking an excerpt of a seismic catalog comprising @xmath16 successive events ,",
    "we start from the first eq and calculate the first 35 @xmath4 values for 6 to 40 consecutive eqs ( cf . the upper limit of this number does not markedly influence the results @xcite ) .",
    "then we proceed to the second eq , and calculate again 35 values of @xmath4 using the 7@xmath17 to the 41@xmath18 event .",
    "scanning , event by event , the whole excerpt of @xmath19 earthquakes , we calculate the average value @xmath20 and the standard deviation @xmath21 of the @xmath4 values .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is defined@xcite as the variability @xmath23 of @xmath4 for this excerpt of length @xmath19 .",
    "usually we are interested on what happens to the @xmath23 value until just before the occurrence of each eq , @xmath24 , in the seismic catalog . to achieve this goal",
    ", we calculate first the @xmath4 values using the _ previous _ 6 to 40 ( or 6 to @xmath19)@xcite consecutive eqs .",
    "these 35 @xmath4 values are associated with the eq @xmath24 , but we clarify that the eq @xmath24 has _ not _ been employed for their calculation .",
    "the @xmath23 value -corresponding to the eq @xmath24- for a natural time window length @xmath19 is computed using all the ( @xmath25 ) @xmath4 values associated with the eqs @xmath26 to @xmath24 .",
    "the resulting value is denoted by @xmath27 , where the subscript @xmath19 shows the natural time window length , and the corresponding minimum is designated by @xmath28 .",
    "we now summarize a few important points that emerged in our earlier studies@xcite , reviewed also in chapter 6 of ref . , when analyzing in natural time the _ long term",
    "_ seismicity in wide areas . by using a natural time window comprising 6 to 40 consecutive events sliding through an earthquake catalog ,",
    "the computed @xmath4 values lead to the construction of the probability density function ( pdf ) p(@xmath4 ) of a wide area .",
    "the scaled distribution @xmath29 p(@xmath4 ) plotted versus ( @xmath30 ) of this area collapses on the same curve with the ones deduced from different wide areas .",
    "for example , the curve obtained from the area @xmath31 in japan using the jma catalog , and the area @xmath32 in california using the southern california earthquake catalog ( scec ) @xcite .",
    "it has been also found that this _",
    "universal _ curve of long term seismicity exhibits strikingly similar features with the corresponding scaled distribution curves of the order parameter fluctuations in other -nonequilibrium or equilibrium- critical systems@xcite including the data@xcite we analyzed@xcite for the case of self organized criticality@xcite .",
    "this similarity was focused on the existence of a common `` exponential tail '' ( which has in fact a double exponential form ) reflecting non - gaussian ( large , but rare ) fluctuations .",
    "in this study we present examples of major eqs that occurred in california .",
    "we used the united states geological survey northern california seismic network catalog available from the northern california earthquake data center , at the http address : www.ncedc.org/ncedc/catalog-search.html , hereafter called ncedc .",
    "the earthquake magnitudes reported in this catalog are hereafter labelled with @xmath0 .",
    "we considered all earthquakes with @xmath33 reported by ncedc , within the area @xmath34 ( the green rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we have on average @xmath35 eqs per month since 31832 earthquakes occurred for the 25 year period from 1 january 1979 to 1 january 2004 .    following ref . , we focus hereafter on the natural time window length @xmath36300 , which is compatible with the fact that the lead time of ses activities is around a few months ( i.e. , from 21 days to an upper limit of around 5 months , e.g. , see ref . ) . by analyzing in natural time the aforementioned ncedc data , we recently identified @xcite , for @xmath19=300 events , the dates of the minima @xmath28 as being 1 to 5 months before four out of the five mainshocks with @xmath37 that occurred within the wide area @xmath38 during the 25 year period 1 january 1979 to 1 january 2004 in california .",
    "for the two examples of the @xmath07.4 landers eq on 28 june 1992 and the @xmath07.0 hector mine eq on 16 october 1999 that will be treated below , the dates of the precursory minima @xmath39 were reported to be 28 january 1992 and 14 may 1999 , respectively .",
    "briefly , the method proposed in based on the following main aspect : we argue that a minimum should be observed almost simultaneously in the order parameter fluctuations of the seismicity within _ both _ the wide area and the epicentral area of the impending mainshock .",
    "this stems from our findings in ref . where we identified the appearance of a @xmath28 ( at scales @xmath19=100 to @xmath19=400 ) in the seismicity within the wide area @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath40 , in japan around the date ( i.e. , on 26 april 2000 ) of the initiation of the ses activity recorded@xcite at niijima island -in the vicinity of which a major seismic swarm started 2 months later with a @xmath06.5 eq on 1 july 2000 .",
    "moreover , it was found that in areas surrounding niijima island the variability @xmath23 of the seismicity exhibited a minimum almost at the _ same _ date , i.e. , around 26 april .",
    "hence , in the light of the above findings , the method to estimate the epicentral area of an impending mainshock -when no information for the recording of an ses activity is available- should consist of the following steps :    first step : we start the investigation from the natural time analysis of the seismicity in a wide area , for example @xmath41 ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) in california . by considering a sliding natural time window comprising a number of events that would occur in a few months ( e.g. ,",
    "we may adopt , as in ref . , @xmath19=300 events for the aforementioned wide area in california ) , we search for a minimum in the @xmath23 variability .    7.0 hector mine eq in california on 16 october 1999 .",
    "( * a * ) the variability @xmath23 of the seismicity versus the conventional time for a natural time window length @xmath19 comprising a number of events that would occur in three months : the thick black curve minimizing on 14 may 1999 corresponds to the wide area @xmath41 .",
    "the other eight curves correspond to those areas -out of the 38 encircled ones in fig .",
    "[ fig1]- resulting in @xmath23 minima which occur at dates close to that of the @xmath43 minimum of the wide area .",
    "these dates for the lower three minima are marked in ( * b * ) and for the remaining five minima in ( * c * ) .",
    "( * b * ) : after discarding the red curve ( see the text ) , the cyan curve exhibits the lowest minimum on 21 may 1999 .",
    "it corresponds to the area @xmath44 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by the cyan rectangle along with the hector mine eq epicenter marked with the neighboring red triangle ( the smaller ) .",
    "the eqs with @xmath45 ( right scale ) are shown with vertical bars ending at solid circles . ]",
    "second step : we investigate whether this minimum is a precursory one by examining whether it obeys the criteria mentioned in ref . .",
    "this should necessarily include the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa)@xcite in order to investigate temporal correlations in the earthquake magnitude time series at the same natural time window length scale as the one mentioned above ( cf . it has been shown @xcite that @xmath23 captures the correlations between the events ) .",
    "dfa has become the standard method when studying long - range correlated time series and can also be applied to real world non - stationary signals @xcite .",
    "third step : we search for the epicentral area of the impending mainshock by using an area window of an appreciably smaller size , e.g. , @xmath46 for the cases studied in california , sliding ( with steps of @xmath47 in longitude and/or @xmath47 in latitude , see the green plus symbols in fig . [ fig1 ] ) through the wide area . for each location of the sliding area window , we repeat the analysis as in the wide area in order to determine the date of @xmath28 . note that , if in the aforementioned wide area of california ( in which , as mentioned , occur on average 100 events / month ) we used @xmath19=300 events , we should consider as @xmath19 in each location of the sliding area window the corresponding number of the events that would occur on average within three months .",
    "this reflects that we can not select an area window of arbitrarily smaller size in view of the following limitation : in order to identify the date of the occurrence of the minimum of @xmath23 in an area window size with an uncertainty of around a few days , we must have at least on the average 2 events per week , i.e. , at least 24 events for an almost three month period ( 12 weeks ) . among these locations of the sliding area window",
    "investigated , we select the one(s ) which led to a @xmath28 date which almost coincides with the date at which the @xmath39 value was observed in the wide area . in practice",
    ", the former date differs from the latter usually by no more than a few days up to around 10 days , or so .",
    "this way we usually find an area surrounding the future epicenter , as it results from the examples presented in the following two sections , which refer to major eqs that occurred in california .",
    "since a major eq occurs , as mentioned , 1 to 5 months after the appearance of @xmath39 in the wide area @xcite , the applicability of the method proposed here becomes more clear when a single major mainshock occurs within a five month period .",
    "such an example , is the case of the @xmath07.0 hector mine eq in california in 1999 .",
    "furthermore , in a later section , we shall present a case in which two major mainshocks occurred inside the wide area within 5 months .",
    "this is the case of the @xmath07.4 landers eq on 28 june 1992 that was preceded by the @xmath06.7 ( @xmath487.1 , e.g. see ref . )",
    "cape mendocino eq on 25 april 1992 . as we shall see later",
    ", it is strikingly interesting that in the latter case the method identifies two different epicentral areas as it should .",
    "we clarify that in the next two sections , we solely focus on the third step of the method since the first two steps -referring to the identification in the wide area of the dates of the minima @xmath39 for major eqs in california and their distinction from the non precursory minima- have been already accomplished , as mentioned , in ref . .",
    "to summarize : for the analysis of the examples presented below for california , we used the wide area @xmath38 as in ref.@xcite , and a sliding area window size @xmath46 ( with step @xmath47 ) resulting in 156 areas ( see the plus symbols in fig . [ fig1 ] ) out of which 38 areas ( encircled in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) had at least 24 events on average per three months .",
    "hence , the investigation of the examples below in california was made by analyzing the seismic data occurring in these 38 areas .",
    "the thick black curve in fig . [ fig2]a depicts the variability @xmath23 versus the conventional time when a natural time window length @xmath19=300 events is sliding through the wide area @xmath38 .",
    "a clear minimum of @xmath23 is observed on 14 may 1999 , as marked in the figure .",
    "the subsequent analysis of the 38 areas -out of the 156 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1]- resulting from the locations of the sliding window of size @xmath46 lead to 38 curves . eight of these curves , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , were identified to exhibit a @xmath23 minimum with dates within 10 days , or so , from the aforementioned date on 14 may 1999 obtained from the wide area .",
    "these dates are now marked , for reader s convenience , in two separate panels of this figure : in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b -for the three lowest minima observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a- and in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c for the minima of the remaining five curves",
    ". a closer inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig2]b shows that the red curve in the bottom ( that is obtained from the area @xmath51 ) has a plateau extending from 8 may until 5 june which in fact comes from the absence of the occurrence of any event in the area during this almost one month period .",
    "thus , this curve should be discarded from further analysis since we can not derive a definite conclusion on the existence or not of a minimum close to the aforementioned date 14 may 1999 . between the remaining two curves ,",
    "the cyan has a minimum which is somewhat lower and occurs on 21 may 1999 .",
    "it corresponds to the area @xmath44 depicted with the cyan rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] along with the epicenter of the hector mine eq ( the smaller red triangle ) lying at @xmath49n @xmath50w .",
    "the epicenter is located just at the eastern edge of the area , see the cyan rectangle in fig .",
    "the other curve , i.e. , the magenta in fig.[fig2]b , corresponds to the area @xmath52 , see the magenta rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which is only @xmath53 far from the hector mine eq epicenter . as for the five curves in fig.[fig2]c they correspond to the areas",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 lying at various distances ( roughly between @xmath47 and @xmath59 ) from the hector mine eq epicenter .",
    "none of these areas , is adjacent to the epicenter as the aforementioned one @xmath60 which corresponds to the cyan curve exhibiting the lowest @xmath23 minimum in figs . [ fig2]a , b .",
    "thus , in short , the cyan curve exhibiting a @xmath23 minimum on 21 may , i.e. , around a week later from that ( 14 may ) identified in the wide area ( thick black curve ) , which happens to be the lowest one among the other curves showing also minima at neighboring dates , corresponds to an area whose eastern edge lies just at the hector mine eq epicenter .",
    "this eq , which is the largest moment magnitude ( @xmath63 ) eq that occurred in california since 1992 , has been preceded by the @xmath06.7 ( @xmath487.1 ) cape mendocino eq on 25 april 1992 with an epicenter at @xmath64n @xmath65w ( followed by two strong @xmath06.45 and @xmath06.6 aftershocks on 26 april 1992 ) .",
    "hence , landers eq and cape mendocino eq occurred within almost 3 months being less than the maximum lead time between @xmath39 and the subsequent eq which is around 5 months @xcite .",
    "the complexity of this case might be the origin of the following fact : the variability of the seismicity versus the conventional time in the wide area @xmath38 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with a thick black curve , although exhibited its lowest value on 28 january 1992 ( marked in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , its minimum is in fact very broad ( like a plateau ) lasting for about 4 weeks , i.e. , from 18 january to around 20 february , 1992 .",
    "this must be carefully considered when the area window of @xmath46 is sliding ( with step @xmath47 ) through the aforementioned wide area .",
    "we found that , among the 38 areas studied , eight of them led to @xmath23 minima with dates from 2 february to 19 february 1992 , thus lying within the broad range mentioned above for the @xmath23 minimum of the wide area .",
    "the eight curves corresponding to these areas are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a and can be classified into two types , which are depicted separately in figs .",
    "[ fig3]b and [ fig3]c where we also mark the date of the minimum in each curve .",
    "first , in three of these curves shown with magenta squares , black triangles and cyan circles , which correspond to the areas @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath44 , a very sharp minimum appears on 19 february 1999 , see fig .",
    "an inspection of these three areas shows that the epicenter of landers eq in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( large red triangle ) lies inside the latter area ( depicted with a cyan rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , @xmath47 to the east of the first area and around @xmath68 to the southeast of the second area .",
    "second , the remaining five curves , see fig .",
    "[ fig3]c , shown in orange circles , blue squares , red crosses , thin black line and green asterisks ( starting from the curve with the lowest @xmath23 minimum ) , exhibit non - sharp minima on the following dates 2 , 2 , 2 , 16 and 17 february , 1992 , and correspond to the following five areas : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the first area is depicted with the orange rectangle in fig.[fig1 ] , where we see that the epicenter of the cape mendocino eq marked by a red triangle -inside the orange rectangle- along with the neighboring two smaller red triangles showing its two aftershocks@xcite , lies inside it ( cf .",
    "the brown rectangle depicted in fig , [ fig1 ] also results as a candidate epicentral area for the cape mendocino eq upon considering a reasonable experimental error in the determination of the magnitudes .",
    "concerning the other areas , we find that the cape mendocino epicenter lies @xmath74 to the west of the second area , @xmath74 to the north from the third and the fourth , and around @xmath75 to the nw of the fifth area",
    ".    let us summarize : we found that eight curves minimize at dates within the broad minimum ( 18 january - 20 february ) exhibiting by the thick black curve corresponding to the wide area",
    ". among these curves , three minimize on 19 february 1992 and five at earlier dates .",
    "the former three curves correspond to areas related with landers eq since one of them is surrounding its epicenter , and the other two are neighboring areas , i.e. , @xmath47 and @xmath68 far from the epicenter .",
    "the remaining five curves correspond to areas related with the cape mendocino eq since one of them ( exhibiting the lowest minimum ) is surrounding its epicenter , and the other four lie in its vicinity .",
    "the prediction of the epicenter of an impending mainshock can be made on the basis of the ses physical properties , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "this of course has two prerequisites : first , that geoelectrical data are available and second , that we know from earlier experience the selectivity map @xcite of the measuring station at which the ses under investigation appeared .",
    "the method proposed here can not be falsely considered as replacing that followed by means of ses since it does not improve its accuracy , which is of the order of 100 km , but it has the privilege that can be applied even in the lack of geoelectrical data .    in conclusion",
    ", here we proposed a method to estimate the epicentral area of an impending mainshock based on a precursory minimum observed in the fluctuations of the order parameter of seismicity .",
    "this has been successfully applied to mainshocks in california including the landers eq on 28 june 1992 , which is the largest earthquake that occurred in california during the last three decades .",
    "these results are found to be robust when repeating 100 trials upon considering a reasonable experimental error in the magnitude measurements of the earthquakes in the seismic catalog used .",
    "all the seismic data taken from ncedc have been analyzed in natural time .",
    "the seismic moment @xmath76 , which is proportional to the energy release during an earthquake and hence to the quantity @xmath9 used in natural time analysis , is calculated @xcite from the relation @xmath77const ."
