    "recently there has been a growing interest in thermodynamics @xcite and especially fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities of nano - sized electronic systems @xcite . while in macroscopic systems , fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities are usually negligible , in nanoscale systems they can have a large effect on the transport properties of the system @xcite .",
    "another source of interest to fluctuations is the possibility to use them to realize various types of szilard engine or maxwell s demon type @xcite machines in nanosystems .    in the field of electronic quantum transport ,",
    "the system under consideration often consists of the actual device which we want to model and some leads which are coupled to the device and act as an environment .",
    "the energy and charge transport between the leads and the system is stochastic ( by the nature of quantum mechanics ) which causes fluctuations in the state of the system .",
    "we present here a derivation for the langevin equation for the energy of an island connected to two leads in a very general setting . as an example",

    ", the fact that the tunneling rates have a strong peak at the edge of the superconducting gap leads to an approximate equivalence between the number of quasiparticle excitations and the energy on the island .    .",
    "the solid lines are the corresponding distributions calculated from the fokker - planck distribution and substituting for the quasiparticle number an effective one from the bcs equilibrium relation between the quasiparticle number and the temperature . blue , red and green curves are for @xmath0 , respectively .",

    "in the full counting statistics formalism , the expectation values of observables and their moments ( noise , etc . ) are calculated from a generating function .",
    "the generating function is often written in the form ( here and below , @xmath1 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an effective action describing the system and @xmath4 is the counting field .",
    "the effective action can often be derived from the microscopic theory by integrating out the microscopic degrees of freedom from the microscopic action of the system .",
    "we consider a system described by the tunneling hamiltonian of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the hamiltonians describing two independent systems and @xmath8 is the tunneling hamiltonian that parametrizes the interaction between them via tunneling matrix elements @xmath9 , of a particle on state @xmath10 tunneling between the systems . in this case",

    "the two connector actions describe the left and the right contacts . in interacting systems",
    ", the partition function often contains also functional integrals over some fields that are the result of hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the interactions .",
    "below we assume that they are evaluated using the saddle point approximation .",

    "the considerations could also be generalized to higher - order processes in @xmath34 @xcite .",

    ", we neglect the charge counting field @xmath4 .",
    "expanding the integrand in the partition function in the powers of @xmath23 gives @xmath35 \\exp\\bigg[-\\int dt \\xi(t ) \\\\ & \\times \\bigg ( \\dot{e } - \\sum_k \\epsilon_k \\delta(t - t_k ) + \\sum_j \\epsilon'_j \\delta(t - t'_j)\\bigg)\\bigg ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the exponential term with the sum over the delta functions follows from the relation @xmath36 this form allows us to carry out the functional integration over the counting field @xmath16 .",
    "this results in a delta function that indicates that only the paths that satisfy the equation @xmath37 contribute to the partition function .",
    "the energy of the island is thus changed in discrete steps by particles tunneling at times @xmath38 with energies @xmath39 .",
    "the distribution of the times and energies of these tunneling events are given by the weighting factor in the partition function .",
    "in this case they are poisson distributed .      from eq . describing discrete tunneling events we can move to a continuum description as follows .",
    "let us consider the total energy transferred to the island during some long time interval of length @xmath40 .",
    "let us further divide this time to shorter time intervals @xmath41 .",
    "the rate of change of the energy during this longer time interval @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 here @xmath44 is a random variable that gives the number of @xmath26 or @xmath27 tunneling events during the time interval @xmath45 $ ] and energy interval @xmath46 $ ] . as shown above ,",
    "the number of events in this two - dimensional interval is poisson distributed with mean and variance of @xmath47 .",
    "now we define a new random variable as @xmath48 if we can assume that the tunneling events at different times are independent of each other , the central limit theorem tells us that the random variable @xmath49 is normally distributed as @xmath50 where the first argument is the mean and the second argument is the variance .",
    "we have also taken the limit @xmath51 and converted the sum over times to an integral . the total energy transferred during the time interval @xmath52",
    "$ ] becomes a linear combination of normally distributed random variables with coefficients @xmath53 .",
    "a linear combination of normal random variables is also a normal random variable and thus the total energy transferred during the time interval @xmath52 $ ] is given by @xmath54 where we have also approximated the rates in the time integral by constants in time .",
    "the mean and the variance of the distribution are given in terms of the energy current to the island , @xmath55 , and its noise , @xmath56 .",
    "dividing by @xmath42 and separating the random variable to stochastic and deterministic parts , we get the langevin equation for the energy of the island @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a normal random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath59 .    in order to be able to derive eq . , we had to assume that the numbers of tunneling events on the small time intervals are uncorrelated .",
    "since the tunneling probabilities depend on the state of the island and the tunneling events change the state , this assumption is justified only in the limit where the change of the state due to one tunneling event is negligible , i.e. , when there are no effects due to the charging energy , ( i.e. @xmath60 ) , and the energy change of the island due to one tunneling event is small compared to the total energy of the island . for a quantum dot with level spacing @xmath61",
    ", the assumption is also broken because the tunneling of one particle to the island heavily affects subsequent tunneling events due to the pauli exclusion princple .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "can also be derived directly from the action by expanding it to the second order in @xmath16 and then carrying out functional integration over @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "then the assumption of uncorrelated tunneling events means that we can disregard terms of higher order than @xmath62 .",
    "for a superconducting island there are several processes that in principle contribute to the state of the island .",
    "the above discussion can be used to take into account the process where single quasiparticles tunnel into or out of the island .",
    "processes of a higher order in the tunneling matrix elements , such as andreev reflection and co - tunneling , can be neglected if we consider only contacts with low transparency .",
    "other processes include quasiparticle scattering from phonons , which can be neglected choosing materials with small electron - phonon coupling constant and limiting the consideration to low temperatures .",
    "one more possible process is the quasiparticle recombination process which also is typically driven by electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the rate for this process is analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for quasiparticles at the gap edge , @xmath63 , the tunneling rate divided by the recombination rate",
    "is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the characteristic recombination time in aluminium and @xmath66 is the tunnel resistance .",
    "the recombination rate can be neglected ( @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "let us consider the case when the energy relaxation time for the quasiparticles on the island is faster than the injection rate . in this case",
    "the quasiparticles on the island can be described by the fermi - dirac distribution with some fluctuating temperature @xmath42 . from the bcs theory ,",
    "the energy of a superconducting island at equilibrium for @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the average level spacing of the island .",
    "in all considerations below , we assume @xmath72 . on the other hand , the energy carried by a single tunneling quasiparticle ( for bias voltage @xmath73 ) is of the order of @xmath74 . in the light of the discussion in the previous section , the criterion for the independence of tunneling events",
    "is thus given by @xmath75 .",
    "this can also be written as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mean quasiparticle number on the island .",
    "we consider this limit first .",
    "furthermore , by assuming that there is no charge imbalance on the island , which is valid for a left - right symmetric setup , we can choose the chemical potential of the island to zero so that the energy transferred to the island coincides with the heat transferred to the island .",
    "it is most convenient to consider the fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities in terms of the probability distribution for the island being in some given state .",
    "the langevin equation with gaussian noise can be related to the probability distribution @xmath78 for having the island at some energy or , equivalently , the probability distribution @xmath79 for the temperature of the island .",
    "this can be solved from the corresponding fokker - planck equation ( for derivation , see @xcite ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the heat capacity of the island .",
    "solving this gives @xmath82 .",
    "\\label{fokkerplanck}\\ ] ] by substituting into the heat current and its noise the tunneling probabilities from eqs . and and analyzing the above expression",
    ", we see that in the limit where the tunneling events are uncorrelated , the last two terms in eq . can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , approximating the heat capacity as a constant and evaluating the heat current and its noise in the first order in @xmath83 , we get @xmath84 .\\ ] ] this is the gaussian distribution , as expected for equilibrium fluctuations @xcite .",
    "what is more interesting is that the distribution keeps the gaussian form ( within the low temperature approximation ) even when the system is biased with voltage @xmath85 . the bias can be taken into account in @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the lambert w - function .",
    "next we consider the superconducting island in the limit where the tunneling events are correlated , i.e. , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . because the tunneling rates are larger than other rates that change the quasiparticle number of the island , the quasiparticle number is a well - defined quantity between the tunneling events and we can consider a master equation approach to calculate the statistics of the quasiparticle number . for now , we stick to the assumption that the quasiparticles can relax to the equilibrium distribution immediately after tunneling .",
    "we return to the validity of this assumption below . as an approximation",
    ", we assume that each tunneling event carries energy @xmath74 .",
    "this approximation can be validated by evaluating the effective action in the lowest order in the temperature in a similar way as in refs .  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the two terms describing the tunneling into and out of the island become proportional to @xmath90 . differentiating this with respect to the counting field",
    ", we find that for example the heat current is given by @xmath74 times the particle current into the island , i.e. each tunneling particle increases or decreases the energy of the island by @xmath74 .",
    "the effect of the tunneling on the state of the island is to change the thermal energy on the island which in turn has a one - to - one correspondence with the temperature of the island .",
    "the temperature after tunneling can be calculated by inverting eq . and substituting for the thermal energy @xmath91 .",
    "using the formalism of the previous section , the langevin equation for the energy of the island becomes @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are poisson distributed with rates @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "written explicitly , the rates read to the lowest order in temperature and in the limit @xmath97 @xmath98 and @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the temperature of the leads , @xmath101 is the fluctuating temperature of the island corresponding to the energy of the island @xmath102 and the chemical potential is given by @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the left and the right leads , respectively . due to our approximation of each particle carrying energy @xmath74 , this can also be interpreted as a langevin equation for the particle number on the island . the corresponding master equation with rates and gives the probability distribution for the quasiparticle number on the island , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : langevinnisin ] .    for a low average @xmath77 ,",
    "the independent tunneling approximation breaks down .",
    "this can be seen in the fact that even in equilibrium the average @xmath77 obtained from eq .",
    "does not equal @xmath105 obtained from the bcs formula .",
    "rather , one has to use the distribution obtained from eq .  .",
    "above we assume the island to be in quasiequilibrium , i.e. that the distribution function of the island can be described by an effective temperature @xmath106 . whether this is a good assumption",
    "is debatable . in the lowest order in temperature ,",
    "we can , however , show that this assumption plays no role , because it gives the same rates as we would get by just assuming that all quasiparticles are distributed close to the gap edge .",
    "we now present an argument to derive the same rates without assuming a thermal distribution on the island .",
    "for tunneling from lead @xmath107 to the island with only a few excited quasiparticles , the rate is only determined by the filling factor in the lead .",
    "this is because for a small number of excitations on the island , the number of available states close to the gap edge is much larger than the number of excitations due to the bcs divergence in the density of states and a small level spacing .",
    "thus the tunneling rate from lead @xmath107 to the island equals @xmath108 which gives eq . in the low - temperature limit . for tunneling from the island to lead @xmath107 ,",
    "the rate is determined by the number of excitations on the island . from the fermi golden rule , assuming that all quasiparticles are located at energy @xmath74 ( and @xmath97 ) , we get @xmath109 this is equivalent to , provided that we can substitute for the particle number an effective temperature defined by the bcs formula .    in the discussion above",
    ", we did not consider the effect of possible fluctuations of the superconducting gap @xmath74 . from the standard bcs gap equation",
    "one can show that the corrections to the zero - temperature gap with @xmath110 particles on energy state @xmath74 are of the order of @xmath111 , which means that they can be neglected . on the other hand",
    "one could imagine that the modifications to the partition function change the gap equation somehow . however , these modifications are proportional to the tunneling rates , which are small compared to the terms appearing in the bcs energy term .",
    "the latter term alone gives the bcs gap equation .",
    "we have shown how the langevin ( or equivalently , the master or fokker - planck ) equation can be derived from the effective action describing particle transport in a setup consisting of a mesoscopic island and two leads .",
    "we show how the langevin - like equation describing discrete tunneling events leads to the traditional langevin equation with continuous transport rate in the limit of uncorrelated tunneling events .",
    "we have also applied the formalism to calculate the temperature and quasiparticle excitation statistics on a superconducting island coupled to two normal metal leads .",
