    "the concept of symmetry plays an important role both in physics and mathematics .",
    "symmetries are described by transformations of the system , which result in the same object after the transformation is carried out .",
    "they are described mathematically by parameter groups of transformations .",
    "their importance ranges from fundamental and theoretical aspects to concrete applications , having profound implications in the dynamical behavior of the systems , and in their basic qualitative properties .",
    "another fundamental notion in physics and mathematics is the one of conservation law .",
    "typical application of conservation laws in the calculus of variations and optimal control is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom , and thus reducing the problems to a lower dimension , facilitating the integration of the differential equations given by the necessary optimality conditions .",
    "emmy noether was the first who proved , in 1918 , that the notions of symmetry and conservation law are connected : when a system exhibits a symmetry , then a conservation law can be obtained .",
    "one of the most important and well known illustration of this deep and rich relation , is given by the conservation of energy in mechanics : the autonomous lagrangian @xmath0 , correspondent to a mechanical system of conservative points , is invariant under time - translations ( time - homogeneity symmetry ) , and to denote the partial derivative of function @xmath1 with respect to its @xmath2-th argument . ]",

    "expression is valid along all the euler - lagrange extremals @xmath4 of an autonomous problem of the calculus of variations .",
    "the conservation law is known in the calculus of variations as the 2nd erdmann necessary condition ; in concrete applications , it gains different interpretations : conservation of energy in mechanics ; income - wealth law in economics ; first law of thermodynamics ; etc .",
    "the literature on noether s theorem is vast , and many extensions of the classical results of emmy noether are now available for the more general setting of optimal control ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "here we remark that in all those results conservation laws always refer to problems with integer derivatives .    nowadays",
    "fractional differentiation plays an important role in various fields : physics ( classic and quantum mechanics , thermodynamics , etc ) , chemistry , biology , economics , engineering , signal and image processing , and control theory @xcite .",
    "its origin goes back three centuries , when in 1695 lhopital and leibniz exchanged some letters about the mathematical meaning of @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "after that , many famous mathematicians , like j.  fourier , n.  h.  abel , j.  liouville , b.  riemann , among others , contributed to the development of the fractional calculus @xcite .",
    "the study of fractional problems of the calculus of variations and respective euler - lagrange type equations is a subject of current strong research .",
    "f.  riewe @xcite obtained a version of the euler - lagrange equations for problems of the calculus of variations with fractional derivatives , that combines the conservative and non - conservative cases . in 2002 o.",
    "agrawal proved a formulation for variational problems with right and left fractional derivatives in the riemann - liouville sense @xcite .",
    "then , these euler - lagrange equations were used by d. baleanu and t. avkar to investigate problems with lagrangians which are linear on the velocities @xcite . in @xcite",
    "fractional problems of the calculus of variations with symmetric fractional derivatives are considered and correspondent euler - lagrange equations obtained , using both lagrangian and hamiltonian formalisms . in all the above mentioned studies , euler - lagrange equations depend on left and right fractional derivatives , even when the problem depend only on one type of them . in @xcite problems depending on symmetric derivatives",
    "are considered for which euler - lagrange equations include only the derivatives that appear in the formulation of the problem . in @xcite",
    "riemann - liouville fractional integral functionals , depending on a parameter @xmath7 but not on fractional - order derivatives of order @xmath7 , are introduced and respective fractional euler - lagrange type equations obtained .",
    "more recently , the authors have used the results of @xcite to generalize the classical noether s theorem for the context of the fractional calculus of variations @xcite . differently from @xcite , where the lagrangian point of view is considered , here",
    "we adopt an hamiltonian point of view .",
    "fractional hamiltonian dynamics is a very recent subject but the list of publications has become already a long one due to many applications in mechanics and physics .",

    ", it follows that the `` total energy '' ( the autonomous hamiltonian ) of a fractional system is not conserved : a new expression appears ( corollary  [ cor : mainresult ] ) which also depends on the fractional - order of differentiation , the adjoint variable , and the fractional derivative of the state trajectory .",
