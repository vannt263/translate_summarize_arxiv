    "[ sec : intro ]    broad emission lines in the optical and uv bands are prominent features in many active galactic nuclei ( agn ) spectra .",
    "the unified model of agns @xcite assumes that broad emission lines seen in agns are generated in a zone called the broad line region ( blr ) located between a thick dusty torus and the central black hole ( bh ) , in a region close to the accretion disk plane @xcite . even though there are still some open problems regarding the physics and the geometry of the blr ( see gaskell 2009 for a review ) recent results seem to converge toward a scenario where the blr is made of optically thick dusty clouds rotating around the bh in a roughly keplerian fashion with the addition of some local turbulence ( done & krolik 1996 , bottorff et al .",

    "emission line reverberation mapping studies ( kaspi et al . 2000 , peterson et al .",

    "2009 ) show a tight relation between the h@xmath0 effective blr radius and the monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100  : @xmath3 although the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation is well established and even used in an attempt to constrain cosmology ( watson et al .",
    "2011 ) there is still an ongoing debate regarding its origin .",
    "some of the proposed models for the blr formation ( elvis 2000 , elitzur 2008 ) imply some kind of outflow from the disk that is either driven by radiation pressure ( chiang & murray 1996 ) or by the local magnetic field ( blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "+ recently , czerny & hryniewicz ( 2011 ) ( hereafter ch ) proposed a simple formation mechanism for the blr that naturally accounts for most of the observed properties of the blr ( e.g. the @xmath6 relation , the observed turbulence in cloud motions and the universality of the @xmath6 relation among narrow - line and non - narrow - line seyferts 1 ) .",
    "this `` failed disk wind '' scenario predicts that the blr is made by dusty clouds driven above the accretion disk plane by radiation pressure , at radii where the underlying accretion disk is cooler than the dust sublimation temperature ( @xmath7 1000 k ) .",
    "when the clouds rise at a sufficient height above the disk plane , the intense ionising radiation makes the dust sublimate . as a consequence , the clouds loose radiation pressure support and",
    "fall back on the disk plane .",
    "the mix of rising and falling clouds generates a kind of boiling motion .",
    "this hypothesis effectively imposes a minimum radius to the inner edge of the blr that is determined by the radius where the accretion disk has @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we check the consistency between independent optical continuum ( disk ) and h@xmath0 ( blr ) reverberation mapping measurements for a sample of 11 agns . in section 2",

    "our sample consists of 11 bright agn for which there are both disk ( cackett , horne & winkler 2007 ) and h@xmath0 ( bentz et .",
    "al 2009 ) reverberation mapping measurements ( see table 1 ) .",
    "our sample consists mostly of type 1 seyfert galaxies , and spans a range of redshift between @xmath90.002 and @xmath90.06 . for the disk reverberation we use results from cackett , horne & winkler ( 2007 ) where the authors measured time delays for a sample of 14 agn observed in optical bvri bands by sergeev et al .",
    "the authors fit a reddened thin accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) to the variable component of their light and obtain optical continuum time delays by cross - correlation analysis of the light curves . for the h@xmath0 reverberation we use results from bentz et .",

    "1 shows the data points and error bars from table  1 transformed onto logarithmic scales .",
    "when asymmetric error bars are given for @xmath23 , we use their geometric mean .",
    "a correlation is evident in fig .  1 , and the slope can be judged by eye to be close to the theoretical slope of @xmath28 , as indicated by the dashed curves for three disk temperatures . in fig 1",
    "we fit a 2-parameter linear relationship between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , accounting for the error bars on both axes .",
    "as shown in fig  1 , we find a best - fit slope of @xmath31 . as",
    "this is only @xmath32 steeper than the theoretical slope @xmath28 , we conclude that the data are consistent with the theory .",
    "the reduced @xmath33 ( 3.81 with 9 degrees of freedom ) indicates a larger scatter among the data points than can be accounted for by the observational errors .",
    "thus if the error bars are reliable , our fits provide some evidence that the disk temperature at the h@xmath0 radius varies from object to object . to quantify the object - to - object distribution of disk temperatures at the h@xmath0 radius , we define a 2-parameter model with centroid temperature @xmath34 and a temperature dispersion @xmath35 .",
    "our maximum likelihood fit , shown in fig .",
    "2 , gives @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the reduced @xmath38 is now 1 , compatible with the scatter by virtue of the intrinsic dispersion .",
    "the parameters are well enough defined that the posterior distribution is gaussian ( lower panel of fig.2 ) .",
    "our results indicate that the accretion disk temperature at the h@xmath0 radius is @xmath39 k which is quite close to typical dust sublimation temperatures .",
    "this value is @xmath40 700 k higher than that obtained by ch ( 994 @xmath2 74 k ) .",
    "this difference can be largely accounted for by the differences in the assumed h@xmath19 reprocessing geometry between our and ch work .",
    "the time delay at radius r is @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the inclination to the line of sight and @xmath43 the azimuthal angle .",
    "ch assumes a mean blr inclination of @xmath42=39.2@xmath44 and that the h@xmath19 emission arises primarly from the part of the blr farthest away from the observer such that @xmath45 1 . with these assumptions the time delay increases by a factor @xmath46 .",
    "we assume instead that the h@xmath19 response is roughly uniformly distributed in azimuth such that @xmath47= 0 .",
    "considering the @xmath48 relation , one finds that our temperature is @xmath49= 1.44 times higher than in the case of emission coming from the farthest side of the blr . correcting by this factor",
    "yield a temperature centroid of @xmath50 k which is much closer to ch value .",
    "the intrinsic temperature scatter of @xmath37 is not surprising , considering that h@xmath0 delays and @xmath21 measurements are not simultaneous and thus do not correspond to the same disk luminosity .",
    "we have shown that _",
    "independent _ disk and h@xmath0 reverberation mapping measurements are compatible with a universal disk temperature at the h@xmath0 radius of @xmath1 1670 @xmath2 231 k which is close to typical dust sublimation temperatures .",
    "our results are therefore compatible with the failed disk wind scenario for the origin of the blr proposed by czerny & hryniewicz ( 2011 ) . in this framework",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath5 scaling relation can be interpreted as a consequence of the accretion disk luminosity - radius scaling explored in cackett , horne & winkler ( 2007 ) and the existence of a universal dust sublimation temperature among agn ."
