    "3 , the three - dimensional graphs for one - tangles and @xmath0-tangles are given as a function of decoherence parameter , @xmath59 and acceleration @xmath60 for phase damping and phase flip channels .",
    "it is shown that different environments affect the entanglement of the tripartite system differently .",
    "it is also seen that in the case of the phase flip channel , esd behavior becomes independent of the acceleration .",
    "however , the sudden death of entanglement can not be avoided for a phase flip noise around 50% decoherence .",
    "furthermore , entanglement dies out more quickly compared to the phase damping channel for a lower level of decoherence in the case of phase flip noise .",
    "the sudden birth and non - vanishing behavior of the one - tangles @xmath68-tangle at infinite acceleration is an interesting result .",
    "since rindler spacetime is similar to schwarzschild spacetime , it enables one to conjecture that multipartite entanglement does not vanish even if one party falls into the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "hence , some quantum information processing , for example , teleportation , [ 38 ] can be performed within and outside the black hole .    in summary ,",
    "environmental effects on tripartite entanglement in non - inertial frames is investigated by considering a maximally entangled ghz state shared between three partners .",
    "it is assumed that the two partners are in accelerated frames moving with same uniform acceleration . in order to investigate the environmental effects on the entanglement ,",
    "one - tangles and @xmath69-tangles are calculated for the multipartite system .",
    "it is seen that in case of phase damping channel , entanglement sudden death ( esd ) occurs for higher values of decoherence .",
    "whereas , for the phase flip channel , esd behaviour happens at @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , prominent behaviour of entanglement sudden birth ( esb ) is seen for @xmath67 in case of phase flip channel .",
    "therefore , it is investigated that the effect of environment is much stronger than that of acceleration for multipartite systems ."
