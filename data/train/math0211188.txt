    "this paper develops a new connection between matroid theory and enumerative combinatorics : with every pair of lattice paths @xmath0 and @xmath1 that have common endpoints we associate a matroid in such a way that the bases of the matroid correspond to the paths that remain in the region bounded by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these matroids , which we call lattice path matroids , appear to have a wealth of interesting and striking properties . in this paper",
    "we focus on the enumerative aspects of lattice path matroids , including the study of important matroid invariants like the tutte and the characteristic polynomials",
    ". structural aspects of lattice path matroids and their relation with other families of matroids will be the subject of a forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "lattice path matroids provide a bridge between matroid theory and the theory of lattice paths that , as we demonstrate here and in  @xcite , can lead to a mutually enriching relationship between the two subjects .",
    "one example starts with the path interpretation we give for each coefficient of the tutte polynomial of a lattice path matroid . computing the tutte polynomial of an arbitrary matroid",
    "is known to be @xmath5p - complete ; the same is true even within special classes such as graphic or transversal matroids . however , by using the path interpretation of the coefficients in the case of lattice path matroids , we show that the tutte polynomial of such a matroid can be computed in polynomial time . on the lattice path side , as we illustrate in section  [ sec : beta ] , this interpretation of the coefficients along with easily computed examples of the tutte polynomial can suggest new theorems about lattice paths .    relatively little matroid theory is required to understand this paper and what is needed is sketched in the first part of section  [ sec : back ] .",
    "we follow the conventional notation for matroid theory as found in  @xcite",
    ". a few topics of matroid theory of a more specialized nature ( the tutte polynomial , the broken circuit complex , the characteristic polynomial , and the @xmath4 invariant ) are presented in the sections in which they play a role .",
    "the last part of section  [ sec : back ] outlines the basic facts on lattice path enumeration that we use .",
    "lattice path matroids , the main topic of this paper , are defined in section  [ sec : lpm ] , where we also identify their bases with lattice paths ( theorem  [ thm : bases ] ) .",
    "we introduce special classes of lattice path matroids , among which are the catalan matroids and , more generally , the @xmath6-catalan matroids , for which the numbers of bases are the catalan numbers and the @xmath6-catalan numbers .",
    "we also treat some basic enumerative results for lattice path matroids and prove several structural properties of these matroids that play a role in enumerative problems that are addressed later in the paper . counting connected lattice path matroids on a given number of elements is the topic of section  [ sec : enum ] .",
    "the next four sections consider matroid invariants in the case of lattice path matroids .",
    "section  [ sec : tutte ] gives a lattice path interpretation of each coefficient of the tutte polynomial of a lattice path matroid ( theorem  [ active ] ) as well as generating functions for the tutte polynomials of the sequence of @xmath6-catalan matroids ( theorem  [ thm : tuttegf ] ) and , from that , a formula for each coefficient of each of these tutte polynomials ( theorem  [ thm : tuttecoefs ] ) . in section  [ sec : computing ] we give an algorithm for computing the tutte polynomial of any lattice path matroid in polynomial time ; we provide a second method of computation that applies for certain classes of lattice path matroid and which , although limited in scope , is particularly simple to implement on a computer . in section  [ sec : char ] we show that the broken circuit complex of a lattice path matroid is the independence complex of another lattice path matroid and we develop formulas for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial for special classes of lattice path matroids .",

    "vertices @xmath522 , with @xmath523 , are adjacent to all @xmath519 with @xmath524 and @xmath521 ; vertices @xmath525 , with @xmath526 , are adjacent to all @xmath519 with @xmath527 and @xmath521 .",
    "the graph @xmath528 is illustrated in figure  [ graph ] .",
    "it follows from the descriptions of presentations of free extensions and extensions by isthmuses that the bases of @xmath505 are precisely the sets of vertices in @xmath518 $ ] of maximal size that can be matched in @xmath517 .",
    "note that @xmath505 has as many bases as the matroid obtained by deleting the first @xmath6 elements ( which are loops ) and the last @xmath326 elements ( which are isthmuses ) ; let @xmath529 denote graph obtained from @xmath517 by deleting these vertices . the graph @xmath529 can be used to model @xmath85 iterations of the @xmath8-tennis ball problem : after relabelling vertices , those adjacent to @xmath530 can be viewed as the balls that could be selected to go in bin @xmath129 on first iteration ; those adjacent to @xmath531 can be viewed as the candidates to go in bin @xmath129 on the second iteration , and so on .",
    "furthermore , maximal - sized sets of vertices that can be matched in this graph are precisely the sets of balls that can be in bin @xmath129 at the end of @xmath85 iterations .",
    "thus , the answer to the @xmath8 tennis ball problem , with @xmath85 iterations , is the number of bases of the @xmath157-catalan matroid @xmath505 .",
    "the authors thank lou shapiro for interesting and useful discussions about the catalan numbers and the objects they count , and for bringing the tennis ball problem to our attention .",
    "the first author also thanks bill schmitt for further discussions about catalan numbers ."
