    "equation  ( [ eq : fp ] ) can be rewritten as the dynamics of the expansion coefficients @xmath12 of the density @xmath2 on such basis : @xmath13    an emission rate equation results : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 are the fluxes in @xmath7 for non - stationary modes ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "synaptic coupling in stationary ( @xmath18 ) and non - stationary modes is expressed in the vector @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the matrix @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of @xmath26 @xmath27",
    "in absence of synaptic coupling , incoming currents to the neurons do not depend on @xmath1 . hence ,",
    "both @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and eigenfunctions of @xmath26 are independent from @xmath1 . under these conditions eq .",

    "recursively deriving with respect to time both equations in ( [ eq : ereuncoupled ] ) , one obtains : @xmath34 and @xmath35 such that @xmath36    stopping derivations to the @xmath0-th order , an approximated expression for the emission rate equation results : @xmath37 and @xmath38 the coefficient matrix of this linear system is the vandermonde s matrix ( in a non - classical form ) , for which is known an explicit expression of its inverse .",
    "hence , the solutions for the unknown @xmath39 can be worked out allowing to rewrite the approximated emission rate equation as : @xmath40 note that , this ordinary differential equation ( ode ) depends only on the eigenvalues @xmath9 and the gain function @xmath32 .",
    "assuming an ordered spectrum of @xmath26 , such that @xmath41 if @xmath42 , this @xmath0-th order approximation of the emission rate equation is neglecting the dynamics at timescales smaller than @xmath43 . as for if neurons the eigenvalues are hierarchically distributed in couples of complex conjugates or in couples with similar real values , the second order ( @xmath44 ) approximation can be effective enough : @xmath45 here , @xmath46 has been used for convenience instead of @xmath47 .",

    "things change if a not too fast dynamics is considered .",
    "because the adopted moving basis @xmath64 rapidly adapts to the continuously varying moments of incoming currents , the hypothesis of a slow enough @xmath1 dynamics allows to consider the coefficients @xmath65 of the same order of the time derivative of the input : @xmath66 .",
    "so far , for small enough @xmath67 a good approximation is to neglect all the nonlinear terms @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "above expressions are then simplified as follows : @xmath73 and @xmath74 this set of equations together with the one for the stationary mode are a linear system equivalent to the one shown in the derivation of eq .",

    "time scales are increasingly shorter for large firing rates , as expected .",
    "furthermore , @xmath89 is well approximated by a linear combination of @xmath83 and @xmath28 .",
    "this should not surprise because for vif neurons @xmath90 , and in the plane @xmath91 iso - frequency curves are rotated parabolas : @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tauandomegauncoupled ] and @xcite ) . such relationship for other kinds of if neurons is expected to depend on the particular shape of their current - to - rate gain functions @xmath32 .",
    "the introduced approach can be used also in presence of non - stationary external currents ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) . considering synaptic current also due to the spiking activity of neurons outside the network , and firing at rate @xmath95 , the first two moments of this additional current become @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "what shown in the previous section applies here provided that also the derivatives with respect to @xmath98 are considered .",
    "an alternative way to reduce the dimensionality of the emission rate dynamics in this case , is to rely on a more straightforward adiabatic approximation @xcite . for very slow external currents ( @xmath99 )",
    ", the moving basis instantaneously adapts to the time varying input , and its movement is only mildly driven by the intrinsic timescales determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath26 . under this hypothesis ,",

    "although , all the modes of the expansion here can be considered , this approximation can not express damped oscillations . in order words",
