    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that oscillations in solar prominences and filaments can be excited by distant flares .",
    "such events have generally been characterized by so - called large- and small - amplitude oscillations according to the amplitude of the their observed velocities ( compared to the chromospheric sound and alfvn velocities ) .",
    "large - amplitude filament oscillations display speeds upwards of @xmath1 and periods of tens of minutes to hours , while small - amplitude oscillations typically are a few @xmath2 , with a less well - constrained range of periods , from minutes to hours @xcite .",
    "motions are found in both transverse and longitudinal directions with respect to the filament axis .",
    "the chromosphere displays a wealth of wave phenomena .",
    "early detections of oscillations in h@xmath0 measurements were carried out by @xcite , and @xcite used several chromospheric lines to observe the high - frequency ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 modes , as well as 5-min .",
    "acoustic modes , both escaping from the photosphere . however , a flare ( or some other source ) activating a filament oscillation is a rather rare phenomenon , quite different than the oscillations that are always present in the chromosphere .",
    "triggers of the filament activation are thought to be moreton waves or euv waves produced from remote flares @xcite , or jets and subflares @xcite , or even erupting filaments themselves @xcite .",
    "it is likely that intrinsic properties of the chromosphere can be deduced from studying these oscillations , as filaments seem to have associated eigenfrequencies when excited .",
    "this could be used to probe their magnetic structure and topology more precisely than traditional observations .",
    "recent reviews @xcite point out that much of the detailed dynamics between the interaction of the moreton or euv waves with the filament , the oscillatory structure ( vertical / horizontal and longitudinal / transverse ) , the damping mechanism , and possible causes of filament eruptions are still very open issues , as these filament oscillations have only been observed in about a dozen cases .",
    "the scope of this work is not to directly address all the issues above , but to provide a new tool for analyzing these and similar oscillatory phenomena .",
    "we have observed two oscillating filament events , one never detected and the other previously studied by @xcite .",
    "standard analysis in previous studies typically involves reducing a three - dimensional ( 3d ) data cube to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) time series by spatially averaging over pixels in the filament that appear to be oscillating , and then performing a wavelet transform in time - frequency space to ascertain the variable frequency content .",
    "the reduction in dimensions has the effect of smearing possibly important spatial information .",
    "at the same time , the result may be strongly dependent on how the averaging is carried out .    here",
    "we describe a new technique for analyzing phenomena that have dynamic spatial and temporal scales .",
    "it is an extension of a wavelet - type technique , preserving the 3d nature of the input data . upon application",
    ", we observe properties of chromospheric oscillations that do not easily fit into the two categories described above .",
    "we observe important differences in flaring regions and regions of oscillating filaments , indicating different responses to the trigger mechanism .",
    "we also find anomalies in oscillating filaments that have and have not interacted with a strong moreton wave .",
    "a standard analysis is also carried out for comparison .    to introduce this technique ,",
    "we first describe the example data sets in   [ dat ] .",

    "[ fig : regions ] . the flaring active regions ( bright in h@xmath0 ) , as well as several quiescent filaments ( dark in h@xmath0 ) that this investigation targets are outlined in boxes .",
    "one important difference between these two flares is that the 2006 event produced a prominent moreton wave @xcite , a fast - moving chromospheric disturbance .",
    "this particular wave propagated from the active region and interacted with several filaments on the solar disk , some quite far from the excitation location .",
    "filament - wave interactions in this flare were studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "a second important difference is the active region responsible for the 2006 event is located close to the limb , where strong ( horizontal ) velocity signals should be apparent in the line - of - sight doppler observations .",
    "studies of oscillations in filaments in the past have used velocity time series maps from both wings of a spectral line and determine when the filament transitions from red- to blueshifted , giving an estimation of the period ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "frequency content has also been derived by spatially averaging a set of pixels in the region of interest to produce a proxy 1d `` light curve , '' and then using wavelet techniques @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate a simple and powerful way of visualizing these types of data , that preserves both frequency and spatio - temporal information .",
    "we generate what we call `` _ _ frequency - filtered amplitude movies _ _ '' ( ffams ) , with a method similar to what would be described as 3d wavelet analysis .    to produce the ffams , consider a general data cube ( we will be working with intensity and doppler velocity ) of 2 spatial and 1 temporal dimensions , @xmath9 .",
    "assume there are @xmath10 time steps ( images ) available .",
    "for each time step @xmath11 , the following steps are carried out :    1 .",
    "filter the data in the time domain over a segment of length @xmath12 , which in this study is always taken to be 60 minutes , thus comprising @xmath13 images .",
    "the 60-min filter tapers off quickly , but smoothly to zero at each `` edge . '' in other words , only the subsequent @xmath14 images after the current time step are considered .",
    "the filtering is represented as @xmath15)\\cdot f(x , y , t),\\ ] ] where the brackets in the second argument of the filter @xmath16 denote the range where it is nonzero and equal to unity .",
    "the filtered data @xmath17 are labeled by the particular starting time step @xmath18 and the segment length @xmath12 .",
    "2 .   compute the temporal power spectrum of that segment @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the cyclic frequency . only the data over the segment",
    "@xmath12 will contribute to the power .",
    "we subsequently convert this power spectrum to an amplitude spectrum @xmath21 to get units of velocity when using doppler velocity data .",
    "3 .   apply a second filter @xmath22 in frequency to the amplitude spectrum , which has a central frequency @xmath23 and a bandwidth of @xmath24 , and compute the average over the frequencies in that particular band : @xmath25 where the @xmath26 operator indicates an average over the values of frequency in the range @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitude quantity @xmath28 is a two - dimensional image labeled by central frequency , bandwidth , and segment length .",
    "continue for all @xmath29 ( the final @xmath12 minutes are not computed to avoid the `` edge '' ) . the final data product , @xmath30 , is a three - dimensional quantity in @xmath31 .",

    "we consider frequencies in 1  mhz - wide bands , centered on the values @xmath32 , 3 , 5 , and 7  mhz .",
    "the temporal nyquist frequency for the isoon cadence is 8.3  mhz .",
    "the data sets in this study are approximately 420 minutes in length .",
    "since segments from which we compute the amplitude spectrum are only 60  min in length , the frequency sampling is @xmath33  mhz .",

    "the dramatic increase in amplitude occurs only once the flare erupts .",
    "if the @xmath4 modes were responsible , their effects would be present over the entire data sequence .",
    "secondly , the frequency range considered here is mostly below the photopsheric acoustic - cutoff frequency ( @xmath36  mhz ) .",
    "the filter bandpass of isoon is also quite narrow , much more so than the instrument used by @xcite , where both 5- and 3-minutes oscillations were seen in h@xmath0 .",

    "the 18:17 slice is about 23 minutes before the flare erupted , thus there is mostly pre - flare signal involved in the computation .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the flares `` excite '' all frequencies from about 0.5 to 7.5  mhz to detectable amplitudes in velocity ( note the figure is on a logarithmic scale ) .",
    "we are unaware of any previous studies that demonstrate this .",
    "the velocities in the 1  mhz band reach about @xmath37 and @xmath38 at peak amplitude for 2005 and 2006 data , respectively , and are usually reduced at higher frequencies .",
    "the stronger amplitudes in fr@xmath35 could be due to the fact that it is near the limb , thus implying stronger horizontal motions .",
    "interestingly , the 2006 flare s maximal amplitude is in the 3 mhz band , at about @xmath39 . in intensity",
    "the higher frequencies near each flare contribute much less oscillatory power , as is discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec : compare ] .",
    "once the flare erupts , the excess oscillatory amplitude lasts for about 100 minutes after the peak in the ffam , although this strongly depends on the location near the ribbons .",
    "some regions are damped much faster or more strongly than others . due to the 60  min time - averaging involved in creating the ffams , it is not convenient to determine the precise duration of the increase in oscillation amplitude , as the time resolution is insufficient to give certainty to this number .",
    "more spatial structure is seen in the 1  mhz band , especially in the plage area of the active regions , and the two flare ribbons in fr@xmath34 are somewhat visible in the oscillation amplitudes , as is the sunspot on the northern edge .",

    "one explanation of the different timings is that the filaments are at different distances from the flare center ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] ) , and whatever activation mechanism is at work ( such as a chromospheric wave ) needed to travel different distances .    the noticeable difference compared to the oscillations in the flare region , is that the filament only shows strong amplitude excess in the lowest frequency bandpass of @xmath41 , even on the logarithmic scale .",

    "[ stack_fr1 ] , for example ) , the coherent variations over an extended time period do not possess such amplitudes .",
    "we attribute the discrepancy with other values in the literature to the fact that the ffams select out the persistent variations over longer time scales ( in the computations here , at least 60  min ) , and thus it is a matter of effective time resolution .",
    "differences in instrumentation likely have some effects too .    for filament oscillation periods , studies have found a range from about 6 to 150 minutes @xcite . the periods found here are on the lower end of those values , but still consistent with them .",
    "one might argue that small - amplitude oscillations are a suitable classification for these events , which tend to have a few @xmath2 amplitudes , but can also have very short periods on the order of seconds to a few minutes , which we are unable to observe .",
    "@xcite have already studied both fl@xmath43 and fl@xmath44 using different data and standard methods . for fl@xmath43",

    "this work is important for two reasons : ( 1 ) we have presented a simple algorithm for both visualizing and studying dynamic phenomena in 2 + 1 dimensions with differing frequency content ; ( 2 ) we have used this technique to analyze two different events that exhibit low - frequency filament oscillations excited by a distant flare .",

    "photospheric modes can be ruled out as the source since the oscillation amplitude only increases after the flare initiates .",
    "strangely , the weaker filament oscillations are observed in the system that interacted with a strong moreton wave , which can trigger of such oscillations , but it is possible that line - of - sight effects or wave propagation direction can be involved in these differences .",
    "the velocities found in the ffam analysis do not fit into the large- and small - amplitude oscillation classifications",
    ". it might be useful to have sub - categories of such events that show oscillating strengths as a function of frequency .",
    "we have been able to confirm the work of @xcite who showed that the fr@xmath44 filament is a lower - amplitude oscillator than the other filament in the december 2006 flare event .",
    "the spatial features of the velocity power in the different frequency bands show interesting dynamics , particularly for the filaments .",
    "we observe different sections of the filaments fluctuating over various timescales , indicating that either the damping of the oscillations is spatial dependent or the excitation is not constant over the entire length of the filaments , or some combination of both effects .",
    "more detailed analysis of this is underway .",
    "there is both new and complementary information when comparing the original full - disk time series and the ffams ( the movies associated with fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] and the ffams of fig .",
    "[ fig : fd_bands ] ) .",
    "for example , for the 2005 event , in the raw intensity time series one clearly sees the reaction of some of the far - away filaments after flare eruption , but the ffam indicates that some filaments are actually not affected by the ( unknown ) trigger mechanism , and also directly provides the oscillation frequencies of those which are . in the 2006 flare",
    "the moreton wave is easily visible in both intensity and doppler data , yet the response of the filaments is rather muted when viewed in the ffam , suggesting that the oscillation activation was not as effective . certainly more events need to be treated in such a systematic fashion to understand if these are common occurences or not .",
    "we finally point out that at the photosphere , active regions typically show an enhancement of acoustic power at _ higher _ frequencies , known as acoustic halos @xcite .",
    "this is quite different than the case here where we see higher amplitudes in the lower - frequency bandpasses .",
    "how the frequency content of waves changes through the different layers of the atmosphere could help in understanding the local environment parameters that are quite difficult to directly observe , such as magnetic field and density .",
    "euv waves can also presumably interact with filaments , although for the two events studied here there were no euv data that could be used to identify any such contribution . in the future",
    "this method will be used to study a range of various chromospheric data .                            , j.  w. , duvall , jr . , t.  l. , jefferies , s.  m. , & pomerantz , m.  a. 1993 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol .",
