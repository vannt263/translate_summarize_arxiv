    "control theory has developed into a very broad and interdisciplinary subject .",
    "one of its major concerns is how to design the dynamics of a given system to steer it to a desired target state , and how to stabilize the system in a desired state . assuming that the evolution of the controlled system is described by a differential equation , many control methods have been proposed , including optimal control  @xcite , geometric control  @xcite and feedback control  @xcite .",
    "quantum control theory is about the application of classical and modern control theory to quantum systems .",
    "the effective combination of control theory and quantum mechanics is not trivial for several reasons . for classical control , feedback is a key factor in the control design , and there has been a strong emphasis on robust control of linear control systems .",
    "quantum control systems , on the other hand , can not usually be modelled as linear control systems , except when both the system and the controller are quantum systems and their interaction is fully coherent or quantum - mechanical  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for most applications , where we usually desire to control the dynamics of a quantum system through the interaction with fields produced by what are effectively classical actuators , whether these be control electrodes or laser pulse shaping equipment .",
    "moreover , feedback control for quantum systems is a nontrivial problem as feedback requires measurements , and any observation of a quantum system generally disturbs its state , and often results in a loss of quantum coherence that can reduce the system to mostly classical behavior . finally ,",
    "even if measurement backaction can be mitigated , quantum phenomena often take place on sub - nanosecond ( in many case femto- or attosecond ) timescales and thus require ultrafast control , making real - time feedback unrealistic at present .",
    "this is not to say that measurement - based quantum feedback control is unrealistic .",
    "there are various interesting applications , e.g. , in the area of laser cooling of atomic motion  @xcite , or for deterministic quantum state reduction  @xcite and stabilization of quantum states , to mention only a few , and progress in technology will undoubtedly lead to new applications .",
    "nonetheless , there are many applications of open - loop hamiltonian engineering in diverse areas from quantum chemistry to quantum information processing . even in the area of open - loop control many control design strategies , both geometry  @xcite and optimization - based  @xcite , utilize some form of model - based feedback .",
    "a particular example is lyapunov control , where a lyapunov function is defined and feedback from a model is used to generate controls to minimize its value . although there have been several papers discussing the application of lyapunov control to quantum systems , the question of when , i.e. , for which systems and objectives , the method is effective and when it is not , has not been answered satisfactorily .",
    "several early papers on lyapunov control for quantum systems such as  @xcite considered only control of pure - state systems , and target states that are eigenstates of the free hamiltonian @xmath0 , and therefore fixed points of the dynamical system . for target states that are not eigenstates of @xmath0 , i.e. , evolve with time , the control problem can be reformulated either in terms of asymptotic convergence of the system s actual trajectory to that of the time - dependent target state , or as convergence to the orbit of the target state ( or more precisely its closure ) .",
    "such cases have been discussed in several papers  @xcite but except for  @xcite , the problem was formulated using the schrodinger equation and state vectors that can only represent a pure state . to give a complete discussion of lyapunov control , it is desirable to utilize the density operator description as it is suitable for both mixed - state and pure - state systems , and can be generalized to open quantum systems subject to environmental decoherence or measurements , including feedback control . in  @xcite lyapunov control for mixed - state quantum systems was considered but the notion of orbit convergence used is rather weak compared to trajectory convergence , the lasalle invariant set was only shown to contain certain critical points but not fully characterized , and a stability analysis of the critical points was missing , in addition to other issues such as the assumption of periodicity of orbits , etc . furthermore , while an attempt was made to establish sufficient conditions to guarantee convergence to a target orbit , the effectiveness of the method for realistic system was not considered .    in this paper",
    "we address these issues .",
    "we consider the problem of steering a quantum system to a target state using lyapunov feedback as a trajectory tracking problem for a bilinear hamiltonian control system defined on a complex manifold , where the trajectory of the target state is generally non - periodic , and analyze the effectiveness of the lyapunov method as a function of the form of the hamiltonian and the initial value of the target state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basics ] the control problem and the lyapunov function are defined , and some basic issues such as different notions of convergence and reachability of target states are briefly discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lasalle ] the controlled quantum dynamics is formulated as an autonomous dynamical system defined on an extended state space , and lasalle s invariance principle  @xcite is applied to obtain a characterization of the lasalle invariant set .",
    "this characterization shows that even for ideal systems satisfying the strongest possible conditions on the hamiltonian , the invariant set is generally large , and the invariance principle alone is therefore not sufficient to conclude asymptotic stability of the target state . noting that the invariant set must contain the critical points of the lyapunov function we characterize the former in sec .",
    "[ sec : critical ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conv_ideal ] we give a detailed analysis of the convergence behaviour of the lyapunov method for finite - dimensional quantum systems under an ideal control hamiltonian based on the characterization of the lasalle invariant set and our stability analysis .",
    "the discussion is divided into three parts , control of pseudo - pure states , generic mixed states , and other mixed states .",
    "the result is for this ideal choice of hamiltonian lyapunov control is effective for most ( but not all ) target states .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conv_real ] we relax the unrealistic requirements on the hamiltonian imposed in sec .",
    "[ sec : conv_ideal ] , and show that this leads to a much larger lasalle invariant set , and significantly diminished effectiveness of lyapunov control .",
    "according to the basic principles of quantum mechanics the state of an @xmath1-level quantum system can be represented by an @xmath2 positive hermitian operator with unit trace , called a density operator @xmath3 , and its evolution is determined by the liouville von - neumann equation  @xcite @xmath4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the system hamiltonian , denoted by an @xmath2 hermitian operator .",
    "if we are considering a sub - system that is not closed , i.e. , interacts with an external environment , additional terms are required to account for dissipative effects , although in principle , we can always consider the hamiltonian dynamics on an enlarged hilbert space , and we shall restrict our discussion here to hamiltonian systems .",
    "we shall say a density operator @xmath3 represents a pure state if it is a rank - one projector , and a mixed state otherwise .",
    "we further define the special class of pseudo - pure states , i.e. , density operators with two eigenvalues , one of which occurs with multiplicity @xmath6 , the other with multiplicity @xmath7 , and generic mixed states , i.e. , density operators with @xmath1 distinct eigenvalues .      in the following we consider the bilinear hamiltonian control system @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is an admissible real - valued control field and @xmath0 and @xmath10",
    "are a free evolution and control interaction hamiltonian , respectively , both of which will be assumed to be time - independent .",
    "we have chosen units such that the planck constant @xmath11 and can be omitted for convenience .",
    "the general control problem is to design a certain control function @xmath9 such that the system state @xmath12 with @xmath13 will converge to the target state @xmath14 .",
    "since the evolution of a hamiltonian system is unitary , the spectrum of @xmath12 is therefore time - invariant , or equivalently @xmath15=\\tr[\\rho_0^n ] , \\quad \\forall n\\in \\nn.\\ ] ] hence , for the target state @xmath14 to be reachable , @xmath16 and @xmath14 must have the same spectrum , or entropy in physical terms .",
    "if @xmath16 and @xmath14 do _ not _ have the same spectrum , we can still attempt to minimize the distance @xmath17 , but it will always be non - zero if we are restricted to hamiltonian engineering . for the following analysis",
    "we shall assume that the initial and the target state of the system have the same spectrum .",
    "if this is the case and the system is density - matrix controllable , or pure - state controllable if the initial state of the system is pure or pseudo - pure , then we can conclude that the target state is reachable , although a particular target state may clearly be reachable even if the system is not controllable  @xcite .",
    "assuming that @xmath16 and @xmath14 have the same spectrum , the quantum control problem can be characterized by the spectrum of the target state . if @xmath14 is pure , the problem is called a pure - state control problem .",
    "analogously , we can define the pseuo - pure - state control and generic - state control .",
    "pure - state control problems are often represented in terms of hilbert space vectors or wavefunctions @xmath18 evolving according to the schrdinger equation @xmath19 for pure states this wavefunction descritpion is equivalent to the density operator description since any rank - one projector @xmath3 can be written as @xmath20 for some hilbert space vector @xmath18 , but it does not generalize to mixed states , and we shall not use this formalism here .    since the free hamiltonian @xmath0 can usually not be turned off , it is natural to consider non - stationary target states @xmath14 evolving according to @xmath21.\\ ] ] it is easy to see that @xmath14 is stationary if and only if it commutes with @xmath0 , @xmath22=0 $ ] .",
    "thus the problem of quantum state control for most target states is more akin to a trajectory tracking problem , where the objective generally is to find a control @xmath9 such that the trajectory @xmath12 of the initial state @xmath16 under the controlled evolution asymptotically converges to a target trajectory @xmath23 .",
    "it has been argued that the problem of quantum state control should instead be viewed as an orbit tracking problem  @xcite , i.e. , the problem of steering the trajectory @xmath12 towards the orbit of the target state @xmath14 .",
    "however , one problem with this approach is that the notion of orbit tracking is relatively weak as the orbit of a quantum state , or more precisely its closure , under free evolution can be rather large , and there are generally infinitely many distinct quantum states whose orbits under free evolution coincide .",
    "for example , even for two - level system evolving under the free hamiltonian @xmath24 the trajectories of the pure states @xmath25 are orthogonal , and thus perfectly distinguishable , for all times @xmath26 , @xmath27 , but their orbits are the same , @xmath28 .    for the two - level example above ,",
    "the orbits are always periodic and thus closed , and we can at least say that if the quantums state @xmath12 converges to the _ periodic orbit _",
    "@xmath29 of @xmath14 , then for every state @xmath30 there exists a sequence of times @xmath31 such that @xmath32 as @xmath33 , but this notion of convergence is much weaker than the notion of trajectory convergence , which requires @xmath34 as @xmath35 , and we shall see that there are cases where it is possible to track the orbit but _ not _ a particular trajectory . the notion of orbit tracking is even more problematic for non - periodic orbits , which comprise the vast majority of orbits for systems of hilbert dimension @xmath36 , except for the measure - zero set of hamiltonians @xmath0 with commensurate energy levels , i.e. , with transition frequencies that are rational multiples of each other . of course , we can still ask the question whether the state of the system converges to the _ closure _ of the orbit of a target state , but the dimension of this orbit set is generally very large . for instance , the state manifold of pure states for an @xmath1-dimensional system has ( real ) dimension @xmath37 , while the closure of the orbit of any state under a generic hamiltonian @xmath0 has dimension @xmath7 .",
    "for these reasons , we shall concentrate on quantum state control in the sense of trajectory tracking as this is the strongest notion of convergence and well - defined for arbitrary trajectories .",
    "a natural design of @xmath9 is inspired from the conception of lyapunov function , which is a very important tool in stability analysis for dynamical systems .",
    "for an autonomous dynamical system @xmath38 , a differentiable scalar function @xmath39 , defined on the phase space @xmath40 , is called a lyapunov function , if :    1 .",
    "@xmath39 is continuous and its partial derivatives are also continuous on @xmath41 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath39 is positive definite , i.e. , @xmath42 with equality only at @xmath43 ; 3 .   for any dynamical flow @xmath44 , @xmath45 .    with the conditions",
    "above , it can be shown that @xmath43 is lyapunov stable ; if equality in ( iii ) holds only for @xmath43 , we can further conclude that @xmath43 is asymptotically stable .",
    "however , in general , we can only guarantee @xmath46 , and in this case , we can only use a weaker result known as the lasalle invariance principle  @xcite , which claims that any bounded solution will converge to an invariant set , called the lasalle invariant set .",

    "the hartman - grobman theorem in centre manifold theory proved by carr  @xcite shows that all solutions outside @xmath87 converge exponentially to solutions on the centre manifold belonging to @xmath612 , while the solutions actually converging to @xmath612 only constitute a set of measure zero .",
    "therefore , when @xmath10 is not fully connected , the trajectories @xmath12 for most initial states @xmath659 will not converge to the target state @xmath14 ( or another critical point of @xmath91 ) but to other trajectories @xmath660 , which are not in orbit of @xmath14 either .",
    "next let us consider systems with @xmath10 fully connected but @xmath0 not strongly regular , such as @xmath661 i.e. , @xmath662 . in order to determine the subspace spanned by @xmath663",
    "[ see  ( [ eq : bm ] ) ] , we note that the characteristic vandermonde matrix  ( [ eq : vandermonde ] ) of the system @xmath664 has rank two as only the first two rows are linearly independent .",
    "we find that in this case the invariant set @xmath87 is characterized by @xmath137\\in\\c\\oplus\\span\\{\\mu,\\bar{\\mu}\\}$ ] with @xmath665 , @xmath666 .",
    "@xmath667= \\begin{pmatrix } 0                       & -\\beta_{12}\\delta_{12 }   & -\\beta_{13}\\delta_{23 }   \\\\ \\beta_{12}^*\\delta_{12 } & 0                        & -\\beta_{23}\\delta_{23 }   \\\\ \\beta_{13}^*\\delta_{23 } & \\beta_{23}^*\\delta_{23 } & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] where @xmath668 .",
    "thus @xmath137\\in \\c\\oplus\\span\\{\\mu,\\bar\\mu\\}$ ] implies @xmath649 and @xmath669 .",
    "so all @xmath670 form a two - dimensional manifold with coordinates determined by the @xmath671 and @xmath672 components of @xmath3 .",
    "as we are interested in the local dynamics near the target state , we again study the linearization at the fixed point @xmath14 for the case of a generic stationary state , i.e. , @xmath14 diagonal with non - degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "using the same notation as before , the matrix @xmath482 , i.e. , the restriction of @xmath673 to the subspace @xmath435 , has six non - zero eigenvalues @xmath674 , where @xmath675 occurs with multiplicity two , and since @xmath676 , we know that @xmath455 also has six non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "however , two of these are purely imaginary , namely @xmath675 , as it can easily be checked that @xmath677 , and the corresponding vectors are @xmath678 where @xmath679 . moreover , we know that all other eigenvalues of @xmath455 must have negative ( non - zero ) real parts .",
    "analogous to the last subsection , we can show that the invariant set @xmath87 forms a centre manifold near @xmath612 with @xmath612 as a centre .",
    "thus by the hartman - grobman theorem of the centre manifold theory , we can again infer that most of the solutions near @xmath612 will not converge to @xmath612 .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the lyapunov method for the problem of steering a quantum system towards a stationary target state , or tracking the trajectory of a non - stationary target state under free evolution , for finite - dimensional quantum systems governed by a bilinear control hamiltonian .",
    "although our results are partially consistent with previously published work in the area , our analysis suggests a more complicated picture than previously described .",
    "first , to allow proper application of the lasalle invariance principle we transform the original control problem into an autonomous dynamical systems defined on an extended state space . characterization of the lasalle invariant set for this system shows that it always contains the full set of critical points @xmath410 of the distance - like lyapunov function @xmath680 defined on the extended state space @xmath50 , where @xmath47 is the appropriate flag manifold for the density operators @xmath681 .",
    "consistent with previous work we show that the critical points of @xmath91 are the only points in the invariant set for ideal systems , i.e. , systems with strongly regular drift hamiltonian @xmath0 and fully connected control hamiltonian @xmath10 , and stationary target states @xmath14 .",
    "however , we also show that the invariant set is larger for non - stationary target states or non - ideal systems , the main difference being that for ideal systems , there is only a measure - zero set of target states for which the invariant set @xmath87 is larger than @xmath410 , while for non - ideal systems the invariant set is always significantly larger than @xmath410 .",
    "this observation is important because numerical simulations sugggest that lyapunov control design is mostly effective if the invariant set is limited to the critical points of @xmath91 , but likely to fail otherwise .",
    "our analysis for various cases explains why .    for a generic target state ( stationary or not ) there is always a finite set of @xmath234 critical points of @xmath91 , and it can be shown using stability analysis that all of these critical points , except the target state , are unstable .",
    "specifically , for a stationary generic target state we can show that all the critical points are hyperbolic critical points of @xmath91 and hyperbolic critical points of the dynamical system , with the target state being the only hyperbolic sink .",
    "all the other critical points are hyperbolic saddles , except for one hyperbolic source corresponding to the global maximum .",
    "although this picture is somewhat similar to that presented in  @xcite , our dynamical systems analysis shows the other critical points , referred to as antipodal points in  @xcite , are unstable , but except for the global maximum , not repulsive .",
    "in fact , all the hyperbolic saddles have stable manifolds of positive dimension .",
    "thus , the set of initial states that do not converge to the target state , even in this ideal case , is larger than the ( finite ) set of antipodal points itself , although for ideal systems and generic stationary target states , it is a measure - zero set of the state space . for stationary states with degenerate eigenvalues ( non - generic states )",
    "the set of critical points is much larger , forming a collection of multiple critical manifolds .",
    "however , for ideal systems we can show that even in this case the target state is the still the only hyperbolic sink of the dynamical system and asymptotically stable .",
    "thus , in general we can still conclude that most states will converge to the target state , although it is non - trivial to show that the set of states that converge to points on the other critical manifolds has measure zero , except for the class of pseudo - pure states .",
    "this class is special since the set of critial points in this case has only two components : a single isolated point corresponding to the global minimum of @xmath91 , which is a hyperbolic sink of the dynamical system , and a critical manifold homeomorphic to @xmath682 for @xmath683 , on which @xmath91 assumes its global maximum value @xmath401 .",
    "thus , although the points comprising the critical manifold are not repulsive , since @xmath91 is decreasing as function of @xmath26 , no initial states outside this manifold can converge to it .",
    "we note that this argument was employed in  @xcite to argue that the critical points other than the target state are ` repulsive ' but our analysis shows that it works only for the class of pseudo - pure states .",
    "thus , although our analysis suggest that , e.g. , that there are initial states other than the antipodal points that will not converge to the target state even for ideal systems , the set of states for which the lyapunov control fails is small , except for a measure - zero set of target states for which the invariant set contains non - critical points . for ideal system",
    "one could therefore conclude that the lyapunov method is overall an effective control strategy",
    ". however , most physical systems are not ideal , and the hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath10 are unlikely to satisfy the very stringent conditions of strong regularity and full connectedness , respectively .",
    "for instance , these assumptions rule out all systems with nearest - neighbour coupling only , as well as any system with equally spaced or degenerate energy levels , despite the fact that most of these systems can be shown to be completely controllable as bilinear hamiltonian control systems .",
    "in fact , the requirements for complete controllability are very low . any system with strongly regular drift hamiltonian @xmath0 ,",
    "whose transition graph is not disconnected , for instance , is controllable  @xcite , and in many cases even much weaker requirements suffice  @xcite . in practice , a bilinear hamiltonian system can generally fail to be controllable only if it is decomposable into non - interacting subsystems or has certain ( lie group ) symmetries , ensuring that , e.g. , the dynamics is restricted to a subgroup such as the symplectic group  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , our analysis shows that the picture changes drastically for non - ideal systems , with the target state ceasing to be a hyperbolic sink of the dynamical system and becoming a centre on a centre manifold contained in a significantly enlarged invariant set @xmath87 . using results from centre manifold theory",
    ", we must conclude that most of the solutions @xmath12 converge to solutions on the centre manifold other than the target state @xmath14 .",
    "this result casts serious doubts on the effectiveness of the lyapunov method for realistic systems , in fact , it strongly suggests that lyapunov control design is an effective method only for a very small subset of controllable quantum systems .",
    "these results appear to be in conflict with some recently published results on lyapunov control , which suggest that when the hamiltonian and target state satisfy a certain algebraic condition then any state @xmath659 that is not an ` antipodal ' point of @xmath48 asymptotically converges to the orbit of the target state @xmath23  @xcite , and claims that the ` antipodal ' points are repulsive . since",
    "the notion of orbit convergence that was used in  @xcite is weaker than the notion of convergence in the sence of trajectory tracking we have used , one might conjecture this to be the source of the discrepancy , and since orbit tracking may be quite adequate for many control problems that do not require precise phase control , for instance , this could mean that lyapunov control might still be an effective control strategy for many quantum control problems .",
    "however , this does not appear to be the case here .",
    "for instance , the notions of orbit and trajectory tracking are identical for stationary target states but even for ideal systems and stationary generic target states that satisfy the conditions in  @xcite , our analysis suggests that the antipodal points , except one global maximum , are hyperbolic saddle points and hence unstable but not repulsive .",
    "furthermore , careful analysis of our results shows that for ideal systems convergence of @xmath12 to the orbit of @xmath23 implies @xmath393 except for a measure - zero set of target states @xmath23 .",
