    "the bootstrap algorithm can be applied directly , however , only to determine the uncertainties in quantities obtained from an ensemble whose individual members are statistically independent .",
    "we therefore partitioned each ensemble of correlated gauge configurations into successive disjoint bins with a fixed bin size .",
    "bootstrap ensembles were then formed by randomly choosing a number of entire bins equal to the number of bins in the original partitioned ensemble . for bins sufficiently large , propagator averages found on distinct bins will be nearly independent .",
    "it follows that for large enough bins , the binned bootstrap estimate of errors will be reliable .",
    "it is not hard to show that once bins are made large enough to produce nearly independent bin averages , further increases in bin size will leave bootstrap error estimates nearly unchanged . the only variation in errors as the bin size",
    "is increased further will come from statistical fluctuations in the error estimates themselves . to determine the required bin size for a particular error estimate to be reliable we applied the bootstrap method repeatedly with progressively larger bin sizes until the estimated error became nearly independent of bin size .",

    "overall , it appears to us safe to conclude that at @xmath33 of 5.93 the difference between scalar and tensor masses for @xmath39 of 16 and their infinite volume limits are of the order of 0.5% or less . in section  [",
    "sect : cont ] we show that the scalar and tensor glueball masses in tables  [ tab : finalz ] and [ tab : finalt ] with @xmath33 of 5.93 and greater and @xmath97 fixed at about 13 are not far from asymptotic scaling .",
    "we therefore expect the fractional volume dependent errors found in these masses to be about the same as the errors at @xmath33 of 5.93 .",
    "thus the finite volume errors in all masses in tables  [ tab : finalz ] and [ tab : finalt ] with @xmath33 of 5.93 and greater and @xmath97 of about 13 should be 0.5% or less .",

    "the constancy of @xmath99/[m_{\\rho}(a ) a]$ ] as a function of @xmath105 or equivalently as a function of @xmath33 can not be explained by a cancellation of an @xmath104 term in @xmath100 with an @xmath104 term in @xmath98 since @xmath100 is defined to fulfill the true continuum two - loop callan - synamzik equation and itself has no @xmath104 corrections .",
