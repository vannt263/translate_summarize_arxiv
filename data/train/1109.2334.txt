    "josephson junctions are of common use in many technological devices and their behavior as a circuit element is described in textbooks;@xcite the influence of thermal fluctuations on the normal current is described as johnson noise .",
    "the voltage due to thermal noise was studied by ambegaokar and halperin.@xcite    in this study we are interested in the equilibrium fluctuations of the supercurrent .",
    "since supercurrent is actually an equilibrium variable rather than a diffusion process , we may expect  and will indeed find  that its fluctuations are qualitatively different from those of the normal current .",
    "early works on fluctuations in junctions@xcite state that there is no noise in supercurrent to quadratic order in the temperature . on the other hand , averin and",
    "imam@xcite found that supercurrent fluctuations in mesoscopic contacts are large on the scale of the classical shot noise .",
    "the kind of junction considered in this article is a filament close to the critical temperature , which can be described by means of the ginzburg  landau model .",
    "if the entire filament has a critical temperature that is above the experimental temperature @xmath0 , the filament may be regarded as a constriction ; if parts of the filament have a critical temperature above @xmath0 , it may be regarded as an sns junction . in the case that fluctuations are ignored , the junction - like behavior of a filament has been studied for static@xcite and for dynamic@xcite situations .    the situation we will study here is a case of dynamic equilibrium .",
    "we will consider a superconducting filament that bridges between two  banks . \" at the banks fluctuations are negligible and the order parameter will have fixed equilibrium values , whereas along the filament the order parameter and the electromagnetic potential fluctuate . in the absence of fluctuations , the current along the filament would be given by the current  phase relation .",
    "we will use the time - dependent ginzburg  landau ( tdgl ) equations with langevin terms , which will be handled numerically by means of finite differences .",
    "we have described this method in detail in the past@xcite and shown good agreement with statistical mechanics and with experiments .    for a 1d filament",
    "we define the gauge - invariant order parameter @xmath1\\psi ( s)$ ] , where @xmath2 is the arc length , @xmath3 the  canonical \" order parameter , @xmath4 the tangential component of the vector electromagnetic potential and @xmath5 the quantum of flux .",
    "the 1d - tdgl equation can be written as@xcite u =- ps . , [ gil ] where @xmath6 is the mass of a cooper pair , @xmath7 the cross section of the filament , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are material parameters ; the sign of @xmath9 determines whether the local critical temperature is above or below @xmath0 .",
    "we will take the boundary conditions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the length of the filament ; @xmath14 is the gauge - invariant phase difference .",
    "the scaled values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 will be kept fixed in the present study . since @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of temperature , the physical meaning of this exposition",
    "is that for each temperature the experiment is performed on a different sample .",
    "the normal current @xmath15 and the supercurrent @xmath16 are not separately constant along the filament .",
    "we define the supercurrent as the weighted average @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 appears as a natural weight in refs . ; in this work we consider uniform cross section only , so that this weight and the last term in eq .",
    "( [ gil ] ) can be ignored .",
    "we have examined two cases .",
    "one of them is a uniform filament with @xmath19 ; in the second case we took @xmath20 , so that the middle of this filament is nominally normal . in both cases we took @xmath21 and the resistance of the filament as @xmath22 .",
    "the filament was divided into 30 computational cells and evolution was followed in steps of duration @xmath23 .",
    "the first @xmath24 steps had the purpose of relaxation to typical values of @xmath25 and then @xmath26 steps were used for averaging .",
    "our results do not depend appreciably on the resistance or the steps duration .",
    "the averages shown in the figures are averages over time and @xmath27 denotes the supercurrent in the absence of thermal fluctuations .    using bcs , dirty limit@xcite and free electron gas approximations , our choices for @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "can be inverted and regarded as choices for the geometric parameters .",
    "we obtain l^2=^2 k_f_e/6mk_b(t_c - t ) , w=0.51l / n_e_e^2 , [ micro ] where @xmath28 is the fermi wavevector , @xmath29 the mean free path , @xmath30 the critical temperature of the banks and @xmath31 the electron density .",
    "figure [ dcurr ] shows the average deviation of @xmath32 from @xmath27 as a function of @xmath14 for several temperatures .",
    "we see that fluctuations not only lead to variance of the supercurrent , as in the case of normal current , but also lead to a shift of the average value .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath27 are negative for @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 . for a material with critical temperature of the order of 1k , the highest temperature in fig .",
    "[ dcurr ] corresponds to a filament length of the order of 30 nm and the highest current deviation , to the order of 10 na .",
    "the @xmath14-dependence of @xmath35 has some resemblance with that of @xmath27 , which has been included in the figure for comparison .",
    "figure  [ tdcurr ] presents @xmath35 as a function of temperature ; it is apparent that this deviation behaves differently for different values of @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ std ] shows the standard deviation of @xmath32 as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "note that whereas the standard deviation of johnson noise is inversely proportional to the square root of the probing time ( provided that it is long compared to @xmath36 ) , the standard deviation of @xmath32 is independent of the probing time ( provided that it is short compared to the decoherence time that we will find below ) .",
    "in addition , the standard deviation of @xmath32 depends on the phase difference , whereas that of @xmath37 does not . on the other hand , the present result does not support the scenario assumed in ref .  , according to which fluctuations of the order parameter just scale the supercurrent , while the shape of the current - phase relation remains fixed ; if this were the case , the standard deviation of @xmath32 would be proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ tstd ] shows the temperature dependence of the standard deviation of @xmath32 .",
    "whereas for the normal current the standard deviation is proportional to @xmath38 , for the supercurrent this scaling occurs only in the case @xmath39 ; as @xmath40 decreases towards 0 , the initial slope of the curves decreases .",
    "figure [ correl ] shows the autocorrelation of the supercurrent , @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "we see that , the smaller the value of @xmath14 , the shorter the typical time required to  forget \" a previous value of @xmath32 .",
    "the inset shows the spectral density @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath32 is measured many times during probing periods of length @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then each measurement can essentially be regarded as instantaneous and the standard deviation of @xmath32 is given by fig .",
    "[ std ] , with practically no @xmath44-dependence ; if @xmath46 , then fluctuations of @xmath32 essentially become white noise and the standard deviation of @xmath32 should decrease as @xmath47 . according to fig .",
    "[ correl ] , the crossover value of @xmath44 ( the  decoherence time \" ) increases with @xmath14 and is of the order of @xmath48 ( for @xmath49 m , this is of the order of @xmath50s ) .    the faster relaxation of fluctuations for small @xmath14 is counterintuitive , since according to fig .  [ std ]",
    "the influence of thermal agitation is stronger for large @xmath14 , and we might expect this agitation to destroy any particular configuration of the order parameter that results in a particular supercurrent at a given time .",
    "figure  [ nofl ] shows that the @xmath14-dependence of the relaxation times of @xmath32 is not dominated by thermal agitation , but rather by the fluctuationless dynamics . at @xmath51 memory loss of particular configurations is faster for small @xmath14 ; thermal agitation moderates the @xmath14-dependence .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case @xmath52 thermal agitation leads to delay of the relaxation .    the results in figs .",
    "[ std ] and [ nofl ] can be interpreted as follows . in the case",
    "@xmath52 the order parameter is pinned with the same phase at both boundaries , giving a large energy advantage to a uniform order parameter all along the filament .",
    "therefore , the system is comparatively rigid : deviations from the equilibrium configuration are small and return to equilibrium is fast . in the case",
    "@xmath39 the order parameter is pinned with opposite phases at the boundaries , so that the system is frustrated and comparatively indifferent ; as a consequence , deviations from equilibrium are large and return to it is slow .      here",
    "we report the results for the case @xmath53 .",
    "although taking a value of @xmath9 that vanishes on the average may look as a drastic change , the results are remarkably similar to those of the previous section .",
    "figure [ dcurrn ] shows the average deviation of @xmath54 from @xmath55 for the same temperatures as in fig .",
    "[ dcurr ] .",
    "we note that in the present case the reduction of @xmath32 is smaller than in the case of a uniform filament .",
    "this behavior makes sense , since when the entire filament is superconducting fluctuations may only be expected to destroy superconductivity ; on the other hand , when half of the filament is normal and supercurrent can only be expected due to proximity or fluctuations , fluctuations also have a supportive effect . for @xmath39",
    "the average current has to vanish by symmetry ; the scattering in this value serves as a measure of the accuracy of our results .",
    "figure [ stdn ] shows the standard deviation of @xmath54 and compares it with that of a uniform filament . for small values of @xmath14",
    "the standard deviation is similar to that of fig .",
    "[ std ] , but as @xmath14 approaches @xmath56 the standard deviation in the present case is noticeable smaller than that of a uniform filament .",
    "this result may seem surprising , since in the present case superconductivity is more fragile and we might expect to larger fluctuations .",
    "a possible explanation could be that when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are both positive , large fluctuations of the order parameter in the middle of the filament are inhibited , leading to smaller fluctuations of @xmath32 .",
    "figure [ tstdn ] presents these results as functions of the temperature . in the present case",
    "the standard deviation does not become proportional to @xmath38 even for @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ startn ] compares the autocorrelation functions for the cases @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "again , we find that the difference is remarkably small , especially for small @xmath40 .",
    "weakening of superconductivity leads to a slightly faster decoherence .",
    "we have evaluated numerically the thermal fluctuations of the supercurrent along filaments that bridge between two banks ( superconducting pieces with dimensions such that fluctuations in them are negligible ) in an equilibrium situation .",
    "one case we considered was that of a uniform filament , made of the same material as the banks ; the second case was that of a filament equal to the first at the contact points , but normal in the middle .    these fluctuations have non trivial properties , qualitatively different from those of normal current . on the other hand , in spite of the blatant difference between both considered filaments , the difference between the fluctuations in them is minor , suggesting that the results we have found are generic .",
    "experimentally , a phase difference may be applied by connecting the banks so that together with the filament they become a closed circuit that encloses a known magnetic flux ; the current can then be sensed through the field that it induces .",
    "measurement of @xmath27 is complicated by the fact that changing the temperature would also change the value of @xmath9 .",
    "let us now discuss measurement of the standard deviation of @xmath32 .",
    "the probing time should be of the order of @xmath57 , which in view of eq .",
    "( [ micro ] ) is of the order of @xmath58 , and ought to be accessible for temperature sufficiently close to @xmath30 . for this probing time , using our results in fig .",
    "[ tstd ] or [ tstdn ] , eq .",
    "( [ micro ] ) , and the free electron gas expression for the resistivity , we estimate that the ratio between the standard deviation of @xmath32 and that of johnson noise is of the order of @xmath59 ; since this is not a small number , fluctuations of the supercurrent are not obscured by those of the normal current and could in principle be observed .",
    "the present study may be regarded as a feasibility test for the influence of supercurrent fluctuations .",
    "analytic treatments that uncover the scalings and asymptotic relations , as well as the non equilibrium behavior , are still required .",
    "this research was supported by the israel science foundation , grant no .",
    "i have benefited from comments from grzegorz jung and baruch rosenstein .",
    "the equilibrium average of the supercurrent is given by i_s = i_s+i_n= , [ current ] where @xmath61 is the partition function , which has to be derived from the ginzburg  landau free energy f=_0^l w ds [ |ps .",
