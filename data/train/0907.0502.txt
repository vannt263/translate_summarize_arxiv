    "it has been found almost 30 years ago that quantum hall systems can be excited effectively by terahertz ( thz ) radiation , because the energy gap between the landau levels is comparable to the photon energy ( 3  thz@xmath012.4  mev ) .",
    "first photoconductivity investigations using gaas / algaas heterostructures , patterned in a hall bar , showed a strong photoresponse @xmath1 of the longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath2 under thz radiation@xcite . in these studies ,",
    "two contributions to the photoresponse were found : a non - resonant signal as well as a cyclotron resonant ( cr ) component .",
    "furthermore , it was observed that the magnetic field dependence of @xmath1 is similar to that of the temperature derivative of the longitudinal resistance @xmath2 ( see e.g. refs . ) . today",
    "it is well established that the non - resonant part is caused by a lattice heating of the whole sample , whereas the cr signal arises form electron gas heating due to the cyclotron absorption inside the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "more recently , hirakawa et al.@xcite have observed a deviation of the photoresponse from the electron gas heating model at filling factors @xmath3 and low bias currents .",
    "they suggested that the deviation from the heating model arises from the non - equilibrium edge - channel transport , which affects the photoresponse .",
    "however , the effect of edge - channel transport on the photoresponse is not yet fully understood .",
    "recently , wrtz et al.@xcite reported on the development and application of a sample geometry which allows a direct measurement of the transport between adjacent edge - channels at the sample boundaries , where the two edge - channels are separated only by one incompressible strip .",
    "this allows for the investigation of the transport properties across the incompressible strip using four - point resistance measurements@xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we will present thz photoresponse measurements on a quasi - corbino sample .",
    "the experimental data from our dc and thz measurements suggest that the origin of the photoresponse is a photovoltaic effect , rather than a bolometric change in conductivity .",
    "we show that the photo voltage arises from a photocurrent , generated inside the incompressible edge strip , which acts as an illuminated `` edge - channel diode '' .",
    "furthermore , spectrally resolved measurements reveal a reduced effective cyclotron mass , which indicates that the photo voltage originates from the edge of the sample and supports the photodiode model to describe the photo voltage .",
    "a two dimensional electrongas ( 2deg ) is formed in a mbe ( molecular beam epitaxy ) grown gaas / algaas heterostructure , consisting of a 1  @xmath4 m  gaas buffer , 20  nm undoped algaas , followed by a si @xmath5-doping layer , and again 5  nm  algaas , covered by a 40  nm superlattice , and 5  nm  gaas cap layer .",
    "the carrier concentration and the mobility are about @xmath6@xmath7 and @xmath8@xmath9/vs , respectively , at 4.2  k. the sample structure is defined by standard photolithography and wet chemical etching .",
    "the gate electrode consists of 50  nm thermally evaporated au .",
    "ohmic contacts are provided by alloyed auge / ni / auge  @xmath10 pads .     in the ungated region and @xmath11 under the gate",
    "( see also ref . ) . ]",
    "+ figure [ fig : sample_setup ] schematically shows the topology of the sample , consisting of a ring - shaped ( corbino ) mesa and a horse - shoe shaped gate .",
    "the ring - shaped mesa is shown by the thick outline and the gate electrode is indicated by the grey shaded area . in the quantum hall regime and at zero gate voltage , edge - channels develop along the sample boundaries , which are well separated by the semi - insulating bulk in the inner region .",
    "therefore , the present quasi - corbino geometry has two independent sets of edge - channels , called inner and outer edge - states in the following . applying a suitable negative gate voltage ,",
    "the inner edge - state can be redirected to run along the outer edge - state in the gap region ( see thin lines with arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample_setup ] ) . whereas the outer edge - states are connected to the outer ohmic contacts 1 and 2 , the innermost edge - states are connected to the interior contacts 3 and 4 .",
    "this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample_setup ] , where the filling factors have been adjusted to @xmath12 in the ungated region and @xmath11 under the gate .",
    "when the bulk region of the 2deg under the gate is in its insulating state ( integer filling factor and sufficiently low temperatures ) current transport between inner and outer ohmic contacts is possible only by charge equilibration among neighboring channels in the gap region .",
    "the present geometry therefore allows for a direct investigation of transport across the incompressible strip that separates the compressible edge - channels within the gate gap@xcite .",
    "furthermore , as we will show in the following , it makes it possible to investigate the thz - induced transport between two edge - states , without any bulk effects .",
    "+ in the present experiment , we record the photo voltage @xmath13 as a function of the bias current .",
    "a constant current @xmath14 is applied between contacts 1 and 3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sample_setup ] ) and the non - local voltage at contacts 2 and 4 is measured using a high - impedance ( @xmath15 ) voltage preamplifier .",
    "the hg lamp of a bruker ifs113v fourier - transform spectrometer ( fts ) , a black poly filter , and a @xmath16 m mylar beam splitter is used as a thz light source .",
    "we perform two types of experiments . in the integrated mode we stop the mirror scanner of the fts ,",
    "chop the thz radiation at 20  hz with a chopper inside the beam - path and measure the photo voltage in lock - in technique . in a second mode we use , without chopper , the spectrally resolved mode of the fts .",
    "a system of mirrors , and polished stainless steel tubes , acting as oversized waveguides , guides the thz radiation to the sample , mounted inside a he@xmath17 cryostat with a base temperature of 300  mk .",
    "the he@xmath17 system it self is located in a he@xmath18 cryostat with a superconducting magnet , to apply fields up to @xmath19  t , where b is perpendicular to the surface normal of the 2deg .",

    "furthermore , a characteristic onset voltage of the order of the landau gap ( @xmath26 ) is observed at positive bias currents and an almost constant differential resistance at biases exceeding this onset voltage . for reverse bias",
    "the @xmath25 trace shows a nonlinear behavior , but no distinct onset voltage can be observed . under forward bias",
    "no current will flow until almost flatband conditions are reached , because the thermal energy ( @xmath27  mev ) is much smaller than the built - in potential barrier ( @xmath28  mev ) .",

    "[ fig : dc_urr_isd ] is used . ]",
    "we observe a pronounced maximum of @xmath31v at zero bias current and a strongly decreasing signal for higher bias currents , in either polarity .",
    "furthermore , the experimentally obtained photo voltage exhibits an asymmetry between positive and negative bias currents . with increasing positive current",
    ", the photo voltage decreases very fast and no signal can be observed above @xmath32  na , whereas at negative bias a small signal remains even at a bias current of @xmath33  na .",
    "the occurrence of a photovoltage at zero bias current is striking and clearly shows that the signal is not caused by a bolometric effect ( or any other effect that merely changes the resistance of the sample ) .",
    "rather , there must be a mechanism which converts the thz illumination into a separation of charge .",
    "absorption in the bulk is not a likely explanation , since it would not lead to the breaking of symmetry required for the observation of a distinct voltage .",
    "furthermore , an effect of illumination of the ohmic contacts can be ruled out , because only the gate gap region is irradiated .",
    "+ to quantitatively explain the photo voltage of a quasi - corbino sample , we take the model discussed above one step further and assume that the reconstructed edge ( see fig . [ fig : potential ] ( b , c ) ) is comparable to a diode not only under dark conditions but also under illumination with thz radiation .",
    "the photo excitation process inside an incompressible edge strip at zero bias current is sketched on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ( b ) .",
    "because of the built - in electric field in the incompressible edge strip , photo - excited electron - hole pairs become spatially separated , which causes a negative photocurrent even at zero bias current in complete analogy to the case of a photodiode@xcite ( see fig .  [ fig : potential ] ( c ) ) . as depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : dc_urr_isd ] we therefore expect that the @xmath25 trace is shifted along the current axis to negative values under illumination .",
    "for @xmath34 , this shifted @xmath25 characteristic reveals it self as the open circuit photo voltage @xmath35 . assuming a constant photocurrent @xmath22@xcite , the photo voltage is then given by @xmath36 at any bias current @xmath14 ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : dc_urr_isd ] ) . to calculate the photo voltage from the @xmath25 trace according to equation ( [ eq : def_u_potodiode ] ) we have to know the photocurrent . but",
    "knowing the zero bias resistance @xmath37 of the diode , it is straight forward to derive the photocurrent @xmath22 from the photo voltage @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is obtained from the slope of the @xmath25 trace around @xmath34 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dc_urr_isd ] ) .",
    "+ figure [ fig : pc_isd ] shows the photo voltage , calculated from the @xmath25 trace in the dark shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dc_urr_isd ] , according to equations ( [ eq : def_u_potodiode ] ) and ( [ eq : calc_i_photo ] ) ( open circles ) , compared to the experimentally observed photo voltage ( closed circles ) .",
    "the good agreement between the calculated and the measured photo voltage , without any fit parameter , strengthens the picture discussed above that the transport across a single incompressible edge strip can be described within a simple backward diode model , under dark condition as well as under illumination with thz radiation .",
    "it should be pointed out that already 20 years ago a similar mechanisem was proposed by liu et al .",
    "@xcite for cobion disks with a gate - induced potential step in the bulk of the sample .",
    "+ furthermore , the observed asymmetry in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc_isd ] is also reproduced by the calculated photo voltage .",
    "it results from the fact that for bias currents @xmath41  na the differential resistance is higher for negative polarity than for positive polarity .",
    "accordingly , a shift in current ( induced by the photo - generated carriers ) translates into a smaller voltage for @xmath42 na than for @xmath43 na .",
    "we would like to note that we measure very similar behavior at filling factors @xmath44 and @xmath11 ( not shown ) .      for spectrally resolved measurements we remove the chopper , turn on the moving mirror of the fts and use the sample as a photo detector to record the intensity of the modulated light . in the spectral range of interest ,",
    "the light source and all optical components have a very weak dependence on wavelength , so that the recorded signal will be dominated by the spectral response of the sample it self ( for a similar experiment to record the bolometric response in the quantum hall effect , see ref . ) .",
    "t for the adjusted filling factor combination @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "the photo voltage is measured between contacts 2 and 6 at zero bias current .",
    "the dashed line shows the best lorentz fit to the data . ]",
    "figure [ fig : spectral ] shows the spectral response of the sample , obtained by feeding the open circuit voltage between contacts 1 and 3 into the fts and processing 800 co - added interferograms .",
    "a weak single resonance is observed , where the signal amplitude is about a factor of 2000 weaker than the photoconductivity signal on a sample from the same wafer but in standard corbino topology ( see ref . ) . as indicated by the dashed line",
    ", the resonance can be fitted by a lorentzian profile with a resonance position at @xmath45 .",
    "the linewidth of @xmath46 is comparable to the width expected from the bolometric , photoconductivity signal ( @xmath47 ) in standard corbino topology and the width deduced from the transport mobility and the carrier density of the sample ( see e.g. ref . ) . from the resonance position and the applied magnetic field we can deduce an effective cyclotron mass of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the free electron mass",
    "this mass , surprisingly , is somewhat smaller than the cyclotron mass commonly observed in gaas / algaas heterostructures at high magnetic fields ( @xmath50)@xcite .",
    "it is also smaller than the cyclotron mass of @xmath51 which has been observed for the 2d bulk , bolometric , photoconductivity signal on a sample from the same wafer but in standard corbino topology ( see ref . ) .",
    "+ the observation of a reduced effective mass further supports the conclusion that the observed photo voltage does not arises from the 2d bulk cyclotron resonance as the bolometric contribution .",
    "a simple explanation for the reduction of the effective mass compared to the 2d cyclotron mass is that the electrons experience an additional confinement potential due to the depletion field inside the incompressible edge strips .",
    "such an additional confinement will shift the observed resonance to higher frequencies , resulting in a reduced effective cyclotron mass ( see also refs . ) .",
    "therefore , the observation of a reduced effective mass supports the picture that the photo voltage is caused by a photocurrent generated inside the incompressible edge strip between two adjacent edge - channels .",
    "+ in contrast to the spectrally resolved photoresponse of samples in standard corbino topology ( see ref . ) and samples in hall - bar topology ( see ref . )",
    ", where a asymmetric broadening at filling factors @xmath3 is observed , here we observe only one symmetric resonance .",
    "in fact , we identify the resonance in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral ] as the high - energy contribution , which leads to the asymmetry observed in refs .. the low - energy contribution , which is caused by bolometric effects in the bulk is not observed in the present experiment , which is mostly sensitive to the edge excitation .",
    "in conclusion , we have used a quasi - corbino sample geometry to study the photoresponse of a two - dimensional electron gas in the quantum hall regime .",
    "the sample geometry allows for the investigation of thz - induced transport across only one incompressible strip .",
    "a photo voltage is observed with a characteristic dependence on the bias current which shows that the origin of the photo voltage is clearly a thz - induced photo current and not a change in conductivity , which is the dominating mechanism in hall bar samples .",
    "the spectrally resolved measurements give a reduced effective mass , which further supports that the photo current originates from the edge of the sample .",
    "together with the good agreement between the experimental observed photo voltage and the one calculated from a photodiode model , we can further conclude that the photo current is generated inside the incompressible edge strips , which acts as an illuminated `` edge - channel diode '' .",
    "+ furthermore , the model of an illuminated `` edge - channel diode '' offers an explanation for the asymmetric broadening observed in spectrally resolved photoresponse measurements on samples in standard corbino topology ( see ref . ) as well as in hall - bar topology ( see ref . ) .",
