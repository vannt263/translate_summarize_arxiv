    "the ability to produce semiconductor systems with sufficiently long spin relaxation time and spin diffusion length is expected to lead to a design of reliable spin transport devices.@xcite also , the problem of theoretical description of systems with a very long relaxation time and understanding the physics of the limits for the spin relaxation rate is of a fundamental interest . the major ingredient required for the spin relaxation is spin - orbit coupling , which usually has the form of the wavevector dependent effective magnetic field . in quantum",
    "well structures there are two contributions to this field , namely , linear in the in - plane momentum rashba @xcite and dresselhaus @xcite terms .",
    "one of the fundamental aspects in this understanding is that the very low relaxation rates for some spin directions are related to the specific symmetry of the spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian.@xcite    one of the hopes at a possible realization of a very long spin relaxation time system is related to the ( 110 ) gaas quantum wells . in these structures",
    "the form of the bulk inversion asymmetry ( dresselhaus ) spin - orbit coupling prevents relaxation of the spin component parallel to the growth axis [ 110 ] . here",
    "the effective field is always collinear with this axis , @xcite and , therefore , the spin , oriented along it , experiences no torque .",
    "however , the experiment clearly demonstrates finite spin coherence lifetime @xcite causing the discussion of its origin .",
    "a possible explanation can be related to the effects of intersubband scattering of electrons and intersubband spin - orbit coupling,@xcite which become efficient at relatively high temperatures and depend strongly on the disorder in the quantum well .",
    "calculations show the dephasing times being on the order of ten nanosecond at @xmath0 k.@xcite with the temperature decrease , the relaxation time rapidly increases , and for the values of disorder , corresponding to the measured mobility , exceeds the observed one by more than two orders of magnitude.@xcite therefore , other causes for the experimentally observed dephasing rates should be looked for .",
    "the possible mechanism can be related to the intrinsic disorder in the rashba coupling .",
    "if the carriers in the well come from the donors , the electric field of the ionized donors causes a random rashba field.@xcite the corresponding effective magnetic field is directed in the structure plane , and , therefore , can influence the growth - direction component of the spin .",
    "its randomness causes random spin precession and leads to the finite spin relaxation rate .",
    "if the coulomb field of the donors can be reduced , the relaxation time can be made longer .",
    "this can be achieved by using multiple quantum wells , bringing about two new physical effects not considered in previous works to the best of our knowledge .",
    "first , coulomb forces can be strongly reduced by the screening due to the presence of conduction electrons .",
    "second effect in these structures is the spin - flip scattering of electrons from different quantum wells . in these collisions",
    "spin of one electron remains constant while the spin of the other flips .",
    "this non - conservation arises due to the spin - orbit coupling effect in the scattering process .",
    "it is very similar to the spin - flip scattering by charged donors : screened electric field of electron in one well induces a rashba field acting on the electron spin in the other well .",
    "we focus on these two spin relaxation processes , inherent for multiple quantum wells and limiting the spin relaxation time there .",
    "we demonstrate here that in symmetric multiple quantum well structures grown along the @xmath1 $ ] axis , extremely long spin lifetimes , up to @xmath2  ns can be achieved at low temperatures .",
    "these times exceed significantly the experimental values reported in the literature .",
    "we discuss the origin of such a discrepancy and find that even a very weak asymmetry of the quantum well structure can bring the spin lifetimes to the experimentally observed values .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we introduce the quantum well structure of interest and study the role of the screening due to the presence of several quantum wells filled with mobile electrons . in the third section we study the spin relaxation due to the random rashba field of screened donors as a function of temperature . in the fourth section",
    "we investigate the temperature - dependent effect of collisions of electrons from different quantum wells on the spin relaxation and compare the spin relaxation rates due to both effects . in conclusions",
    "we summarize the results and discuss possible experimental observations of the effects considered in this paper .",
    "in fig . 1(a ) we present a scheme of a typical multiple quantum well structure : relatively thin conducting layers separated by wide barriers .",
    "such a structure is similar to the one studied in ref .",
    "[ ] . to reduce the structure asymmetry - induced rashba field , each quantum well is located in a macroscopically symmetric environment .",

    "the central and the side quantum wells are separated by the distance @xmath3 typically on the order of 50 - 100 nm .",

    "1 maintains macroscopic symmetry with respect to the @xmath5 reflection .",
    "the central and the side wells are filled with conduction electrons .",
    "the screening due to the redistribution of these electrons strongly reduces the electric field of the donor ions in the wells .",
    "we assume that the quantum wells are sufficiently narrow and can be considered as zero - width conducting layers.@xcite    the fluctuating rashba field caused by the ionized donors and the electrons in the side wells is proportional to the @xmath6-component of the electric field caused by the charges . as a result",
    ", it depends strongly on how this field is screened .",
    "electrons are free to move in the quantum well plane but can not move along the growth direction , making screening of the @xmath7axis and lateral field components drastically different . in a narrow single quantum",

    "we investigated the electron spin relaxation in a symmetric three - layer gaas ( 110 ) quantum well structure , which can be considered as a building element for larger multiple quantum well structures .",
    "since the dresselhaus spin - orbit term in these systems is proportional to @xmath128 , the @xmath6-component of the spin demonstrates a very long lifetime . the spin relaxation can appear due to the random rashba spin - orbit coupling resulting from the electric field of donors providing electrons for the quantum wells filling .",
    "the screening of the coulomb interaction by the degenerate gas of conduction electrons strongly suppresses the field of the ions and the corresponding random rashba field . as a result , the spin relaxation time for an appropriately chosen geometry increases by at least an order of magnitude compared to a single symmetric quantum well .",
    "another effect important in these structures is the non spin conserving electron - electron collision , having the same physical reason as the spin - flip scattering by charge donors , that is the local rashba field induced by the electric field of a charge located near a quantum well .",
    "the contribution of electron - electron collisions is suppressed by the pauli principle at low temperatures , where the electron gas is strongly degenerated , being much smaller than the contribution of the ions . at high temperatures ,",

    "two other wells can be in a strongly asymmetric environment , and , therefore , demonstrate a conventional relatively fast spin relaxation due to the regular rashba field . in the multiple quantum wells structures containing many single layers , only edge wells are in the asymmetric environment .",
    "therefore , very long spin relaxation times can be achieved for the most of the electrons in the system .    these times",
    "can be estimated taking into account that for the low temperatures the main contribution comes from the ions .",

    "the experiment reveals the times an order of magnitude shorter.@xcite the difference can be related to the nonprecise information about the material and structure - dependent parameters and possible structure asymmetry resulting in a very weak but regular rashba field on the spatial scale comparable or larger than the electron free path .",
    "for the single - electron momentum relaxation time @xmath134 on the order of 1 ps , it is sufficient to have a very small spin splitting at the fermi level on the order of 0.01 mev to ensure the times observed in the experiment.@xcite the contributions of the random and the regular rashba mechanisms can be separated by studying the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate at the temperatures @xmath135 , where , however , the single electron momentum relaxation time is already determined by the electron - electron collisions rather than by the disorder . in this case , the pure random rashba field mechanism would result in a very weak @xmath78-dependence , while the regular one would lead to a @xmath136 decrease .    at these momentum relaxation times",
    "@xmath134 , typical for @xmath78 on the order of 10 - 20 k , the electron free path is larger than five interwell distances .",
    "therefore , if the expectation value of the rashba field is zero , at these temperatures electron spin indeed experiences only fluctuations of the rashba field around its zero mean value . with the temperature increase ,",
