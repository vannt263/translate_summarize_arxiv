    "the distances cited above should be interpreted cautiously , irrespective of the aforementioned discrepancy . the type ii cepheid estimate _ presently _ exhibits small statistics and large uncertainties , as expected .",
    "the distances computed for the classical cepheids exhibit a dependence on colour and ccd chip (  [ asources ] , fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "additional concerns arise because that population is amongst the most obscured in the extragalactic sample (  [ asources ] ) .",
    "it has been argued that metal - rich classical cepheids may exhibit a shallower ( & steeper ) wesenheit slope than metal - poor ones , thereby introducing a potential source of uncertainty into the present analysis since the chemical composition of the cepheids in ngc 5128 is unknown .",
    "however , a plot of the wesenheit slopes inferred from ground - based observations of classical cepheids in the milky way , lmc , ngc 6822 , smc , and ic 1613 , demonstrates that the galaxies are characterized by a common _ vi _ slope over a sizeable abundance baseline ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath9 & @xmath10[fe / h]@xmath11 ) .",
    "the slope of the _ vi _ wesenheit function is therefore insensitive to metallicity to within the uncertainties .",
    "the contrasting interpretations and evidence presented by @xcite and @xcite should be considered .        the galactic calibration employed to secure the distance to ngc 5128 and construct figure  [ fig2 ] is based in part on @xcite hst parallaxes for 10 nearby classical cepheids , which anchored the milky way calibration .",
    "@xcite questioned the reliability of the hst parallaxes since the resulting period-@xmath31 relations inferred from that sample do not match their functions @xcite , which were constructed from the best available data at the time .",
    "their relations were derived prior to the publication of the hst parallaxes and the parameters for longer - period classical cepheids tied to galactic associations have since been revised @xcite , although continued work is needed to secure new calibrators and revise existing ones .",
    "the implied assertion that the hst parallaxes are awry is not supported by the results of @xcite or figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "a central conclusion of @xcite was that the classical cepheid period - luminosity relation tied to the hst sample is in agreement with that inferred from cluster cepheids .",
    "moreover , the slope of the _ vi _ wesenheit function inferred from the hst parallaxes matches that of ground - based observations of classical cepheids in the lmc , ngc 6822 , smc , and ic 1613 ( fig .",

    "the reader is likewise referred to the research of @xcite        @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest that the classical cepheid _ vi _ wesenheit relation exhibits a zero - point dependence on metallicity ( see also the review of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , again introducing a potential source of uncertainty into the present analysis since the chemical composition of the cepheids in ngc 5128 is unknown .",
    "the aforementioned researchers endeavoured to ascertain the influence of chemical composition by examining the distance offset between classical cepheids located in the central ( metal - rich ) and outer ( metal - poor ) regions of a particular galaxy ( m101 , m106 , m33 ) .",
    "however , a degeneracy emerges ( photometric contamination ) since the stellar density and surface brightness often increase toward the central region .",
    "@xcite noted that a substantial fraction of the difference in distance moduli between classical cepheids occupying the inner and outer regions of m101 could arise from blending .",
    "@xcite and @xcite employed criteria to mitigate the impact of photometric contamination so to enable an unbiased determination of the classical cepheid metallicity effect from observations of classical cepheids in m106 and m33 , and the reader is encouraged to consider their evidence . yet",
    "the result inferred from variables in m106 was provided an alternative rationale by @xcite and @xcite , who noted that the observed offset was too large to be attributed to variations in chemical composition .",
    "indeed , @xcite abundance gradient for m106 implies that initial estimates of the classical cepheid metallicity effect ( @xmath33 mag dex@xmath34 ) nearly double ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , or see table 12 in * ? ? ?",
    "a comparably sizeable result is obtained when examining the offset between @xcite distance to classical cepheids occupying the inner region of m101 and @xcite distance to classical cepheids in the outer region of that same galaxy , which sample metal - rich and metal - poor variables accordingly ( @xmath35 mag dex@xmath34 , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the results for m101 and m106 are larger than that cited for m33 ( @xmath36 mag dex@xmath34 ) .",
    "the results differ in yet another manner , namely that the slope of the _ vi _ wesenheit function inferred from classical cepheids sampling the inner region of m106 differs from the outer region , while the classical cepheids of m33 ( inner & outer ) exhibit a comparable slope .",
    "the discrepancies are manifold and the proposed metallicity effect is nonetheless too large .",
    "the sizeable distance offset between the inner and outer regions of the galaxies arises from photometric contamination and other source(s ) .",
    "consider the following example , in tandem with the results of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which compares the distances to classical cepheids and rr lyrae variables at a common zero - point ( e.g. , lmc , smc , and ic 1613 ) .",
    "the _ vi _ wesenheit functions inferred from ogle lmc classical cepheids and rr lyrae variables are adopted as the calibrating set @xcite .",
    "rr lyrae variables likewise follow scatter reduced _ vi _ wesenheit functions @xcite . the distance offset between classical cepheids and rr lyrae variables in the smc as established via the ogle lmc wesenheit relations is : @xmath37 ( fig .  [ fig7 ] ) . the distance offset between classical cepheids and rr lyrae variables in ic 1613 as established via the ogle lmc wesenheit relations is : @xmath38 ( fig .  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the distances inferred from the standard candles agree to within the uncertainties , despite the neglect of metallicity corrections for variable types sampling different temperature , radius , and density regimes .",
    "hence the evidence does not support a sizeable metallicity effect .",
    "the comparison between the variable types is independent of zero - point and uncertainties tied to extinction corrections .",
    "admittedly , additional _ vi _ observations of extragalactic rr lyrae variables are desirable and the wesenheit function characterizing that population as inferred from pulsation models , the magellanic clouds , and globular clusters are marginally discrepant @xcite . further work is needed .    in sum , metallicity",

    "therefore , concerns are allayed pertaining to chemical composition being a sizeable source of uncertainty tied to the cepheid distance for ngc 5128 , or the establishment of the hubble constant .",

    "alternate sources that may explain the discrepancy between the cepheid distance to ngc 5128 and independent indicators are now considered .",
    "of particular concern is the correlation between the computed distances to classical cepheids in ngc 5128 , their colours , and the sampling ccd ( fig .",

    "the origin of the bias may be manifold .",
    "the excess reddening detected for a sizeable fraction of the classical cepheids in ngc 5128 may be an indication of photometric contamination ( fig .",

    "the photometric errors inherent to extragalactic observations , in addition to internal differential reddening , exacerbate the perceived spread .",
    "period - color relations shall yield negative reddenings for cepheids on the cool edge of the strip that are observed through negligible extinction , yet the mean for an entire sample of classical cepheids should be null within the uncertainties owing to the even distribution of variables within the strip @xcite .",
    "suspicion should be cast upon photometry ( & the period - colour relations employed ) which yield a mean extinction significantly less than the foreground estimate ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . also note that classical cepheids observed in remote galaxies are preferentially the brightest ( massive ) , and may be tied to star forming regions immersed in obscuring material ( longer period classical cepheids trace spiral arms : e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "photometric contamination , which may preferentially affect fainter short period cepheids relative to brighter long period ones ( e.g. , fig .  17 in * ? ? ?",
