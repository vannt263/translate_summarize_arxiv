    "we compare our results with those in @xcite and @xcite . for complementary sectors ( and extensions of these ) we give an expansion in terms of the modified bessel function @xmath12 and its derivative .",
    "in fact , this is an expansion in terms of @xmath13 , and this expansion holds for all @xmath5 . in the appendix  [ sec : modbes ] we summarize the expansions of the modified bessel functions .",
    "these expansions play a role when comparing the results for the generalized bessel polynomials with those for @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath9 the generalized bessel polynomials become well - known polynomials that occur in representations of bessel functions of fractional order .",

    "more terms in this expansion can be obtained , for example by using the cauchy integral given in .    in this section",
    "we derive a simple asymptotic expansion related to the result in by expanding part of the integrand in in powers of @xmath39 .",
