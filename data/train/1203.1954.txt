    "the r@xmath15le of the @xmath14 hyperon in stabilizing nuclear cores was pointed out long ago by dalitz and levi setti @xcite as part of a discussion focusing on light hypernuclei with large neutron excess .",
    "this property is demonstrated by the observation of @xmath0he , @xmath16be , @xmath17he , @xmath18be and @xmath19b hypernuclei in emulsion experiments @xcite .",
    "no unstable - core hydrogen @xmath14 hypernuclei have been established so far , although the existence of the lightest possible one @xmath0h was predicted by dalitz and levi setti @xcite and subsequently reinforced in estimates by majling @xcite .",
    "the neutral - baryon excess in @xmath0h , in particular , would be @xmath20 , with @xmath21 for a @xmath14 hyperon , larger than the maximal value in light nuclei , @xmath22 for @xmath23he @xcite .",
    "neutron - rich light hypernuclei could thus go beyond the neutron drip line for ordinary nuclear systems .",
    "two - body reactions in which neutron rich hypernuclei could be produced are the following double charge - exchange reactions : @xmath24 induced on nuclear targets by stopped @xmath25 mesons or in flight , and @xmath26 with @xmath5 mesons in flight ( @xmath27 gev / c ) .",
    "the simplest description of the above reactions is a two - step process on two different protons of the same nucleus , converting them into a neutron and a @xmath14 , with the additional condition that the final nuclear system is bound . for ( [ prodk ] )",
    "it amounts to @xmath28 reaction followed by @xmath29 or @xmath30 followed by @xmath31 , for ( [ prodpi ] ) to a @xmath32 reaction followed by @xmath33 or @xmath34 followed by @xmath35 .",
    "another mechanism is a single - step double charge exchange @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 stands for meson ) feeding the @xmath38 component coherently admixed into the final @xmath14 hypernuclear state .",
    "such admixtures are essentially equivalent to invoking a second step of @xmath39 conversion .",
    "these two - step processes are expected to occur at a much lower rate ( reduction factor @xmath40 @xcite ) than the production of normal @xmath14 hypernuclei by means of the corresponding single - step two - body reactions ( @xmath41 ) and ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the first experimental attempt to produce neutron - rich hypernuclei by the reaction ( [ prodk ] ) with @xmath25 at rest was carried out at kek @xcite .",
    "upper limits were obtained for the production of @xmath18he , @xmath43be and @xmath44c hypernuclei ( on @xmath45be , @xmath46c and @xmath47o targets respectively ) in the range of @xmath48 , while the theoretical predictions for @xmath43be and @xmath44c @xcite lie in the interval @xmath49 , which is at least one order of magnitude lower than the experimental upper limits and three orders of magnitude smaller than the standard one - step ( @xmath50 ) reaction rates on the same targets ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "another kek experiment @xcite reported the observation of @xmath19li in the ( @xmath52 ) reaction on a @xmath53b target with a 1.2 gev / c @xmath5 beam .",
    "a production cross section of @xmath54 nb / sr was evaluated ; the result , however , is not directly comparable with theoretical calculations @xcite since no discrete structure was observed and the production cross section was integrated over the whole bound region ( @xmath55 mev ) .",
    "a further attempt to observe neutron - rich hypernuclei by means of the reaction ( [ prodk ] ) , with @xmath25 at rest , was made at the da@xmath1ne collider at lnf by the finuda experiment @xcite , on @xmath4li and @xmath56li targets .",
    "the limited data sample collected during the first run period of the experiment was used to estimate the production rates per stopped @xmath25 of @xmath0h and @xmath16h .",
    "the inclusive @xmath2 spectra from @xmath4li and @xmath56li targets were analyzed in momentum regions corresponding , through momentum and energy conservation , to @xmath57 values discussed in the literature .",
    "because of the dominant contribution of the reactions @xmath58 and @xmath59 which give the main component of the inclusive @xmath2 spectra for absorption of stopped @xmath25 mesons on nuclei , and owing to a limited statistics , only upper limits could be evaluated for @xmath14 hypernuclear production : @xmath60 in addition to an upper limit determined in @xmath46c : @xmath61 lowering by a factor @xmath62 the previous kek determination @xcite .    in this article",
    "we present the analysis of the total data sample of the finuda experiment , collected from 2003 to 2007 and corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 1156 pb@xmath63 , aiming at assessing the existence of @xmath0h and determining the production rate by means of the ( @xmath3 ) reaction on @xmath4li targets . a preliminary account of the results , reporting three clear events of @xmath0h , appeared in @xcite .     relative to the summed mass of @xmath8 , @xmath64 mev , with the ( blue in the web version ) hatched box denoting the width of @xmath10h @xcite .",

    "we recall that the binding energy @xmath57 of hypernucleus @xmath68z is defined as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mass of the @xmath71z core nucleus in its ground state ( g.s . ) , as deduced from the atomic mass tables @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10h nuclear core , colloquially termed  superheavy hydrogen \" , was observed as a broad resonance ( 1.9 mev fwhm ) at energy about 1.7 mev above the @xmath11 threshold @xcite .",
    "a substantially stronger binding , @xmath72 mev , was predicted by akaishi et al .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath73 g.s . on the basis of a coherent @xmath74 mixing model originally practised for the @xmath75h cluster @xcite .",

    "if this prediction is respected by nature , it could imply far - reaching consequences to strange dense stellar matter .    in the next sections we describe briefly the finuda experimental apparatus , and the analysis technique applied to the data collected on @xmath4li targets .",
    "we then report on three @xmath0h candidate events found by observing @xmath80 mesons from production and @xmath81 mesons from decay in coincidence .",
    "these events prove robust against varying the cuts selected in the analysis , and give evidence for a particle stable @xmath0h .",
    "the measurement background is evaluated and the production rate of @xmath0h is estimated .",
    "we end with a brief discussion of the @xmath0h excitation spectrum as constrained by the three candidate events .",
    "finuda was a hypernuclear physics experiment installed at one of the two interaction regions of the da@xmath1ne @xmath82 collider , the infn - lnf @xmath1(1020)-factory .",
    "a detailed description of the experimental apparatus can be found in ref .",
    "the layout figured a cylindrical symmetry arrangement ; here we briefly sketch its main components moving outwards from the beam axis : the _ interaction / target region _ , composed by a barrel of 12 thin scintillator slabs ( tofino ) , surrounded by an octagonal array of @xmath83 microstrips ( isim ) facing eight target tiles ; the _ tracking device _ , consisting of four layers of position sensitive detectors ( a decagonal array of @xmath83 microstrips ( osim ) , two octagonal layers of low mass drift chambers ( lmdc ) and a stereo system of straw tubes ( st ) ) arranged in coaxial geometry ; the _ external time of flight detector _ ( tofone ) , a barrel of 72 scintillator slabs .",
    "the whole apparatus was placed inside a uniform 1.0 t solenoidal magnetic field ; the tracking volume was immersed in @xmath84 atmosphere to minimize the multiple scattering effect .",
    "the main features of the apparatus were the thinness of the target materials needed to stop the low energy ( @xmath85 16 mev ) @xmath25 s from the @xmath86 decay channel , the high transparency of the finuda tracker and the very large solid angle ( @xmath87 sr ) covered by the detector ensemble ; accordingly , the finuda apparatus was suitable to study simultaneously the formation and the decay of @xmath14 hypernuclei by means of high resolution magnetic spectroscopy of the emitted charged particles .    in particular , for @xmath2 with momentum @xmath88",
    "mev / c the resolution of the tracker can be evaluated by measuring the width of the momentum distribution of the monochromatic ( 235.6 mev / c ) @xmath89 coming from the @xmath90 decay channel ; for reactions occurring in the apparatus sector where @xmath4li targets were located , it is @xmath91 mev / c @xcite ; the precision on the absolute momentum calibration , obtained from the mean value of the same distribution , is better than 0.12 mev / c for the @xmath4li targets , which corresponds to a maximum systematic uncertainty in the kinetic energy @xmath92 mev .     from @xmath4li targets .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the distribution for low momentum @xmath5 from @xmath4li targets , before acceptance correction ; the spectrum is fitted in the 120140 mev / c momentum range ( continuous black curve ) with the sum of a second degree polynomial , representing the background from quasi - free @xmath14 decay and quasi - free @xmath95 production ( dashed ( red in the web version ) curve in the figure ) , and a gaussian function representing the @xmath75h mesonic decay contribution ( dot - dashed ( blue in the web version ) curve ) ; the fit gives a @xmath96 , a mean @xmath97 mev / c and a standard deviation @xmath98 mev / c for the gaussian function , directly measuring the experimental resolution .",
    "for comparison , @xmath99 mev / c from @xmath100 mev , as determined from emulsion studies @xcite ; hence the absolute uncertainty is 0.2 mev / c .",
    "and the corresponding systematic uncertainty in the kinetic energy is then @xmath101 mev .    to perform particle identification ,",
    "the information of the specific energy loss in both osim and the lmdc s is used ; the mass identification from the time of flight system ( tofino - tofone ) for high momentum tracks is also used .",
    "the final selection is performed by requiring the same identification from at least two different detectors .",
    "in the second data taking the statistics collected with @xmath4li targets was improved by a factor 5 with respect to the first run . however , even with the improved statistics , we could not observe in the inclusive @xmath2 spectra clear peaks that could be attributed to the two - body reaction : @xmath102 exploiting the increased statistics , we tried then to reduce the background overwhelming the events from reaction ( [ nrich6lh ] ) by examining the spectra of @xmath2 in coincidence with the @xmath5 coming from the mesonic decay of @xmath0h : @xmath103 the branching ratio for ( [ 6lhmwd ] ) is expected to be about 50@xmath104 taking into account the value measured for the analogous decay @xmath105 @xcite .",
