    "the nonlinear dynamics behavior of pipes conveying fluid displays interesting and paradigmatic behavior with important practical implications and it offers a rich setting for development and testing of nonlinear dynamics theory .",
    "bifurcation theory represents one of the main subject areas of nonlinear dynamics , analyzing behavior either in the vicinity of trivial solutions ( local bifurcations ) , or the existence in - the - large of connected sets of non - trivial solutions ( global bifurcations ) . in the study of local bifurcations , particularly interesting is the influence of various parameters figuring in the governing equations on the location and stability of fixed points and on classification of bifurcations as supercritical or subcritical . in a supercritical bifurcation",
    "there is no discontinuous change in size and form of the attractor , and after the bifurcation the new ( enlarged ) attractor contains within itself the old attractor . on the other hand , in subcritical bifurcation",
    "the attractor disappears followed by a jump of the system to a remote and completely new attractor , via a fast dynamic transient . for the complete understanding of the dynamics , both stationary and nonstationary ( dynamic ) aspects of the bifurcation theory",
    "are important .    in the case of fluid - conveying pipes ,",
    "nonstationary analysis is related to the study of supercritical and subcritical hopf bifurcations , the determination of the amplitude associated with flutter and the dependence of oscillation frequency on the amplitude .",
    "stationary analysis , on the other hand , is concerned with stationary bifurcations i.e. changes in the equilibrium point structure of the underlying equations , which due to reflection symmetry are of pitchfork type .",
    "furthermore interplay between stationary and dynamic bifurcations may lead to more complicated dynamics such as spatio - temporal intermittency and chaos ( argentina and collet , 1998 ) . in spite of many publications devoted to these subjects , a thorough and systematic analysis of nonlinear models of fluid conveying pipes , particularly of pipes supported at both ends , and related bifurcations is still lacking . following the pioneering works by holmes ( 1977 , 1978 ) further work of interest appeared in chng ( 1977 , 1979 ) and lunn ( 1982 ) . as a paradigm of the studies performed so far , the work of holmes based on the center manifold analysis concentrated on one - equation model which does not take into account any gravitational nor tensioning effects .",
    "the coefficients figuring in the normal form of the obtained bifurcation equation were given only as numerical values , disguising the influence of involved physical quantities .",
    "finally , the complete two - equation model of paidoussis ( 2003 ) has only recently been introduced in its correct form and it has never been used .",
    "a wealth of up - to - date information related to the published works on nonlinear aspects of fluid - conveying pipes with supported ends may be found in paidoussis ( 1998 , 2003 ) .    in order to improve upon the current status and in order to prepare the ground for the study of spatio - temporal intermittency ( and chaos ) , we study several well - known and frequently used nonlinear models in which we focus on nondegenerate local bifurcations from the trivial solution to another stationary nontrivial solution . in particular , the object of our analysis are pipes fixed at both ends shown in fig . 1 and nonlinear models of holmes ( 1977 ) , thurman and mote ( 1969 ) and the complete nonlinear model of paidoussis ( 2002 ) , [ the latter being based on the model of semler at al . ( 1994 ) ] .",
    "the manner of presentation is such that each model is considered as a special case of the complete nonlinear model , revealing the influence on the complete dynamics of different linear and nonlinear terms and quantities .",
    "moreover the increasing complexity of each model leads to a better understanding of the complete nonlinear model .",
    "each model is presented in a separate section of the paper , with subsections related to certain important parameters influencing the dynamics , such as the gravitational force or pipe curvature .",
    "since this exposition relies strongly on the lyapunov - schmidt reduction , a brief description of the procedure is presented in appendix a. the interested reader may be find extensive treatment in books ( golubitsky et al . , 1985 ;",
    "golubitsky and schaeffer , 1988 ) . an important characteristic of the lyapunov - schmidt reduction is that the procedure for obtaining normal form of the bifurcation equation is pursued by analytical means , without using any numerical or truncating procedures .",
    "hence the normal form is exact and influence of each parameter on the type of bifurcation may be traced and analyzed .",
    "an important insight gained by using this method is reflected in the fact that we obtain exact analytical solutions in the vicinity of bifurcation point for each model and derive exact conditions that classify bifurcations as supercritical or subcritical .",
    "holmes considered pipes with supported , non - sliding ends and obtained a nonlinear equation of motion by adding to a linear equation the nonlinear term corresponding to the mean , deformation - induced tensioning .",

    "we have shown here that the sign of these terms is unalterable and we have presented their analytical form . applying the lyapunov - schmidt reduction to the same stationary equation and taking applied tension into account , the following normal form of the bifurcation equation is obtained:@xmath37 \\text { } \\mu ^{3}-(n\\pi ) ^{3}\\text { } \\mu \\rho + \\vartheta ( 3)=0 .",

    "a comparison with corresponding inequalities for the thurman and mote model which includes curvature effects , shows that the pressure term replaces the velocity - dependent term .",
    "the reason is that the pressure term acts the same as the velocity term and it is clear that an adequately high level of pressurization alone may cause supercritical bifurcation . for pipes made of elastic material , gravity effects are important , as are the effects of axial flexibility , so that a supercritical bifurcation is more probable in shorter pipes . intuitively , short pipes acquire a buckled shape in an evolutionary manner ( corresponding to the supercritical case ) , while longer pipes suddenly deform ( corresponding to the subcritical case ) . for long pipes tensioning term",

    "clearly @xmath245 and it is easy to notice that the sign of @xmath246 does not depend on signs of j@xmath247 and j@xmath248 since the term containing these two bessel functions is much smaller then the other two terms .",

    "bifurcation is possible only if pressurization term is small compared to axial flexibility , since the corresponding condition may be written as@xmath254 in the above expression a viscoelastic material has been considered , and since we are considering a time independent model , axial tension is @xmath255where averaged axial strain @xmath256 due to lateral deflections @xmath93 is @xmath257the other possibility for this low velocity case , @xmath258 @xmath259 has no physical meaning since @xmath120 is small .",
    "although a subtle interplay between system parameters requires careful analysis under specific circumstances of interest , in general it may be concluded that in the case of high fluid velocity a supercritical bifurcation is more likely in a short pipe , while a subcritical bifurcation is more probable in a long pipe ( provided that appropriate inequalities ( 61 ) and ( [ 62 ] ) are fulfilled ) . in the case of low fluid velocities ( along with @xmath260",
    "the situation is the opposite : a supercritical bifurcation is more likely in a long pipe , while subcritical bifurcation is preferred in short pipes provided condition ( [ 69 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "exact analytical solutions in the vicinity of bifurcation point for each model are obtained along with the derivation of conditions that classify bifurcations as supercritical or subcritical . moreover ,",
    "the analysis is performed in such a manner that influence of important quantities on the dynamics of supported fluid conveying pipes may be analyzed in the light of increasing complexity of each model .",
    "two important features of the stationary bifurcations for the supported fluid - conveying pipes should be emphasized .",
    "first , all bifurcations are of the pitchfork type as a consequence of reflection symmetry .",
    "second , all perturbations of the pitchfork bifurcation , due to gravity or curvature effects for example , preserve the topological form of the unperturbed bifurcating diagram , due to the fact that 0 remains the solution of the perturbed equation .",
    "consequently , unfolding of the bifurcation does not take place which requires that 0 is not the solution of the perturbed equation .",
    "models that consider both axial and lateral deflections , hence two - equation models , enable the possibility of both supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations .",
    "in contrast , the single equation model of holmes which considers just transverse deflections allows only supercritical bifurcations .",
    "an important general characteristic of classification of generic codimension-1 bifurcations into supercritical or subcritical is that the bifurcation type depends on only two factors : nonlinear terms and boundary conditions .",
    "hence , nonlinear terms figuring in the equation for axial deflections make an important contribution to the terms defining the normal form of the bifurcation equation .    in the complete nonlinear model of paidoussis",
    "critical velocity values at which bifurcation occurs depend on tension , gravity and pressure . for @xmath261 gravity and tensioning exert matching effects reflected in shifting bifurcation values in the positive direction with the shift due to gravity being one - half the corresponding tensioning shift .",
    "the effects of pressurization oppose effects of gravity and tension . for @xmath193",
    "gravity and pressurization act in the same direction , while tensioning exerts opposing effect .",
    "the critical velocity values for each model are presented in table 1 .",
    "a summary of conditions classifying bifurcations as supercritical and subcritical is presented in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "an increase of complexity of the bifurcation type conditions may be traced , starting with the least complex model of thurman and mote and ending with the complete nonlinear model of paidoussis .",
    "the velocity - dependent term appearing in inequalities corresponding to the thurman and mote model with curvature transforms into an analogous pressurizing effect in the most complex model . setting @xmath262 and assuming that @xmath2 and @xmath263 are independent of the pipe length in the complete nonlinear model of paidoussis , one obtains classification conditions for the thurman and mote model .",
    "although conditions for determining whether bifurcation is of supercritical or subcritical type involve a delicate interaction among system parameters ( gravity effects , tensioning , pressurization and axial flexibility ) , it may be concluded that a general tendency is that for high fluid velocities supercritical bifurcation is more likely in short pipes , while subcritical is more likely in longer pipes ( provided that appropriate inequalities ( [ 61 ] ) and ( [ 62 ] ) are satisfied ) .",
    "when the fluid velocity is low ,  but still high enough that the square of it exceeds axial flexibility , a supercritical bifurcation is more likely in longer pipes ( with conditions ( [ 67 ] ) and ( [ 68 ] ) in effect ) , while a subcritical bifurcation may occur in short pipes provided that condition ( [ 69 ] ) is satisfied .",
