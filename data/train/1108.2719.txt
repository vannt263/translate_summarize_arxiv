    "m dwarfs are main sequence stars whose spectra display bands of tio and other molecules such as cah , vo , feh , and crh @xcite .",
    "the high molecular opacities are the result of a cool atmosphere with effective temperatures in the range 2400k-3700k @xcite . observed orbital motion of astrometric binaries @xcite",
    "show that m dwarfs have masses ranging from @xmath50.5 m@xmath6 all the way down to the hydrogen - burning limit ( @xmath50.075 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "m dwarfs have relatively small sizes , with radii roughly proportional to their masses .",
    "recent measurements of eclipsing systems @xcite indicate a roughly linear relationship between masses and radii , with a 0.4 m@xmath6 ( 0.1 m@xmath6 ) m dwarf having a radius of 0.4 r@xmath6 ( 0.15 r@xmath6 ) . by number ,",
    "m dwarfs form the bulk of the stars in our galaxy .",
    "the census of stars within 33 parsecs of the sun @xcite shows m dwarfs outnumbering all other hydrogen - burning objects by a factor of three to one .",
    "because of their low mass - to - light ratio , m dwarfs contribute only a small fraction of the light emission in galaxies , but they may be the dominant baryonic component in at least some galaxies @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been an increasing interest in m dwarfs due to the discovery that they too host exoplanets . as of january 2011 , 25% of the 41 doppler - confirmed planets with @xmath730m@xmath8 are orbiting m dwarfs .",
    "the geneva / harps planet search team reports that @xmath930% of low - mass stars harbor planets with masses @xmath030@xmath10 on orbits shorter than 50  d @xcite and preliminary _ kepler _ results suggest that m dwarfs host just as many , if not more , super - earths and neptunes as solar - mass stars @xcite .",
    "exoplanet candidates have been identified by _ kepler _ in stars having colors consistent with m dwarfs @xcite , despite the fact that very few m dwarfs are being targeted by the mission @xcite .",
    "large exoplanet surveys have now started to monitor sizable numbers of m dwarfs , such as the m2k program which is targeting some 1,600 m dwarfs for radial velocity monitoring @xcite , and the mearth project @xcite which is designed to detect exoplanet transits in nearby late - type m dwarfs .",
    "the two principal methods of exoplanet detection , doppler measurement of radial velocity ( rv ) and photometric detection of transits , are more sensitive to planets around stars of lower mass . for a given planet mass and orbital period , rv amplitude scales as @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast to late - type m stars , the vast majority of early m dwarfs are not rapid rotators or chromospherically active ( w@xmath12 ) @xcite and are thus amenable to these search techniques .",
    "in fact , inactive k and early m stars have weaker p - mode oscillations and lower doppler noise ( `` jitter '' ) than their f or g counterparts @xcite .",
    "photometric transit depth scales approximately as @xmath13 for planets of similar size .",
    "because of their significantly smaller radii , m dwarfs display deeper transits which do not require high precision photometry for detection , as they do for g stars @xcite .",
    "another method of planet detection is high - contrast imaging at infrared wavelengths where a ( giant ) planet is self - luminous @xcite .",
    "m dwarf systems present a much more favorable planet / star contrast ratio compared to solar - mass stars , due to the significantly lower luminosity of m dwarfs .",
    "young systems are of particular interest because the luminosity of giant planets is predicted to be orders of magnitude higher at ages of @xmath14  yr @xcite providing a more favorable contrast , even as the host star itself is moderately more luminous at this younger age .",
    "young solar mass stars can be identified by their enhanced rotation , dynamo activity , and chromospheric emission @xcite , although the trend for late m stars for which the mechanism of dynamo operation is thought to be different is less clear @xcite .",
    "another challenge for this approach is the apparent rarity of giant planets on long - period orbits around solar - mass stars @xcite combined with the paucity of giant planets around m dwarfs compared to g dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that young giant planets may be less luminous and more difficult to detect than previously predicted @xcite .",
    "low luminosity m dwarfs are also attractive targets because planets within their diminutive habitable zones are easier to detect @xcite .",
    "the correlation between high metallicity and the presence of giant planets found among solar - mass stars @xcite has been recently extended to m dwarf stars @xcite , and metal - rich m dwarfs , if they can be identified @xcite , would be especially propitious targets for planet searches .",
    "despite the attractiveness of m dwarfs for exoplanet surveys , there still is no systematic , all - sky census of these objects to a useful limiting magnitude .",
    "part of the problem is that the low - mass m dwarfs are stars of relatively low luminosities ( m@xmath15 ) .",
    "all but the closest m dwarfs are too faint ( v@xmath912 ) to be part of the _ hipparcos _ catalog @xcite , which means that existing m dwarf samples are selected from proper motion catalogs with fainter magnitude limits .",
    "these include the tycho-2 catalogue @xcite , which extends the hipparcos catalog a few magnitudes fainter , and also the older and deeper luyten half second ( lhs ) and new luyten two - tenths ( nltt ) catalogs",
    "@xcite which were the primary source material for the well - known _ catalog of nearby stars _ @xcite .",
    "newer and more complete proper motion catalogs , such as the lspm - north @xcite have the potential to expand the list of available m dwarf targets .    in this paper , we present the first all - sky catalog of bright ( j@xmath010 ) m dwarfs .",
    "the sample is extracted from the all - sky superblink proper motion catalog of stars with @xmath140 mas yr@xmath2 , an extension of lspm - north currently in development .",
    "the selection method is detailed in  2 .",
    "the catalog itself is presented in  3 .",
    "the completeness of the catalog is evaluated in  4 .",
    "conclusions follow in  5 .",
    "the superblink proper motion survey is an all - sky search for stars with large proper motions based on a re - analysis of images from the digitized sky surveys ( dss ) using a specialized image - differencing algorithm and software .",
    "the basic search method is described in @xcite .",
    "quality control procedures , including cross - correlation with other catalogs and the compilation of astrometric and photometric results , is discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "stringent quality control procedures , including visual confirmation of most objects , guarantees a very low level of false detections .",
    "the survey has a fixed , low proper motion threshold of @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "new stars with very large proper motions ( @xmath17 mas yr@xmath2 ) discovered in the survey have been published in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a complete list of northern stars with proper motions @xmath18 mas yr@xmath2 was published in @xcite ; a similar list covering the southern sky has been completed and is available from the authors .",
    "those complete lists incorporate data from the hipparcos and tycho-2 catalogs at the bright end , and the catalogs are estimated to be @xmath19 complete to a visual magnitude @xmath20 , and extend to @xmath21 .",
    "the completeness is significantly higher at high galactic latitudes , where field crowding is less of an issue .",
    "dense fields at low galactic latitudes have a lower completeness due to faint stars often being lost to non - linearity in the crowded areas of photographic plates ; saturation also prevents the detection of proper motion sources in the extended glare ( up to several arc minutes ) of extremely bright stars ( e.g. vega , sirius , canopus ) .    as of july 2011 ,",
    "the full superblink catalog ( stars with proper motions @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 ) comprised 2,270,481 objects , with the most extensive sky coverage north of decl.=-20@xmath22 .",
    "the catalog was complete for the northern sky ( decl.@xmath90@xmath22 ) , but the survey was still in progress for large parts of the southern sky .",
    "the southern survey was however complete for stars with proper motions @xmath18 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "this version of the superblink catalog is the one used here .",
    "the use of a proper motion catalog is a convenient way to identify nearby stars in general , and m dwarfs in particular , because proper motion - selected samples discriminate against distant background sources including m giants that would otherwise significantly contaminate a sample of cool stars selected by color alone .",
    "however , proper motion selection carries its own inherent bias : stars with small velocities in the plane of the sky tend not to be detected in proper motion surveys , depending on the distance to the source .",
    "nearby , slow - moving stars can be included by lowering the proper motion limit of the sample , but this has the effect of increasing the contamination from background sources . there is a fine balance to achieve in adjusting the proper motion threshold , which would ideally have the sample incorporate the largest possible fraction of stars up to a specified distance , minimizing the kinematic bias , while at the same time limiting the contamination from background objects .",
    "the superblink catalog , with a proper motion limit @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 , achieves such a balance for stars located within 100 parsecs of the sun .",
    "this can be demonstrated with an analysis of proper motion in the _ hipparcos _ catalog .",
    "figure 1 shows the fraction of hipparcos stars at a given distance from the sun which have proper motions @xmath18 mas yr@xmath2 and @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "the former value is the proper motion limit of the lspm - north and south catalogs ( which is also the approximate proper motion limit of the nltt catalog and , by extension , the catalog of nearby stars ) , while the latter is the proper motion limit of the extended superblink catalog .",
    "the diagram shows that operating with a proper motion limit of @xmath18 mas yr@xmath2 will only detect half the stars at 40pc and very few stars ( only those with very large components of motion ) at 100pc .",
    "however a sample with a proper motion limit @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 will include @xmath595% of the stars at 40pc and @xmath570% of the stars at 100pc .    background giant stars , on the other hand , tend to have small proper motions , which exclude them from the superblink catalog .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of proper motions for red giant stars in the hipparcos catalog , selected with the color and absolute magnitude cuts @xmath231.0 , @xmath243.0 .",
    "the bulk of the giants have proper motions below the superblink threshold .",
    "this particular subset of giants , because it is from the hipparcos catalog , also represents the nearest red giants to the sun , since they all have magnitudes @xmath25 .",
    "more distant giants would have even smaller proper motions , and would also be excluded from our sample .",
    "figure 3 shows the distribution of optical - to - infrared @xmath26 colors for a subset of m dwarfs with spectral classification from the sloan digital sky survey database @xcite .",
    "infrared @xmath27 magnitudes are from 2mass , while @xmath28 magnitudes are the superblink visual magnitudes , estimated from palomar sky survey photographic plate measurements as described in @xcite .",
    "the subset includes all stars in sdss which have counterparts in the superblink proper motion catalog . for this subset of nearby m dwarfs ,",
    "@xmath26 color ranges from @xmath29 at subtype m0 , to @xmath30 at subtype m9 .",
    "we adopt an m dwarf color - cut of @xmath31 , which is expected to include most stars of subtype m0 and later , at the expense of some contamination from late - k stars .",
    "in addition , we select stars that are bright enough to be monitored by current and planned doppler radial velocity instruments . stars as faint as @xmath32 are routinely monitored using the high resolution spectrometer ( hires ) on the 10  m keck i telescope , e.g. @xcite , and fainter but highly meritorious stars with transiting planets , e.g. gj 1214 @xcite , have been observed .",
    "m dwarf stars are brighter in the near - infrared , and future high - resolution spectrometers should be able to detect planets around stars as faint as @xmath33 . anticipating such developments , we select stars with @xmath34 , which also includes all m dwarfs with @xmath35 .    to summarize ,",
    "we select bright m dwarfs among high proper motion stars ( @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 ) in the superblink catalog using these color / magnitude cuts : @xmath36    figure 4 shows the full magnitude - color distribution of superblink stars , and the region targeted by our selection . out of 2,270,481 stars in the superblink catalog , our color and magnitude cuts select 10,659 bright red stars .",
    "this we use as our initial sample to identify bright m dwarfs .",
    "the sky distribution of the color - selected stars is shown in figure 5 .",
    "separate plots show the stars listed in the tycho-2 and hipparcos catalogs ( top ) , stars from the superblink catalog which are not listed in tycho-2 or hipparcos _ and _ have proper motions @xmath1 150 mas yr@xmath2 ( center ) , and finally stars from the superblink catalog not listed in tycho-2 or hipparcos _ and _ with proper motions 40 mas yr@xmath37 150 mas yr@xmath2 ( bottom ) .",
    "the subsample from the tycho-2 and hipparcos catalogs includes 3,319 of the brighter stars , spread over the entire sky .",
    "their distribution shows a slight overdensity in the direction of the galactic bulge , which is likely due to the larger number of red giants found in that part of the sky . the very high proper motion ( @xmath1 150 mas yr@xmath2 ) subsample from superblink includes 4,398 stars , and extends uniformly over the entire sky .",
    "the moderately high proper motion ( 40 mas yr@xmath37 150 mas yr@xmath2 ) subsample from superblink includes 2,941 stars , and clearly suffers from incompleteness in the southern hemisphere ; the subsample also displays an overdensity around ( @xmath38,@xmath39)@xmath5(80,+20 ) which is associated with the nearby hyades cluster .",
    "giant stars constitute the main source of contaminant in the sample . indeed , an excess of red sources in the apparent magnitude range @xmath40 ( see figure 4 ) points to a modest population of very red m giants in the superblink catalog ( probably including agb stars ) . while these giants are only a tiny fraction of the full superblink catalog , they are systematically selected in our initial color / magnitude cut . to eliminate these giants from our sample",
    "we apply three selection criteria .",
    "the first is based on evaluation of absolute magnitudes , and is used on stars with existing parallax data .",
    "the second method identifies giants from their location in a reduced proper motion diagram , and is used for stars for which there are no existing parallax measurements .",
    "a third method selects for m dwarfs based on @xmath41 and @xmath42 colors , further eliminating giants and interlopers with bad optical and/or infrared photometry .",
    "we searched the literature to find astrometric parallaxes for stars in our subsample of m dwarf candidates .",
    "parallaxes for 1,622 stars were recovered from the updated version of the hipparcos catalog @xcite .",
    "ground - based astrometric parallaxes were additionally recovered for 10 stars in @xcite , 46 stars in @xcite , 15 stars in @xcite , 6 stars in @xcite , 3 stars in @xcite , 1 star in @xcite , 2 stars in @xcite , 18 stars in @xcite , 4 stars in @xcite , 14 stars in @xcite , 15 stars in @xcite , 3 stars in @xcite , and 3 stars in @xcite . whenever parallaxes were found for one star in more than one bibliographical source",
    ", we adopted the most recent measurement , following the order above .",
    "the numbers quoted above refer to incremental additions to the list of parallaxes .",
    "in addition , we found parallaxes for 3 stars in the sky2000 master catalog , version 4 @xcite , and for 315 more from the nstars database . in all cases we only retained parallax measurements with errors @xmath020% .",
    "the final tally comprises a total of 2,080 stars with astrometric parallaxes .    from the parallax @xmath43",
    "we calculate absolute visual magnitudes using : @xmath44 the resulting hertzsprung - russel ( h - r ) diagram is displayed in figure 6 .",
    "the stars populate two very distinct loci .",
    "the more luminous group includes all m giants and the less luminous group consists of all the m dwarfs . for stars with @xmath29 , the giants are typically 7 - 8 magnitudes more luminous than the dwarfs .",
    "the difference in luminosity only increases at redder colors , with the reddest giants almost 20 magnitudes more luminous than dwarfs of similar @xmath26 color .    from the absolute magnitude @xmath45 and optical - to - infrared color @xmath26 , we define the following criterion for a star to be considered an m dwarf : @xmath46 this cut identifies 561 stars as most likely to be red giants .",
    "the remaining 1,519 objects are identified as m dwarfs .",
    "we emphasize that this selection works only for the @xmath47 stars in our initial sample for which astrometric parallax measurements are available .",
    "note that the color - magnitude relationship for the m dwarfs in our sample closely follows : @xmath48 which implies that we are eliminating stars that are more than 4.5 magnitudes overluminous compared to the average m dwarf of the same color .",
    "this cut could possibly eliminate some very young m dwarfs , which tend to be overluminous in an optical - to - infrared color - magnitude diagram @xcite .",
    "indeed a number of stars with parallaxes appear to be a few magnitudes over - luminous compared to average field stars .",
    "however a close examination of figure 6 indicates that our magnitude cut would , in the worst case , eliminate only a handful of objects that could have been overluminous dwarfs .      for stars without parallax measurements , it is possible to identify giants based on their location in a reduced proper motion diagram .",
    "the reduced proper motion is defined as : @xmath49 a quantity which is analogous to the absolute magnitude @xmath45 ( eq.3 ) except that the proper motion @xmath50 is substituted for the parallax @xmath43 .",
    "the two quantities are mathematically connected , with : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the projected motion in the plane of the sky , i.e. the transverse velocity , here expressed in km s@xmath2 .",
    "this means that the reduced proper motion diagram is basically an h - r diagram where the ordinates are modulated by the individual components of transverse velocities .",
    "just as in the h - r diagram , m giants and m dwarfs tend to occupy distinct loci , with the giants all having relatively low values of @xmath53 and clustering in the upper part of the diagram .",
    "we demonstrate this in the upper panel of figure 7 , which shows the reduced proper motion diagram of the stars in our sample for which there are parallax measurements .",
    "stars identified as giants based on their parallax are plotted in red , dwarfs are plotted in black .",
    "we define a demarcation line which separates stars of the two groups quite well . from this",
    ", we postulate that m dwarfs can be separated from giants following this criterion : @xmath54 because the reduced proper motion depends on both absolute magnitude _ and _ transverse velocity , our selection may eliminate some main sequence m dwarfs if their transverse motion is small . based on equations 5 and 7",
    ", we see that stars on the mean main sequence will be eliminated if their transverse velocity @xmath55 km s@xmath2 .",
    "given that the velocity dispersion for stars in the solar neighborhood is @xmath540 km s@xmath2 @xcite , our adopted criterion will exclude relatively few m dwarfs .",
    "conversely , giants with large transverse velocities will also have large values of @xmath53 which may place them beyond the limit defined in equation 8 . among the parallax - confirmed giants , we find 4 stars which fall within our defined reduced proper motion cut for m dwarfs .",
    "one of the stars has a inferred transverse velocity @xmath56 km s@xmath2 based on its hipparcos parallax and proper motion .",
    "however the other three stars have suspiciously faint absolute magnitudes ( 4.5@xmath575.0 ) for m giants , and may instead be m dwarfs with erroneous ( underestimated ) parallaxes measurements .",
    "the reduced proper motion diagram of stars with no parallax measurements is shown in the bottom panel of figure 7 .",
    "of the 8,580 stars with proper motions but no parallax measurements , we identify 626 as probable m giants , and those are eliminated from the sample .",
    "the remaining 7,954 stars are retained as m dwarf candidates .",
    "this leaves 9,473 stars , with or without parallax , on the list of m bright m dwarf candidates .",
    "a significant number of sources are found to have very red colors ( @xmath585 ) and reduced proper motion in the range typical for dwarf stars ( @xmath5912 ) and yet fall above the line we defined as the giant - dwarf boundary .",
    "a close examination of their infrared colors shows that most of these stars fall outside the normal range for m dwarfs ( see below ) and are likely either stars with erroneous ( overestimated ) v magnitudes , or distant f - g - k stars with large components of reddening .",
    "most of these stars are eliminated after the infrared cuts described below .",
    "giant stars are notable for having infrared colors different from the m dwarfs , most apparent in a [ ( @xmath41),(@xmath60 ) ] color - color diagram .",
    "this has been known since @xcite .",
    "dwarf stars have comparatively bluer @xmath41 colors than giants .",
    "this is due to opacity differences , mostly from molecular bands of h@xmath61o , which yield significantly higher @xmath62-band and @xmath63-band opacities in m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "figure 8 shows the [ ( @xmath41),(@xmath60 ) ] color - color distribution for the stars in our initial sample .",
    "stars with parallax measurements are shown in the upper panel , stars without parallax in the lower panel . in both panels ,",
    "all objects we have identified as probable giants , based on either absolute magnitude (  2.4.1 ) or reduced proper motion(2.4.2 ) , are plotted in red .",
    "the remaining m dwarf candidates are plotted in black .",
    "the giants are clearly segregated from the dwarfs along j - h , although there is a small overlap between the two groups . in fact",
    "m dwarfs appear to be confined to a relatively compact region around @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "a small number of alleged m dwarfs fall outside the cluster ; some have red @xmath41 colors more consistent with the m giants , and indeed they most probably are .",
    "other stars have bluer colors which are more typical of f - g - k stars ; we suspect these probably are more massive main sequence stars which made it into our sample probably due to an overestimated photographic magnitude @xmath28 , which would also overestimate the @xmath26 color term , bringing them into the m star subsample . in order to eliminate",
    "these leftover misidentified m giants and misclassified f - g - k stars , we further restrict our m dwarf selection to the region in [ ( @xmath41),(@xmath60 ) ] diagram bounded by : @xmath66 among stars with trigonometric parallaxes , we find that 97 of the m dwarf candidates ( black dots in figure 8 upper panel ) fall outside the limits of the region defined above .",
    "we conclude that these stars likely have significant errors in their estimated optical or infrared magnitudes , and we exclude them from our census of m dwarfs .    among stars with no parallax measurements identified as probable m dwarfs from the reduced proper motion cut ( black dots in figure 8)",
    ", we find 487 which fall outside the defined m dwarf boundaries ; these stars are eliminated as well .",
    "some of the stars have color consistent with f - g - k main sequence stars ( 0@xmath670.2 , 0.1@xmath680.6 ) and most likely made the initial @xmath582.7 color cut due to an underestimated v magnitude .",
    "other excluded sources have @xmath690.7 , and are either giants or distant main sequence stars with large reddening . after these cuts , we are left with a list of 8,889 probable bright m dwarfs , which we retain for building our catalog .      among the giants confirmed through parallax ( stars plotted in red in the upper panel of figure 8) a small number fall within the selection box for m dwarfs .",
    "specifically , 66 of the 561 giants fall within the region defined by equations 9 - 13 .",
    "this means that jhk color cuts alone are susceptible to contamination by background giants .",
    "this makes the reduced proper motion selection critical in minimizing giant contamination .",
    "note that only 4 of the 561 giants have reduced proper motions within the limit defined for m dwarfs , which increases our confidence that giant contamination in our catalog is negligible .",
    "the reduced proper motion cut , on the other hand , may be eliminating bona fide m dwarfs , as mentioned in  2.4.2 above .",
    "the lower panel in figure 8 show evidence for this , as 160 of the 626 stars excluded after the reduced proper motion cut ( plotted in red ) do fall within the m dwarf box .",
    "overall this suggests that our adopted selection criteria places more of an emphasis on avoiding contamination by giants , at the expense of some incompleteness in the m dwarf targets . from the numbers above",
    ", we predict that @xmath70100 m dwarfs might be missing from our catalog because they fail the reduced proper motion cut .",
    "in addition , we note that stars identified as giants based on parallax data ( figure 8 top panel , red dots ) and stars excluded from the reduced proper motion cuts ( figure 8 bottom panel , red dots ) show significantly different distributions in @xmath41/@xmath60 color - color space .",
    "one average the parallax giants tend to have bluer @xmath42 colors .",

    "the distribution of fainter ( @xmath107 ) m dwarfs , on the other hand , shows a net deficit of objects in the southern sky , especially for @xmath108 . as discussed in  2.3 this is due to the limited coverage of superblink in the south , where the survey is only complete for proper motions @xmath18 mas yr@xmath2 , compared to @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 in the north . the distribution , however , does not show any overdensity / deficit of stars at low galactic latitudes , which suggests both a high completeness and low contamination from background giants .",

    "one can not speak of incompleteness due to the magnitude limit , since the @xmath34 magnitude limit was _ imposed _ as a primary constraint to the catalog .",
    "figure 12 however illustrates the effects of this magnitude limit in restricting the distance range of the stars in the catalog .",
    "all the m dwarfs with @xmath34 populate the nearest 75 parsecs .",
    "the limiting distance is also a function of absolute magnitude thus spectral subtype .",
    "late - type m dwarfs , which have lower absolute magnitudes @xmath45 , have a much shorter distance limit in our catalog , which explains the strong deficit of stars with subtypes later than m4 ( see figure 10 ) .",
    "the main source of incompleteness in our magnitude - limited catalog is kinematic bias .",
    "because all of our stars are selected among sources with proper motions @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 , nearby stars with low components of their transverse motion @xmath109 ( i.e. projected motion in the plane of the sky ) may be missed .",
    "nearby stars can have low values of @xmath109 either because of a low intrinsic motion relative to the sun , or because their motion vector is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the sky .",
    "for example , a star at 50 parsecs from the sun with @xmath110 mas yr@xmath2 has a transverse velocity @xmath1119.48 km s@xmath2 , which will occur with a probability of about 10% for stars in the solar neighborhood",
    "( see  2.2 and fig.1 ) .",
    "the superblink catalog currently has a higher proper motion limit ( @xmath112 mas yr@xmath2 ) in large swaths of the southern sky , which makes our census much more prone to a kinematic bias .",
    "this explains the deficit of sources in the southern sky ( fig.11 ) .",
    "this is only mitigated at the bright end because of our use of the hipparcos and tycho-2 catalogs .    to estimate the overall completeness of our catalog , we proceed in two steps .",
    "first we use monte - caro simulations to estimate the completeness of the northern sky census , which we assume to suffer only from kinematic bias due to the @xmath110 mas yr@xmath2 proper motion limit .",
    "then we assume that the local distribution of field stars is isotropic in the vicinity of the sun , and thus infer how many stars are missing from the southern sky census , i.e. assuming that both the north and south hemisphere should have the same number of bright m dwarfs .",
    "we first assume that the transverse velocity @xmath109 is independent of the distance @xmath113 for stars in the solar neighborhood , and assume a statistical distribution of the form @xmath114 .",
    "we extract from our data the statistical distributions @xmath115 and @xmath116 from appropriate cuts in @xmath113 and @xmath109 . for @xmath117",
    ", we consider only stars in the northern sky with transverse velocities @xmath118 km s@xmath2 ; this boundary is illustrated in figure 12 ( lower - left panel ) , which shows that the stars that satisfy this constraint do not suffer from the kinematic bias , because all the stars in our catalog which have @xmath118 km s@xmath2 also have proper motions @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "the normalized distribution function @xmath117 is shown in figure 13 ( top panel ) . for @xmath119",
    ", we consider only stars with distances @xmath120 parsecs ; again the boundary is illustrated in figure 12 , and shows that these very nearby stars suffer from minimal kinematic bias , because stars with proper motions @xmath110 mas yr@xmath2 ( and missing from the census ) can only have @xmath121 km s@xmath2 , which excludes very few stars .",
    "the normalized distribution function @xmath119 is shown in figure 13 ( bottom panel ) where the limit of completeness ( @xmath122 km s@xmath2 ) is shown for reference .",
    "given the sharp drop in @xmath119 for transverse motions @xmath123 km s@xmath2 , it is safe to assume that the sample of @xmath120 parsecs stars is essentially complete .",
    "we perform monte - carlo simulations based on the statistical distribution @xmath117 and @xmath119 to estimate the probability that an m dwarf with @xmath34 will be detected in our survey .",
    "we thus estimate that our census of the northern sky has a completeness of @xmath124% .",
    "this means that the 5,361 stars in the northern sky sample are most likely drawn from a hypothetical sample of 5,840@xmath7318 stars .",
    "the @xmath125 stars missing due to the kinematic bias are expected to have proper motions @xmath110 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "the above analysis assumes that the superblink survey is complete within the proper motion range and magnitude limit .",
    "if the survey itself is incomplete , then the number of missing objects would be larger .",
    "the completeness of the superblink survey generally depends magnitude and field density .",
    "however in the magnitude range under consideration ( 8@xmath12615 ) a completeness test based on the fraction of tycho-2 stars recovered by superblink _ and _ the fraction of superblink stars listed in tycho-2 , suggests that the combined tycho-2/superblink catalog has a completeness @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "if we factor in the possibility that @xmath52% stars in that magnitude range have escaped detection by both tycho-2 and superblink , this would bring the total number of hypothetical bright m dwarfs in the northern sky to @xmath55,950 stars .",
    "our southern sky census is significantly less complete than the northern census .",
    "while our catalog has 5,361 stars north of the celestial equator , it only has 3,528 in the south .",
    "the main reason for the incompleteness is the limited coverage of the superblink proper motion survey in the south .",
    "the survey is complete to @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 for the entire northern sky , but reaches that limit only over a fraction of the south , mainly in the declination range @xmath128 ( see fig.11 ) south of @xmath129 , the survey is only complete to @xmath18 mas yr@xmath2 , but reaches to @xmath130 mas yr@xmath2 in some areas .",
    "the incompleteness of the superblink survey is mitigated by the inclusion of the tycho-2 catalog , which is mostly limited by magnitude and actually includes stars with proper motions smaller than the superblink limit of @xmath13140 mas yr@xmath2 .",
    "however the magnitude limit of the tycho-2 catalog , @xmath13212.0 , is too bright to include all but a fraction of the m dwarfs in the magnitude range of interest ( @xmath133 ) .    under the assumption that the northern sky census is fully representative of the entire volume around the sun , i.e. assuming the m dwarf distribution to be _ isotropic _ in the solar neighborhood , we use the results from the monte - carlo simulation above and estimate that the southern - sky census of m dwarfs brighter than @xmath33 should also include 5,950 stars , for a total of 11,900 m dwarfs over the entire sky . given that our southern sample includes only 3,528 stars ,",
    "we thus conclude that we are currently missing @xmath52,420 stars in the southern sky . in other words our southern sky census has a completeness of only @xmath559.3% .",
    "the need to assemble a comprehensive list of _ bright _ m dwarfs over the entire sky is primarily motivated by the search for extra - solar planets . based on current techniques ,",
    "m dwarfs are the most promising stars around which to look for earth - mass planet in a habitable zone .",
    "radial velocity measurements are most sensitive to the reflex motion from planets in close orbits around their parent stars , or to planets orbiting low - mass stars ; for planets in habitable zones , this favors m dwarfs , whose zone is closer in , and whose masses are relatively low .",
    "transit surveys have a higher chance of detecting planets in close orbits , and are more sensitive to planets orbiting smaller stars ; this likewise favors m dwarfs as the most promising targets .",
    "the main caveat is that both radial velocity measurements and transit monitoring are most efficient for relatively bright stars . with current observational resources ,",
    "radial - velocity monitoring can realistically be performed on stars with absolute magnitudes @xmath134 , and near - term developments only promise to increase the depth of surveys by one or two magnitudes , most notably by observing at infrared wavelengths where m dwarfs are noticeably brighter .",
    "m dwarfs with apparent infrared magnitudes @xmath34 will soon be within range of radial velocity surveys .",
    "the motivation of the superblink proper motion survey is to identify the largest possible number of hydrogen - burning objects up to at least 100 parsecs of the sun . with a low proper motion limit of @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 and astrometric accuracy @xmath135 mas yr@xmath2 ,",
    "the catalog suffers from minimal kinematic bias to a distance of 50 - 60 parsecs , which is the range over which one would expect to find m dwarfs with @xmath34 .",
    "the current superblink catalog is complete over the entire northern sky , but the southern sky survey is still in progress . at this time",
    ", the catalog has a proper motion limit @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 in the declination range @xmath136 ; at southern declinations the proper motion limit is now @xmath18 mas yr@xmath2 , except for relatively bright stars ( @xmath25 ) for which the catalog extends to @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 because of the inclusion of data from the tycho-2 and hipparcos catalogs .",
    "our search of the current version of the superblink catalog has identified 8,889 bright m dwarfs , of which 5,361 are in the northern sky and 3,528 in the south .",
    "the lower number of stars catalogued in the south reflects the limited extent of our proper motion survey in the south .",
    "our estimate of the kinematic bias suggests that our northern census is @xmath124% complete . from this",
    "we infer that there should be @xmath137 m dwarfs with magnitudes @xmath34 over the entire sky .",
    "our catalog currently lists @xmath138% of the entire set .",
    "we recommend that these stars be observed by radial - velocity monitoring programs with the highest priority .",
    "in addition to exoplanet surveys , completing the census of the solar neighborhood is important to constrain the stellar density in the galaxy , and to determine the distribution of stellar properties .",
    "our catalog includes many stars which are identified here for the first time as members of the solar neighborhood . in particular ,",
    "most of the sources are not listed in the catalog of nearby stars .",
    "the key to completing the census of bright m dwarfs in the south is to obtain a proper motion catalog with a lower proper motion limit , currently limited to @xmath18 mas yr@xmath2 south of @xmath129 .",
    "we are currently working on an extension of the superblink proper motion survey , which will extend the limits to @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 to @xmath139 , and to @xmath130 mas yr@xmath2 in the @xmath140 range .",
    "we predict that extended surveys will identify an additional @xmath141 bright m dwarfs , if a proper motion limit @xmath16 mas yr@xmath2 can be reached over the entire sky .",
    "a revised catalog will be produced as the survey reaches completion .    at this time",
    "we are conducting a systematic spectroscopic follow - up survey of the brightest stars in this catalog , and searching the literature for previous determinations of spectral subtypes .",
