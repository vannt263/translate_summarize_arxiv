    "despite the many efforts to consistently explain the results of the observations of supernovae of type ia ( snia ) in @xcite , the physical nature of the dark sector of the universe , assumed to consist of dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) , remains largely mysterious .",
    "the favored cosmological model is the @xmath2-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath2cdm ) model which also serves as a reference for alternative approaches to the de problem . _",
    "grosso modo _ , the @xmath2cdm model does well in fitting most observational data ( see , e.g. , the recent wmap 9 results @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is an ongoing interest in alternative models within general relativity ( gr ) itself and beyond it .",
    "although no serious contender seems to be around at the present time , these efforts continue to make sense not only because of the notorious cosmological constant and coincidence problems ( see , e.g. @xcite ) but also to test as many potential deviations from the  standard \" description as possible in order to constrain additional parameter sets which are usually introduced in alternative approaches in order to quantify these deviations . typically , these approaches  dynamize \" the cosmological constant in terms of scalar fields or fluids with a generally time - dependent equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "constraining a potential time dependence by the data , e.g. , is then crucial for a comparison with the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "holographic models represent a specific class of dynamic approaches to the de problem .",
    "these models are characterized by a relation between an ultraviolet cutoff and an infrared cutoff @xcite .",
    "such relation guarantees that the energy in a given volume does not exceed the energy of a black hole of the same size . the infrared cutoff has to be a cosmological length scale . for the most obvious choice , the hubble radius , only models in which dark matter and dark energy are interacting with each other also nongravitationally , give rise to a suitable dynamics @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , there has been a considerable number of investigations based on the future event horizon as cutoff scale @xcite .",
    "however , all models with a cutoff at the future event horizon suffer from the serious drawback that they can not describe a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion .",
    "a future event horizon does not exist during the period of decelerated expansion .",
    "a further option that has received attention more recently and which will be the subject of the present paper is a model based on a cutoff length proportional to the ricci scale .",
    "the role of a distance proportional to the ricci scale as a causal connection scale for perturbations was noticed in @xcite . as a cutoff length in de models",
    "it was first used in @xcite .",
    "afterwards , investigations along this line have been carried out in @xcite . in @xcite observational constraints",
    "were obtained on the basis of which ricci de was compared with the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "the dynamics of perturbations was considered in @xcite .",
    "a number of studies performed in @xcite include interactions between dm and ricci de .",
    "a relation to quantum field theory has been claimed in @xcite .",
    "various generalizations rely on the cutoff introduced in @xcite .",
    "other previous work in the field includes @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we reconsider the dynamics of a two - component system of pressureless dm and ricci - type de both in the homogeneous and isotropic background and on the perturbative level .",
    "while most dynamic de scenarios start with an assumption for the eos parameter for the de , the starting point of holographic models is an expression for the de energy density from which the eos is then derived .",
    "moreover , as was pointed out in @xcite , the mere definition of the holographic de density generally implies an interaction with the dm component .",
    "requiring this interaction to vanish imposes an additional condition on the dynamics .",
    "noninteracting ricci - type de , in particular , is characterized by a simple relation between the matter fraction and the necessarily time - dependent eos parameter .",
    "therefore it is not compatible with a cosmological constant .",
    "we shall confront the resulting background dynamics with recent snia data , results from baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and from the history @xmath3 of the hubble parameter .",
    "a crucial issue for ricci - type de is the perturbation dynamics @xcite .",
    "based on a gauge - invariant analysis , the matter perturbations are found as a combination of the total and the relative energy - density perturbations . in general ,",
    "the perturbation dynamics suffers from instabilities . for a phantom - type eos these",
    "should have occurred already before the present time .",
    "consequently , phantom de is not consistent with our approach . for present eos parameters",
    "@xmath4 one obtains growth - rate oscillations and instabilities as well , this time at finite future values of the scale factor @xmath5 .",
    "we shall show that there exists just one situation without instabilities at finite values of @xmath5 .",
    "it is characterized by a de saturation parameter already obtained in @xcite .",
    "we show that for this configuration to be realized , a certain relationship between the current matter content @xmath0 of the universe and the eos parameter @xmath1 is required . remarkably ,",
    "under the corresponding condition the pressure perturbations vanish and the mentioned ( unobserved ) oscillation disappear",
    ". moreover , the cosmic coincidence problem is substantially alleviated since holographic ricci de itself behaves as nonrelativistic matter at high redshift .",
