    "the behavior of the single nucleon in the medium bears clear signatures of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) correlations induced by the strong nuclear interaction .",
    "the most celebrated one is the presence of high momentum components in the momentum distribution ( md ) , which may be explained only in terms of short range correlations ( src ) and can not be justified by any independent particle model ( ipm)@xcite .",
    "in addition , both short and long  range correlations ( lrc ) are now widely thought to be the origin of the large reduction of the spectroscopic strengths of the hole states@xcite .    in general ,",
    "the investigation of src is one of the main topics in the physics of strongly interacting systems , from liquid helium to nuclear matter .",
    "the translational invariance of homogeneous media has made possible a quantitative assesment of their importance in these contexts .",
    "however , the advances in realistic many  body theories have only recently allowed to address the same issue in inhomogeneous objects , as atomic nuclei , with a comparable accuracy . to this aim ,",
    "correlated basis functions ( cbf ) theory has emerged as an effective tool to tackle the src problem in nuclear systems @xcite when realistic hamiltonians are employed . when used in conjuction with the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) integral equations@xcite , cbf has attained in @xmath0o and @xmath1ca the same accuracy as in the best variational studies of nuclear matter@xcite .    in order to dissentagle the src effects",
    ", one has to look at effects that go beyond any possible ipm description of the nucleus .",
    "src are mainly produced by the repulsive core of the nn interaction , whereas important intermediate and long range contributions ( essentially of the tensor type ) come from the exchange of one or more pions .",
    "this part of the nuclear interaction is the responsible of the nuclear binding@xcite .",
    "direct evidence of the src are not easy to experimentally single out and only in these last few years , thanks to the advances in the experimental techniques , there have been consistent efforts aimed to their identification . for instance , @xmath5 data in the quasi - elastic region need a large reduction of the ipm hole strength to be reproduced @xcite",
    ". moreover , charge density distributions obtained by elastic electron scattering experiments are smaller than those predicted by the ipm @xcite in the nuclear interior .",
    "these facts can be be explained by assuming occupation probabilities of the single particle levels different from the ipm ones@xcite .",
    "the basic quantity to investigate in order to verify the hypothesis of partial occupation probability is the one body density matrix ( obdm ) , @xmath6 , defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ground state a  body wave function and @xmath9 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a nucleon at the position @xmath10 .",
    "the fourier transform of the obdm gives the momentum distribution ( md ) , @xmath11 , sometimes used in plane wave impulse approximation to study inclusive and exclusive reactions .",
    "the natural orbits ( no)@xcite , with their occupation numbers ( @xmath12 ) , are defined as the basis where the obdm is diagonal . in the ipm ,",
    "the nuclear ground state is described by a slater determinant of fully occupied single particle ( sp ) wave functions below the fermi surface , @xmath13 .",
    "so , the no and the sp w.f .",
    "coincide , with @xmath14=1 and @xmath15=0 .",
    "deviations from this situation are a measure of the correlations , since they deplete the populated orbitals and allow higher no to get @xmath160 .",
    "other important quantities are the quasihole ( qh ) wave functions , @xmath17 , defined as the overlaps between @xmath18 and the hole states , @xmath19 , obtained by removing a nucleon from the position @xmath20 . from @xmath5 experiments it is possible to obtain an accurate determination of the qh overlap functions@xcite , whose normalizations give the spectroscopic factors , @xmath21 .",
    "typical values of @xmath21 , as extracted from the experiments , are @xmath22@xcite , and the deviations from unity ( their ipm value ) come in account of various effects , from center of mass to correlation corrections .    in cbf theory the description of the correlations starts with an a  body correlated wave function @xmath23 corresponding to a symmetrized product of non commuting two - body correlation operators , @xmath24 , acting on the mean field wave function , @xmath25 , given by a slater determinant of single particle wave functions , @xmath26 .",
    "a realistic choice of @xmath24 is : @xmath27 where @xmath28\\otimes \\left [ 1 , { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}_i \\cdot { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}_j \\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath29 is the tensor operator .",
    "the variational principle provides a natural recipe to determine the correlation functions , @xmath30 , and the single particle wave functions by minimizing the ground state energy . in our calculation",
    "we adopt a non relativistic nuclear hamiltonian of the form : @xmath31 where we have used the @xmath32 reduction of the argonne @xmath33 @xcite potential and the urbana ix@xcite three  nucleon interaction .",
    "the one body density matrix ( [ obdm_0 ] ) of doubly closed shell nuclei in ( @xmath34 ) coupling can be evaluated in fhnc@xcite , starting from @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the mass number .",
    "once the obdm is known , its diagonal part provides the one body density , @xmath38 , and the momentum distribution may be computed by @xmath39 the independent particle model expression for the obdm is well known and reads as : @xmath40    in the case of jastrow correlated wave functions ( when only the first component of the correlation ( [ corr6 ] ) is retained ) , the density matrix may be expanded in powers of the _ dynamical correlations _ ,",
    "@xmath41 ^ 2 - 1 $ ] and @xmath42 , and of the _ statistical correlations_. the expansion generates cluster terms classified according to the number of particles and to the number of the correlation lines .",
    "the fhnc equations allow for summing cluster terms at all orders .",
    "details of the finite systems fhnc theory may be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the fhnc equations for the more general @xmath43 correlation of ( [ corr6 ] ) were derived in ref.@xcite for the one and two body densities and for the obdm .",
    "the single particle wave functions needed to build the slater determinant @xmath25 have been obtained by solving the single particle schrdinger equation with a woods  saxon potential , @xmath44}}}\\ , , \\label{ws}\\ ] ] whose parameters have been fixed to reproduce at best the nuclei empirical densities .",
    "this choice , while spoiling the binding energies by only a few percent with respect to a full minimization , provides an accurate description of the nuclear densities@xcite .",
    "the correlated momentum distributions computed within the cbf scheme are shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the mds of @xmath0o ( continuous line ) and of @xmath1ca ( dashed line ) are compared with that of nuclear matter with jastrow ( thin solid line ) and full ( dash  dotted line ) correlations .",
    "the ipm momentum distributions are given by squares ( @xmath0o ) and stars ( @xmath1ca ) .",
    "we stress that the differences between the jastrow and the @xmath43 correlations are similar in the infinite and finite systems and that the three cases show an analogous behavior in large momentum region , that is dominated by the short range structure ( and the nn correlations ) of the nuclear wave function .",
    "the effect is , to a large extent , independent on the nucleus .",
    "the tensor correlations enhance the tails of the mds by a factor 23 with respect to the jastrow case , slightly smaller than that found in ref.@xcite ( @xmath454 ) .",
    "the difference may be understood in terms of the stronger tensor force of the argonne @xmath46 potential adopted in that reference , and of the presence of spin  orbit correlations , omitted in our calculation .",
    "another piece of information that can be extracted from the obdm are the natural orbits and their occupation numbers .",
    "the no are obtained by diagonalizing the obdm : @xmath47    for spherical nuclei in ( @xmath34 ) single particle coupling , saturated in both spin and isospin , this expression can be recast as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the legendre polinomials , @xmath50 is the angle between @xmath10 and @xmath51 and @xmath52=4 is the nucleon degeneracy . exploiting again the spherical symmetry , one obtains @xmath53    the first three no of @xmath0o and @xmath1ca are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the no occupation numbers for jastrow and @xmath43 correlations are given in table [ tab : tab1 ] the effect of the correlations on the shell model orbitals are mainly visible in the short range part of the @xmath54 state , making this no more localized than its ipm counterpart .",
    "the shape of the other ipm states is barely influenced .",
    "the occupation of the no corresponding to the shell model ones is depleted by as much as 22@xmath3 ( the @xmath55 state in @xmath1ca ) .",
    "in contrast , the mean field unoccupied states become sizeably populated .",
    "the two effects are largely due to the tensor correlations .",
    "the green function ( gf ) approach of ref.@xcite found the @xmath0o @xmath561 no more populated than the cbf ones for the occupied shell model states ( @xmath570 , 1 ) , and , consequently , lower occupations for all the remaining orbitals ( @xmath58=.921 , @xmath59=.941 and @xmath60=.017 .",
    "the @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) occupation numbers are the average of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) orbitals of the reference ) .",
    "these discrepancies are probably due to the different potentials adopted , rather than to the methodologies . in fact , in the gf calculation the one  boson  exchange bonn b potential@xcite was used .",
    "the a8+uix model induces stronger correlations , so giving a larger depletion of the lowest no .",
    "a similar effect was found in @xmath67he atomic drops@xcite , where the strong repulsive interaction between the @xmath67he atoms depletes the shell model occupations by 1546 @xmath3 .",
    "in a fixed center reference frame , the overlap between the a  body ground  state and the ( a-1)body hole state of the residual system , @xmath68 , is given by @xmath69 in cbf theory @xmath70 is built by substituting @xmath25 in ( [ psi_0 ] ) with the slater determinant obtained by removing a nucleon in the state @xmath71 , @xmath72 . in doubly closed shell nuclei in the @xmath34 coupling scheme the radial dependence of the overlap function can be singled out , as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the spin  isospin single particle wave function . in the ipm ,",
    "the overlaps are simply the shell model functions and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the radial part of @xmath26 .    in order to develop a cluster expansion for @xmath77 ,",
    "its expression is rearranged as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 cluster expansions and fhnc  like equations are then used to compute @xmath81 and @xmath82@xcite , along the lines given in ref.@xcite to evaluate the overlap matrix elements in the cbf study of the nuclear matter spectral function .    finally , the spectroscopic factor , @xmath21 , is given by the quasihole normalization , @xmath83 the independent particle model gives @xmath84 . center of mass ( @xmath85 ) corrections are a first source of correction .",
    "in fact , in the harmonic oscillator model they enhance @xmath21 for the valence hole states ( those having the largest oscillator quantum number , @xmath86 ) by the @xmath87^{n_v}$ ] factor@xcite .",
    "so , the @xmath85corrected @xmath61shell spectroscopic factor of @xmath0o is @xmath88 , while the average between the @xmath55 and @xmath62 states in @xmath1ca is @xmath89 .",
    "similar results are found with the more realistic woods ",
    "saxon orbitals@xcite .    the correlated spectroscopic factors ( without @xmath85 corrections ) in @xmath0o and @xmath1ca",
    "are shown in table [ tab : tab2 ] for @xmath43 and jastrow correlations .",
    "jastrow correlations marginally reduce @xmath21 ( at most 3@xmath3 ) .",
    "central spin ",
    "isospin correlations also provide a few percent depletion in the valence states , whereas the tensor correlations ( @xmath43 ) give most of the reduction .",
    "for instance ,",
    "they lower @xmath90 in @xmath0o to 0.90 and @xmath91 and @xmath92 in @xmath1ca to 0.86 and 0.87 , respectively . the @xmath61 cbf @xmath0o result fully agrees with the variational monte carlo estimate of ref.@xcite .",
    "the operatorial correlations largely influence the low lying states , whose spectroscopic factors are drastically reduced by both central and tensor components : @xmath93 in @xmath0o is 0.70 , @xmath90 and @xmath93 in @xmath1ca are 0.58 and 0.55 , respectively",
    ". the latest experimental values of @xmath94 from the @xmath0o@xmath95n reaction@xcite are @xmath96=0.61 for the 1/2@xmath97 ground state in @xmath98n and @xmath99=0.53 for the lowest 3/2@xmath97 state at 6.32 mev .",
    "this state exhibits 87@xmath3 of the total @xmath100 strength , that is fragmented over three states at 6.32 , 9.93 and 10.70 mev .",
    "the total @xmath100 may be estimated to be @xmath100=0.53/0.87=0.61@xcite . in the @xmath1ca@xmath101k",
    "reaction@xcite the transition to the 1@xmath102 ground state gives @xmath1030.61@xmath1040.07 .",
    "we recall that the cbf values are @xmath1050.90 in @xmath0o and @xmath1060.87 in @xmath1ca .",
    "the squared overlap functions are shown in fig.[fig : fig3 ] for the jastrow and @xmath43 correlations , and are compared with the ipm ones .",
    "jastrow components have little effect on the overlaps , while the spin ",
    "isospin correlations are the main responsible for the quenching of the ipm overlaps and of the spectroscopics factors .",
    "the ipm results obtained by a woods  saxon potential fitting the @xmath0o@xmath95n cross section to the 6.32 mev state with @xmath99=0.53 are shown in the @xmath107@xmath0o panel as stars .",
    "we have rescaled @xmath108 by the factor 0.53/0.90 and the result is in nice agreement with the empirical estimate .",
    "in this contribution we have presented some results obtained within the correlated basis functions theory and concerning the properties of the single nucleon in the nuclear medium .",
    "more specifically , we have discussed the behavior of the one - body density matrix and some related quantities , as the momentum distributions and the natural orbits , in @xmath0o and @xmath1ca using the fermi hypernetted chain resummation technique .",
    "in addition , we have addressed the evaluation of the overlap functions and of the spectroscopic factors within the same approach .",
    "the relevance of the short range correlations , both of central and tensor type , has been stressed .",
    "the results presented here have been obtained using the argonne @xmath109 two  nucleon potential plus the urbana ix three ",
    "nucleon interaction , together with a set of single particle wave functions fixed to reproduce at best the empirical charge distributions of the two nuclei .    the high momentum tail of the momentum distribution is largely dominated by correlations , and tensor components",
    "enhance the tail by a factor 34 with respect to the central ones .",
    "the tensor correlation is also important for the occupation of the natural orbits .",
    "in fact , the reduction of the occupation of the levels below the fermi surface and , conversely , the enhancement above is amplified by the tensor terms .",
    "as far as the correlated overlap functions are concerned , they are close to the single particle wave functions if central correlations are used , whereas their shapes are strongly modified by the tensor correlations .",
    "the overall spectroscopic factors are depleted by 10 - 15% , for the valence levels and 30 - 45% for the deeply lying ones .    in spite of this reduction , the fhnc approach in @xmath0o",
    "does not reproduce the empirical @xmath100 spectroscopic factor extracted from @xmath5 reactions .",
    "a similar situation was met in ref.@xcite for nuclear matter , where the variational calculation of the one  hole strength , @xmath110 , around the fermi level provided @xmath1110.88 , mostly due to tensor correlations .",
    "second order perturbative corrections in a correlated basis , including two  hole one  particle , @xmath112 , correlated states , brought the strength to @xmath113 .",
    "this decrease explains almost half of the discrepancy with the empirical @xmath114pb spectroscopic factor , @xmath115 .",
    "the missing strength can be attributed to the coupling of the single particle waves to the collective low - lying surface vibrations , not reproducible in infinite nuclear matter .",
    "it is expected that the inclusion of correlated @xmath116 corrections in the finite nuclei calculations can similarly take into account the coupling with surface vibrations .",
