    "chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking are important low - energy properties of qcd , and therefore it is natural to hope to incorporate them into a description of a nuclear system .",
    "a promising solution is to employ the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath2pt ) , which has been successfully used in nucleonic systems since the beginning of the 1990 s .",
    "the nuclear operators are derived from a chiral lagrangian following a counting rule .",
    "the transition matrix element is evaluated by convoluting the operator with nuclear wave functions . in the evaluation , a cutoff",
    "is usually applied to the operator , suppressing high momentum modes .",
    "the question then arises whether this regulated operator is still consistent with chiral symmetry . if not",
    ", we may need to introduce a chiral - symmetry - violating operator to recover the symmetry .",
    "although it is conventionally supposed that effects of the high momentum modes are captured by higher order chiral counter terms , it is important to confirm this .",
    "we consider a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis to be useful for this purpose .    in this work , we apply the wilsonian renormalization group ( wrg ) equation to the @xmath0-wave pion production in @xmath1 as described by @xmath2pt@xcite . we introduce a cutoff , which , when reduced using the wrg equation , result in an operator that runs . in the next step , we try to reproduce the rg low - momentum operator using the starting operator plus chiral counter terms of higher order .",
    "if the chiral symmetry is not violated by the cutoff , the renormalized part of the operator should be accurately captured by the chiral counter terms .",
    "at first , we discuss why we use the wrg equation to introduce and/or reduce the cutoff .",
    "this is based on a consistency with the construction of an effective lagrangian .",
    "an effective lagrangian can be obtained formally via a path integral formulation based on the lagrangian of the underlying , more fundamental theory .",
    "one then integrates out the high energy degrees of freedom .",
    "when integrating out the high momentum states of the nucleon in the heavy - baryon @xmath2pt lagrangian , we can also use the path integral .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to solving the wrg equation derived below .",
    "one of the present authors derived the wrg equation for the @xmath3 interaction in this way in ref .",
    "the wrg equation for a transition operator ( @xmath4 production operator in our case ) can also be derived in essentially the same way . here",
    "we outline a simpler derivation of the wrg equation following ref .",
    "@xcite in which a detailed account is given ( appendix a ) .",
    "we start with a matrix element in which the transition operator is defined in a model space spanned by plane wave states of the two - nucleon system .",
    "the maximum magnitude of the relative momentum in this model space is given by the cutoff @xmath5 .",
    "we differentiate the matrix element with respect to @xmath5 and impose the renormalization condition that the matrix element is invariant under cutoff changes .",
    "this gives the wrg equation for the low - momentum transition operator .",
    "( for explicit expressions , see refs .",
    "this differential equation is solved , and the solution in integral form is actually the same as the effective operator in the bloch - horowitz formalism .",
    "we start with the chiral nlo @xmath0-wave pion production operator for the @xmath1 reaction@xcite . using the integral form of the wrg equation",
    ", we calculate the rg low - momentum operator for @xmath5 = 500  mev , using the cd - bonn @xmath3-potential .",
    "we employ near threshold kinematics , , @xmath6 = 0.1 , where @xmath7 is the emitted pion momentum divided by the pion mass .",
    "we use the chiral counter terms of higher order \\{see eq .  ( 7 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for expressions } to simulate the renormalized part of the low - momentum operator .",
    "the running of the radial part of the @xmath8 transition operator ( diagonal matrix elements ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_run ] .",
    "the solid line is the starting nlo chiral operator ( before renormalization ) .",
    "after the rg running , we obtain the rg low - momentum operator shown by the dashed line ( @xmath5  =  1000  mev ) , dotted line ( @xmath5  =  750  mev ) , and dash - dotted line ( @xmath5  =  500  mev ) .",
    "we parameterize this low - momentum operator using the nlo operator plus the counter terms , omitting the kink part when fitting the counter terms . in fig .",
    "[ fig_diag ] we show the simulation of the low - momentum operator using the nlo operator plus the counter terms .",
    "the dash - dotted line is the starting nlo chiral operator .",
    "the dashed line contains the nlo operator plus the lowest counter term .",
    "the dotted line contains the additional terms of one higher order .",
    "the renormalized part ( the difference between the solid and dash - dotted lines ) is thus accurately captured by the higher order counter terms of natural strength .",
    "as for the off - diagonal matrix elements , we find a similar trend in the simulation using the counter terms .     the rg low - momentum pion production operator ( @xmath5 = 500 mev , @xmath6 = 0.1 ) , shown by the solid line , is simulated by the original nlo operator ( dash - dotted line ) plus a contact term with one nucleon derivative ( dashed line ) .",

    "the dotted line has additional contact terms with three derivatives.,width=245 ]    our result allows us to conclude that , to the level of precision ( and order ) we are working , the @xmath1 calculation is renormalized without including a chiral - symmetry - violating counter term .",
    "however , this outcome does not necessarily mean that the ( sharp ) cutoff regularization does not generate _ any _ chiral - symmetry - violating operator .",
    "nevertheless , we could still claim that there is no _ practical _ ground for introducing a chiral - symmetry - violating operator for this process .",
    "we have studied what happens to the pion production operator when a cutoff is introduced . in particular , we are interested in the possibility that the running with cutoff requires us to introduce a chiral - symmetry - violating interaction .",
    "we started with the chiral nlo operator  @xcite for @xmath0-wave pion production in @xmath1 and introduced a cutoff by using the wrg equation .",
    "after the rg running , we parameterized the rg low - momentum operator by a chiral expansion including higher - order counter terms , which are expected to absorb contributions from the high momentum states that were integrated out .",
    "we found that the expansion is indeed accurate , with the lecs of natural strength .",
    "therefore , we see no evidence that the running with the cutoff generates chiral - symmetry - violating interactions .",
