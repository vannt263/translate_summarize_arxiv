    "spatial econometric models have been widely used in many areas ( e.g. , economics , political science and public health ) to deal with spatial interaction effects among geographical units ( e.g. , jurisdictions , regions , and states ) .",
    "recently , the spatial econometrics literature has exhibited a growing interest in the specification and estimation of econometric relationships based on spatial panels , which typically refer to data containing time series observations of a number of spatial units .",
    "for instance , kapoor _ et al_. ( 2007 ) developed a generalized moments ( gm ) estimator for a space - time model with error components that are both spatially and time - wise correlated .",
    "lee and yu ( 2010 ) proposed the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimator for the spatial autoregressive ( sar ) panel model with both spatial lag and spatial disturbances .",
    "all these works were developed based on ( conditional ) mean regression methods . compared with mean regression methods ,",
    "the quantile regression ( qr ) method is more robust and can be adopted to deal with data characterized by different error distributions .",
    "recently , there has been a growing literature on estimating and testing of qr panel data models .",

    "however , quantile regression estimation for spatial econometric panel models has not been studied in existing literature .",
    "this paper focuses on the qr estimations in the general sar panel data model with both individual fixed effects and time period specific effects ( see , e.g. , lee and yu , 2010 ) . we employ the instrumental variable quantile regression ( ivqr ) method to estimate the parameters .",
