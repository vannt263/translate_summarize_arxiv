    ", there is a one to one correspondence between subgroups of the modular group and covers of @xmath0 .",
    "denote by @xmath2 the category of all subgroups of the modular group with inclusions as morphisms and by @xmath3 the category of all finite - index subgroups of @xmath1 , with inclusions as morphisms .",
    "these two categories are equivalent to the base - pointed covering category @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) of ( resp .",
    "finite ) covers of the modular orbifold .",
    "denote by @xmath6 and @xmath7 the corresponding covering categories obtained by forgetting the base points .",
    "our aim here is to give the reader a panorama of these categories .    the categories @xmath6 and @xmath4 and @xmath8 contains uncountably many objects . on the other hand , objects in the categories @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath9 can be represented by modular graphs , i.e. a certain class of finite bipartite ribbon graphs or dessins denfants , usually thought of as graphs embedded on oriented topological surfaces . by a celebrated theorem of belyi , @xcite , these graphs admit a galois action , i.e. an action of the absolute galois group , @xmath10 .",
    "this action is faithful .",
    "the idea of studying @xmath10 through this interaction between @xmath10 and the modular group @xmath1 is the main motivation of the  dessins \" program , @xcite .",
    "however , deligne put already in 1989 :  grothendieck and his students developed a combinatorial description (  maps `` ) of finite covers of @xmath11 ... this did not help to understand the galois action .",
    "one has just a few examples of non - solvable covers whose galois conjugates have been computed '' , @xcite .",
    "confirming deligne s convictions , it seems that the picture that emerged after almost 40 years of research is far from the original expectations expressed very lively in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it turns out that understanding this galois action on all of @xmath12 appears to be a hopeless task .",
    "one turns attention to some manageable substructures of it . in the previous chapter , a certain sub - structure ( the family of hypergeometric covers ) of @xmath7",
    "is suggested to be studied from the arithmetic point of view . in the current chapter , we suggest to go beyond @xmath7 , and study some infinite covers in @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that although of completely different nature , arithmetic is still present for infinite index subgroups , see for instance @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be the upper half plane with the standard action of the modular group @xmath1 ; i.e. the group of invertible @xmath14 matrices with integer coefficients .",
    "this action sends @xmath15 to @xmath16 its quotient space is called the _ modular orbifold _ and denoted @xmath17 : @xmath18 the modular orbifold has two orbifold points , @xmath19 with stabilizer @xmath20 and @xmath21 with stabilizer @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , its orbifold fundamental group is @xmath23 by the usual correspondence from topology , the subgroups of the fundamental group classify the coverings of @xmath17 .",
    "the underlying space of @xmath17 is the projective line @xmath24 , the two orbifold points with @xmath25 and @xmath26-inertia may be assumed to be respectively at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the translation @xmath29 is responsible for the puncture of the quotient which may be taken to be the point at @xmath30 .",
    "there is a degree - six galois covering of the modular orbifold by the projective line punctured at three points ; @xmath31 .",
    "therefore every covering of @xmath32 is also a covering of @xmath0 .",
    "note that every covering of @xmath17 carries a canonical hyperbolic metric induced from the poincar metric on the upper half plane .",
    "finite covers of the modular orbifold admit a combinatorial description by certain graphs ( linienzuges of klein , @xcite ) , as follows .",
    "consider the arc connecting the two elliptic points on the boundary of the standard fundamental domain of the @xmath1 action on @xmath13 , see figure  [ fig : fundamental / region ] .     on the upper half plane .",
    "]    then the @xmath1-orbit of this arc is a tree @xmath33 , which we call the _",
    "farey tree_. now by its very definition , this tree admits a @xmath1-action , and a quotient graph by a subgroup of finite or infinite index @xmath34 has been named by us a _ modular graph _ @xcite .",
    "thus the modular graph @xmath35 sits inside the curve @xmath36 in a standard way .",
    "in particular , the quotient _ orbi - graph _ @xmath37 is an arc connecting the two orbifold points of the modular orbifold @xmath38 .",
    "we call this the _ modular arc _ and denote it by @xmath39 .    from another perspective ,",
    "modular graphs are coverings ( in the orbifold sense ) of the modular arc @xmath39 .",
    "the degree-@xmath40 covers of @xmath39 are obtained by gluing @xmath40 copies of @xmath39 at the endpoints , to obtain a connected graph , so that    1 .",
    "endpoints of different types never meet , 2 .",
    "type-@xmath41 vertices are of degree either 1 or 2 , and type-@xmath42 vertices are of degree either 1 or 3 , and 3 .   for each vertex of degree 3 , a cyclic order of the edges meeting at that vertex is given .",
    "a systematic study of these graphs in connection with modular curves was made by kulkarni , under the name cyclic trivalent graphs and tree diagrams .",
    "the farey tree @xmath33 is the universal cover of @xmath39 .    perhaps the simplest modular graphs that one may draw this way ( as coverings of the modular interval ) are finite planar trivalent trees , ( with two types of terminal vertices and a puncture at infinity ) .",
    "hence we may consider finite planar trivalent trees as natural objects in @xmath43 .",
    "their belyi maps are polynomials generalizing the chebyshev polynomials .",
    "one may imagine widening the puncture of the modular orbifold @xmath17 , until the modular orbifold `` deformation retracts '' to @xmath39 inducing an isomorphism of fundamental groups .",
    "let us observe what happens to the coverings during this deformation retraction : at time @xmath27 we start with punctured surfaces , at time @xmath44 we see ribbon graphs and at time @xmath28 we get the cyclic trivalent graphs .",
    "meanwhile the universal cover of @xmath17 , i.e. the upper half plane , deformation retracts to the farey tree .",
    "one may imagine that the category @xmath45 itself is deformation retracting to @xmath46 ) , see figure  [ fig : defret ] .",
    "naming the inverse limit of @xmath47 as the _ ribbon solenoid _ , this operation gives a deformation retract of the punctured solenoid to the ribbon solenoid , which is a compact space .",
    "so we obtain :        the pointed categories @xmath48 and @xmath47 (= pointed finite modular graphs ) are equivalent via deformation retraction , and they are both arrow - reversing equivalent to @xmath3 via the fundamental group functor .    the category of modular graphs admits a _ standard _ realization by piecewise geodesic and analytic arcs of @xmath48 , via @xmath49 since there are countably many finite modular graphs , these categories admit countably many objects .",
    "the formula @xmath50 is a finite left - turn closed path .",
    "] determines the euler characteristic and hence the genus of the curve , whenever the graph is finite .",
    "in fact , we havent made use of any finiteness property in the proof , and therefore conclude more generally that the categories @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are equivalent as well .",
    "there are uncountably many infinite modular graphs , so there are as many infinite coverings of the modular orbifold , equivalently , as many subgroups of the modular graphs .",
    "if one _ erases _ vertices of degree two from a modular graph then the remaining graph becomes trivalent , i.e. every vertex is of degree @xmath54 .",
    "hence , trivalent ribbon graphs @xcite are inside @xmath55 in a natural way .",
    "there are more modular graphs than trivalent ribbon graphs since the former are allowed to have terminal edges abutting at orbifold points of both types . on the other hand , ",
    "a trivalent ribbon graph ( or an ideal triangulation ) with a distinguished oriented edge \" encountered frequently in teichmller theory ( both in the finite part , see @xcite and the infinite part , see @xcite ) is same as the data  a modular graph with the choice of a base edge \" .",
    "note that the mapping class group acts freely on the set of embedded trivalent ribbon graphs , and the groupoid associated to this group action admits a nice presentation with modular graphs as objects and graph flips as generator of morphisms , see @xcite .",
    "every triangulation of a surface has a dual graph which is an embedded trivalent ribbon graph .",
    "if we include degenerate triangulations this correspondence extends to modular graphs .",
    "this correspondence is bijective between the orientation - preserving homeomorphism classes of triangulations and trivalent ribbon graphs .",
    "conversely , any modular graph determines a covering of @xmath24 branched only at @xmath56 and @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , given a modular graph one chooses a base edge @xmath57 on the graph .",
    "then , every finite loop to a terminal vertex and back is a generator of finite order of the subgroup . ]",
    "based at @xmath57 on the graph determines an element , @xmath58 in the following way : starting with the empty word @xmath59 while tracing the loop if a degree two vertex is visited one adds an @xmath60 to @xmath59 and if a degree three vertex is visited then one writes @xmath61 ( resp .",
    "@xmath62 ) if the next edge on the loop is on the left ( resp .",
    "right ) of the initial edge",
    ". then , all such loops generate a subgroup , say @xmath34 , and as a result of the construction explained above , the orbifold @xmath63 deformation retracts onto the modular graph .",
    "in fact , the riemann surface @xmath64 can be defined over @xmath65 .",
    "every modular graph @xmath66 has a standard piecewise analytic realization on the riemann surface @xmath67 with edges being geodesic segments with respect to the hyperbolic metric induced from the upper half plane .",
    "equivalently , these edges are lifts of the modular arc by the canonical projection @xmath68 .",
    "if instead we lift the geodesic arc connecting the @xmath26-elliptic point to the cusp to the surface @xmath69 , then we obtain another graph , which is the associated _ ideal triangulation _ , i.e. a triangulation of the surface whose vertices are exactly at the punctures .",
    "lifting the remaining geodesic arc gives rise to yet another type of graph , called a _",
    "so there is a triality , not just duality , of these graphs , see figure  [ fig : triality ] .    4 cm     4 cm     4 cm     in fact , for some purposes it is more natural to study the @xmath70 of the extended modular group @xmath71 .",
    "this is the fundamental group of the quotient @xmath72 of the modular orbifold @xmath17 by the complex conjugation .",
    "we shall call @xmath72 the _ modular tile_. elements of @xmath73 are surfaces tiled by copies of @xmath72 and they include bordered surfaces with some corners and punctures , possibly lying on the boundary .",
    "every element of @xmath73 has a double which is in @xmath74 .",
    "any polygon , which is triangulated by its diagonals is an element of @xmath73 .",
    "lifts of the each one of the three edges of the modular tile to its coverings gives rise to modular graphs , triangulations , and lozenges .",
    "now that we have introduced modular graphs , the next task is to classify them .",
    "there are several schemes that come to mind , the first being with respect to genus and the number of punctures / orbifold points of the ambient surface @xmath75 .",
    "it seems natural to denote this slice of the covering category by @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the number of edges of the modular graph (= index of a corresponding subgroup ) , @xmath78 is the genus of the ambient riemann surface , @xmath40 is the number of punctures , @xmath79 is the number of orbifold points of type @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the number of orbifold points of type @xmath42 .",
    "note that these invariants are not independent and they can be defined in a purely combinatorial manner . the genus-0 case is the case of modular graphs on the sphere .",
    "the lowest value that the number of punctures @xmath40 can attain is 1 . when the genus is 0 , the case @xmath82 yields loop - free modular graphs , i.e. planar bipartite trees with vertices of type @xmath41 being of degree 1 or 2 and those of type @xmath42 being of degree 1 or 3 . we may call them `` modular trees '' .",
    "if we erase vertices of degree 2 , these are precisely the planar trivalent trees .    reasoning geometrically or combinatorially",
    ", one may imagine other ways to classify the modular graphs and operations to produce new graphs from old ones , @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to take a triangulation , simultaneously subdivide each edge into @xmath40 segments and then simultaneously subdivide every triangle into @xmath83 smaller triangles by connecting the endpoints of these segments in the obvious manner . in the previous chapter",
    "it is shown that this operation is of some relevance in the theory .",
    "there is a well - known and important class of subgroups in the panorama of the modular group .",
    "these are defined as , for positive integer @xmath84",
    "@xmath85 @xmath86 is called the _ principal modular congruence group _ and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are said to be modular groups of hecke type .",
    "the same definitions apply to the projectivizations .",
    "a subgroup of the modular group containing a principal congruence subgroup is called a _ congruence modular group _ , and the corresponding coverings of the modular orbifold are called _ modular curves_. for details ( which occupy a considerable volume in the mathematical literature ) about these subgroups",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "principal congruence subgroups are the kernels of the reduction maps onto @xmath89 and therefore they are normal subgroups . hence they correspond to galois coverings of the modular orbifold and provide us with a family of modular graphs with a transitively acting monodromy group .      the finite part @xmath7 ( or @xmath43 ) of @xmath6 ( or @xmath8 ) will be referred to as the _ tame _ part of the category because of the fact that these give rise to tale covers of the modular orbifold and conversely .",
    "all the remaining objects in the category will be called _ non - tame_. as we noted above , the full category @xmath90 admit uncountably many objects and what is beyond @xmath91 appears to be a wild territory . however , there is a subcategory of @xmath90 which consists of infinite covers of finite topology ( i.e. with finitely many punctures , boundary components and handles ) .",
    "we denote this sub - category by @xmath92 ( finitely generated infinite covers ) .",
    "once again there is the pointed category @xmath93 .",
    "as the name suggests , the corresponding subgroup category @xmath94 consists of finitely generated subgroups of infinite index in the modular group .",
    "unlike @xmath91 , it has no initial objects as the modular orbifold itself is not included in it . as a second remark ,",
    "note that an infinite cover of an object of @xmath92 may or may not be inside @xmath92 . on the other hand , this category is closed under finite covers . however , it is not true that any two objects have a common finite cover ( i.e. the intersection of two finitely generated infinite subgroups is not always a finitely generated subgroup - subgroups @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are two distinct primitive elements of infinite order . ] ) , so one can not pass to the limit of @xmath99 to define some sort of profinite completion .",
    "we see that one may consider two versions of @xmath99 , one with finite covers and the other with finite or infinite covers as morphisms .",
    "the idea is that if we restrict to finite covers then the remaining category will become entirely  arithmetic \" .",
    "taking an object in this restricted category and considering the subcategory of galois coverings of this object , one may define the fundamental group of this object to be the limit of the inverse system of galois groups of these normal covers .    in order to demystify",
    "what have been said in the above paragraphs , let us consider some examples :    the very first example is the upper half plane itself , corresponding to the trivial subgroup , which is indeed finitely generated of infinite index .",
    "observe that this is the final object of @xmath99 ( if we admit infinite coverings inside the category ) .",
    "the corresponding graph object is the bipartite farey tree itself , see figure  [ fig : farey / tree ] .",
    "observe that the action of the modular group can also be described as an action on the bipartite farey tree .",
    "this is very useful in considering graphs of arbitrary subgroups .",
    "[ ex : trivial / subgroup ]        as the next example let us consider the elliptic subgroup @xmath100 .",
    "in this case , the graph has infinitely many vertices , and @xmath60 acts on the farey tree by rotation about one of the degree @xmath101 vertices of the graph .",
    "therefore @xmath102 is obtained by folding the farey tree from the _ symmetry _ vertex , see figure  [ fig : elliptic / carks ] . in a similar fashion",
    "the matrix @xmath61 acts on the farey tree as a rotation around a degree @xmath54 vertex of degree @xmath103 , see figure  [ fig : elliptic / carks ] for the graph corresponding to @xmath104 .",
    "this depicts the general case for subgroups generated by one element of finite order .",
    "indeed , every such element is conjugate to either @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "[ ex : finite / subgroups ]     and for @xmath105 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    and for @xmath105 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    an element @xmath59 of @xmath1 is called parabolic if its absolute trace is @xmath101 . as was the case for finite subgroups , any such element is conjugate either to @xmath106 or @xmath107 for some integer @xmath108 .",
    "the corresponding graph has a unique loop ( called the _ spine _ ) containing @xmath109-many edges .",
    "there are @xmath108-many farey tree components ( called a farey branch ) attached to the degree @xmath54 vertices of the spine ( there are @xmath108 such vertices ! ) .",
    "observe that the riemann surface @xmath110 is a punctured disk .",
    "as was observed previously punctures on the riemann surface are in one to one correspondence with finite left - turn closed paths on the graph .",
    "therefore all farey branches appear either on the left or on the right of the spine , depending on the orientation and they _ expand _ in the direction of the _ outer boundary _ , see figure  [ fig : parabolic / carks ] . [ ex : parabolic / subgroups ]    . ]",
    "the remaining class of elements in @xmath1 are hyperbolic elements , i.e. those elements which are of absolute trace strictly greater than @xmath101 .",
    "modular graphs corresponding to such elements , named ark ( pronounced chark ) , again have a unique loop , which is referred to as _ spine_. for any hyperbolic element @xmath59 the riemann surface @xmath110 is an annulus .",
    "there is at least one farey branch expanding in the direction of the two boundary components , referred to as _ inner _ and _ outer_. the number of farey branches is determined solely by the element @xmath59 , see figure  [ fig : hyperbolic / carks ] for the graph corresponding to the subgroup generated by @xmath111 .",
    "[ ex : hyperbolic / subgroups ]    . ]    a hyperbolic element @xmath112 is called reciprocal if it is conjugate to its own inverse .",
    "it turns out that the element conjugating @xmath59 to @xmath113 , denoted @xmath114 , is determined uniquely up to multiplication by elements of the group @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath114 is of order @xmath101 .",
    "this reflects itself as a special symmetry of the ark corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    "namely , if a hyperbolic element @xmath59 is reciprocal , then the two words , one obtained by tracing the spine of the ark clockwise and the other counterclockwise are same , see figure  [ fig : reciprocal ] for the graph corresponding to the dihedral subgroup @xmath116 . such subgroups are related to reciprocal geodesics in the modular orbifold which are of some interest from the point of view of analytic number theory , @xcite .        given two hyperbolic elements , say @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which do not commute with each each other , the quotient of the upper half plane by the group @xmath119 is a pair of pants which is homeomorphic to a domain in @xmath120 with three boundary components each of which is sa circle .",
    "the corresponding modular graph , as in the case of arks has farey tree components expanding in the direction all three boundary components , see figure  [ fig : pair / of / pants ] for an example .     and @xmath121 . ]    any pair of elements @xmath122 and",
    "@xmath123 , of orders @xmath101 and @xmath54 respectively , generate a subgroup of @xmath1 which is isomorphic to @xmath1 itself , and this is a proper subgroup whenever the product @xmath124 is not parabolic . in this case",
    "the modular graph @xmath125 will be the planar tree with only two terminal vertices , one of type @xmath41 and the other of type @xmath42 .",
    "the above set of examples depict the general picture .",
    "that is to say , punctures on the riemann surface correspond to finite left turn loops on the graph , infinite farey branches correspond to boundaries of the riemann surface that are homotopic to the circle , etc .    to summarize the discussion , elements of @xmath126 are coverings of the modular orbifold by riemann surfaces , with a finite number of punctures , orbifold points and boundary components .",
    "note that the planar surfaces in @xmath126 are the schottky uniformizations of the modular orbifold .",
    "let us finally remark that for any object @xmath127 in @xmath128 the category @xmath129 consisting of finite covers of @xmath127 is in fact a sub - category of @xmath128 .",
    "unlike the ambient category @xmath126 , any two covers in @xmath130 has a common cover in @xmath130 .",
    "this section is devoted to the study of various arithmetic questions around modular graphs .",
    "it turns out that the tame part of the category @xmath6 admits an action of @xmath10 .",
    "the questions here , as addressed in section  [ sec : intro ] , are easy to explain .",
    "unexpectedly , there is still very beautiful arithmetic questions around the non - tame part of @xmath8 ( in fact , concerning the finitely generated infinite index subgroups , @xmath131 . )",
    "the _ absolute galois group _ @xmath10 of the field of rational numbers is the ultimate product of the classical galois theory which is laid before us as a fundamental object of study .",
    "this is a non - abelian profinite group , which is the inverse limit of galois groups of all finite galois groups of the field of rationals .",
    "the main open problem of the so - called `` inverse galois theory '' is to decide whether there exists a field extension of @xmath132 with a given finite group as its galois group .",
    "we are far from having an explicit description of this inverse system of finite groups and we are unable to pin down an element of the absolute galois group in an explicit manner , except complex conjugation .",
    "note that being profinite , the absolute galois group of @xmath132 has the structure of a compact , hausdorff , totally disconnected topological group .",
    "its size is that of the continuum .    the way to investigate a complicated group is to construct and study its action on some familiar class of objects .",
    "an action of the group @xmath10 is called a _",
    "galois action_. if the action is on a vector space and is continuous , it is usually called a _",
    "galois representation_. a continuous action of a profinite group on a discrete space or a finite - dimensional complex vector space concerns only a finite quotient of the group and can not reveal its essential structure if the group is infinite .    in order to study an infinite piece of the absolute galois group , one idea is to take all iterates @xmath133 of a given polynomial @xmath134 , and study the galois action on the tree @xmath135 whose vertices are the points @xmath136 . in case",
    "all the @xmath137s are separable , and @xmath134 is of degree @xmath77 , this is a complete rooted @xmath77-ary tree having a profinite automorphism group @xmath138 , with a continuous homomorphism @xmath139 .",
    "of course , this representation is never faithful .",
    "a systematic study of this action has started quite recently under the name arboreal galois representations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall not pursue this direction with a dynamical system flavor here , nevertheless trees will enter the scene in a different guise .",
    "note that the critical points of @xmath137 clutter so the representation we get is in a certain quotient of the fundamental group of the complement of a terrible set .",
    "a technique which proved to be very strong and fruitful to construct and study galois representations is to use algebraic geometry : @xmath140-adic tale cohomology groups attached to an algebraic variety are finite - dimensional @xmath141-vector spaces with a continuous action of @xmath10 , and the image of such representations may be infinite , although  small \" in the sense that such representations always have a  big \" kernel .",
    "the main open problem of this field is the characterization of representations of geometric origin among all linear representations ( fontaine - mazur conjecture @xcite ) .",
    "a natural next step is to study the galois actions on ( quotients of ) algebraic fundamental groups .",
    "these are called  large \" representations because they may be faithful .",
    "tale fundamental groups were introduced and studied by grothendieck in the late sixties @xcite . in this setup , if @xmath108 is a field , then the ( tale ) fundamental group of @xmath142 is @xmath143 . in the arithmetic case",
    "one can not employ the usual topological tools to define the fundamental group .",

    "we shall probably never have a satisfactory understanding of the group @xmath185 ) and the associated galois action .",
    "one may say that the galois representations on fundamental groups are  too large \" .",
    "a remedy to this problem is to consider representations on smaller quotients of fundamental groups , such as the pro - nilpotent or pro - l fundamental groups . at this point",

    "it is still  linear \" and  far from the anabelian dream imagined by grothendieck . \" for a discussion of the  non - linear \" theory , see @xcite .",
    "the hypergeometric galois actions that we proposed in the previous chapter might provide a possibility to go beyond the linear theory .",
    "if @xmath186 is a finite index subgroup of @xmath1 , then the projection @xmath187 is a belyi map , i.e. it is a covering map from the riemann surface @xmath188 to the modular orbifold @xmath17 .",
    "the latter is conformally equivalent to @xmath189 .",
    "compactifying by adding a point at infinity , we get the riemann sphere and the orbifold covering @xmath190 can be viewed as a branched covering @xmath191 branched at elliptic points and at infinity . branching at elliptic points is restricted whereas there is no restriction on the branching above the point at infinity .",
    "this is no loss of generality as there is a degree @xmath192 covering from @xmath193 to the modular orbifold . by belyi s theorem this branched",
    "covering admits a model whose defining polynomials have coefficients from a number field ( i.e. a finite extension of @xmath132 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath188 is defined over a number field .",
    "such curves will be called _",
    "arithmetic curves_. this allows us to define an action of the absolute galois group on @xmath91 , or equivalently on the category of modular graphs .    by belyi s theorem",
    "every arithmetic curve arises as a covering of @xmath193 and hence the modular orbifold : arithmetic curves are precisely the compactifications of the covering curves inside @xmath91 . as we already noted above ,",
    "every arithmetic curve will appear in @xmath91 in infinitely many ways , i.e. @xmath194 will appear as many times as the number of trivalent graphs drawn on the sphere .",
    "the last example illustrates why we consider the action of the galois group on the coverings ( curve plus the covering ) , and not just on the curves .",
    "the arithmetic curve here is just @xmath194 which is defined over @xmath132 and so the action is trivial , whereas the action becomes faithful when we consider the coverings as well .      1 .   the number of edges in the modular graph , equivalently , the degree of the branched covering ; 2 .",

    ".   monodromy group .    as the aim is to understand @xmath10 , one looks for families of arithmetic curves supporting a faithful action of @xmath10 .",
    "it appears that there are many candidates for this .",
    "motivated by the above list one may first try fixing the genus , @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , for any non - trivial element @xmath171 of @xmath10 one can easily find an algebraic number , say @xmath195 , on which @xmath171 acts non - trivially .",
    "then , if @xmath196 is an elliptic curve with @xmath197 invariant @xmath195 , then @xmath196 and @xmath198 are distinct elliptic curves .",
    "hence genus @xmath28 arithmetic curves admit a faithful @xmath10 action . by belyi s theorem",
    "every such curve corresponds to a modular graph of genus @xmath28 .",
    "the conclusion is that the galois action on the set of modular graphs of genus 1 is faithful .",
    "one can also show that the same is true for genus @xmath27 curves .",
    "more generally , we have :          there are a myriad of questions related to the arithmetic surrounding the theory built so far , and there is a vast literature about these questions .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for further reading .",
    "we do not pursue here this ",
    "finite \" side of the theory further , which is devoted to the study of @xmath199 of _ finite _ coverings of the modular orbifold , and we turn our attention to the study of some special infinite covers .      at this stage , the reader will probably expect us to define a galois action on @xmath200 , where @xmath201 is an object in @xmath6 exactly as in the finite case .",
    "likewise for the ambient category @xmath92 .",
    "this requires an interpretation of the elements and morphisms of this category as arithmetic objects over some field , which is possibly some transcendental extension of @xmath132 depending on @xmath201 .",
    "we firmly believe that such an interpretation does exist and is fruitful , however , we do nt know how to make this .",
    "instead we will give an alternative arithmetic interpretation of hyperbolic @xmath161-covers from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath202 be a hyperbolic element in @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath203 . the action of @xmath59 on @xmath204 has two fixed points , determined by roots of the following integral equation : @xmath205 since solutions of the above equation remains fixed when one takes non - zero multiples of the coefficients , the above equation can be reduced to : @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 . note that hyperbolicity of the matrix implies that the equation has two real roots .",
    "there is a unique geodesic in @xmath204 joining these two fixed points , called the _ geodesic of _ @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , the action of @xmath59 on @xmath204 is nothing but a _ translation _ along this geodesic .",

    "this form will be denoted by @xmath213 .",
    "conversely , given any triple @xmath214 with @xmath215 being positive and the greatest common divisor of @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 being @xmath28 , by solving a suitable pell equation , one can find a hyperbolic element of @xmath1 , @xmath59 , so that @xmath219      there is a one to one correspondence between @xmath1-classes of binary quadratic forms and conjugacy classes of subgroups of @xmath1 generated by one hyperbolic element .",
    "[ thm : correspondence / between / forms / and / subgroups ]    as described in example  [ ex : hyperbolic / subgroups ] such modular graphs have a unique loop ( called the spine ) , and finitely many farey branches expanding in the direction of both connected components of the boundary of the annulus , @xmath220",
    ".    given two forms @xmath221 and @xmath222 there is a product defined by gau , @xcite , if and only if either @xmath223 or @xmath224 is a perfect square .",
    "in particular the set of all forms of discriminant @xmath225 is a group under this operation .",
    "the function mapping a binary quadratic form @xmath226 of discriminant @xmath227 to the narrow ideal class generated by @xmath228 , where @xmath229 in the quadratic number field @xmath230 is a group isomorphism .",
    "therefore , given a square - free positive integer @xmath225 , finding the class number of the number field @xmath230 , i.e. the size of the class group of @xmath230 , is equivalent to finding the number of inequivalent @xmath1 classes of indefinite binary quadratic forms of same discriminant .",
    "the latter set of problems , which are now older than 200 years , the class number problems of gau , and are all stated in disquisitiones arithmeticae , @xcite .",
