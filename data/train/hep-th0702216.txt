    "the primordial perturbations responsible for the anisotropies in the cmb @xcite are likely to have originated as quantum fluctuations of a scalar field @xmath0 , the inflaton , that was the dominant constituent of the universe during a period of rapid exponential inflation @xcite that lasted long enough to allow all parts of our observed universe to be causally connected .",
    "the potential - energy density of the inflaton field provided the impetus for the inflationary expansion , while its quantum fluctuations upon leaving the hubble event horizon during inflation provided the initial conditions for the metric and density perturbations at the beginning of the radiation - dominated stage of the expansion ( see , for example , the books @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the following typical slow - roll inflationary scenario , which is consistent with the three - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations @xcite . as first shown by the author @xcite",
    ", the generation and amplification of quantum fluctuations of a scalar field , such as the inflaton , is inevitable during an expansion of the universe like that of inflation .",
    "the metric during exponential inflation is @xmath1 with @xmath2 given by @xmath3 where g is newton s constant and @xmath4 is the inflaton potential .",
    "the zeroth - order inflaton field @xmath5 is treated classically .",
    "it and @xmath2 change very gradually in slow - roll inflation as @xmath5 rolls slowly down the potential toward a minimum .",
    "the inflaton field to first order is written as @xmath6 the first - order perturbation obeys the minimally - coupled linear scalar field equation on the background metric : @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the conditions of slow - roll inflation imply that @xmath9 , from which it follows that @xmath10 is small with respect to @xmath11 . for inflationary potentials that are usually considered and",
    "are consistent with the wmap data , @xmath10 is positive and nearly constant during inflation .",
    "this is a convenient framework in which to illustrate our main point , namely , that the subtractions required for the renormalization of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences in the two - point function reduce by several orders of magnitude the amplitude of the inflaton fluctuations at the times when their wavelengths leave the hubble horizon , as compared with the results that are generally found in the literature .",
    "the method of adiabatic regularization that determines the subtraction terms has been known for many years @xcite .",
    "below , we find that the adiabatic subtractions that bring the uv divergences of the two - point function under control have a very significant effect on the amplitude of the two - point function at the frequencies corresponding to exit of the inflaton perturbations from the inflationary hubble horizon . a pedagogical explanation of the adiabatic subtraction method as it applies to the two - point function and the energy - momentum tensor is given in the book @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although it is clear that inflation is not an adiabatic ( slow ) expansion of the universe , nevertheless , from the point of view of the short - wavelength , short - period fluctuations that give rise to the uv divergences of the two - point function , the hubble period , @xmath12 , of the inflationary expansion is long , so the inflationary expansion appears adiabatic at very high uv frequencies .",
    "thus , adiabatic regularization and subtraction is applicable to the two - point function of the quantized inflaton perturbation field during inflation .",
    "we show that the amplitudes of these perturbations will be reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to their amplitudes without the adiabatic subtractions .",
    "this effect is crucial when considering fundamental physical theories that predict the value of @xmath2 during inflation .",
    "it will change previous results in the literature that showed that certain fundamental theories seemed to give perturbations from inflation that were too large by orders of magnitude .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath13 that appears in @xmath14 above covers a part of desitter spacetime .",
    "the well - known normalized positive - frequency solution of the above differential equation for the field @xmath15 that is determined to within a constant phase factor by the desitter isometries of spatial rotations and translations , and by the desitter extension of time translation , is @xmath16 with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a hankel function of the first kind , and @xmath20 in the present analysis , we are treating @xmath2 and @xmath21 as constant to first approximation during inflation . note that @xmath22 is the ratio of the radius of the hubble horizon @xmath12 to the wavelength of the inflaton perturbation @xmath23 . for a given value of @xmath24 ,",
    "the convention is to define the time of exit of the corresponding mode from the hubble horizon as the time when @xmath25 .",
    "we have temporarily imposed periodic boundary conditions on the modes @xmath26 in a spatial cube of volume @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is taken to infinity in the continuum limit .",
    "the hermitian quantized field @xmath29 is expressed as usual in the mode expansion @xmath30 where denotes the hermitian conjugate of the previous term , and @xmath31 is an annihilation operator for a particle of the quantized inflaton perturbation field in mode @xmath26 .",
    "the desitter or bunch - davies vacuum state @xmath32 is defined by @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "we are working in the heisenberg picture , and expectation values below are taken with respect to this state vector .",
    "this vacuum state is a natural one to take for the inflaton perturbation field in the exponentially expanding inflationary universe .",
    "the formal two - point function @xmath35 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaphi ] ) is @xmath36 where we have taken the continuum limit . from the large - k asymptotic form of the hankel function ,",
    "one finds that this integral over k diverges quadratically at the upper limit of integration .",
    "well established methods have been developed to deal with such uv divergences that arise in quantum field theory in curved spacetime , as normal ordering of operators is not sufficient in an evolving universe .",
    "the method that best suits our present objective of finding the _ spectrum _ of perturbations is the method of adiabatic regularization first developed by parker and fulling .",
    "the method involves a mode by mode subtraction of terms that are related to the behavior of the mode functions in a slowly ( i.e. , adiabatically ) expanding universe .",
    "adiabatic regularization is related to the fact that the particle number is an adiabatic invariant @xcite in a slowly expanding universe .",
    "even the rate of the inflationary expansion is slow relative to the high frequencies that give rise to the uv divergence .",
    "the adiabatic subtractions are obtained from an adiabatic series for the mode functions .",
    "they serve to identify and eliminate the uv divergences that are present in quantities such as the two - point function and expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the method is very simple to apply in the friedmann , lemaitre , robertson , walker ( flrw ) background metrics , such as that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) .",
    "the adiabatically regularized expression for the two - point function is @xmath37 where the first adiabatic subtraction term removes the quadratic uv divergence and the second subtraction removes the logarithmic uv divergence that is present in the formal expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : formal2point ] ) .",
    "the full expression in the integrand is well - defined and gives a finite result , even though if one were to break apart the separate integrals , they would each suffer from a uv divergence .",
    "here @xmath38 , and for the present exponentially expanding universe and field equation , the second subtraction term is @xmath39 the adiabatic subtractions must be taken at all frequencies , not just large ones .",
    "otherwise fundamental properties would be violated ; for example , the covariant four - divergence of the renormalized energy - momentum tensor would not be zero .",
    "the two - point function is related to the spectrum of inflaton perturbations ( @xmath40 , also denoted as @xmath41 ) by @xmath42 comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eq : renorm2point ] ) , one finds @xmath43 this is equivalent to the definition of the spectrum as @xcite : @xmath44 where we define the renormalized momentum - space expectation value as @xmath45 as we have seen , consistency between the physically relevant renormalized two - point functions in position space and momentum space demands that the physically relevant perturbations in momentum space are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrumandsubtractions ] ) .    having obtained the momentum - space two - point function of eq .",
    "( [ eq : renormmode2point ] ) directly from the renormalized position - space two - point function , one may ask if there is an alternative argument for the physical relevance of the subtractions that deals with the individual momentum - space modes in the expansion of the quantized field ?",
    "such an argument can be found in the author s ph.d .",
    "thesis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which quantum measurement theory was used to redefine the creation and annihilation operators that are measurable for each mode in the expansion of the field analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaphi ] ) .",
    "the modes in the field expansion , when expressed in terms of these physically relevant creation and annihilation operators , would lead to the result for the momentum - space two - point function given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : renormmode2point ] ) , with the vacuum state being the one annihilated by the physical annihilation operators . in the present case",
    ", the connection with quantum measurement theory can be thought of in terms of the classical curvature perturbations that give the initial conditions for the radiation - dominated stage of our universe .",
    "the classical curvature perturbations that arise from the quantum inflaton perturbations can be regarded as making a measurement on them , with the readout of this measuring instrument being the observed power spectrum of the cmb .    simply defining the spectrum @xmath40 by using the fourier components in the field expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaphi ] ) would give for @xmath46 the result on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : renormmode2point ] ) , but _ without _ any of the adiabatic subtractions",
    ". then the position space two - point function @xmath47 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrumand2point ] ) would be infinite .",
    "one may try to tame this infinity by the _ ad hoc _ prescription of demanding that @xmath48 approach @xmath49 rapidly at sufficiently large @xmath24 . in this procedure ,",
    "one obtains for the modes of interest : @xmath50 however , this _ ad hoc _ procedure does not correctly take into account the fact that the physically relevant spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrumandsubtractions ] ) is significantly different from the _ ad hoc _ spectrum obtained by this cut - off procedure .",
    "another often used procedure@xcite is to combine the ad hoc cut - off idea with a method of putting boundary conditions on the mode functions such that the end result is to find the same result as eq .",
    "( [ eq : adhocspectrum1 ] ) , but with @xmath51 . this gives , for the modes of interest , the spectrum @xmath52 without the cut - off , this would also give an infinite position - space two - point function .    at horizon exit ( @xmath25 ) it turns out that for small values of @xmath10 , the last two spectra are related by @xmath53 .",
    "it is our contention that neither of these last two spectra are correct because they do not take account of the subtraction terms that are necessary for renormalization in curved spacetime .",
    "next we compare the actual physically relevant spectrum with the two _ ad hoc _ spectra .",
    "we will find that the near scale - independence of the spectral components at the times of exit from the hubble horizon is not altered , but the magnitudes are quite different .",
    "thus , the _ agreement _ with cmb observations is not altered .",
    "but for comparison of the observations with theories that predict the magnitude of the hubble parameter @xmath2 during inflation , the difference in amplitude between the actual spectrum and the two _ ad hoc _ spectra is quite important .",
    "as noted , exit from the hubble horizon is defined in the literature as occurring for each inflaton perturbation mode at the time when @xmath25 , where @xmath54 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nv ] ) . expressing each of the spectra given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spectrumandsubtractions ] ) , ( [ eq : adhocspectrum1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : adhocspectrum2 ] ) in terms of @xmath54 , we find that the spectrum we are proposing is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the other two spectra are , respectively , @xmath58 and @xmath59 when @xmath60 and @xmath61 , one has for the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltasquared - omega ] ) , @xmath62 , which is the result used in the literature .",
    "we are proposing that instead one should use the result obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltasquared ] )",
    ".    all three of these spectra depend on the mode @xmath24 only through the variable @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the spectra obtained from the modes as they exit the hubble horizon will be scale - invariant in each case and will give rise to scale - invariant initial curvature perturbations at the beginning of the radiation - dominated stage of the expansion .",
    "( because @xmath2 depends on the unperturbed classical inflaton field @xmath5 , which is slowly rolling down the inflaton potential , there will be some deviation from the scale - invariant spectrum , as is observed and has been thoroughly analysed @xcite . )",
    "the value of @xmath63 , depends on the inflaton potential and is small with respect to @xmath64 , but non - zero , in slow - roll inflation . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the proposed physical two - point function of eq .",

    "the amplitude is in units of @xmath11 .",
    "the quantity @xmath66 is @xmath64 at horizon exit . ]",
    "a notable feature of the proposed physical two - point function spectrum is that the amplitude of the perturbations is significantly smaller than the value used in the literature .",
    "earlier conclusions in the literature ( for example , @xcite ) that the amplitude predicted by certain theories ( such as grand unified theories ) was too large by several orders of magnitude will have to be reconsidered in light of the present correction to the spectrum . in table",

    ".comparison of spectra at @xmath60 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that the proposed physical spectrum has an amplitude at horizon exit that decreases with decreasing @xmath21 and , for the values of @xmath21 shown , is from one- to four - powers of @xmath70 smaller than the unrenormalized spectra .",
    "it is not difficult to prove from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltasquared ] ) that when @xmath71 , the subtraction terms give the exact result that @xmath72 for _ all _ @xmath54 . this is a remarkable result , in view of the fact that without the adiabatic subtractions the massless minimally - coupled field has a _ formal _ two - point function in position space that is infinite in the desitter ( bunch - davies ) vacuum state because of an ir divergence ( as well as the uv divergence ) .",
    "the adiabatic subtractions are determined by the need to cancel the uv divergences .",
    "there is no freedom to change them at the ir end of the spectrum .",
    "the cancellation of the ir divergence by the same subtractions that tame the uv divergence appears to be fortuitous , but may have a deeper significance , perhaps pointing to a duality between ir and uv behavior .",
    "it was first shown by ford and parker ( * ? ? ?",

    "( 3.26 ) ) , for the mode functions that define the bunch - davies de sitter vacuum state , that the formal two - point function of the massless , minimally - coupled scalar field in this vacuum state has an infrared ( ir ) divergence .",
    "the existence of a similar ir divergence for the de sitter vacuum state that has the full set of desitter symmetries , including global discrete space and time reflections on the de sitter hypersphere , was found by allen @xcite .",
    "this ir divergence has been taken as a reason to reject the desitter vacuum as a possible vacuum state of the minimally - coupled scalar field when @xmath73 .",
    "but as we have seen , this ir divergence is cancelled and the _ physical _ two - point function of this massless field in the bunch davies vacuum turns out to be exactly zero instead of infinity . to our knowledge",
