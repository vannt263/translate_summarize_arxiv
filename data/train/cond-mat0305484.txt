    "recent experimental studies of new types of magnetoresistance oscillations in a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in a magnetic field  @xcite , particularly the observation of vanishing electrical resistance caused by microwave radiation , have stimulated extensive efforts to clarify the origin of the uncovered phenomena .",
    "the occurrence of the effect of the so - called zero - resistance states is closely associated with the effect of absolute negative conductivity ( anc ) when the dissipative dc conductivity @xmath0 is negative  @xcite .",
    "mechanisms of anc in a 2des subjected to a magnetic field under nonequilibrium conditions , in particular under irradiation with microwaves , have been studied theoretically since the late 60s  @xcite .",
    "one can speculate that the photon - assisted impurity scattering  @xcite is the main mechanism of anc causing the zero - resistance states .",
    "notwithstanding this , a revision of alternate possible mechanisms of anc may be of interest as well .    in this paper",
    ", we show that anc can occur owing to the electron - phonon scattering ( acoustical ) if a 2des is not in equilibrium with the phonon system .",
    "the deviation of the 2des and the acoustic phonon systems from equilibrium can be caused , in particular , by the electron heating due to the absorption of microwaves or infrared radiation accompanied by the transitions between the landau levels ( ll s ) or the intersubband transitions .",
    "this is consistent with the concept considered previously  @xcite .",
    "here we derive the expression for the dc dissipative component of the 2des conductivity @xmath0 as a function of the phonon ( lattice ) and 2des ( electron ) temperatures , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , considering the electron interaction with acoustic phonons .",
    "after that , we calculate @xmath2 for the case of the electron heating by microwave radiation due to the absorption associated with the photon - assisted electron scattering on the phonons of the same type .",
    "we show that at sufficiently high electron temperatures ( sufficiently strong radiation ) , the dissipative dc conductivity associated with the electron - phonon interaction can become negative , i.e. , the electron heating can lead to the effect of anc .",
    "the thermal mechanism of anc under consideration can markedly influence the transport properties of a 2des affected by microwave or infrared radiation .",

( 7 ) , one can show that @xmath0 becomes negative when    @xmath75    where @xmath76 . the origin of anc in such a situation is due to the following .",
    "when the electron temperature exceeds the lattice temperature , the balance between the processes of the phonon absorption accompanied by electron transitions to higher ll s and the processes of the phonon emission accompanied by electron transitions to lower ll s is violated , and the processes of the latter type dominate .",
    "the processes associated with the emission of a phonon with energy less than the ll separation provide a negative contribution to the dissipative conductivity , whereas those with the energy exceeding this separation yield a positive contribution .",
    "since the probability of the emission of a phonon with a lower energy is larger , the net contribution of the electron scattering processes involving the emission of phonons can be negative if the electron temperature is sufficiently large compared to the lattice temperature .",
    "let us consider the situation when the 2des under consideration is heated by incoming microwave radiation . in this case",
    ", the electron distribution over ll s is determined by the balance between the electron relaxation associated with the emission of acoustic phonons and the processes of the electron heating caused by the photon - assisted absorption / emission of such phonons .",

    "this occurs even at the cyclotron resonance @xmath101 since an increase in @xmath102 at fixed microwave intensity is limited by the ll broadening : @xmath103^{-1}$ ] .",

    ", the electron heating can occur due to other photon - assisted events .",
    "it is instructive that the dependence of the electron temperature on the resonance detuning @xmath105 is virtually an even function of the latter if @xmath106 .",
    "when the resonance detuning is sufficiently large @xmath107 , the electron temperature becomes a markedly asymmetric function of @xmath105 , particularly at very low lattice temperatures .",
    "indeed , in such a range of detuning , from eq .",

    "figure  2 shows the normalized dissipative conductivity @xmath129 as a function of the parameter @xmath135 at different values of the detuning @xmath136 .",
    "one can see from figs .  1 and 2 that at sufficiently large @xmath137 , i.e. , at sufficiently low lattice temperatures , the ratio @xmath129 as a function of @xmath138 and @xmath139 exhibits pronounced minima at which it can be negative .",

    "naturally , when the dark conductivity is determined by another mechanism than the acoustic phonon scattering , the occurrence of anc requires a larger microwave power .",
    "the electron interaction with interface acoustic phonons can also contribute to the mechanism of anc under consideration .",
    "however , the dissipative conductivity associated with the electron scattering on 2d acoustic phonons is smaller than that associated with the scattering on 3d phonons by a large factor @xmath147 $ ]  @xcite . due to this",
    ", the variation of the dissipative conductivity caused by the electron heating is rather small . on the contrary",
    ", the contribution of the photon - assisted electron interaction with 2d phonons to the absorption of microwave radiation and , therefore , to the electron heating can be pronounced .",
    "the latter ( extra ) heating mechanism can result in an additional deepening of the conductivity minima .",
    "thus , the electron interaction with acoustic phonons can lead to anc in a 2des irradiated with microwaves .",
    "as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and here , two `` acoustic '' mechanisms of anc are possible : ( 1 ) the dynamic mechanism associated with the direct contribution of the photon - assisted scattering processes to the dissipative conductivity and ( 2 ) the thermal mechanism at which the microwave radiation increases the electron temperature that , in turn , affects the dissipative conductivity . comparing the dynamic and thermal variations of the dissipative conductivity caused by irradiation , one can determine that their ratio does not include any parameter significantly different from unity . hence , both the mechanisms in question can be simultaneously essential .",
    "however , these mechanisms lead to substantially different spectral behavior of the dissipative conductivity .    at the electron heating associated with the intersubband transitions stimulated by infrared radiation",
    ", the dissipative conductivity can also become negative , exhibiting , however , a rather smooth ( nonresonant ) dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "the mechanism of anc considered above is due to a difference between the the electron and phonon temperatures .",
    "therefore , the dissipative conductivity in a 2des subjected to a magnetic field can be negative not only at @xmath148 but at @xmath149 as well ( see ref .",
    "we demonstrated a possibility of the thermal mechanism of negative dissipative dc conductivity in a 2des subjected to a magnetic field associated with the interaction of electrons with acoustic phonons at a difference between the electron and phonon temperatures .",
    "as an example , the electron heating by microwave radiation is considered .",
    "it was shown that in this case , both dynamic and thermal mechanisms can be efficient to result in anc at sufficiently strong microwave radiation in certain ranges of its frequency .",
