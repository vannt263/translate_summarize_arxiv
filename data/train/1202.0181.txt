    "there is a consensus both in theoretical@xcite and experimental frameworks , the latter coming from observations of the sn1987a@xcite , that a supernova explosion is preceeded by a huge neutrino flux of all flavours and their antiparticles . in principle , large neutrino telescopes are able to disentangle the neutrino burst signal from the background fluctuations , and to sample data with statistical significance to build the neutrino energy spectrum . the method proposed in this work",
    "is dedicated to estimate the distance from the collapsing star , i.e. the supernova explosion , by using only the information of the spectral shape from expected @xmath0 events on neutrino telescopes , as well as assumptions on the total binding energy of the stellar core released in the collapsing process . in this preliminary phase our discussion",
    "is focused on the errors of the method related to the theoretical uncertainties concerning the energy released in the formation of the compact object from the collapsing star .",
    "the distance from a galactic sn explosion determined by other methods can present some difficulties , for instance , the optical counterpart from galactic neutrino bursts can be fainted , introducing large errors in traditional photometry , or even obscured by the disk matter , making measurements in the visible spectrum completely unfeasible .",
    "triangulation with other neutrino telescopes could result in large angular errors .",
    "parameter scanning in data analysis is a possibility . in this case",
    ", the result of this method can be used as an independent input , or even as a prior in other statiscal methods such as a bayesian approach .",
    "the number of expected events in a neutrino telescope , @xmath1 , is given by the expression : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of target particles , @xmath4 is the sn neutrino spectrum , @xmath5 is the cross - section of the neutrino interaction to be detected and @xmath6 is the detection efficiency .",
    "d is the sn distance we are trying to estimate from data analysis .",
    "supernova neutrino spectra are generally calculated by numerical methods and were obtained by different groups .",
    "we adopt the most standard approach , a fermi - dirac spectrum with a temperature t and a non - thermal parameter @xmath7 ( pseudo - degeneracy ) @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 the normalization imposed by the total energy @xmath11 emitted as neutrinos , @xmath12 is the fermi integral of 3rd order .",
    "an important issue of the method is that @xmath11 can be related to the binding energy @xmath13 released in stellar collapse , since 99% of @xmath13 is carried away by neutrinos .",
    "the binding energy @xmath13 is given by@xcite : @xmath14 .",
    "considering that @xmath15 is tightly bound to the chandrasekhar mass ( 1.2 - 1.4)@xmath16 and @xmath17 is the neutron star radius ( 12 - 15 km ) , thus @xmath13 is within a rather narrow range and consequently @xmath11 is constrained between @xmath18 . from eq.[numeventos ] one can see that an observation of a given number of counts by an experiment result as information only the ratio @xmath19 , i.e the normalization of the total neutrino flux diluted by the square of the collapse distance .",
    "we can go further if only from the @xmath0 spectral shape the parameters ( t,@xmath7 ) could be determined . since @xmath11 is constrained as described above , by assuming a standard value for @xmath11 within a conservative range , it is possible to obtain the propper normalization constant for eq.[espectro ] rather accurately .",
    "then , we can solve eq.[numeventos ] for the distance @xmath20 , as it is the last free parameter .",
    "the method can be summarized as follows : * 1 . *",
    "a neutrino telescope measures @xmath0 events and builds their energy spectrum . *",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test is applied over data to determine spectral parameters ( t , @xmath7 ) .",
    "ks - test was specially chosen since is a test for shapes and it does not depend on relative normalizations of the distributions , thus at this step , @xmath11 and d are not relevant .",
    "* counts from step 1 . and parameters from data analysis ( step 2 .",
    ") are then used as inputs on the eq.[numeventos ] , which is solved for d , by assuming as a prior the conservative , but nonetheless restrictive assumption @xmath21 erg as discussed before .",
    "we expect that the narrow range in @xmath11 can have minimum impact over the distance estimation .",
    "simulations were used to evaluate the method sensitivity , as described in the next section .",
    "we selected for simulation the following parameters : * ( i ) * neutrino spectrum@xcite : t= 3.0 mev , @xmath22 ; * ( ii ) * @xmath23 erg ; * ( iii ) * @xmath24 = 10 kpc .",
    "as a first case study we have taken the lvd experiment @xcite , running at the gran sasso underground laboratory ( italy ) with 1 kton of active scintillator mass , @xmath25 target protons .",
    "the energy threshold was taken as @xmath26 .",
    "for simplicity , we have made @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 simulation steps : * 1)statistical fluctuations : * @xmath1 is calculated from eq.[numeventos ] , and then a random number is draw from a poissonian distribution with mean @xmath1 , obtaining a new number of events @xmath29 * ; * * 2)simulation of experimental @xmath0 spectrum : * @xmath29 values of energy are then draw following the distribution given by the integrand of eq.[numeventos ] * ; * * 3 ) experimental uncertainties : * each energy value from step ( 2 ) was properly fluctuated accordingly the energy resolution of the experiment@xcite * ; * * 4)systematics induced by uncertainties : * events bellow energy threshold are discarded * * ; * * * 5)end of the data set modelling : * the resulting set of values are used as simulated experimental events to work as the neutrino energy spectrum**. * *    @xmath28 analysis : in the proposed method , the ks - test is applied in a non - orthodox way : we scan a reasonable range for t and @xmath7 in very small steps , assuming each scanned pair ( t , @xmath7 ) as a null hypothesis for the neutrino emission , @xmath30 .",
    "the ( t , @xmath7 ) with greater ks probability pointed from the scan is chosen as the `` best parametrization '' ( t,@xmath7)@xmath31 . the corresponding values @xmath29 , ( t,@xmath7)@xmath31 , and the assumption for the analysis @xmath32 erg , are then used to solve eq.[numeventos ] , as described before to obtain d. the fig.[cont - dist ] shows in plane ( t , @xmath7 ) the results for ks probability , obtained from the simulated spectra .",
    "regardless the uncertainties that were introduced , only a small region of the parameter space has significant probability to be recognized as neutrino emission parameters .",
    "moreover , the region s boundary suggests a parameter correlation , explained by the mutually inverse action of parameters t and @xmath7 in the shape of the neutrino spectrum . in our study",
    "the best parametrization was found at ( t,@xmath7)@xmath31 = ( 2.9 , 3.1 ) .",
    "the distribution of distances we found solving eq.[numeventos ] by selecting only the spectral parameters with ks - probability @xmath33 is also shown in figure [ cont - dist ] . despite the fluctuations that were introduced we have accurately determined the distance @xmath34 kpc .",
    "we also tested the opposite limit , simulating the sn explosion with @xmath35 erg but still assuming @xmath36 erg in the simulated data analysis , resulting in @xmath37 kpc .    ) .",
    "the circle and dashed lines highlights ( t,@xmath7)@xmath31 .",
    "right : distribution of distances d found as solutions of eq.[numeventos ] only for simulated data with ks - probability greater than 0.9.,scaledwidth=88.0% ]",
    "the method to estimate the sn distance by neutrino spectral shape is very promising and was tested through simulations . when @xmath38 , we have obtained errors @xmath39 , meanwhile by testing over extreme limits , i.e. simulating the sn explosion with the lowest plausible energy and still assuming in the simulated data analysis the maximum plausible value for @xmath11 ( see text for details ) we have obtained errors @xmath40 . enhancements on the simulations",
    "should be done by including different parameterization of neutrino spectra and more details on experimental uncertainties .",
    "studies on the statistical distribution of @xmath11 should also be considered to obtain a more robust evaluation of the sensitivity of the method ."
