    "weyl semimetal is a three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological state of matter , in which the conduction and valence energy bands touch at a finite number of nodes @xcite .",
    "the nodes always appear in pairs , in each pair the quasiparticles ( dubbed weyl fermions ) carry opposite chirality and linear dispersion , much like a 3d analog of graphene .",
    "the neutrino used to be a potential candidate for the weyl fermion , until its tiny mass was revealed . in the past few years , a number of condensed matter systems have been suggested to host weyl fermions @xcite .",
    "most recently , the signatures of weyl nodes have been observed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , scanning tunneling microscopy , and time - domain terahertz spectroscopy in ( bi@xmath0in@xmath1)@xmath2se@xmath3 @xcite , na@xmath4bi @xcite , cd@xmath4as@xmath5 @xcite , and tlbisse @xcite ( strictly speaking , they are dirac semimetals in which the paired weyl nodes are degenerate @xcite ) .",
    "excellent electronic transport is anticipated in weyl semimetals .",
    "the weyl nodes remain gapless unless being annihilated in pairs .",
    "it is known that disorder may induce a semimetal to metal transition @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , metals may also exhibit `` insulating '' behaviors as a result of disorder and quantum interference , i.e. , anderson localization @xcite .",
    "in contrast , because of the symplectic symmetry @xcite near each weyl node , the weyl fermions are immune from anderson localization and tend to be `` antilocalized '' , in the absence of interaction and intervalley scattering .",
    "one of the signatures of the weak antilocalization is a negative magnetoconductivity , and has been observed recently in bi@xmath6sb@xmath7 @xcite with a theoretical description based on a corrected semiclassical boltzmann equation @xcite , zrte@xmath8 @xcite , and taas @xcite .",
    "however , to include the weak ( anti-)localization corrections , higher - order feynman diagrams @xcite beyond the semiclassical transport theory have to be taken into account .",
    "a full three - dimensional calculation beyond the semiclassical @xcite and quasi - two - dimensional @xcite regimes is still lacking for this paradigmatic system , in particular in the presence of many - body interaction and multi - valley effects .    in this work , we systematically study the temperature and magnetic field dependences of the conductivity of a two - valley weyl semimetal . with the help of feynman diagram techniques , we take into account high - order corrections from the quantum interference as well as the interplay of interaction and disorder beyond the semiclassical transport theory .",
    "we find that the low - temperature magnetoconductivity is negative and follows a square - root law in weak magnetic fields @xmath9 , ( i.e. , a @xmath10 magnetoconductivity ) ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mc ] ) arising from the weak antilocalization , which is in consistence with the experiments @xcite .",
    "however , despite this magnetoconductivity signature of the weak antilocalization , the temperature dependence of the conductivity still shows a tendency to localization below a critical temperature , as a result of weak many - body interaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma - t ] ) . moreover , intervalley scattering and correlation may also strengthen the localization tendency ( see fig .",
