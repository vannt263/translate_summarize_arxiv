    "a quantum particle moving in a random potential undergoes anderson localization quantum phase transition in three dimensions with increasing of the strength of disorder @xcite .",
    "the order parameter characterizing the localized phase is the inverse localization length @xmath0 @xcite , describing the exponential decay of the envelope of eigenstates .",
    "when the critical point is being approached from the localized phase , localization length , which depends for a given energy only on the strength of the disorder , increases with decreasing of the disorder strength and finally diverges as a power - law at a particular disorder strength",
    ". further decrease of disorder strength then makes the eigenstate extended throughout the whole system .",
    "simultaneously , on length scales smaller than the localization length , eigenstates exhibit multifractal scaling behavior characterized by anomalous scaling of the inverse participation numbers ( for definitions and references , see sec .",
    "[ multifractality ] ) .",
    "this basic phenomena , together with the work of thouless on the scaling of conductance in finite - size systems @xcite , led to the scaling theory of localization @xcite , one of the main consequences of which is the absence of extended states in two dimensional disordered systems , with two dimensions being the lower critical dimension of the transition .",
    "if the spin - orbit interaction is present , however , picture changes and two dimensional systems from symplectic ensemble exhibit localization transition even in two dimensions as opposed to systems from orthogonal ensemble which have all states localized @xcite . presence of the strong magnetic field in two dimensional disordered systems , on the other hand , leads to a completely different behavior  the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe )  where critical states are present at the middle of each of disorder - broadened landau levels @xcite .",
    "another class of models exhibiting localization properties different from the systems mentioned above are systems with chiral ( particle - hole ) symmetry .",
    "such systems are defined on a bipartite lattice with only hopping ( off - diagonal or bond- ) disorder .",
    "wegner was first to realize the importance of this symmetry in disordered systems @xcite , and even one - dimensional systems with this symmetry are known to have peculiar properties , such as diverging dos at the band center @xcite , where the eigenstate decays as @xmath1 @xcite , in contrast to one - dimensional site - disordered systems which have dos bounded @xcite and all states localized .",
    "there are several models with chiral symmetry that have been extensively studied . the simplest two , in the sense that only one orbital per site and nearest neighbor hopping are included , time - reversal symmetry present and the spin not relevant , are the anderson bond - disordered model ( abd ) @xcite and the random dirac fermion model ( rdf ) @xcite .",
    "the main difference between these two models is that , in the non - disordered case , abd model has a line of points as the fermi surface at half - filling while rdf has a point fermi surface and linear dispersion of energies .",
    "this work is concerned with the abd model on a square lattice of size @xmath2 and periodic boundary conditions , defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath3 where brackets denote neighboring sites on the lattice , @xmath4 is annihilation operator of the electron at site @xmath5 , and @xmath6 s are uniformly distributed random variables @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "they represent random hopping energies between nearest neighbors , expressed in units of energy @xmath9 , which is set to @xmath10 hereafter .",
    "interest in this model mainly comes from its unusual scaling properties at the band center , where soukoulis _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite have found critical state at the band center using green s function@xcite and transfer matrix method ( tmm ) @xcite .",
    "more recent tmm calculation by eilmes _ et .",
    "al_@xcite confirmed this result with a higher accuracy and showed the validity of one - parameter scaling not too close to the band center .",
    "nevertheless , miler and wang @xcite have found in their study of two models with chiral symmetry an apparent band of extended states near the band center , and it remained unclear what is the fate of these states in the infinite 2d system .",
    "another study @xcite yet showed that scaling exponent of the average participation number changed discontinuously near the band center , and the explicit dependence of this energy on the system size proposed by authors implied the existence of another diverging length scale in the problem .",
    "the last effect is rather subtle to calculate and led to a different participation number scaling exponent of the abd model at the band center in ref .",
    "@xcite compared to the one calculated here , as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ multifractality ] below .",
    "furthermore , brouwer _",
    "_ @xcite have calculated conductance distribution of quantum wires described by ( [ abd ] ) , and showed its non - universality and necessity to introduce an additional microscopic parameter .",
    "it is thus goal of this paper to present a detailed study of the scaling of localization length on the approach to the band center for an infinite 2d square lattice , and test the validity of one - parameter scaling , as well as to calculate the multifractal properties of the electron probability density on length scales smaller than the localization length .",
    "also a new analytical expression for the dos of the infinite two - dimensional system near the band center is proposed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : some general properties and exact results are presented in sec .",

    "suppose that the lattice is composed of two sublattices @xmath11 and @xmath12 with , respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 sites .",
    "the corresponding bond - disordered hamiltonian with chiral symmetry then has the form : @xmath15 it is easy to show that for every eigenstate @xmath16 with energy @xmath17 there is an eigenstate with energy @xmath18 with a wavefunction that has the opposite sign at each site of one of the two sublattices .",
    "if the total number of cites @xmath19 is odd and open boundaries condition is applied ( in order to keep the symmetry ) , then , since all eigenstates come in the opposite energy pairs , there will be exactly one state with eigenenergy @xmath20 .",
    "this can be furthermore generalized , and if @xmath21 , there exist exactly @xmath22 zero - energy eigenstates that have vanishing amplitude on the sublattice @xmath12 @xcite .    on the other hand , if @xmath23 , the electron has equal probability of occupying each of the two sublattices . to show this , ( [ bipartite ] )",
    "is represented in the basis where the first and second half of basis vectors are eigenstates of the position operator on sites of sublattice @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian is then represented as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a square matrix of hopping elements from one sublattice to the other .",
    "eigenstate @xmath26 satisfies : @xmath27 on the other hand , @xmath28 from ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) now follows that , for abd model , @xmath29 .    in this work only even @xmath2 finite size systems on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions",
    "are studied , because one of the main goals of this work is to understand the vicinity of the critical point of abd model on the infinite square lattice , which in turn has @xmath23 , while the limit @xmath30 for odd @xmath2 and open boundary conditions has @xmath31 .",
    "density of states ( dos ) is calculated by exact numerical diagonalization of finite size hamiltonians for various @xmath2 for many configurations of disorder , and binning of eigenenergies . obtained dos for each system size , @xmath32 , are normalized to @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath2 dependent parts of such obtained @xmath32 are then removed leaving @xmath2 independent dos @xmath33 , which is therefore expected to be correct in the @xmath30 limit .",
    "the removal of finite size dependency is based on an observation that dos converges quickly away from the band center with increasing of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , only a small number of eigenenergies ( up to 20 ) closest to the band center and corresponding dos histograms has been calculated for each @xmath2 .",
    "the calculated @xmath32 plotted on a single graph revealed that three bins closest to the band center are where the system size dependence sets in .",
    "their removal thus led to the dos @xmath33 of the infinite system .",
    "results for @xmath34 are given in fig .",
    "[ dos - fits ] , for system sizes @xmath35 and number of disordered configurations ranging , respectively , from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "they are fitted to a powerlaw divergence @xmath38 , as well as to the gade s result @xcite : @xmath39 all the calculations were done for several different number of bins , and the obtained values of fitting parameters were the same within error bars .",
    "the figure [ dos - fits ] shows that ( [ gade ] ) describes @xmath40 very accurately for @xmath41 , including the size - dependent part .",
    "the powerlaw , on the other hand , also describes the data accurately for same system sizes , but fails to describe the @xmath2-dependent part of @xmath40 . despite this ,",
    "neither of the two forms describe the whole @xmath33 accurately .",
    "instead , the expression found to best fit the obtained @xmath2-independent dos , given in fig .",
    "[ dos ] , is @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , represented by the full line in the same figure .",
    "the observed range in which ( [ new - dos ] ) is accurate is for all the energies studied smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "in the localized regime , an eigenstate is determined mainly by a local configuration of disorder where the wavefunction is localized , and two eigenstates close in energy are spatially far apart .",
    "level repulsion is therefore absent and the distribution of the nearest neighbor level spacings @xmath46 is poissonian @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mean level spacing .    in the delocalized phase ,",
    "on the other hand , eigenstates are extended throughout the system and level repulsion becomes significant for eigenstates with close energies . in the infinite 3d anderson site - disordered model ( asd ) , @xmath49 with uniformly distributed @xmath50 , distribution of level spacings becomes that of gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite , very accurately described by the wigner surmise @xmath51    in finite - size systems , localized states are on average at a distance @xmath2 rather than infinitely far apart .",
    "this leads to a repulsion between adjacent energy levels and non - universal distribution @xmath52 .",
    "shklovskii  _ et .",
    "@xcite have shown that @xmath52 of the 3d site - disordered anderson model exhibits linear dependence on @xmath53 characteristic for @xmath54 for small @xmath53 and exponential tail characteristic for @xmath55 for large @xmath53 .",
    "they were able , from the finite size scaling analysis of the tail , to accurately determine the critical point and exponent .",
    "in the infinite size limit , they have recovered not only @xmath55 in the insulating phase and @xmath54 in the conducting phase , but also a system size independent non - universal distribution at the critical point which was furthermore shown by braun _ et .",
    "al._@xcite to be dependent on boundary conditions .",
    "this method was also used for an accurate determination of localization length in two dimensional asd model @xcite , confirming the absence of delocalized states following the scenario of the insulating phase from ref .",
    "@xcite described above .    to see the effect of symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ bipartite ] ) on the distribution of level spacings ,",
    "let us for a moment consider @xmath5-th eigenenergy @xmath56 of the asd model . upon averaging over disorder , the @xmath56 will be distributed between @xmath57 and @xmath58 according to some distribution .",
    "some of the eigenenergies , for @xmath5 close to @xmath59 , will have @xmath60 .",
    "this is , however , forbidden for eigenstates of the abd model since every @xmath56 of ( [ bipartite ] ) is negative for @xmath61 and positive for @xmath62 .",
    "this means that eigenenergies of ( [ bipartite ] ) close to the band center are effectively pushed away from it due to the symmetry .",
    "if @xmath2 is much smaller than the localization length , states will be repelled among themselves due to their large spatial overlap .",
    "but the two states closest to the band center , being simply related to each another by the symmetry , will not repel at all , _",
    "i.e. _ the state closest to the band center is at the ( high energy ) end of the spectrum .",
    "thus , these two states are distributed around zero , where distributions of all other individual levels go to zero .    to explore consequences of this simple analysis , the level spacing distribution",
    "is calculated between each pair of adjacent levels separately .",
    "let us denote by @xmath63 level spacing distribution between @xmath5 and @xmath64 energy level after unfolding of spectrum @xcite , _",

    "figure  [ nn ] shows @xmath66 , for @xmath67 and , respectively @xmath68 configurations , and it can be seen that @xmath69 is distinctly different than @xmath70 .",
    "the same effect was also present for @xmath71 , while for @xmath72 and @xmath73 the number of disorder configurations was insufficient for accurate enough determination of individual @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this illustrates how the presence of chiral symmetry can profoundly influence spectral characteristics near the band center , despite the fact that dos of abd and asd models seem to have same shape for adequately chosen pairs of disorder parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 away from the band center ( and after rescaling of @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "eigenstate of an electron in the random potential fluctuates from site to site and it was proposed that the eigenstate at the mobility edge in disordered systems in general should have fractal structure@xcite , and shown that even localized states in one and two dimensions exhibit fractal character on length scales smaller than the localization length @xcite .",
    "inverse participation numbers @xmath76 ( ipn ) are particularly convenient quantities to describe scaling properties of probability distribution of the electron .",

    "this work is concerned mainly with the spectrum of generalized dimensions @xmath92 characterizing the spatial structure of eigenstates on the length scales smaller than the localization length , while the properties of @xmath101 will be discussed elsewhere . before detailed discussion of the results , an overview of the main results of this part of the paper is given .",
    "scaling of ipn at the band center is calculated first , and shown that scaling properties ( that is , whole spectrum of generalized dimensions @xmath92 ) changes discontinuously near the band center , at an energy @xmath102 for a range of @xmath2 studied .",
    "it is then shown that @xmath103 can be quite accurately identified with the half of the width of the energy range around band center within which two states occur on average in the ensemble of disordered systems .",

    "[ convergence - q ] .",
    "the error bars in the figure are taken to be the standard deviation of average value .",
    "the figure suggests the existence of an energy @xmath103 independent of @xmath82 ( and therefore defined by the whole multifractal measure ) such that decreasing @xmath85 below @xmath103 does not change @xmath106 significantly .",
    "decreasing of @xmath76 to a smaller extend , however , is still present for @xmath111 , and the main source of this is the mismatch between average and typical value of ipn at a given energy .",
    "thus , the effect should become smaller as the number of disorder configurations that are averaged over is increased , and @xmath112 up to the corresponding statistical error .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ convergence - q ] and [ convergence - l ] , where values of @xmath76 for @xmath113 are approximately constant within the error bars ( as indicated by the horizontal dashed lines ) , while for @xmath114 there is approximately linear dependence of @xmath76 on the bin size @xmath85 . in this sense figure  [ convergence - l ] suggests that @xmath103 exists for all the systems studied ( and can be shown to be independent of @xmath82 for each of them analogously as shown in fig .",

    "analogous analysis is carried out for energies away from the band center and @xmath84 determined accordingly , where it turns out that the convergence for these energies is slightly easier to establish and occurs at larger @xmath85 than at the band center .",

    "nontrivial feature connected with the existence of the new length scale @xmath121 is that scaling exponents @xmath122 are different for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "this is a generalization of findings from ref .",
    "@xcite , where a deviation from the powerlaw scaling of the average participation number for different @xmath85 at the band center appeared whenever @xmath85 exceeded @xmath102 in several models with chiral symmetry .",
    "it can be straightforwardly shown that same happens with scaling of @xmath125 .",
    "this suggests that a new scaling characteristic should be attributed to the two states closest to the band center , and that @xmath103 scales as @xmath126 , with a coefficient of proportionality close to one .",
    "this also implies that the corrections to the constant @xmath106 for @xmath111 are small .",
    "therefore , the length at which change of scaling occurs should be close to and depend on the energy proportionally to @xmath104 , while the change of scaling should be a narrow crossover , as opposed to much broader crossover from powerlaw to constant ipn that occurs at the termination of multifractal scaling ( [ tau_q ] ) for @xmath127 .",

    "this is due to the emergence of the new scaling for system sizes @xmath134 discussed above and present in fig .",
    "[ lnzqvslnl ] ; and ( iii ) for @xmath135 powerlaw is obeyed again ( @xmath133 ) , but with a different @xmath91 than for energies away from the band center .",

    "[ dq ] shows calculated @xmath92 for all energies except the three nonzero energies closest to the band center ( which can not give @xmath91 from the fitting procedure used here due to the change of scaling properties discussed above ) .",
    "in particular , the participation number grows with the number of sites @xmath136 as a powerlaw with exponents @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "this should be compared with the result for abd model of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath139 .",
    "it is easy to explain this discrepancy since the bin size @xmath140 used in ref .",
    "@xcite was , depending on the system size , roughly over an order of magnitude too large to detect the correct scaling behavior , and therefore @xmath141 was obtained instead .",
    "@xmath92 is calculated for only three negative values of @xmath82 , mainly because ipn for negative @xmath82 s are determined mostly by the parts of eigenstates with the smallest probability to find the electron , which in turn acquire the highest relative error during numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "difficulties in calculating @xmath92 in this regime even arose suspicion that multifractality might break down for negative @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to show that @xmath92 is defined for negative @xmath82 s as well as for positive ones .",
    "accuracy of all the calculations of ipn done in this section can be straightforwardly improved by increasing the number of configurations of disorder that was averaged over .",
    "this would lead to smaller error bars of all the quantities calculated , as well as to the wider range of @xmath82 s for which @xmath92 can be calculated .",
    "results of this section give the following picture of the scaling of ipn with system size : for any energy @xmath17 close enough to the band center , there exist two powerlaw scalings : one for @xmath142 described by the set of exponents @xmath143 , and another one for @xmath144 , described by a _",
    "different _ set of exponents @xmath145 , which leads to the two different spectra of generalized dimensions @xmath92 .",

    "[ xi(e ) ] , gives @xmath146 , with @xmath147    the meaning of this new length scale and corresponding exponent @xmath148 can be understood by assuming that the additional scaling of the two states is due to the finite size effect of `` smearing '' of the @xmath135 critical point of the infinite system , because exactly the two states closest to the band center become critical when @xmath30 .",
    "the critical energy then changes by @xmath149 which is , in a finite system of size @xmath2 ( in units of the lattice spacing ) , equal to @xmath150 . if furthermore @xmath151 in the infinite system , the shift @xmath152 of the critical energy in the system of size @xmath2 is @xmath153 , from the general theory of the finite size scaling @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath148 equals @xmath154 , the critical exponent of the correlation length of the infinite two - dimensional system .",
    "it should be noticed that the finite size scaling applied here is somewhat different than usual , where @xmath155 @xcite . here , @xmath156 and @xmath157 , where both energies are expressed in units of @xmath9 , as discussed in the introduction .",

    "the scaling analysis consists of assuming that the change of the largest ile , @xmath159 , due to rescaling @xmath160 can be compensated by an appropriate change of energy , after which @xmath161 will remain the same , which implies that @xcite @xmath162 figure  [ ile ] shows the calculated @xmath159 for several energies @xmath17 close to the band center and for various strips up to @xmath163 sites wide .",

    "@xcite . on the other hand , at any given energy , every pair of ile becomes more repelling with increasing of @xmath25 .",
    "such increased number of ile thus diminishes the attractive effect of the symmetry , and , depending on the relative strengths of the two effects , there are two regimes : ( i ) for smaller @xmath25 , the largest ile increases approximately linearly with @xmath25 , and , since the slope of the rise changes with energy , fss can not be done ; ( ii ) for sufficiently large @xmath25 , on the other hand , the repulsion among ile due to disorder dominates and fss is possible .",
    "the one - parameter universal function @xmath171 , obtained for system sizes @xmath172 for energies @xmath173 , and for system sizes @xmath174 for energies @xmath175 , is presented in fig .",
    "[ universal ] . the obtained localization length @xmath176 , in units of the localization length of the smallest energy studied ( @xmath177 ) ,",
    "is shown in the inset of the same figure .",
    "calculated @xmath178 is fitted to the powerlaw for energies @xmath179 , and the result suggests powerlaw diverging localization length at the band center , with the exponent @xmath180 in agreement with the result ( [ nu ] ) of sec .",
    "[ multifractality ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors also calculated one - parameter scaling curves for energies further away from the band center than in this work and found that there is a universal curve for a large set of abd systems with different @xmath74 that they studied .",
    "the obtained one - parameter function suggested that @xmath181 either grows indefinitely when @xmath105 , which is similar to the two dimensional asd model @xcite or becomes constant . if this result were correct , however , for the smaller energies than studied there , it would imply that localization length at the band center either diverges logarithmically , as in the 2d asd model , or that it has a finite limiting value .",
    "we see therefore that , although correct in the energy range studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the picture of a single scaling curve for different @xmath74 from the same work should break down for smaller energies , since the powerlaw diverging @xmath87 requires that @xmath182 goes to zero when @xmath105 , and separate one - parameter scaling curves exist for each @xmath74 .",
    "some additional analysis of the results can be done by introducing @xmath183 , defined as the maximal @xmath159 for a given strip width @xmath25 .",
    "importance of this quantity comes from the fact that points where @xmath161 reaches its maximum for various energies can not be described by fss , and , at the same time , @xmath184 limits by its definition possible values that @xmath181 ( obtained from the fss ) can have .",
    "the main observation is that @xmath184 seems to grow slower than linearly in fig .",
    "linear ( or faster ) growth would imply existence of an additional energy scale below which fss would break down for all large @xmath25 and @xmath159 would grow linearly and indefinitely with @xmath25 in the same figure , implying the existence of a whole band of extended states where one - parameter scaling would not hold .",
    "slower than linear growth of @xmath184 seen , therefore , furthermore suggests the existence of a single critical point at the band center of the system on an infinite square lattice .",
    "in conclusions , main results of this work are summarized .",
    "density of states of finite size systems are calculated and shown the validity of gade s expression ( [ gade ] ) .",
    "the calculated part of the dos for the system on an infinite square lattice , however , suggests a different dependence on energy near the band center , @xmath185 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "other calculated quantities share in common a qualitative feature of a discontinuous change near or at the band center .",
    "the nearest neighbor level spacing distributions , for instance , between the state closest to the band center and the next one seem to be distinctly different than the level spacing distributions between other neighboring states .",
    "this was argued to be connected to the chiral symmetry of the model , which places the two states closest to @xmath135 at the ( high energy ) end of the spectrum .",
    "these two states are furthermore found to play a crucial role in explaining the discontinuous change of the scaling properties of ipn near the band center .",
    "extrapolation to the limit of infinite square lattice then led to the two different spectra of generalized dimensions @xmath92  one for @xmath186 ( present at the length scales smaller than the localization length ) , and another one for @xmath135 ( present at all length scales ) .",
    "finite size scaling associated with the effects that finite @xmath2 has on the critical band center states of the infinite system led to the value @xmath187 of the critical exponent of the localization length .",
    "additional scaling analysis of ile of transfer matrices of long quasi-1d systems gave the value @xmath188 .",
    "this suggests that there is only one critical state at the band center with all other states localized in the system on the infinite square lattice , in agreement with findings of ref .",
    "one parameter universal function @xmath181 is calculated and another discontinuity found , since @xmath189 .",
