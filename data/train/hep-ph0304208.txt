    "the analysis presented in this paper has not pursued the interesting possibility of mixing between gluonium and quark mesons @xcite , although in principle any hadronic state that overlaps with the pseudoscalar gluonium interpolating field would be probed by the correlator ( [ corr_fn ] ) which underlies our entire analysis .",
    "this possibility of other resonances coupled to the pseudoscalar gluonic current was explored through an extension of the section [ gauss_results_sec ] analysis to two narrow resonances tends to lead to nearly - degenerate states near @xmath58 , suggesting that the @xmath58 state is more strongly coupled to the pseudoscalar gluonic operator than other pseudoscalar states such as the @xmath116 .",
    "this result is not unexpected , since the coupling of the @xmath58 state @xmath117 to the pseudoscalar gluonic current extracted from the peak value of @xmath118 with the optimized value of @xmath57 is @xmath119 by comparison , the couplings of @xmath120 to the pseudoscalar gluonic operators are @xcite @xmath121 and hence the relative strength of the @xmath122 compared with @xmath117 obtained from the ratios of the squares of ( [ p_coupling ] ) and ( [ eta_coup ] ) is approximately 0.2% , and the relative strength of the @xmath123 is approximately 0.02% .",
    "this result is upheld by a fit of the relative strength of the @xmath116 and a gaussian resonance to the normalized gsr results in a relative strength of less than 1% .",
    "thus the @xmath124 state resulting from our analysis appears to be dominantly - coupled to the pseudoscalar gluonic operators .",
