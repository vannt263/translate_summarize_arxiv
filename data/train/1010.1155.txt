    "weak measurements , which were introduced by aharonov , albert and vaidman ( aav ) in 1988 @xcite and implemented successfully in the experiments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , have challenged the view that the value of an observable in quantum mechanics has physical reality only if it is actually measured .",
    "the idea of weak measurement is very useful as it assists us in understanding many counterintuitive quantum phenomena , resolving paradoxes that arise in quantum mechanics such as hardy s paradoxes @xcite , and addressing questions of fundamental importance @xcite .",
    "it was realized recently that weak measurements are also very useful for high - precision measurements , they are used by hosten et al .",
    "@xcite to observe a tiny spin hall effect in light ( see a nice perspective in @xcite ) , and by dixon et al .",
    "@xcite to detect very small transverse beam deflections .",
    "a weak - measurement scheme was also recently proposed by brunner et al .",
    "@xcite to measure small longitudinal phase shifts .",
    "weak measurement of an observable @xmath0 typically includes pre - selection of an initial state for the system , weak interaction between the system and a measuring device , and post - selection of a final state for the system .",
    "the interaction , described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 , associates a certain property of the system observable @xmath0 to the shift of a certain pointer position @xmath2 of the measuring device . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are a pair of conjugate variables of the device , satisfying @xmath4=i$ ] ( with @xmath5 throughout this article ) .",
    "@xmath6 is a real function with @xmath7 , and it is frequently given in the simple form @xmath8 .",
    "for an ideal measurement , the initial state of the device is well localized in the @xmath2 space so the pointer position @xmath2 will be shifted by an amount determined by one of the eigenvalues of @xmath0 with a certain probability .",
    "weak measurement takes the opposite approach , we either choose an initial pointer state that is spread out greatly over the @xmath2 space ( with a small standard deviation @xmath9 in the p space ) or choose a very small @xmath10 , such that @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the pre - selected state and @xmath13 is the post - selected state of the system according to aav s original formalism .",
    "a subsequent ideal projection measurement is preformed , and we only keep the subset of data that corresponds to the post - selection .",
    "conditional on the pre- and post - selection , the average shifts of @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the measuring device in a weak measurement are given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the weak value defined by @xmath16 here and in the following , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) denotes the expectation value ( variance ) of an observable @xmath19 of the device in its initial state @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) with a prime denotes the corresponding value in the final state of the device after the interaction and post - selection . @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the real part and imaginary part of a complex number @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the high - precision experiments via weak measurement have been performed with a post - selected state nearly orthogonal to the pre - selected state , as the weak value @xmath15 could become very large when the pre- and post - selected states ( pps ) are close to being orthogonal .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that when the pps are too close to being orthogonal , condition ( [ aavcondition ] ) is no longer satisfied and the results in ( [ deltaq ] ) and ( [ deltap ] ) start to fail",
    ". there are some specific discussions about the phenomena in this regime @xcite , but much needs to be understood and a complete treatment is lacking .    in this article",
    "we shall study weak measurements in the most general case , provide theoretical results to cover the regime that is potentially relevant in certain high - precision measurements .",
    "our study also reveals two surprising results .",
    "first , for a fixed interaction strength , there may exist a maximum measurement outcome and an optimum overlap for the pps to achieve it .",
    "second , even when the pps are exactly orthogonal , there exist interesting quantities that play a role similar to that of the weak values .",
    "the rest of the article is arranged as follows .",
    "we first introduce the weak - interaction condition and then set up a framework for discussing weak measurements in the most general case .",
    "next , we derive detailed results for non - orthogonal weak measurements and then for orthogonal weak measurements .",
    "frequently the system observable @xmath0 acts on a finite - dimensional hilbert space ; it is convenient to redefine @xmath0 and @xmath10 such that @xmath0 becomes a dimensionless operator with a unit norm ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) , and @xmath27 . throughout this article , we shall follow this convention .",
    "it should be pointed out that aav s original condition ( [ aavcondition ] ) is too strict as it may limit further applications in high - resolution experiments for signal amplification , when the pre- and post - selected states are chosen to be nearly orthogonal . in order to derive a formula for the regime beyond ( [ aavcondition ] ) , we shall refer to the condition @xmath28 as _ the weak - interaction condition_. this condition has no dependence on the arbitrary choices of the pre- and post - selected states , and we shall see later that it actually means that the interaction between the system and the measuring device is so weak that the state of the system stays almost unchanged during the interaction ( however , the change of the device state is not restricted ) . for comparison , we refer to ( [ aavcondition ] ) as _ the original weak measurement condition_. in the following we shall largely focus on the regime where the original weak measurement condition ( [ aavcondition ] ) is violated while the weak - interaction condition ( [ wm . ] ) is still satisfied ; this is the regime where the pps are nearly or exactly orthogonal .",
    "we shall first derive a general formalism with no restriction on the pps .",
    "now we set the stage for the general case .",
    "we assume that the initial state ( pre - selection ) of the system is a general mixed state @xmath29 ( instead of the pure state @xmath30 ) , and the initial state of the measuring device is also a general mixed state @xmath31 . instead of a pure state @xmath32 , we assume the post - selection is a general projection @xmath33 onto a subspace . the weak interaction ( defined by the hamiltonian @xmath1 ) between the pre - selection and post - selection may not satisfy the original weak measurement condition ( [ aavcondition ] ) , but we assume it satisfies our weak - interaction condition ( [ wm . ] ) . in the rest of this article",
    ", we shall derive the average shifts of the pointer position and momentum conditional on the general pps in the above general case , and therefore understand what is really measured in such a generalized weak measurement scenario .",
    "the weak value of an observable @xmath0 can be naturally extended for the general pre - selected state @xmath29 and the general post - selection @xmath33 as @xcite @xmath34 which reduces to aav s original definition of weak values ( [ weak value ] ) when the pps are pure states . for the convenience of discussion",
    ", we also define the following notations @xmath35 which can be viewed as generalized high - order weak values when @xmath36 .",
    "one easily has @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "when the pps are pure states , it is obvious that @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .    the time - evolution operator corresponding to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 , where the observable @xmath0 we like to measure weakly is dimensionless and has unit norm , since we already redefined @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "the overall state after the interaction is given by @xmath45 here @xmath46 defines the adjoint action of @xmath47 on @xmath48 as @xmath49 $ ] , and similarly @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "we can expand @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the binomial coefficient .",
    "the state of the system after the interaction is given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath56 , or more generally @xmath57{\\langle p^n\\rangle}\\ , n\\in \\mathbb{n}\\ } \\ll 1 \\quad\\ ] ] the state of the system will stay almost unchanged , rather than collapsing after the interaction .",
    "this is the reason we call @xmath56 the weak - interaction condition .",
    "the subsequent post - selection is generally represented by a projection @xmath58 onto a subspace of the system s hilbert space .",
    "the density matrix of the device after the post - selection is given by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) denotes the trace over the system ( whole ) hilbert space . from ( [ overallstateafterwi ] ) , we have @xmath62 where the normalization factor @xmath63 gives the success probability of post - selection @xmath64 the average shift of a pointer observable @xmath19 is given by @xmath65",
    ". we shall derive the average shifts of the pointer position and momentum for two different cases : the non - orthogonal weak measurement and the orthogonal weak measurement .",
    "now we consider the case when the weak - interaction condition ( [ wm . ] ) is satisfied and @xmath66 .",
    "a weak measurement in this regime will be referred to as _ a non - orthogonal weak measurement_. the pps we consider here do not have to be pure states . however , even if the pps are pure states , the non - orthogonal weak measurement scenario considered here extends aav s original weak measurement .",
    "the non - orthogonal weak measurement includes not only aav s original weak measurement as a special case , but also the case when the pps are nearly ( but not yet ) orthogonal , i.e. , the case when the original weak measurement condition ( [ aavcondition ] ) is usually violated due to small overlap : @xmath67 .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath68 with @xmath69 where @xmath70 is defined according to ( [ generalizedwv ] ) . for pure pps , @xmath71 , and thus @xmath72 .",

    ", we further assume that the initial pointer state @xmath31 satisfies @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( they are clearly satisfied by a pure initial pointer state that is an even wave function )",
    ". therefore we have @xmath81    when @xmath82 ( but @xmath83 ) , the average shifts of @xmath2 and @xmath3 may increase first , and then decrease rapidly when @xmath84 becomes comparable to @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath10 and @xmath86 , there may exist a maximum shift of a pointer quantity and an optimal overlap @xmath87 to achieve the maximum shift .",
    "we can not increase the shift of the pointer quantity arbitrarily by varying the overlap between the pre- and post - selected states .",
    "this is a very surprising result , and we shall discuss it below in more detail for the stern - gerlach experiment setup by aav .",
    "spin-1/2 particles with a pre - selected spin pointed in the direction * @xmath88 * ( which is on the xz plane ) travel along the y axis through an inhomogeneous ( in the z direction ) weak magnetic field , and then post - selected by a strong inhomogeneous magnetic field in the @xmath89 direction ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the weak interaction can be written as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 depends on the weak magnetic field .",
    "with the substitution @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 in ( [ outcomes31 ] ) , the average shift of the z component of the particle momentum @xmath95 conditional on pre- and post - selection is obtained directly , which in turn gives the measured value of the spin component @xmath96 : @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the angle between * @xmath88 * and @xmath89 , @xmath99 denotes the interaction strength , and @xmath100 denotes the standard deviation of @xmath101 in the initial ( pre - selected ) state , which is related to the width @xmath102 for a gaussian beam by @xmath103 . the weak - interaction condition ( [ wm . ] ) requires @xmath104 .",
    "the predicted weak measurement outcome of @xmath96 as a function of @xmath98 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ modify ] for different values of @xmath105 .",
    "if we let @xmath106 , it follows that @xmath107 is very small when the pps are close to being orthogonal .",
    "aav s original weak measurement condition ( [ aavcondition ] ) requires @xmath108 , which is quickly violated as @xmath109 .",
    "( [ sg ] ) reduces to @xmath110 with @xmath109 .",
    "one can also see that for a fixed value of @xmath105 , the maximum outcome is approximately ( of the order of ) @xmath111 , which is achieved when @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , for a fixed @xmath105 , the measured value of the spin component may not be increased arbitrarily by decreasing the overlap between the pps .",
    "the aav s original formula corresponds to the limiting case @xmath113 .     under different interaction strength @xmath105.,width=245 ]    when the pps are pure states and the overlap @xmath114 is not small ( compared with @xmath115 ) so the original weak measurement condition ( [ aavcondition ] ) is satisfied , we have @xmath116 ; therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ outcomes31 ] ) and ( [ outcomes32 ] ) directly reduce to eqs .",
    "( [ deltaq ] ) and ( [ deltap ] ) .",
    "aav s original weak measurement is indeed a special case of the general scenario considered here .",
    "now we consider another limiting case of our non - orthogonal weak measurement , i.e. , the case when the pre - selection and the post - selection are orthogonal [ i.e. , @xmath117 while the weak - interaction condition eq . is still satisfied . a weak measurement in this scenario shall be referred to as _ orthogonal weak measurement_. the original weak measurement formalism totally fails ( even for pure pps ) , and the weak values are even not defined .    due to the weak interaction between the device and the system , the system state @xmath118 after the interaction could differ slightly from the pre - selected state @xmath29 ; therefore , the follow - up post - selection could have a nonzero success probability in general .",
    "however , when either the pre - selected state @xmath29 or the post - selection @xmath33 commutes with the observable @xmath0 , the success probability for post - selection is strictly zero .",
    "therefore , in the following discussion of orthogonal weak measurements , we assume that neither @xmath29 nor @xmath33 commutes with @xmath0 .    since for the orthogonal case @xmath119 , one immediately has @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , from ( [ rhodeviceafter ] ) , one has @xmath121 where @xmath122    without loss of generality , we assume that the @xmath123 term in ( [ rhodeviceafterorthogonal ] ) does not vanish , namely , @xmath124 ( similar discussion follows directly if the @xmath125 term is the lowest - order term ) .",

    "we assume that the pps are pure states , i.e. , @xmath129 and @xmath130 ; and we further assume that the initial wave function of the device is _ even _ ( or @xmath131 ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath132 where @xmath133 when the pps are pure states . here , @xmath134 is the expectation value of @xmath19 with respect to the initial state .",
    "when the initial pointer state is a gaussian , the results become even simpler @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the variances of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the final pointer state after the post - selection .",
    "the final probability distribution function has two peaks at @xmath138 in the @xmath3 space , and at @xmath139 in the @xmath2 space ( see fig .  [ distribution ] ) .",
    "the variances of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are generally enlarged because the wave function spreads out with double peaks after the orthogonal weak measurement .",
