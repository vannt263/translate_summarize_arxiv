    "one of the most remarkable predictions of strong - field gravity is the existence of a region outside a black - hole horizon , in which there are no closed photon orbits .",
    "all photons that venture into this region eventually cross the horizon and are removed from the observable universe .",
    "the net result is a shadow imprinted by every black hole on the emission that originates in its vicinity ( bardeen 1973 ; luminet 1979 ) .",
    "the size of the shadow of a black hole is determined by the radius of the photon orbit in its spacetime .",
    "the radius of the photon orbit changes significantly with black - hole spin , from @xmath7 for a non - spinning black hole to @xmath8 for a maximally spinning one in boyer - lindquist coordinates and for a prograde photon orbit ( bardeen et al .",
    "1972 ; here @xmath1 is the mass of the black hole ) , however , because of gravitational lensing , the size and shape of the black - hole shadow observed at infinity has a very weak dependence on the black - hole spin or the orientation of the observer .",
    "its radius changes from @xmath9 for a non - spinning black hole ( independent of orientation ) to @xmath10 for a maximally spinning one viewed pole on ( see , e.g. , de vries 2000 ; takahashi 2004 ; bozza et al .  2006 ; johannsen & psaltis 2010 ; chan et al .",
    "2013 ) . as a result , for a black hole of known mass and distance , identifying the presence of the shadow and confirming that its size is in the narrow range @xmath11 constitutes a null hypothesis test of the kerr metric",
    "indeed , for other plausible black - hole or naked - singularity metrics the size of the shadow has been shown to be significantly different ( for different modifications to the kerr metric see , e.g. , bambi & freese 2009 ; johannsen & psaltis 2010 ; bambi & yoshida 2010 ; amarilla & eiroa 2013 ) .",

    "( 2014 ) , blurring due to scattering takes place in the ensemble average regime ( see narayan & goodman 1989 ; goodman & narayan 1989 ) . as a result , the blurring effects on the image can be formally corrected for , if the scattering kernel at 1.3  mm is known _ a priori_. after collecting all the published measurements of the scattered broadened image of sgr  a@xmath3 , we find that different aspects of the scattering ellipse at longer wavelengths can be inferred with a fractional accuracy in the range @xmath15% .",
    "we argue that extrapolating these results down to the 1.3  mm wavelength of the eht observations requires a more accurate measurement of the long - wavelength scattering kernel as well as a better understanding of the wavelength dependence of its anisotropy .",
    "finally , in  4 we investigate model independent methods to measure the shape and size of the black - hole shadow from interferometric observations .",
    "we explore an edge detection algorithm based on the gradient of the image brightness that allows us to extract the shape of the shadow from the image and a pattern matching algorithm based on the hough / radon transform to measure the shadow properties .",
    "we apply these algorithms to our recent ray tracing calculation of grmhd simulations and find that , in principle , the shape and size of the black - hole shadow can be measured to a @xmath16% accuracy .",
    "general relativity predicts the size of a black - hole shadow in units of the gravitational radius @xmath8 , which we will denote hereafter simply as @xmath1 .",
    "however , in order to compare the theoretical predictions to the observations , we need a prior knowledge of the ratio @xmath13 of the mass of the black hole to its distance from earth .",
    "this ratio sets the angular size of one gravitational radius on the sky of an observer .",
    "the mass of sgr  a@xmath3  and its distance from the earth can be inferred by fitting keplerian orbits to optical / ir observations of stars in the vicinity of the black hole ( see , e.g. , ghez et al .  2008 ; gillessen et al .  2009a , 2009b ) .",
    "these measurement are typically highly correlated .",
    "astrometric observations of the stellar positions typically constrain the ratio @xmath17 , whereas spectral measurements of radial velocities constrain the ratio @xmath13 . when multiple such data sets are combined , the correlated errors between mass and distance stretch along the curve @xmath18 .",
    "in general , each study of the stellar orbits around sgr  a@xmath3  leads to the two - dimensional posterior likelihood @xmath19 . for our purposes",
    ", we are only interested in the marginalized posterior likelihood over the ratio @xmath20 .",
    "if we set @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 then we conclude that @xmath24 using the two - dimensional posterior likelihood @xmath25 over the distance and the mass of the black hole from studies of stellar orbits , we can employ this equation to calculate the posterior likelihood over the angular size of one gravitational radius for sgr  a@xmath3 .    figure  [ fig : angdiam ] shows the improvement in the inference of this angular size , as increasingly more data are incorporated for the stellar orbits .",
    "when only the astrometric orbits of the inner stellar cluster are considered ( i.e. , using the two - dimensional posterior likelihoods @xmath25 shown in figure  11 of ghez et al .  2008 ) , the uncertainty in the angular size of sgr  a@xmath3  is at the 10% level . when radial velocity data for the s2 star are also incorporated ( i.e. , using the equivalent of figure  15 of gillessen et al .",
    "2009b but including the data for the s2 orbit , as discussed in gillessen et al .",
    "2009a ) , the angular size of one gravitational radius for sgr  a@xmath3  becomes 5.12@xmath260.29  @xmath27arcsec .",
    "finally , when the data for the s0 - 38 orbit are also included ( boehle et al .",
    "2015 ) , then the angular size of one gravitational radius becomres equal to 5.09@xmath260.17  @xmath27arcsec .",
    "this @xmath28% uncertainty in the last measurement is comparable to the @xmath29% uncertainty in the predicted size of the black - hole shadow given that we currently do not have a prior knowledge of the spin of the black hole or of the orientation of its spin axis with respect to the earth .",
    "a number of different observations in the near future will reduce significantly the uncertainties in the above measurements .",
    "next generation adaptive optics systems operating in 30-m class telescopes may discover stars with orbits that are closer to the black hole than the currently known s stars and that display different relativistic effects .",
    "the improved accuracy of the astrometric measurements and the detection of relativistic precession will lead to uncertainties in the inferred mass of sgr  a@xmath3  and its distance that are as small as 0.1% ( weinberg et al .  2005 ) . at the same time",
    ", the detection of even a single radio pulsar in a sub - year orbit around sgr  a@xmath3  will lead to an unprecedentent fractional accuracy in the measurement of the black - hole mass and distance that may be as low as @xmath30 ( liu et al .",
    "2012 ; see also pfahl & loeb 2004 ; psaltis et al .",
    "the long - wavelength images of sgr  a@xmath3  are much larger than expected for the emission from the accretion flow and their size depends on wavelength in a manner that is consistent with their being scatter - broadened by the interstellar medium ( see figure  [ fig : images ] , bower et al .",
    "2006 , and references below ) . at the 1.3  mm wavelength of the eht observations , the size of the scattering kernel",
    "is expected to be of the order of 22  @xmath27arcsec , which is approximately one fourth of the size of the black - hole shadow .",
    "the effect of scattering is to smooth the underlying image structure at scales smaller than the size of the kernel , potentially masking and blurring the edges of the shadow .",
    "fish et al .",
    "( 2014 ) argued that scatter broadening towards sgr  a@xmath3  takes place in the ensemble average regime ( narayan & goodman 1989 ; goodman & narayan 1989 ) and is , therefore , deterministic .",
    "recent observations of refractive substructure at larger wavelengths ( gwinn et al .",
    "2014 ) , however , clearly suggest that the averaging over the scattering ensemble is incomplete and a subsequent theoretical study ( johnson & gwinn 2015 ) demonstrated that this substructure is not quenched by the presence of an extended source .",
    "nevertheless , if data from many epochs and hence from many realizations of the scattering ensemble are added , the effect of scatter broadening can be considered as taking place in the ensemble average regime .",
    "formally speaking , scatter broadening in this regime causes the amplitudes of the observed interferometric visibilities to be reduced by a real factor that is equal to the fourier transform of the scattering kernel .",
    "if we have good prior knowledge of the scattering kernel , we can then easily correct for the blurring effects of scattering . fish et al .",
    "( 2014 ) explored different avenues of deblurring ( direct or with wiener filters ) and demonstrated their efficiency with mock eht data .",
    "they also considered the formal uncertainties in the measurement of the scattering kernel properties ( as reported by bower et al .",
    "2006 ) and their effect on the results of the deblurring algorithms .    in this section ,",
    "we explore the systematic uncertainties in the measurements of the properties of the scattering kernel .",
    "this is important for a number of reasons , which we discuss below .",
    "measurements of the scattering kernel properties need to be done at relatively long wavelengths , for which the size of the source is much smaller than the size of the kernel .",
    "recent observations found evidence for milliarcsec substructure in the images of sgr  a@xmath3  at wavelengths as large as 1.3  cm ( gwinn et al .",
    "this is corroborated by the measured deviation of the wavelength dependence of the scattering kernel from the theoretical expected scaling of @xmath31 at comparable wavelengths , as we show in figure  [ fig : normalized ] below ( see also falcke & markoff  2012 ) . as a result , the properties of the scattering kernel need to be measured at wavelengths as large as @xmath32  cm and then extrapolated down to the 1.3  mm wavelength of the eht .",
    "this extrapolation by two orders of magnitude runs the risk of amplifying even minor systematic errors that are unaccounted for .",
    "the large dynamical range of the extrapolation becomes even more important when we consider the fact that the measured scattering kernel towards sgr  a@xmath3  is highly anisotropic .",
    "it is often modeled in terms of an ellipse , with a 2:1 axis ratio and a major axis that is oriented primarily along the e - w axis on the sky ( see  3.1 below ) .",
    "the origin of the anisotropy is widely believed to be related to large scale magnetic fields in the turbulent interstellar medium , the statistical properties of which determine both the axis ratio of the scattering ellipse and its orientation ( see , e.g. , chandran & backer 2002 ) .",
    "these two quantities may not remain constant , as is currently assumed , when the wavelength changes by over two orders of magnitude .",
    "a theoretical investigation of this issue is necessary to make progress but is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "our goal in this section is to explore the wavelength dependence of the properties of the scattering kernel towards sgr  a@xmath3  and infer the level of existing systematic differences between the various measurements across the mm - to - cm spectrum .",
    "tables  [ tab : var]-[tab : shen ] summarize the published measurements of the image size of sgr  a@xmath3  in the mm - to - cm range , for which the data quality was sufficient to detect an elliptical ( as opposed to a circular ) image .",
    "we only consider measurements at wavelengths larger than 0.7  mm , as source structure is clearly seen at 1.3 and 3  mm ( doeleman et al .  200 ; bower et al .",
    "2014 ) . for most wavelengths ,",
    "there has been only one measurement reported , which is what we include . for some wavelengths ,",
    "more than one measurements have been carried out ; in these cases , as we explain below , we chose the result of the most recent publication ( when the same data were analyzed more than once ) or the one with the smallest reported uncertainties ( which is often the most recent , as well ) .",

    "however , the fractional uncertainties in the minor axis size and in the position angle are @xmath84% and @xmath85% , respectively .",
    "the primary reason for these large uncertainties is the fact that most measurements were done with interferometric arrays that have a good coverage along the e - w orientation but a poor coverage perpendicular to it .",
    "additional observations with better coverage in the @xmath86 orientation and a theoretical understanding of the wavelength dependence of the axis ratio and the position angle of the scattering ellipse will be crucial in reducing the level of these systematic uncertainties .",
    "in its original conception , the black - hole shadow was calculated under the assumption of back illumination of a black hole by a bundle of photons in parallel trajectories that originated in the far infinity ( bardeen 1973 ) . in this case , the trajectories of photons that enter inside the photon radius are gravitationally bent towards the black - hole horizon and never reach the distant observer .    in the realistic case of a mm image of an accreting black hole , such as sgr  a@xmath3 ,",
    "the situation is , of course , different , because the majority of photons originate very close to the location of the photon orbit , in all directions .",
    "nevertheless , if the emission is optically thin , as it is expected to be at mm wavelengths for sgr  a@xmath3 , simulations have repeatedly shown that a shadow will be imprinted on the image of the accretion flow , ( see , e.g. , jaroszynski & kurpiewski 1997 ; falcke et al .",

    "the brightness of the image is suppressed by at least an order of magnitude , while the outline of the shadow is surrounded by a bright photon ring ( see figure  [ fig : contrast ] ) .    in principle , comparing a detailed model for the emission properties of the accretion flow around sgr  a@xmath3  to eht observations will lead to a measurement of the size and shape of the shadow imprinted by the black hole . however , predicting the details of the brightness profile of the image of the accretion flow that surrounds the black - hole shadow beyond its gross properties is not feasible for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is related to our current understanding of accretion physics . in all available analytical and numerical models of the sgr  a@xmath3  emission ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the electrons are incorporated in a highly simplified and _ ad hoc _ fashion ( see , e.g. , all the references cited above ) .",
    "quantities such as the energy distribution of electrons and the ratio of electron to ion temperatures are often taken to be constant in time and across different regions of the accretion flow , even though neither of the two assumptions are expected to be correct in detail .",
    "the second reason is related to the expected and observed variability of the emission from sgr  a@xmath3 .",
    "the inner accretion flow is by its nature highly turbulent and variable . as a result ,",
    "even if we had a highly predictive model for the thermodynamic properties of the plasma , it would still be extremely unlikely that any realization of the model would match the details of any particular snapshot of the observations ( chan et al .",
    "this would be equivalent to having a model of cloud formation in the earth s atmosphere and trying to fit cloud shapes to pictures of the sky .",
    "because of these two reasons , inferring the properties of the black - hole shadow as a by - product of fitting accretion flow images to the eht observations is not expected to be accurate .",
    "any naive posterior likelihood analysis will direct the model parameters towards minimizing the variance between the observations and the incomplete models in the high intensity regions of the image and not towards accurately reproducing the shape and size of the black - hole shadow .",
    "our goal here is to study null - hypothesis tests of modified gravity with eht observations of the black - hole shadow around sgr  a@xmath3 . in order to achieve this",
    ", we need a procedure to analyze the eht data that focuses on measuring directly the properties of the shadow in a manner that is not seriously affected by our inability to predict the brightness profile of the rest of the image .",
    "indeed , the shape and size of the black - hole shadow depend only on the properties of the spacetime and can be predicted to very high accuracy without being affected by the complexities of modeling the accretion flow .",
    "( this is true unless the shadow is completely obscurred by intervening plasma or there is no background emission in the accretion flow on which the shadow can be cast . )",
    "as discussed in detail below , the expected sharpness of the shadow allows us to devise a procedure to measure accurately the properties of the shadow is based on edge - detection schemes in image processing .",
    "the sharpness of the shadow , i.e. , the length scale over which the image brightness declines , depends primarily on the profile of photon emission within the flow and the velocity field . in order to explore realistic profiles of the emission across the black - hole shadow ,",
    "we use the results of recent ray - tracing calculations on grmhd simulations reported in chan et al .",
    "( 2015a ) .",

    "2015a for the choice of parameters ) .",
    "as figure  [ fig : contrast ] shows , the rim of the shadow is not sharp at the equatorial plane of the accretion flow  where there is significant emission originating in the front side of the black hole",
    " and towards the doppler boosted part of the emission .",
    "on the other hand , the rim is significantly sharper away from the equatorial plane and towards the doppler deboosted part of the emission , with the brightness of the image dropping from its maximum to its minimum value over a displacement of @xmath88  m , producing a well defined edge .",
    "there exist several techniques in image processing for detecting sharp features ( edges ) in a model - independent fashion . of these ,",
    "two algorithms are particularly well suited for images obtained with interferometers : gradient methods ( e.g. , marr & hildreth 1980 ; canny 1983 ) and phase congruency methods ( e.g. , kovesi 1999 ) .",

    ", the image of the magnitude of the gradient will have local maxima at the locations of the steepest gradients , which , in the case of the expected eht images , will coincide with the outline of the back hole shadow .",

    ", the construction of a gradient image requires special care since the gradient operator in the @xmath12 plane will amplify the measurement errors in the largest baselines .",
    "this can be mitigated by designing an optimal high - frequency filter that will suppress the noise without unnecessarily sacrificing resolution .",

    ", fainter and larger rim appears at the outer edge of the image .    having obtained a gradient image in which the rim of the black - hole shadow appears as the most discernible feature , we can now employ a pattern matching algorithm in order to determine the shape and size of the shadow .",
    "we will explore here the hough transform ( duda & hard 1972 ) and , in particular , we will follow the spirit of the closely connected radon transform that allows for a probabilistic description of its results .",
    "this is crucial for our purposes because not only do we want an algorithm to measure the properties of the black - hole shadow but we also want to assess the statistical significance of the results .",
    "as discussed earlier , in general relativity , the outline of the black - hole shadow depends on only two parameters : the black - hole spin and the inclination of the observer . in principle",
    ", we can extract both these parameters using the pattern matching technique outlined below . in practice",
    ", however , the shape and size of the shadow has a very weak dependence on these parameters ( @xmath29% , see , e.g. , takahashi 2004 ; bozza et al .",
    "2006 ; johannsen 2013 ) .",
    "moreover , the uncertainties in the prior knowledge of the astrophysical complexities discussed in the previous section are comparable to or larger than the range of shadow sizes predicted for the kerr metric . as a result",

    "this is why we consider this approach a general relativistic null hypothesis test .",

    "future observations with next generation adaptive optics in 30-m class telescopes will reduce this uncertainty to less than one part in a thousand ( weinberg et al .",
    "2005 ) , effectively removing it from the error budget of the test .",
    "second , the blurring effects of scattering in the turbulent interstellar medium need to be removed in order for the sharp black - hole shadow to be easily distinguishable from the surrounding emission .",
