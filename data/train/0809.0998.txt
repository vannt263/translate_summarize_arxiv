    "in fact , the latter are essentially conceived as newtonian , hence based on a classical ( euclidean ) space and absolute time , over which some relativistic corrections are added via the post - newtonian formalism . on the contrary",
    ", emission coordinates allow the definition of _ relativistic _ positioning systems whose study based on the framework and the concepts of general relativity was initiated by coll and collaborators several years ago @xcite .    at present global positioning systems",
    "consist of a non - inertial spatial reference frame for navigation that co - rotates with the earth and is geocentric ( the ecef , earth centered earth fixed system ) , and on the coordinate time of a local inertial star - fixed  reference frame whose origin lies at the earth s center of mass and which is freely falling with it ( the eci , earth centered inertial system ) . although clock speeds are small in comparison with the speed of light and gravitational fields are weak near the earth , they give rise to significant relativistic effects .",
    "the most important ones affecting the rate of clocks ( to the order @xmath0 , which is just the order of approximation used in gps ) are first and second order doppler frequency shifts of clocks due to their relative motion , gravitational frequency shifts due to the earth s mass , and the sagnac effect due to the earth s rotation @xcite .",
    "if these corrections were not made , the system would not be operational after a few minutes . in a day of operation",
    ", they would produce an error of more than 11 km in the horizontal positioning of the receiver . in a week , the error accumulated in the vertical positioning would be approximately 5 km",
    ". therefore , fully - relativistic positioning systems are not only conceptually simpler than gps systems , but also more accurate , because no corrections are needed at all , whereas post - newtonian corrections to current positioning systems are included up to the order @xmath0 only .",
    "recently the project sypor @xcite ( systme de positionnement relativiste ) has proposed to endow the constellation of satellites of galileo with the necessary elements to constitute by itself a primary , autonomous positioning system for the earth and its neighbors , referring to the capability of the constellation to provide complete relativistic metric information , i.e. , to describe both the kinematics and the dynamics of the constellation itself as well as of the users . in this primary positioning system",
    ", an observer at any event in a given spacetime region can know its proper coordinates .",
    "the system is also autonomous or autolocated if any receiver determines its spacetime path as well as the trajectories of the satellites solely on the basis of the information received during a proper time interval .",
    "hence , a constellation of satellites with clocks that interchange their proper time among themselves and with earth receivers is a fully relativistic system .",
    "according to the sypor project the galileo system would not need relativistic ",
    "corrections . giving a theoretical contribution to that project is the main motivation of the present work .",
    "the simplest relativistic positioning system is the one formed by electromagnetic signals broadcasting the proper times @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) of four independent clocks carried by satellites which move along geodesic ( i.e. , freely falling ) world lines .",
