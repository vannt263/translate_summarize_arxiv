    "topological superconducting states with or without broken time - reversal symmetry @xcite have recently come under increasing attention because of the possibility of realizing majorana fermions .",
    "majorana fermions , majorana , wilczek , nayak - wilczek , read - green , ivanov , stern , kitaev - qc , nayak - rmp defined by self - hermitian second quantized operators @xmath0 , are remarkable quantum mechanical particles which can be construed as their own anti - particles .",
    "recently it has been shown that a 2d electron - doped semiconductor with rashba type spin - orbit coupling in proximity to a bulk @xmath1-wave superconductor and an externally induced perpendicular zeeman splitting can support a topological superconducting phase with majorana fermion modes at vortex cores and sample edges .",
    "sau1,index - theorem , long - prb the proposal followed on an earlier similar proposal for topological superconducting states using spin - orbit coupling and zeeman fields made in the context of cold fermions .",
    "zhang - tewari , sato - fujimoto it has also been pointed out by alicea alicea - tunable that in the presence of dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling co - existing along with the usual rashba coupling , the topological superconducting state in electron - doped semiconductors can be realized with an in - plane zeeman field . since the in - plane zeeman field can be directly applied by an in - plane magnetic field which is free of the orbital effects , the geometry proposed by alicea is useful for producing topological superconductivity in two - dimensional electron systems .",
    "very recently it has also been shown @xcite that the generic luttinger hamiltonian applicable to the hole - doped semiconductors also supports topological superconductivity and majorana fermions in the presence of a perpendicular zeeman field in a manner similar to its electron - doped counterpart .",
    "the possibility of a larger value of the effective mass and spin - orbit coupling in @xmath2-type holes in a semiconductor quantum well makes the hole - doped systems an attractive candidate for realizing topological superconductivity that breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the strategy of producing topological superconductivity and majorana fermions using rashba spin - orbit coupling , parallel zeeman field , and @xmath1-wave superconductivity has also been applied to electron- and hole - doped one dimensional semiconducting wires .",
    "long - prb , roman , oreg , zhang - tewari-2 the one dimensional topological systems are particularly useful for constructing quasi - two - dimensional quantum wire networks @xcite which can potentially be used alicea - network , hassler - qc , sau - tewari - qc as platforms for non - abelian statistics @xcite and universal quantum computation @xcite in the bravyi - kitaev scheme.@xcite for the purpose of studying anomalous topological transverse response functions such as anomalous hall and nernst effects , in this paper we will confine ourselves to two - dimensional hole- and electron - doped semiconductor thin films .",
    "the substantive difference between the topological states in the electron and hole doped semiconductors lies in the fact that while the superconducting order parameter in the former is similar to the chiral @xmath2-wave ( @xmath3 ) type , the order parameter in the hole - doped system in a perpendicular zeeman field is predominantly chiral @xmath4-wave ( @xmath5 ) type .",
    "@xcite a strong perpendicular zeeman field , however , is difficult to realize experimentally with a magnetic field because of the unwanted orbital effects which are pair breaking.@xcite following ref .",
    "[ ] , in this paper we will introduce the geometry and hamiltonian for the hole - doped systems which can support topological superconductivity in the presence of an in - plane zeeman field making it easier to produce with a magnetic field .",
    "we will then analyze the berry phase mediated topological hall and thermoelectric effects in electron- and hole - doped systems under external conditions necessary for realizing topological superconductivity with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "note that , since we are considering the spontaneous or anomalous components of the hall and nernst effects , we will only treat two - dimensional systems in the presence of an _ in - plane _",
    "zeeman splitting .",
    "in all the systems mentioned above the chemical potential regime that corresponds to the topological state in the presence of proximity effect is characterized by a single ( or odd number of ) fermi surface which breaks the fermion doubling theorem.@xcite it has been argued that , in the limit of vanishing superconducting pair potential @xmath6 , the single ( or odd number ) of fermi surface at the chemical potential constitutes a necessary condition for the existence of topological superconductivity and majorana fermions at order parameter defects .",
    "kitaev-1d the breakdown of the fermion doubling theorem and topological superconductivity in all the above cases are achieved by the introduction of a strong zeeman splitting greater than at least the proximity induced superconducting pair potential @xmath6 . at such high values of the zeeman splitting the superconductivity itself survives because of the spin - chirality induced on the semiconductor fermi surface by a strong enough spin - orbit coupling.@xcite    the twin requirements of strong zeeman splitting as well as spin - orbit coupling on the semiconductor fermi surface manifest themselves in interesting berry phase@xcite mediated topological effects which have pronounced effects on the anomalous hall and thermoelectric coefficients .",
    "@xcite while these effects have been investigated previously , our focus in this paper is near the chemical potential regime - called topological regime hereafter - which supports topological superconductivity in the presence of @xmath7-wave proximity effect .",
    "we find that the topological regimes in both electron- and hole - doped semiconductors are marked by well - defined plateaus in the anomalous hall and nernst effects as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "the plateaus are not quantized , however , in the sense of quantized anomalous transport coefficients , because , even in the topological regime , the electron or the hole - doped systems are not fully gapped . rather , in this regime of chemical potential they have a single ( or odd number of ) fermi surface which supports , in the presence of spin - chirality induced by the spin - orbit coupling , the superconducting proximity effect .",
    "even so , in the topological regime , there is a clear separation in the momentum space between the region where the berry curvature is peaked ( near the ` band - degeneracy ' points in the absence of the zeeman splitting ) and the region where the fermi surface lies in the brillouin zone . since the nernst effect is strictly a fermi surface quantity at zero temperature , the vanishing of the overlapping region in the brillouin zone between the fermi surface and the berry curvature results in a vanishing anomalous nernst effect in the topological regime .",
    "the plateau in the nernst coefficient at vanishing magnitudes is flanked on either side of the topological regime by well - defined peaks ( of opposite signs ) arising from the emergence of a second small fermi surface which destroys topological superconductivity but gives rise to large peaks in the topological nernst effect .",
    "the results presented in this paper may be useful for experimentally deducing the topological regimes of the chemical potential in electron and hole - doped semiconductors supporting majorana fermions in the presence of proximity effect .",
    "as a particle moves adiabatically through a closed contour in its parameter space it acquires a geometric phase known as a berry phase . in a crystal lattice the wavefunctions for a band are written as @xmath8 according to bloch s theorem where @xmath9 is a bloch function with the periodicity of the lattice .",
    "the eigenfucntions are k dependent and the relevant paramater space is the space defined by the crystal momentum * k*. the berry connection , @xmath10 represents the geometric phase acquired by a bloch wave function through infinitesimal movement in k - space and is a vector potential . in analogy",
    "to electrodynamics the berry curvature is defined as the curl of this potential as @xmath11 which is berry phase per unit area .",
    "the berry curvature enters into the equations of motion of a wavepacket and is responsible for many intrinsic transport properties . for a system with time reversal symmetry and spatial inversion symmetry",
    "the berry curvature vanishes for all * k * so it is often ignored .",
    "the charge current in the presence of an electric field * e * and a temperature gradient @xmath12 can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the electric and thermoelectric conductivity tensors . in the hall effect a current is applied and a magnetic field is present perpendicular to a conducting sample . in this configuration an electric field is generated perpendicular to the current so that off diagonal terms of @xmath14 are non - zero .",
    "similarly for the nernst effect a current will arise normal to the temperature gradient when a perpendicular magnetic field is present .",
    "below we discuss the anomalous or topological hall and nernst effects for a system where there is no perpendicular magnetic field but there is still a contribution to the hall and nernst effects due to the presence of a non - trivial berry curvature .    in the presence of an electric field",
    "* e * , the group velocity of a bloch electron is written as @xcite @xmath16where the first term is the usual band dispersion and the second term is called the anomalous velocity .",
    "this anomalous velocity is responsible for the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous hall and anomalous nernst effects , with the berry curvature acting like a magnetic field in k - space . with the inclusion of the anomalous velocity it immediately follows that by summing the anomalous velocity over all occupied states the charge conductivity is written as,@xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the fermi distribution function",

    "@xmath23 can then be solved for by making use of the onsager relation @xmath24 .",
    "the transverse heat coefficient may be written as the velocity multiplied by the entropy density ,    @xmath25    where the entropy density of an electron gas is given as @xmath26 with @xmath27 as the fermi distribution function . using the above equation and this form for the entropy density ,",

    "we will deliberately choose quantum well configurations with appropriate spin - orbit couplings which will allow an in - plane zeeman field for the topological state so the conventional hall and thermoelectric effects make no contributions in experiments .",

    "the degeneracy between the two bands is lifted by the presence of both dresselhaus spin orbit coupling and the in - plane magnetic field .",

    "sau1,index - theorem , long - prb , alicea - tunable at higher @xmath55 the upper band becomes occupied , leading to a cancelation of the anomalous hall conductivity due to the equal magnitude but opposite sign of the berry curvatures of the two bands .    the anomalous nernst coefficient for an electron - doped semiconductor near the topological regime is plotted against @xmath55 in fig .",

    "the system has two ( or an even number of ) fermi surfaces one of which lies close to the band degeneracy point .",
    "this small fermi surface , because of a non - zero berry curvature , gives a finite contribution to the anomalous nernst effect which differs in sign between the regimes below and above the topological regime .",

    "the topological regime itself is characterized by a single ( or odd number of ) fermi surface with no weight near the band degeneracy points with significant berry curvatures .",
