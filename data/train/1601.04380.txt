    "the discriminants of the chebyshev @xmath0 and @xmath1 polynomials are given by simple and elegant formulas : @xmath2 and @xmath3 is there anything comparable for linear combinations or integral transforms of chebyshev polynomials ? for a special type of linear combination , formula was generalized in @xcite to @xmath4 where @xmath5 for various formulas related to this type of linear combination , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "what can be said about discriminants in @xmath6 of an integral transform @xmath7 where @xmath8 is some chebyshev polynomial ?",
    "our goal here is to show that the resulting polynomials have discriminants that factor in a remarkable way .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath9 the discriminant factors into two polynomials , one of which has coefficients that are much larger than the coefficients of the other .",
    "moreover , these two polynomials have `` almost '' the same roots , and their discriminants involve exactly the same prime factors .",
    "for example , when @xmath10 , these two polynomials are @xmath11 the discriminants of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the roots of @xmath12 rounded to 5 digits are @xmath16 whereas those of @xmath13 are @xmath17 we notice that in this case , the discriminants of these two polynomials have the same ( rather small ) prime factors . and",
    "except for the root 0.98272 of @xmath12 and 0.0032902 of @xmath13 , the remaining roots are pairwise close .",
    "in fact , for @xmath18 large we can show , after deleting one root from each of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , that the remaining roots can be paired in such a way that the distance between any two in a given pair is at most @xmath19 .",
    "we call the small polynomial @xmath12 the `` mutt '' polynomial and the large polynomial @xmath13 the `` jeff '' polynomial after two american comic strip characters drawn by bud fisher .",
    "they were an inseparable pair , one of whom ( `` mutt '' ) was very short compared to the other ( `` jeff '' ) .",
    "these two names are suggested by kenneth stolarsky .",
    "now , what will happen if we take the discriminant in @xmath20 of @xmath21 instead of taking the integral ?",
    "it is not difficult to show that this discriminant is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant depending on @xmath18 .",
    "as we will see , one remarkable property about the polynomial @xmath24 is that its discriminant has the same factors as the discriminants of our polynomials @xmath12 and @xmath13 and its roots are almost the same as those of these two polynomials .",
    "the main results are given by theorems 2 , 3 and 4 in sections 4 , 5 and 6 respectively . in section 2",
    "we provide the reader with a convenient summary of notations and properties of chebyshev polynomials , discriminants , and resultants .",
    "section 3 of this paper defines the mutt and the jeff polynomials .",
    "section 4 and 5 of this paper analyze the discriminants of @xmath13and @xmath12 .",
    "section 6 shows that the roots of these two polynomials are pairwise close after deleting one root from each .",
    "the discriminant of a polynomial @xmath25 of degree @xmath18 and leading coefficient @xmath26 is    @xmath27    where @xmath28 are the roots of @xmath25 .",
    "the resultant of two polynomials @xmath25 and @xmath29 of degrees @xmath30 and leading coefficients @xmath31 respectively is @xmath32 the discriminant of @xmath25 can be computed in terms of the resultant between this polynomial and its derivative @xmath33    in this paper we compute the discriminants and resultants of polynomials related to chebyshev polynomials . here",
    "we review some basic properties of the chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the chebyshev polynomial of the second kind @xmath1 has the derivative @xmath34    the derivative of the chebyshev polynomial of the first kind @xmath0 is @xmath35 the connections between these polynomials are given by @xmath36 mourad ismail @xcite applied the following theorem from von j. schur @xcite to compute the generalized discriminants of the generalized orthogonal polynomials :    let @xmath37 be a sequence of polynomials satisfying the recurrence relation @xmath38 and the initial conditions @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "assume that @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "ismail s idea is that if we can construct @xmath45 and @xmath46 so that @xmath47 then @xmath48 in the special case of the chebyshev polynomial satisfying the recurrence relation @xmath49 and the differental equation @xmath50 we obtain @xmath51 and @xmath52    for the discriminants of various classes of polynomials , see @xcite .",
    "in this section we will show that the discriminant of the integral transform of chebyshev polynomial factors into the square of the product of the mutt and jeff polynomials whose formulas will be provided . while the formula for the mutt polynomial can be given explicitly in terms of the chebyshev polynomials",
    ", we can only describe the jeff polynomial by its roots . by integration by parts",
    ", we have @xmath53    this is a polynomial in @xmath6 with the leading coefficient @xmath54    the discriminant of this polynomial in @xmath6 is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a rational number depending only on @xmath18 and can be different in each occurrence . also the factors of its numerator and denominator",
    "can only be 2 or factors of @xmath57 , @xmath58 . from this",
    ", we define the mutt polynomial @xmath59 also , we can define , within a plus or minus sign , the jeff polynomial @xmath13@xmath60 $ ] as the polynomial of degree @xmath61 whose coefficients are relatively prime and for which @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a suitable rational number .",
    "in this section , we find the factors of the discriminant of @xmath13",
    ". in particular we will prove the theorem :    the discriminant of @xmath13 has the same prime factors as those of the discriminant of @xmath24 .",
    "also @xmath64    since we do not have an explicit formula for @xmath13 , we will compute the discriminant as the square of the product of the distances between the roots .",
    "we first note that @xmath65 is a polynomial in @xmath66 whose leading coefficient is @xmath67 thus from , the factors of the leading coefficient of @xmath13 can only be 2 or factors of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath18 .",
    "we now consider the roots of @xmath13 .",
    "according to the formula , @xmath13 has @xmath61 real roots given by the formula @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the derivative formula implies that @xmath73 thus the equation gives @xmath74 hence the roots of @xmath13 can be written as below : @xmath75 thus from the definition of discriminant as the product of differences between roots , it suffices to consider the discriminant of @xmath24 . the formulas and give    @xmath76    we note that @xmath24 is a polynomial of degree @xmath61 with the leading coefficient @xmath77    from the definition of discriminant in terms of resultant and the formulas and , we have @xmath78 where @xmath79 can be computed from its trigonometric definition : @xmath80    thus @xmath64 thus @xmath81 has factors 2 , 3 , and factors of powers of @xmath18 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "in this section , we will present an explicit formula for the discriminant of @xmath12 and show that this discriminant also has factors 2 , 3 , and factors of powers of @xmath18 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "in particular , we will prove the theorem :    the discriminant of @xmath12 is @xmath82    we note that @xmath12 is a polynomial in @xmath66 of degree @xmath61 whose leading coefficient is @xmath83 . to compute @xmath84 we notice the following fact : @xmath85    from this ,",
    "we have @xmath86 thus the definition of discriminant yields @xmath87    where the value of the free coefficient of @xmath12 can be obtained from    @xmath88 by substituting this value to the equation above , we obtain @xmath89    to compute the product above , we follow an idea from jemal gishe and mourad ismail @xcite by writing @xmath12 as a linear combination of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in particular this combination can be obtained from and as below : @xmath92 thus @xmath93 where the last equality is obtained from . hence @xmath82 from this we conclude that the discriminants of @xmath12 and @xmath13 have the same factors 2 , 3 , and all the factors of @xmath18 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "in this section we will show that the roots of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are pairwise similar except for one pair .",
    "in particular , we will prove the theorem :      we first show that with one exception , the roots of @xmath12 and @xmath24 are pairwise close . from the definition ,",
    "the roots of these two polynomial are positive real numbers . to simplify the computations , we consider @xmath96 and the polynomial @xmath97 whose roots ( except 0 ) are the square roots of the positive roots of @xmath13 and @xmath12 respectively . and it will suffice to consider the positive roots of @xmath98 and @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath99 be a positive root of @xmath96 .",
    "we will show that for a certain small value @xmath100 , the quantities @xmath101 and @xmath102 have different signs and thus @xmath98 admits a root in the small interval @xmath103 .",
    "first , we observe that the equation gives @xmath104          to prove @xmath102 and @xmath109 have different signs , it remains to show that @xmath110 is sufficiently large in magnitude and has the same sign as @xmath101 .",
    "to ensure this fact , we first impose the following two conditions on @xmath111 :      where the value of @xmath113 and the existence of @xmath111 with respect to these conditions will be determined later . with these conditions ,",
    "we obtain the following lower bound for @xmath114 : @xmath115 we now need to show that @xmath116 is not too small compared to @xmath117 .",
    "the taylor formula gives @xmath118 where @xmath119 . from",
    ", we have , for @xmath120 , the following trivial bound for @xmath121 : @xmath122 thus the equation , with @xmath123 replaced by @xmath66 , implies that for large @xmath18 @xmath124         now the equation implies that @xmath116 and @xmath117 have the same sign and @xmath127 this inequality combined with and show that @xmath102 and @xmath101 have different signs if @xmath128 thus @xmath98 has a root in the interval @xmath129    next we will show that @xmath111 exists with respect to all the imposed conditions and that its value is small as soon as @xmath99 is not the smallest positive root of @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath99 be such a root . from , and",
    ", it suffices to show @xmath99 satisfies the identity @xmath130          from this graph , it suffices to show that @xmath99 is not too small and not too close to 1 .",
    "let @xmath132 be the second smallest root of @xmath96 .",
    "this root has an upper bound @xmath133 since the right side is the second smallest positive root of @xmath90 .",
    "the smallest positive root of @xmath90 is @xmath134          similarly , let @xmath142 be the largest root of @xmath96 .",
    "the trivial upper bound @xmath143 , the largest root of @xmath90 , does not guaranty the existence of @xmath113 .",
    "however for some @xmath144 we have @xmath145 the approximation yields @xmath146 thus @xmath147 now the condition is satisfied provided that @xmath148 .",
    "thus we can let @xmath113 be any value in the interval @xmath149 since for large @xmath18 , @xmath113 and @xmath111 are arbitrarily bigger than @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively , we have that for every root @xmath99 of @xmath96 except the smallest root , there is a root of @xmath98 in the small interval @xmath152 this implies that in each pair , the root @xmath153 of @xmath24 is bigger than the root of @xmath154 of @xmath12 by at most @xmath155 combining this fact with , we conclude that for every root @xmath94 of @xmath13 except the smallest root , there is a root of @xmath12 in the interval @xmath156 for large @xmath18 .",
