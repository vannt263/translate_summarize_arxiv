    "for example , there are issues surrounding recommendations based soley on usage data .",
    "while a particular resource was necessary in the past ( e.g.  the  elmo s abc book \" was needed for a colleague s child s birthday ) , it may not be a good predicator of future requirements ( e.g.  the child s birthday has passed ) .",
    "thus , the problem of recommendation is exacerbated by the fact that the requirements of an individual fluctuates according to their _ context _",
    "( i.e  their ever - changing resource requirements ) .    members of the scholarly community face a variety of contexts each with different resource requirements @xcite .",
    "for example , scholars may need to :    * identify articles related to some interesting resource , * identify collaborators for a funding opportunity , * identify a publication venue for a newly created article , * identify referees to review an article , and * identify resources of interest in one s community .",
    "this article presents a context - sensitive recommender system to support the scholarly communication process .",

    "kreef s abstract data model is the quad - based representation of the resource description framework ( rdf ) @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 is the set of all uniform resource identifiers ( uri ) , @xmath1 is the set of all blank / anonymous nodes , and @xmath2 is the set of all literals , then a quad - based rdf graph is defined as @xmath3 where any @xmath4 is called a quad ( or quad - based statement ) . the element @xmath5 is the subject , @xmath6 the predicate , @xmath7 the object , and @xmath8 the graph ( or context ) .",
    "it is the role of @xmath8 to partition triple - based rdf statements of the form @xmath9 .",

    "prior to the development and popularization of the quad concept , rdf stores were triple stores .",
    "triple stores only support the @xmath10 construct .",
    "however , it has become apparent that statement metadata ( i.e.  reification ) can be more efficiently represented using quads as opposed to the more verbose rdf : statement construct @xcite . in kreef , the @xmath8 component of a quad serves as an identifier denoting a specific user s graph . every time a user makes a statement , that statement is written to their graph  to their @xmath8 .",
    "currently , on the front - end , every user has a single graph unique to their account . in the future",
    ", users can have multiple graphs with different permissions .",
    "these permissions are controlled using access control list ( acl ) metadata @xcite .",
    "kreef uses neo technology s neo4j graph database as its quad store .",
    "neo4j makes use of a linked graph data structure in order to ensure optimal performance in graph traversals ( i.e.  vertices have direct pointer s to their adjacent vertices ) .",
    "as will be explained later in the article , kreef reasoning and recommendation is not accomplished through typical monotonic description logics and reasoners as popularized and proselytized by the semantic web community @xcite .",
    "instead , kreef performs reasoning and recommendation by means of the random walk algorithms popularized by the graph / network analysis community @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "a quad store architecture that is optimized for traversals is a necessary requirement of kreef .",
    "moreover , given the size of the scholarly community , a quad store that can scale to multiple billions of statements is another requirement .",
    "neo4j meets both these needs .",
    "as previously discussed , the abstract data model for kreef is a quad - based rdf graph . the ontologies ( or schemas ) to structure the data",
    "are discussed in this section .",
    "kreef currently maintains two ontologies : core and relation .",
    "the core ontology represents objectively determinable resource and relationship types found in the scholarly community ( see  [ sec : core ] ) .",
    "the relation ontology provides a set of predicates that are more subjective in nature ( see  [ sec : relation ] ) .",

    "the role of relation : related is presented in  [ sec : organize ] and  [ sec : news ] .",
    "the purpose of relation : usage is to track the  resource path \" that a user takes through kreef . when a user views one resource and then another , a relation : usage resource is created . for example , if at time step @xmath14 , a user views resource @xmath15 and then at @xmath16 the user views resource @xmath17 , then a relation : usage resource is created ( if one does not already exist between @xmath15 and @xmath17 in that user s @xmath8 ) .",

    "the purpose of the algorithm is to identify resources related to some initial set of seed resources .",

    "the grammar walker engine works as follows .",

    "also , only core : agent resources have their counter incremented as the traversed core : items are not coauthor - related to the seed resources . formally , if @xmath24 @xmath25 is the @xmath26-identity matrix , @xmath27 represents core : created , and @xmath28 represents core : createdby , then the graph traversed by the grammar walker is defined as @xmath29 . is the hadamard entry - wise multiplication operation .",
