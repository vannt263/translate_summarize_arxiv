    "thin films of ferromagnetic transition metals have been extensively studied in the last decades for their important applications .",
    "many investigations on the modification of their magnetic properties have been performed using different techniques . in particular ,",
    "ion bombardment demonstrated to be an efficient tool for this task @xcite .",
    "so far , experiments were performed on transition ferromagnetic metals and on some of their corresponding alloys .",
    "they demonstrated that ion bombardment does not affect the chemical composition of the films , but changes significantly structure and magnetic properties .",
    "these modifications are related to local changes of the film structure during the irradiation and to the implantation of ions .",
    "more precisely , dependencies on the ion specie , its penetration depth and irradiation dose , giving rises to changes on the coercivity , saturation magnetization and crystal lattice , have been observed @xcite .    in the this work ,",
    "we present recent studies on more peculiar magnetic material , namely the manganese arsenide , submitted to ion bombardment .",
    "mnas is a metallic compound that is ferromagnetic below t@xmath4  k where the first - order phase transition from hexagonal ( @xmath5 phase ) to orthorhombic ( @xmath6 phase , mnp type ) is accompanied by a ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition .",
    "the possibility of epitaxial growth of mnas thin films on standard semiconductors such as gaas has renewed interest for spintronic research @xcite .",
    "the epitaxial strain disturbs the phase transition that leads to the @xmath7 phase coexistence over a large range of temperatures ( 1045@xmath8c @xcite ) . in this range , an alternating structure of ridges ( @xmath5 phase ) and grooves ( @xmath6 phase ) organized in stripe - shaped domains",
    "is created to minimize the elastic energy due to the epitaxy .",
    "very recently , our group has started to study the change of these peculiar characteristics induced by the implantation of ne@xmath0 highly charged ions in the mnas epilayer .",
    "such changes may open new perspectives in the attractive possibility to maintain ferromagnetism in mnas to higher temperature than the bulk t@xmath9",
    ". a better knowledge of these damages will also provide important information about the robustness of this material in hostile radiation environment .",
    "production of the samples , irradiation and characterization have been entirely performed at the nanoscience institute of paris ( insp ) where a molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) system and an ion source equipped with a dedicated beam line ( simpa , french acronym for highly charged ion source of paris ) are available .",
    "after the irradiation , the sample is characterized by several techniques : moke for magneto - optical kerr effect , xrd for x - ray diffractometer and mfm for magnetic force microscope . in this paper , we detail the production of mnas / gaas films and the set - up for ion irradiation .",
    "first results and discussions of the bombarded films are presented .",
    "mnas epilayers are grown by mbe on gaas(001 ) substrate .",
    "the mnas growth is performed at 240@xmath8c on a prepared gaas substrate under as - rich conditions .",
    "a growth rate of about 100nm / h leads to a finally thickness of 150  nm .",
    "the deposed mnas is oriented with the @xmath5mnas @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath6mnas @xmath11 $ ] axis parallel to gaas@xmath12 $ ] . at the end of the growing processes",
    "the samples are capped in situ with an amorphous as layer in order to prevent the mnas oxidation .",
    "more details on the growing process can be found in @xcite .",
    "samples of same mnas / gaas growth with a surface of @xmath13  mm@xmath14 are obtained from the original wafer . once placed on a omicron sample holder ,",
    "the films are moved toward the simpa facility in atmosphere pressure .",
    "the ion irradiation are performed at the simpa facility that include an electron - cyclotron resonance ion source coupled to a dedicated beam line .",
    "the ion source can produce intense beams of highly charged ions such as ne@xmath0 , ar@xmath15 , xe@xmath16  after the extraction , the ion beam is selected in charge and mass by a auto - focusing magnetic dipole . with a series of magnetic and electric lenses ,",
    "the ion beam is transported to the collision chamber where the different samples are placed . in our particular case , we use a beam ne@xmath0 with a kinetic energy of the ions of 90  kev ( 4.5  kev / u ) and a maximum intensity of 1  e@xmath17a in the chamber .",
    "more details of the simpa installation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the samples are introduced in the collision chamber via an interlock equipped with a radiative oven ( see figure [ fig : chamber ] ) . in the interlock , once a pressure of few 10@xmath18  mbar is reached , each sample is slowly warmed up to 270@xmath8c and kept to this temperature for several hours in order to remove the as cap .",
    "once cooled back to room temperature , the sample is transferred to the sample - manipulator located at the center of the collision chamber .",
    "typical pressure of the chamber is @xmath19  mbar .",
    "the manipulator allows for xyz translation and a rotation long the axis perpendicular to the ion beam to regulate the incidence angle of the ions on the sample . during the irradiation ,",
    "the sample temperature can be controlled trough a series of k - type thermocouples and eventually changed with a thermal regulator composed by a peltier cooler between the sample holder and a water cooled component .    the ion beam profile and position are regulated and controlled by means of a high sensitive charged coupe device ( ccd ) and adjustable magnetic steerers and electrostatic lenses before the entrance of the chamber .",
    "the ccd , placed at an observing angle of about 80@xmath8 , images the ion collision florescence light produced either on the stainless steel surface mounted on the back of the sample - manipulator or on the sample itself .",
    "the ion beam current is measured with a removable faraday cup in front of the sample . the incidence angle between the ion beam and the sample surface",
    "is fixed to 60@xmath8 .",
    "this choice of angle enables to monitor the ion ",
    "sample collision region with the ccd camera and with an x - ray solid state detector during the irradiation time .",
    "the detection of the characteristic ne@xmath0 x - ray emission produced during the interaction of the ions with the sample provides , in fact , an additional control on the ion beam intensity during the irradiation .",
    "typical pictures of the sample illuminated from external light and under ion bombardment are presented in figure  [ fig : sample ] .         under these experimental condition , we determine from srim ( version 2008.04 @xcite ) that the ion implanted distribution covers the full mnas film thickness enhancing hence the dose effect @xcite . the simulations in figure  [ fig : srim ] show that only a very small fraction of ions is deposited in the gaas substrate excluding the possibility of mnas - gaas beam mixing .     at 90",

    "after the irradiation , the samples are removed from the interaction chamber to be analyzed .",
    "preliminary studies with moke techniques that measure the macroscopic magnetic response at the surface .",
    "this first results indicate that already with @xmath1  ions/@xmath3 no ferromagnetic behavior is observed .",
    "more systematic analysis are performed using xrd and mfm methods and they are presented in the following paragraphs .",
    "the acquisition of xrd data is performed using a panalytical xpertpro mrd diffractometer with a copper anode , generating cuk@xmath20 radiation and operating at 40  kv and 30  ma .",
    "the diffractometer is equipped with 4 circular cradles to move the sample with respect different angles for positioning and scanning .",
    "xrd patterns are recorded in the @xmath21 range @xmath22 , with a step of @xmath23 , and a 17  s time per step . with xrd measurements at grazing incidence angle , the thickness of the sample",
    "is determined before and after irradiation .",
    "all measurements are obtained at a temperature of @xmath24c , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 phases are normally present in non irradiated mnas / gaas films .",
    "data from irradiated films are compared with a reference decapped mnas / gaas sample issued from the same growth .",
    "mnas@xmath25 and @xmath6mnas@xmath26 plans as a function of the received doses ( in ions per @xmath3).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the thickness of the samples is found to remain constant whatever the ion dose ( within the range used here ) with a value around 150  nm demonstrating that sputtering effects are marginal . in opposite ,",
    "the bragg reflection spectra exhibits significant modifications as a function of the received dose , as seen in figure  [ fig : xrd ] . for the non irradiated sample , the @xmath5mnas@xmath25 and @xmath6mnas@xmath26 reflection peaks are clearly identified ( the @xmath6 peaks are much less intense at 20@xmath8c ) .",
    "the double peak structure is due to the cuk@xmath20 doublet used in the present spectrometer . for low doses ,",
    "the @xmath6mnas@xmath26 peak is still visible but seems to disappears for doses @xmath27  ions/@xmath3 . for doses around @xmath28  ions/@xmath3 , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 peaks are strongly distorted ending to a unique doublet at higher doses ( @xmath29  ions/@xmath3 ) .",
    "this bragg reflection could correspond to a new phase of mnas with ne implantation or to a modification of the @xmath5 or @xmath6 phases in analogy of the measurement on co films bombarded with xe ions reported in @xcite . in this previous work , local warming during the ion impact",
    "induces a phase transition between the hexagonal close packing ( hcp ) phase , stable in bulk co below 425@xmath8c , and the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) phase , stable at higher temperature .",
    "an analog phenomenon could appear in our case between the two mnas phases . to probe this aspect , additional measurements on magnetic properties",
    "are required to detect the presence or not of the ferromagnetic @xmath5mnas phase . as mentioned before",
    ", moke measurements suggest that mnas after ne bombardment has no macroscopic magnetic properties . for a closer investigation on the local magnetic properties on the surface",
    ", we used an mfm .",
    "the results are presented in the following section .",
    "the magnetic images of the sample surface are taken with a veeco dimension 3100 mfm equipped with a magnetic tip coated with co / cr ( model mesp ) and working at a temperature around 20@xmath8c . before each scan , the samples are magnetized long the surface in parallel to the easy axis of the mnas @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the orientation axis of the gaas substrates are indicated on each image . ]",
    "mfm images of the decapped samples before irradiation show ( see figure  [ fig : mfm ] left as an example ) the well defined and characteristic stripes of mnas on gaas due to the succession of @xmath5mnas and @xmath6mnas regions .",
    "we observed that , after irradiation , the shape of the stripes is more and more distorted and at @xmath31 ions/@xmath3 the stripes are completely vanished . instead , chaotic pattern with elongated regions parallels to the original stripes ( parallel to gaas@xmath12 $ ] ) appears , as it can be observed in figure  [ fig : mfm ] ( right ) . at higher irradiation doses , the phase contrast continues to decreases toward an almost complete disappearance .      due to the presence of the phase contrast of the mfm images",
    ", we can deduce that a local magnetic response is still present at relative at irradiation doses @xmath32 ions/@xmath3 but in a meantime , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 phases are not anymore distinguishable .",
    "in contrast , moke data , sensitive to the macroscopic magnetic response of the surface , show that no signal of ferromagnetic behavior is detected with samples irradiated with a dose equal or lower than @xmath33 ions/@xmath3 .",
    "this could indicate of a freezing of the magnetic domain alignment on the surface , even when an external field is applied ( as with moke ) .",
    "considering also the xrd data , we can emphasize that these new properties could be intrinsically connected to the presence of a new phase . to confirm or disprove this assertion , more investigation will be performed in the future .",
    "first investigation on the effect of ne@xmath0 highly charged ion bombardment on mnas / gaas thin film is presented . the structural and magnetic properties of the mnas film before and after irradiation",
    "are investigated using different techniques , namely , x - ray diffraction , magneto - optic kerr effect and magnetic force microscope .",
    "preliminary results indicated that ferromagnetic properties of irradiated samples are visible locally using mfm but strongly distorted when compared to non irradiated samples .",
    "xrd measurements indicate that this behavior could be linked on a presence of a strongly modified @xmath5 phase of mnas or even a new phase .",
    "more studies are in any case required .",
