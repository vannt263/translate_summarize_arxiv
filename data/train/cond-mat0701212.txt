    "bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) is a unique state of a many particle system where , ideally , all particles occupy the same single particle state .",
    "it is obviously possible for bosons only , and experimentally it can be realized in ultra - cold dilute atomic gases @xcite . since the first experimental realization numerous different phenomena involving bec",
    "have been investigated and nowadays it is also possible to obtain mixtures of becs or even mixtures of ultra - cold bosonic and fermionic gasses @xcite .",
    "two - component bec @xcite can reveal number of interesting phenomena , e.g. , phase separation @xcite , self - localization @xcite , condensate entanglement @xcite or internal josephson effects @xcite .    in an infinite homogeneous system",
    "the phase separation occurs abruptly once interactions reach their critical values @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show effects of a finite system .",
    "that is , in a finite box there is a region close to critical values of the coupling parameters where substantial density fluctuations can be observed .",
    "a standard theoretical description of a single condensate and condensate mixtures starts with the mean field gross pitaevskii equations @xcite that provide estimates for ground states and collective excitations of a system but under an assumption that it is described by perfect condensate product states .",
    "particle interactions , however , can lead to substantial depletion of the condensates @xcite and in order to obtain a more realistic picture usually a bogoliubov theory is applied , which allows one to describe small quantum corrections to the mean field solution @xcite .",
    "the key idea of the original bogoliubov theory @xcite ( usually used in the bec field ) is the @xmath0 symmetry breaking approach where the atomic field operator is assumed to have a nonzero expectation value .",
    "this _ coherent _ state necessarily involves superposition of states with different numbers of atoms , an assumption very far from experimental reality .",
    "moreover , careful analysis of the original theory shows that the bogoliubov - de  gennes equations correspond to an eigenvalue problem of an operator which is not diagonalizable and the theory must break down after a finite time @xcite .    to overcome these drawbacks we employ a number conserving version of the bogoliubov theory , which has been presented by castin and dum @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) for a one - component bec and generalized to a two - component system by srensen @xcite , and analyze the bogoliubov vacuum state of a mixture of two becs .",
    "the two theories should give the same physical predictions for large particle numbers .",
    "there are , however , examples of systems where the @xmath1-conserving theory works in a regime of the standard theory breakdown @xcite .",
    "the bogoliubov vacuum is usually obtained in the quasi - particle representation where quantum depletion , i.e. the number of particles occupying non - condensate modes can be easily calculated for a given system @xcite .",
    "to gain insight into the form of the ground state of the system , we derive the bogoliubov ground state in the particle representation .",
    "this enables us to perform simulations of density measurements in single experiments @xcite .    for a single condensate the leggett ansatz of the vacuum for translationally invariant systems",
    "@xcite has been shown to be valid in any inhomogeneous condensates in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show that the ansatz can be used also in the two - component case even in the presence of the inter - species interaction . the obtained bogoliubov vacuum state is then used in an analysis of density fluctuations in 3d homogeneous condensates and in condensates trapped in a double well potential .",
    "it turns out that vicinity of the critical point for the phase separation is especially interesting because the fluctuations there become considerable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the solution for the bogoliubov vacuum state in the particle representation , derived within the number conserving version of the bogoliubov theory . in sec .",

    "corrections @xmath17 and @xmath18 are thus supposed to be small and we may perform expansion of the hamiltonian in powers of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the zero order , condition for energy extremum in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 space leads to coupled gross - pitaevskii equations h_gp^a_a0=0 , & & h_gp^b_b0=0 , [ gper ] where h_gp^a&=&- ^2+v_a+g_an_a|_a0|^2+gn_b|_b0|^2-_a , h_gp^b&=&- ^2+v_b+g_bn_b|_b0|^2+gn_b|_b0|^2-_b , & & ( with chemical potentials @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) that allow us to find single particle modes macroscopically occupied by atoms .",
    "the first order terms of the hamiltonian disappear . in the second order",
    "one obtains an effective hamiltonian which , employing the bogoliubov transformation , can be written in a diagonal form h_eff_n``+ '' e_n c_n^c_n , [ efffin ] where the sum goes over the so - called family `` + '' solution of the bogoliubov equations ( see appendix a ) .",

    "the quasi - particle representation is thus natural to represent the system eigenstates within the bogoliubov theory .",
    "it is also suitable to obtain low order correlation functions .",
    "however , to get predictions for density measurements , i.e. to simulate measurements of all atom positions , the particle representation turns out to be much more convenient .    in the appendix b",

    "average particle density corresponds to the reduced single particle density which can be easily calculated within the bogoliubov theory @xcite .",

    "instead one may use a sequential method proposed by javanainen and yoo @xcite .",
    "it relies on a choice of a position of a subsequent atom with the help of a conditional density probability which takes it into account that previous atoms have already been found at certain positions .",
    "note that , since this method requires acting with particle annihilation operators on the bogoliubov vacuum , using the bogoliubov state in the quasi - particle representation would require inversion of the nonlinear transformation ( [ boper ] ) .",
