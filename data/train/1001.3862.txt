    "tunneling ionization of molecules in strong infrared fields is the first step in many interesting strong - field phenomena such as high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , emission of high - energy above - threshold ionization ( hati ) electrons and non - sequential double ionization ( nsdi ) .",
    "essential understanding to these processes is the angle - dependent ionization probability @xmath0 for a molecule fixed in space , where @xmath1 is the angle between the molecular axis and the polarization direction of the laser s electric field .",
    "since molecules are generally not fixed in space , i.e. , not at a fixed alignment and/or orientation , experimental determination of @xmath0 from partially aligned molecules requires additional assumptions .",
    "@xcite first determined @xmath0 from nsdi processes where the alignment of the molecule is determined by coulomb explosion of the molecular ions .",
    "@xmath0 can also be determined by ionizing partially aligned molecules @xcite , or by measuring the angular distribution of electrons removed by a circularly polarized laser @xcite . in both methods",
    "the alignment of the molecular axis is determined by coulomb explosion when the molecular ion is further ionized by an intense circularly polarized laser . in all of these measurements ,",
    "the @xmath0 is not determined directly for a fixed angle and some approximations are used in order to determine the alignment - dependent ionization probability .",
    "theoretically , @xmath0 can in principle be obtained directly from numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) . however , even for the simplest h@xmath2 , the @xmath0 obtained from solving tdse by different groups still exhibits relatively large differences . while calculations of @xmath0 for interesting multielectron molecular systems have been carried out using the time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the accuracy of these calculations is difficult to evaluate . furthermore , these calculations are rather time - consuming . beside these",
    "_ ab initio _ approaches , alignment - dependent tunneling ionization rate for molecules can be calculated using simple models such as the molecular strong field approximation ( sfa ) @xcite , or the molecular tunneling ionization theory @xcite .",
    "the latter is the simplest and is a generalization of the tunneling model of ammosov , delone and krainov ( adk ) @xcite for atoms . in the molecular tunneling ionization model ( mo - adk ) of tong",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the ionization rate for a molecule aligned at an angle @xmath1 with respect to the laser polarization axis is given analytically .",
    "the ionization rate depends on the instantaneous electric field of the laser , the ionization potential of the molecule and some structure parameters of the orbital wavefunction in the asymptotic region .",
    "subsequent further extension of the mo - adk theory can be found in @xcite .    in tong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the structure parameters are extracted from molecular wavefunctions calculated using the multiple scattering method @xcite .",
    "however , these days molecular wavefunctions are more easily accessible from quantum chemistry packages such as gamess @xcite , gaussian @xcite and others .",
    "thus it is desirable to obtain structure parameters from the asymptotic behavior of orbitals calculated from such packages .",
    "this was carried out for co@xmath3 by le _",
    "_ @xcite and for other molecules by kjeldsen and madsen @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , molecular orbitals from these chemistry packages are calculated using gaussian basis functions and they are not suitable for representing the exponential decay of the wavefunction at large distances .",
    "as more accurate experimental data are becoming available , it is essential to redetermine these structure parameters more accurately . since the asymptotic wavefunction does not contribute much to the total energy of a molecule",
    ", one can not efficiently improve the asymptotic wavefunctions by enlarging the size of the gaussian basis directly .    in this paper",
    ", we describe how to improve the asymptotic wavefunction where the structure parameters are extracted .",
    "our input consists of wavefunctions of all the occupied orbitals obtained from gamess or gaussian .",
    "we then construct a single - active - electron model potential and solve the time-_in_dependent schrdinger equation to obtain the molecular orbital wavefunctions by an iterative procedure .",
    "the details of the method are given in section ii .",
    "we then apply the method to redetermine all the structure parameters previously published in @xcite , and adding structure parameters for some inner orbitals .",
    "we also determine the structure parameters for a number of systems that have been investigated experimentally . using these new structure parameters we examined the alignment dependence of ionization probabilities for several systems . in most cases ,",
    "the new results do not differ much from what were presented in tong _ et al .",
    "however , there are differences in some molecules .",
    "the strong deviation in co@xmath3 has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "the theory part is divided into three subsections . we first present the method of generating a single - active - electron model potential for linear molecules .",
    "we then discuss how to calculate the wavefunctions by solving the time-_in_dependent schrdinger equation with b - spline basis functions .",
    "we will also briefly describe how to extract the structure parameters in the mo - adk theory .",
    "single - active - electron model potential approach has been widely used for describing atoms in strong - field physics ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has also been used for molecular targets recently @xcite .",
    "the one - electron model potential consists of two parts : electrostatic and exchange - correlation terms .",
    "it is well - known that the traditional local - density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation potential does not give the correct ( @xmath4 ) potential in the asymptotic region where the structure parameters are to be extracted . in this paper , we follow abu - samha and madsen @xcite and use the lb potential , proposed by leeuwen and baerends @xcite , which will give the correct asymptotic @xmath4 behavior for neutral atoms and molecules .",
    "we note that a similar lb potential , called lb@xmath5 @xcite , has also been used by chu and collaborators in their tddft approach @xcite .    for linear molecules ,",
    "the model potential can be expressed in single - center expansion as @xmath6 here , @xmath7(r ) is the radial component of the model potential and @xmath8 the legendre polynomial .",
    "typically we choose @xmath9 .",
    "the radial potential is given by @xmath10 where the first two terms represent the electrostatic potential and the last term is the exchange interaction .",
    "the electron - nucleus interaction @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 runs over the @xmath14 atoms in the molecule . without loss of generality , we assume that linear molecules are aligned along the @xmath15-axis , then @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath17 with @xmath18=min(r,@xmath19 ) , @xmath20=max(r,@xmath19 ) . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the nuclear charge and the @xmath15 coordinate of the @xmath13th atom , respectively .",
    "the partial hartree potential @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25=min(r,@xmath26 ) , @xmath27=max(r,@xmath26 ) .",
    "here @xmath28 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total electron density in the molecule and @xmath31 here @xmath13 runs over all the @xmath32 electrons in the molecule .",
    "the wavefunction of each molecular orbital can be obtained from quantum chemistry packages such as gamess @xcite or gaussian @xcite .    for the partial exchange potential ,",
    "it is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the lda potential for an electron with spin @xmath36 @xmath37^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 here @xmath13 runs over the @xmath39 electrons that have the same spin as the active electron .",
    "the gradient correction term is given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath42 are chosen to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively throughout this paper .",
    "we note that for more accurate binding energies , the correlation potential should be included into eq .",
    "( 9 ) . in the so - called lb@xmath5 model , the two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath42",
    "are usually chosen to be @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ( see , @xcite ) .      with the model potential constructed in the previous subsection",
    ", the wavefunction for the active electron in a linear molecule can be obtained by solving the following time-_in_dependent schrdinger equation @xmath47\\psi_{n}^{(m)}(\\bm{r})=e_{n}\\psi_{n}^{(m)}(\\bm{r})\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the eigenfunction and eigenvalue , respectively .    using single - center expansion for the electronic wavefunction @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the spherical harmonics , the radial wavefunction can be constructed with b - splines @xcite @xmath52 substituting eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) into eq .  ( 13 ) and then projecting onto the @xmath53 basis , we obtain the following matrix equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are obtained by diagonalizing eq .",
    "( 16 ) .      in the asymptotic region , typically only a few terms in the single - center expansion eq .",
    "( 14 ) are important .",
    "following tong _",
    "@xcite , we write the wavefunction of a linear molecule as @xmath57 in the mo - adk theory @xcite , the radial functions in the asymptotic region are fitted to the following form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the asymptotic charge , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the ionization energy .",
    "in this paper , the single - active - electron model potential [ see sec .",
    "ii a ] is created with the dft , in which the exchange potential is constructed with the exchange - only lda potential and the lb model potential ( or lda+lb ) .",
    "first we check the quality of this model potential if the molecular orbitals obtained from the standard quantum chemistry package gamess @xcite are used as the input .    in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we compare the present r - weighted lb potential with the empirical model potential of tong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for ne .",
    "for clarity we plot the effective charge , defined as @xmath62 .",
    "the two potentials agree well in the small @xmath63 region",
    ". however , there are significant differences at large @xmath63 . for neutral atoms , the effective charge should approach -1 at large @xmath63 .",
    "if the lb potential is calculated directly using the molecular wavefunctions from gamess ( dashed line ) the effective charge exhibits oscillations and then drops rapidly with @xmath63 . this undesirable behavior is due to the incorrect electron density , which in turn is due to the limitation of the gaussian basis , calculated from gamess in the large @xmath63 region . to correct this error ,",
    "we perform one more iteration on the potential : firstly , an initial model potential is generated using the hartree - fock ( hf ) wavefunctions obtained from gamess . from this initial potential ,",
    "more accurate wavefunctions are obtained by solving eq .",
    "( 13 ) with b - spline basis .",
    "then , a new model potential is constructed from these new wavefunctions . from fig .",
    "1(a ) , we observe that the effective charge obtained after one iteration ( solid line ) shows the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to molecules . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we show the model potential of co@xmath3 along the molecular axis , with and without one iteration .",
    "it confirms that the asymptotic behavior of the model potential is correct after one iteration .",
    "we comment that in the case of co@xmath64 diffuse functions have been included in the basis sets .",
    "clearly , this alone is insufficient for obtaining accurate electron density ( or potential ) at large @xmath63 .",
    "once the model potential is obtained , the eigenfunction and eigenvalue can be calculated from solving eq .",

    "our method uses the same approximate exchange potential as in ref .",

    "in this paper we proposed a new method to obtain accurate molecular wavefunctions in the asymptotic region starting with molecular orbitals obtained from the widely used quantum chemistry packages such as gamess and gaussian . from these wavefunctions , the structure parameters in the molecular tunneling ionization theory ( mo - adk ) of tong _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite can be accurately determined . using these structure parameters ,",
    "we re - examined the alignment - dependent tunneling ionization probabilities for a number of molecules , including ionization from homo-1 and homo-2 orbitals .",
    "the calculated tunneling ionization probabilities are compared to probabilities determined from experiments , and to several other more elaborated calculations . since tunneling ionization",
    "is the first step for strong field phenomena involving molecular targets , these structure parameters are useful and thus are tabulated . the procedure for obtaining",
    "the structure parameters discussed in this paper is generally applicable to any linear molecules . despite of its fundamental importance , accurate strong field",
