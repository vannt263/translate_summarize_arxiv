    "weak gravitational lensing due to large scale structure ( cosmic shear ) has become a promising source of cosmological information . a new generation of ground- and space - based surveys suited for precision weak lensing measurements have been developed with the importance of this new probe in mind .",
    "these ongoing , future , and proposed surveys ( e.g. cfhtls , des , euclid , hsc , hst , jwst , lsst , pan - starrs , and wfirst ) promise to provide greatly improved measurements of cosmic shear using the shapes of up to billions of galaxies . there has been much work done to explore the potential of these cosmic shear measurements , which we review in @xcite , for both the 2- and 3-point cosmic shear correlations .    beyond the constraints obtained on cosmological parameters from the 2-point cosmic shear correlation and the corresponding shear power spectrum , the 3-point cosmic shear correlation and shear bispectrum are able to break degeneracies between the cosmological parameters that the power spectrum alone does not @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite , for example , showed that the constraints on the dark energy parameters and the matter fluctuation amplitude should be able to be improved by a further factor of 2 - 3 using the bispectrum measured in a deep lensing survey .",
    "most recently , parameter constraints were derived by @xcite using weak lensing data from the hst cosmos survey , measuring the third order moment of the aperture mass measure .",
    "their independent results were consistent with wmap7 best - fit cosmology and provided an improved constraint when combined with the 2-point correlation .",
    "the bispectrum also allows us to explore information about non - gaussianity in the universe that is inaccessible at the 2-point level , providing constraints on the degree of non - gaussianity in addition to the information on other cosmological parameters ( see for example @xcite and references therein . )    however , several systematic effects limit the precision of cosmic shear measurements , which must be accounted for in order to make full use of the potential of future weak lensing surveys ( see for a summary @xcite and references therein ) , and one of the serious systematic effects of weak lensing is this correlated intrinsic alignment of galaxy ellipticities , which act as a nuisance factor ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . the dark energy equation of state can be biased by as much as @xmath1 , for example , if intrinsic alignment is ignored @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the matter power spectrum amplitude can be affected by up to @xmath2 due to the intrinsic alignment , demonstrating the importance of developing methods to isolate and remove the intrinsic alignment from the cosmic shear signal .    .",
    "]    there are two 2-point intrinsic alignment correlations .",
    "the first is a correlation between the intrinsic ellipticity of two galaxies , known as the intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity ( ii ) correlation , between two intrinsically aligned galaxies .",
    "the second , known as the gravitational shear - intrinsic ellipticity ( gi ) correlation , was identified by @xcite and is due to a matter structure both causing the alignment of a nearby galaxy and contributing to the lensing signal of a background galaxy .",
    "the large - scale gi correlation was first reported by @xcite in the sdss , with @xcite finding an even stronger gi correlation for luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) .",
    "the authors showed that this contamination can affect the lensing measurement and cosmology by up to @xmath3 , while affecting the matter fluctuation amplitude by up to @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite confirmed this through numerical simulations , where a level of contamination of @xmath3 was found .",
    "the gi correlation was also measured in the sdss dataset by @xcite and @xcite , and most recently , @xcite measured strong 2-point intrinsic alignment correlations in various sdss and megaz - lrg samples .",
    "similarly , when we consider the 3-point correlation , the gravitational shear - gravitational shear - gravitational shear ( ggg ) bispectrum suffers from contamination by the 3-point intrinsic alignment correlations .",
    "the first correlation is between the intrinsic ellipticities of three spatially close galaxies which are intrinsically aligned by a nearby matter structure , known as the intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity ( iii ) correlation .",
    "the second is the gravitational shear - intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity ( gii ) correlation , where a matter structure which contributes to the lensing of a galaxy in the background also intrinsically aligns two spatially nearby galaxies .",
    "finally , there is the gravitational shear - gravitational shear - intrinsic ellipticity ( ggi ) correlation , where a matter structure which intrinsically aligns a galaxy in the foreground also lenses two galaxies in the background .",
    "the sign of the ggi and gii correlations can depend both on triangle shape and scale .",
    "the 3-point intrinsic alignment correlations are represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ giifig:3ptia ] .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that compared to the lensing spectrum , the lensing bispectrum is typically more strongly contaminated by galaxy intrinsic alignment , up to @xmath4 compared to the ggg lensing signal .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the iii and gii intrinsic alignment correlations can be greatly reduced with photo - z s by using cross - spectra of galaxies in two different redshift bins so that the galaxies are separated by large enough distances to assure that the tidal effect is weak .",
    "however , as shown in fig . 4 of @xcite , while the iii bispectrum is supressed almost totally for adjacent , large redshift bins , the gii bispectrum is not .",
    "thus we propose an extension to the ggi self - calibration technique @xcite for the gii bispectrum below .",
    "there has been significant work in recent years toward measuring and removing the effect of galaxy intrinsic alignment on cosmological measurements , and we review these briefly .",
    "the 2-point intrinsic alignment correlations and methods for their removal have been well studied in recent literature ( see for example @xcite ) . using a geometrical approach , @xcite generalized the nulling technique to the 3-point ggi correlation by exploiting its redshift dependence , but it was found that the technique throws out some of the valuable lensing signal . finally , we have recently generalized the approaches of @xcite and @xcite to develop a set of 3-point self - calibration techniques .",
    "we proposed using additional galaxy density ( cross-)correlations which are already present in weak lensing survey measurements to self - calibrate the ggi cross - correlation in @xcite , while the unique redshift dependencies of the intrinsic alignment bispectra allowed us to self - calibrate the intrinsic alignment auto - correlations in @xcite .",
    "we propose here an extension to the ggi self - calibration technique of @xcite , developing a technique to self - calibrate the gii cross - correlation bispectrum . while the impact of the gii cross - correlation on cosmological information is significantly less than the impact of the ggi cross - correlation , especially for widely separated redshift bin combinations",
    ", it still has a contribution for adjacent redshift bin combinations , which must be measured and removed if one hopes to achieve precision , systematic free bispectrum measurements . to do this ,",
    "we develop a relationship between the gii and galaxy density - intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity ( gii ) bispectrum .",
    "we also devise an estimator to measure the gii bispectrum from the observed galaxy density - ellipticity - ellipticity bispectrum .",
    "we then discuss the performance of such a self - calibration technique , describing both measurement and systematic errors due to the self - calibration .",

    "we construct photo - z redshift bins with width @xmath20 , centred at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "redshifts below @xmath23 are excluded , not because of poor performance in the gii self - calibration technique , but rather due to the weaker lensing signal at low redshifts , which artificially inflates the fractional errors we evaluate in sec .",
    "[ giierror ] .",
    "these errors are measured with respect to the lensing signal , and thus lower photo - z bins are not useful in evaluating the true performance of the gii self - calibration .    the intrinsic alignment self - calibration techniques ( gii and ggi ) both rely upon two basic observables measured in a weak lensing survey : galaxy surface density and galaxy shape . the galaxy surface density , @xmath24 , is a function of the 3d galaxy distribution @xmath25 in a given photo - z bin . the galaxy shape is expressed in terms of ellipticity , which measures the cosmic shear @xmath26 . however , the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies contaminate the cosmic shear .",

    "<S> we extend the 3-point intrinsic alignment self - calibration technique to the gravitational shear - intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity ( gii ) bispectrum . the proposed technique will allow the measurement and removal of the gii intrinsic alignment contamination from the cross - correlation weak lensing signal . </S>",
    "<S> while significantly decreased from using cross - correlations instead of auto - correlation in a single photo - z bin , the gii contamination persists in adjacent photo - z bins and must be accounted for and removed from the lensing signal . </S>",
    "<S> we relate the gii and galaxy density - intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity ( gii ) bispectra through use of the galaxy bias , and develop the estimator necessary to isolate the gii bispectrum from observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the gii self - calibration technique performs at a level comparable to that of the gravitational shear - gravitational shear - intrinsic ellipticity correlation ( ggi ) self - calibration technique , with measurement error introduced through the gii estimator generally negligible when compared to minimum survey error . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the relationship between the gii and gii bispectra typically allows the gii self - calibration to reduce the gii contamination by a factor of 10 or more for all adjacent photo - z bin combinations at @xmath0 . for larger scales , we find that the gii contamination can be reduced by a factor of 3 - 5 or more . </S>",
    "<S> the gii self - calibration technique is complementary to the existing ggi self - calibration technique , which together will allow the total intrinsic alignment cross - correlation signal in 3-point weak lensing to be measured and removed .    </S>",
