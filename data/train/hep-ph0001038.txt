    "the breaking of chiral symmetry and the confinement of quarks and gluons are two of the most important properties of qcd .",
    "the details of the mechanism leading to confinement are still largely unknown , and the understanding of non  perturbative dynamics in qcd in general is still rather poor .",
    "a new picture of the confinement mechanism and of chiral symmetry breaking was developed by v.n .",
    "gribov @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is based on the phenomenon of supercritical charges which can occur in qcd due to the existence of very light quarks .",
    "its consequence is a dramatic change in the vacuum structure of the light quarks compared to the usual perturbative picture at small coupling .",
    "the phenomenon of supercritical charges is well  known in qed ( for an extensive review see @xcite ) .",
    "the energy of the bound ",
    "state levels in the field of an isolated heavy nucleus decreases if the charge @xmath2 of the nucleus is increased . when the charge exceeds a critical value .",
    "] of @xmath3 , the lowest bound  state level dives into the dirac sea , i.e.  sinks below @xmath4 .",
    "as a consequence an electron from the ( filled ) continuum undergoes a transition into this level , and a positron is emitted .",
    "the electron is said to ` fall onto the center ' .",
    "in this situation the simple quantum mechanical picture breaks down , and the emerging bound state is in fact a collective state with a high probability to find an electron very close to the nucleus .",
    "this mechanism is called supercritical binding .",
    "the condition for its occurrence is that the compton wavelength @xmath5 of the electron is much larger than the radius of the heavy charge .",
    "gribov s confinement scenario is based on the idea that a similar phenomenon occurs in qcd due to the existence of very light ( almost massless ) quarks .",
    "the crucial point is that in this scenario already the color charge of a single quark is supercritical .",
    "since this applies also to the light quarks themselves the situation is more involved than in qed .",
    "we will give only a condensed description of the resulting scenario here .",
    "more detailed accounts have been given in @xcite . in order to get an understanding of the underlying physical picture we again use the quantum mechanical description , having in mind that the quantitative analysis should be based on the full underlying quantum field theory .",
    "the confinement of heavy quarks in gribov s scenario is very similar to the supercritical binding in qed . due to its supercritical charge",
    "the heavy quark captures a light antiquark from the vacuum , thus decaying into a supercritical heavy  light bound state . at the same time",
    "a light quark is created .",
    "this light quark decays again , as we will discuss now .",
    "in order to understand the confinement of light quarks , we first consider a bound state of a light quark and a light antiquark .",
    "if the coupling constant is small this is just a normal bound state like positronium in which the quarks have positive kinetic energy .",
    "if we now increase the coupling the binding energy will also increase .",
    "the total energy of this state will thus decrease .",
    "but if the coupling is further increased  and becomes supercritical  a situation is possible in which the total energy of the bound state becomes negative . in order to have a stable vacuum",
    ", however , the existence of negative energy particles has to be avoided .",
    "consequently , the corresponding quark states in the supercritical bound states have to be filled in the vacuum . therefore there are filled quark states with positive kinetic energy in addition to the usual filled states in the dirac sea ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : newvac ] ) .",
    "the scale @xmath6 separating filled and empty states of positive kinetic energy resembles the fermi surface in solid state physics .",
    "the existence of the additional states in the vacuum of light quarks implies also the existence of additional excitations of this vacuum which have quite unusual properties .",
    "the @xmath7 pair of such an excitation forms a supercritical bound state in which the quark and antiquark both have negative kinetic energy .",
    "they are interacting repulsively , and the supercritical bound state has positive total energy . the ` binding force ' leading to this unusual meson is the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the quark and antiquark are bound in this meson because all other energetically possible states in the vacuum are already filled .",
    "having discussed the emergence of the novel meson states , we can now understand the confinement of light quarks .",
    "according to gribov it is caused by the continuous decay of the light quark .",
    "any quark ( with positive or negative kinetic energy , @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) decays into a supercritical bound state @xmath10 and a quark @xmath9 of negative kinetic energy , q _ ( )",
    "m + q_(- ) . in this sense",
    "the quark exists only as a resonance and can not be observed as a free particle .",
    "since the existence of the novel meson states is due to the pauli principle it is immediately clear that the above confinement mechanism works only for quarks but not for gluons .",
    "but the confinement of gluons could possibly be a ` second order effect ' in gribov s scenario , namely due to their coupling to light quarks which subsequently decay as described above .",
    "it is obviously desirable to find a quantitative description for this interesting physical picture of supercritical color charges .",
    "the confinement of quarks and gluons should be encoded in the singularities of the respective green functions .",
    "therefore the green function of the quark is a suitable object to study in this context . in @xcite gribov",
    "derived an equation for the retarded green function of light quarks .",
    "it takes into account especially the dynamics of the infrared region but also reproduces asymptotic freedom at large momenta .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking has been found to occur when the strong coupling constant exceeds a critical value , leading to the emergence of goldstone boson ( pions ) .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that the nature of these goldstone bosons is such that they should in fact be regarded as elementary objects .",
    "corrections to the green function caused by these goldstone bosons are expected @xcite to lead a green function of light quark which exhibits confinement , whereas the equation without these corrections is not expected to imply confinement @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the paper @xcite remained unfinished , and a full study of the analytic properties of the green function and their consequences still remains to be done .",
    "especially , it will be important to see how and to what extent the  though somewhat simplified  physical picture described above can be derived from the analytic properties of the resulting green function .",
    "gribov s equations for the green function of light quarks ( with or without pion corrections ) are non  linear differential equations .",
    "so far the studies of these equations @xcite have been performed only by means of asymptotic expansions .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to perform a complete numerical study of the equation without pion corrections .",
    "this allows us to study the breaking of chiral symmetry also quantitatively and in more detail .",
    "we also investigate the analytic structure of the green function resulting from gribov s equation .",
    "it turns out that in gribov s equation the critical value of the strong coupling constant is surprisingly low , @xmath11 . in the derivation of the equation",
    "it is assumed that the coupling constant does not become very much larger than this critical value . to some extent gribov s approach",
    "can thus be considered as a semi  perturbative approach to confinement .",
    "this picture might also explain why we observe an essentially smooth behaviour of non  perturbative effects in the transition from the parton level to the hadron level .",
    "typical multiplicities at the parton level , for example , are in surprising correspondence to those observed at the hadron level ( for a more detailed discussion of this and similar observations see @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of an infrared finite coupling has also been widely discussed in the context of power corrections and the dispersive approach to renormalons in qcd @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein . in that approach",
    ", it appears consistent to define an effective running coupling down to very low momentum scales , in the sense that its first moments have a universal meaning .",
    "the values of the coupling found in the corresponding experimental analyses are in fact bigger than the critical value in gribov s equation .",
    "the equation can be derived from the dyson ",
    "schwinger equation for the green function of the quark in feynman gauge .",
    "the approximations made in the derivation are motivated by the underlying physical picture , especially concerning the behaviour of the strong coupling constant .",
    "this method can therefore also be viewed as an unconventional approach to the difficult problem of solving the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations in qcd ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the approximations usually made in solving the dyson  schwinger equations are intrinsically difficult to control .",
    "comparisons with results obtained in gribov s approach will therefore be potentially very useful .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ eqsection ]",
    "we outline the main steps leading to the equation for the green function of light quarks and describe some of its most important properties . in section [ param ] a suitable parametrization of the green function",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the equation for small and large momenta is discussed and the critical value of the strong coupling constant is derived .",
    "section [ imeuklidischen ] deals with the euclidean region of space  like momenta . in section [ asymfree ] the solutions",
    "are shown to exhibit asymptotic freedom at large space  like momenta .",
    "section [ models ] provides models for the running coupling at small ( space  like ) momenta which are needed for the numerical analysis of the equation .",
    "the possible types of solutions in the euclidean region are classified in section [ solutionseucreg ] .",
    "the characteristic change in the solutions at supercritical coupling is discussed .",
    "section [ secmassren ] deals with the behaviour of the dynamical mass function of the quark in the euclidean region .",
    "phase transitions are found to occur for supercritical coupling and lead to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we study how this effect depends on the models used for the running coupling in the infrared . in section [ analyticstruct ]",
    "we determine the analytic structure of the solutions in the whole momentum plane for the different types of solutions classified in section [ solutionseucreg ] .",
    "we close with a summary and an outlook .",
    "the results presented in sections [ asymptbe ] and [ asymfree ] concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the equation have partly been obtained already in @xcite .",
    "they have been included in some detail in the present paper since they are immediately relevant to our analysis and serve to make it self  contained .",
    "in this section we will outline the main steps that lead to the equation for the green function of light quarks and and highlight some of its properties which are relevant to our discussion .",
    "some of these properties and the full derivation of the equation have been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the first step is the choice of a gauge .",
    "as noted by gribov , the feynman gauge turns out to be particularly well suited for deriving a simple equation which is especially sensitive to the infrared dynamics .",
    "in other gauges it would be extremely difficult to find a similarly simple equation .",
    "the physical results , like for example the occurrence of chiral symmetry breaking , will of course be independent of the choice of gauge . in feynman gauge the gluon propagator has the form [ effphot ] d_(k ) = - _ s(k^2 ) .",
    "the exact behaviour of the strong coupling constant @xmath0 is not known at small momenta . in gribov",
    "s derivation of the equation it is assumed that the coupling constant is a slowly varying function of the momentum and does not become very large at small momenta .",
    "such a behaviour is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : kopplung ] .",
    "it turns out that the occurrence of a supercritical behaviour of the green function does not depend on the details of the coupling in the infrared , as long as its value is above the critical value in some interval of momenta .",
    "as we will see , this critical value is rather low , @xmath1 .",
    "these properties of the running coupling are consistent with the picture arising in the dispersive approach @xcite to power corrections in qcd ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "there it appears that the definition of a running coupling constant at very low momenta is possible in the sense that its integral moments have a universal meaning .",
    "motivated by this , possible models for the coupling have been constructed , see for example @xcite . for our numerical study",
    "we will choose a rather simple form of the coupling , see section [ models ] below .",
    "one starts from the dyson ",
    "schwinger equation for the inverse green function @xmath12 of the quark and considers its perturbative or diagrammatic expansion . to the corresponding sum of diagrams",
    "one applies the double differentiation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the derivative with respect to the external momentum @xmath15 of the quark .",
    "firstly , this is a way to regularize the divergences in these diagrams , and gives a finite result .",
    "secondly , it can be used to collect the most singular contributions to the quark green function from the infrared region .",
    "this is based on the observation that the action of @xmath16 on the gluon propagator in feynman gauge gives a delta function , ^2 = - 4 ^2 i ^(4)(q - q ) .",
    "[ deltafunktion ] the integration variables in all diagrams can be arranged in such a way that the external momentum of the quark is carried along gluon lines .",
    "if a gluon line is now differentiated twice , the above identity then transforms the integral over the corresponding gluon momentum into two zero  momentum gluon insertions .",
    "all other contributions to the respective integrals  those with derivatives in different lines or of the running coupling  are clearly less singular in the infrared region .",
    "it is in principle possible to treat these terms systematically as corrections .",
    "but the resulting equation will then be a complicated integro  differential equation , as briefly indicated in @xcite . in first approximation those contributions",
    "are neglected , and one is left with a series of diagrams with two gluon insertions that carry zero momentum .",
    "this sum can be shown to be the diagrammatic expansion of a full inverse quark green function with two full quark ",
    "gluon vertices @xmath17 inserted . using ward identities the latter",
    "can be replaced by derivatives @xmath18 of the quark green function .",
    "having eliminated the vertex functions , one ends up with a second order differential equation for the green function of a light quark , ^2 g^-1 = g ( ^g^-1 ) g ( _ g^-1 ) , [ gribgl ] where g = c_f .",
    "[ qcddefg ] this is gribov s equation which will be the subject of our study .",
    "a comment is in order concerning the choice of scale of the running coupling in ( [ qcddefg ] ) .",
    "as described so far , the derivation of the equation has concentrated on the most important contributions from the infrared region .",
    "but it is of course desirable to find an equation which describes the green function correctly also in the ultraviolet region .",
    "the use of the relation ( [ deltafunktion ] ) implies that the coupling has to be evaluated at zero momentum .",
    "but it can be shown that by replacing @xmath19 by @xmath20 one arrives at an equation that also reproduces the correct behaviour at large momenta .",
    "given the assumptions about the running coupling discussed earlier , the correction induced by this replacement is subleading as far as its contribution to the infrared region is concerned . in the approximation",
    "presently considered we can therefore accept equation ( [ gribgl ] ) with ( [ qcddefg ] ) as an equation that is expected to provide an adequate description of the green function at all momentum scales .",
    "for simplicity , equation ( [ gribgl ] ) is written for one  flavour qcd .",
    "this is sufficient as long as we are mainly interested in the occurrence of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the generalization to the more realistic case of a doublet of light quarks is straightforward and will be important for the study of bound states in gribov s picture .",
    "the fact that equation ( [ gribgl ] ) is a second order differential equation implies that its solutions will involve two dimensionful constants of integration .",
    "these will be related to the quark mass and the quark condensate .",
    "an obvious and important property of the equation is its invariance under a rescaling of the green function , @xmath21 for any constant @xmath22 . as a consequence",
    ", the equation will not involve the full wave function renormalization but only its logarithmic derivative .",
    "the equation is not scale invariant with respect to the momentum .",
    "the breaking of scale invariance is due to the presence of the running coupling constant .",
    "it is only through the running of the coupling that a momentum scale is introduced .",
    "a further property of the equation is a certain symmetry between the green function @xmath23 and its inverse @xmath12 .",
    "one can easily show that the equation ( [ gribgl ] ) implies ^2 g = ( 2 - g ) ( ^g ) g^-1 ( _ g ) .",
    "this means that @xmath23 solves the same equation as @xmath12 , but with @xmath24 replaced by @xmath25 , the symmetry point being @xmath26 . at @xmath27 ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath28 , the green function would thus become a free green function .",
    "this symmetry is certainly unphysical , and we should trust the equation only for comparatively small values of the coupling , roughly speaking below one or two .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that in the derivation of the equation the coupling was assumed to be small .",
    "due to invariance under parity and lorentz transformations the inverse green function has the general form [ ab ] g^-1(q ) = a(q^2 ) q- b(q^2 ) with two scalar functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we will in the following use the variable [ defofq ] q , such that the half plane @xmath31 already covers the full plane in @xmath32 , the variable in which the green function is usually discussed",
    ". it will be convenient to use instead of ( [ ab ] ) the following parametrization of the green function , [ parametrisierung ] g^-1 = - ( - ) with two complex functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this corresponds to a(q^2 ) & = & [ parama ] + b(q^2 ) & = & in the parametrization ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "the dynamical mass function @xmath10 of the quark is then given by the function @xmath34 only , [ massenfkt ] m(q^2 ) = = q , whereas the function @xmath33 represents the wave function renormalization . in terms of the usual notation",
    "we have @xmath35 .",
    "we further introduce q = and denote the derivative with respect to this variable as ( q ) = _ f(q ) , since the solutions of gribov s equation ( [ gribgl ] ) depend only on the logarithmic derivative of the wave function renormalization , it is useful to define [ defp ] p = 1 + . where = 1 - g = 1- c_f .",
    "then the equation ( [ gribgl ] ) for the green function translates into a pair of coupled differential equations for @xmath36 and @xmath34 , [ pdot ] p = 1 - p^2 - ^2 ( ^2 + 3 ^2 ) [ phidotdot ] + 2 p- 3 = 0 , which will be the basis of our further analysis .",
    "we now study the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of gribov s equation .",
    "an important outcome of this study will be the determination of the critical coupling at which chiral symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "first we keep the coupling constant fixed .",
    "the running of the coupling can then be treated under the assumption that the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions depends smoothly on the coupling .",
    "this assumption will be justified by our numerical analysis further below . since the equations ( [ pdot ] ) and ( [ phidotdot ] ) depend only on the logarithm of @xmath37 the equations are the same along all straight lines passing through the origin of the complex @xmath37-plane .",
    "the initial conditions , at @xmath38 for example , do not exhibit this apparent symmetry such that the solutions will be different in different directions in the @xmath37-plane .",
    "the fixed points of the equation , however , turn out to be independent of the direction in the @xmath37-plane .      for large @xmath40",
    "the pair of equations ( [ pdot ] ) , ( [ phidotdot ] ) has stable fixed points at [ phifix ] = ( 2 n+1 ) i ( n ) ; p = .",
    "as we will see in section [ asymfree ] the existence of these fixed points implies the asymptotic freedom of the corresponding solutions .",
    "the periodicity of the above fixed points is obvious from the equations , and we will now concentrate on the fixed point at @xmath41 . perturbing the solutions around the fixed point , = i+ ;",
    "p = p_0 + and expanding to first order in the perturbations we find [ p_0 ^ 2 ] p_0 ^ 2 = 1 + 3 ^2 > 0 .",
    "further we have _ = - 2 p_0 , such that @xmath42 with some @xmath43 . for a stable fixed point",
    "we thus have to choose the positive root @xmath44 in ( [ p_0 ^ 2 ] ) .",
    "we note that the function @xmath33 consequently develops a singularity ~ [ ] .",
    "the linearized equation for @xmath45 becomes [ psilin ] + 2 p_0 + 3 = 0 .",
    "thus @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "we find [ gampm ] _",
    "= - p_0 . here",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 can be real ( @xmath50 ) or complex ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "as we will see in section [ secmassren ] these two possible cases have quite different physical consequences .",
    "in the first case , @xmath52 , the function @xmath34 approaches @xmath53 monotonically .",
    "this case is characterized by g < g_c = 1- 0.18 or [ gwiederunterkrit ] g > 1 + 1.82 . here",
    "we find the critical value of the coupling constant @xmath0 already mentioned earlier , _",
    "c = g_c 0.43 , at which the solutions change their behaviour .    in the second case , @xmath51 , the function @xmath34 oscillates while approaching the fixed point @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding supercritical behaviour of the equation is characterized by values of the strong coupling constant @xmath0 in the interval _",
    "c < _ s < 4.3 .",
    "the emergence of the upper limit is in agreement with the symmetry of the equation relating the green function to its inverse for @xmath54 , see section [ eqsection ] .",
    "the fact that the equation exhibits subcritical behaviour at very large values of the coupling is certainly unphysical .",
    "we can not expect that the equation describes the green function correctly also at very large coupling .      for small @xmath40",
    "there are two possible cases . in the first case , @xmath34 approaches one of the fixed points described above , @xmath56 . to show this one can proceed as in the case of large @xmath40 .",
    "but now we are considering @xmath57 and therefore have to choose the negative root in ( [ p_0 ^ 2 ] ) in order to find a stable fixed point , @xmath58 .",
    "again , the solutions will oscillate while approaching the fixed point if the coupling is supercritical .",
    "the other case possible for @xmath59 is that @xmath34 vanishes at @xmath38 .",
    "linearizing the equation for small @xmath34 results in [ linphiqklein ] + 2 p_0 - 3 = 0 . from the equation for @xmath36 we find that for this fixed point @xmath60 with @xmath61 . with the ansatz @xmath62",
    "it is required that @xmath63 for @xmath34 to be regular .",
    "in order to have a solution which at large @xmath37 approaches @xmath53 with damping we need @xmath64 and therefore @xmath65 . the easiest way to see this is from eq .",
    "( [ glfuerepsilon ] ) and the corresponding discussion in section [ imeuklidischen ] below .",
    "the running of the coupling can be treated assuming that the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions depends smoothly on it .",
    "the values of the function @xmath36 at the fixed points discussed above depend on @xmath66 .",
    "therefore they are changed accordingly , i.e.  have to be replaced by @xmath67 or @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the oscillations occurring for @xmath69 stop at the scale at which the coupling becomes smaller than @xmath70 , and @xmath34 approaches the fixed point monotonically above this scale .",
    "we first investigate the equation in the euclidean region , i.e.  for space  like momenta .",
    "therefore we want to consider purely imaginary values of our variable @xmath37 , thus @xmath71 with a real  valued and positive @xmath72 .",
    "the derivative with respect to @xmath72 will be denoted [ defqprime ] f= f(q ) . for space",
    " like momenta the dynamical mass function @xmath73 is required to be real  valued .",
    "( [ massenfkt ] ) then implies that @xmath34 is purely imaginary .",
    "in addition , a real  valued mass function requires that the function @xmath36 is real  valued for space  like momenta . for convenience",
    "we define for the use in the present section = i , where @xmath74 is real  valued . in this section",
    "we thus have to consider only real  valued functions @xmath74 and @xmath36 depending on the real parameter @xmath72 .",
    "the equation ( [ phidotdot ] ) for @xmath74 ( or @xmath34 , respectively ) can be reformulated in such a way that it permits a simple interpretation .",
    "the function [ defepsilon ] - 3 ( 1- ) can be interpreted as the energy of a motion with @xmath74 being a one  dimensional degree of freedom .",
    "the equation of motion equivalent to ( [ phidotdot ] ) is [ glfuerepsilon ] _",
    "= - 2 p ^2 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath74 can then be interpreted as a motion with damping ( given by @xmath36 ) in the potential [ potentialv ] v = - 3 ( 1- ) .",
    "this potential has minima at @xmath75 for all @xmath76 .",
    "thus for space  like momenta the fixed points discussed in section [ asymptbe ] appear as the minima of the potential @xmath77 .",
    "for large @xmath78 the green function should behave according to perturbative renormalization and exhibit asymptotic freedom .",
    "we now show that gribov s equation reproduces exactly this behaviour for solutions that approach one of the fixed points discussed above .",
    "this is done by considering the leading terms in the limit of large @xmath72 .",
    "we first consider the wave function renormalization .",
    "the corresponding renormalization constant is in our parametrization defined as [ defwellenrenorm ] = e^z^-1 ( ) = q z^-1 , as can be seen when eq .",
    "( [ parama ] ) is evaluated at @xmath79 .",
    "as is usually done we assume @xmath80 to be a slowly varying function .",
    "using ( [ defp ] ) and ( [ pdot ] ) one derives in the limit @xmath81 the following equation for @xmath33 , [ asympglrho ] ( _ + 3)(_- 1 ) + 3 g - g ( _ ) ^2 = 0 . inserting ( [ defwellenrenorm ] ) and neglecting terms of the order @xmath82 and @xmath83 we find [ wellenrenorm ] _",
    "z^-1 + g z^-1 = 0 .",
    "this coincides with the well  known wave function renormalization in feynman gauge as it can be found for example in @xcite . turning to mass renormalization",
    "we observe that close to one of the fixed points , @xmath84 with small @xmath85 , the mass function is given by ( see eq .",
    "( [ massenfkt ] ) ) [ mfuerrein ] = 2 e^- m ( ) = .",
    "linearizing eq .",
    "( [ phidotdot ] ) we find [ linsigmamass ] + 2 ( 1 + ) + 3 = 0 .",
    "we further note that due to ( [ defwellenrenorm ] ) and ( [ wellenrenorm ] ) = 1 + = 1 - g . together with ( [ mfuerrein ] ) this can be inserted in ( [ linsigmamass ] ) . neglecting the term of order @xmath86 we arrive at [ massenrenormgl ] _",
    "m = - g m , which is exactly the mass renormalization at one loop .",
    "its solution is [ massenrenorm ] m(q^2 ) = m_0 [ ] ^_m , where @xmath87 is the mass at a given scale @xmath88 , and in one  loop approximation the exponent is @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "taking into account also the sub ",
    "leading solution for @xmath85 from ( [ linsigmamass ] ) or , equivalently , from ( [ psilin ] ) we find that @xmath85 behaves at large @xmath72 as [ sigmacondensate ] ~ + , as can be seen from ( [ gampm ] ) since in this limit @xmath91 .",
    "accordingly , the mass function behaves as m(q^2 ) ~m_q - .",
    "we thus find two dimensionful parameters , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these can be identified with the quark mass and a quark condensate , respectively .",
    "it is difficult to disentangle the two terms in ( [ sigmacondensate ] ) numerically .",
    "we will therefore not pursue this interesting issue any further in the present paper .",
    "the behaviour of the strong coupling constant is only very vaguely known in the infrared region . in order to perform a numerical study we have to use a model for @xmath0 .",
    "the model is required to be in agreement with the general assumptions used in the derivation of the equation ( see section [ eqsection ] ) .",
    "obviously , any useful model should coincide with the perturbative running of the coupling at large momentum scales . in the following",
    "we will use two different models of this kind .",
    "both are rather simple but should be sufficient for studying the physical effects resulting from gribov s equation .",

    "although the renormalized mass is the small  momentum limit of the dynamical mass function it would most probably be too simple to interpret it as a constituent mass of the quark .",

    "( [ massenrenorm ] ) . for our purposes",
    "it turns out to be sufficient and more convenient for the numerical study to choose a definition which involves only a finite momentum scale .",
    "we therefore define the perturbative mass as the value of the mass function at the scale @xmath128 at which the coupling becomes subcritical ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : kopplung ] ) and the perturbative behaviour is expected to set in , [ defpertmass ] m_p= m(^2 ) = . obviously , the scale @xmath128 in this definition depends on the model for the running coupling . in the models a and b discussed in section [ models ] , and presumably in most other realistic models , the values of @xmath128 are very similar .",
    "any other choice of scale would lead to similar results as long as that scale is chosen larger than @xmath128 .",
    "a general property of the solutions of gribov s equation is the rapid decrease of the mass function with increasing momentum .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mabfall ] for two solutions that are similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pert ] .    both solutions in this figure",
    "do not exhibit oscillations since they correspond to comparatively small values of @xmath109 ( see also the corresponding discussion in section [ solutionseucreg ] ) .",
    "it is now interesting to study the relation between the renormalized mass @xmath110 and the perturbative mass @xmath127 .",
    "first we consider the case of subcritical coupling .",
    "we choose model b for the running coupling with a maximal value @xmath129 .",
    "since the coupling is subcritical for all momenta the scale @xmath128 can not be defined via the critical value @xmath70 in this model .",
    "therefore we have to supplement the definition ( [ defpertmass ] ) of the perturbative mass with the choice @xmath130 in this case .",
    "this choice is to some extent arbitrary .",
    "it is mainly motivated by the values of @xmath128 resulting from the models a or b with supercritical @xmath19 .",
    "other choices for @xmath128 in the subcritical case lead to similar results for the dependence of @xmath110 on @xmath127 .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2munter ] .    for subcritical coupling",
    "there is a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between renormalized mass @xmath110 and perturbative mass @xmath127 .",
    "the renormalized mass decreases with decreasing perturbative mass , and vanishes when the perturbative mass vanishes .",
    "chiral symmetry is thus not broken at subcritical coupling .    if the coupling is supercritical at small momenta some of the solutions exhibit oscillations .",
    "these are possible until the running coupling becomes subcritical , i.e.  as long as @xmath131 .",
    "there are also monotonic solutions for which @xmath110 has to be sufficiently large ( see section [ solutionseucreg ] ) .",
    "let us consider one of the latter .",
    "the corresponding function @xmath74 has a certain value at the scale @xmath128 .",
    "but there are also solutions @xmath74 with smaller @xmath132 which oscillate and pass @xmath106 twice .",
    "it is now possible that one of these solutions has the same value at the scale @xmath128 as the monotonic solution considered before .",
    "there can in fact be even more solutions with this property , among them also solutions with negative @xmath110 ( resp .",
    "negative @xmath109 ) .",
    "the number of these solutions will ( for @xmath133 , see below ) remain finite .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "a solution @xmath74 which oscillates very often will be very close to @xmath106 due to the strong damping in the corresponding equation . as a result",
    "there is a maximal possible @xmath134 which the solutions can reach for a given number of oscillations . in summary , we find that different values of @xmath110 ( resp",
    ".   @xmath109 ) can lead to identical values of @xmath134 .",
    "but since the perturbative mass @xmath127 depends only on this value @xmath135 ) , see ( [ defpertmass ] ) , the correspondence between the renormalized and the perturbative mass is no longer one  to  one . instead it takes the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2 m ] ,    and the renormalized mass becomes a multi  valued function of the perturbative mass .",
    "here we have chosen model b for the running coupling , thus @xmath136 .",
    "further we have chosen @xmath137 in this figure because the effect is more pronounced at large coupling .",
    "the dependence on the coupling strength and on the model will be studied below .",
    "the figure has been obtained by integrating the differential equation up to @xmath138 with varying initial conditions @xmath109 .",
    "[ fig : m2 m ] shows that at supercritical coupling the renormalized mass does not vanish in the limit of vanishing perturbative mass , and we thus find that chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "this figure is one of our main results and we will now study it in some more detail . at large perturbative mass",
    "there is only one branch of solutions , denoted as @xmath139 in the figure .",
    "but if the perturbative mass is below a critical mass @xmath140 there are two additional solutions with different renormalized mass , denoted as the branches @xmath141 , @xmath142 in the figure , and we can regard this as a phase transition in the vacuum of light quarks .",
    "if we consider only the region of positive perturbative masses we can identify the branch @xmath139 with monotonic solutions , whereas the branch @xmath142 corresponds to solutions in which @xmath74 passes @xmath106 .",
    "further , the branch @xmath141 can be identified with solutions in which @xmath74 passes @xmath106 and in addition has a turning point .",
    "we observe that the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2 m ] is symmetric with respect to the origin .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the fact that the equations ( [ pdot ] ) , ( [ phidotdot ] ) are invariant under the exchange 2 i - .",
    "the mass function changes sign under this transformation , and hence the symmetry .",
    "the phase transition at the critical value @xmath140 of the perturbative mass @xmath127 is not the only one .",
    "in fact there is an infinite series of similar phase transitions taking place in the limit @xmath143 .",
    "the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2 m ] exhibits a very interesting self  similarity which illustrates this series of phase transitions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ausschn ] we show a detail of fig .  [ fig : m2 m ] around the origin .",
    "both figures show different parts of the same curve .",
    "we denote the critical mass of the second phase transition as @xmath144 .",
    "in the two additional solutions occurring at this scale the function @xmath74 passes the value @xmath106 twice .",
    "it is interesting to note that in each phase transition one of the two additional branches of solutions has the quite unusual property that the renormalized mass grows with decreasing perturbative mass .",
    "the phase transitions lead to the generation of pions as goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "the bethe  salpeter amplitude of the pion can be shown to be @xmath145 with a constant @xmath146 .",
    "it solves an equation for @xmath147 bound states which is derived in a similar approximation scheme as the equation for the green function @xcite .",
    "it has been speculated that the observation of just one pion in nature should restrict the physical value of the perturbative mass of the quark to be between the first and second phase transition @xcite . as can already be seen from figures [ fig : m2 m ] and [ fig : ausschn ] , however , two successive phase transitions happen to take place at mass scales which differ from each other by two orders of magnitude . therefore it is not possible to deduce any considerable restriction on the physical perturbative mass of the quark in this way .",
    "it is now instructive to study the dependence of the critical mass scales on the value and on the model chosen for the running coupling .",
    "for this we use the two models a and b for the running coupling introduced in section [ models ] .",
    "there we did not yet define how to vary the coupling strength in model a. we will use the value @xmath19 at vanishing momentum as a parameter ( as in model b ) and adjust the value of @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ kopplungma ] ) accordingly to obtain a running coupling of varying strength in this model as well .",
    "of course , the condition ( [ intofcoupling ] ) will then no longer be fulfilled . in model",
    "b the momentum scale @xmath128 at which the coupling becomes critical is independent of the value @xmath19 , but in model a it depends by construction on the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "since this dependence is rather weak and in order to make the results comparable we use also for model a the fixed value @xmath136 which is obtained for model b.    fig .",

    ". as expected , the critical mass then grows with increasing coupling .",
    "realistic values of the coupling are roughly of the order @xmath148 ( model a ) , corresponding to @xmath149 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : mc2 g ] we see that in this region both models give very similar values for the critical mass @xmath140 in the range of a few mev .",
    "only for perturbative quark masses below this small @xmath140 we expect chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with gribov s physical picture according to which exactly the existence of very light quarks with masses below of few mev leads to a dramatic change in the vacuum structure .    at very large values of the coupling",
    "there is a maximum and the critical mass decreases again . for model",
    "b this maximum is reached at @xmath150 , and for model a it is found at @xmath151 ( outside the range shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mc2 g ] ) .",
    "this seemingly strange behaviour has its origin in a property of the equation that we notices already in sections [ asymptbe ] .",
    "there we found that the oscillations in the solutions @xmath74 around the value @xmath106 disappear at very large coupling @xmath152 .",
    "had we chosen a fixed value for @xmath0 instead of a running @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc2 g ] we would have found in fact that the critical mass vanishes again at @xmath153 .",
    "but in our models the running coupling is a continuous function . even for arbitrarily large @xmath154",
    "it has in some momentum range values which make oscillations possible , and @xmath140 does not vanish even at large coupling .",
    "obviously , this is true for all possible continuous shapes of the running coupling .",
    "we therefore expect that the occurrence of chiral symmetry breaking due to this mechanism is largely independent of the details of the running coupling at small momenta .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcstrich2 g ] we show the second critical mass @xmath144 as a function of the coupling .",

    "the interpretation in terms of a renormalized mass is more involved than in the solutions of the first class discussed above .",
    "this is because here we find @xmath155 ( second class ) or @xmath156 ( third class ) , respectively .",
    "according to ( [ massenfkt ] ) this implies that a renormalized mass defined as the limit of the mass function at zero momentum , see ( [ defmr ] ) , would always vanish .",
    "nevertheless , it should be possible to define a quantity similar to the renormalized mass @xmath110 at some intermediate but small momentum scale . in the second and third class of solutions",
    "the behaviour at large momenta is similar to that of the first class , especially concerning the oscillations .",
    "given a suitable definition of a renormalized mass in the above sense one would therefore observe similar phase transitions and the breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "a full interpretation of the renormalized mass , especially for the second and third class of solutions , remains to be found .",
    "most probably this would require a better understanding of the difficult problem of the emergence of a constituent mass of the quark .",
    "so far we have discussed the properties of the solutions of gribov s equation in the region of space  like momenta .",
    "now we turn to the problem of determining the corresponding analytic structure of the green function in the whole momentum plane .",
    "the locations and nature of the singularities in the complex @xmath32 plane contain crucial information about the solutions , especially about their properties regarding causality and confinement .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that a suitable solution for the retarded green function of a confined quark should be free of singularities in the physical region @xmath157 .",
    "the analysis of the first class of solutions ( see section [ solutionseucreg ] ) in @xcite has shown that we should not expect to find such a confining solution of the equation without pion corrections .",
    "we will confirm that result and extend it also to the two other classes of solutions .",
    "as a first step we need to define the coupling constant in the whole complex momentum plane .",
    "this problem , however , is poorly understood even at large momenta since the one  loop formula for the running coupling does not possess a unique analytic continuation .",
    "obviously , the situation is even worse at low @xmath40 . in order to avoid additional parameters and artificial singularities we will therefore make the simplest possible assumption and choose a fixed coupling throughout the complex @xmath37-plane .",
    "the value of this coupling will be chosen to be supercritical , and in the examples below @xmath158 .",
    "we have to hope that this choice will be a suitable approximation at least for small @xmath40 .",
    "for large @xmath40 our choice seems less appropriate .",
    "but it will turn out that the singularities of the green function occur at comparatively small values of @xmath40 , probably indicating that an adiabatic modification of the coupling at large @xmath40 would not change the analytic structure . obviously , the choice of a constant and supercritical coupling disagrees with the models for @xmath0 we have used to find the solutions in the euclidean region .",
    "the details of the solutions will in fact change at large space  like momenta .",
    "but we have checked that the classification of the solutions given in section [ solutionseucreg ] remains valid .    in order to study the analytic structure",

    "some typical contours are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wege ] .    in general ( especially for the solutions of the second and third class ) the contours need not start in the origin of the @xmath37-plane .",

    "obviously , these solutions do not lead to confined quarks .",
    "let us now consider the solutions of the second class in which @xmath34 runs from @xmath165 to @xmath166 in the euclidean region .",
    "these solutions have been obtained in section [ solutionseucreg ] by choosing at some point @xmath167 on the imaginary @xmath37-axis the initial values @xmath168 and @xmath121 .",
    "( this is the ` symmetric ' case , for the other case see below . )",
    "we find that in all solutions of this kind the green function develops a pole exactly on the circle with radius @xmath169 , with a cut starting at the pole .",
    "the exact position of the pole depends on the value chosen for @xmath170 .",
    "( in this section we give this parameter of the solutions in terms of @xmath74 rather than in terms of @xmath34 since @xmath170 is real  valued and in order to make it easier to compare with the preceding section .",
    "we recall that the functions are related by @xmath171 and the derivative is with respect to @xmath172 , see eq .",
    "( [ defqprime ] ) . ) for small values of this parameter the pole is close to the real @xmath37-axis , and can in fact be shifted arbitrarily close to the real axis by choosing sufficiently small @xmath170 . for larger values of this parameter",
    "the pole moves along the circle towards the imaginary @xmath37-axis . in all cases",
    "the pole is found in the physical region above the real axis .",
    "in addition , there are two further poles and cuts in the physical region .",
    "these two poles are located under the same polar angle in the @xmath37-plane . for smaller values of @xmath170",
    "they are located closer to the real axis , and the one located at smaller @xmath40 moves closer to the origin , whereas the other one moves to larger distances from the origin . at all",
    "three poles the function @xmath33 vanishes . as an example",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : adrueberschnitt ] the function @xmath173 for the same solution which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adrueber ] in the euclidean region , i.e.  for the solution obtained from @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the shape of the cuts in the figure is due to the choice of the contours of integration .",
    "the corresponding poles can be found again by looking at the function @xmath36 .",
    "their positions can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : adrueber ] as the points where the contour lines meet .",
    "there are further singularities in the unphysical region which we do not discuss here .",
    "there are further solutions in the second class which we called ` asymmetric ' in section [ solutionseucreg ] in which the zeros of @xmath34 and @xmath36 in the euclidean region do not coincide .",
    "also these solutions have a singularity in the physical region on the circle on which @xmath121 is chosen on the imaginary @xmath37-axis . as in the ` symmetric ' solution this pole",
    "can be shifted very close to the real axis but not below it .",
    "the ` asymmetric ' solutions also have further singularities but we will not discuss them here .    finally , there is the third class of solutions in which @xmath34 stays close to @xmath53 throughout the euclidean region . here",
    "the situation is similar to the one for the solutions of the second class .",
    "we find a pole and a cut on the circle on which on the imaginary @xmath37-axis @xmath121 .",
    "again this is the case for the ` symmetric ' solutions ( in which @xmath121 coincides with @xmath41 on the imaginary axis ) as well as for the ` asymmetric ' solutions . as an example we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : adrinpole ] the analytic structure of the ` symmetric ' solution that we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adrin ] . the crosses and lines correspond to the poles and cuts .",
    "the solid line indicates on which sheets of the cut the other singularities are located .    denoting again as @xmath176 the point on the imaginary axis at which @xmath168 and @xmath121 , we have for this solution @xmath177 and @xmath178 . for smaller values of @xmath170 the pole moves towards the real axis but stays in the physical region .",
    "there are two further poles and cuts as indicated in the figure .",
    "these two poles are located on a straight line that goes through the origin .    in summary ,",
    "we have found in this section that the analytic structure of the solutions of the first class is similar to the analytic structure of a perturbative green function .",
    "for this class we find a pole and a cut on the real @xmath37-axis and no other singularities in the physical region . in the other two classes there are poles and cuts on the physical sheet .",
    "those solutions will in general not permit an interpretation in agreement with causality and unitarity and should therefore be regarded as unphysical solutions of gribov s equation .",
    "we did not find any hint for the existence of exceptional solutions in which those singularities move to the unphysical sheet for special initial conditions .",
    "we can thus conclude that , as anticipated in @xcite , there are no solutions of the equation without pion corrections which would lead to confined quarks .",
    "the subject of this paper has been gribov s equation for the green function of light quarks .",
    "we have have outlined how this equation is derived from the dyson  schwinger equation , and we have described how the approximations made in the derivation are motivated by the physical picture of supercritical color charges in qcd . in gribov s scenario the phenomenon of supercritical charges can occur in qcd due to the existence of very light quarks and is expected to cause chiral symmetry breaking and confinement . in the present paper we have concentrated on the equation proposed in @xcite which does not yet contain pion corrections .",
    "the equation describes the green function in feynman gauge .",
    "it collects the most singular contributions to the dyson ",
    "schwinger equation coming from the region of small momenta . at the same time it reproduces asymptotic freedom at large momenta .",
    "the derivation of the equation involves the assumption that the running coupling remains finite at small momentum scales .",
    "this is in agreement with recent phenomenological results obtained in the dispersive approach to power corrections in qcd .",
    "these analyses find a typical value of the coupling in the infrared which is above the critical value @xmath11 arising in gribov s scenario .",
    "gribov s differential equation for the light quark s green function is a nonlinear equation and so far only asymptotic expansions had been used to study it .",
    "we have described the corresponding results , especially the fixed point structure of the equation resulting from this analysis and the emergence of the critical value of the strong coupling .",
    "we have then performed a complete numerical study of the equation . after defining suitable models for the behaviour of the strong coupling constant in the infrared region",
    "we have classified the possible solutions of the equation according to their behaviour in the euclidean region of space  like momenta . at supercritical coupling",
    "the solutions change their behaviour and can oscillate while approaching the fixed points . the dynamical mass function of the quark has been computed in order to show that this change leads to the breaking of chiral symmetry at supercritical coupling .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking takes place independently of the details of the running coupling in the infrared as long as it is supercritical in some interval of the momentum .",
    "the breaking of chiral symmetry is connected with the occurrence of a series of phase transitions in the vacuum of light quarks .",
    "if the perturbative mass @xmath127 of the quark , i.e.  the mass defined at a large momentum scale , is below a critical mass then there are several solutions leading to different quark masses @xmath110 at low momentum scales , and in general @xmath110 does not vanish even in the limit of vanishing perturbative mass @xmath127 .",
    "we have determined the critical mass as a function of the coupling .",
    "it turns out to depend considerably on the mean value of the coupling in the infrared , but the dependence is weaker if the coupling is only slightly above the critical value . in agreement with the physical picture of supercritical color charges",
    "the phase transitions occur only for very small values of the perturbative quark mass .",
    "in @xcite it has been advocated that a confining green function in gribov s picture should be free of singularities in the physical region including time  like momenta .",
    "we have therefore studied the solutions of gribov s equation in the whole complex momentum plane .",
    "one class of solutions has an analytic structure similar to that of a perturbative green function , whereas the other two classes of solutions have singularities on the physical sheet .",
    "as anticipated in @xcite there are no solutions of the equation studied in the present paper exhibiting the structure required for confinement .    the phase transitions connected with the breaking of chiral symmetry lead to the generation of pions as goldstone bosons .",
    "their special properties in this approach @xcite indicate that they should be taken into account as elementary objects , and that the equation for the green function of the light quark should be modified accordingly .",
    "this modification @xcite is expected to change the behaviour of the solutions in the euclidean region only very little . in particular",
    ", the breaking of chiral symmetry will take place in a very similar way .",
    "but the pion corrections to the equation are expected to have significant effects on the analytic structure of the solutions . due to that it appears possible to find a confining green function .",
    "the next step should therefore be a numerical study of the corresponding differential equation .",
    "although the modified equation with pion corrections is more complicated it can be analysed using the same methods that have been used in the present paper .",
    "it would at a later stage also be interesting to investigate the effects of an additional scalar ( @xmath85-)meson which has been widely discussed in the literature in the context of meson spectra and of sigma models .",
    "we hope that the results of our analysis will be useful also for the more conventional approach to the dyson ",
    "schwinger equation for the quark .",
    "some general properties of the green function resulting from the dyson  schwinger equation appear to be rather universal and largely independent of the particular approximation scheme that is used .",
    "the analysis of the dyson  schwinger equation in quenched supercritical qed @xcite , for example , leads to a picture of phase transitions and chiral symmetry breaking that is very similar to the one resulting from gribov s equation .",
    "it would certainly be useful to identify such universal features of the green function and to achieve a better understanding of their origin . in this respect",
    "it is very important to consider different approximation schemes among which gribov s approach is certainly exceptional since it is motivated by the very interesting physical picture of supercritical charges .",
    "this work would not have been possible without numerous very instructive and motivating discussions with the late vladimir gribov .",
    "it is very sad that he passed away much too early .",
    "i missed his advice very much during the later stages of this work .",
    "i am most grateful to yuri dokshitzer for many very helpful discussions and for a careful reading of the manuscript , and to christian gawron for invaluable advice .",
    "i would like to thank bernard metsch , julia nyiri , herbert petry , dieter schtte , manfred stingl , bryan webber , and anthony williams for helpful discussions .",
    "i am grateful to the institut fr theoretische kernphysik of the university of bonn where part of this work was carried out .",
