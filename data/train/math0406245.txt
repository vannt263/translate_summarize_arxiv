    "the quadratic residue ( qr ) of an integer @xmath1 modulo @xmath0 is the remainder @xmath2 of the division of @xmath3 by @xmath0 .",
    "it is expressed by the congruence , @xmath4 where the residue class @xmath2 can be represented by an integer from 0 to @xmath5 .",
    "figure 1 shows a typical plot of qrs where a rather chaotic distribution can be appreciated .",
    "as @xmath1 and @xmath6 have the same qr , then only those qrs corresponding to @xmath7 are represented .",
    "it is not surprising that qrs modulo a big integer of unknown factorization are used in cryptography and random sequence generators @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they always show a remarkable presence of points that seem to draw multiple `` acute parabolas '' that spread along the graphic .",
    "a closer look confirms that the acute parabolas have a quite regular distribution , for values of @xmath1 near simple fractions of the modulus in a quantity related to the denominator of the fraction , so that a lower number of best defined acute parabolas correspond to a simpler fraction .",
    "not only qrs , but also @xmath8-power residues spread as integer points of sets of @xmath8-degree polynomials for @xmath1 values near a fraction of the modulus as it is stated in @xcite . in that paper , it was shown that some of those `` acute parabolas '' can be used to obtain low quadratic residues used in the factorization of large integers .",
    "in fact , those parabolas correspond to the montgomery polynomials of the mpqs ( _ multipolynomial quadratic sieve _ ) @xcite and hmpqs ( _ hypercube multipolynomial quadratic sieve _ ) @xcite factorization algorithms .",
    "a detailed treatment of the presence and regular disposition of the `` acute parabolas '' is done in section 2 .",
    "nevertheless , such features can be explained in a rather informal way with a fairly straightforward reasoning .",
    "let be an integer @xmath1 and a modulus @xmath0 and consider the difference between the square of @xmath1 and its nearby integers , i.e. @xmath9 , when @xmath1 is the closest integer to a fraction @xmath10 of the modulus .",
    "we consider small @xmath11 values and neglect the term @xmath12 .",
    "a second approximation is done replacing @xmath1 by @xmath13 , so @xmath14 . if @xmath15 is odd , the residue of the fraction @xmath16 modulo @xmath0 is another fraction @xmath17 with @xmath18 because @xmath19 for some integer @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath15 is even , we can note that @xmath21 with @xmath22 and its residue modulo @xmath0 is the fraction @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the qrs for values near @xmath1 are spaced approximately by multiples of @xmath25 .",
    "the term @xmath12 , which is not considered in this approximation , accounts for building the parabolas at regular intervals .",
    "functions involving qrs have been used to generate computer graphics .",
    "the function @xmath26 shows concentric circles with centres at coordinates that are made up of simple fractions of the modulus .",
    "they are actually , truncated paraboloids present in this bi - dimensional case ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "another type of patterns can be observed sometimes in qrs plots besides the `` acute parabolas '' .",
    "for some moduli , it may happen that the outlines of broader diffused `` ghost parabolas '' materialize , as can be observed in fig .  1 and fig .  3 .",
    "these kind of patterns are analyzed in section 3 .",
    "to conclude , we can state that the graphical patterns of qrs mod @xmath0 plots depend only on the residues of @xmath0 modulo the lower positive integers .",
    "the congruence relation is a relation of equivalence between integers .",
    "nevertheless , a similar relation between rationals can be established :    two rationals , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are q - congruent modulo an integer @xmath0 when @xmath29 is an integer and then we can write @xmath30 for some integer @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath31-congruence relation is reflexive , symmetric and transitive as well as the congruence relation between integers .",
    "moreover , two congruent integers are also @xmath31-congruent .",
    "therefore , the notation `` @xmath32 '' between rationals must be read as `` @xmath33 '' and when the relation is between integers , it can be read in both ways .",
    "let @xmath0 be a modulus and @xmath10 an irreducible fraction .",
    "we define the integer @xmath34 and its quadratic residue @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37 , that is , the nearest integer to @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath35 is the nearest integer to the rational @xmath38 where + @xmath39    we note that @xmath40 from the definition of the integer @xmath41 and then , @xmath42 with the definition of @xmath43 , the term @xmath44 becomes an integer . taking into account that @xmath45 , we can then write @xmath46    we now calculate the qrs of integers near @xmath34 . from the considerations explained in the introduction ,",
    "it becomes natural to consider lattice points defined by @xmath47 expanding the square of the trinomial , we have @xmath48 taking into account that @xmath40 and with @xmath49 and @xmath50 as the quadratic residues of @xmath1 and @xmath51 respectively , we can write @xmath52    the quadratic residues of integers near @xmath53 split as integer points of @xmath15 parabolas if @xmath15 is odd , or @xmath54 parabolas if @xmath15 is even , with their vertices placed at @xmath55 and equidistant in between .",
    "it is clear that ( [ r ] ) is a parabola under variable @xmath56 for each one of the @xmath57 values of @xmath11 in ( [ lattice ] ) .",
    "those parabolas will be named as @xmath58 .",
    "the coordinates at the vertex are given when the derivative of ( [ r ] ) with respect to @xmath56 becomes null .",
    "since @xmath50 is fixed for each @xmath11 value they are given by @xmath59 substituting the value of @xmath60 in ( [ lattice ] ) , and taking into account that @xmath61 , the coordinate at the vertex is @xmath55 which is independent from @xmath11 value .",
    "then , all parabolas related to the fraction @xmath10 have vertices at the same @xmath1 value .    since @xmath62 , then @xmath63 .",
    "replacing @xmath50 and simplifying we obtain , @xmath64 taking the value of @xmath35 from ( [ r_0 ] ) , we obtain , @xmath65 let be @xmath66 with @xmath67 as defined in ( [ r ] ) .",
    "then @xmath68 as much as @xmath11 runs over @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 takes all values in @xmath69 . from the above equation",
    ", it follows that vertices of @xmath58 lie exactly at multiples of @xmath72 and are separated by exact gaps of @xmath25 .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "propositions 1 and 2 give account of the number and position of the `` acute parabolas '' . near @xmath73 , @xmath15 parabolas ( or @xmath54 if @xmath15 is even )",
    "appear and all are equidistant in @xmath74 .",
    "figure 2 shows a representation in gray levels of the function @xmath75 .",
    "it is remarkable the symmetry of the graphic because it displays all the range of variables in @xmath76 .",
    "there is only one paraboloid at each node related to fractions 0/1 , 1/2 and 1/1 .",
    "that corresponds to centre , corner and the midpoint of the sides of fig .  2 .",
    "such paraboloids have a sharp profile form and they are surrounded by rings due to truncations .",
    "two paraboloids are present at each node related to 1/4 and 3/4 producing more fuzzy patterns . other patterns alike can be observed for more complex fractions .    at first glance ,",
    "when plots like fig .",
    "1 are observed , the presence of `` acute parabolas '' and their positions can be recognized . since @xmath77 , equation ( [ minimos ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath78 let @xmath79 , then @xmath80 for some integer @xmath27 .",
    "if the set of parabolas @xmath83 corresponding to the fraction @xmath10 is considered as a whole , without paying attention to the position of any single parabola in the set , the above equation shows that their position is defined only by the value of @xmath84 .",
    "proposition 1 shows that @xmath43 ( and also @xmath84 ) depends only on @xmath0 for each fraction @xmath10 .",
    "since the sets of parabolas corresponding to the simplest fractions are those that are relevant to the eye , it follows that the general appearance of a plot only depends on the values of @xmath85 for the lowest values of @xmath15 , that is for @xmath86 .",
    "let us consider the integer @xmath87 for example , let @xmath88 .",
    "plots of qrs modulo integers that are congruent modulo @xmath89 will have the parabolas corresponding to fractions with denominator equal or less than 9 in the same position . moreover , since @xmath90 divides @xmath89 for @xmath91 , the parabolas related to fractions with these denominators will also have the same position .",
    "as an example , figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) have the same appearance , but for their density , because the modules are @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively and then @xmath94 do not change when @xmath95 or @xmath91 . furthermore , we can prove that the vertices are rational points of a bundle of lines .",
    "let the integers @xmath89 , @xmath0 and @xmath27 be such that @xmath96 and let @xmath97 be the set of positive integers @xmath15 such that @xmath98 if @xmath15 is odd or @xmath99 if @xmath15 is even .",
    "the vertices of the parabolas defined in proposition 2 associated to fractions @xmath10 with @xmath100 are rational points of the bundle of lines of the form @xmath101    the relative position of the vertices depends on the value of @xmath43 mod @xmath90 as it was justified above .",
    "when @xmath15 is odd , @xmath102 and the expression of @xmath43 in proposition 1 can reduce to @xmath103 . if @xmath15 is even , @xmath104 .",
    "we put @xmath105 , for an integer @xmath20 such as @xmath106 .",
    "then , @xmath107 , that reduced to mod @xmath108 is also @xmath109 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath110 for any parity of @xmath15 .",
    "note that , from the definition of @xmath89 and @xmath27 , we have that when @xmath111 , @xmath112 and then @xmath113 . from proposition 2 and equation ( [ vertices ] ) , it follows that the vertices of the parabolas are at @xmath114 note that @xmath115 can always be solvable in @xmath8 for any value of @xmath116 and for any parity of @xmath15 .",
    "note also that @xmath8 can take any value with the appropriate value of @xmath116 .",
    "then , we have that @xmath117 for some @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath118 the bundle of quadratics degenerates in straight lines ( fig .",
    "3(c ) ) that are outlined due to the accumulation of points near the vertices . as @xmath27 has a higher absolute value , the straight lines bend into parabolas as can be seen in fig .  3 ( d ) and 3(e ) .",
    "when @xmath27 has absolute value as high as in fig  3(f ) , the lines of the bundle have such a high slope that they do not allow to notice the `` ghost parabolas '' .    to conclude , we have shown that proposition 1 , 2 and 3 explain the main visual features of qr plots and that those features are related solely with the residues of @xmath0 modulo the lower positive integers ."
