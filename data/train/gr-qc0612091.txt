    "massive black hole binaries ( mbhb ) are expected to be one of the strongest candidate sources for lisa , the laser interferometer space antenna , a joint esa - nasa mission that will search for gravitational waves ( gw ) is the frequency bandwidth @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "there is growing observational evidence for the existence of massive black holes ( mbh ) at the center of most galaxies .",
    "galactic formation models , such as hierarchical structure formation , suggest that modern day mbhs are the direct result of the coalescence of smaller `` seed '' black holes of @xmath1 throughout cosmic history  @xcite . observations also suggest direct evidence of a mbhb in the radio galaxy 0402 + 379  @xcite , at the center of the quasar 3c 345  @xcite . while there are other possible detections ,",
    "it is the system 0402 + 379 that seems to give the most compelling evidence of a mbhb .",
    "it is suggested that at the center of this system there are two mbhs with a combined total mass of @xmath2 and an orbital separation of 7.3 pc .",
    "the detection of mbhbs by lisa is important for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , it will allow us to carry out a test of gravity in the highly nonlinear strong - field regime  @xcite .",
    "secondly , it will allow us , in conjunction with other astronomical methods , to investigate such things as galaxy interactions and mergers out to very high redshift @xmath3 .",
    "these systems are also very attractive sources for lisa . due to their high masses , even as these systems approach merger and ringdown , they occur at frequencies which are blocked to the ground based detectors because of such things as tectonic motion below about 10 hz and more importantly , time varying gravitational potentials such as weather systems etc .",
    "also , unlike galactic binaries and extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) , the mbhbs are very clean sources with measureable signal to noise ratios ( snr ) of order @xmath4 s .",
    "while the actual event rate for mbhbs is still a subject of contention  @xcite , it is unlikely to be high enough to lead to confusion noise between sources , something which is very important in the search for galactic binaries and to a lesser extent in the search for emris .",
    "while a lot of work has been done on source modelling , especially for emri sources , there has not been much research done into developing viable detection algorithms for the lisa data analysis problem .",
    "one option would be to adopt the current ground based inspiral methods and use a template bank to search for each source .",
    "however , due to the high cost of templates involved for a blind template bank searching for a singe source ( @xmath5 for galactic binaries  @xcite , @xmath6 for non - spinning mbhbs  @xcite and @xmath7 for emris  @xcite ) other methods are needed . while there are currently other methods being developed , such as genetic algorithms  @xcite , iterative methods  @xcite , time - frequency methods  @xcite and tomographic reconstruction  @xcite , we present here a variant of the markov chain monte carlo method ( mcmc )  @xcite called metropolis - hastings monte carlo ( mhmc ) .",
    "the mcmc algorithm is a useful approach to searching through large parameter spaces , performing model comparisons , estimating instrument noise and providing error estimates .",
    "it has already been successfully been used in other astronomical fields such as cosmological parameter estimation with the wmap data  @xcite . in terms of gws ,",
    "the mcmc technique has already been applied to ground - based analysis  @xcite , a lisa toy - model problem  @xcite and galactic binaries  @xcite . for mbhbs both mcmc and mhmc techniques",
    "have been successfully applied  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will focus on the detection of gravitational waves from inspiralling schwarzschild bhs in the low frequency approximation . in the future we intend extending our work to include extra complications such as higher harmonic corrections to the amplitude , introducing spins and more complicated detector response functions to take into account lower mass systems .",
    "lisa is composed of a constellation of three drag - free spacecraft forming an equilateral triangle with each side of length @xmath8 km .",
    "the center of mass of the detector follows a heliocentric orbit @xmath9 behind the earth .",
    "the detector triangle is tilted by @xmath10 with respect to the ecliptic .",
    "due to orbits of each individual spacecraft being on different planes , the detector triangle rotates about itself with a period of 1 year .",
    "the detector itself is an all - sky detector .",
    "the lisa configuration allows us to use the three detector arms as a pair of two arm detectors .",
    "the motion of the detector around the sun introduces a periodic doppler shift whose magnitude and phase are dependent on the angular position of the source in the sky .",
    "while the full response from the detector involves issues such as fluctuations of arm - length , pointing ahead and signal cancellation once the wavelength of the gw becomes comparable to the armlength of lisa , we can make an excellent 1st approximation called the low frequency approximation ( lfa )  @xcite . by assuming that there are no fluctuations in arm length ,",
    "ignoring the problem of pointing ahead , ignoring signal cancellation due to the lisa transfer functions and assuming we can evaluate all three spacecraft at the same time , we can safely work in the lfa .",
    "also , as long as the frequency of the mbh is less than the transfer frequency of the detector , i.e. @xmath11 hz , the lfa is a good approximation to the total response from the detector .",
    "in fact it was shown that the lfa is a good approximation to the full detector response to a frequency of @xmath12 mhz  @xcite in this approximation the beam pattern functions are essentially a quadrupole antennae .",
    "working in the limit @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we can express the strain at the detector to an incoming gw with polarizations @xmath15 as @xmath16 where the phase shifted time parameter is @xmath17 here , @xmath18 500 secs is the radial distance to the detector guiding center , @xmath19 are the position angles of the source in the sky , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the lisa modulation frequency and @xmath22 gives the initial ecliptic longitude of the guiding center .",
    "the beam pattern functions are defined by f^+(t ) = , f^(t ) = .",
    "the quantity @xmath23 is the polarization angle of the wave .",
    "formally , if @xmath24 is the direction of the binary s orbital angular momentum and @xmath25 is the direction from the observer to the source ( such that the gws propagate in the @xmath26 direction ) , then @xmath23 fixes the orientation of the component of @xmath27 perpendicular to @xmath25 .",
    "the time dependent quantities @xmath28 are given in the lfa by  @xcite d^+(t ) = d^(t ) = , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 give the orientation of the two detectors .",
    "we can see from the above equations that we do not measure the polarizations individually at each detector , but a combination of the polarizations weighted by the beam pattern functions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend on previous works on the search for gws from a mbhb  @xcite using the lisa detector . in these previous works",
    "it was shown that it was possible to carry out not only a search for these sources , but also to map out the posterior distributions for the errors in the parameter estimation of the source .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : gw ] we define the gravitational waveform describing the inspiral phase of the two mbhs .",
    "we outline the division of the parameters into those extrinsic and intrinsic to the source .",
    "we then go on to define the restricted post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation and finally state the post - newtonian equations describing both the phase and frequency evolution of the waveform .",
    "in section  [ sec : da ] we outline the theory behind estimating both the source parameters and the errors in such an estimation .",
    "we briefly outline the geometric nature of the problem , before going on to outline the main tools behind our analysis .",
    "this will entail a definition of the f - statistic method and a discussion on the confusion noise from the galactic foreground .    in section  [ sec :",
    "method ] we present a discussion of metropolis - hastings sampling using simulated annealing .",
    "we will also present a new alternative method which we describe as frequency annealing .",
    "section  [ sec : results1 ] contains a presentation of the results from our analysis as we search for single sources in the data stream .",
    "because of the brightness of mbhbs , it is actually quite difficult to define an astrophysically reasonable low snr source in the case where we observe the coalescence of the mbhs . while it not hard to have galactic binaries with an snr of @xmath31 , to define mbhbs with snr of @xmath32 we have to assume that the time to coalescence is much greater than the time of observation . in a previous analysis  @xcite",
    ", we have found that it is quite trivial to find sources with snrs of @xmath33 100 .",
    "it is because of this that we have chosen sources with relatively low snr , covering various mass ranges from almost equal to a mass ratio of about 10 , with distances up to @xmath34 and with total mass ranges that show that it should be possible for lisa to see the coalescence of `` seed '' galaxies at cosmological distances . to make the problem more realistic",
    ", we also introduce a galactic foreground of approximately 26 million individually modelled galactic binary sources .",
    "this galactic foreground is generated using a modern population synthesis code  @xcite and a fast detector response code @xcite . at the end of this section",
    "we discuss the markov chain monte carlo method we use to analyze the posterior distributions .",
    "one of the important parts of this section is a discussion on how to compensate for the large correlations between the phase at coalescence and the other parameters when we explore the posteriors in the case where we do not see coalescence .",
    "section  [ sec : posteriors ] contains an analysis of the exploration of the posterior distribution functions for each of the parameters .",
    "we concentrate on the case where we do not see the coalescence of the waveform as this is the more challenging situation . in the case where coalescence is seen",
    ", the phase at coalescence is sufficiently resolved that it minimizes the correlations between the parameters .",
    "we have addressed this issue in a previous publication  @xcite .",
    "when we do not see the coalescence of the waveform , the phase at coalescence is virtually undetermined .",
    "we show from looking at a slice through the likelihood surface shows that the error ellipsoid is very long and narrowly peaked , like the blade of a knife .",
    "this is a problem for any mcmc exploration as most proposals will be rejected due to the fact that it is so difficult to stay on the knife edge .",
    "we propose a scheme where we maximize over the phase at coalescence and the luminosity distance and conduct our exploration in 7 dimensions only .    in section  [ sec : msmbh ]",
    "we examine the search when there are two mbhbs present in the data stream .",
    "we demonstrate that because of the small overlap between two mbhb sources that we can pull out each of the mbhbs individually with virtually no contamination to the rest of the data .",
    "our algorithm at present uses an iterative search for the mbhbs .",
    "the gravitational waveform from inspiralling bodies is composed of an inspiral , merger and ringdown phase . while we believe we have good knowledge of the inspiral and ringdown phases ,",
    "the merger phase is less well understood , though there has been great recent progress  @xcite . due to the recent progress in numerical relativity",
    ", it is hoped that some time in the near future we will be able to model the entire waveform . for now , we focus only on the initial inspiral phase . such an inspiral waveform is referred to as a chirp waveform due to the increase of amplitude and frequency caused by a slow decay in the orbit of the two component bodies .",
    "this decay is caused by the loss in energy and angular momentum from the system in the form of gws . in this analysis",
    ", we focus on mbhbs where the component bodies are schwarzschild mbhs . in this case",
    "the waveform is described by the nine parameter set @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the chirp mass , @xmath37 is the reduced - mass , @xmath38 are the sky location of the source , @xmath39 is the time - to - coalescence , @xmath40 is the inclination of the orbit of the binary , @xmath41 is the phase of the gw at coalescence , @xmath42 is the luminosity distance and @xmath23 is the polarization of the gw .",
    "we will describe the parameter subset @xmath43 as being extrinsic parameters , while all the rest will be described as being intrinsic , i.e. parameters that describe the dynamics of the binary .",
    "we should also mention that @xmath38 , which would normally be classed as being extrinsic , are classed as being intrinsic due to the fact that they are tied to the motion of lisa through the beam pattern functions .",
    "the gws are defined as a superposition of harmonics at multiples of the orbital phase .",
    "the two harmonics of the wave can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the harmonic index , @xmath46 is the orbital phase and @xmath47 are the amplitude corrections associated with each harmonic .",
    "the strongest harmonic of the wave is the one given by the quadrupole moment of the source , corresponding to @xmath48 . in the restricted post - newtonian approximation",
    "we neglect all other harmonics besides the quadrupole term in the amplitude , but expand the corrections in the phase of the wave up to n - pn order , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "we should point out that this approximation neglects the phase modulations introduced by the other amplitude corrections . in a future publication we will examine the consequences of searching for a signal with the full amplitude corrections using the restricted pn waveforms .",
    "for this study , we include corrections to the phase up to 2-pn order .    in the restricted post - newtonian approximation ,",
    "the gw polarizations are given by  @xcite @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the total mass of the binary , @xmath52 is the reduced mass ratio , @xmath53 is newton s constant and @xmath54 is the speed of light .",
    "the inclination of the orbit of the binary system is formally defined as @xmath55 .",
    "the invariant pn velocity parameter is defined by @xmath56 , where @xmath57\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the 2 pn order orbital frequency for a circular orbit formally defined as @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the gravitational wave phase which is defined as @xmath60.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the time dependent quantity @xmath61 is related to the time to coalescence of the wave , @xmath39 , by @xmath62 as they are used interchangeably in our analysis , the relationships between @xmath63 and @xmath64 are given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in table  [ tab : paramsandpriors ] we present the parameter values and the prior ranges for both mbhbs that we use in this analysis .",
    "we should point out that the individual masses quoted are the rest - frame masses , while the maximum gw frequency reached and the priors for the total mass are given in redshifted values .",
    "the priors were chosen to encompass an astrophysically interesting range , and also not tight enough as to make sure that the chain would definitely find the sources .",
    ".the parameter values and priors for the two test cases studied . in the above table ,",
    "both the maximum gravitational wave frequency and total mass priors quoted are redshifted values . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "one of the problems for the mcmc method is that very strong correlations between parameters , can be detrimental to good mixing of the chain . in the case where we do see the coalescence ,",
    "the correlations between the parameters is sufficiently mild that we can run a standard mcmc chain to explore the posterior distributions over the entire 9-@xmath67 parameter space  @xcite .",
    "however , the posterior exploration is more difficult prior to seeing the mbhb merger . in figure",
    "[ fig : loglslice ] we have plotted a @xmath68 slice through the likelihood surface for the case where do not see the coalescence of the mbhb .",
    "we see that there is an extremely narrow extended ridge on the log - likelihood surface .",
    "to properly understand what is going on , we need to imagine the image as being an unrolled cylinder .",
    "we can see that this ridge wraps itself around the cylinder multiple times . in order to explore the posterior distributions properly ,",
    "we need to travel up and down this ridge many times .",
    "in fact , the further we are out from coalescence , the greater the number of times the ellipsoid wraps itself around the cylinder .",
    "we can also see from the image the danger of either neglecting or fixing a constant value for @xmath41 .",
    "doing so would give incorrect errors for the other parameters as the chain will be confined to a small portion of the likelihood surface .    to explore this",
    "further we first ran a full 9-d search using a normal proposal distribution to try an map out the posterior distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the search was run for @xmath69 steps with an initial period of @xmath70 steps where the chain was run with a gentle simulated annealing with an initial heat of about 20 .",
    "this initial period is to allow the parameters to modify themselves slightly after the transition from a 5-d search to a 9-d exploration .",
    "we should note that if the starting parameter values in the mcmc are slightly away from the correct values ( i.e 10 s of sigmas ) , they _ will _ migrate to better values , but without the simulated annealing it just takes longer for this to happen . in figure  [ fig:9dpost ]",
    "we have plotted the marginalized pdfs against the prediction from the fim at the mean of the chain .",
    "the solid line in each cell denotes the correct value . in the cases where there is no solid line",
    ", this indicates that the chain has begun a random walk which has resulted in the mean of the chain being at a distance of @xmath71 from the correct answer .",
    "note that histograms have had the mean values subtracted and the values are then scaled by the square root of the variances from the chains .",
    "the markov chains used to produce these histograms had very high auto and cross correlations , and we estimated the chains would need to be hundreds of times longer to ensure convergence to the correct posterior distribution .",
    "this may explain the mismatch between the pdfs and the fisher matrix predictions , though it is also possible that the fisher matrix predictions are unreliable due to the low snr and the highly correlated source parameters .",
    "there are a number of methods that could be used to improve the mixing of the chains .",
    "one approach would be to use adaptive mcmc techniques such as delayed rejection , or pilot chains that produce rough maps of the pdf , which can then be used to fashion more effective proposal distributions .",
    "yet another approach is to observe that the search chains were little affected by the indeterminacy of @xmath72 since the f - statistic eliminates this parameter from the search . on the other hand , the f - statistic also eliminates three other parameters that might like to include in our pdfs .",
    "one way around this is to use a mini f - statistic that only eliminates two parameters , and thus allows us to implement a 7-d mcmc .",
    "the mini f - statistic can be derived by writing equation  [ eqn : strainfs ] in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 expanding out the detector response in terms of @xmath75 and @xmath41 we get @xmath76\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\sin(\\varphi_{c})}{d_{l}}\\left[a_{+}f^{+}\\sin(\\varphi)+a_{\\times}f^{\\times}\\cos(\\varphi)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on closer inspection we can see that the square bracket terms in the above expression correspond to the responses @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , with the luminosity distance set to unity .",
    "we can then write the mini f - statistic in the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 we then repeat the steps from the generalized f - statistic until we have the numerical values for the quantities @xmath82 .",
    "we then find the maximized values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 using @xmath83 @xmath84^{-1/2}.\\ ] ]    in figure  [ fig:7dpost ] we plot the posterior distributions for the case where we apply the mini f - statistic and search only over seven of the nine parameters .",
    "the resulting markov chains showed very little in the way of auto correlation , and the improved mixing yielded pdfs that are in good agreement with the fisher matrix predictions for the five intrinsic parameters .",
    "the fisher matrix predictions for the pdfs of the polarization and inclination angles are less accurate , but still reasonable .",
    "in this section we investigate the extraction of mbhbs when there is more than one system in the data stream .",
    "taking the two black hole binaries that we have already searched for individually , we injected both signals into the data stream .",
    "while the optimal method would be to search for both mbhbs at the same time , in this instance we carry out the search iteratively .",
    "our plan is to subtract each source we find from the data set before commencing the search for the next source .",
    "once again we use a frequency annealing method to extract the systems .",
    "while in practice one would use a global thermostated heat , our main objective here was to repeat the results of the individual searches when we had the two mbhbs present .",
    "therefore , we used the same thermostated heat factors for the individual sources in the two systems search as we did in the single mbhb search .",
    "the search for the two mbhbs was carried out multiple times with both frequency and simulated annealing methods , and in all cases the algorithm extracted the high snr source first . in none of our runs did the algorithm decide to go after the low snr source first . in figure  [ fig:2smbhsearch ]",
    "we present the search chains for the two mbhb search . once again",
    ", the initial search phase was run for 20,000 steps , with an additional freezing period of 10,000 steps to extract the mles for the parameter values .",
    "we can see from the search chains that there is almost no difference between the chains for the individual searches and the chains for the double mbhb search .",
    "we should not be very surprised by this as the normalized overlap between the two sources is just -0.0203 .",
    "the important question that has not been answered elsewhere is what effect will subtracting the mbhbs have on the galactic foreground . in figure",
    "[ fig : noiseres ] we plot the residuals of the noise , i.e. the difference between the original combination of instrumental and galactic foreground noise before the injection of the two mbhb sources , and the instrumental and galactic foreground noise after we have searched for and subtracted the two mbhbs .",
    "we can see from the plot that there is minimal contamination of the galactic binaries and instrument noise .",
    "this implies that we can safely extract the mbhb sources from the data without affecting the search for galactic binaries",
    ". this supposition is currently being tested in an upcoming publication .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new algorithm based on frequency annealing called metropolis - hastings monte carlo ( mhmc ) .",
    "we have introduced a galactic foreground of approximately 26 million individually modelled sources on top of instrument noise to give a realistic representation of the noise in the lisa output .",
    "we chose our sources so that in one instance coalescence was seen and in another it was not , in one instance the source was quite close and bright , and in the other the source was quite far away and dim .",
    "we demonstrated that both frequency and simulated annealing are successful in finding mbhbs in the lisa data stream even when no attempt is made to subtract the galactic foreground .",
    "the main advantage that frequency annealing has over simulated annealing is that it is a more robust search algorithm . in terms of real time analysis",
    "it finds the source faster than simulated annealing due to the fact that initially the sampling rates and array sizes are small .",
    "overall , the total runtime for the frequency annealing is also much shorter than the run time for simulated annealing allowing us to run many chains over again .",
    "once we have found the source , the next step is to map out the posterior distribution functions for the source parameters . due to the fact that the error ellipsoid in parameter space is so elongated and narrow ,",
    "it is very difficult to get a straightforward mcmc chain to carry out an exploration of the parameter pdfs with reasonable acceptance rates and mixing properties .",
    "this problem is amplified when we do not see the coalescence of the waveform .",
    "we showed that good mixing of the markov chains could be achieved by using a mini f - statistic that extremized over the phase at coalescence and the luminosity distance .    finally , we investigated the case where there were two mbhbs in the data stream at the same time . using an iterative frequency annealing search we extracted both black hole binaries .",
    "the extraction of each binary had no significant effect on the remaining binary nor on the noise in each detector channel .",
    "this work shows that lisa should be able to detect the inspiral of mbhbs out to the distant reaches of the universe .",
    "because of the nature of the source , we will also be able to detect multiple sources in the same data stream without effecting the galactic foreground .",
