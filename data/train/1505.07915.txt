    "the basics of non - stationary schemes for the record values are due to nevzorov ( 1985 , 1986 ) and pfeifer ( 1989 , 1991 ) , who considered the so - called @xmath22-scheme , that is the sequences of independent random variables with distribution @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a continuous cdf and @xmath25 s are positive parameters .",
