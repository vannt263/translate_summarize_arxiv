    "braneworld models of the universe  in which the observable universe is a four dimensional timelike hypersurface ( brane ) embedded in a higher dimensional ( bulk ) space - time  have attracted much recent attention .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that superstring / m - theory seems to require the existence of extra dimensions and the braneworld approach may be one way of reconciling our 3 + 1 dimensional universe with these higher dimensional theories @xcite .",
    "another reason for the current popularity of the braneworld construct is due to the fact that brane cosmology is usually accompanied by new features and is therefore , in principle , falsifiable @xcite .",
    "the simplest randall  sundrum ( rs ) braneworld , for instance , gives rise to an evolutionary equation for the brane which differs from standard general relativity at _ early times _",
    "this leads to several interesting consequences .",
    "for instance , the very early universe expands as @xmath5 , instead of the more familar @xmath6 in standard cosmology .",
    "the changed expansion rate causes a scalar field to experience greater damping , which , in turn , allows inflation to occur for a broader class of initial conditions and potentials @xcite .",
    "if the fifth dimension is timelike then the universe generically _ bounces _ and avoids the initial big bang singularity which plagues standard cosmology @xcite .",
    "( the behaviour of anisotropies in the rs scenario can also be very different from that in standard general relativity @xcite . )    a complementary approach to braneworld cosmology pioneered by the dgp model @xcite , allows the universe to accelerate at _ late times _ thus providing a geometrical answer to the riddle posed by dark energy .",
    "models which unify the rs and dgp approaches also lead to several new features @xcite .",
    "for instance ( i ) the phenomenon of dark energy can be transient so that the universe accelerates for a while before settling back into matter dominated expansion , ( ii ) the effective equation of state of dark energy can be _ phantom - like _",
    "( @xmath7 ) , ( iii ) new cosmological singularities can arise in such models @xcite .",
    "such alternative cosmological models provide reasonable fits to the current cosmological data @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the issue of cosmological evolution on a brane in a theory of gravity whose action includes , in addition to the familiar einstein term , a gauss  bonnet contribution .",
    "bonnet terms arise naturally in superstring theories @xcite and their cosmological effects have been discussed in several papers @xcite .",
    "the present paper deals with this issue in greater generality , we examine both cases : when the bulk dimension is spacelike as well as timelike . we also a develop a new pictorial method of analysis which provides qualitative insights into the evolution of the universe in this potentially important new model of gravity .",

    "our attempt in this paper has been to develop a completely general qualitative approach to determine the salient features of a brane embedded in a five dimensional bulk and evolving according to the precepts of einstein  gauss  bonnet gravity . for this purpose",
    "we show that the 3 + 1 dimensional equations of motion of several popular cosmological models can be depicted as simple curves in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "( here @xmath155 is the hubble parameter , @xmath2 the density and @xmath1 the brane tension . )    for instance , the spatially flat frw universe in gr has the form of a _",
    "quadratic curve _ while the randall - sundrum model describes a _ straight line _ in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the gauss  bonnet brane , on the other hand , describes a _ cubic curve _ in the @xmath199 plane  see equations ( [ eq : rs_bounce ] ) , ( [ eq : quadratic ] ) and ( [ cubic_curve ] ) .",
    "this _ pictorial depiction of dynamics _ permits us to discover the salient features of cosmic evolution very simply . applying this approach to the gauss ",
    "bonnet brane we discover the following interesting properties :    1 .   for a finite region in parameter space the gauss  bonnet brane _ accelerates _ at late times .",
    "acceleration can be _ phantom - like _",
    "( @xmath3 ) but does not lead to the eventual destruction of the universe in a _ big - rip _ future singularity . instead , at very late times the expansion of the universe approaches de  sitter space and becomes exponential (  @xmath158 ) .",
    "( the possibility that the current expansion of the universe may be phantom - like has evoked much recent interest and discussion ; see @xcite for a non - exhaustive list of papers discussing this issue and @xcite for a summary of recent observational results . ) 2 .",
    "the expansion of the universe may commence from or terminate in a ` sudden ' quiescent singularity , at which the hubble parameter and the density of matter remain finite but @xmath200 diverges .",
    "3 .   the universe can evade the initial big bang singularity and _ bounce_. ( this possibility is realized if the fifth dimension is timelike . )    whether any of these properties of the gauss  bonnet braneworld is realised in practice is currently an open question which can be answered by : ( i )  a deeper understanding of the embedding of this cosmology within a more fundamental theoretical framework , ( ii )  a comparison with observations .",
