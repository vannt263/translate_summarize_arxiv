    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is known to have three main regimes or phases : ( 1 ) the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) regime at high momentum transfers @xmath10 where the color force dynamics is weak and tends to zero for @xmath11 ; ( 2 ) the hadron regime at very low momentum transfers ( the far infrared ) where the color force has already grown so strong that the quarks and gluons are confined inside hadrons and cease to be the observable degrees of freedom of qcd dynamics .",
    "( 3 ) then there is the intermediate ( infrared ) momentum transfer regime we shall here denote by cqcd , where the quarks and gluons are still the primary physical degrees of freedom of the qcd dynamics , but have their coupling constant sufficiently large that all the qcd processes in this regime are nonperturbative .",
    "these nonperturbative processes include in particular chiral symmetry breaking and the confinement of quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "as conceived , the cqcd regime of qcd necessarily interfaces with the regime of applicability of chiral perturbative theories and effective lagrangians  @xcite of qcd , where nambu - goldstone bosons ( pions , kaons .. ) formed from nonperturbative chiral symmetry breaking , are explicitly highlighted as the effective degrees of freedom in terms of which to formulate effective lagrangians of qcd dynamics in this low energy region .",
    "the exact momentum scale points and critical couplings at which the cqcd regime sets in from the pqcd end , and later cuts off at the hadron end , are not known or measured , although a number of phenomenological studies particularly of chiral symmetry breaking , quark antiquark condensates , and quark confinement  @xcite , have placed some bench marks on the onset and cessation of this cqcd regime of quantum chromodynamics . additionally , recent heavy ion experiments at cern and brookhaven ( rhic ) , approaching the same cqcd regime of qcd from the hadron end ( at high temperatures ) , have confirmed the qualitative existence of this third phase of qcd called there quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase , and begun to yield some quantitative information on the points of onset of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration in high temperature qcd .",
    "finally , lattice quantum field theory simulations of qcd  @xcite have several hints of chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement phases in qcd , and have placed their own bench marks on the domain of the qgp intermediate phase of qcd .",
    "these known features of qcd , in particular the three phase structure of qcd , lead us to consider seriously the recent finding in our paper  @xcite , based on pad improved pqcd , that the same low energy region of qcd is governed by four component coupling constant solutions @xmath12 , ( with @xmath13 in which @xmath14 and @xmath15 account for any pole structure or else coupling constant freezing in the low energy region of qcd , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 provide a two scale cut off structure of pqcd from the npqcd infrared region .",
    "the possibility then arises that these two ir cut off scales @xmath16 and @xmath17 observed in our pad couplant qcd , may be identified as the onset points or boundaries of the cqcd regime of qcd , and in particular as the critical points of chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement in qcd .",
    "this possibility is what we examine in this paper , matching our observed two scale pad infrared npqcd coupling constant values and features @xmath18 , with various existing phenomenological bench marks and features of low energy qcd dynamics . because no such two scale infrared cut off structure has previously been observed or reported in perturbative qcd studies with renormalization group equations , in the infrared region , our work appears to us an interesting new finding .",
    "we present our study and results as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall some essential equations and features of our optimized @xmath19 $ ] pad qcd from our earlier paper  @xcite , noting in particular the observed two scale @xmath1 and @xmath2 infrared cut off structure in the flavor states @xmath0 of our optimized pad couplant qcd .",
    "because this earlier observation was based on the one physical observable or effective charge @xmath20 and its renormalization scheme invariant @xmath21 , we devote sections 3 and 4 of the paper , to considerations of what these pad couplant features look like , when other qcd physical observables , both timelike and spacelike , are used besides @xmath22 .",
    "satisfied that the two scale infrared cut off feature persists in all qcd physical observables , timelike and spacelike , we devote section 5 of the paper , to comparing this two scale feature with the known phenomenological results and bench marks of chiral symmetry breaking and confinement in qcd .",
    "prompted by the good agreement we found , we devote section 6 of the paper to a consideration of the flavor dependence of our infrared two scale structure and the implication of this for quark confinement in qcd .",
    "section 7 considers similar implication for the question of infrared fixed point in low flavor states of qcd .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief summary in section 8 .",
    "in our earlier paper  @xcite , we showed that the optimized @xmath19 $ ] pad improved pqcd couplant equation bifurcates into two independent @xmath7 and @xmath8 couplant equations given by    @xmath23    @xmath24    where : @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    and    @xmath28    here @xmath29 , is the optimized couplant solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : ndili1 ] ) or  ( [ eq : ndili2 ] ) , while @xmath30 is the corresponding qcd coupling constant .",
    "we shall from here onwards drop the bar over both quantities purely as a matter of notational convenience but it is understood that all our computations and plots below refer to @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "the quantities @xmath33 are perturbative qcd beta function coefficients having their usual values  @xcite : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36\\ ] ]    @xmath37 , where @xmath38    in the optimization process  @xcite , the coefficient @xmath39 as a variable satisfies a quadratic equation given by :    @xmath40    whose solutions are :    @xmath41    it follows from this that if the quantity @xmath42 is negative , @xmath43 is not real and our @xmath7 and @xmath8 equations have no real solutions unless we work with @xmath44 . since @xmath45 , this viability of of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : ndili54 ] ) depends in turn on the sign and magnitude of the renormalization scheme ( rs ) invariant @xmath21 .",
    "these rs invariants @xmath46 arise in general  @xcite from a consistency requirement between the pms / ech constraints on a perturbatively truncated generic physical observable    @xmath47    and the basic renormalization group equation ( rge ) for the couplant @xmath48 .",
    "explicitly , the rs invariants are given by :    @xmath49    @xmath50    or simply @xmath51    their explicit numerical values and sign then depend on the particular physical observable and its loop order coefficients @xmath52 we use in evaluating the rs invariants . in the particular case of the @xmath22 observable used in paper  @xcite , the @xmath21 values are large and negative and eqns  ( [ eq : ndili1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ndili2 ] ) have four crossing point solutions : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "our finding in  @xcite is that solutions @xmath14 and @xmath15 determine an infrared attractor pole behavior of pad qcd for @xmath0 , while the same @xmath55 solutions determine an infrared fixed point frozen couplant behavior for @xmath56 . on the other hand , the @xmath16 and @xmath17 solutions determine the points of cut off of pqcd from the infrared region . in the particular case of @xmath0 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 remain perturbative long after solutions @xmath14 and @xmath15 have turned away from the infrared region , shown typically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndili600 ] , the ultimate cut off points @xmath1 of @xmath16 and @xmath2 of @xmath17 can become phyically meaningful , being two possible scales of npqcd infrared dynamics that our pad couplant qcd predicts . in this respect , we found earlier in paper  @xcite that while @xmath16 cuts off typically at a critical momentum @xmath57 gev , the @xmath17 cuts off typically at @xmath58 mev , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ndili600a ] and  [ fig : ndili600b ] .",
    "the suggestion is that these two cut off points ( and their corresponding critical coupling constants ) may be marking the domain of cqcd , such that we can write : @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being point of onset of chiral symmetry breaking , while @xmath61 is the critical scale point of confinement and phase transition into hadrons .",
    "before however drawing this conclusion , we need to examine two points .",
    "the first is to determine that the above @xmath62 optimized pad two scale infrared couplant feature persists whatever the physical observable and its renormalization scheme invariants @xmath63 we use , particularly spacelike and timelike physical observables .",
    "the second point is to determine that our numerical values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from various physical observables and @xmath21 values , timelike and spacelike , agree with and are consistent with what one has come to expect from various existing phenomenological studies of chiral symmetry breaking and confinement in qcd .",
    "we now consider these two issues .",
    "as already indicated above , while optimization and the entire effective charge formalism  @xcite achieves the result of renormalization scheme ( rs ) independent perturbative qcd , the prize paid is that a qcd ( or pad qcd ) coupling constant becomes defined and tied to a particular physical observable and its renormalization scheme invariants @xmath65 if therefore we observe a particular feature of such optimized qcd ( or optimized pad qcd ) with respect to one physical observable and its rs invariants , we can not be sure that this feature is universal and holds for other physical observables and their respective rs invariants .",
    "this substitute ambiguity applies to any finding in these optimized qcds ( or optimized pad qcds ) , of couplant freezing as well as to the two scale @xmath62 infrared cut off structure discussed above .",
    "the closest we can go towards ameliorating the ambiguity is to compute an observed couplant feature using several different qcd observables , both timelike and spacelike , and to accept as reasonably valid and universal , only those couplant features that appear reasonably independent of any particular physical observable or effective charge used in computing them . to achieve this ,",
    "we first compute here the @xmath21 values of a number of spacelike and timelike qcd observables , whose perturbative coefficients @xmath66 are known , at least up to nnlo loop order .",

    "@xcite established the interesting point that there exists a critical value of qcd coupling constant , corresponding to the onset of chiral symmetry breaking , provided that ( a ) there is an infrared cutoff , realized phenomenologically as an effective gluon mass , and ( b ) there is an ultraviolet cutoff linked with a running coupling constant ( a chiral symmetric phase of qcd ) . within their own approximations to a fermion propagator schwinger - dyson equation , they find the critical qcd coupling constant for @xmath146 to have the value @xmath170 .",

    "he estimated the hierachy of the two scales to be : @xmath180 , and that their ratio is of the order 3 - 5 , meaning reciprocal ratios 0.33 - 0.20 .",

    "are believed to occur , nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl )  @xcite were the first to introduce a viable effective lagrangian model of hypothetical four fermion interactions , in which chiral symmetry breaking with pions as goldstone bosons , was fully realized .",
    "the qcd scale at which the model worked entered the njl effective lagrangian theory as an upper cut - off momentum and was explicitly found to be @xmath181 gev .",

    "what we now observe is that this njl model chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath181 gev , as well as the gap regime stretching to lower confinement scale , are exactly comparable with our finding from our pad plots that , @xmath183 , the implication of all this being that we identify our pad cqcd domain with the njl gap regime of goldstone physics .",
    "another striking phenomenological model buttressing our pad case is that of manohar and georgi  @xcite who not only found the phenomenological necessity for the two scale @xmath184 goldstone physics structure and an intermediate infrared qcd regime bounded by @xmath185 with @xmath186 , but actually proposed the use of the ratio of the two scales as a natural expansion parameter in chiral effective lagrangian theories of low energy qcd .",

    "this infrared gluon propagator behavior is normally taken as indicative of the point of onset of confinement in qcd .",

    "gogohia and magradze  @xcite used it to establish a close interrelatedness and juxtaposed existence in qcd of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , exactly as our pad qcd finds in figs .",

    "other recent studies  @xcite of the nonperturbative qcd vacuum , assumed dominated by a @xmath202 gluon propagator behavior , are found to exhibit a two scale structure of chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement dynamics , all strikingly similar to our pad infrared qcd findings reported here .",
    "finally iwasaki and co - workers  @xcite found from their lattice qcd studies that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement in infrared qcd must be closely related or correlated , even when they found no evidence that the two phenomena necessarily occur simultaneously . the implication for scale considerations , is that the two phenomena are compatible with being intrinsic two scale structure or sequential phenomena of infrared qcd dynamics , exactly as we find here with infrared pad qcd .",
    "what is more , iwasaki et .",
    "al . found that their two scales and phenomena of infrared qcd , depend on the flavor number @xmath91 of the qcd system , again exactly as our tables  [ tab : ndili5 ] and  [ tab : ndili6 ] , and our various pad qcd plots , explicitly show .    clearly , these varied physical qcd phenomenological results concerning infrared qcd dynamics and its critical boundary points , all consistently close to and in agreement with the pad qcd findings shown variously in figs .",

    "[ fig : ndili605 ] to  [ fig : ndili600c ] , as well as tables  [ tab : ndili5 ] and  [ tab : ndili6 ] , compel us to admit the pad infrared @xmath18 structures as relating to physical qcd . in that case",
    ", we can make a number of important deductions from our work , concerning infrared dynamics of physical qcd as follows .",
    "one immediate deduction or proposal we can make following from the above , is that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd are caused by two distinct component color forces or dynamics of qcd . of our two nonperturbative infrared couplant forces @xmath8 and @xmath7 , the latter is responsible for and identifiable with the onset and dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , while the former @xmath8 is responsible for quark confinement in qcd .",
    "following from the fact that the two component color forces are independent solutions @xmath16 and @xmath17 of our pad couplant equation , we assert as part of our finding , that the two nonperturbative infrared qcd phenomena , chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement , are actually distinct physical phenomena .",
    "they may however still be closely related in the sense that one phenomenon provides a stimulus or background that facilitates the occurrence of the other phenomenon .",
    "the indication from our plots is that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking @xmath145 occurs first at the higher infrared nonperturbative scale @xmath1 , phenomenologically flooding the qcd vacuum with @xmath205 pair condensates , which in turn provide a superconducting state of qcd vacuum , compatible with quark confinement in the manner advocated by a number of workers  @xcite .",
    "however , what our work now indicates is that confinement itself does not actually occur ( even after a @xmath146 ) until the independent @xmath8 confinement causing color force has attained its own confinement scale at @xmath206 .",
    "in such a scenario , the possibility arises that if these two scales are very far apart , the condensate background effect caused by @xmath7 at scale @xmath1 may become dissipated or ineffective by the time we reach the @xmath8 confining scale at @xmath2 . then confinement does not occur even though we are at scale @xmath2 .",
    "the details of this confinement mechanism do not concern us here .",
    "what we show now is that our work provides a strong evidence or indication that the above interrelatedness or correlation of confinement with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking does exist in concrete terms in qcd .",
    "here we return to table  [ tab : ndili5 ] and  [ tab : ndili6 ] where we already computed the ratios @xmath3 as a measure of how close together or far apart the two nonperturbative infrared scales are .",
    "we now plot this @xmath3 correlation factor as a function of flavor number and for different spacelike and timelike observables .",
    "the plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndili610 ] , and reveal some interesting features .",
    "we observe that in the spacelike cases the correlation ratio first rises with increasing flavor number from @xmath5 , and reaches a peak at @xmath4 or in the region @xmath207 .",
    "it then falls off rapidly for all @xmath9 and is practically zero near @xmath208 .",
    "it is well known in nature , that the most stable hadrons and confined quark states are the @xmath209 or @xmath4 states of qcd .",
    "these are the nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) . @xmath119",
    "confined quark states exist as higher baryon states that are only quasi stable .",
    "there are no known stable or quasi stable confined quark states of flavor number @xmath9 .",
    "our fig .",
    "[ fig : ndili610 ] appears therefore to be providing us a strikingly direct explanation and insight into the origin of this well known state of affairs in nature , attributing it to an interplay or some intrinsic interrelatedness of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement mechanism in qcd .    in the case of the timelike @xmath10 cases shown also in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndili610 ] , the correlation factor falls off progressively from @xmath5 to @xmath141 , in a manner to suggest that the most readily confined qcd states are the pure gluonic states or glue balls , rather than the @xmath210 states .",
    "this would appear not to be so in nature but we are not able at the moment to reconcile this crucial difference in the timelike and spacelike behaviors of fig .  [",
    "fig : ndili610 ] , except that the difference is directly traceable to @xmath21 being positive or negative in the manner shown in table  [ tab : ndili1 ] .",
    "apart from this difference in their @xmath117 behavior , the timelike and spacelike observables are fully in agreement from their correlation plots shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ndili610 ] , that confinement becomes rapidly less probable for @xmath9 , and that this decline arises from the intrinsic confinement scale @xmath2 becoming progressively less correlated with the intrinsic dynamical chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath1 of qcd .",
    "we remark that iwasaki and co - workers  @xcite actually found in their lattice qcd studies , that confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking cease to occur for @xmath211 , but occur only for @xmath198 . our work and fig .",
    "[ fig : ndili610 ] explain adequately what iwasaki and co - workers observed in their lattice qcd studies , and this close agreement between their work and ours , leads us once more to affirm that our pad infrared qcd results have a physical reality , reproducing quite well infrared qcd dynamics from a wide variety of phenomenological considerations , including lattice qcd simulations .",
    "a second deduction for qcd we can make from our pad plots and features , is that while many of the phenomenological models we cited earlier in this paper , especially those dealing with ladder approximant schwinger - dyson equations , make mere guesses or assumptions about the form of the qcd coupling constant inside the cqcd regime , @xmath212 , some authors parameterizing it by a frozen coupling constant or a step function :    @xmath213    with + @xmath214 or in the form : @xmath215    where @xmath216 is some constant parameter identifiable with our @xmath149 , our pad model shows explicitly  @xcite that the @xmath0 flavor states are not infrared couplant freezing states of qcd .",
    "rather the two coupling constant solutions @xmath16 and @xmath17 that govern qcd dynamics in this cqcd infrared regime of qcd are together growing infinitely large in the domain .",
    "such infinitely growing coupling constant in the infrared region of qcd , is what is naturally needed to explain physical confinement of colored quarks and gluons into hadrons . therefore , our optimized pad qcd has this additional positive side to it that it offers a more natural explanation of the origin and mechanism of quark confinement than some of the phenomenological models we cited in section 5 .",
    "indeed the @xmath202 enhanced infrared singularity structure of the gluon propagator , currently gaining ground  @xcite as a necessary ingredient to reconcile qcd vacuum with quark confinement , the linearly rising inter - quark potential law , and other nonperturbative features of infrared qcd , has no place for an infrared fixed point in low flavor states of qcd .",
    "the same conclusion that low flavored states of qcd do not manifest any infrared stable fixed point is found in several other places refs .",
    "@xcite to  @xcite , all rather contrary to refs .",
    "summarizing , we state that the two scale cut off momentum structure exhibited in the infrared region of qcd by our optimized pad couplant eqns .",
    "( [ eq : ndili1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ndili2 ] ) , is identifiable as marking the points of onset of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement respectively , in infrared qcd .",
    "taking these two infrared nonperturbative phenomena of qcd as characteristically marking the beginning phase and end phase respectively , of the cqcd regime of qcd , we can conclude , based on extensive correlations of our results with a wide range of known phenomenological studies of low energy qcd , that our work actually constitutes a finding from within perturbative qcd approaches , of a previously unknown but long speculated infrared qcd window , marked at its two ends by a critical coupling constant and a critical momentum , and separating qcd dynamics in the cold ( zero temperature vacuum state ) , into the three distinct phases of purely hadronic qcd at very low momentum transfers q , a largely weak perturbative qcd phase at high q , and finally an intermediate phase or regime of strongly coupled yet quark - gluon dominated qcd dynamics .    traditionally in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , one believes that an impenetrable wall at @xmath217 shuts out nonperturbative qcd and hadron physics from any view or access from the pqcd end .",
    "this apart , it is held that much of pqcd remains accessible in the domain stretch from the far ultraviolet ( uv ) qcd , until close to the landau cut off wall at @xmath217 .",
    "what our work shows is that while the landau wall at @xmath218 remains impenetrable from the pqcd end , much of the most important aspects of nonperturbative qcd dynamics including spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the confinement of quarks into hadrons , actually lies in a buffer zone ( cqcd ) that leads up from the far uv qcd to the landau wall . beyond the landau wall lies pure hadron physics , and our work provides explicit boundary values both in critical momentum and critical qcd coupling constant , separating these three phases of qcd , as delineated from the pqcd beta function parameters and renormalization group equations of a running qcd coupling constant .",
    "we believe the same cqcd buffer zone just delineated , is what is currently being observed as quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) from the hadron end at high temperature ( non - vacuum qcd state ) , in heavy ion experiments at cern and brookhaven ( rhic ) . as such",
    ", it becomes immediately possible to ask how the domain boundaries and dynamical characteristics of this intermediate cqcd / qgp phase of qcd get modified or shifted at two widely separated temperatures and energy density , represented by the heavy ion experiments on the one hand , and our zero temperature vacuum qcd studies on the other hand .",
    "this comparison will await further developments and evolution in the qgp plasma experiments and the various lattice and phenomenological computations relating thereto .",
    "focusing on our own boundary values of the cqcd regime computed here at zero temperature , we found that these values in general vary with flavor as seen from tables  [ tab : ndili5 ] and  [ tab : ndili6 ] , and from our various figures and plots .",
    "we have interpreted this @xmath219 flavor behavior to be a maifestation of a phenomenologically known fact that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement are closely related infrared qcd phenomena .",
    "our specific finding is that the more widely separated their set scales are , the less likely the corresponding flavor state of qcd will be a quark confinement state .",
    "we actually found evidence from our fig .",
    "[ fig : ndili610 ] that quark confinement occurs mainly in the low flavor states @xmath117 , with a peak at @xmath4 , but becomes progressively non - existent or improbable in the higher flavor states @xmath220 .",
    "it turns out that this is actually what one finds in nature .",
    "after we had completed this work , our attention was drawn to a preprint by elias and co - workers  @xcite in which they used their own method of denominator versus numerator zeros of pad qcd beta function , to estimate the location and scale value of the point where perturbative qcd cuts off from the infrared region .",
    "they found only one scale cut - off point at a critical momentum @xmath221 gev .",
    "this is in contrast to our two scale cut off structure presented variously in this paper , and anticipated in the several phenomenological models we cited in section 5 of this paper .",
    "we make two comments in relation to this work of elias et .",
    "the first is that the method of denominator versus numerator zero of pad beta function appears not adequate to reveal the multicomponent couplant solutions of pad qcd and consequently the two scale infrared structure .",
    "this fact was already highlighted in our earlier paper  @xcite .",
    "one needs to work with effective charges and renormalization group invariants or optimized pad qcd .",
    "the second comment we make is one of noting that the one scale cut off found by elias et .",
    "al . at @xmath221 gev , is comparable to our chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath222 gev . since elias et .",
    "al . worked with the higher pad approximants @xmath223 , [ 1|2 ] , [ 3|1 ] , [ 1|3 ] , [ 2|2]$ ] , as against our @xmath19 $ ] pad approximant , the close agreement between our onset scale and theirs , provides a good indication that our results and features presented here will hold irrespective of the particular pad approximant used , exactly as we already inferred in paper  @xcite .",
    "one could of course repeat directly the various computations reported in this paper , using this time , these higher pad approximants to verify that the results remain robust .",
    "the draw back is that the higher renormalization scheme invariants @xmath224 needed for such computations , are not presently known or computed perturbatively for the various qcd physical observables reported in this paper . +",
