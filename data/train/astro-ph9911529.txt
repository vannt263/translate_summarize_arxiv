    "polars , or am her systems , a subset of magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , are a unique class of cvs . as with the typical cv",
    ", polars contain a white dwarf which accretes matter from a roche lobe - filling low - mass secondary star .",
    "however , unlike a typical cv , the white dwarf in a polar has a magnetic field strength on the order of a few tens of megagauss ( mg ) .",
    "these strong magnetic fields cause the disruption of the accreted material that would otherwise form an accretion disk . instead , material transfer is routed on to the white dwarf in the form of an accretion stream which follows the path of one or more of the magnetic field lines to impact the surface at one or both of the magnetic poles . as the material approaches the white dwarf ,",
    "a shock front is created where impact energy is released in the form of extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and x - ray photons .",
    "surface heating , of up to a few hundred thousand degrees kelvin , and possible penetration of the surface by material blobs completes the accretion region production of high energy flux .",
    "@xcite presents a detailed review of polars .",
    "since the accretion regions in polars are the site of the majority of high energy emission , we would expect that euv and x - ray observations would provide a wealth of information about their accretion geometry .",
    "this is indeed the case as shown , for example , by @xcite .",
    "differentiation and study of eclipses of the accretion region by the secondary , the far and near accretion stream , and the white dwarf ( a self - eclipse ; when the rotation of the cv system causes the accretion pole to pass behind the limb of the white dwarf ) , allows a number of system parameters to be determined .",
    "these include the inclination of the system , the position of the accretion pole on the white dwarf , and if the white dwarf is accreting at one or both of its magnetic poles .",
    "with this type of study in mind , one of us ( sbh ) placed qq  vul on the target list of the _ euve _ satellite right angle program @xcite .",
    "serendipitously discovered in a survey of soft x - ray sources @xcite , qq  vulpeculae was confirmed as an am her binary through detection of circular and linear polarization @xcite .",
    "qq  vul has a relatively long orbital period for a polar , @xmath2 min @xcite , and although the strength of the magnetic field has not been directly measured , it is assumed to be fairly typical , @xmath3 mg @xcite .",
    "blackbody fits to the spectrum of qq  vul yield a temperature of @xmath4 k for the x - ray heated accretion regions @xcite .",
    "mass estimates of m@xmath5=0.58m@xmath6 and m@xmath7=0.35m@xmath6 have been determined for qq  vul by @xcite .",
    "the initial multi - wavelength observations of qq  vul @xcite were able to place some constraints on the system geometry .",
    "these observations suggested a system with a magnetic pole tilted @xmath8 from our line of sight during the linear polarization pulse peak , an orbital inclination of @xmath9 , and a stellar latitude of the accreting magnetic pole in the range @xmath10 .",
    "circular and linear polarization observations @xcite have revealed a weak and diffuse linear polarization pulse centered on maximum light , indicating that the near field accretion column is always in sight , although the pole does graze the limb during a self - eclipse @xcite .",
    "the polarization data also suggest that there is non - radial accretion flow @xcite implying a  kink \" in the accretion stream which flows to the magnetic pole .    throughout its history of observations , qq  vul",
    "has repeatedly shown a complex and varying x - ray light curve .",
    "studies undertaken with the use of _ einstein _",
    "@xcite , _ rosat _",
    "@xcite , and _ exosat _ @xcite have all shown the complexities apparent in the x - ray component of qq  vul .",
    "@xcite found that the soft x - ray count rate had doubled within a period of two years and that the shape of the light curve they observed was indeed quite different from the initial x - ray light curve of qq  vul @xcite .",
    "figure 1 in @xcite provides a comparison of the different x - ray light curves previously obtained for qq  vul .",
    "there has been conflicting evidence for whether or not qq  vul possesses two accreting poles .",
    "while the double peaked nature of the soft x - ray light curves of @xcite might lead one to interpret it as two - pole accretion , it is noted there that the second pole is not evident in the optical light curve .",
    "other observations @xcite detected soft x - ray spectral variations as a function of orbital phase which could be modeled by an extended multi - temperature accreting region or by two accreting poles with slightly different temperatures",
    ". however , all of these previous observations do agree that if two - pole accretion is taking place , the primary accreting pole is a weaker source in soft x - rays .",
    "recent polarization data seem to strongly suggest that qq  vul is undergoing two - pole accretion .",
    "optical polarization data from @xcite can not be explained by one - pole accretion and a second linear polarization peak , seen in the data of @xcite , requires a second accreting region to be in view at certain binary phases .",
    "the euv photometric data were obtained with the _ euve _ satellite using the right - angle pointing scanner telescopes a and b. scanner a imaged qq  vul through a lexan / boron filter ( @xmath11 ) , sensitive in the bandpass @xmath12 while scanner b data were obtained in an al / ti / c filter ( @xmath13 ) , sensitive in the bandpass @xmath14 .",
    "details of the photometric properties of the imaging telescopes on board the _ euve _ may be found in @xcite .",
    "our observations of qq vul began on 1996 aug 11 ( gmt ) and continued through 1996 aug 16 ( gmt ) , spanning @xmath15s , or a total of @xmath16 .",
    "the data were passed through _ euve _ standard processing and delivered to us in compressed format on cd - rom .",
    "we then extracted the scanner observations using the standard _",
    "data analysis software packages within iraf .",
    "photometry was performed using an aperture with a seven pixel radius centered on the coordinates of the source and a background annulus having a radius of twenty pixels also centered on the object . due to the large difference in signal - to - noise obtained in the two data sets ,",
    "every 100 data points ( photon events ) were binned together for the raw data from scanner a , and every 30 data points were binned together for the raw data from scanner b. an idl program ( written by m. sirk ) was then used to produce light curve data files that were phased according to the ephemeris of the inferior conjunction of the secondary star in qq  vul , hjd 2448446.4710(5 ) + 0.15452011(11)e @xcite .",
    "finally , our resultant light curves , in both scanner a ( lexan / b ) and scanner b ( al / ti / c ) , were rebinned to 0.005 in phase .",
    "figures [ sca_lcurve ] and [ scb_lcurve ] present our obtained _ euve _ light curves phased on the @xcite ephemeris . convolving the mean euv count rate of 0.01 counts / second with the effective area as a function of wavelength for the lexan / b filter @xcite , we find that the observed euv flux is @xmath17 ergs@xmath18s@xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "it is interesting to note that scanner b , viewing qq  vul through the al / ti / c filter , detected anything at all . at a wavelength of @xmath21 , and a hydrogen column density of @xmath22 @xcite for a distance to qq  vul of 215 pc @xcite , the optical depth is @xmath23 . at such a large optical depth",
    ", the ism transmission of photons from qq  vul at this wavelength is essentially zero .",
    "we would therefore not expect to detect photons through this filter and indeed no other polar has been detected by _",
    "euve _ in scanner b at these wavelengths . however , the al / ti / c filter is known to have an x - ray leak peaking near 44@xmath24 @xcite , and we conclude that the data collected here with scanner b is an x - ray light curve for qq  vul with a mean effective wavelength of @xmath2544@xmath26 .",
    "we note that this is not the first detection of an x - ray leak with the al / ti / c filter ; x - ray leaks were also reported in",
    "observations of the nova v1974 cygni @xcite .",
    "one flaw in our conclusion concerning the x - ray light curve would be if qq  vul were actually quite close by in space , say less than 50 pc .",
    "we therefore independently re - determined the distance to qq vul using bailey s method @xcite and newly obtained infrared observations .",
    "bailey s method relies on the relationship between certain physical parameters of the secondary star in the cv system and the distance to that system .",
    "the relation is : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance , @xmath29 is the @xmath29-band magnitude of the secondary star , @xmath30 is the @xmath29-band surface brightness of the secondary , and @xmath31 is the radius of the secondary star .    using data kindly obtained by m. huber with the wyoming infrared observatory on 1998 aug 30 ut ( 9:30 hours ) , we find that qq  vul had a @xmath29 magnitude of 14.0@xmath320.1 mag .",
    "taking @xmath33 @xcite , and @xmath34 @xcite , the distance to qq vul is determined to be @xmath35 pc ; a value which is in agreement with earlier measurements which suggest a lower limit of @xmath36 pc @xcite . @xmath37 and @xmath38 observations of qq  vul by @xcite detected a visual  companion star \" to qq  vul with @xmath39 ( obtained using @xmath40 colors derived for @xmath29 spectral type stars ) .",
    "if possible contamination from this star in the infrared ( i.e. , @xmath29 band ) is taken into consideration , qq  vul would be even farther away .",
    "therefore , it seems highly unlikely that the detected signal in scanner b is due to @xmath14 photons but is instead the aforementioned x - ray leak .",
    "the effective bandpass of the x - ray leak in the al / ti / c filter is roughly triangular in shape and covers the range of @xmath41 .",
    "the peak throughput , at 68@xmath26 , is @xmath422% of the normal filter transmission near 171@xmath26 and has zero sensitivity to photons with a wavelength below @xmath43 @xcite . using the effective area ratio of the lexan / b filter to the al / ti / c filter @xcite , and the fact discussed above concerning the total absence of long wavelength photons",
    ", we can determine that the x - rays observed for qq  vul have wavelengths from @xmath44 , with a mean effective central wavelength near 44@xmath26 . performing an approximate integration under the triangular bandpass and convolving it with the effective area as a function of wavelength , we find the observed x - ray flux to be @xmath45 ergs@xmath18s@xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "x - ray fluxes ranging from @xmath46 ergs@xmath18s@xmath19@xmath20 @xcite to @xmath47 ergs@xmath18s@xmath19@xmath20 @xcite have been reported in previous studies , which , along with the value determined here , reflect the variability of the source .",
    "we have thus obtained simultaneous time - resolved photometric data in the x - ray ( @xmath48 ) ( figure  [ scb_lcurve ] ) and euv ( @xmath49 ) ( figure  [ sca_lcurve ] ) wavelength regions which allow us to make a direct comparison of the emitting character of this system in these two wavelength regimes .",
    "the euv and x - ray light curves , figures [ sca_lcurve ] and [ scb_lcurve ] respectively , both show a double peak shape with minima occurring near phase 0.2 and phase 0.85 and maxima at phases 0.0 and 0.45 .",
    "while each light curve reveals similar gross features , we note that there is far less change and detail in the euv data",
    ". this could be due to the fact that qq  vul has a broader , more diffuse euv emitting region but a smaller , better defined x - ray emitting region .",
    "the modulations of both light curves are uneven in their minima and maxima . the minima alternate between a deep , essentially complete eclipse at phase 0.85 to a less deep and well - defined dip near phase 0.2 , while the maxima shift between a narrow peaked one near phase 0.0 to a brighter , broader one covering about 0.4 in phase , centered at 0.45 . the two maxima , while showing that the secondary pole is stronger in intensity , are probably nearly equal in phase extent and overall shape , the narrower one being  cut - off \" around phase 0.9 by an eclipse of the magnetic pole accretion region by the near - field accretion stream @xcite",
    "interpreted as a two - pole accretor , the locations of the two poles would have centers near binary phases 0.1 and 0.55 , that is , almost directly along the line of centers of the binary .",
    "the eclipse by the near - field stream of the accretion region facing the secondary star occurs before phase 0 as is the case in most polars @xcite .",
    "the magnetic pole on the far side of the white dwarf suffers no eclipse , thus , it is visible in phase for approximately one - half of the orbital period , and its shape is consistent with a spot latitude of @xmath50 @xcite given a binary inclination of @xmath51 ( see below ) .",
    "figure [ zoom ] is a close - up of the x - ray light curve minimum near phase 0.8 .",
    "it appears that this minima has two components .",
    "the first half of the broad dip , starting at phase 0.7 , has a slow decline up to phase 0.85 and is likely to be the result of an eclipse by the near - field accretion stream .",
    "the remaining part of this dip shows an abrupt drop to near zero counts and appears to be flat bottomed from phase 0.85 to 0.92 , with the most likely cause being a stellar eclipse of the x - ray emitting region by the secondary star .",
    "if true , this constrains the system inclination to be greater than @xmath52 .",
    "an interesting feature appearing in the x - ray light curve ( figures [ scb_lcurve ] and [ zoom ] ) , but not seen in the euv light curve , is the narrow dip which occurs at phase 0.96 .",
    "using other polar light curves as a guide , this narrow dip feature is likely to correspond to an eclipse of the accretion region by the far - field accretion stream .",
    "it may also be present in the euv data but the noise level precludes its discovery . while unresolved , the short duration of this narrow feature ( 0.015 in phase or 3 min ) provides strong evidence for the compactness of the hard x - ray emitting region in qq  vul . translating this time in to a size on the white dwarf surface ( without correction for latitude and assuming r@xmath53 = 7000 km ) we find an emitting region diameter of 660 km or , if circular , @xmath54=0.002 .",
    "taking the gross ratio of the low euv count rate to the higher x - ray count rate ( even as a leaked signal ) one could conclude that the magnetic field strength in qq  vul is relatively low , possibly less than 10 - 30 mg @xcite .",
    "however , while in general a large x - ray to euv ratio indicates a lower magnetic field strength in polars , this is not always the case with the difference attributed to the structure and size of the accretion region @xcite .",
    "figure [ hratio ] presents the hardness ratio ( x - ray / euv ) for qq  vul . due to the low value of the flux in the euv light curve ,",
    "both the x - ray and euv light curves were re - binned to 0.05 in phase , thereby allowing the hardness ratio to not be dominated by noise spikes due to the low euv flux values .",
    "figure [ hratio ] exhibits an increased hardness near phase 0.25 , with a sharp rise near phase 0.3 .",
    "this peak might indicate the emergence of the second accreting pole .",
    "a comparison of our qq  vul x - ray light curve with previous high energy observations shows that the continuous orbital variations and temporal changes , noted by @xcite , appear to be persistent .",
    "some similarities , however , do exist between our x - ray light curve and the 1983 oct and 1985 jun _ exosat _ light curves discussed in @xcite .",
    "for example , the unequal minima and maxima and even the presence of a narrow dip , probably due to an eclipse of the accretion region by the far - field accretion stream .",
    "this narrow dip feature occurs near phase 0.03 in the 1983 oct _",
    "exosat _ light curve and 0.08 in the 1985 jun _ exosat _ light curve , compared with phase 0.96 seen in our light curve [ according to the ephemeris of @xcite ] .",
    "the 1985 sep _ exosat _",
    "light curve @xcite , is very different from our present data as it exhibits a much different shape with nearly equal maxima and yet again a narrow dip but one which appears at yet another phase ( phase 0.71 ) within the light curve .",
    "the fact that the narrow dip is always present but changes phase indicates a movement , within the binary , of the far - field accretion stream similar to that observed in hu aqr @xcite .",
