    "abundance ratios such as [ @xmath3/fe ] , where examples of @xmath3elements are o , mg , si , ca , ti , provide powerful constraints on how much of the galactic halo could have been formed in dsph - sized fragments because halo stars have [ @xmath3/fe ] that is independent of metallicity and approximately equal to the theoretical average yield of type ii supernovae ( sne ) .",

    "this discrepancy is understandable because of the degeneracy of age and metallicity in color - magnitude diagrams .",

    "the spread in [ fe / h ] and age of sgr dsph stars indicates that star formation and chemical enrichment was prolonged , with a possible gap between metal - rich and metal - poor populations",
    ". it would be interesting to obtain high dispersion spectra of stars in ter 7 , the cluster inferred to be @xmath40 gyr younger than the other globular clusters , as well as additional intermediate - aged and older field stars to flesh out the age - metallicity relationship . in figure [ fig - agefeh ]",
    ", the solid line shows the prediction from a simple chemical evolution model that assumes instantaneous recycling , a closed box , star formation has gone to completion at the present time ( i.e. , the mass of gas at 15 gyr is zero ) and a star formation rate that is constant in time .",
    "layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) suggested such a model was a good fit to the age - metallicity relationship they derived from color - magnitude diagram analysis . a model with a yield of @xmath41",
    "is implied by our data although this model does not fit the data very well .",
    "note that this yield is much lower than the yield inferred from stellar nucleosynthesis . for comparison ,",
    "the yield in the galactic bulge , which is reasonably well fit by a simple closed box model , is @xmath42 ( rich 1990 ) and that implied by the the metallicity distribution function of the galactic disk indicates the yield is @xmath43 ( pagel & patchett 1975 ) .",
    "such a low yield in sgr implies that the closed box assumption is probably not valid . in a simple outflow model , where the outflow rate is assumed to be proportional to the star formation rate ( @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the star formation rate and @xmath46 is the dimensionless proportionality constant )",
    ", the age - metallicity relationship is identical to that predicted by the closed box model with the effective yield being @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , our sgr results would imply @xmath48 if the true yield is the same as that in the galaxy and thus mass loss has been a signficant factor in the evolution of the sgr dsph .      in this paper",
    ", we discuss the element ratios [ @xmath3/fe ] where @xmath3 is the average of si , ca , and ti abundances .",
    "the o abundances are much more uncertain because they are based on only 1 or 2 lines .",
    "figure [ fig - alphafe ] shows that the most metal - poor sgr dsph stars exhibit the enhanced [ @xmath3/fe ] ratio seen in galactic halo , near @xmath49 dex ; however , above [ fe / h]@xmath50@xmath511 , it is clear that the @xmath3-elements are deficient relative to the solar neighborhood at any given [ fe / h ] .",
    "the standard interpretation of this observation ( e.g. wheeler et al .",
    "1989 , mcwilliam 1997 ) is that the ratio of type  ia / type  ii sne material is larger in the sgr dsph than the solar neighborhood above @xmath52 .",
    "this , in turn is likely due to a slower star formation rate , for example , a longer e - folding timescale , in the sgr dsph .",
    "such variation of @xmath3-elements has long been predicted for low - mass systems ( e.g. matteucci & brocato 1990 , gilmore & wyse 1991 ) .",
    "a similar result was found for disk stars with large galactocentric radii in the study of edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , where it was concluded that the star formation proceeded at a slower pace for the outer disk than for the inner disk .",
    "note that the low metallicity stars in the sgr dsph have [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios similar to those of galactic halo stars , and essentially equal to the theoretical yield of type ii sne , means that the upper mass end of the initial mass function in the dsphs is not significantly different than that of the galaxy .",
    "this is a crucial point to establish because the upper - mass end of the initial mass function sets the amount of energy available to power galactic winds .      in figure [ fig - naal ]",
    "we show a comparison of [ al / fe ] and [ na / fe ] in the sgr dsph with the results for solar neighborhood stars from chen et al .",
    "the sgr stars with [ fe / h]@xmath53@xmath511 possess halo - like abundances of al and na , [ na / fe]@xmath50[al / fe]@xmath500 .",
    "a notable exception is star 1@xmath5173 with @xmath54 that shows a large enhancement of al , [ al / fe ] @xmath55 dex ( so large that it is not plotted in figure [ fig - naal ] ) , a small enhancement in na , [ na / fe ] @xmath56 , and a large deficit of o , the upper - limit being [ o / fe ] @xmath57 .",
    "we suggest this is due to proton - burning in the stellar atmosphere altering the star s primordial abundances , depleting o and creating na and al , similar to the pattern seen in some globular cluster red giants ( e.g. kraft et al .",
    "note that this star s derived metallicity is significantly different from the mean metallicity of m54 stars , @xmath58 ( brown , wallerstein & gonzalez 1999 ) .",
    "thus we believe this star is a field star and not a cluster member , although its position on the sky and radial velocity are not significantly different from m54 stars .",
    "if this star is a field star then the fraction of sgr field stars showing signs of proton burning is 7% , although the uncertainty is @xmath59% .",
    "this would significantly limit the amount of material from sgr - like dwarfs that has been incorporated into the galactic halo , because no field star ( with 160 surveyed to date ; fulbright 2000 ) in the galactic halo is observed to have undergone such processing . in the galaxy",
    ", proton buring appears to be a phenomenon solely limited to some ( but not all ) galactic globular cluster stars .",
    "therefore additional searches for field sgr stars with similar signs of proton - buring would be very interesting .    for the stars with @xmath60 both al and na are deficient relative to the solar neighborhood trend by @xmath61 dex . while such low [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] ratios are not unheard - of in the galaxy , they are extremely unusual , and never found in the metallicity range , @xmath62 , seen in the sgr dsph stars .",
    "apart from re - processing ne and mg by proton burning reactions in stellar envelopes , al and na are synthesized by carbon and oxygen burning , which only occurs in massive stars destined to end as type  ii sne .",
    "we suggest that the source of the al and na deficiencies seen in sgr dsph stars is due to a paucity of nucleosynthesis products from massive stars .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the observed deficiency in [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios .",
    "however , the al and na deficiencies are larger than the @xmath3-element lacuna , which might be understood if type  ia sne produce a small amount of @xmath3elements as suggested , for example , by nomoto et al .",
    "( 1984 ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig - laeuyfe2]a we present the trend of [ la / fe ] with [ fe / h ] ; while the metal - poor stars appear quite normal in this plot , the metal - rich stars show a steady increase in la enhancement with increasing [ fe / h ] , up to [ la / fe]@xmath63 dex . except for very metal - poor stars ,",
    "la is produced mostly by the s - process ; the solar s - process fraction for la is estimated at 75% ( burris et al .",
    "2000 ) . to investigate the neutron source for la in the sgr dsph stars we show the [ la / eu ] ratios in figure  [ fig - laeuyfe2]b",
    "; it is clear that [ la / eu ] is increasingly dominated by the s - process at higher [ fe / h ] . in particular , the three highest [ fe / h ] stars have super - solar [ la / eu]@xmath64 dex .",
    "note that normally we would like to use the [ ba / eu ] ratio , which is a more sensitive discriminator of s / r - process fractions ; but the ba lines in our spectra are so strong that they are on the flat portion of the curve of growth , and consequently not very sensitive to abundance . since agb stars are the dominant source of heavy s - process elements at galactic disk metallicities ( see travaglio et al .",
    "1999 ) , the sgr dsph heavy element abundance enhancements indicate a significant contribution from agb nucleosynthesis , which increases with [ fe / h ] .    in figure  [ fig - laeuyfe2]c we present a plot of [ la / y ] , showing that the light s - process element yttrium is not enhanced as much as the heavy s - process element lanthanum in the metal - rich sgr dsph stars ( [ la / y ] @xmath65 dex ) .",
    "this is characteristic of metal - poor s - process environments ( busso et al .",
    "1999 ) . from figure  16 of busso",
    "et al .  ( 1999 ) , we estimate that the metallicity of the stars responsible for the s - process enhancement in the metal - rich sgr dsph population was @xmath66 , or at a single , higher , metallicity , near @xmath67 ( due to the bi - valued nature of the heavy / light yield function ) . for agb s - process nucleosynthesis in the metal - rich sgr dsph stars with @xmath68 the [ la / y ] ratios",
    "are expected to be @xmath510.2 to @xmath510.3 dex ( busso et al .",
    "1999 ) , much lower than the observed value near @xmath690.5 dex .",
    "note that the metal - poor sgr dsph stars do not show the enhanced [ la / y ] ratios because of the importance of the r - process at @xmath70 .",
    "the observation that the s - process elements came from a significantly more metal - poor astrophysical site than the stars themselves , rules out the possibility that the metal - rich sgr dsph stars polluted their own atmospheres with s - process elements , or that s - process material was transferred from evolved companions ; it also eliminates the instantaneous re - cycling assumption for the chemical evolution of the sgr dsph .",
    "self pollution is also excluded because none of the metal - rich sgr dsph stars are luminous enough to be on the thermally - pulsing agb ( tp - agb ) ; the log l / l@xmath71 range is 2.54 to 3.07 , compared to the lowest tp - agb onset luminosity of log l / l@xmath71=3.1 from the calculations of boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988 ) .",
    "additional evidence against mass - transfer from an evolved companion comes from the frequency of such s - process enriched stars in the galactic disk , at only 1 to 2% ( macconnell & frye 1972 ) ; it seems very unlikely that all the metal - rich sgr dsph stars could have come from such a rare population .",
    "the observation that all the metal - rich sgr dsph stars show a similar enhancement in the [ la / y ] ratio is evidence that the progenitor agb stars responsible for the s - process elements were of a similar metallicity ; the simplest explanation is that the progenitors were from the metal - poor population .    since agb s - processing occurs in the approximate mass range @xmath72",
    ", we conclude that there was an extended period of star formation and chemical enrichment in the sgr dsph which lasted from @xmath500.5 to a few gyr .",
    "the metal - rich sgr dsph stars , @xmath73 , have derived ages from 0.5 to 3 gyr , while the metal - poor stars range from 5 to 13 gyr ; this is consistent with the expectation that ages decrease with increasing [ fe / h ] , and that the metal - poor population is similar to the galactic halo .",
    "the derived ages are in qualitative agreement with a period of extended star formation as indicated by the abundances of neutron - capture elements .",
    "we note that similar s - process enhancements have been seen in stars of the globular cluster omega cen ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "2000 ) , but at lower metallicity ; those observations were attributed to agb nucleosynthesis by m @xmath74 stars .",
    "thus , the detailed abundances of neutron capture elements in the sgr dsph indicate that the old , metal - poor , population was the dominant source of the heavy elements for the metal - rich population .",
    "this is quite contrary to the situation in the solar neighborhood , where the g - dwarf problem is the observation of the absence of a significant metal - poor thin disk .",
    "the unusual heavy element abundance patterns in metal - rich sgr dsph stars are also consistent with considerable mass loss from the galaxy after the initial formation , as indicated by the [ fe / h ] distribution ; if this were not the case , the high [ la / y ] ratios from the metal - poor component would have been overwhelmed by the products of a more populous metal - rich population .",
    "bonifacio et al .  ( 2000 ) derived chemical abundances for 2 red giants in the sgr dsph from high - dispersion spectra obtained with uves on the eso 8.2-meter telescope .",
    "their derived metallicities are [ fe / h ] @xmath75 and @xmath76 , similar to our dominant group at high metallicity .",
    "the abundance ratios they derive fit very well onto the trends defined by our data .",
    "they note that the unusual abundances found for the high metallicity sgr stars are very much like those seen in young supergiants in the large and small magellanic cloud ( c.f . , hill 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , our explanation of sgr s unusual abundance variations ",
    "namely , slow evolution of the star formation rate accompanied by mass loss and chemical enrichment of the young , metal - rich population by the old , metal - poor population  is probably applicable to the magellanic clouds .",
    "it is curious that the youngest stars in the sgr dsph have approximately the same metallicities , as measured by [ fe / h ] , as the young stars in the lmc despite the fact that the total absolute magnitude , m@xmath77 , for the lmc is more than 5 magnitudes brighter than the sgr dsph .",
    "is this an artifact of star formation running to completion in sgr dsph , or is that much of sgr s luminosity has already been stripped by tidal interactions with the galaxy ?",
    "a detailed modeling of the age and metallicity relationship is outside the scope of the present data .",
    "ideally , one would want to obtain spectroscopy for a large number of stars and simultaneously analyze the abundances and well - populated color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "however we can glean more information about the evolution of the sgr dsph by comparing our data to some simple models . in figure [ fig - agealphah ]",
    ", we plot the age and [ @xmath3/h ] abundance , which is more likely to be a good candidate for the instantaneous recycling approximation than [ fe / h ] because of the delayed explosion of type ia sne which generate significant amounts of fe but little @xmath3-elements . for each of the globular clusters , we have assumed [ @xmath3/fe ] = 0.21 , which is the value found by brown , wallerstein & gonzalez ( 1999 ) for m54 .",
    "figure [ fig - agealphah ] illustrates the results of simple outflow chemical evolution model with instantaneous recycling . for comparison ,",
    "they have all been normalized to pass through the same point .",

    "is illustrated by the red line .",
    "note that none of these simple outflow models accurately reproduce the observed age - metallicity relationship , but the sharp increase in [ @xmath3/h ] for ages @xmath84 gyr would imply an increasing , as opposed to decreasing , star formation rate .",
    "the most plausible model might well involve a discontinuous star formation rate .",
    "episodic star formation events have been found for a number of dsphs in the local group with the most stunning example being the carina dsph ( c.f .",

    "the [ @xmath3/fe ] ratios are , on average , slightly sub - solar in the metal - rich sub - sample ( @xmath87 dex ) , which implies a low type  ii / type  i sn ratio , and can most reasonably be understood as due to a relative paucity of type  ii sne , consistent with expectations for a slow , or possibly episodic , star - formation rate .    in the metal - rich sgr dsph",
    "stars the abundances of al and na are both deficient by @xmath500.4 dex , relative to iron , which has not previously been seen at this [ fe / h ] .",
    "since it is necessary for a star to go beyond carbon burning to produce large amounts of al and na ( ignoring the re - distribution of mg and ne by proton burning ) , we interpret the observed al and na abundance deficiencies as a consequence of the low frequency of type  ii sne .",
    "enhancements of neutron - capture heavy elements , which increase with [ fe / h ] , and the s - process signature seen in the [ la / eu ] ratios , indicate the importance of agb nucleosynthesis in the metal - rich sgr dsph population .",
    "however , the [ la / y ] ratios suggest a nucleosynthetic origin from sites of much lower metallicity than the stars themselves . these observations may be understood if heavy elements in the metal - rich population were dominated by the low - mass , long - lived , agb stars of the old , metal - poor population .",
    "the relatively long - lived agb progenitors require that star formation in sgr dsph took place over an extended period of time , at least 0.5 gyr , and probably a few gyr .",
    "this assertion is supported by age estimates for our sample of sgr dsph stars , based on padova isochrones , which span the range from 0.5 to 13 gyr .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge financial support from the nsf through grants ast-9619460 and ast-0070895 to tsh , and ast-9618623 and ast-0098612 to am .",
    "we wish to extend special thanks to the staff at keck observatory for their excellent observing support and to the people of hawaiian ancestry on whose sacred mountain we were privileged to be guests .",

    "<S> the type  ii / type  ia sn ratio was smaller than in the galactic disk , presumably due to a slower star formation rate ; this resulted in the observed low [ @xmath3/fe ] , [ al / fe ] and [ na / fe ] ratios . </S>",
