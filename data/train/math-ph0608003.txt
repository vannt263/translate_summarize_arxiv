    "the need for a hamiltonian description of dissipative systems has long been known .",
    "forty years ago morse and feshbach gave an example of an artificial hamiltonian for a damped oscillator based on a mirror - image  trick , incorporating a second oscillator with negative friction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch 3.2 ) .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is un - physical : it is unbounded from below and under time reversal the oscillator is transformed into its mirror - image .",
    "the artificial nature of this construction was described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 3.2 ) : `` by this arbitrary trick we are able to handle dissipative systems as though they were conservative .",
    "this is not very satisfactory if an alternate method of solution is known ... ''",
    "we propose here a quite general satisfactory solution  to the general problem posed in @xcite by constructing a hamiltonian for a time dispersive and dissipative ( tdd ) dynamical system _ without introducing negative friction _ and , in particular , without mirror - images .  developing a hamiltonian structure for a tdd system might seem a paradoxical goal  after all ,",
    "neither dissipation nor time dispersion occur in hamiltonian systems",
    ". however , we will see that if dissipation is introduced via a friction function , or _",
    "susceptibility _ , obeying a power dissipation condition  as it is for a linear dielectric medium described by the maxwell equations with frequency dependent material relations  then the dynamics are _ exactly _ reproduced by a particular coupling of the tdd system to an effective model for the normal modes of the underlying medium as independent oscillating strings . for the combined system",
    "we give a non - negative hamiltonian with a transparent interpretation as the system energy .",
    "an important motivation behind this effort is the clarification of the definition of the radiation energy density and stress tensor for a dissipative medium in the linear response theory , e.g. , a dielectric medium with complex valued frequency dependent material relations .",

    "these difficulties do not persist if a fundamental microscopic theory is considered .",
    "consequently a number of efforts @xcite have been made to construct a macroscopic theory of dielectric media , accounting for dispersion and dissipation , based on a more fundamental microscopic theory .",
    "it might seem that the introduction of an explicit realistic material medium is the only way to model a tdd system .",
    "however , the construction of this paper shows this is not so and provides a consistent macroscopic approach _ within linear response theory_.    as an example of our general construction , we analyze here tdd dielectric media , including a detailed analysis of the electromagnetic energy and momentum densities .",
    "part of that analysis is the derivation of an approximate formula for the time averaged maxwell stress tensor similar to the brillouin formula for the time averaged energy density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 80 ) .",
    "another important benefit of the approach developed here  and in our previous work @xcite  is that the present formulation allows to apply the well developed scattering theory for conservative systems @xcite to the long long standing problem of scattering from a lossy non spherical scatter   analyzed by other methods with limited success @xcite .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "we consider a system to be dissipative if energy tends to decrease under its evolution .",
    "it is common , taking energy conservation as a fundamental principle , to view a dissipative system as coupled to a heat bath so that energy lost to dissipation is viewed as having been absorbed by the heat bath .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that , indeed , a general linear causal tdd system can be represented as a subsystem of a conservative system , with the minimal such extension unique up to isomorphism .",
    "let us summarize the main ideas of that work here .",

    "that is @xmath23    the main object of this work is to extend @xcite by considering dissipative systems with a given hamiltonian structure . here and",
    "below we call a system _ hamiltonian _ if its phase space is endowed with a symplectic structure and a hamiltonian function such that : i. ) the system evolves by hamilton s equations , and ii . ) the physical energy of the system in a configuration associated to a phase space point @xmath24 is equal to the value of the hamiltonian function at @xmath24 .",
    "accordingly , a dissipative system is by definition not hamiltonian . nonetheless , almost every dissipative system of interest to physics is a perturbation of a hamiltonian system , with the perturbation accounting for dispersion and dissipation .",
    "the property of being hamiltonian , as defined above , is more than a formal property of the evolution equations , as it also involves a physical restriction equating the hamilton function and the system energy . for a linear system such as",
    "there are many ways to represent the evolution equations as hamilton s equations .",
    "we circumvent this ambiguity by supposing given a hamiltonian structure on the given tdd system , whose evolution is a suitable perturbation of the hamilton equations .",
    "we then ask , and answer affirmatively , the question ,  is there a natural way to extend the given hamiltonian structure to the unique minimal conservative extension of @xcite so that the extended system is hamiltonian ? \"",

    "uniqueness may be verified by the arguments of @xcite . for completeness",
    "we give a more detailed sketch of the proof in appendix [ sketch ] .",

    "the theorem guarantees the existence of a unique minimal extension of the form to the evolution in stress space .",

    "the main point of this work is to exhibit an explicit hamiltonian extension with these properties , that may then be used in the analysis of conservation laws for the dissipative system .",

    "in fact , it is _ not _ minimal .",
    "indeed , easily shows that any configuration of the hidden string resulting from a physical driving force @xmath155 is symmetric under @xmath156 .",

    "if the kernel of the susceptibility @xmath161 is non - trivial on a set of positive measure we will see in  [ stringft ] that further reductions are possible .",
