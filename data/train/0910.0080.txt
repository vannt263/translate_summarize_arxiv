    "we consider a @xmath9 cubic crystal with a scalar displacement field @xmath10 defined on each lattice site @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "two of the faces of the crystal , namely those at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are coupled to white noise langevin type heat baths so that the equations of motion of the particles are given by : _ & = & - _ + & + & _ n_1,1 ( -_+^l _ ) + _ n_1,n ( -_+^r _ )  .",
    "[ eqm ] the noise terms at different sites are uncorrelated while at a given site the noise strength is specified by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the temperatures of the left and right baths and we have chosen units where the boltzmann constant @xmath21 . fixed boundary conditions were used for the particles connected to the baths and periodic boundary conditions were imposed in all the other directions .",
    "we simulate these equations using a velocity - verlet algorithm @xcite and calculate the heat current and the temperature profile in the nonequilibrium steady state of the crystal . the heat current @xmath22 from the lattice site @xmath23 to @xmath24 where @xmath25 , is given by @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the force on the particle at site @xmath24 due to the particle at site @xmath23 . in our simulations",
    "we calculate the average current per bond given by j= _ n_1=1^n-1 _ n_2,n_3=1^w j _  .",
    "we also calculate the average temperature across layers in the slab and this is given by @xmath28 .",
    "in all our simulations we set @xmath29 and @xmath30 . we first address the question of the dependence of @xmath31 on the width @xmath1 of the system and the nature of the cross - over from @xmath32 behaviour , for small values of the ratio @xmath33 , to true @xmath9 behavior for @xmath34 .",
    "the numerical results are given in fig .",

    "we see that for any fixed length @xmath0 , the value of @xmath31 decreases as we increase @xmath1 but saturates quickly to the @xmath9 value .",
    "the cross - over width @xmath35 is seen to increase slowly with @xmath0 .",
    "the inset shows that as we increase @xmath0 , the cross - over from @xmath32 to @xmath9 behavior takes place at decreasing values of @xmath36 and presumably in the thermodynamic limit @xmath37 , the cross - over occurs at @xmath38 .",
    "thus our study suggests that @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "a similar result was obtained by grassberger and yang @xcite for a @xmath41 fpu system .",
    "next we look at the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath0 for the @xmath9 case .",
    "the fast cross - over from @xmath32 to @xmath9 behaviour implies that we can extrapolate the results for small @xmath36 to estimate the true value of the @xmath9 current ( at @xmath42 ) .",
    "thus we can get results for quite large values of @xmath0 from simulations on systems with small widths . for sizes up to @xmath43 we obtained data for @xmath44 .",
    "for the largest system size , namely @xmath45 we have data for @xmath46 .",
    "we show our results for the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "( [ jvsn ] ) .",
    "there are three sources of error in the values of current : ( i ) numerical errors , arising from the finite time discretization value ( @xmath47 ) , and from rounding off errors ; ( ii ) statistical errors arising from averaging over a finite number of time steps ; and ( iii ) errors arising from the extrapolation of the small aspect ratio ( @xmath36 ) results to the @xmath9 case . the error from ( iii )",
    "was taken to be the difference in current values for the two largest widths studied . for smaller system sizes we verified that the numerical error was much smaller than the statistical and extrapolation errors and",
    "we assume that this is true also at larger system sizes .",

    "the dashed line is a guide to the eyes .",
    ", width=307 ]    the slope of the @xmath2 versus @xmath0 curve is decreasing slowly with @xmath0 and a straight line fit to the last three points gives an exponent @xmath49 .",
    "for comparison we also show in fig .",
    "( [ jvsn ] ) the @xmath32 and @xmath41 data for the fpu system .",
    "the @xmath41 results are from data for @xmath50 samples for systems up to @xmath51 while for larger sizes the results shown are extrapolated values from small width data . in @xmath32",
    "we get @xmath52 @xcite while in @xmath41 we get @xmath53 . in the inset of fig .",
    "( [ jvsn ] ) we have plotted the running slope defined as @xmath48 against system size . from this we see that while the slopes in @xmath32 and @xmath41 tend to saturate , the @xmath9 slope seems to be decreasing .",
    "the @xmath9 slope can be fitted by the dashed line with a power law form .",
    "this suggests that the asymptotic system size behaviour will give @xmath54 implying diffusive transport and validity of fourier s law .",
    "one of the remarkable features of @xmath32 systems with anomalous heat transport is the form of the steady state temperature profile obtained in these systems .",
    "typically one finds that the temperature profile is concave upwards in part of the system and concave downwards elsewhere and this is true even for small temperature differences @xcite .",
    "this means that the temperature gradient is non - monotonic as a function of distance across the sample . in fig.([temp_pro ] ) we plot the temperature profiles for the @xmath32 , @xmath41 and @xmath9 samples .",
    "we see that the variation of the temperature gradients are non - monotonic in both @xmath32 and @xmath41 while in @xmath9 they are monotonic .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "( [ temp_pro])shows that the @xmath9 temperature profile is concave upward everywhere .",
    "we have also confirmed that the profile becomes more linear on decreasing the temperature difference between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this again supports our finding based on the size - dependence of the current , that heat transport in @xmath9 is diffusive while in lower dimensions it is anomalous .",
    "finally we look at the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity . temperature and nonlinearity",
    "are highly correlated @xcite , and temperature dependence can be understood from the nonlinearity dependence of thermal conductivity .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eqm ] ) leads to the scaling relation @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is an arbitrary scale factor .",
    "taking the limit @xmath59 , this gives the scaling relation for thermal conductivity as @xmath60 .",
    "putting @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we then get ( t , ) = ( t , 1 ) [ conductivity_scaling ] .",
    "thus the thermal conductivity is a function of @xmath63 .",
    "one may expect that large @xmath15 suppresses heat currents due to enhancement of phonon - phonon interactions .",
    "hence from the scaling ( [ conductivity_scaling ] ) we expect that @xmath2 must also decrease with increasing @xmath64 . to check this , we show the dependence of the heat current on @xmath63 for a @xmath65 system with a small temperature difference @xmath66 . in fig.([temp_depe ] ) , we compared two cases : one with @xmath67 fixed and @xmath64 varied , and another with @xmath68 fixed and @xmath15 varied .",
    "we find that current decreases as a function of @xmath63 , consistent with the scaling relation eq .",
    "( [ conductivity_scaling ] ) .",
    "we note that fourier s law ( [ fourier ] ) leads to @xmath69 and so the decrease of @xmath2 in the region @xmath70 $ ] with @xmath67 is consistent with the concave curve in the @xmath9 temperature profiles .",
    "interestingly at large anharmonicity the current does not seem to go to zero but instead appears to saturate to a constant value . at low temperatures",
    "the effect of anharmonicity becomes weaker and we expect the conductivity to increase , eventually diverging in the limit @xmath71 .",
    "it is difficult to numerically access the low temperature regime since the mean free path becomes large and one would need much larger system sizes to see diffusive behaviour .",
    "in summary , we have given the first numerical evidence for the validity of fourier s law of heat conduction in an anharmonic crystal in three dimensions .",
    "this confirms the belief that in three dimensions anharmonicity is a _ sufficient _ condition for normal transport .",
    "this is not a necessary condition since , for example , a @xmath9 pinned disordered purely harmonic crystal also shows normal transport @xcite .",
    "our conclusion was based on three evidences .",
    "the first is the system - size dependence of the thermal conductivity , the second is temperature profile , and the third is the consistency between temperature profile and temperature dependence of conductivity .",
    "it has been known that the one - dimensional fpu system shows slow convergence of the thermal conductivity to it s asymptotic behavior @xcite . here",
    "we show that this is also the case in @xmath9 .",
    "unlike @xmath32 and @xmath41 , the running slope of the size dependence of @xmath2 in @xmath9 showed decreasing behavior even at the largest system size and this gives us a clear signature for finite @xmath2 .",
    "the temperature profiles in @xmath9 are completely different type from the @xmath32 and @xmath41 case where nonmonotonic behavior of the gradient is robust even for small temperature differences .",
    "we note that a recent simulation of heat conduction in the @xmath9 fpu crystals reported diverging thermal conductivity ( the reported exponent is about @xmath72 ) @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this is probably because of the small values of anharmonicity used in those simulations and also the much smaller system sizes that were studied ( maximum size in that study was @xmath73 ) . in @xmath41",
    "we find a divergence of the conductivity with an exponent @xmath53 which is similar to the value obtained in @xcite .    for a sample of fixed length @xmath0",
    "we find that the current density decreases on increasing its width @xmath1 and the cross - over from @xmath32 to @xmath9 behaviour takes place at a value @xmath74 with @xmath40 .",
    "this has implications for experiments measuring thermal conductivity of nanowires @xcite .",
    "if the cross - over width were independent of @xmath0 and the width of the nanowire larger than it , then the thermal conductivity of long nanowires could well be finite and not diverge as expected for true @xmath32 systems .",
    "on the other hand , since the cross - over width gradually increases with increasing @xmath0 , a gradual transition from @xmath9-like to @xmath32 behavior will take place when the cross - over width is comparable to the width of nanowires .",
    "this scenario is an interesting system size effect that may be observed in experiments on nanowires .",
    "system , a @xmath50 @xmath41 system and a @xmath75 @xmath9 system with different aspect ratios @xmath33 .",

    "thermal conductivities decrease as increasing temperature @xmath64 or nonlinearity @xmath15 .",
