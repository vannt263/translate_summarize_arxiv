    "overlap fermions  @xcite have emerged in recent years as one of the most promising formulations for simulating on the lattice theories that possess an exact chiral symmetry . the overlap - dirac operator proposed by neuberger",
    "@xcite is one of the solutions of the ginsparg - wilson relation  @xcite @xmath2 and allows the realization of an exact chiral symmetry also at non - zero lattice spacing  @xcite without giving up other important symmetries .",
    "although simulations with the neuberger operator look computationally demanding when compared with wilson fermions , progress is under way in simulating overlap fermions and in improving the efficiencies of their simulation algorithms  @xcite .",
    "results of some recent simulations show remarkable evidence of the signatures of the exact chiral symmetry .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite provides strong numerical evidence that the pion mass approaches zero in the limit @xmath3 without additive renormalization , in the two - dimensional schwinger model , and progress is on the way for qcd ; in ref .  @xcite it is shown how the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation , which is a test of chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing , is satisfied to better than 1% down to quark masses as small as @xmath4 .",
    "there is some confidence that overlap fermions will at the end turn out to be not too computationally demanding , and in any case one has to take into account all the advantages of having an exact chiral symmetry as well as the rapid progress in computer technology that is taking place these days .    in this paper",
    "we present the computation of the renormalization factors of many operators that measure moments of various structure functions , using overlap fermions .",
    "the operators that we consider include all three parton distributions that characterize the quarks in the nucleon and provide a complete description of quark momentum and spin at leading twist : the momentum distribution @xmath5 , the helicity distribution @xmath6 and the transversity distribution @xmath7 .",
    "we also study the @xmath0 structure function , which receives contributions from twist-3 operators . for each one of these structure functions",
    ", we have included in our study all the moments that can be measured by operators for which all tensor indices are distinct .",
    "on the lattice with overlap fermions , all these operators are then multiplicatively renormalized .",
    "one of the advantages of overlap fermions is that lattice renormalization does not induce any mixings with operators of the wrong chirality , as instead it happens with wilson fermions .",
    "while this issue is of the utmost importance in lattice simulations concerning weak decays and quantities like the cp - violation parameter @xmath8  @xcite , it is also relevant here for some of the operators that measure the @xmath0 structure function , which for wilson fermions mix with coefficients diverging as @xmath9 , while for overlap fermions they are multiplicatively renormalized ( see sect .  5 ) .",
    "another advantage of overlap fermions is the reduction of the number of independent renormalization factors in a given physical situation , as can be seen here with the operators measuring unpolarized and polarized structure functions which differ by a @xmath10 matrix .",
    "significant computational gains are achieved in the improvement of the action ( which is not needed at all ) and of the operators , as the construction of improved operators and the calculation of their renormalization constants is much simpler for overlap than for wilson fermions ( see sect .  4 ) .",
    "we think that this is really an important point for the operators considered in this paper , as the full @xmath11 improvement of dis operators with wilson fermions involves a significant amount of careful and cumbersome calculations .    among the other solutions of the ginsparg - wilson relation ,",
    "a popular one is given by domain - wall fermions , where however the decoupling of the chiral modes is achieved only in the limit in which the number of points in the fifth additional dimension goes to infinity .",
    "one of the most attractive features of overlap fermions is that , on the contrary , chiral symmetry is fully preserved for any finite volume of the lattice . as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite state , `` in practical applications , it is our present experience that it is easier to control chiral symmetry violations with neuberger s operator '' .",
    "the renormalization with overlap fermions of the lowest two moments of the quark momentum and helicity distributions has been already carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refer to that paper for the general framework and conventions , as well as for the feynman rules of the overlap theory that we use here .",
    "we recall only that the explicit form of the overlap - dirac operator is @xmath12 , \\label{eq : dn}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 with @xmath14 , in terms of the usual wilson - dirac operator @xmath15 , \\ ] ] @xmath16 .\\ ] ]    since the renormalization constants for many of the operators considered in this paper had not even been computed with wilson fermions , we have calculated them for all the operators considered here with wilson fermions too , and in this way we have also checked some old results in the literature , finding a discrepancy in one case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the various operators of which we have computed the renormalization constants , in sect .  3 their renormalization on the lattice",
    "is discussed and some details about the perturbative calculations are given , in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the advantages of using overlap over wilson fermions with regard to the improvement , and in sect .  5",
    "we present the complete results . in the appendices we give the results for the quark self - energy , both for overlap and for wilson fermions , and for the individual proper diagrams .",
    "we have considered in this paper the lowest moments of a few structure functions which give a complete description of quark momentum and spin at leading twist : the momentum distribution @xmath5 , measured by the @xmath17 and @xmath18 unpolarized structure functions , the helicity distribution @xmath6 , measured by the @xmath19 structure function , and the transversity distribution @xmath7 , measured by the @xmath1 structure function  @xcite .",

    "we choose as continuum scheme the @xmath55 scheme , since commonly the wilson coefficients are computed in this scheme . on the lattice",

    "they utilize an ensemble of routines written in the symbolic manipulation language form , and are able to do the analytic calculations ; fortran codes subsequently perform the numerical integrations .",
    "these routines are an extension of the ones used to do calculations with the wilson action in various occasions  @xcite and to compute the first two moments of the momentum and helicity distributions with overlap fermions  @xcite .",

    "we would like to stress that one of the major checks of our calculations , which are all done in a general covariant gauge  ] ] , is the cancellation of the gauge - dependent terms proportional to @xmath69 in the final numbers that connect the lattice to the @xmath55 scheme , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zlatcont ] ) .",
    "another significant check with overlap fermions is that the operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 have the same @xmath72 well within numerical integration errors , as well as @xmath49 and @xmath73 , as expected from chiral symmetry .",
    "furthermore , we verified that there is no @xmath9 mixing term in the 1-loop expressions of the operators @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , contrary to what happens in the wilson case .",
    "the computations of the integrals for the operators @xmath49 , @xmath73 and @xmath76 have been the most demanding .",
    "we had to split the form outputs in several pieces as otherwise the fortran programs would refuse to compile them .",
    "the running time for the computation of the integrals on a @xmath77 grid has been in these cases of the order of 500 hours on a 500 mhz cpu .",
    "to highlight the advantages of overlap fermions relative to wilson fermions , we summarize the differences in @xmath11 improvement using each method .",
    "although the overlap - dirac action possesses an exact chiral symmetry and has no @xmath11 terms , matrix elements of operators do have order @xmath78 corrections and therefore they need to be improved .",
    "the operators considered in this paper , which are all of the form @xmath79 , are made free of @xmath11 corrections by taking  @xcite @xmath80 thus , in the overlap formulation , by rotating the spinors as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : opimp ] ) , operators are freed of @xmath11 corrections . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that this recipe improves the operators to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "thus , full @xmath11 improvement is achieved without tuning any coefficients .",
    "furthermore , the renormalization constants for the improved and unimproved operators are the same , so there is no need to do additional calculations , which are generally cumbersome , to compute the renormalization factors in the improved theory .",
    "what happens is that in 1-loop amplitudes a factor @xmath81 can combine with a quark propagator , but since it has an @xmath78 in front and ( contrary to the wilson case ) there is no @xmath9 piece in the propagator , as additive mass renormalization is forbidden by chiral symmetry , the contribution of @xmath81 to the renormalization factors is zero  @xcite .",
    "thus , improved monte carlo simulations are performed with the operator  ( [ eq : opimp ] ) , nevertheless the renormalization of this operator is equal to that of the corresponding unimproved operator .    for wilson fermions , instead , the improvement of operators looks more complicated and troublesome .",
    "first of all , one has to find out a complete basis which includes all operators which are one - dimension higher than the original one and have the same symmetries .",
    "then , to get the improved renormalization factors , which are different from the unimproved ones , one has to compute the 1-loop matrix elements of each one of those operators .",
    "lastly , one has to determine somehow the values of the coefficients in front of the operator counterterms , and this appears to be a highly non - trivial task .",
    "let us consider , for example , the first moment of the quark momentum distribution , @xmath82 .",
    "the improvement counterterms are two dimension - five operators  @xcite , and one basis for the improvement is given by @xmath83 \\psi      -\\frac{1}{4 } a c_2 ( g_0 ^ 2 ) \\",
    ", \\bar{\\psi } \\big\\ { d_\\mu , d_\\nu      \\big\\ } \\psi .\\ ] ]",
    "the operator is fully @xmath11 improved only for some particular values of the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "however , presently one knows only a relation between the two coefficients  @xcite , and thus one of them remains unknown .",
    "although one could determine all coefficients using some ward identities or physical conditions , this involves more effort than with overlap fermions .",
    "in addition , the coefficients are different for different orders in perturbation theory , and the basis itself is different for each operator to be improved .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that operators which contain more covariant derivatives will have larger improvement bases , and thus many more coefficients to be determined , besides computing the 1-loop matrix elements for each of the operator counterterms .",
    "presumably already implementing the improvement for the second moment operators with wilson fermions will turn out to be a daunting task .",
    "this means that in most cases it will be difficult to go beyond tree - level improvement for the structure function operators in the wilson case .",
    "in addition to improving operators , one should also note that wilson fermions need corrections to their action ( the sheikholeslami - wohlert term ) , while the overlap action is already @xmath11 improved .",
    "however , this is less of a complication than the improvement of the operators .",
    "thus , for all these reasons , from the perspective of renormalization , mixing , and improvement , overlap fermions offer compelling advantages relative to wilson fermions .",
    ".the feynman - gauge constants @xmath86 for the momentum , helicity and transversity operators considered in this work , in the overlap theory . note that in this case @xmath87 and @xmath88 . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this appendix we give the results for the finite parts of the proper diagrams : the vertex ( diagram a in fig .",
    "1 ) , the sails ( diagrams b plus c ) and the operator tadpole ( diagram d ) . we have used the abbreviation @xmath89 .",
    "table b.1 refers to overlap fermions ( for @xmath90 ) and table b.2 to wilson fermions . for the latter ,",
    "table b.3 also reports the numbers giving the mixing with the lower dimensional operators .",
    "note that the sum of the @xmath91 parts of vertex and sails is independent of the fermion action used , and in general this is also true for the individual diagrams .",
    "an exception to this are the @xmath45 operators and the quark self - energy , and these are also the same cases for which with wilson fermions there is a 1-loop mixing with a @xmath9 divergent coefficient , while with overlap fermions such mixings are forbidden by chiral symmetry .",
