    "recently @xcite completed a more generalized treatment of the conversion factor including radiative transfer and concludes that the true exponential dependences of @xmath54 and t@xmath56 are weaker than 0.5 and -1 , respectively .",
    "however in all cases modelled , the dependences remain positive for @xmath54 and negative for t@xmath56 .    in summary ,",
    "it is not possible to reconcile bright hc@xmath0n emission from uniformly cool , dense gas ( low t@xmath56 , high @xmath54 and high @xmath111 ) with the known total amount of h@xmath4 present if virialized constant density clumps are adopted .",
    "the lack of an apparent connection between @xmath105 of the dense component and the observed conversion factor indicates that the clouds in the nucleus of ic 342 can not be treated as simple virialized collections of uniform density clumps .",
    "one might expect that a large fraction of the c@xmath1o emission could originate from a moderate density component that is distinct from the denser , hc@xmath0n - emitting gas .",

    "table [ tlvg2 ] displays the adopted c@xmath1o lvg solutions , along with the new @xmath123 and m@xmath119/m@xmath124 for the two component model , assuming , for simplicity , that t@xmath56 is the same for both components .",
    "@xmath123 and hence @xmath98 are decreased from the simple one component model by factors of at least four .",
    "this simple extension results in closer agreement between the observed and calculated values of x@xmath112 ( especially when including the somewhat super - virial line widths ) , while maintaining most of the mass in the dense ( low filling factor ) component .",
    "it is almost certainly the case that this extension is an oversimplification .",
    "in reality , we expect the clouds to exhibit a continuum of densities .",
    "however the lvg modeling demonstrates that at least these three components are required to match the multi - transition observations of @xmath113co , @xmath125co , c@xmath1o and hc@xmath0n .",
    "this is consistent with conclusions from recent single - dish modeling of higher j transitions of hc@xmath0n @xcite , but we find multiple components are required to match intensities not only between gmcs but within individual gmcs .",
    "hcn(10 ) emission is the workhorse for relating quantities of dense gas to star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to compare conclusions about the dense component from hc@xmath0n with those of the more commonly used hcn(10 ) .",
    "hcn(10 ) has been mapped at similar spatial resolution by @xcite .",
    "figure [ inticont ] compares hc@xmath0n(54 ) to hcn(10 ) . while hc@xmath0n generally traces the same dense gmcs seen in hcn their relative brightnesses are rather different . in hcn(10 ) gmc a , b and c are all within 10 % of the same brightness and gmcs d and e are 100 % and 50 % weaker , respectively .",
    "whereas in hc@xmath0n(54 ) and ( 1615 ) , c dominates , b is nearly absent and a is not significantly different from d and e. comparisons with hc@xmath0n clearly demonstrate that there is larger variations in dense gas properties than hcn indicates .",
    "the dominate difference is enhanced hcn towards the starburst and gmc a relative to gmc c. unlike the hc@xmath0n transitions , hcn(10 ) is optically thick and has slightly larger ( 25 - 50 % ) filling factors @xcite . as kinetic temperatures increase optically thick transitions brighten more rapidly than ( lower excitation ) optically thin transitions .",
    "hence it is expected that the hcn emission should favor somewhat warmer dense gas .",
    "likely this effect results in the much brighter relative hcn(10 ) intensities towards the starburst . the relative enhancement towards gmc a is less clear .",
    "however , this cloud is known to be dominated by pdrs @xcite , strongly influenced by mechanical feedback from the nuclear cluster @xcite and has a complicated hc@xmath0n temperature and velocity structure ( sections [ morp ] and [ ratio ] ) .",
    "this cloud must have a complex density and temperature structure , potentially with a warmer intermediate density medium ( table [ trat ] ) .",
    "moreover , hcn abundances can be elevated in pdrs .",
    "we conclude that while hcn(10 ) does a good job locating the dense gas but it does a poorer job tracing small scale variation in the properties of the dense gas when a mix of strong star formation and quiescent gas are present .",
    "it is expected that such effects should become more important as specific star formation rates increase and spatial scales decrease .",
    "the brightest hc@xmath0n emission and the brightest star - forming regions do not coincide .",
    "most of the current star formation , traced by bright infrared and thermal radio continuum emission @xcite , is situated about 50 pc to the southwest of the dynamical center , in the vicinity of gmc b. the brightest hc@xmath0n emission by far is on the northeast side of the nucleus , in the northern molecular arm centered at gmc c2 .",
    "this region has free - free emission amounting to only a third of the brightness of the strongest radio source , associated with gmc b. the faintness , in absolute terms , of hc@xmath0n(1615 ) towards gmc b is unexpected and important reflecting a much lower areal filling of warm , very dense gas here .",
    "either the number of cloud clumps or their size is small relative to the other gmcs .    on the other hand",
    ", the excitation of hc@xmath0n does reflect the presence of young forming stars .",
    "hc@xmath0n(1615 ) and hc@xmath0n(109 ) are relatively brighter towards the current starburst .",
    "this suggests that the absence of a correlation between hc@xmath0n(54 ) intensity and star formation is partly due to depopulation of the lower energy transitions .",
    "gmcs that are faint in the hc@xmath9n j=1615 transition and not associated with strong star formation show up well at the lower j transitions of hc@xmath0n , as would be expected for gas of lower excitation .",
    "clearly there is a large amount of dense gas currently not actively forming stars , that shows up in the low excitation transitions of hc@xmath0n .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that both hnc(10 ) and n@xmath4h@xmath126(10 ) , generally considered dense quiescent gas tracers , are found to be very bright towards ic 342 s nucleus @xcite .",
    "hc@xmath0n(54 ) appears to be an excellent extragalactic probe of the dense , quiescent molecular gas component not yet involved in the current starburst .    to quantitatively compare star formation with dense gas , a star formation rate",
    "is derived from the 45 ghz continuum flux ( spectral indices measured between 2 cm and 7 mm demonstrate that the vast majority of flux toward gmcs b and c is thermal bremsstrahlung ) . the star formation rate",
    "is then compared with @xmath91 ( table [ tlvg2 ] ) to estimate a dense gas star formation efficiency , sfe@xmath127 .",
    "dense gas depletion timescales , @xmath128= 1/sfe@xmath119 , are also computed . in table",

    "* ) , then sfe@xmath119 for the starburst is @xmath132 , or dense gas depletion times of @xmath133 2 - 3 myr !",
    "this highly enhanced sfe@xmath119 is a direct consequence of the faint hc@xmath0n emission here . even towards the non - starburst clouds sfe@xmath119 are @xmath134 yr@xmath15 .",
    "these efficiencies are sufficiently short that they imply dense gas consumption timescales that are non - negligible fractions of the expected gmc lifetimes .",
    "the dense sfe is rather high across the nucleus , but the extreme value towards gmc b is remarkable .",
    "@xcite argued that intense star formation is suppressed along the spiral arms being triggered when the inflowing molecular gas collides with the inner ring molecular gas .",
    "therefore it is reasonable that in a relative sense sfe@xmath119 is lower away from the central ring .",
    "however this leaves unexplained why gmc b s sfe@xmath119 is so much larger than gmc c , though its positions at the arm / inner ring intersection is the same .",
    "we suggest this is a sign of the evolution of star formation across the nucleus that is impacted by radiative and mechanical feed - back _ from within _ the molecular cloud .",
    "a possible cause of the different sfe@xmath119 between gmc c and b is that we are observing the clouds at high enough spatial resolution to begin to identify the changing internal structure of the clouds in the presence of the starburst . over the lifetime of a cloud sfes",
    "vary . in the earliest stages of a star formation episode sfes will appear low because elevated star formation rates have yet to convert the bulk of the molecular material to stars . towards the final stages of a gmcs evolution",
    "instantaneous sfes appear to increase dramatically as the cloud clumps are consumed , destroyed or dispersed .",
    "so observed instantaneous sfes are expected to vary widely throughout the lifetime of an individual gmc and relative to lifetime averaged sfes typically considered in extragalactic studies .",
    "if starburst b is a few myrs more evolved than the other gmcs , especially the dynamical similar c , then we may be witnessing the consumption , dispersal or destruction phase of the remaining dense clumps in the presence of the expanding hii region .",
    "the magnitude of the dense gas consumption times for b are indeed shorter than the lifetime of the gmc . several lines of evidence suggest that the ( weaker ) star formation towards c2 may be at a somewhat earlier phase .",
    "these include less extended hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bright hot core - like species",
    "ch@xmath0oh @xcite , nh@xmath0(6,6 ) @xcite and co(65 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and more mm dust continuum emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to compare the thermal pressure of the starburst hii region with that of the dense clumps along the same line of sight . assuming a strmgren sphere of r@xmath133 pc , n@xmath135 s@xmath15 and t@xmath136 = 8000 k , parameters determined for the main starburst hii @xcite , the thermal pressure of such an hii region would be @xmath137t@xmath136 = @xmath138 @xmath6 k. this value is equal given the uncertainties to @xmath139t@xmath140 @xmath6 k for the dense component of gmc b , hinting at pressure balance between the dense clumps and the hii region .",
    "in addition , the filling factor of the hii region is larger than implied by the hc@xmath0n lvg analysis .",
    "so it is possible that hc@xmath0n emission towards gmc b comes from dense clumps embedded within the hii region .",
    "the above analysis suggests the following physical picture for the faint hc@xmath0n emission towards the starburst .",
    "the starburst towards b is more evolved .",
    "the hii region at gmc b has had time to expand , destroying or dispersing the dense gas , which is now in the form of smaller clumps and/or more diffuse gas .",
    "clumps that remain there must have high pressure to survive . near the younger star forming cloud gmc c ( particularly toward gmc c2 ) , the hii regions may just be developing , and have not had time to disperse the clouds .",
    "the dense clumps here would be more abundant and still present a hot core - like chemistry .",
    "the clouds further from the central are on average less dense and at the current epoch remain largely quiescent , except possibly d , where the second high excitation component could be associated with the presence of shocks @xcite .",
    "we have imaged the hc@xmath9n j=54 line in the nucleus of ic 342 with the vla and the hc@xmath0n(1615 ) line with the pdbi at @xmath141  resolution .",
    "these are the first maps of these transitions in an external galaxy .",
    "we have detected emission extended along the nuclear  mini - spiral \" in ( 54 ) and more concentrated emission in ( 16 - 15 ) , with relative abundance of @xmath142 .",
    "_ hc@xmath0n emission is not tightly correlated with star formation strength .",
    "_ dense gas _ excitation _ however , follows star formation more closely .",
    "gmc b , which is weak in all the hc@xmath0n lines , is relatively stronger in the higher j lines .",
    "lvg modeling indicates that the hc@xmath9n - emitting gas has densities of 10@xmath143 . in ic 342 ,",
    "physical conditions of the densest component are fairly constant away from the immediate environment of the starburst , though beyond the central ring densities begin to fall .",
    "comparison with the c@xmath1o observations of @xcite reveal excitation temperatures similar to c@xmath1o values indicating either that the molecular gas is dense and cool ( t@xmath144 k ) or that there are multiple gas components where the densities and kinetic temperatures of each component conspire to give similar overall excitation .",
    "the strong over - prediction of the amount of gas mass present if densities are large and temperatures cool , favors a multi - component ism with at least two components beside the diffuse one seen in @xmath113co(21 ) . the actual ism is likely a continuum of cloud densities with different densities dominating different tracers .",
    "hc@xmath0n also differs in morphology from hcn(10 ) , with hcn(10 ) being much brighter towards the starburst .",
    "this is further evidence that there are multiple dense gas components .    of particular interest ,",
    "the starburst site ( gmc b ) exhibits the largest difference in intensity between hc@xmath0n ( both transitions ) and hcn(10 ) .",
    "the faintness of the hc@xmath0n here suggests that the brightness of hcn(10 ) is not due solely to large quantities of dense gas . a comparison between the gmcs with the largest star formation rates and similar dynamical environments , b and c , hint at an explanation .",
    "while gmc b shows higher excitation , the low brightness of this cloud indicates that it is composed of a relatively small amount of warm , dense clumps .",
    "the smaller amount of dense gas at the site of the strongest young star formation indicate high star formation efficiencies in the dense gas . towards gmc c , hc@xmath0n , ch@xmath0oh and nh@xmath0",
    "are more intense and the fraction of millimeter continuum from dust is higher .",
    "this indicates that gmc c is in an early , less evolved ( hot core - like ) state .",
    "the extreme dense gas star formation efficiency observed towards gmc b reflects the fact the main burst is in a more evolved state .",
    "the dense clumps towards the starburst are being dispersed or destroyed in the presence of the hii region .",
    "the little dense gas remaining appears to be in pressure equilibrium with the hii region .",
    "the larger opacity of hcn(10 ) relative to hc@xmath0n elevates its brightness temperature in this warm gas and lowers its critical density permitting it to remain excited in the somewhat lower density component .",
    "we conclude that evla observations of hc@xmath0n(54 ) can be a powerful probe of dense , quiescent molecular gas in galaxies , and when combined with high resolution imaging of the higher j transitions of hc@xmath0n with current and upcoming mm interferometers ( like alma ) provide tight constraints on dense molecular gas properties in stronger or more widespread starbursts , where changes like those localized to gmc b are expected to permeate much of the ism .",

    "<S> hc@xmath0n(54 ) line emission is found across the nuclear mini - spiral , but is very weak towards the starburst site , the location of the strongest mid - ir and radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> the j=1615 and 109 lines are also faint near the large hii region complex , but are brighter relative to the 54 line , consistent with higher excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest hc@xmath0n emission is located in the northern arm of the nuclear minispiral , 100 pc away from the radio / ir source to the southwest of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this location appears less affected by ultraviolet radiation , and may represent a more embedded , earlier stage of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> excitation temperatures are consistent with those determined from c@xmath1o ; the gas is dense , @xmath2 and cool , t@xmath3 k. so as to not violate limits on the total h@xmath4 mass determined from c@xmath1o , at least two dense components are required to model ic 342 s giant molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest that hc@xmath0n(54 ) is an excellent probe of the dense , quiescent gas in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the high excitation combined with faint emission towards the dense molecular gas at the starburst indicates that it currently lacks large masses of very dense gas . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a scenario where the starburst is being caught in the act of dispersing or destroying its dense gas in the presence of the large hii region . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the high star formation efficiency seen in the dense component . </S>",
