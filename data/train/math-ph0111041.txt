    "in the introductory paragraph of their recent interesting letter , sjqvist _ et al _ state that `` uhlmann was probably the first to address the issue of mixed state holonomy , but as a _ purely mathematical _",
    "( emphasis added ) problem .",
    "in contrast , here we provide a new formalism of the geometric phase for mixed states in the _ experimental _",
    "( emphasis added ) context of quantum interferometry '' @xcite . left unaddressed there , however , was the nature of any possible relationship between the two approaches .",
    "this question merits particular attention since dittmann has `` shown that the connection form ( gauge field ) related to the generalization of the berry phase to mixed states proposed by uhlmann satisfies the source - free yang - mills equation @xmath0 , where the hodge operator is taken with respect to the bures metric on the space of finite - dimensional nondegenerate density matrices '' @xcite .",
    "this fact , dittmann and uhlmann noted , `` may be seen as an extension to mixed states of numerous examples relating the original berry phase to dirac monopoles , and the wilczek and zee phase , to instantons '' @xcite . in their work ,",
    "et al _ do express the geometric phase in terms of an _ average _ connection form ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 16 ) ) ( for which no yang - mills characterization has been given ) .",
    "zee has reported that the non - abelian gauge structure associated with nuclear quadrupole resonance does _ not _ satisfy the source - free yang - mills equation @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in @xcite , in line with certain work of figueroa - ofarrill concerning calibrated geometries @xcite , we have begun a study of the `` dittmann - bures / yang - mills '' field over the _",
    "eight_-dimensional convex set of _",
    "three_-level density matrices ( making use of the formulas for the bures metric developed in @xcite , based on the parameterization in @xcite ) by finding certain self - dual _ four_-forms ( @xmath1 ) with respect to the bures metric . the eigenspace decomposition of the associated endomorphism @xmath2 was found to yield four octets and three singlets as factors @xcite .",
    "the research presented below represents our effort to gain a formal understanding of the relations between the `` mathematical '' methodology of uhlmann and the `` experimental '' approach of sjqvist _",
    "et al_. we hope that this will prove useful , among other things , in the devising of a physical scheme for implementing the concepts of uhlmann ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the interferometric / experimental case @xcite , each pure state that diagonalizes",
    "the initial density matrix ( @xmath3 ) is parallel transported separately from other distinct diagonalizing pure states , so one simply weights or ( incoherently ) averages the individual pure state ( single - state ) interference profiles by the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath3 to obtain the mixed state results . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "the _ total _ geometric phase is the argument of @xmath4 , and the visibility is its absolute value , where @xmath5 are , respectively , the eigenvalue , visibility and geometric phase obtained for the @xmath6-th constituent pure state of @xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 10 ) , ( 15 ) ) .",
    "the phase introduced by sjqvist _ et al _ `` fulfills two central properties that make it a natural generalization of the pure state case : ( i ) it gives rise to a linear shift of the interference oscillations produced by a variable @xmath7 phase and ( ii ) it reduces to the pancharatnam connection for pure states '' @xcite .",

    "@xcite the parallel transport takes place in a larger hilbert space , defined by purification . the geometric phase of sjqvist _",
    "et al _ can also be understood using purification @xcite , though the unitary operator that acts on the ancilla or auxiliary state there is unconstrained and can in fact be anything , such as the identity operator .",
    "a  parallel transport of a density operator amounts to a parallel transport of _ any _ ( emphasis added ) of it purifications @xcite .    in infinitesimal form",
    ", the parallelity condition of uhlmann for a density matrix @xmath8 reads ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 19 ) ) , @xmath12 where @xmath13 . the unitary operator @xmath14 can be interpreted as acting on the ancilla in the purification of @xmath8 and is determined by this parallelity condition ( [ w1 ] ) . for example , if the system , initially in the state @xmath3 , evolves unitarily under the evolution operator @xmath15 one may write @xmath16 . the uhlmann parallelity condition , then , reads @xmath17 with given input @xmath3 and @xmath15 this equation needs to be solved for @xmath14 .",
    "the geometric phase @xmath18 for any specific @xmath19 can then be computed using the mixed state pancharatnam connection @xcite , @xmath20    in the three sets of analyses reported below ( sec .",
    "ii ) , we will implement certain formulas of uhlmann @xcite .",
    "we compare the two methodologies under consideration in the context of : ( a ) unitary evolution over geodesic spherical _ triangles _ , the vertices of which are associated with certain specific _ mixed _ two - level systems ; ( b ) unitary evolution of such two - level systems over certain circular paths ( @xmath21-orbits ) ; and ( c ) unitary evolution over such circular paths of @xmath6-level gibbsian density matrices @xcite . in case ( a )",
    "we find an interesting correspondence between the two approaches for mixed states having bloch vectors of length @xmath22 and in ( c ) that the results of the uhlmann methodology converge to those of sjqvist _",
    "et al _ if a certain variable ( a ) , a function ( @xmath23 ) of the inverse temperature parameter ( @xmath24 ) , is driven to zero .",
    "if instead of strictly mixed states , we consider the unitary evolution of _ pure _ states , then both methodologies simply reproduce the corresponding berry phase for each of the three scenarios .",
    "however , for general mixed states , the two methodologies typically yield inequivalent results .",

    "we utilize the analyses of uhlmann in @xcite .",
    "again , we start with an initial density matrix @xmath3 , the bloch vector of which is proportional to ( 0,0,1 ) , while the axis of rotation about which the state evolves is @xmath96 .",

    "we have the relation @xmath103 the associated holonomy invariant for a complete rotation about @xmath104 is @xmath105 ( in @xcite , we have studied certain `` higher - order '' holonomy invariants . )",
    "we then have the result ( using the `` @xmath106 '' notation now , rather than `` @xmath107 '' as before , to refer to results obtained based on the unitary circular evolution analysis of uhlmann @xcite ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 we plot this ratio ( [ par1 ] ) in fig .  [ lb ] .",
    "now for @xmath111 , @xmath112 for pure states ( @xmath71 ) , the ratio ( [ par1 ] ) reduces to 1 . the ratio of the visibilities , @xmath113 is given in fig .  [ lc ] .",
    "both the ratios ( [ par1 ] ) and ( [ par2 ] ) are unity for pure states ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "in the final part of the paper @xcite , uhlmann also considered the analogous unitary circular evolution ( @xmath21-orbits ) of @xmath6-level gibbsian states of the form @xmath114 where the vector @xmath115 of angular momentum operators lives in @xmath6-dimensions .",
    "( for @xmath116 , the model is equivalent to that studied in the previous section . ) in @xcite we have conducted a detailed analysis of this model in comparison with the results that would be obtained implementing the methodology of sjqvist _",
    "et al_. one unanticipated outcome was that the sjqvist _",
    "et al _ model appeared sensitive to the bosonic ( odd @xmath6 ) or fermionic ( even @xmath6 ) nature of the @xmath6-level systems .",
    "as an example of this phenomenon , we exhibit two additional plots ( fig .",
    "[ p1 ] and [ p2 ] ) based on analyses for @xmath117 . in each of these plots , the inverse temperature parameter @xmath24 is held fixed at 2 . in fig .",
    "[ p1 ] , based on the uhlmann methodology , below @xmath118 the ten curves are all monotonically decreasing .",
    "the order of dominance among themselves of these curves is the natural order @xmath117 , with the curve for @xmath116 being the dominant one . on the other hand , using the procedure of sjqvist _",
    "et al _ , the ten corresponding curves are separated into two clusters of five ( below @xmath119 ) ( fig .",
    "[ p1 ] ) . in the first cluster (",
    "having the higher values of @xmath120 ) in decreasing order of dominance the five curves correspond to @xmath121 , while in the second group ( having lesser values ) the order is @xmath122 .",
    "( for other related figures , see @xcite . )",
    "[ y3 ]    also , we have found @xcite that the ( first - order ) holonomy invariant in the uhlmann approach ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 33 ) , ( 43 ) , ( 47 ) ) , that is the trace of @xmath123 reduces to @xmath124 times the holonomy invariant ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 15 ) ) in the sjqvist _",
    "et al _ analysis if we simply set the parameter @xmath125 in ( [ q1 ] ) to zero , that is the influence of the angular momentum operator @xmath126 is nullified .",
    "relatedly , if @xmath3 were the density matrix of a _ pure _ state , then the term @xmath127 in the invariant ( [ q1 ] ) would drop out , with the trace of the resultant expression being the corresponding berry phase ( * ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 43 ) ) .",
    "this fact was employed in @xcite to compute the sjqvist _",
    "et al _ mixed state holonomy for the @xmath6-level gibbsian density matrices , by taking the average ( using the eigenvalues of @xmath3 as weights ) of these berry phases for the pure states that diagonalize the initial density matrix ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 10 ) , ( 15 ) ) .",
    "the analyses presented above clearly demonstrate a general inequivalence between the `` experimental '' approach to mixed state holonomy of sjqvist _",
    "et al _ @xcite and the `` purely mathematical '' scheme of uhlmann @xcite . in particular , in the third of our analyses ( sec .",
    "[ ig ] ) , concerned with @xmath21-orbits of @xmath6-level gibbsian density matrices , it has emerged that the analyses of sjqvist _",
    "et al _ ( fig .  [ p2 ] ) are sensitive to the parity of @xmath6 , while those of uhlmann ( fig .",

    "a problem that remains to be fully addressed is the conceptualization of a physical apparatus that would yield the geometric phases and visibilities given by the analyses of uhlmann @xcite . in their study @xcite , sjqvist _",

    "however , they did not specify such a physical scheme for their conceptual alternative based on a purification procedure ( cf .",

    "let us also note that the connection used for parallel transport in the uhlmann ( bures ) case is but one of an ( uncountable ) infinite set of connections ( `` defining reasonable parallel transports along curves of density operators '' ) , which correspond in a one - to - one fashion , with the _ monotone _ metrics on the @xmath6-level density matrices , and are all compatible with the purification procedure @xcite . in this generalized framework",

    "a yet apparently formally unsettled question is whether or not the sjqvist _",
