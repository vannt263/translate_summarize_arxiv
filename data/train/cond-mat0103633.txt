    "the exact functional rg yields an infinite hierarchy of coupled differential equations describing the change of the correlation functions due to the elimination and the rescaling of the degrees of freedom . for classical statistical mechanics problems",

    "3 .   rescale the remaining fields by a factor of @xmath6 , where the anomalous dimension @xmath7 has to be chosen such that the rg has a fixed point @xcite .    over the years",
    "several alternative formulations of the exact functional rg in field theory and statistical physics have been proposed @xcite .",
    "note , however , that recent applications of the exact rg for two - dimensional fermions @xcite take only the mode elimination step 1 into account , and do not perform the above rescaling steps 2 and 3 .",
    "while such a procedure is legitimate if one is interested in solving a given many - body problem iteratively , the wilsonian rg amounts to more than that @xcite : by combining the mode elimination with a suitable rescaling of the degrees of freedom , the wilsonian rg generates a mapping of the original many - body problem onto a continuous family of new many - body problems , labeled by a flow parameter @xmath8 . in the limit @xmath9",
    "it sometimes happens that the resulting problem simplifies and can be solved in a controlled manner . in order to obtain a non - trivial rg fixed point for @xmath9 which is characterized by a non - zero anomalous dimension @xmath7 , it is crucial that the fields are properly rescaled , as discussed in detail by bell and wilson @xcite .",
    "for example , by applying the exact functional rg to @xmath10-theory @xcite , it is easy to see that without the rescaling the rg flow does not reproduce the wilson - fisher fixed point below four dimensions , see sec.[subsec : wilson ] .",
    "we therefore believe that the rg calculations of refs.@xcite are incomplete , and should be augmented by the usual rescaling steps 2 and 3 given above .",
    "note that the rescaling is explicitly included in the one loop momentum - shell approach advanced by shankar@xcite , so that one may wonder why the exact functional rg used in refs.@xcite does not include the rescaling .",

    "this is not necessarily true , however , because even at the one - loop level the rescaling of momenta and frequencies ( see step 2 in sec.[sec : intro ] ) can be essential to obtain a non - trivial rg fixed point .",

    "this @xmath279 appears as the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([eq : sixpointscale ] ) , and causes the size of the rescaled six - point vertex to diminish exponentially as we iterate the rg ( as long as this decrease is not overwhelmed by some anomalous dimension ) .",
