    "core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) are the explosions of massive stars at the end of their lives . besides their importance",
    "as the end points of stellar evolution , sne play an important role on chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies .",
    "however , the explosion mechanism of sne has been unclear for a long time after the first concept by @xcite and the first numerical simulation by @xcite .",
    "modern detailed numerical simulations agree in that a successful explosion can not be obtained in one - dimensional simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , more and more attention is being paid to multi - dimensional effects , such as convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and standing accretion shock instability ( sasi , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , some successful explosions have been obtained in two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations @xcite .",
    "thanks to the advance of numerical simulations , some simulations have been done in fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) space @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite show that it is easier to obtain a successful explosion in 3d simulation than in 2d simulations ( but see also * ? ? ? * ) .    given these circumstances",
    ", it is important to obtain observational constraints on the multi - dimensional geometry of sn explosions . the most direct way is the observation of spatially resolved supernovae . @xcite and",
    "@xcite performed detailed observations of galactic supernova remnant cassiopeia a. using a combination of imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy , they reconstructed the 3d geometry of the sn . similarly , direct imaging @xcite and spatially resolved spectroscopy @xcite have been performed for sn 1987a in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "however , the number of objects suitable for such observations is limited .",
    "observations of extragalactic sne can also provide hints of explosion geometry , although at this distance sne are point sources .",
    "for example , spectroscopic observations of sne at @xmath11 yr after the explosion provide information of explosion geometry . at such late epochs ,",
    "sn ejecta are optically thin .",
    "therefore , this method is sensitive to the geometry of the innermost ejecta . by analyzing line profiles of nebular emission , bipolar geometry of sne",
    "has been suggested ( e.g. , @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "polarization at early phases ( @xmath2 50 d after the explosion ) is another powerful method to study the multi - dimensional geometry of extragalactic sne ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "in contrast to late phase spectroscopy , polarization is sensitive to the geometry of the outer ejecta .",
    "in particular , spectropolarimetry can probe 3d geometry , as explained in the following section . in this paper",
    ", we study the multi - dimensional explosion geometry of sne using spectropolarimetric observations .      ]",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      it is clear that there is a remaining dispersion in the line polarization among different objects even after the correction for the absorption depth ( right panel in figure [ fig : pobs_sn ] ) .",
    "we first examine if the corrected polarization is related with the epoch .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : pcor ] shows the corrected line polarization as a function of epoch .",
    "although there is a weak trend that the polarization decreases with time , it is not clear if all the variety in the corrected polarization can be explained by the effect of the epoch .",
    "the remaining dispersion could also be understood by the multi - dimensional properties of each sn .",
    "it is thus worth studying a relation between the line polarization and the [ ] line profile in the nebular spectra , which is another geometric probe of the sn ejecta @xcite .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : pcor ] shows the relation between corrected line polarization and the [ ] line profile .",
    "sne 2002ap and 2007gr show a single - peak profile @xcite while sne 2005bf and 2008d show a double - peak profile @xcite .",
    "the [ ] profile of sn 2009jf is complex ; it shows both single- and double - peak components @xcite . following the classification by @xcite ,",
    "we classify it as `` transition '' . only with five objects , it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "it is therefore important to increase spectropolarimetric samples to further study this relation .",
    "the dispersion may also reflect a difference between type ib and ic .",
    "in fact , 3 type ic sne in our sample tend to have lower polarization degree than 3 type ib sne ( left panel of figure [ fig : pobs_sn ] ) . by increasing the number of samples",
    ", we will be able to study the effect of the existence of the he envelope on the explosion geometry .",
    "one natural scenario is that the dispersion is caused by random line - of - sight effects .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : results ] , stripped - envelope sne generally have 3d geometry .",
    "if we assume a clumpy structure as in the left bottom panel in figure [ fig : intro_sim ] , a variety of polarization is naturally expected for different line - of - sight . since the effect of the",
    "line - of - sight is very sensitive to the size and the number of clumps , it can be used as an observational probe to study a typical 3d geometry of sne .",
    "this will be further studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have performed spectropolarimetric observations of 2 stripped - envelope sne , type ib sn 2009jf and type ic sn 2009mi .",
    "both objects show non - zero line polarization at the wavelength of strong absorption lines .",
    "the polarization data show a `` loop '' in the @xmath0 diagram , which indicates a non - axisymmetric , 3d distribution of ions in the sn ejecta . after adding our new data to the sample of stripped - envelope sne with high - quality spectropolarimetric observations , five sne out of six",
    "show a loop in the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "we conclude that a non - axisymmetric , 3d geometry is common in stripped - envelope sne .",
    "we have studied the properties of line polarization in stripped - envelope sne .",
    "we have found that a stronger line tends to show a higher polarization .",
    "we give an analytic equation that naturally explains this relation .",
    "although the line usually shows a higher line polarization than the other lines , it is not always true after the correction of the absorption depth .",
    "this effect must be corrected in order to compare the polarization of different lines or different objects .",
    "even after the correction for the absorption depth , there is a dispersion in the polarization degree among different objects .",
    "this dispersion could simply reflect the epoch of the observations .",
    "it might also be related to the [ ] line profile in the nebular spectra or sn types ( type ib or ic ) , although it is not possible to draw any firm conclusion with the current sample . also , if we assume a 3d clumpy structure , the variety is naturally expected by the line - of - sight effect .",
    "modeling of spectropolarimetric data will be performed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we are grateful to the staff and observers of the subaru telescope , especially masahiko hayashi and hiroshi terada for their effort on the time allocation of our too observations in 2009 .",
    "mt thanks yudai suwa and takami kuroda for valuable comments .",
