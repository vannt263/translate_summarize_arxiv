    "the signals from a process of interest are often contaminated by signals from extraneous processes , which are thought to be statistically independent of the process of interest but are otherwise unknown .",
    "this raises the question : can one use the observed signals to determine if two or more independent processes are present , and , if so , can one derive a representation of the evolution of each of them ?",
    "in other words , if a system is effectively evolving in a closed box , can one process the signals emanating from the box in order to learn the number and nature of the subsystems within it ?",
    "there is a variety of methods for solving this blind source separation ( bss ) problem for the special case in which the signals are linearly related to the underlying independent subsystem states ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , some observed signals ( e.g. , from biological or economic systems ) may be nonlinear functions of the underlying system states .",
    "computational methods of separating such nonlinear mixtures are limited ( @xcite , @xcite ) , even though humans seem to do it in an effortless manner .",
    "consider an evolving physical system that is being observed by making time - dependent measurements ( @xmath3 where @xmath4 ) , which are coordinates on the system s state space . in conclusion , we describe how to choose measurements that comprise such coordinates .",
    "the objective of blind source separation is to determine if the measurement time series is separable ; i.e. , to determine if it can be transformed into another coordinate system , @xmath5 ( called the `` source '' or `` separable '' coordinate system ) , in which the transformed time series describes the evolution of statistically independent subsystems .",
    "specifically , we want to know if there is an invertible , possibly nonlinear , @xmath6 `` unmixing '' function , @xmath7 , that transforms the measurement time series into a source time series : @xmath8 , \\ ] ] where the @xmath9 components of @xmath10 can be partitioned into statistically independent , possibly multidimensional groups .",
    "this paper utilizes a criterion for `` statistical independence ''  @xcite that differs from the conventional one .",
    "specifically , let @xmath11 be the probability density function ( pdf ) in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "namely , let @xmath14 be the fraction of total time that the location and velocity of @xmath10 are within the volume element @xmath15 at location @xmath16 . in this paper ,",
    "the data are defined to be separable if and only if there is an unmixing function that transforms the measurements so that @xmath11 is the product of the density functions of individual components ( or groups of components ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a subsystem state variable , comprised of one or more of the components of @xmath5 .",
    "this criterion for separability is consistent with our intuition that the statistical distribution of the state and velocity of any independent subsystem should not depend on the particular state and velocity of any other independent subsystem .",
    "this criterion for statistical independence should be compared to the conventional criterion , which is formulated in @xmath19 ( i.e. , state space ) instead of @xmath12 ( the space of states and state velocities ) .",
    "in particular , let @xmath20 be the pdf , defined so that @xmath21 is the fraction of total time that the trajectory @xmath10 is located within the volume element @xmath22 at location @xmath5 . in some formulations of the bss problem ,",
    "the system is said to be separable if and only if there is an unmixing function that transforms the measurements so that @xmath20 is the product of the density functions of individual components ( or groups of components ) @xmath23 in _ every _ formulation of bss , multiple solutions can be created by applying `` subsystem - wise '' transformations , which transform each subsystem s components among themselves .",
    "these solutions are the same as one another , except for differing choices of the coordinate systems used to describe each subsystem . however , the criterion in ( [ state space factorization ] ) is so weak that it suffers from a much worse non - uniqueness problem : namely , solutions can almost always be created by mixing the state variables of _ different _ subsystems of other solutions ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there are at least two reasons why ( [ phase space factorization ] ) is the preferred way of defining `` statistical independence '' :    1 .",
    "if a physical system is comprised of two independent subsystems , we normally expect that there is a unique way of identifying the subsystems .",
    "as mentioned above , ( [ state space factorization ] ) is too weak to meet this expectation . on the other hand , ( [ phase space factorization ] )",
    "is a much stronger constraint than ( [ state space factorization ] ) . specifically , ( [ state space factorization ] ) can be recovered by integrating both sides of ( [ phase space factorization ] ) with respect to velocity .",
    "this shows that the solutions of ( [ phase space factorization ] ) are a subset of the solutions of ( [ state space factorization ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is certainly possible that ( [ phase space factorization ] ) reformulates the bss problem so that it has a unique solution ( up to subsystem - wise transformations ) , although this is not proved in this paper .",
    "2 .   for all systems that obey the laws of classical physics and are in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath24 ,",
    "the pdf in @xmath12 is proportional to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the system s energy and @xmath27 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "if the system consists of two non - interacting subsystems , the system s energy is the sum of the subsystem energies @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are subsystem state variables comprised of one or more components of @xmath5 .",
    "this demonstrates that , for all classical systems composed of non - interacting subsystems , the system s pdf in @xmath12 is the product of the subsystem pdfs in @xmath12 , as stated in ( [ phase space factorization ] ) .",
    "there are several other ways in which the proposed method of nonlinear bss differs from methods in the literature :    1 .",
    "as stated above , in this paper the bss problem is reformulated in the joint space of states and state velocities .",
    "although there is some earlier work in which bss is performed with the aid of velocity information ( @xcite , @xcite ) , these papers utilize the _ global _ distribution of measurement velocities ( i.e. , the distribution of velocities at all points in state space ) . in contrast",
    ", the method proposed here exploits additional information that is present in the _ local _ distributions of measurement velocities ( i.e. , the velocity distributions in each neighborhood of state space ) .",
    "many investigators have attempted to simplify the bss problem by assuming prior knowledge of the nature of the mixing function ; i.e. , they have modelled the mixing function .",
    "for example , the mixing function has been assumed to have parametric forms that describe post - nonlinear mixtures @xcite , linear - quadratic mixtures @xcite , and other combinations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the present paper proposes a model - independent method that can be used in the presence of any invertible diffeomorphic mixing function .",
    "3 .   in many other approaches ,",
    "nonlinear bss is reduced to the optimization problem of finding the unmixing function that maximizes the independence of the source signals corresponding to the observed mixtures .",
    "this usually requires the use of iterative algorithms with attendant issues of convergence and computational cost ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the method proposed in this paper is analytic and constructive .",
    "specifically , the observed data are used to construct a small collection of mappings , @xmath31 , that must contain an unmixing function , if one exists . to perform bss",
    ", it then suffices to determine if any of these functions transforms the measured time series , @xmath0 , into a time series , @xmath32 $ ] , having a factorizable pdf .",
    "the data are separable if and only if this is the case .",
    "there are two earlier papers ( @xcite , @xcite ) that utilize the criterion in ( [ phase space factorization ] ) in order to perform nonlinear bss . however , both of these approaches are quite different from the one proposed here .",
    "the current paper shows how the measurement time series endows state space with local vectors that contain crucial information about the separability of the data .",
    "specifically , if the data are separable , each of these vectors must be directed along a subspace of @xmath2 that is traversed by varying the state variable of one subsystem , while all other subsystem variables are kept constant .",
    "because of this property , these vectors can be used to determine if the data are separable and , if they are , to determine the transformation to a separable coordinate system .",
    "in contrast , the presence of these vectors played no role whatsoever in the methods discussed in @xcite and @xcite . instead ,    1 .   in @xcite ,",
    "bss was performed by deriving a large number of local scalars that must lie in low - dimensional subspaces , if the data were separable .",
    "the vectorial structure on state space was not utilized or even recognized .",
    "2 .   likewise",
    ", local vectors also played no role in @xcite .",
    "instead , the local second - order velocity correlation matrix was taken to define a riemannian metric on the space of measurements ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "then , nonlinear bss was performed by using differential geometry to look for a transformation to another coordinate system ( @xmath5 ) , in which this metric was block - diagonal everywhere .    in short , although @xcite , @xcite , and the present paper all utilize the same criterion for statistical independence ( i.e. , ( [ phase space factorization ] ) ) , these three approaches differ greatly in how they determine whether this criterion is satisfied by a given signal .",
    "the next section gives a detailed description of the proposed method of nonlinear blind source separation , which is schematically illustrated in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "section  [ experiments ] illustrates the method by using it to blindly recover the utterances of two speakers from nonlinear mixtures of their audio waveforms .",
    "the last section discusses the implications of this approach .",
    "note that brief versions of this work were presented in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "for didactic purposes , the next subsection describes a five - step procedure for performing nonlinear bss of systems with two degrees of freedom .",
    "then , subsection [ n dimensional systems ] describes how to generalize this procedure so that it can be applied to systems and subsystems having any number of degrees of freedom .      _",
    "1 . the local second- and fourth - order correlations of the measurement velocity ( @xmath33 ) are computed in small neighborhoods of the measurement space .",
    "these correlations are used to compute two local vectors ( @xmath34 ) _ + the first step is to construct second - order and fourth - order local correlations of the data s velocity @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 , where the bracket denotes the time average over the trajectory s segments in a small neighborhood of @xmath1 , and where all subscripts are integers equal to @xmath38 or @xmath39 . because @xmath33 is a contravariant vector , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are local contravariant tensors of rank @xmath39 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the definition of the pdf implies that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two of its moments ; e.g. , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the pdf in the @xmath1 coordinate system , where `` @xmath45 '' denotes possible additional subscripts on the left side and corresponding additional factors of @xmath46 on the right side , and where all subscripts are integers equal to @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "although ( [ pdf moment ] ) is useful in a formal sense , in practical applications all required correlation functions can be computed directly from local time averages of the data ( e.g. , ( [ c2 definition])-([c4 definition ] ) ) , without explicitly computing the data s pdf . also , note that velocity `` correlations '' with a single subscript vanish identically @xmath47    next , let @xmath48 be any local @xmath49 matrix , and use it to define @xmath50 velocity correlations , @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 because @xmath40 is generically positive definite , it is possible to find a particular form of @xmath48 that satisfies @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a diagonal @xmath49 matrix .",
    "such an @xmath48 can be constructed from the product of three matrices : 1 ) a rotation that diagonalizes @xmath40 , 2 ) a diagonal rescaling matrix that transforms this diagonalized correlation into the identity matrix , 3 ) another rotation that diagonalizes @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fourth - order velocity correlation ( @xmath41 ) after it has been transformed by the first rotation and the rescaling matrix .",
    "as long as @xmath60 is not degenerate , @xmath48 is unique , up to arbitrary _ local _ permutations and/or reflections . in almost all applications of interest",
    ", the velocity correlations will be continuous functions of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in any neighborhood of state space , there will always be a continuous solution for @xmath48 , and this solution is unique , up to arbitrary _",

    "this can be proven by substituting this equation into the definition of @xmath66 and @xmath67 and by noting that these quantities satisfy ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) in the @xmath61 coordinate system because ( [ i2 definition])-([i4 definition ] ) satisfy them in the @xmath1 coordinate system . by construction",
    ", @xmath64 is not singular , and , therefore , it has a non - singular inverse .",
    "notice that ( [ m ] ) shows that the rows of @xmath64 transform as local covariant vectors , up to global permutations and/or reflections .",
    "likewise , the same equation implies that the columns of @xmath68 transform as local contravariant vectors ( denoted as @xmath69 ) , up to global permutations and/or reflections .",
    "as shown in the following , these particular vectors contain significant information about the separability of the data .",
    "in fact , they can be used to construct a mapping that must be an unmixing function , if one exists . + _ 2 .",

    "however , to analyze systems with more than two degrees of freedom , a small set of mappings , @xmath31 , must be constructed , as suggested in figure [ figure1 ] and as described in detail in subsection [ n dimensional systems ] .",
    "working in the @xmath1 coordinate system , we begin by picking any point @xmath73 .",
    "we then find a curve @xmath74 that passes through @xmath73 and is tangential to the local vector @xmath75 at each point . here",

    "mathematically , @xmath79 can be chosen to be a solution of @xmath82 that satisfies the boundary condition , @xmath83 .",
    "finally , the function @xmath84 is defined so that it is constant along each of the @xmath85 curves . specifically , @xmath86 whenever @xmath1 is on the @xmath85 curve passing through @xmath74",

    "this can be proved by demonstrating that @xmath94 satisfies ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) in the @xmath5 coordinate system .",
    "to do this , first note that ( [ pdf moment ] ) , ( [ phase space factorization ] ) , and ( [ c_k=0 ] ) imply that the second - order velocity correlations are diagonal in the @xmath5 coordinate system .",
    "it follows that ( [ m definition 1 ] ) is satisfied by @xmath94 in the @xmath5 coordinate system .",
    "furthermore , it is not difficult to show that ( [ m definition 2 ] ) is also satisfied by @xmath94 in the @xmath5 coordinate system . to see this , substitute ( [ diagonal ms ] ) into the sum on the left side of ( [ m definition 2 ] ) for @xmath95 . because of the diagonality of @xmath94 , each term in this summation is proportional to a fourth - order velocity correlation in the @xmath5 coordinate system that has just one index equal to @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) and the other three indices all equal to @xmath39 ( or @xmath38 ) . each of these terms must vanish because of ( [ pdf moment ] ) , ( [ phase space factorization ] ) , and ( [ c_k=0 ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof that @xmath94 satisfies both ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) in the @xmath5 coordinate system , and , therefore , it is the @xmath64 matrix in the @xmath5 coordinate system , as asserted above .",
    "because @xmath94 is diagonal , the local vectors in the @xmath5 coordinate system , denoted @xmath96 and @xmath97 , are oriented along the unit vectors , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath5 coordinate system , the curve , @xmath74 , which was used in the definition of @xmath84 , is a horizontal straight line passing through the point @xmath100 $ ] , similarly , each @xmath85 curve is a vertical straight line passing through @xmath101 $ ] for some value of @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that @xmath102 is constant along each @xmath85 curve , being equal to the value of @xmath103 at its intersection with the @xmath104 curve .",
    "but , recall that @xmath84 is also constant along each @xmath85 curve , being equal to the value of @xmath76 at its intersection with the @xmath104 curve . therefore , because @xmath76 is defined to vary monotonically along the @xmath104 curve and because the values of @xmath103 also vary monotonically along that curve , these paired values must be monotonically related to one another ; i.e. , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a monotonic function .",
    "it follows that @xmath84 and @xmath107 must also be monotonically related at each point ; i.e. , @xmath108 $ ] . in a similar manner",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath87 and @xmath109 are also related by some monotonic function .",
    "this means that @xmath84 and @xmath87 are component - wise transformations of @xmath107 and @xmath109 . because such component - wise transformations do not affect separability",

    ", ( [ phase space factorization ] ) , and ( [ c_k=0 ] ) imply that velocity correlations vanish in the @xmath5 coordinate system if their indices contain a solitary index from any one block .",
    "it follows that the second - order velocity correlation in the @xmath5 coordinate system ( @xmath92 ) consists of two blocks , each of which contains the second - order velocity correlations of an independent subsystem .",
    "this implies that ( [ block - diagonal ms ] ) satisfies the constraint ( [ m definition 1 ] ) , because , by definition , each block of @xmath94 transforms the corresponding block of @xmath144 into an identity matrix . in order to prove that ( [ block - diagonal ms ] ) satisfies ( [ m definition 2 ] ) , substitute it into the definition of @xmath145 then , note that : 1 ) when @xmath27 and @xmath146 belong to different blocks , each term in this sum vanishes because it factorizes into a product of correlations , one of which has a single index and , therefore , must vanish because of ( [ c_k=0 ] ) ; 2 ) when @xmath27 and @xmath146 belong to the same block and are unequal , each term with @xmath147 in any other block contains a factor equal to @xmath148 , which vanishes for @xmath149 , as proved above ; 3 ) when @xmath27 and @xmath146 belong to the same block and are unequal , the sum over @xmath147 in the same block vanishes , because each block of @xmath94 is defined to satisfy ( [ m definition 2 ] ) for the corresponding subsystem .",
    "this completes the proof that @xmath94 satisfies ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath94 is the @xmath64 matrix in the @xmath5 coordinate system , as asserted above .",
    "recall that the local vectors in the @xmath5 coordinate system are columns of the matrix , @xmath150 .",
    "because of the block diagonality of @xmath150 , the local vectors can be sorted into two groups ( groups @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) that consist of the columns passing through blocks @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , and that contain @xmath119 and @xmath120 vectors , respectively . therefore , at each point @xmath5 , the local vectors in the first group are linear combinations of the unit vectors parallel to the first @xmath119 axes of the @xmath5 coordinate system , and the local vectors in the second group are linear combinations of the unit vectors parallel to the last @xmath120 axes of the @xmath5 coordinate system .",
    "hence , in the @xmath5 coordinate system , the function , @xmath74 , which was used to define @xmath112 , describes the linear subspace that contains the point @xmath100 $ ] and that is spanned by the first group of unit vectors .",
    "likewise , each @xmath79 , which was used to define @xmath112 , describes a linear subspace that contains @xmath101 $ ] for some value of @xmath76 and that is spanned by the second group of unit vectors .",
    "this implies that the state variable of the first subsystem , @xmath151 , is constant within each @xmath85 subspace , being equal to the value of @xmath151 at the intersection of that @xmath85 subspace with the @xmath104 subspace .",
    "but , recall that @xmath112 is also constant within each @xmath85 subspace , being equal to the value of @xmath76 at its intersection with the @xmath104 subspace . therefore , because @xmath76 is defined to be invertibly related to the points in the @xmath104 subspace and because the values of @xmath29 are also invertibly related to the points in the @xmath104 subspace , these paired values must be invertibly related to one another ; i.e. , @xmath152 where @xmath106 is an invertible function .",
    "it follows that @xmath112 and @xmath151 must also be invertibly related at each point ; i.e. , @xmath153 $ ] . in a similar manner",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath113 and @xmath154 are also related by some invertible function .",
    "because @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the state variables of independent subsystems and because @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , are invertibly related to them , @xmath139 and @xmath140 must be subsystem state variables in some other subsystem coordinate systems .",
    "this completes the proof of the assertion at the beginning of the previous paragraph : namely , if the data are separable , at least one way of grouping the local vectors ( e.g. , the grouping corresponding to the above - mentioned blocks ) leads to a mapping , @xmath72 , that describes a pair of statistically independent state variables ( @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) .",
    "in this section , the new bss technique is illustrated by using it to disentangle synthetic nonlinear mixtures of two audio waveforms .",
    "the audio waveforms consisted of two thirty - second excerpts from audio books , each one read by a different male speaker .",
    "the waveform of each speaker , denoted @xmath155 for @xmath156 , was sampled 16,000 times per second with two bytes of depth .",
    "the thick gray lines in figure [ figure2 ] show the two speakers waveforms during a short ( 30 ms ) interval .",
    "these waveforms were then mixed by the nonlinear functions @xmath157 where @xmath158 .",
    "this is one of a variety of nonlinear transformations that were tried with similar results .",
    "the synthetic mixture measurements , @xmath159 , were taken to be the variance - normalized , principal components of the sampled waveform mixtures , @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig_warped_grid ] shows how this nonlinear mixing mapped an evenly - spaced cartesian grid in the @xmath5 coordinate system onto a warped grid in the @xmath1 coordinate system .",
    "figure [ fig_measurements ] shows the distribution of the synthetic measurements created by randomly sampling @xmath0 , and figure [ figure4 ] shows the time course of @xmath0 during the same short time interval depicted in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "when either waveform mixture ( @xmath161 or @xmath162 ) was played as an audio file , it sounded like a confusing superposition of two voices , which were quite difficult to understand .",
    "the proposed bss technique was then applied to these synthetic measurements as follows :    1 .",
    "the entire set of 500,000 measurements , consisting of @xmath1 and @xmath33 at each sampled time , was sorted into a @xmath163 array of bins in @xmath2 .",
    "then , the @xmath33 distribution in each bin was used to compute local velocity correlations ( see ( [ c2 definition ] ) and ( [ c4 definition ] ) ) , and these were used to derive @xmath64 and @xmath114 for each bin .",
    "figure [ fig_v ] shows these local vectors at each point .",
    "2 .   these vectors were used to construct the mapping , @xmath72 . as described in method , the first step was to choose some point @xmath73 and then construct the curvilinear line , @xmath74 , that passes through that point and is tangential to the local vector @xmath75 everywhere .",
    "then , at each point @xmath76 on this curve , a curvilinear line , @xmath79 , was constructed through it so that it was tangential to the local vector @xmath80 everywhere . along each of these @xmath85 curves , @xmath84 was defined to be a constant equal to the value of @xmath76 at the curve s point of intersection with @xmath74 .",
    "the mapping , @xmath87 , was defined by an analogous procedure . in this way , each point @xmath1 was assigned values of both @xmath164 and @xmath165 , thereby defining the mapping , @xmath72 .",
    "one of the groups of thin black lines in figure [ fig_warped_grid ] depicts a family of curves having constant values of @xmath166 , which are evenly - spaced and increase as one moves from curve to curve in the family .",
    "the other group of thin black lines in figure [ fig_warped_grid ] shows a family of curves having constant values of @xmath167 , which are evenly - spaced and increase as one moves from curve to curve in the family .",
    "as proved in method , if the data are separable , @xmath72 must an unmixing function .",
    "therefore , the separability of the data could be determined by seeing if @xmath32 $ ] has a factorizable density function ( or factorizable correlation functions ) .",
    "if the density function does factorize , the data are patently separable , and @xmath168 $ ] and @xmath169 $ ] describe the evolution of the independent subsystems . on the other hand , if the density function does not factorize , the data must be inseparable .    in this illustrative example ,",
    "the separability of the @xmath89 coordinate system was verified by a more direct method .",
    "specifically , figure [ fig_warped_grid ] shows that the isoclines for increasing values of @xmath166 ( or @xmath167 ) nearly coincide with the isoclines for increasing values of @xmath103 ( or @xmath170 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the @xmath89 and @xmath5 coordinate systems differ by component - wise transformations of the form : @xmath171 where @xmath106 and @xmath172 are monotonic functions . because the data are separable in the @xmath5",
    "coordinate system and because component - wise transformations do not affect separability , the data s pdf must factorize in the @xmath89 coordinate system .",
    "therefore , we have accomplished the objectives of bss : namely , by blindly processing the mixture measurements , @xmath0 , we have determined that the system is separable , and we have computed the transformation , @xmath72 , to a separable coordinate system .    the transformation , @xmath72 , can be applied to the mixture measurements , @xmath0 , to recover the original unmixed waveforms , up to component - wise transformations .",
    "the resulting waveforms , @xmath168 $ ] and @xmath169 $ ] , are depicted by the thin black lines in figure [ figure2 ] , which also shows the trajectory of the unmixed waveforms in the @xmath5 coordinate system .",
    "notice that the two trajectories , @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath10 , are similar except for component - wise transformations along the two axes .",
    "a component - wise transformation is especially noticeable as a stretching of @xmath173 with respect to @xmath169 $ ] along the positive @xmath170 axis .",
    "when each of the recovered waveforms , @xmath168 $ ] and @xmath169 $ ] , was played as an audio file , it sounded like a completely intelligible recording of one of the speakers . in each case , the other speaker was not heard , except for a faint `` buzzing '' sound in the background .",
    "therefore , the component - wise transformations ( e.g. , the above - mentioned `` stretching '' ) , which related the recovered waveforms to the original unmixed waveforms , did not noticeably reduce intelligibility .",
    "this paper describes how to determine the separability of time - dependent measurements of a system , @xmath0 ; namely , it shows how to determine if there is a linear or nonlinear function ( an unmixing function ) that transforms the data into a collection of signals from statistically independent subsystems .",
    "first , the measurement time series is shown to endow state space with a local structure , consisting of vectors at each point @xmath1 .",
    "if the data are separable , each of these vectors is directed along a subspace traversed by varying the state variable of one subsystem , while all other subsystems are kept constant .",
    "because of this property , these vectors can be used to derive a small number of mappings , @xmath31 , which must include an unmixing function , if one exists . in other words ,",
    "the data are separable if and only if one of the @xmath72 describes a separable coordinate system .",
    "therefore , separability can be determined by testing the separability of the data , after they have been transformed by each of these mappings .      1 .",
    "the original problem of looking for an unmixing function , @xmath174 , among an _ infinite set of functions _ was reduced to the simpler problem of constructing a _ small number of mappings _ , @xmath31 , and then determining if one of them transforms the data into separable form . 2 .",
    "the bss method described in this paper is model - independent in the sense that it can be used to separate data that were mixed by any invertible diffeomorphic mixing function .",
    "in contrast , most other approaches to nonlinear bss are model - dependent because they assume that the mixing function has a specific parametric form ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "notice that the proposed method is analytic and constructive in the sense that the candidate unmixing functions are constructed directly from the data , by locally manipulating them with linear algebraic techniques .",
    "in contrast , many other approaches @xcite search for an unmixing function by utilizing more complex techniques , involving neural networks or iterative computations .",
    "theoretically , the proposed method can be applied to measurements described by any diffeomorphic mixing function . however",
    ", more data will have to be analyzed in order to handle mixing functions with more pronounced nonlinearities .",
    "this is because rapidly varying mixing functions may cause the local vectors ( @xmath114 ) to vary rapidly in the measurement coordinate system , making it necessary to compute those vectors in numerous small neighborhoods .",
    "5 .   more data will also be required to apply this method to systems with many degrees of freedom . in experiments ,",
    "thirty seconds of data ( 500,000 samples ) were used to recover two audio waveforms from measurements of two nonlinear mixtures . in other experiments , approximately six minutes of data ( 6,000,000 samples ) were used to cleanly recover the waveforms of four sound sources ( two speakers and two piano performances ) from four signal mixtures . as expected , blind separation for the 4d state space did require more data , but it was not a prohibitive amount . 6 .   the proposed method does not require unusual computational resources . in any event ,",
    "the most computationally expensive tasks are the binning of the measurement data and the computation of the local vectors , @xmath114 , in each bin . if necessary",
    ", these calculations can be parallelized across multiple cpus .",
    "this paper shows how to perform nonlinear bss for the case in which the mixture measurements are invertibly related to the state variables of the underlying system .",
    "invertibility can almost be guaranteed by observing the system with a sufficiently large number of independent sensors : specifically , by utilizing at least @xmath175 independent sensors , where @xmath9 is the dimension of the system s state space . in this case",
    ", the sensors output lies in an @xmath176 subspace embedded within a space of at least @xmath175 dimensions .",
    "dimensional reduction techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) can be used to find the subspace coordinates corresponding to the sensor outputs . because an embedding theorem asserts that this subspace is very unlikely to self - intersect @xcite , the coordinates on this subspace are almost certainly invertibly related to the system s state space , as desired .",
    "separability is an intrinsic or coordinate - system - independent property of data ; i.e. , if it is true ( or false ) in one coordinate system , it is true ( or false ) in all coordinate systems . the local vectors ( @xmath114 )",
    "also represent a kind of intrinsic structure on state space , and , as mentioned previously , these contain some information about separability , which is available in all coordinate systems .",
    "these vectors `` mark '' state space and are analogous to directional arrows , which mark a physical surface and which can be used as navigational aids , no matter what coordinate system is being used .",
    "many other vectors can be derived from the local velocity distributions of a time series .",
    "however , most of them will not have the special property of the @xmath114 : namely , the property of being aligned with the directions traversed by the system when just one subsystem is varied and all others are held constant . for example , the @xmath114 would not have this critical property if the definition of @xmath64 ( see ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) ) was changed by replacing @xmath177 with higher order correlations ( e.g. , @xmath178 ) .",
