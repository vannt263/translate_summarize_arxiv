    "so , for example , the gluing maps used to construct the manifolds @xmath4 above increase in complexity as @xmath8 increases .    a rough sketch of the proof of theorem [ t : distanceboundtheorem ] is as follows . in @xcite we showed that any topologically minimal surface @xmath18 can be isotoped to meet the gluing surface @xmath6 so that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are topologically minimal in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in section [ s : indexrelbdy ]",

    ". then the theorem asserts that if @xmath32 is glued to @xmath33 by a sufficiently complicated map , then any low genus , topologically minimal surface in the resulting 3-manifold is isotopic into @xmath0 .",
    "the index 0 , 1 , and 2 cases of theorem [ t : distanceboundtheorem ] play a central role in the two sequels to this paper , @xcite and @xcite . in these papers we answer a variety of questions dealing with stabilization and isotopy of heegaard surfaces .",
    "the first contains a construction of a pair of inequivalent heegaard splittings that require several stabilizations to become equivalent . in the second",
