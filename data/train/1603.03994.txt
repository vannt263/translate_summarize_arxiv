    "as is well known , the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation @xmath0 has been investigated deeply since the important work of zakharov and shabat @xcite . in physical fields ,",
    "the nls equation can characterize plenty of models in varies aspects , such as nonlinear optics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , deep water waves @xcite and in purely mathematics like motion of curves in differential geometry @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nls equation can be derived from the theory of deep water wave , and also from the maxwell equation .",
    "it should be noted that the nls equation is parity - time - symmetry ( pt - symmetry ) , which has becomed an interesting topic in quantum mechanics @xcite , optics @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite and quantum chromodynamics @xcite , etc .",
    "a nonlocal nls equation has been introduced by ablowitz and musslimani in @xcite : @xmath1 it can be yielded from the famous akns system . as the nls equation , the nonlocal nls equation is also pt - symmetric .",
    "it is an integrable system with the lax pair .",
    "ablowitz and musslimani gave its infinitely many conservation laws and solved it through the inverse scattering transformation @xcite .",
    ". has different properties from eq .",
    ", e.g. , eq . contains both bright and dark soliton @xcite and solutions with periodic singularities @xcite .",
    "very recently , motivated by the work of nonlocal nls equation due to ablowitz and musslimani , we proposed and investigated a nonlocal modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) equation in @xcite , @xmath2 its lax integrability , darboux transformation , and soliton solution have been discussed in our paper @xcite .",
    "we should remark here that the nonlocal mkdv equation also occurred in a paper of ablowitz and musslimani @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the nonlocal mkdv equation with the reduction @xmath3 reduces to the mkdv equation .",
    "the mkdv equation can be derived from euler equation and has applications in varies physical fields @xcite .",
    "wadati used inverse scattering transformation to study mkdv equation and obtained explicit solutions , including @xmath4-solitons , multiple - pole solutions and solutions derived from pt - symmetric potentials @xcite .",
    "hirota also achieved @xmath4-solitons by bilinear technique and investigated multiple collisions of solitons @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate further the new integrable nonlocal mkdv equation .",
    "we will construct exact solutions of the nonlocal mkdv equation including soliton and breather through inverse scattering transformation .",
    "these solutions have some new properties , which are different from the ones of the mkdv equation . +",
    "the invention of inverse scattering transformation ( ist ) is due to the pioneering work of gardner , greene , kruskal , and miura for the cauchy problem of kdv equation @xcite .",
    "ist has been developed into a systematic method to achieve exact solutions for integrable nonlinear systems @xcite . in this section , we will give the ist for the nonlocal mkdv equation .",

    "see [ 23],[24 ] , [ 14 ] ) , we will give the inverse scattering for nonlocal mkdv equation .",

    "when eigenvalues @xmath88 are suitably selected and eq .",
    "satisfies the constraint , @xmath12 becomes the solution of eq . with initial scattering data @xmath89 .",
    "+ we will emphasize here that the procedure described above of solving nonlocal mkdv equation seems same as the one for the classical mkdv equation , but there exists important difference between these two cases .",
    "the scattering coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath39 for the nonlocal case have no relations , while ones of classical problems have .",
    "this leads to that eigenvalues @xmath90 are not related , either .",
    "the normalizing coefficients @xmath91 depend on the eigenvalues @xmath90 in the nonlocal case , which will be mentioned in the next section , rather than being free parameters in the classical case . in the classical case , eigenfunctions , which are analytic in the upper @xmath8-plane ,",
    "are related to those being analytic in the lower @xmath8-plane .",
    "but , this property does not hold anymore in the nonlocal case .",
    "this is the most important difference between these two cases , which is also mentioned in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will derive soliton solutions of integrable nonlocal mkdv equation ( 3 ) from the explicit formula . + * case 1 .",

    "it indicates that @xmath12 evolves like a solitary wave with its amplitude increasing or decaying exponentially .",
    "1 describes this property .",
    "we can see that @xmath12 is a usual soliton in the case of @xmath114 .",
    "notice that in this case @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",

    "two - soliton solutions * + set @xmath120 . first , we obtain the constraints between normalizing coefficients and eigenvalues via eq . and",
    "eq . by direct calculations",
    ": @xmath121 then , the general expression of a two - soliton solution is @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 here , we focus on the case of @xmath125 being purely imaginary . set @xmath126 , @xmath127 , where @xmath128 , and @xmath129 . for @xmath130 , eq . is simplified to @xmath131,\\\\ g_1(x , t ) & = e^{u_{1-}+u_{2-}}[(\\alpha_2-\\alpha_1)(\\beta_2-\\beta_1)\\cosh(u_{1+}+u_{2+})\\\\ & \\quad+(\\alpha_1+\\beta_1)(\\alpha_2+\\beta_2)\\cosh(u_{1-}-u_{2-})+(\\alpha_1+\\beta_2)(\\alpha_2+\\beta_1)\\cosh(u_{1+}-u_{2 + } ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 this is a two - soliton solution . in fig .",
    "2 , we describe such a two - soliton with @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in this case",
    ", we see that the amplitude of one solitary wave has exponential increase as @xmath110 , and another amplitude is stable but has a change during the collision of the two solitary waves .",
    "furthermore , after interaction of the two solitary waves , there is a shift of phase and no change in the speed of them .",
    "3 gives the case of @xmath133 and @xmath135 , i.e. , the amplitude of a solitary wave increases exponentially , and the one of another solitary wave decreases exponentially .",
    "the all solutions above belong to the interactions of bright - bright solitons .",
    "interactions of bright - dark solitons can be found by setting @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the results are similar to the bright - bright case . in fig .",
    "4 , we give an example of the increase - increase case , i.e. , the amplitudes of both two solitary waves have exponential increase as @xmath110 , and the amplitude below zero increases faster than the one above zero . during the interaction ,",
    "both two solitary waves have a shift of the phase respectively and no changes in speed . in the case of @xmath138 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , the solution is a usual 2-soliton solution to nonlocal mkdv equation as well as to mkdv equation . for the case of @xmath141",
    ", the solution always has singularity at some sites .",
    "+ * case 3 .",
