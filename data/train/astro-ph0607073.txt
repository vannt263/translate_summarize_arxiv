    "the astrophysical search for signals of dark matter ( dm ) particle pair annihilations in cosmic structures on large scales ( from galaxies to clusters of galaxies ) is , potentially , a very powerful technique , highly complementary to direct dm searches , in the quest for the identification of the fundamental nature of dm .",
    "the widest and more definite set of results can be harvested through a multi - frequency survey of dm annihilation signals over the whole electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "spectrum ( see , e.g. @xcite , hereafter cpu2006 , and references therein ) by using a detailed treatment of both the microscopic interaction properties of the hadronic and leptonic secondary yields of wimp annihilations , and of the subsequent emissions originating by the yields themselves in the astrophysical environment at hand .",
    "various astrophysical systems have been taken into consideration to this aim .",
    "the central regions of ordinary galaxies ( like our own galaxy ) are usually considered among the best places to set constraints on the presence and on the nature of dm particles ( see , e.g , @xcite for a review , and the analyses in @xcite , among others ) .",
    "the typical faintness of dm signals within viable wimp scenarios makes , in fact , the galactic center , or the central regions of nearby galaxies ( like m31 ) , the most plausible and promsing places to detect signals of wimp annihilations .",
    "however , the expected dm signals have to contend , there , with the rich and often poorly understood astrophysical context of thermal and non - thermal sources ( sn remnants , pulsars , molecular clouds , to mention a few ) , whose spectral energy distributions ( seds ) cover the whole e.m .",
    "spectrum , reaching even tev energy scales , as the recent results from hess , magic , cangaroo have clearly shown ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ; see , however , also @xcite ) . in this respect ,",
    "galaxy cores are likely not the best places to definitely identify dm annihilation signals .",
    "galaxy clusters have the advantage to be mass - dominated by dm and , in some cases , like the nearby coma cluster , to have a quite extended spectral and spatial coverage of thermal and non - thermal emission features which enable to set interesting constraints on the properties of dm ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs .",
    "therein for various aspects of the dm seds in clusters ) .",
    "the study of the dm - induced seds in galaxy clusters has been shown to be quite constraining for dm wimp models , and can even be advocated to shed light on some emission features ( e.g. , radio halos , hard - x - ray and uv excesses , gamma - ray emission ) which are still unclear .",
    "nonetheless , the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the present and planned experiments in the gamma - rays , x - rays and radio do not likely allow to probe more than a few nearby clusters .",
    "it is therefore , mandatory to remain within the local environment to have reasonable expectations to detect sizable emission features of possible dm signals .",
    "globular clusters have also been proposed ( see e.g. , @xcite ) as possible sources of gamma rays from wimp annihilations , but with expected signals well below the sensitivity threshold of future experiments , mainly due to their quite low mass - to - light ratios .",
    "the ideal astrophysical systems to be used as probes of the nature of dm should be mostly dark ( i.e. , dominated by dm ) , as close as possible ( in order to produce reasonably high fluxes ) , and featuring central regions mostly devoid of sources of diffuse radiation at radio , x - rays and gamma - rays frequencies , where the dm seds peak ( see , e.g. cpu2006 for general examples ) .",
    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph )",
    "galaxies closely respond to most of these requirements , as they generally consist of a stellar population , with no hot or warm gas , no cosmic - ray population and little or no dust ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "several dsph galaxies populate the region around the milky way and m31 , and some of them seem to be dynamically stable and featuring high concentrations of dm .    among these systems ,",
    "the draco dsph is one of the most interesting cases .",
    "this object has already been considered as a possible gamma - ray source fed by dm annihilations in recent studies  @xcite , in part triggered by an anomalous excess of photon counts from draco reported by the cactus collaboration in a drift - scan mode survey of the region surrounding the dsph galaxy @xcite .",
    "the nature of the effect is still controversial , but it has been shown in @xcite to be in conflict , in most wimp models , with the egret null - result in the search for a gamma - ray source from the direction of draco @xcite .",
    "other gamma - ray upper limits have been obtained by the whipple 10-m telescope collaboration as well ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observational state - of - the - art for draco goes , however , beyond gamma - ray emissions : radio continuum upper limits on draco have been obtained by fomalont et al .",
    "@xcite with the vla .",
    "these authors report an upper limit of @xmath0 mjy at @xmath1 ghz ( this is a @xmath2 level limit ) .",
    "typical magnetic field strength of @xmath3 for dwarf galaxies similar to draco have also been derived from radio observations at @xmath4 ghz @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission from the central part of draco has an upper limit provided by rosat @xcite .",
    "the count rate detected by the pspc instrument in the ( 0.1 - 2.4 ) kev energy band is @xmath5 corresponding to an unabsorbed flux limit of @xmath6 2s .",
    "this flux corresponds to an x - ray luminosity upper limit of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "the main point we wish to make in the present analysis is that a complete multi - frequency analysis of the astrophysical dm signals coming from draco might carry much more information , and can be significantly more constraining , in terms of limits on dm wimp models than , for instance , a study of the emissions in the gamma - ray frequency range alone .",
    "as we show in the present analysis , available observational data , and the possible detection of wimp annihilation signals from draco by future instruments can be , in principle , of crucial relevance for the study of the nature of wimp dm : the expected emission features associated to dm annihilation secondary products are , in fact , the only radiation mechanisms which can be expected in a system like a dsph , as originally envisioned by colafrancesco @xcite .",
    "following our original suggestions , and pursuing the systematic approach we outlined for the case of coma ( see cpu 2006 ) , we present here a detailed analysis and specific predictions for the wimp dm annihilation signals expected from draco in a multi - wavelength strategy .",
    "specifically , we first derive the dm density profile of draco in a self - consistent @xmath9cdm scenario in sect .",
    "we then discuss the gamma - ray emission produced in draco from dm annihilation , assuming a set of model - independent wimp setups @xcite .",

    "the radial maps of the star velocity dispersions clearly indicate that dsph are dark matter dominated systems .",

    ", we resorted to illustrative cases of wimps of given mass and pair - annihilation cross section , dominantly annihilating into final states giving rise to the two extrema of a soft and a hard photon spectrum . for definiteness , and for illustrative purposes , we also considered theoretically well motivated benchmark supersymmetric models .",
    "we pointed out that unlike the case of the milky way galactic center , the spread in the estimate of the gamma - ray flux from draco is significantly narrow , once the particle physics setup for the dark matter constituent is specified , and that draco would appear as a point - like gamma - ray source in both acts and glast observations . in analogy with our procedure carried out in cpu2006  @xcite for larger dark matter halos , we implemented a fully self - consistent propagation setup for positrons and electrons produced in wimp pair annihilations , and we studied the subsequent generation of radiation in the radio frequencies from synchrotron emissions , and at higher frequencies from inverse compton scattering off starlight and cosmic microwave background photons .",
    "we showed that , unlike in larger dark matter halos , as it is the case for the coma cluster  @xcite , in small , nearby objects the spatial diffusion of electrons and positrons plays a very significant role .",
    "as a consequence , the expected radio emission from draco is spatially extended , and , depending upon the propagation setup and the values of the magnetic field in draco , can provide a detectable signal for future radio telescopes . in some cases",
    ", we find that an extended radio emission could be detectable from draco even if no gamma - ray source is identified by glast or by acts , making this technique the most promising search for dark matter signatures from the class of objects under consideration , i.e. nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "we finally showed that available data can accommodate the presence of a black hole in the center of draco , even improving the fit to the data for some values of the black hole mass .",
    "the corresponding expected enhancement in the gamma - ray flux and in the radio surface brightness for cuspy dark matter halo profiles and an adiabatic growth of the black hole can be of several orders of magnitude .",
    "if the mass of the black hole is around or larger than @xmath222 , wimp models are predicted to give unmistakable astrophysical signatures both for future gamma - ray telescopes and for future radio telescopes .",
