    "the implementation of quantum optical devices for quantum information processing is a rapidly developing field of research nowadays , passing the threshold from a learning phase into a domain of rudimentary functionality @xcite . among such devices the three - level @xmath0 - type atom placed inside a high - finesse cavity proved to be a useful building block for quantum communication schemes because of its ability to interface efficiently atoms and photons @xcite . as it was pointed out in @xcite and then realized experimentally in @xcite , such atoms may be employed for the controlled generation of a single photon in the cavity by means of vacuum - stimulated raman scattering . in these experiments",
    "one branch of the atomic @xmath0 - type transitions was coupled to the quantized cavity field , while the other one was coupled to the coherent laser field .",
    "in course of resonant interaction with the fields inside the cavity the atom emitted a single photon .",
    "the effectiveness of this process depends on the interaction parameters , in particular , it depends on the relative orientation of polarizations of the cavity field and of the laser field , since the atomic levels are usually strongly degenerate and the contributions of various zeeman components of resonant levels to the interaction are determined by the polarizations of the fields .",
    "thus in the experiment @xcite the transitions between hyperfine components @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the ground state @xmath4 and the component @xmath5 of the excited state @xmath6 of cesium atoms were employed , while in the experiments @xcite they were the transitions between hyperfine components @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the ground state @xmath9 and the component @xmath10 of the excited state @xmath11 of rubidium atoms .",
    "such polarization dependencies were studied previously @xcite for rather long interaction times , when the hyperfine structure of both the ground and the excited states was totally resolved . in this paper",
    "we study the polarization dependencies of the probability of single - photon emission via raman scattering of rather short coherent laser pulses , such that the hyperfine structure of the excited level appears to be totally unresolved .",
    "however we consider the hyperfine structure of the ground state to remain totally resolved , since the frequencies of hyperfine splitting of ground states of alkali atoms are significantly greater , than those of the excited states . in section 2",
    "we describe the interaction model and obtain the evolution operator for this model , while in section 3 we obtain the expression for the probability of single photon emission and analyze it numerically for the transitions in cesium and rubidium , employed in the experiments @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume , that the coherent laser pulse with the carrier frequency @xmath12 is in resonance with the transition @xmath13 between one hyperfine structure component @xmath14 of the ground state @xmath15 and all the hyperfine structure components @xmath16 of the excited state @xmath17 , while the quantized cavity field with the carrier frequency @xmath18 is in resonance with the transition @xmath19 between some other hyperfine structure component @xmath20 of the ground state and all the components of the excited state ( fig.1 ) . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath16 are the values of the atomic total angular momenta of the ground and excited states respectively , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote electronic total angular momenta of these states , @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the value of nuclear spin . the electric field strength , which contains the coherent field of the pulse and the quantized field of the cavity , may be put down as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the constant amplitude and the unit polarization vector of the pulse , @xmath28 is the photon annihilation operator for the cavity mode , while @xmath29 is the photon field , @xmath30 being the cavity ( quantization ) volume , @xmath31 - the unit polarization vector of the cavity field .",
    "the quantum system consists of the atom and of the quantized field .",
    "the equation for the slowly - varying density matrix @xmath32 of this system in the rotating - wave approximation is as follows : @xmath33,~    \\hat{v}=\\chi_{c}\\hat{p}_{c } - \\imath \\chi\\hat{p}\\hat{a}^{+ } + h.c.\\ ] ] here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the reduced rabi frequencies for the coherent pulse and for the cavity field , @xmath36 being the reduced matrix element of the electric dipole moment operator for the electronic transition @xmath37 , while @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the dimensionless electric dipole moment operators for the transitions @xmath41 and @xmath19 .",
    "the circular components of these vector operators are expressed through wigner 3j- and 6j- symbols and partial operators @xmath42 in a following way : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48^{1/2 } \\left\\{\\matrix{i&f_{a}&j_{a } \\cr 1&j_{b}&f_{b}}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] note , that the summation in ( [ q6 ] ) and ( [ q7 ] ) is carried out over all possible values of the atomic total angular momentum @xmath16 of the excited state .",
    "after the action of the coherent pulse with the duration @xmath49 the system density matrix , being initially @xmath50 , evolves to : @xmath51 where the evolution operator @xmath52 may be expressed through the matrix exponent : @xmath53 @xmath54 with the use of the expansion of the exponent function in taylor series and with the use of relation @xmath55 where @xmath56 the evolution operator @xmath52 may be transformed to the expression : @xmath57 @xmath58",
    "initially the atom is at the equilibrium ground state , while the cavity field is at the vacuum state , so that the initial system density matrix is : @xmath59 @xmath60 being the projector on the subspace of the hyperfine - structure component @xmath14 .",
    "the probability to detect a single photon in the cavity is given by the formula : @xmath61 where the trace is carried out in atomic variables .",
    "with the use of the evolution operator ( [ q17 ] ) this probability may be written as : @xmath62 with @xmath63 while the atomic operator @xmath64 acts in the subspace of the excited level @xmath17 .",
    "the operators @xmath65 in ( [ q21 ] ) may be also expressed in terms of atomic operators @xmath66 acting in the subspace of the ground state levels @xmath14 and @xmath20 : @xmath67 since @xmath68 the presentation of operators @xmath65 in ( [ q21 ] ) by means of @xmath69 is more convenient here , than by means of @xmath70 , because the summation in ( [ q24 ] ) in all possible values of the total angular momenta @xmath16 of the upper level and its projections @xmath71 may be carried out analytically with the help of the summation formulae for 3j- and 6j - symbols @xcite .",
    "after such summation the operator @xmath72 ( [ q24 ] ) becomes as follows : @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79^{1/2 } \\left\\{\\matrix { k & f_{a } & f'_{a }",

    "reduced rabi angle @xmath92 = @xmath93 at the orthogonal polarizations @xmath94 of the cavity and laser fields .",

    "we obtain : @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the angle between polarization vectors of the coherent pulse @xmath106 and of the cavity field @xmath107 , while functions @xmath108 are defined from ( [ q31])-([q34 ] ) .",

    "the dependence of the probability @xmath111 of single photon emission on the reduced vacuum rabi angle @xmath92 of the cavity field , which is considered to be equal to the reduced area @xmath93 of the coherent laser pulse ( @xmath92=@xmath93 ) , at the orthogonal polarizations @xmath94 of the cavity and laser fields is presented at fig.2 .",
    "the solid line refers to the values of the angular momenta @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 corresponding to the transitions in @xmath112 , while the dashed line refers to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath98 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 corresponding to the transitions in @xmath113 . in both cases the maximum probability values",
    "are obtained at the same value of rabi angles @xmath114 , though the values of probability at @xmath115 slightly differ : @xmath116 for rubidium transitions and @xmath117 for cesium transitions .",
    "the greater probabilities are obtained , if the coherent laser pulse in course of photon emission drives the atom from the less degenerate hyperfine structure component @xmath14 to the more degenerate one @xmath118 , otherwise the probabilities are decreased by the factor @xmath119 . however the maximum emission probabilities occur not at the orthogonal polarizations of laser and cavity fields .",
