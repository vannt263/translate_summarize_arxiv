    "many core - collapse supernovae are expected to explode within their parent molecular clouds . because of the influence of the surrounding material , the manifestation of the supernova remnant ( snr ) can differ substantially depending on the progenitor star type . for a relatively low progenitor mass below @xmath0 - 14@xmath1 , the stellar wind and photoionizing radiation are not sufficient to substantially clear out the surrounding cloud and already at a radius of about 6 pc the remnant can enter a radiative phase with a shock directly interacting with the molecular cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the radiative shock with a typical velocity below @xmath2 km s@xmath3  can accelerate and compress crs and produce non - thermal radiation @xcite .",
    "recently , the _ large area telescope _ on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ detected gev emission from snrs ic  443 , w44 , and 3c391 known to be directly interacting with molecular clouds ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "higher mass young stars with masses above @xmath4 ( of b0  v type and earlier ) are likely to create low - density bubbles and hii regions with radii @xmath5pc surrounded by a massive shell of matter swept up from the molecular cloud by the wind and the ionizing radiation of the star over its lifetime . in this case , a strong supernova shock propagates for a few thousand years in tenuous circumstellar matter with a velocity well above @xmath6 km s@xmath3  before reaching the dense massive shell where it decelerates rapidly .",
    "regardless of the sn type , the blast wave of the snr is expected to accelerate ambient material and generate relativistic  electrons and ions , i.e. , cosmic rays ( crs ) , which produce strong non - thermal radiation .",
    "a preponderance of evidence suggests that the particle acceleration mechanism most likely responsible is diffusive shock acceleration  ( dsa ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that despite the common acceleration mechanism , the appearance of the two classes of snrs we mention can differ very substantially . for early progenitor stars",
    ", one can expect that a sizeable fraction of the @xmath7-ray  emission is produced by the cr ions that escape the forward shock and interact with the dense surrounding shell , while for lower mass progenitors , the bulk of the non - thermal radiation is likely to come from trapped crs .",
    "while the crs produced by the snr generate non - thermal  emission across the spectrum from radio to tev @xmath7-rays , the @xmath7-rays  are of particular interest because they may be produced in proton - proton ( or heavier ion ) collisions of ultra - relativistic  particles .",
    "in fact , there are three populations of shock accelerated crs that are important for producing @xmath7-rays : relativistic electrons producing @xmath7-rays  through inverse - compton  and non - thermalbremsstrahlung ; cr ions that remain trapped within the forward shock  precursor ; and cr ions that are accelerated by the forward shock  but escape upstream .",
    "these three populations are produced simultaneously by dsa but they have very different properties and will have very different @xmath7-ray  signatures .    as has been known for some time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a large fraction of the energy in particles accelerated at strong shocks can escape at an upstream boundary .",
    "in fact , the fraction of all galactic crs that originate as escaping particles is likely to be significant and escaping crs may even provide the bulk of crs at the `` knee '' and above .",
    "the importance of modeling escaping crs was discussed before the advent of dsa ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is attracting considerable attention currently within the dsa paradigm ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite used a simple iterative scheme to construct stationary numerical solutions to the coupled kinetic and hydrodynamic dsa equations .",
    "the stationary solutions with efficient acceleration were found when the escape boundary was placed at the point where the growth and advection of strongly driven , non - resonant waves where in balance .",
    "for that particular case , they derived the energy dependence of the distribution function close to the energy break . as we shall argue below , some additional factors , e.g. , stochastic fermi acceleration on long - wavelength fluctuations , can affect the spectral shape of the escaping particles .",
    "a number of stationary , nonlinear  ( nl ) models of dsa can provide the integrated escaping cr energy flux as a fraction of the parameterized overall acceleration efficiency , but no model is yet able to determine the spectral shape of escaping crs taking into account the self - consistent  production of magnetic instabilities produced by both the trapped crs in the shock precursor and the escaping crs .-",
    "rays , requires an extremely large dynamic range that no pic simulation can yet achieve ( at least not in three - dimensions ) , and these simulations will not be able to produce results that can be compared to broadband continuum emission from snrs for the foreseeable future .",
    "approximate methods , such as we describe here , are needed ( see * ? ? ? * for a full discussion ) .",
    "] such a treatment is not yet feasible , creating an important problem since the interpretation of the @xmath7-ray  emission from young snrs depends critically on the uncertain spectral shape of both the trapped and escaping crs .",
    "therefore , a suitable parameterization of the shape of the escaping cr flux is needed to allow comparisons with @xmath7-ray  observations of young snrs in the hope of constraining nl dsa models .",
    "it is important to note , of course , that snrs are not stationary and the dynamics of an expanding remnant , even in the simplest spherical case , adds an additional factor to the issue of cr escape . as the remnant expands , the precursor region beyond the forward shock that is filled with crs expands producing a  dilution \" of cr energy density .",
    "this effect has been studied in detail by berezhko and co - workers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in a real shock , the dilution effect is coupled to escape since the lowering of the cr energy density results in less efficient generation of magnetic turbulence and this will change the escape of crs . both the flow of energy out of the shock by escape and the dilution of the cr energy density influence the rankine - hugoniot  conservation relations in similar ways .",
    "both act as energy sinks and both result in an increase in the shock compression and other nonlinear  effects . in the stationary , plane - shock approximation for dsa used here , we ignore dilution and only include the escape of crs at an upstream free escape boundary .",
    "it has been shown , however , that this plane - shock approximation gives essentially the same results for the shock structure as in a spherical , expanding shock if the specific mode of escape is unimportant ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the mode of escape becomes important , however , if the escaping cr flux is used to calculate @xmath7-ray  emission in material external to the shock .",
    "since we neglect dilution , our escaping cr fluxes , and the @xmath7-ray  emission we calculate from them , are over estimated .    in this paper , we present a new monte carlo  technique for propagating escaping crs and calculating their @xmath7-ray  production via pion - decay , in the circumstellar medium(csm ) surrounding the outer snr blast wave .",
    "this treatment of escaping crs is added to our cr - hydro simulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) producing a coherent model where a number of related elements of the snr are treated more or less self - consistently .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulation couples the efficient production of crs to the snr evolution , including the production of escaping crs as an intrinsic part of the dsa process .",
    "the escaping crs are emitted from the forward shock  as the snr evolves , their propagation is followed as they diffuse in the csm , and the @xmath7-rayemission of these crs is calculated consistently with that from the crs ( protons and electrons ) that remain trapped within the remnant . while a number of important approximations are required , including the neglect of precursor cr dilution , this model represents a fairly complete and internally self - consistent  description of a snr interacting with a non - homogeneous csm .",
    "the importance of freshly made crs interacting with their local environment to produce @xmath7-rays  has been recognized for some time and an extensive literature exists in this field . in a generalization of the model of @xcite ( and previous work , e.g. ,",
    "* ) , @xcite calculate the broad - band emission , from radio to tev @xmath7-rays , from crs produced by a snr interacting with a nearby molecular cloud .",
    "they emphasize that , depending on the parameters , the @xmath7-ray  emission can exceed other bands by a large factor , suggesting that some unidentified tev sources might be associated with clouds illuminated by nearby snrs .",
    "@xcite also note the importance of the shape of the @xmath7-rayspectrum for identifying gev - tev sources .",
    "the model used by @xcite is based on that of @xcite and includes a description of the evolution of the snr and the spectrum of escaping crs . in @xcite , the important parameter @xmath8 ,",
    "the maximum cutoff momentum for the cr spectrum , is parameterized as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the age of the snr and @xmath11 is taken to be @xmath12 to match the cr data below the knee , as measured at earth .",
    "our parameterization of @xmath8 differs considerably from this as we discuss below .",
    "an important result of @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * for an earlier derivation ) that is incorporated in the @xcite model and is not modeled here is that , when integrated over the whole sedov phase , the total cr spectrum is a power law of the form @xmath13 .",
    "recently , @xcite have applied the @xcite model to snr rx j1713.7 - 3946  taking into account the details of the ambient gas distribution .",
    "the model presented here is similar to that of @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the evolving snr is modeled with a spherically symmetric hydrodynamic simulation where the efficient production of crs via dsa is coupled to the remnant dynamics .",
    "the main difference is in the treatment of the diffusion of escaping crs in the region beyond the snr forward shock .",
    "the work of @xcite uses a `` boxel '' technique whereby , at each time step and each spatial grid in the 3d simulation box , particles are exchanged between the adjacent boxels according to the particle momentum , location , and density gradient . in the model presented here",
    ", we use a monte carlo  technique to propagate escaping crs in the region beyond the forward shock .",
    "these two methods of propagation have distinct advantages and disadvantages , and both differ importantly from more analytic models based on a direct solution of a diffusion equation . in any case , we feel the problem of crs produced by relatively young snrs interacting with dense , local material is important enough to be considered with a variety of complementary techniques .",
    "other differences between the boxel model of @xcite and our new monte carlo  model are all based on recent refinements of the cr - hydro model ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and on how we parameterize the escaping cr distribution , described below .",
    "while these refinements are important for modeling specific remnants , they do not substantially change the results given in @xcite .",
    "the model we present here consists of two main parts .",
    "the cr - hydro part is used to calculate the evolution of a snr and is essentially the same as that described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the evolution of the spherically symmetric remnant is coupled to the efficient production of crs and the production of thermal and non - thermal emission is calculated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent work modeling the broad - band emission from snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 ) .",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration  is determined in the cr - hydro model using the semi - analytic  model of blasi and co - workers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the injection scheme for this model has been discussed in detail in a number of previous papers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent extensions of the model ) but we note that we use a slightly different injection method than typically used by blasi and co - workers .",
    "since the diffusion approximation upon which the semi - analytic  model is based does nt apply to thermal particles , a parameter , @xmath14 , must be defined that specifies what fraction of thermal particles obtain a superthermal energy and are injected into the dsa mechanism .",
    "given this parameter , the nonlinear  dsa mechanism determines the fraction of shock ram kinetic energy that goes into superthermal particles , i.e. , the acceleration efficiency @xmath15 . the only difference in our implementation of this injection model and that of blasi and co - workers is that we specify @xmath15 and then set @xmath14 accordingly .",
    "both schemes are approximations since , in an evolving snr , both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are likely to be functions of age . for simplicity ,",
    "we hold @xmath15 constant .    the blasi et al .",
    "model that we use also implicitly assumes that the shock is planar and stationary .",
    "apart from the neglect of cr dilution , defined below . ]",
    "this approximation will be reasonably accurate as long as the diffusion length of the highest energy crs is a small fraction of the shock radius .",
    "the sharp x - ray synchrotron  edges often seen in snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies the presence of amplified magnetic fields which will result in short diffusion lengths . in our models here",
    "we assume that the diffusion length of protons with maximum momentum @xmath8 is 1/10 of the shock radius , a small enough value to validate the planar approximation yet allow @xmath16 , consistent with most models of cr production in snrs .",
    "accounting for escaping crs is essential in efficient dsa and escaping crs are implicitly included in blasi s semi - analytic  description .",
    "however , until now we have not included them in the production of radiation in the remnant environment in our cr - hydro model .",
    "the neglect of radiation produced by escaping crs is justified if the snr is in a uniform csm with no external density enhancements . in this case , the emission from trapped crs interacting with the shocked material is always much greater than that produced by escaping crs in the less dense , unshocked external medium ( see model b in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot1 ] ) .",
    "the second and new part of our model is a calculation of the escaping cr distribution that emerges from the snr forward shock  and the propagation and interaction of these escaping crs in a dense , spherically symmetric shell external to the snr . depending on the density of the external material",
    ", @xmath7-rays  produced by the escaping crs can overwhelm those produced by trapped crs , as emphasized by @xcite .",
    "we note that while here we restrict ourselves to spherical symmetry for the external mass distribution , it is straightforward to generalize the monte carlotechnique to arbitrary mass distributions .      as we make clear in describing our parameterized escaping cr model , both the fraction of energy in escaping crs and their spectral shape are uncertain .",
    "however , while controversial for some years , the idea that some fraction of the most energetic particles in a shock undergoing dsa must escape , regardless of whether the shock is stationary or not , is now generally accepted although certain qualifications are still made ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we believe that energetic particle escape is a fundamental and unavoidable part of dsa that must occur in all supercritical collisionless shocks regardless of @xmath8 or time evolution because ( 1 ) observations and modeling of the earth bow shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) support escape , ( 2 ) particle escape is an intrinsic part of many particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 3 ) dsa requires self - generated turbulence to work over any reasonable dynamic range . since crs must interact with self - generated turbulence to be further accelerated",
    ", the highest energy crs far upstream in the shock precursor will always lack sufficient turbulence to remain nearly isotropic and some fraction will escape .",
    "these escaping crs will generate turbulence for the next generation of crs , creating a bootstrap effect .",
    "as mentioned above , the dilution of cr energy density that occurs in spherical , expanding shocks will be coupled to cr escape through the magnetic turbulence generation .",
    "given the assumptions and approximations of the model , the semi - analytic  description of @xcite determines the energy in escaping crs , @xmath17 , but does not determine the shape of the distribution . while other work does determine the shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the shape that results in these models depends importantly on arbitrary parameters and the assumptions made for the diffusion of the highest energy escaping crs .",
    "since the shapes of the trapped and escaping cr distributions , at the highest accelerated energies , are critical for modeling both x - ray synchrotron  emission and gev - tev @xmath7-ray  emission , we feel it is important to have a flexible , i.e. , parameterized , model that can be compared to observations to provide information on the uncertain plasma processes until an adequate theory of self - generated turbulence in the presence of escaping particles is developed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent work on long - wavelength instabilities that may influence the maximum momentum crs can obtain in a given shock ) .",
    "as an example of the complexities that may exist , the amplified long - wavelength fluctuations discussed in @xcite may result in particle acceleration by the resonant second - order fermi mechanism .",
    "the stochastic acceleration rate , @xmath18 , for particles with spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath19 in the shock precursor is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the phase velocity .",
    "while this rate may be below the first - order acceleration rate , it may still be high enough to influence the spectra shape at the highest particle energies achieved by first - order dsa .",
    "the spectral index of particles accelerated by the second - order fermi mechanism depends on the parameter @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the escape time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of resonant stochastic particle acceleration by long - wavelength fluctuations , @xmath24 $ ] , where the characteristic wave number of the cr instability ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the mean cr current , @xmath27 is the cr gyroradius at @xmath8 in the magnetic field @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the forward shock alfvnic mach number .",
    "therefore , for a large enough precursor cr current , @xmath26 , as expected for efficient dsa , the parameter @xmath30 may influence the shape of the cr distribution in the spectral break region .",
    "for instance , if a shock of velocity @xmath31 produces a power - law spectrum of accelerated particles up to some maximum momentum and transfers a fraction @xmath32 of the shock ram pressure to crs , then @xmath33 with a weak dependence on the particle momentum . the smaller @xmath22 , the larger is the second - order fermi effect and preliminary work ( a. bykov , in preparation ) suggests that @xmath34 is needed to see a significant modification of the spectral shape .",
    "while more exact estimates are difficult , we might expect @xmath35 and @xmath36 km s@xmath3  to produce a noticeable effect .    when the shock accelerated particles approach @xmath8 , they begin leaving the upstream region of the shock and the approximate power - law distribution of particles that remain in the shock turns over in a fashion that will depend on the diffusion coefficient of the highest energy particles . whatever the plasma processes are for escaping particles , the shape of the escaping distribution , @xmath37 , is determined by how crs leave the shock and is , therefore , coupled to the trapped distribution . since no current model of self - generated turbulence adequately describes the diffusion of escaping crs , the diffusion coefficient is generally assumed to be bohm - like right up to @xmath8 and independent of position relative to the shock .    here",
    ", we parameterize the escaping cr phase - space distribution , @xmath37 , as a modified parabola centered at @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is the maximum momentum crs would obtain if the acceleration cut off sharply when the upstream diffusion length , @xmath38 , where @xmath31 is the speed of the fs and @xmath39 is a free escape boundary . in our snr model , the maximum momentum is determined primarily by an arbitrary parameter , @xmath40 , which is the fraction of the shock radius equal to the diffusion length of protons with momentum @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the radius of the fs at time , @xmath10 . for all of the examples shown here , we set @xmath43 ; a factor small enough to be consistent with the planar shock approximation in the blasi et al . dsa calculation . in which case this value is used ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "the escaping crs are emitted from the snr as it evolves so the escaping crs that were produced earliest have been diffusing for approximately @xmath69yr and many have left the simulation box .    for the case where the csm is uniform ( black curves ) , the escaping crs diffuse outward and uniformly fill the region beyond the snr forward shock  with a density that deceases uniformly with radius as expected . with the dense shell , the escaping cr density drops rapidly as the crs enter the shell . with this @xmath101 ,",
    "the shell is about 2pc thick .",
    "cosmic rays that propagate beyond @xmath109pc are removed from the simulation .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fp1 ] we show the cr distributions for both the crs that remain trapped in the snr ( black solid and dotted curves ) and escaping crs . in all cases ,",
    "the integrated distributions are determined at @xmath69yr .",
    "the red curve in the top panel is the summed escaping distribution as the crs leave the fs , i.e. , before they propagate into the external csm .",
    "the solid and dashed blue curves are the escaping crs , at @xmath69yr , after propagation and we remind the reader that our escaping cr fluxes are over estimates since we do nt model dilution which , in fact , occurs simultaneously with escape .",
    "the bottom panel shows just the escaping crs with an expanded scale .",
    "note that throughout this paper we include only escaping protons and ignore escaping heavier ions and escaping electrons .",
    "trapped electrons are considered for inverse - compton  emission . the distributions for the escaping crs after propagation are lower than the distribution as crs leave the fs for two reasons .",
    "the first is that some crs escape from the simulation box at @xmath110 .",
    "the second is that some escaping crs diffuse back into the snr and these crs are ignored and not included in the blue distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fp1 ] .",
    "the crs that remain trapped in the shock are summed from the contact discontinuity  to the forward shock .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot1 ] we show the various photon components for the models with @xmath111 and @xmath112@xmath87/s .",
    "the results for the two models are identical except for the pion - decayemission from the escaping crs .",
    "as expected , escaping crs interacting with the dense external shell produce substantially more emission than those interacting with the uniform csm . in both cases , however , the emission from escaping crs is much more strongly peaked than the pion - decayemission from the trapped cr protons . for the trapped crs ,",
    "the relative intensity of the pion - decay  emission and the inverse - compton  emission depends on the various parameters chosen , most particularly @xmath94 and @xmath113 , the electron to proton ratio at relativistic  energies .",
    "the fact that our values , @xmath98@xmath81  and @xmath114 , result in inverse - compton  dominating the gev - tev emission is not necessarily an indication that we believe this will always be the case .",
    "the issue is more complicated as indicated in a number of recent papers ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regardless of other parameters , the _ relative importance _ of the @xmath7-ray  emission from escaping crs and trapped crs depends mainly on the external density enhancement . in fig .",
    "[ fig : extvary ] we show the effect of the normalization of the csm diffusion coefficient as escaping crs diffuse into the dense shell .",
    "three effects are noticeable .",
    "the first is that the escaping cr density drops more rapidly with stronger scattering ( i.e. , smaller @xmath115 ) as crs enter the dense shell .",
    "the second is that the escaping cr density remains larger in the region between the fs and the dense shell when scattering is strong even though the flux of escaping crs that leave the fs is the same in all three cases .",
    "the third effect is that , beyond the dense shell , the escaping cr density falls off faster with stronger scattering .",
    "the cr density remains large within the shell ( i.e. , at radii @xmath116pc ) for strong scattering because the dense shell acts as a valve that slows the flow of crs out of the system . beyond the dense shell ,",
    "weak scattering results in a more uniform density distribution than strong scattering since crs rapidly fill the available volume when the scattering is weak .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : photonvary ] we compare the pion - decay  emission for the three examples given in fig .",
    "[ fig : extvary ] , all with the same ambient density distribution .",
    "the crs trapped in the snr are the same for these cases so the pion - decay  emission from the trapped crs ( dashed curve ) is the same in the three models . also identical for the three cases is the escaping cr flux as it emerges from the fs .",
    "the sole difference is the scattering strength , @xmath115 , in the csm and this produces a fairly strong effect on the pion - decay  emission from the escaping crs . while the emission from escaping crs shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : phot1 ] and [ fig : photonvary ] is summed over the entire region from the outer radius of the snr at @xmath93 to @xmath109pc , when a dense shell is present , most of the emission originates in the shell , as expected .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary_gyro ] we compare escaping cr distributions for different power - law dependences of the gyroradius , i.e. , @xmath117 ( model e ) , @xmath118 ( model f ) , and @xmath119 ( model g ) . for variety , the models in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary_gyro ] , along with those in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary_density ] below , use a different set of csm parameters than the models discussed thus far , as shown in table  [ tab : tablea ] . for the three examples shown , the csm parameters are identical and the mean",
    "free paths differ only in the value of @xmath78 ; the normalization of the diffusion coefficient @xmath120@xmath87 s@xmath3 and @xmath121 are the same for the three values of @xmath78 . as the dependence on @xmath78 increases , the high momentum crs are able to stream through the csm quickly and the number that remain within the simulation region at @xmath69yr drops .",
    "the strong @xmath78 dependence also results in a flatter radial density distribution , as indicated by the blue curve in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vary_gyro ] .",
    "the reason for this is that the momentum near the peak in the escaping distribution that is used to calculate the density profiles is well above 10gev so the examples with larger @xmath78 have longer mean free paths .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary_density ] we show a similar plot where we now keep @xmath89 and vary the power - law index for the density dependence of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath122 and there is no density dependence for the diffusion coefficient , the presence of the external dense shell produces no effect and the red curve in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vary_density ] falls off uniformly with radius . for stronger density dependences ( green and blue curves ) , the density of escaping crs drops as they enter the dense external shell which has a radius @xmath123pc for these models and those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vary_gyro ] .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : fpcuthalf ] and [ fig : fpcuttwo ] we compare pion - decay  emission for @xmath124 ( model j ) and @xmath125 ( model k ) .",
    "all other parameters for these two models are the same as indicated in table  [ tab : tablea ] .",
    "as seen in the top panels of these figures , the cr distributions vary considerably for these values of @xmath46 .",
    "the photon emission ( bottom panels ) , of the trapped ( dashed curves ) and escaping crs ( solid curves ) varies less strongly due to the fact that the photon emission is naturally spread out partially masking the shape of the underlying proton spectrum .",
    "one clear feature that remains is the low - energy kinematic cutoff at a few hundred mev .",
    "of course , figs .",
    "[ fig : fpcuthalf ] and [ fig : fpcuttwo ] were calculated for a particular set of parameters and the relative importance of photon emission from escaping crs versus trapped crs will depend strongly on these parameters .",
    "as part of a comprehensive model of an evolving snr undergoing efficient cr production , we have presented a monte carlo  technique that describes the diffusion of crs that escape from the forward shock  of the remnant and propagate into a dense , external shell .",
    "while a number of calculations of escaping crs and their @xmath7-rayproduction have been performed ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , there remain many unresolved issues for this important problem .",
    "our monte carlo  method makes different assumptions than analytic calculations based on solving a diffusion equation and in some ways is less restrictive , particularly if energy losses are included during propagation .",
    "the important features of our model include : = 0by 1  the energy content of the escaping cr distribution is determined with the shock accelerated crs that remain trapped within the snr using a planar , stationary , nonlinear  model of efficient diffusive shock acceleration  that neglects dilution ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; by 1  the acceleration of crs produces changes in the hydrodynamics that modifies the evolution of the snr ; by 1  the shape of the trapped cr distribution at the highest energies , which is uncertain due to a lack of a well developed theory of turbulence generation for anisotropic particles , is parameterized consistently with the shape of the escaping cr distribution ; by 1  the broad - band continuum photon emission from escaping and trapped crs is determined with a single set of environmental and model parameters ; and by 1  although not emphasized or shown in the plots here , the thermal x - ray emission is included consistently with the broad - band continuum emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the examples we show indicate the complexity and importance of including escaping crs in a consistent fashion with crs that remain trapped within the snr .",
    "the shape of the gev - tev emission , particularly the low - energy kinematic cutoff , is important as one of the main ways of determining whether this emission is pion - decay  or inverse - compton .",
    "if other features are discernable , they may provide clues to the importance of the escaping crs and external density enhancements .",
    "we note that all of the spectra shown here are integrated over the region between the contact discontinuity  and the forward shock  and are not line - of - sight projections",
    ". it should be clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : extvary ] that line - of - sight projections might show additional strong effects as escaping crs interact with nearby dense material .",
    "line - of - sight projections will be included in future work .",
    "an important parameter that we havent varied here is the efficiency of dsa . in all of our examples we set @xmath108%",
    ", i.e. , 50% of the forward shock ram kinetic energy flux goes into crs ( trapped and escaping ) at any instant . in fitting an actual snr",
    ", @xmath15 is a parameter that may or may not be constrained by the observations .",
    "a considerable amount of work has led to the conclusion that @xmath126% is a likely figure for young snrs but this efficiency will definitely vary between remnants , may vary during the remnant lifetime , and may even vary at different locations in a single snr ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "we note that monte carlo  shock simulations that include mfa and have parameters typical of young snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , show total acceleration efficiencies @xmath127% with a sizable fraction of total shock ram kinetic energy ( @xmath128% ) placed in escaping crs .    since we set @xmath108% for all of our examples , and the other snr parameters that determine what fraction of explosion energy ends up in crs are kept constant , the third panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : pmax ] gives the results for all of our models .",
    "after 1000yr , @xmath129% of the supernova explosion energy has gone into all crs with @xmath5% going into escaping crs . at 10,000yr , @xmath130% has gone into all crs with @xmath131% going into escaping crs .    in this initial presentation of our monte carlo  technique , we have exploded the supernova in a uniform csm with an external , spherically symmetric shell of dense material .",
    "this simple scenario shows how important escaping crs can be for modeling non - thermal emission of young snrs .",
    "it is not meant to match any particular object .",
    "the monte carlo  propagation part of the cr - hydro model can be easily generalized to include asymmetric external mass distributions , such as those expected when remnants interact with a dense molecular cloud ( e.g. , snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 ) .",
