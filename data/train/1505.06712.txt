    "[ sec : intro ]    the post - carbon burning evolution of stars near the transition from those that leave white dwarfs to those that make supernovae has always been challenging to model @xcite .",
    "for non - rotating stars of solar composition , the most interesting mass range is from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . for other metallicities ,",
    "the range may vary @xcite . in these stars ,",
    "the effects of degeneracy persist and , combined with neutrino cooling by the plasma- and pair - processes , lead to temperature inversions , off - center shell ignition , and composition inversions . despite these computational challenges , the late stages of evolution of these stars",
    "have been studied extensively .",
    "representative historical and important recent calculations have been done by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "an obscure , but relevant historical reference is @xcite .",
    "this was the first , and so far as we know , only study to report a quite different outcome for the explosion of @xmath6 stars - a violent flash at the onset of silicon ignition that ejected the envelope of the star .",
    "after the envelope was ejected , the remaining bound core , consisting of a mixture of silicon and iron , completed its silicon burning evolution and collapsed , about a year later , to a neutron star .",
    "the collision between the matter ejected when the iron core collapsed and the previously ejected envelope created an unusually bright supernova . for a time , an informal , unpublished discussion went on between the japanese ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and us groups as to the actual fate of @xmath6 stars - electron capture in a core of neon and oxygen resulting in collapse or silicon deflagration followed by iron - core collapse , with the ultimate agreement being that probably both happened for some narrow range of masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we return to this issue with the same code used in 1980 , but with improved stellar and nuclear physics .",
    "we find , as anticipated , that both electron - capture supernovae and silicon deflagration are common outcomes for stars near @xmath6 .",
    "for the assumed physics , the production of a neon - oxygen core that collapses due to electron capture on unburned fuel happens for solar metallicity stars below @xmath7 , while degenerate silicon flashes characterize stars from @xmath7 to @xmath8 . in the range @xmath9 to @xmath4 ,",
    "the flash is particularly violent and could lead to envelope ejection prior to iron core collapse .    in ",
    "[ sec : physics ] the stellar and nuclear physics used in the models is discussed . in   [ sec : presn ] the evolution below @xmath7 is briefly reviewed .",
    "this subject is worth revisiting , if only to set some fiducial masses for the kepler code .",
    "we find , as have many others , regions of mass where carbon - oxygen ( co ) dwarfs are the outcome and others where neon - oxygen - magnesium ( one ) white dwarfs result .",
    "if such stars retain their hydrogen envelope until death , thermonuclear supernovae ( co - dwarfs ) or electron - capture supernovae ( one dwarfs ) will result . in   [",
    "sec : flame ] and   [ sec : sishell ] , we discuss the stars that , following the propagation of convectively bounded oxygen and silicon burning flames , produce iron cores that collapse to neutron stars . a novel treatment of oxygen burning flames ( oxygen cbfs ) is employed that incorporates a subgrid model for the flame propagation as a function of temperature in a full star calculation of the evolution (   [ sec : oflame ] ) .",
    "the silicon flash and its prompt effects are studied for each model where it occurs . since the flash frequently ignites off - center , one must also follow the subsequent propagation of a _ silicon _ burning cbf to the center after the core contracts and reignites burning (   [ sec : siflame ] ) .",
    "it is found that the rayleigh - taylor instability plays a major role in the propagation of this silicon - burning flame .    in ",
    "[ sec : siflash ] , we discuss , in greater detail , those stars where silicon ignites explosively , calculating the light curves for a few cases where a large amount of silicon burns (   [ sec : ultra ] ) . some of these events can be brighter than a type ia supernova ( sn ia ) for a month or two .",
    "finally , we conclude (   [ sec : conclude ] ) with some speculations regarding the nature of the supernova that made the crab nebula and speculate as to how our results might change in the case of a more realistic multi - dimensional simulation .",
    "[ sec : physics ]    the full evolution of stars with main sequence masses in the range @xmath10 to @xmath11 was calculated ( table [ tab : endstate ] ) using the kepler code @xcite .",
    "all stars had an initially solar composition and , with one exception (   [ sec : rotate ] ) , were not rotating .",
    "the solar abundance set employed was from @xcite with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and metallicity , @xmath14 .",
    "mass loss was included using standard prescriptions and the nuclear reaction rates and opacities were the same as used in many previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the grid of stellar masses calculated was non - uniform and focused upon stars where the nature of silicon burning was rapidly varying . for stars lighter than @xmath7 , the `` end state ''",
    "was not determined since the calculations were halted once a very thin helium shell had formed .",
    "these stars would evolve as super - asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) stars and may produce electron - capture supernovae or just end their lives as one white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an important aspect of the calculation was the use of a moderate - sized nuclear reaction network directly coupled to the stellar structure ( for prior examples , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the network at the presupernova stage typically contained approximately 230 isotopes from carbon through germanium .",
    "a representative network included @xmath15h , @xmath16he , @xmath17li , @xmath18be , @xmath19b , @xmath20c , @xmath21n , @xmath22o , @xmath23f , @xmath24ne , @xmath25na , @xmath26 mg , @xmath27al , @xmath28si , @xmath29p , @xmath30s , @xmath31cl , @xmath32ar , @xmath33k , @xmath34ca , @xmath35sc , @xmath36ti , @xmath37v , @xmath38cr , @xmath39mn , @xmath40fe , @xmath41co , @xmath42ni @xmath43cu , @xmath44zn , @xmath45ga @xmath46ge and neutrons . a test case ( 10.5 @xmath47 ) that used a larger network of 365 isotopes , the difference being more neutron - rich isotopes for the same elements above calcium , gave nearly identical results for the presupernova composition and structure .",
    "for example , the silicon core masses differed by less than 0.005 @xmath47 , and the central values of @xmath48 for the two cases were 0.4334 and 0.4324 for the two cases .",
    "heavier elements and more isotopes could easily have been included , and would be necessary to study the s - process in these stars , but the purpose here was to survey the structure of presupernova stars , not their heavy element nucleosynthesis .",
    "it was important to link this network directly to the structure during post - helium burning evolution because of the considerable electron capture that goes on in the degenerate stellar cores prior to silicon ignition @xcite .",
    "it was also important to include the proper nuclear physics for silicon burning itself when the composition consists chiefly of @xmath49si and @xmath50s , not @xmath51si and @xmath52s .",
    "an `` alpha - network '' would have been wholly inadequate and the `` qse '' network normally used for silicon burning in kepler would not treat neutron - rich silicon burning very accurately ( even though it does include special reactions for the destruction of @xmath49si ) .",
    "the network was `` adaptive '' @xcite .",
    "any isotope that would have appreciable abundance was automatically and dynamically added as needed during the calculation .",
    "up until the time of iron core collapse , the electron fraction , @xmath53 , within the helium core stayed in the range @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "thus the composition and weak interactions were well represented by the moderate - sized network .",
    "weak interactions during oxygen and silicon burning affect the evolution , mostly by altering the chandrasekhar mass . here , as in past studies @xcite , the ground state decay rates were taken as a lower bound to be used at low temperature and density .",
    "at higher temperature and density , the weak rates of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were used . for details of the implementation see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the outcome of presupernova evolution in this mass range is known to be sensitive to the treatment of semi - convection and convective overshoot mixing .",
    "an important consequence is setting the co - core mass that results for a given main sequence mass ( table [ tab : endstate ] ) .",
    "our co - core masses turned out to be somewhat larger , for a given main sequence mass , than in some other studies reflecting a greater efficiency of overshoot mixing .",
    "for example , calculations using the mesa code sometimes give smaller co cores @xcite .",
    "there is considerable variation for this quantity in the literature though @xcite , and our core masses are within previously published ranges .",
    "results can also be sensitive to zoning . in most cases of interest carbon , oxygen , or silicon burning ignite off center as convective shells whose base is characterized by a large , nearly discontinuous temperature inversion .",
    "these burning shells propagate inwards in mass by way of conductive flames or rayleigh - taylor instability . too large a zone could artificially halt the migration of the flame @xcite in a calculation that did not include a subgrid model for the burning .",
    "typical calculations here used 1000 to 1300 lagrangian zones , but the zoning was not uniform . due to the rapid temperature change near the flame , fine zones were automatically inserted in its vicinity . to avoid the runaway insertion of zones in the temperature discontinuity ,",
    "a minimum mass was specified . except for a single sensitivity study at 9.5 @xmath47 , no zones smaller than @xmath56 were allowed , except near the surface of the star . in practice",
    ", this meant that zones in the vicinity of the flame typically had a thickness of roughly @xmath57 to @xmath58 km , except very near the center where they were thicker .",
    "@xcite have suggested the possible importance of thermohaline mixing in the study of stars in this mass range .",
    "thermohaline mixing is included in kepler using the formalism of @xcite and @xcite , but adopted to a general equation of state as done for the stability considerations described in @xcite and using an efficiency coefficient , @xmath59 , of unity .",
    "this formulation has also been used by @xcite .",
    "we did not find that thermohaline mixing had an important effect in any of our oxygen - burning or silicon - burning flames since the laminar flame propagation and rayleigh - taylor mixing dominated .",
    "[ sec : presn ]    while the critical masses depend upon the code physics , especially for convection , the evolution of massive stars below @xmath7 can be segregated into three broad categories based upon their final outcome ( table [ tab : endstate ] ) : _ 1 ) _ co white dwarfs ( below @xmath60 ) ; _ 2 ) _ one white dwarfs ( @xmath60 - @xmath7 , depending upon mass loss ) ; and _ 3 ) _ electron - capture supernovae ( upper end of @xmath60 - @xmath7 , depending upon mass loss ) .",
    "there have been many studies of this mass range . @xcite and @xcite recently carried out surveys similar to ours , though neither followed the post - oxygen burning evolution . both found outcomes qualitatively similar to ours , although certain critical masses were shifted upwards in mass by about @xmath61 in the study of @xcite .",
    "they obtained co white dwarfs for stars below @xmath62 , whereas our limit is @xmath60 . for @xmath62 itself",
    ", they found a transition object that only partly burned its carbon , quite similar to our @xmath60 model . from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , they found one white dwarfs , and , at @xmath9 , they found electron capture supernovae .",
    "we obtain one dwarfs and electron - capture supernovae from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , the same upper bound as also found by @xcite .",
    "the variation in critical masses in these three studies can be attributed to the their treatments of mass loss , semiconvection , convective overshoot mixing , and , to a lesser extent , nuclear physics , opacities , and the initial metallicity of the stars .",
    "we claim no superiority for either treatment , but point out that similar categories of behavior are probable in any evolution code that carries all the relevant physics , but with mass shifts due to uncertainties in that physics .",
    "[ sec : co ]    a representative case of a star that made a co white dwarf was the @xmath10 model .",

    "our star developed a maximum helium convective core near helium depletion of @xmath71 , however , which resembles more their @xmath65 model ( they found @xmath72 for the maximum convective core in that model ) .",
    "at central helium depletion , our helium core had a mass of @xmath73 .",
    "later , convective dredge up reduced the helium core and co - core to @xmath74 . at that time , the helium shell became very thin and flashes began .",
    "our star then had a luminosity of @xmath75erg@xmath76s@xmath77 , a radius of @xmath78 cm , and a total mass of @xmath79 .",

    "the luminosity and radius are @xmath85erg@xmath76s@xmath77 and @xmath86 cm and the present star mass is @xmath87 .",
    "thin shell flashes were not resolved in this study , but continued evolution will probably produce a carbon - oxygen white dwarf . [",

    "there is some possibility that a few of these stars might become `` type 1.5 supernova '' @xcite if the chandrasekhar mass is reached before the entire envelope is ejected .",
    "altogether , the @xmath10 model here resembled closely the @xmath60 to @xmath65 models of @xcite , the chief difference with their @xmath60 model being the greater extent of the helium convective region during core helium burning .",
    "the @xmath60 model itself was an interesting transition case which ignited , but did not complete carbon burning .",
    "its hydrogen and burning lifetimes were @xmath88myr and @xmath89my and the maximum extent of the helium convective core , @xmath90 .",
    "at central helium depletion , the helium core mass was @xmath91 . once again , these lifetimes are the same as the @xmath60 model of @xcite , but the extent of the convective core was more like their heavier @xmath62 model .",
    "carbon burning ignited off center at @xmath92 when convective dredge up had reduced the helium plus co core mass to @xmath93 .",
    "this is slightly less than the minimum core mass for carbon ignition of @xmath94 cited by @xcite .",
    "the density and temperature at the carbon ignition point were @xmath95g@xmath76@xmath82 and @xmath96k , similar to values previously found by @xcite .",

    "overall the evolution of this @xmath60 model was similar to the @xmath62 model of @xcite and the @xmath7 model of @xcite ( though one would have to go to the @xmath5 model of @xcite to find a star that ignited carbon so close to the center ) .     of the @xmath60 model at a time when nuclear burning has ceased in the core .",

    "this star is remarkable for having retained substantial unburned carbon in a core composed mostly of oxygen and neon when nuclear activity has ceased .",
    "if continued helium shell burning or accretion were ultimately to increase the degenerate core to the chandrasekhar mass , it could possibly explode as a carbon - deflagration supernova .",

    "if the envelope is not lost prior to reaching the chandrasekhar mass , this would be sufficient to ignite a carbon deflagration and produce a type 1.5 ( single star ) or type  ia supernova ( mass exchanging binary ) .    in summary",
    ", we find for this mass range , using the standard physics in kepler , a value for the upper mass that does not ignite carbon burning of approximately @xmath0 .",

    "[ sec : flame ]    a major complication inhibiting the realistic modeling of heavier stars in the 9.0 to @xmath134 mass range ( table [ tab : endstate ] ) is the need to realistically represent the cbfs that ignite during their post - carbon - burning evolution @xcite .",
    "cbfs occur when any major fuel ( hydrogen , helium , carbon , neon , oxygen , or silicon ) ignites off center . above 9.0 @xmath47 , hydrogen , helium and carbon ignite centrally and it is the combustion of the heavier fuels - oxygen , neon , and silicon - that complicates matters .",
    "the temperature inversion that causes off - center ignition is due to the interaction of degeneracy and neutrino losses and , because of the high temperature sensitivity of the burning processes , the energy transport above the burning region is always convective .",
    "the fuel first ignites somewhere off - center in a degenerate flash . depending upon the degree of the degeneracy ,",
    "the flash can be weak or violent , and the burning quickly drives convection out to the mass necessary to radiate the excess energy as neutrinos .",
    "initially , the temperature at the base of the shell is not high enough to lead to substantial inward motion of the burning front by conduction , though there could , of course , be convective `` undershoot mixing '' .",
    "that is , the low temperature in the temperature gradient immediately beneath the convective zone initially implies such a slow conductive flame speed that the time for the base to move inwards in mass is long compared to the time for the composition in the shell to evolve .",
    "thus , initially , the base of the shell stays approximately fixed in lagrangian coordinate while the fuel burns in a shell .",
    "as the temperature at the base of the convective shell rises in response to the decreasing mass fraction of fuel though , the conductive flame speed , which is very sensitive to that `` bounding temperature '' , accelerates inwards . in the resulting flame , burning in the temperature gradient just beneath the convective shell raises the local temperature to a critical value where nuclear energy generation exceeds radiative and conductive losses .",
    "that region then flashes to a higher temperature that is super - adiabatic compared with the next zone out .",
    "unspent fuel spills into the convection shell and is mixed outwards , providing a new source of fuel for burning in the shell . the energy produced is mostly lost to neutrinos .",
    "the next zone in heats up by conduction and the process repeats .",
    "as the flame moves into the unburned matter , the decreasing area bounded by the flame requires the flame to move faster , hence it becomes hotter .",
    "[ sec : microflame ]    there are two ways of viewing such flames . the `` microscopic view '' , which has just been described , envisions the flame as a thin sheet with a specified boundary temperature that propagates locally , by conduction , into a homogeneous medium with prescribed properties like a modified laminar flame ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the other `` macroscopic '' view (   [ sec : macroflame ] ) views the flame as a boundary condition the star adjusts to accommodate the global constraints of hydrostatic equilibrium , composition , and neutrino losses .",
    "the two views are complementary ways of describing the same physical phenomenon .    in the microscopic view , if the flame were well resolved ( it is nt usually ) , the process of burning and mixing would be continuous .",
    "the energy generation resulting from the flame s propagation would vary slowly according to the local composition , density , and bounding temperature .",
    "the flame properties would agree with those estimated by evaluating the usual laminar flame speed formula @xcite with appropriate modifications , @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the flame speed , @xmath137 , its width , @xmath138 , the nuclear energy generation rate , @xmath139 , the reciprocal mean free path , c , the speed of light , and @xmath140 , the energy difference , in erg g@xmath77 , between the cold fuel beneath the flame and the base of the convective shell .",
    "results are most sensitive to the energy generation , and it is here that things can become complicated . for a `` free flame '' the temperature and energy generation can rise without bound and the above equations give a very narrow , fast flame @xcite . at 10@xmath141 g @xmath82 , for example , the flame speed and width for an oxygen - neon burning flame are 6.4 km s@xmath77 and @xmath142 cm . for the cbf , however , the burning temperature can not exceed the bounding temperature .",
    "in fact , the temperature where conduction inwards balances energy generation is a bit less than the bounding temperature ( * ? ? ? * their fig . 8) .",
    "thus a cbf moves much more slowly and is broader than an unbounded or `` free '' flame .",
    "[ sec : oflame ]    a case of particular interest here is a cbf moving into a core of about 60% oxygen and 30% neon .",
    "eventually , both oxygen and neon burn , but in the conductive region that sets the flame speed , only a little fuel has burned , and that is chiefly neon . since neon burning proceeds by a photodisintegration - rearrangement reaction , the energy generation is , to first order , independent of the density .",

    "more accurate results have been obtained off - line from the highly resolved numerical modeling of parametrized flames .",
    "such studies have been done for oxygen - neon flames @xcite , but not for silicon burning . for the oxygen - neon flame described above",
    ", these studies find , for @xmath149 k , a flame speed @xmath150 = 1.91 cm s@xmath77 and width , @xmath137 = 250 cm , very much smaller than any practical stellar zone thickness .",
    "apparently evaluating the energy generation at 90% of the bounding temperature though , 1.8 vs 2.0 @xmath151 k , gives the correct order of magnitude .",
    "changing the bounding temperature used in the estimate would greatly distort the speed - to - width ratio , though one could artificially change the opacity and achieve agreement . the chief use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : flamespeed ] ) is in understanding and extrapolating the more accurate numerical studies .",
    "for example , in table 6 of @xcite the flame speed depends on the bounding temperature roughly as t@xmath152 .",
    "this is the approximately the square root of the temperature dependence of the energy generation rate in kepler in the relevant temperature range .",
    "similarly the width goes as t@xmath153 and both are approximately independent of the density .    in order to follow oxygen - neon flames in kepler , a subgrid representation of the propagation",
    "was implemented .",
    "first the location of the flame on the grid , if there was one , was determined based upon composition and temperature information .",
    "a flame was deemed to exist when , moving outwards , a stellar zone was encountered where the temperature increased by more than 10% and the mean atomic weight decreased by more than 2% .",
    "in addition , the hotter zone was required to be hotter than @xmath154 . for cooler temperatures",
    "the flame speed is negligible .",

    "this happened because the phase velocity for the burning implied by the adiabatic temperature gradient at such high luminosities was supersonic .",
    "had convection been turned off at a lower luminosity this supersonic burning probably would not have occurred . the fact that a detonation induced by a shallow temperature gradient failed to survive is also suggestive that detonation may be difficult to achieve in a silicon - rich composition .",

    "though 10.3 @xmath47 , silicon burning ignites in a strong flash that , especially in the more massive stars , can become a deflagration . above 10.4 @xmath47 , all burning stages ignite in the center of the star without strong flashes .",
    "[ fig : fates ] ]    we find , as have others , that those stars in this mass range that do eventually produce neutron stars have compact structures . that should be easy to explode using neutrinos , possibly too easy . without strong magnetic fields and rotation , which we argue",
    "are negligible here , and without the ram pressure of an accreting mantle , the resulting explosion will probably be much weaker than the customary @xmath325erg inferred observationally for common supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and possibly more symmetric .",
    "though certainly not the last word , our treatment of cbfs in oxygen and silicon burning is novel (   [ sec : microflame ] ) .",
    "despite including the relevant physics , including a large network and associated neutrino losses , we do not find that thermohaline mixing or urca shells pay a major role in either stage .",
    "flame propagation and rayleigh - taylor instability , to the extent that either can be modeled in a 1d calculation , dominate .",
    "the advancement of the burning is also driven by macroscopic considerations (   [ sec : macroflame ] ) , the need to provide fuel to maintain the entropy of a core whose mass already exceeds the cold chandrasekhar limit .",
    "since the burning can only be sustained by the inward propagation of a flame , the cbf can not go out , but must proceed , by whatever processes , at a rate at least sufficient to balance neutrino losses from the core .",
    "but we have also demonstrated the need for further work .",
    "the tables of @xcite for cbf speeds need to be extended , for oxygen - neon compositions , to lower density , and similar tables calculated for neutron - rich silicon burning .",
    "perhaps more importantly , portions of the oxygen- and silicon - cbf evolution need to be examined in 3d .",
    "this could be done , for example , with an adaptive mesh , low - mach - number code like maestro @xcite .",
    "our 1d description of a cbf as a discontinuous spherical shell is almost certainly wrong . in 3d",
    ", the burning may be localized into numerous hot spots .",
    "whether the resulting temperature structure will be able to prevent a large scale overturn of the composition inversion is a fascinating question .    a novel result of the present models ( though see * ?",
    "* ) is the possibility of silicon igniting degenerately with a violent flash .",
    "for the 9.2 , 9.4 , 9.5 , and @xmath326 models , ordinary convection was ( barely ) capable of transporting the energy from the flash efficiently enough that no runaway on a hydrodynamical time scale occurred .",
    "for the 9.0 , 9.3 and 9.8 - @xmath134 models , however , the flash was so powerful that ordinary convection was not able to transport the energy and a localized deflagration developed . in this regard , the silicon flash in these stars resembles a type ia supernova in a chandrasekhar carbon - oxygen white dwarf with an outcome that is likely to be equally difficult to determine .",
    "a key difference is that , unlike carbon burning , silicon burning to iron - group nuclei provides inadequate energy to unbind the core .",
    "the rapid burning does , however , cause an expansion of the core on a time scale that is short compared with the hydrodynamic time of the surrounding helium shell and base of the hydrogen envelope .",
    "the observable outcome in these cases depends upon how much silicon burns in the flash and , once again , 3d calculations will ultimately be needed to answer the question . here",
    "the efficiency of silicon deflagration was parametrized by adjusting , artificially , a convective efficiency parameter .",
    "if the amount of silicon that burns is less than about 0.3 @xmath47 , the silicon flash has little observable consequence . because of the small energy release , the core does not expand greatly and recovers rapidly .",
    "the neutrino - mediated kelvin - helmholtz time for the silicon - iron core is less than about two weeks .",
    "if iron core collapse launches a second more powerful shock , as seems likely , the shock from the silicon flash will be overtaken either prior to or shortly after breakout . while the breakout transient itself might be altered , the main light curve would not change greatly .",
    "unfortunately , based upon our understanding of similar explosions in type ia supernovae , the amount burned in an off - center ignited thermonuclear runaway may be small if no detonation occurs @xcite , and this may be the case for silicon deflagration as well .",
    "if so , a rather ordinary type iip supernovae , will result , albeit with lower than typical velocities and brightness on the plateau ( fig .",
    "[ fig:10blite ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the amount of silicon that burns substantially exceeds @xmath327 , there will be an appreciable delay between envelope ejection and core collapse ( table [ tab : outcome ] ) .",
    "burning more silicon gives higher speed to the ejected envelope and lengthens the kelvin - helmholtz time for the recontracting core .",
    "maximum ejection speeds for the envelope range from several hundred to several thousand km@xmath76s@xmath77 . for the more energetic explosions , those that burned @xmath328 of silicon and more , the waiting time between envelope ejection and final core collapse was months to years giving rise to the possibility of two supernova - like events from the same star .",
    "the first event is far fainter than the second , and fainter than typical type iip supernovae .",
    "this behavior is intriguing given the historical record for the crab supernova , sn  1054 .",
    "because of the low mass of the ejecta , the small abundances of heavy elements , and the presence of a pulsar , this supernova has often been associated with the death of a star that , on the main sequence , had a mass @xmath329 @xcite .",
    "yet the historical record , such as it is , suggests that the crab was not unusually faint @xcite .",
    "we agree with smith that the crab may have been brightened by a substantial contribution from `` circumstellar interaction '' .",
    "to appreciably alter the light curve at maximum , however , one needs a substantial fraction of a solar mass of material at @xmath33010@xmath303 cm .",
    "the models we calculated here for stars in the @xmath9 - @xmath4 range are capable of doing that provided that the silicon flash is sufficiently violent to burn roughly half the core .",
    "a new calculation (   [ sec : rotate ] ) of 10 @xmath47  evolution that includes rotation and the effects of magnetic torques predicts a rotation rate for the newly minted crab pulsar of about 17 ms , which compares quite favorably with the observationally inferred value at birth , about 21 ms .",
    "the same calculation predicts a gravitational mass from the crab pulsar of from 1.2 to @xmath289 .",
    "even if the silicon flash proves inadequate to eject the envelope sufficiently in advance of core collapse , there is still the possibility of substantial mass ejection by energy transported acoustically from the vastly super - eddington convective shells during the last few years of the evolution (   [ sec : wind ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unlike supernovae in more massive stars where the length of oxygen burning is a few months or less @xcite , oxygen shell burning igniting off - center and moving inwards by a convectively bounded flame typically takes years to reach the center .",
    "even a small fraction of the integrated convective luminosity during the last ten years would be sufficient to eject the entire envelope .",
    "the interaction of the supernova shock with a dense wind could also appreciably brighten the event @xcite .",
    "we appreciate helpful correspondence with adam burrows and thomas janka regarding the energy of models for accretion - induced collapse and john lattanzio regarding the evolution of agb stars .",

    "<S> below @xmath3 , degenerate oxygen - neon cores form that may become either white dwarfs or electron - capture supernovae . above @xmath4 the evolution </S>",
    "<S> proceeds `` normally '' to iron - core collapse , without composition inversions or degenerate flashes . </S>",
    "<S> emphasis here is upon the stars in between which typically ignite oxygen burning off center . after oxygen burns in a convectively bounded flame , silicon burning ignites in a degenerate flash that commences closer to the stellar center and with increasing violence for stars of larger mass . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> the silicon flash is so violent that it could lead to the early ejection of the hydrogen envelope . </S>",
    "<S> this might have interesting observable consequences . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the death of a @xmath5 star could produce two supernova - like displays , a faint low energy event due to the silicon flash , and an unusually bright supernova many months later as the low energy ejecta from core collapse collides with the previously ejected envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the potential relation to the crab supernova is discussed . </S>"
