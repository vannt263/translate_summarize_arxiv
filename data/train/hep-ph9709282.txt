    "in view of the large number of jet events at the @xmath1 resonance collected both at lep and slc , it is desirable for precision tests of the standard model to use in the theoretical predictions next - to - leading order ( nlo ) partonic matrix elements that include the full quark mass dependence .",
    "this is particularly important for @xmath2 quark enriched samples , which can be obtained with high purity using vertex detectors .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath0 jets are well - known for massless quarks @xcite .",
    "the three , four , and five jet rates involving massive quarks have been computed to leading order in @xmath3 already some time ago @xcite .",
    "recently , results for the nlo corrections to @xmath0 jets including mass effects have been reported @xcite . knowing the nlo matrix elements including the mass dependence , one can try to extract the mass of the @xmath2 quark from three jet rates involving @xmath2 quarks at the @xmath1 peak .",
    "this was suggested in @xcite , elaborated in @xcite , and experimentally pursued by the delphi collaboration @xcite .",
    "further applications include precision tests of the asymptotic freedom property of qcd by means of three jet rates and event shape variables measured at various center - of - mass energies , also far below the @xmath1 resonance @xcite . for theoretical predictions concerning the production of top quark pairs at a future @xmath4 collider ,",
    "the inclusion of the full mass dependence is of course mandatory .",
    "we have computed the complete differential distributions for @xmath4 annihilation into three and four partons via a virtual photon or @xmath1 boson at order @xmath5 , including the full quark mass dependence @xcite .",
    "this allows for order @xmath5 predictions of oriented three jet events ( for the massless case , see @xcite ) , and of any quantity that gets contributions only from three and four jet configurations . in this talk",
    "we give an outline of our calculation ( for details , see @xcite ) , after which we present some numerical results .",
    "the calculation of an arbitrary quantity dominated by three jet configurations and involving a massive quark - antiquark pair to order @xmath5 consists of two parts : first , the computation of the amplitude of the partonic reaction @xmath6 at leading and next - to - leading order in the qcd coupling . here @xmath7 denotes a massive quark and @xmath8 a gluon .",
    "second , the leading order matrix elements of the four - parton production processes @xmath9 are needed . here",
    "@xmath10 denote light quarks which are taken to be massless .    the infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) singularities , which are encountered in the computation of the one - loop integrals ,",
    "are treated within the framework of dimensional regularization in @xmath11 space - time dimensions .",
    "we remove the uv singularities by the standard @xmath12 renormalization .",
    "we have converted from the outset the on - shell mass of the heavy quark @xmath7 into the corresponding running @xmath12 mass .",
    "it is known that far from threshold one thereby absorbs some large logarithms into the running mass .",
    "after renormalization , the virtual corrections to the differential cross section for @xmath13 still contain ir singularities .",
    "these have to be cancelled by the singularities that are obtained upon phase space integration of the squared tree amplitudes for the production of four partons .",
    "different methods to perform this cancellation have been developed ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we use the so - called phase space slicing method elaborated in @xcite , which we modified to account for masses @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to `` slice '' the phase space of the four parton final state by introducing an unphysical parton resolution parameter @xmath14 , which is much smaller than all relevant physical scales .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 splits the phase space into a region where all four partons are `` resolved '' and a region where at least one parton remains unresolved . in the unresolved region soft and collinear divergences reside , which have to be isolated explicitly to cancel the singularities of the virtual corrections .",
    "this is considerably simplified due to collinear and soft factorizations of the matrix elements which hold in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "( in the presence of massive quarks , the structure of collinear and soft poles is completely different as compared to the massless case . ) after having cancelled these ir poles against the ir poles of the one - loop integrals entering the virtual corrections , one is left with a completely regular differential three - parton cross section which depends on @xmath14 . the contribution to a three jet quantity of the `` resolved ''",
    "part of the four - parton cross section is finite and may be evaluated in @xmath16 dimensions , which is of great practical importance .",
    "it also depends on @xmath14 and is most conveniently obtained by a numerical integration .",
    "since the parameter @xmath14 is completely arbitrary , the sum of all contributions to any observable must not depend on @xmath14 .",
    "since the individual contributions depend logarithmically on @xmath14 , it is a nontrivial test of the calculation to demonstrate that observables become independent of @xmath14 for small values of this parameter .",
    "we will now discuss results for some three jet observables involving massive quarks .",
    "all quantities are calculated by expanding in @xmath3 to nlo accuracy .",
    "we consider here the jade @xcite and durham @xcite jet finding algorithms , although other schemes @xcite can also be easily implemented .",
    "first we demonstrate the independence of physical quantities on the parameter @xmath14 as @xmath15 .    -1.2",
    "cm    we choose as an example the three jet fraction for @xmath2 quarks , @xmath17 in ( [ f3b ] ) , the numerator @xmath18 is defined as the three jet cross section for events in which at least two jets containing a @xmath2 or @xmath19 quark remain after the clustering procedure .",
    "this requirement ensures that the cross section stays finite also in the limit @xmath20 . the contribution of the process @xmath21 to the three jet cross section with _",
    "one _ tagged @xmath2 quark develops large logarithms @xmath22  which find no counterpart in the virtual corrections against which they can cancel  when the @xmath23 pair is clustered into a single jet . in principle",
    ", there are three ways to handle this problem : one may impose suitable experimental requirements / cuts to suppress contributions from events with two light quark jets and one jet containing a @xmath23 pair ( the definition for @xmath18 chosen by us is an example for this ) , or one can improve the fixed order calculation by absorbing the large logarithm into a fragmentation function for a gluon into a @xmath2 quark . the third possibility is simply to keep the large @xmath22 term .",
    "this may however lead to an overestimate of the @xmath2 quark mass effects in some observables .",
    "a detailed discussion of this issue will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "-1.2 cm    fig .",
    "[ fig : smindu ] shows the three jet fraction @xmath24 in the durham scheme at nlo as a function of @xmath25 at a fixed value of @xmath26 and @xmath27 gev .",
    "the corresponding plot for the jade scheme has a similar shape . for the renormalization scale",
    "we take in this plot @xmath28 .",
    "as mentioned above , we use @xmath29 defined in the @xmath30 scheme at the scale @xmath31 .",
    "the asymptotic freedom property of qcd predicts that this mass parameter decreases when being evaluated at a higher scale .",
    "( for low energy determinations of the @xmath2 quark mass see e.g. @xcite and references therein . ) with @xmath32 gev @xcite and @xmath33 as an input and employing the standard renormalization group evolution of the coupling and the quark masses , we use the value @xmath34 gev .",
    "one clearly sees that @xmath24 reaches a plateau for small values of @xmath35 .",
    "the error in the numerical integration becomes bigger as @xmath36 . in order to keep this error as small as possible without introducing a systematic error from using the soft and collinear approximations , we take in the following @xmath37 for the durham algorithm and @xmath38 for the jade algorithm . at these values ,",
    "the dominant @xmath14-dependent individual contributions from three and four resolved partons are about a factor of 4 ( durham ) and 2.5 ( jade ) larger than the sum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ycutdu ] we plot @xmath24 as a function of @xmath39 , again at @xmath40 .",
    "the qcd corrections to the lo result are quite sizable as known also in the massless case . the renormalization scale dependence ( where @xmath31 is varied between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , which is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ycutdu ] , is modest in the whole @xmath39 range exhibited for the durham algorithm .",
    "-1.2 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : renormdu ] we take a closer look on the scale dependence of @xmath24 , now using the on - shell mass renormalization scheme .",
    "we vary the scale @xmath31 between @xmath43 and @xmath42 for a fixed value @xmath44 and on - shell masses @xmath45 gev and @xmath46 gev .",
    "we see that the scale dependence of the lo result ( which is solely due to the scale dependence of @xmath3 at this order ) in the durham algorithm amounts to about 100% in the @xmath31 interval shown .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath5 corrections reduces the scale dependence significantly ; the nlo result for @xmath24 at @xmath47 is about 10% smaller than the nlo result at @xmath48 . in the case of the jade algorithm , which we do not show here ,",
    "the difference between @xmath24 at @xmath47 and at @xmath48 is reduced from about 100% at lo to about 30% at nlo",
    ".    the effect of the @xmath2 quark mass may be illustrated by looking at the double ratio @xmath49 where the denominator is the three jet fraction when summing over all active quark flavors , which is given to a very good approximation by the massless nlo result @xcite .",
    "similar double ratios have been studied in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "-1.2 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : edep ] we plot @xmath50 as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy at @xmath51 for the jade algorithm .",
    "the running of @xmath3 is taken into account in the curves , where we again use as an input @xmath52 .",
    "for the dashed ( lo ) and full ( nlo ) curve we use a running mass @xmath53 evolved from @xmath54 gev .",
    "for comparison we also show the lo result for a fixed value of the @xmath2 quark mass @xmath55 gev ( dash - dotted curve ) , which is the corresponding value of the pole mass .",
    "one clearly sees that the effect of the @xmath2 quark mass gets larger for smaller c.m .",
    "energies .    -1.2 cm    another interesting quantity to study mass effects is the differential two jet rate @xcite defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the two jet fraction at @xmath58 for a given jet algorithm .",
    "the advantage of @xmath59 over the three jet fraction @xmath60 lies in the fact that the statistical errors in bins of @xmath61 are independent from each other since each event enters the distribution only once . to order @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath61 can be calculated from the three- and four jet fractions using the identity @xmath62 we define @xmath63 where we  as in the case of the quantity @xmath50  use the massless nlo result to evaluate the denominator .",
    "we plot our result for @xmath64 in the durham scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2du ] , again for @xmath65 .",
    "the effects of the @xmath2 quark mass are of the order of 5% or larger at small values of @xmath39 .",
    "we have presented nlo results for a number of three jet observables involving massive quarks .",
    "it will be interesting to see how our predictions compare to detailed experimental analyses .    9 r.k .",
