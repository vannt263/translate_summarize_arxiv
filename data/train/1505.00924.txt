    "in the search for signals for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion experiments , one estimates possible effects of incoherent superposition of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions @xcite , that serves the baseline for extracting the signals , while the @xmath0 collision data , at respective centre - of - mass energy , provide the required input on cross - section of nucleon - nucleon collisions in modeling the multiparticle production by binary collisions among the participating nucleons of the colliding nuclei . in this scenario of the qgp study , an unexpected feature , namely the `` ridge '' in the long range near side angular correlation , in distinct class of `` high multiplicity '' events of proton - proton collisions @xcite at @xmath5 7 tev at lhc",
    "has triggered revival of an old school of thought @xcite of the possibility of formation of a collective medium in @xmath0 collisions also .",
    "several of subsequent theoretical and phenomenological studies @xcite , in different approaches , endorse the possibility , indicating the need for further investigations in understanding the high - multiplicity @xmath0 events vis - a - vis the qgp .",
    "in this article , we address the issue of collectivity in high multiplicity @xmath0 events in the framework of the string percolation model , that has successfully explained the collectivity and the change of phase in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "most importantly , in the context of the present work , the spm also describes the centre - of - mass energy dependence of mid - rapidity multiplicity @xcite and the pseudorapidity distributions @xcite of produced charged particles in @xmath0 collisions , for the entire range of energy , available so far .",
    "in the string percolation model ( spm ) , the sources of multiparticle productions are the color strings between the colliding partons .",
    "the stretched strings between the receding partons decay into new pair of partons and so new strings are formed .",
    "subsequently , particles are produced from interaction of partons by the schwinger mechanism @xcite .",
    "the higher the energy of the collision , the more dominant becomes the role of the sea quarks and gluons , resulting in availability of a large number of color strings .",
    "so , with the increasing energy of collision and / or the size of the colliding system , the density of the string increases and they start to overlap forming clusters .",
    "the overlapped strings start interacting . at a certain critical density ,",
    "the strings start percolating through one another , forming a macroscopic cluster of strings - a geometrical phase transition takes place . the cluster of percolated color strings is considered to be equivalent to the de - confined partonic state of matter .",
    "in fact , there has been considerable progress in the spm in establishing connection @xcite between the percolation phase transition of color strings and the qcd phase transition in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "as already discussed , the model has been extended in describing features of multiparticle production in @xmath0 collisions also .",
    "one of the relevant parameters in spm is the transverse impact parameter density of strings , @xmath6 . for pp collisions ,",
    "@xcite one can write @xmath7 where @xmath8 is @xmath9 fm the single string transverse size , @xmath10 fm is the proton transverse size and @xmath11 is the average number of single strings . for values of @xmath6 below the critical value for the 2-dimensional percolation ,",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath13 , depending on the profile function homogeneous or wood saxon type ) , the strings do not interact and the collective effect is absent . for values @xmath14 ,",
    "one observes the formation of long strings due to fusion and stretching between the colliding nucleons . to search for de - confinement and collectivity",
    ", we consider @xmath15 .",
    "the other principal parameter in spm is the color suppression factor @xcite , f(@xmath6 ) , which is related to the particle density @xmath16 and the number ( @xmath17 ) of strings as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a normalization factor @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21    for pp collisions one can approximately write @xmath22 with @xmath23 the beam rapidity and @xmath24 a constant parameter @xmath25 @xcite .    in the above equation",
    "one may notice that the factor @xmath26 slows down the rate of increase in particle density with energy and with the number of strings , as the strength of the color field inside a cluster of n strings is @xmath27 and the strength of a single string is due to the random direction of the individual color field in color space .    the schwinger model with percolation @xcite @xmath28",
    "the cms experiment at the lhc has measured @xmath29-spectra from @xcite pions ( @xmath30 ) , kaons ( @xmath31 ) and protons ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) from @xmath0 collisions at @xmath34 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev in the rapidity range @xmath35 for different classes of events depending on mean number of charged particles , @xmath36 in the pseudo - rapidity interval , @xmath37 .",
    "the measured @xmath29 - ranges are ( 0.1 to 1.2 ) gev / c for @xmath30 , ( 0.2 to 1.050 ) gev / c for @xmath31 and ( 0.35 - 1.7 ) gev / c for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . by measuring",
    "the @xmath38 - dependent identified particle spectra , the cms experiment provides the unique opportunity for somewhat `` centrality '' dependent study in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "we fit the transverse momentum distributions for identified particles from different classes of high multiplicity events to obtain the string density , to evaluate the corresponding @xmath4 , ( measure of fluidity ) to check the collective nature of the medium , if formed .",
    "the distribution of transverse momentum for any type of collision can be expressed as @xcite @xmath39^{\\alpha}}\\ ] ] so that the transverse momentum distribution can be write as @xmath40^{\\alpha-1}}\\ ] ]    in the case of pp collision with no high multiplicity data ( min bias ) equation ( 5 ) becomes @xmath41^{\\alpha}}\\ ] ] and so equation ( 6 ) transform into @xmath42^{\\alpha-1}}\\ ] ]    using the high multiplicity data of pions from reference @xcite we had perform a fit over the in the different collision energies transverse momentum distribution of produced particles with equation ( 8) , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are energy dependent parameters of the experimental observed spectra in p - p collisions at a given energy , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the percolation parameters for the p - p collisions and the high multiplicity p - p collisions respectively .",
    "all these parameters are energy dependent but below 200 gev @xmath46 is small so that @xmath48 .    table 1 .",
    "contains the obtained corresponding parameters from the fit of the equation(6 ) with data @xcite .",
    ".parameters of the transverse momentum distribution ( 6 ) in pp collisions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have seen in this work that the measured high multiplicity events in @xmath49 collisions at the energies @xmath50 gev , @xmath2 tev and @xmath3 tev are able to reach the geometrical phase transition in the framework of string percolation model that marks the critical string density at which collective effects appears as a result of the increasing density due to a kind of centrality at these events .",
