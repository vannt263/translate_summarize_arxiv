    "in many quantum mechanical systems the mechanisms for the occurrence of bit flip and phase flip errors are quite different . in a recent paper ioffe and mzard @xcite postulated that quantum error - correction should take into account this asymmetry .",
    "the main argument given in @xcite is that most of the known quantum computing devices have relaxation times ( @xmath0 ) that are around @xmath1 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding dephasing times @xmath2 . in general",
    ", relaxation leads to both bit flip and phase flip errors , whereas dephasing only leads to phase flip errors .",
    "this large asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath3 suggests that bit flip errors occur less frequently than phase flip errors and a well designed quantum code would exploit this asymmetry of errors to provide better performance .",
    "in fact , this observation and its consequences for quantum error correction , especially quantum fault tolerance , have prompted investigations from various other researchers @xcite .",
    "our goal will be as in @xcite to construct asymmetric quantum codes for quantum memories and at present we do not consider the issue of fault tolerance .",
    "we first quantitatively justify how noise processes , characterized in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath3 , lead to an asymmetry in the bit flip and phase flip errors . as a concrete illustration of this we consider the amplitude damping and dephasing channel . for this channel",
    "we can compute the probabilities of bit flip and phase flips in closed form .",
    "in particular , by giving explicit expressions for the ratio of these probabilities in terms of the ratio @xmath4 , we show how the channel asymmetry arises .    after providing the necessary background ,",
    "we give two systematic constructions of asymmetric quantum codes based on bch and ldpc codes , as an alternative to the randomized construction of @xcite .",
    "recall that a quantum channel that maps a state @xmath5 to @xmath6 with @xmath7 $ ] , @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 $ ] is called a _",
    "pauli channel_. for a pauli channel , one can respectively determine the probabilities @xmath11 that an input qubit in state @xmath5 is subjected to a pauli @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 error .",
    "a combined _ amplitude damping and dephasing channel _",
    "@xmath15 with relaxation time @xmath0 and dephasing time @xmath3 that acts on a qubit with density matrix @xmath16 for a time @xmath17 yields the density matrix @xmath18.\\ ] ] this channel is interesting as it models common decoherence processes fairly well .",
    "we would like to determine the probability @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 such that an @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 error occurs in a combined amplitude damping and dephasing channel .",
    "however , it turns out that this question is not well - posed , since @xmath15 is not a pauli channel , that is , it can not be written in the form ( [ pauli - channel ] ) .",
    "however , we can obtain a pauli channel @xmath22 by a technique called twirling @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the twirling consists of conjugating the channel @xmath15 by pauli matrices and averaging over the results .",
    "the resulting channel @xmath22 is called the pauli - twirl of @xmath15 and is explicitly given by @xmath23    given a combined amplitude damping and dephasing channel @xmath15 as above , the associated pauli - twirled channel is of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in particular , @xmath27 if @xmath28 , then we can approximate this ratio as @xmath29 .",
    "the kraus operator decomposition @xcite of @xmath15 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 ; a_1 = \\left[\\begin{smallmatrix } 0 & 0\\\\0&\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\end{smallmatrix}\\right];a_2 = \\left[\\begin{smallmatrix } 0 & \\sqrt{\\gamma}\\\\0 & 0\\end{smallmatrix}\\right],$ ] and @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "we can rewrite the kraus operators @xmath34 as @xmath35 rewriting @xmath36 in terms of pauli matrices yields @xmath37 it follows that the pauli - twirl channel @xmath22 is of the claimed form , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) .",
    "computing the ratio @xmath38 we get @xmath39 if @xmath28 , then we can approximate the ratio as @xmath29 , as claimed .",
    "thus , an asymmetry in the @xmath0 and @xmath3 times does translate to an asymmetry in the occurrence of bit flip and phase flip errors .",
    "note that @xmath40 indicating that the @xmath41 errors are as unlikely as the @xmath42 errors .",
    "we shall refer to the ratio @xmath38 as the channel asymmetry and denote this parameter by @xmath43 .",
    "asymmetric quantum codes use the fact that the phase flip errors are much more likely than the bit flip errors or the combined bit - phase flip errors",
    ". therefore the code has different error correcting capability for handling different type of errors .",
    "we require the code to correct many phase flip errors but it is not required to handle the same number of bit flip errors .",
    "if we assume a css code @xcite , then we can meaningfully speak of @xmath12-distance and @xmath14-distance . a css stabilizer code that can detect all @xmath12 errors up to",
    "weight @xmath44 is said to have an @xmath12-distance of @xmath45 .",
    "similarly if it can detect all @xmath14 errors upto weight @xmath46 , then it is said to have a @xmath14-distance of @xmath47 .",
    "we shall denote such a code by @xmath48_q$ ] to indicate it is an asymmetric code , see also @xcite who was the first to use a notation that allowed to distinguish between @xmath12- and @xmath14-distances .",
    "we could also view this code as an @xmath49_q$ ] stabilizer code .",
    "further extension of these metrics to an additive non - css code is an interesting problem , but we will not go into the details here .",
    "recall that in the css construction a pair of codes are used , one for correcting the bit flip errors and the other for correcting the phase flip errors .",
    "our choice of these codes will be such that the code for correcting the phase flip errors has a larger distance than the code for correcting the bit flip errors .",
    "we restate the css construction in a form convenient for asymmetric stabilizer codes .",
    "[ lm : css ] let @xmath50 be linear codes over @xmath51 with the parameters @xmath52_q$ ] , and @xmath53_q$ ] respectively .",
    "let @xmath54 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath55_q$ ] asymmetric quantum code , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "if in the above construction @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then we say that the code is pure .    in the theorem above and elsewhere in this paper @xmath60 denotes a finite field with @xmath61 elements .",
    "we also denote a @xmath61-ary narrow - sense primitive bch code of length @xmath62 and design distance @xmath63 as @xmath64 .",
    "in @xcite , ioffe and mzard used a combination of bch and ldpc codes to construct asymmetric codes .",
    "the intuition being that the stronger ldpc code should be used for correcting the phase flip errors and the bch code can be used for the infrequent bit flips .",
    "this essentially reduces to finding a good ldpc code such that the dual of the ldpc code is contained in the bch code .",
    "they solve this problem by randomly choosing codewords in the bch code which are of low weight ( so that they can be used for the parity check matrix of the ldpc code ) .",
    "however , this method leaves open how good the resulting ldpc code is .",
    "for instance , the degree profiles of the resulting code are not regular and there is little control over the final degree profiles of the code . furthermore , it is not apparent what ensemble or degree profiles one will use to analyze the code .",
    "we propose an alternate scheme that uses ldpc codes to construct asymmetric stabilizer codes .",
    "we propose two families of quantum codes based on ldpc codes . in the first case we use ldpc codes for both the @xmath12 and @xmath14 channel while in the second construction we will use a combination of bch and ldpc codes . but first , we will need the following facts about generalized reed - muller codes and finite geometry ldpc codes .",
    "let us denote by @xmath65 the euclidean finite geometry over @xmath66 consisting of @xmath67 points . for our purposes",
    "it suffices to use the fact that this geometry is equivalent to the vector space @xmath68 .",
    "a @xmath69-dimensional subspace of @xmath68 or its coset is called a _",

    "this matrix is also referred to as the incidence matrix .",
