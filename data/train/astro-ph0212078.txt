    "the question whether the morphology of galaxies is imprinted by the initial conditions of their formation or rather determined by secular evolution remains a subject of intense debate .",
    "the existence of the hubble sequence has for many years provided important constraints on this issue . in very simple terms",
    "the hubble sequence tells us that galaxies are made up of two components : a bulge and a disk .",
    "the canonical view of these components has long been that bulges have @xmath1 surface brightness profiles @xcite while disks have exponential surface brightness profiles .",
    "as one goes from early - type to late - type galaxies one goes from galaxies that are bulge - dominated to galaxies that are disk - dominated .",
    "while this simplistic interpretation of the hubble sequence has definite value , reality is considerably more complicated .    in recent years",
    ", our views of the hubble sequence have evolved and gained more nuance . for elliptical galaxies",
    "it has become clear that they are not necessarily pure bulge systems : many elliptical galaxies contain embedded disks .",
    "there is evidence from other information ( e.g. , kinematics ) that elliptical galaxies form a heterogeneous class of galaxies that may have formed in different ways ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for spiral galaxies",
    "a clearer understanding has developed of their bulge properties .",
    "high - resolution imaging - both from the ground ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) - has shown that the central surface brightness profile ( sbp ) of many late - type spirals can not be fit by the classical @xmath1 law that is well suited to describe the bulge profiles of early - type spirals . instead , the sbps of many late - type spirals rise above the extrapolation of the exponential disk in a way that can be well described by a second exponential @xcite .",
    "this has led to the now popular view that spiral bulges come in two flavors : on the one hand , the classical @xmath1 bulges which are mostly observed in early - type spirals , and on the other the `` pseudo - bulges '' @xcite or `` exponential bulges '' @xcite which are prevalent in later hubble types . in reality",
    "there is probably a continuum of properties , instead of a dichotomy .",
    "when @xmath0 profiles @xcite are fit to available sbps , the profile shape parameter spans the full range of values @xmath2 ; the profile shape parameter correlates with both hubble type and bulge - to - disk ratio of the galaxy , in the sense that spiral galaxies with earlier hubble type have bulges with higher @xmath3 values @xcite .",
    "the existence of different types of bulges in disk galaxies can be plausibly explained in the context of popular scenarios for the formation and secular evolution of galaxies .",
    "the classical massive @xmath1 law bulges fit in with the `` primordial collapse '' formation scenario first suggested by @xcite , in which the bulge forms during the initial collapse of a galaxy - sized density perturbation , and later `` acquires '' a disk through accretion processes .",
    "by contrast , the pseudo - bulges may have formed by secular evolution of a pre - existing disk , so that they formed after the disk , out of disk material .",
    "some support for this scenario comes from the fact that pseudo - bulges are dynamically similar to their host disks @xcite .",
    "plausible secular evolution scenarios include the accretion of satellite galaxies @xcite , buckling instabilities in a stellar bar @xcite , and the disruption of a stellar bar through the accumulation of a central mass concentration @xcite .",
    "many discussions of these and related topics can be found in the review by @xcite and in the proceedings of the recent workshop on ` the formation of galactic bulges ' @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the presence and properties of bulges in the very latest - type spiral galaxies ( scd or later ) .",
    "this is an important topic for several reasons .",
    "first , these galaxies are generally classified as very late type spirals because they do not have a very prominent bulge . as a result , many observational studies of bulges have avoided these galaxies .",
    "second , it has become clear from recent work with hst that the majority of spiral galaxies contain a central star cluster . in the very latest - type spiral galaxies",
    "we find that @xmath4% of the galaxies contain such a star cluster ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . in late hubble types , these clusters are easily mistaken for a small bulge when observed from the ground , even in good seeing conditions .",
    "so the bright , compact `` bulges '' in late - type spirals which were used as a classification criterion in the original work of @xcite may in fact be dense star clusters occupying the photocenter of the galaxy .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to shed some light on these issues . in particular",
    ", we investigate whether the very latest - type spirals are completely bulgeless , whether they show excess light above the constant scale - length disk , and if so , whether this in fact implies the presence of a separate entity which could rightfully be called a bulge .",
    "hst resolution is needed to separate the luminous nuclear star cluster from a putative bulge .",
    "our i - band snapshot survey of late - type spiral galaxies conducted with the _ wide field and planetary camera 2 _ ( wfpc2 ) and discussed in paper  i therefore forms the basis of our analysis .",
    "we complement the hst observations with ground - based data that extends to larger radii .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in   [ sec : data ] , we describe the data and the analysis methods that form the basis of our work .",
    "the results of our analysis are summarized in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings , and present our conclusions in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "the target list and selection criteria for the hst sample are described in paper i. in brief , we selected 113 nearby ( @xmath5 ) galaxies with low inclination ( @xmath6 ) and hubble type between scd and sm ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "77 galaxies have been observed to date with wfpc2 on board hst in the f814w filter which is similar to johnson i - band . in all cases ,",
    "the integration time was @xmath8 .",
    "after standard data reduction to correct for instrumental effects and cosmic rays , we performed an isophotal analysis using the ellipse task in iraf .",
    "for all galaxies studied in the present analysis , the ellipse center , ellipticity , and position angle were allowed to vary freely from isophote to isophote .",
    "the wfpc2 sbps have been published in figures  1 and 2 of paper i. in this study , we discuss the 19 galaxies for which we were able to find ground - based , wide - field surface brightness data for comparison . our focus lies on the structural properties of the disks rather than the photometry of the nuclear clusters ( which was the subject of paper i ) .      due to the short integration time ( @xmath9 ) of the wfpc2 snapshot observations ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is generally insufficient to make use of the wf chips in our analysis .",
    "it is therefore prudent to ask whether the rather limited field - of - view of the pc chip yields a representative view of the galaxy disk . in order to address this question , we searched the literature for published wide - field observations of our sample galaxies",
    ". in general , these are scarce , most likely due to the less than spectacular star formation activity and rather low surface brightness of the latest hubble type spirals . in this context",
    ", it is worth pointing out that all - sky surveys such as 2mass do not reach the required sensitivity to map the outer disk of most of our sample galaxies , and hence are not useful for our purposes .",
    "we found published wide - field sbps for 19 of our sample galaxies which are listed in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "all but one ( ngc4904 ) of these 19 galaxies harbor a nuclear cluster as described in paper i. the wide - field surface brightness data for 18 galaxies are based on images in the _ photometric atlas of northern bright galaxies _",
    "( panbg , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the digitized profiles , which have been studied in detail by @xcite , were kindly provided to us in machine readable form by m. hamabe .",
    "the panbg images were taken in the v - band , with sbps derived from cuts along the major and minor semi - axes of the galaxy , typically extending out to radii between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "for comparison to the high - resolution wfpc2 data , we use ( in most cases ) the average of the two semi - major axis cuts .",
    "for some galaxies , visual inspection of the images and profiles in the panbg showed that one or both semi - major axis cuts appeared affected by large - amplitude , small - scale variations . in these cases , we either used the remaining semi - major axis cut , or the average of the _ semi - minor _ axes , scaled by the ellipticity of the envelope ellipse ( the elliptical fit to the isophote contour at @xmath12 ) listed in column13 of the panbg .",
    "the remaining galaxy ( ngc2805 ) was part of the sample of @xcite , who used a red passband centered at 6500 .",
    "figure  [ fig : baghst ] shows the available data for the 19 galaxies . for each galaxy ,",
    "the left panel contains the wfpc2 i - band sbps ; the right panel contains the panbg data for each galaxy .",
    "the ordering of the galaxies in the figure and the solid lines in the panels are discussed in   [ subsec : seq ] below . in order to normalize both datasets , we shifted the ( v - band ) panbg profiles by the amount needed to match the average i - band surface brightness in the region between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "typical offsets were in the range @xmath15 .",
    "this is not unreasonable , given that the typical integrated color of galaxies of these hubble types is @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the colors that we infer appear to be somewhat too red , probably indicating a systematic offset between the two datasets in their photometric calibration .",
    "however , in this study , we are interested mainly in the structural properties of the light distribution and this problem therefore does not affect our analysis .",
    "there are a few limitations to the combined data set thus obtained .",
    "for one , the panbg profiles were derived from simple cuts along the galaxy major or minor axis , rather than from azimuthally averaged isophote fitting methods ( which is what we used for the hst data ) .",
    "the panbg profiles are therefore affected by spiral arms , dust lanes , star forming regions , or other asymmetries , even though we made every attempt to minimize these by selecting the least - affected semi - axes .",
    "also , possible mass - to - light variations or color gradients could complicate the direct comparison of the two sbps .",
    "however , the results of @xcite and @xcite have shown that color gradients in late - type disks are generally small , with variations in ( b - i ) of @xmath17mag over a few scalelengths .",
    "it thus appears that - except for the very center - the stellar populations of late - type disks are rather uniform , and our approach of profile matching seems justified . in summary",
    ", the panbg profiles should yield a fairly robust impression of the sbp of the outer disk .",
    "they are certainly useful for comparison to our wfpc2 images , especially to test whether the central @xmath18 are representative for the profile of the stellar disk .",
    "although the galaxies in our sample were selected as a fairly homogeneous group with respect to hubble type , distance , and inclination , the sbps show a wide range of shapes . to address this quantitatively , we started by fitting for each galaxy an exponential profile to the i - band sbps inside the pc field",
    ". we will refer to this as the ` inner exponential fit ' . in this fit we always excluded the nuclear cluster , as well as any ` central excess emission ' ( the definition and nature of which is discussed below ) , if present .",
    "the fits are shown as solid lines in the left panel of each plot .",
    "we show the same exponential fit also in the right panel of each plot ( so the solid line in the right panel is _ not _ a fit to the panbg data , but only the continuation of the fit in the left panel ) .",
    "the extent to which the inner exponential fit describes the data at the different radii differs considerably for the different galaxies . to illustrate this point ,",
    "we have ordered the galaxies in figure  [ fig : baghst ] in a rough sequence , according to the following scheme .",
    "the sequence starts with galaxies for which there is no evidence for a bulge of other inner component in the sbp , except for the nuclear star cluster ( which has a typical hwhm radius of @xmath19 ; paper i ) .",
    "this group itself is somewhat heterogeneous .",
    "for some galaxies the inner exponential fit yields a good description of the large - scale stellar disk as measured by the panbg profiles ( e.g. , ngc428 ) .",
    "these galaxies are fairly well described by a single exponential . for other galaxies ( e.g. , ngc4299 )",
    ", the outer disk falls below the inner exponential fit , which implies that the sbp at small radii falls _",
    "below _ the inward extrapolation of the outer disk .",
    "this is exactly opposite to what one would expect if a bulge were present ( see    [ subsec : really ] below ) .",
    "we interpret both types of galaxy as pure disk systems .",
    "interestingly , these pure disks have sbps that can differ from a single exponential .",
    "progressing along the sequence , the profiles show an increasing amount of light in excess of the inner exponential fit on radial scales of a few hundred pc ( the affected radii were excluded from the inner exponential fit ) .",
    "we refer to this light as ` central excess emission ' .",
    "this emission has a distinct profile shape : while the overall galaxy profile steepens towards the center , the excess component flattens towards the center ( see , e.g. , ngc275 , ngc2139 , or ngc3346 ) .",
    "this is different from what one would expect for a bulge .",
    "bulges tend to have @xmath0 profiles with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "such profiles steepen towards the center , when plotted as a function of ( linear ) @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , we interpret the central excess emission as a phenomenon that is different from a central bulge .",
    "we discuss this component further in ",
    "[ subsec : exc ] .",
    "approximately halfway along the sequence the outward extrapolation of the inner exponential fit begins to underpredict considerably the true brightness of the outer disk ( e.g. , ngc5068 ) .",
    "conversely , this implies that there is excess light in the central few kpc over the inward extrapolation of the outer disk .",
    "this is the component that is traditionally called a bulge .",
    "we discuss the nature of this component further in ",
    "[ subsec : really ] .",
    "given the narrow range of hubble types of our sample ( between scd and sm ) , and the uniformity in inclination ( less than @xmath22 from face - on ) , the variety of profile shapes is somewhat surprising .",
    "in addition , there seems to be no clear trend of position along our sequence with either hubble type or galaxy luminosity .",
    "for example , the profiles of ngc275 and ngc1042 are very different , even though both galaxies have nearly identical hubble type ( sb(rs)cd vs. sab(rs)cd ) and total blue magnitude ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "clearly , late - type spirals are not simple systems , their morphologies ( and possibly evolutionary states ) can differ drastically .",
    "a considerable source of confusion in discussions of bulges is that different definitions are often used when referring to a bulge .",
    "modern theorists tend to think of a bulge as a kinematically hot component with an extended three - dimensional structure .",
    "however , the observational definition of a bulge is often a different one , and relies on the assumption that bulges have different sbps than disks .",
    "the standard wisdom is that a disk can be well fit by an exponential profile , @xmath24 .",
    "by contrast , bulges can be described empirically with either a second exponential with different scale length ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , a de vaucouleurs @xmath1 profile ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , or most generally , a srsic @xmath0 profile ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if one defines a bulge as ` the central concentration of mass [ or light ] in excess of the inward extrapolation of the outer , constant scale - length , exponential disk ' @xcite , one must make sure that exponential profiles indeed provide a highly accurate description of galaxy disks .",
    "here one is on shaky ground .",
    "the exponential model has been widely used to describe galaxy disks because it provides a fairly good fit to many observed galaxy profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the fits are generally restricted to the region outside the central few kpc , so that it is actually very hard to know whether disks remain exponential all the way into the center .",
    "the disks of many late - type spirals in fact show sharp , well - defined `` breaks '' in their brightness profiles , which separate sections of the disk that follow exponential profiles with different scale lengths @xcite .",
    "so observationally , it is not at all clear how photometry alone can distinguish between an exponential bulge and a somewhat steeper disk section in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "theoretical considerations also do not clinch the argument .",
    "there is no theory that unequivocally predicts that disks must be exponential . as an ` a posteriori ' explanation ,",
    "( semi-)analytical models that invoke angular momentum redistribution via viscosity - driven radial gas flows can provide a plausible mechanism for building profile shapes close ( but not identical ) to an exponential .",
    "this has been demonstrated in the initial work by @xcite and @xcite , and recently confirmed by the refined study of @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario which invokes self - propagating stochastic star formation in a disk of constant density atomic hydrogen gas @xcite also results in brightness profiles that approximate the exponential shape",
    ". however , all these models are dependent on a number of parameters , which can be fine - tuned to reproduce a range of profile shapes .",
    "in fact , most model profiles presented by @xcite show significant curvature at all radii . it is therefore not obvious that a simple exponential is a good analytic model for disks to begin with .    in order to demonstrate the ambiguity of profile decompositions , and the ensuing interpretation of the derived `` bulge '' properties ,",
    "we have compared two different fits to the combined ( wfpc2 plus panbg ) datasets , excluding again the nuclear cluster .",
    "the two models are : ( a ) a single srsic profile ; and ( b ) the sum of two exponentials of different scale lengths .",
    "interestingly , we find that most galaxies in the second half of our sequence are equally well fit with either model , thus questioning the need for a `` bulge '' component .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : comps ] which compares these two fits for five galaxies with apparent disk - bulge transitions . in most cases",
    "the two profiles provide equally adequate fits , and for one galaxy , ngc5668 , the srsic profile provides an obviously better fit . only for one galaxy ,",
    "ngc1042 , does a sum of two exponentials provide the better fit .",
    "overall , we find that roughly half of our sample galaxies show excess light ( over the inward extrapolation of the outer exponential disk ) that can be fit by a second exponential .",
    "this is similar to the ` pseudo bulges ' or ` exponential bulges ' that have been reported by other authors , mostly in earlier type spirals .",
    "however , the extent to which this excess light is associated with a bona - fide bulge component remains an open question .",
    "the sbps of these galaxies are generally well fit with srsic profiles with @xmath25@xmath26 ( as listed in the panels of figure  [ fig : comps ] ) . in the absence of information on kinematics or three - dimensional",
    "structure it is difficult to rule out that we are dealing merely with non - exponential disks , or possibly small - scale stellar bars which are known to also have exponential - like sbps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as described in   [ subsec : seq ] , several galaxies of our sample show evidence for central excess emission on scales of a few hundred pc which does not show the steepening characteristic of bulges . in order to investigate the nature of this emission ,",
    "we have measured the amount of excess light for four example cases ( ngc275 , ngc2139 , ngc3346 and ngc5584 ) .",
    "we first determined by eye the radius @xmath27 at which the sbp starts to deviate from the inward extrapolation of the exponential fit .",
    "we then analyzed the wfpc2 i - band images presented in paper  i with the _ iraf _ photometry package _ apphot _ in order to measure the total flux within a circular aperture of radius @xmath27 , centered on the nuclear star cluster . to give a better visual impression of the four case studies , figure  [ fig : four ] reproduces their images presented in paper i. here , we have overlaid circles with radius @xmath27 to indicate the aperture over which we measure the excess emission .",
    "also , we have slightly modified the grey scale stretch to emphasize the disk structure rather than the nuclear cluster .    from the total flux inside @xmath27 ,",
    "we subtract the contribution of the galaxy disk which is calculated by integrating the exponential fit ( the solid lines in figure  [ fig : baghst ] ) inside @xmath27 .",
    "we also subtract the light from the nuclear cluster as listed in paper  i , which usually constitutes only a small correction .",
    "table  [ tab : excess ] summarizes the results of this analysis . for the four galaxies of figure  [ fig : four ] ,",
    "the apparent magnitude of the excess emission is in the range @xmath28 which corresponds to luminosities between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this is between 10 and 100 times brighter than the median luminosity of the nuclear star cluster in our sample ( @xmath31 or @xmath32 , paper i ) , but constitutes only between 1% and 5% of the total galaxy luminosity .",
    "it is interesting that with absolute luminosities of @xmath33 ( using the distances in table  [ tab : excess ] ) , this excess emission appears to be a faint end continuation of the distribution of spiral bulge luminosities shown in figure14 of @xcite , if one assumes a mean color of @xmath34 .    the images in figure",
    "[ fig : four ] reveal a variety of morphologies for the excess emission . for ngc275 , ngc5584 , and ngc3346 , the emission appears fairly smooth and follows the larger scale disk structure .",
    "however , this is clearly not the case for ngc2139 , for which the observed excess emission ( which is also by far the brightest in our sample ) is due to a prominent , bright star forming region which is elongated in the e - w direction .",
    "inspection of the wf chips shows that this structure is the inward continuation of at least one spiral arm ( the other direction is off the wfpc2 field of view ) .",
    "this underlines the danger of relying solely on one - dimensional surface brightness data for evaluating galaxy morphology .",
    "we have presented an investigation into the structural properties of 19 spiral galaxies with hubble type between scd and sm . from a combination of our high - resolution hst data and wide - field ground - based images ,",
    "we obtain surface brightness profiles ( sbps ) for the sample galaxies that cover a large dynamic range in galactic radius .",
    "we use these profiles to study quantitatively the presence and properties of bulges in spiral galaxies of the very latest hubble types .",
    "of course , by the very definition of the hubble sequence , one does not expect very prominent bulges in these galaxies .",
    "however , it has been somewhat of an open question whether bulges are present at all in these galaxies .",
    "it has been realized only recently that space - based resolution is required to properly address this question .",
    "the nuclear morphologies of most spiral galaxies are complex , and a large fraction of spiral galaxies has a nuclear star cluster .",
    "these clusters are easily mistaken for `` compact bulges '' when observed with ground - based resolution .",
    "previous studies with the hst have focused in majority on earlier hubble types , and the present study is the first to focus exclusively on the very latest hubble types .",
    "approximately 30% of the sample galaxies seem to be more - or - less `` pure '' exponential disks , without any type of a central bulge .",
    "our sample was selected to focus on face - on galaxies , but studies of edge - on galaxies support the view that disk galaxies can indeed be completely bulgeless . @xcite and @xcite have studied edge - on `` super - thin '' galaxies such as ugc7321 , and have demonstrated that in these galaxies there is no evidence for a spheroidal component .    despite being disk - dominated systems ,",
    "most galaxies in our sample have sbps that can not be well fit by a single exponential , in the sense that the surface brightness in the central few kpc exceeds the inward extrapolation of the outer exponential disk .",
    "this has generally been found for other samples of spirals as well , and has generally prompted the addition of a bulge component to analytic models of the sbp .",
    "in particular , numerous studies have shown that the sbps of intermediate- to late - type spirals can be well fit by a sum of two exponentials .",
    "the inner exponential has traditionally been interpreted as an ` exponential ' bulge or ` pseudo ' bulge .",
    "such bulges can be ( qualitatively ) explained theoretically as a result of secular evolution of the disk . while this may be correct , we point out that this is not an unambiguous interpretation . in the absence of information on three - dimensional structure or dynamics",
    "there is no guarantee that one is dealing with a bona - fide bulge component .",
    "we explicitly illustrate this point for the galaxies in our sample that are not well fit by a single exponential .",
    "indeed , the sbps of these galaxies are generally well fit by a sum of two exponentials .",
    "however , most profiles can be described at least equally well with a srsic - type @xmath0 model over the entire radial range ( outside the nuclear star cluster ) .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath3 is in the range @xmath35 , which is not unrealistically large . as we have discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : really ] , there is no a priori theoretical reason for the sbps of disk galaxies to be pure exponentials ; srsic - type profiles are in some sense equally arbitrary as the model of choice .",
    "so it may well be that we are simply dealing with non - exponential disks in most of our sample galaxies , and that bona - fide bulges are rare at these hubble types .",
    "we have found that a number of late - type galaxies show central excess emission on spatial scales of a few hundred parsec that can be attributed neither to the nuclear cluster , nor to the srsic - type description of the stellar disk , nor to what one would generally consider to be a bulge component .",
    "the origin of this light component remains unclear .",
    "one of the interesting findings from our work is that , despite the narrow range in hubble type , the sbps of the sample galaxies are far from uniform .",
    "our study finds no systematic trends in the structural properties with morphological type .",
    "the exact hubble type of spirals between scd and sm appears somewhat arbitrary , in the sense that it provides little information about the presence and relative importance of galaxy bulges .",
    "it is quite possible that this may be due to the presence of nuclear clusters , which may have played an important role in the morphological classification in photographic catalogs .",
    "in general our results fit in well with the picture that emerged from a ground - based imaging study of 49 late - type spirals by @xcite .",
    "they found that late - type spirals exhibit a diverse array of structural properties and morphologies , even in galaxies with otherwise similar parameters , and they concluded that bulges are often very weak or non - existent . in studies of this kind",
    "one does need to be concerned about selection effects and observational bias .",
    "the @xcite sample was selected for low galaxy luminosity ( @xmath36 ) , and one might worry that it did not provide a representative view of the family of very late - type spirals . our galaxy sample , on the other hand , has been selected only for hubble type , distance , and inclination .",
    "it thus includes more luminous ( and presumably more massive ) galaxies than the @xcite sample .",
    "the blue absolute luminosity of the galaxies in our sample ranges from @xmath37 ( ngc2552 , ngc4701 ) to @xmath38 ( ngc2805 ) .",
    "however , we find no systematic correlation between absolute luminosity and position along the sequence of sbp shapes discussed in  [ subsec : seq ] .",
    "this suggests that more luminous late - type spirals are not systematically different from their faint - end relatives , and that presumably the @xcite results are valid for most late - type spirals .",
    "late type spiral galaxies are in most ways `` normal '' spiral galaxies .",
    "their angular momenta and rotation velocities are not atypical , as demonstrated by a recent survey of optical rotation curves @xcite .",
    "they are in some sense the dynamically simplest type of disk galaxies .",
    "they are ( mostly ) disk - dominated and often have only faint spiral arm structure or even no detectable density perturbations at all . yet , we are clearly a long way from understanding their formation and evolution .",
    "the latest - type disk galaxies provide the most stringent observational constraints on the well - known angular momentum problem in cold dark matter ( cdm ) galaxy formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because of their unevolved disks and apparent history of only modest star formation , they are a challenge for proposed solutions for the angular momentum problem which rely on energy feedback from supernova explosions @xcite",
    ". to gain a better understanding of these issues it will be important to continue to improve our knowledge of the structure of late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "observational studies such as the one presented here will continue to be essential .",

    "<S> we investigate the stellar disk properties of a sample of 19 nearby spiral galaxies with low inclination and late hubble type ( scd or later ) . </S>",
    "<S> we combine our high - resolution _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> i - band observations with existing ground - based optical images to obtain surface brightness profiles that cover a high dynamic range of galactic radius . </S>",
    "<S> most of these galaxies contain a nuclear star cluster , as discussed in a separate paper . </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of the present work is to constrain the properties of stellar bulges at these extremely late hubble types . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the surface brightness profiles of the latest - type spirals are complex , with a wide range in shapes . </S>",
    "<S> we have sorted our sample in a sequence , starting with `` pure '' disk galaxies ( approximately 30% of the sample ) . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies have exponential stellar disks that extend inwards to within a few tens of pc from the nucleus , where the light from the nuclear cluster starts to dominate . </S>",
    "<S> they appear to be truly bulge - less systems . progressing along the sequence , </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies show increasingly prominent deviations from a simple exponential disk model on kpc scales . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , such deviations have prompted `` bulge - disk '' decompositions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the surface brightness profiles of these galaxies are generally well fit by adding a second ( exponential ) bulge component . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that most surface brightness profiles can be fit equally well ( or better ) with a single srsic - type @xmath0 profile over the entire radial range of the galaxy , without requiring a separate `` bulge '' component . </S>",
    "<S> we warn in a general sense against identification of bulges solely on the basis of single - band surface brightness profiles . despite the narrow range of hubble types in our sample , the surface brightness profiles are far from uniform . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between the various galaxies appear unrelated to their hubble - types , thus questioning the usefulness of the hubble - sequence for the sub - categorization of the latest - type spirals . </S>",
    "<S> a number of galaxies show central excess emission on spatial scales of a few hundred parsec that can be attributed neither to the nuclear cluster , nor to the srsic - type description of the stellar disk , nor to what one would generally consider to be a bulge component . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this light component remains unclear . </S>"
