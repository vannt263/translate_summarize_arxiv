    "detection of small oscillating magnetic fields is the cornerstone of experimental techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) @xcite and has been used in tests of physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "most atomic magnetometers ( for example , see refs.@xcite ) are designed to detect slowly varying magnetic fields and hence are not ideally suited for the aforementioned applications . in recent work ,",
    "savukov _ et al _ @xcite demonstrated a tunable , radio - frequency ( rf ) alkali vapor magnetometer , achieving a sensitivity of @xmath2 , with the sensor operating at @xmath3c .",
    "here we present an rf atomic magnetometer based on nonlinear magneto - optical rotation ( nmor ) arising due to the response of an aligned atomic ground state to a small rf magnetic field near the zeeman resonance frequency .",
    "the zeeman resonance frequency can be tuned to any desired value by adjusting the bias magnetic field , yielding sensitivity to signals of arbitrary frequency .",
    "the measurement involves a single low - power light beam ( @xmath4 ) , and based on photon shot - noise limited polarimetry , achieves a sensitivity of about @xmath1 .",
    "the magnetometer has a bandwidth of about 50 - 100 hz depending on light power .",
    "based on experimentally observed signal - to - noise ratio , we demonstrate a sensitivity of @xmath5 . despite somewhat lower sensitivity than reported in ref.@xcite , for many applications , the magnetometer described here has the significant advantage that the sensor operates much closer to room temperature ( the highest temperature used in this work was @xmath6c ) .",
    "additionally , using an aligned state rather than an oriented state produces smaller external magnetic fields which can potentially have a back reaction on the sample of interest .",
    "furthermore , the low power requirements and single beam arrangement facilitate the use of microfabrication techniques , promising for the development of compact portable atomic magnetometers @xcite",
    ".    such a magnetometer may find application in nqr as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite where the signal occurs at a fixed resonance frequency or in nmr spectroscopy where high spectral resolution is required to observe small splittings of nmr lines , due to , for example , scalar spin - spin @xmath7 coupling between nuclei of the form @xmath8 .",
    "such couplings can yield valuable information on molecular structure @xcite and can be difficult to access in high field environments where the absolute field homogeneity and differences in diamagnetic susceptibility limit the spectral resolution .",
    "hence , recent attention has been given to performing such measurements in a low field environment using broadband , low transition - temperature superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) @xcite or inductive detection @xcite .",
    "as inductive detection becomes less efficient at low frequencies , the technique described in this letter offers the possibility of significant gains in signal - to - noise ratio without requiring cryogenics .",
    "an alkali - metal vapor contained in a glass cell with anti - relaxation coated walls is placed in a @xmath9 directed bias field @xmath10 , corresponding to larmor frequency @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the bohr magneton and @xmath13 is the land factor .",
    "linearly polarized light propagating in the @xmath14 direction with polarization in the @xmath9 direction , tuned to the d1 ( @xmath15 ) transition , passes through the cell , optically pumping an aligned state , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the oscillating rf magnetic field can be resolved into components co- and counter - rotating ( parallel or antiparallel to the direction of larmor precession respectively ) , each of magnitude @xmath30 . transforming to the co - rotating frame the counter - rotating component rapidly averages to zero and the magnetic field is @xmath31 in steady state , an equilibrium is reached between optical pumping of alignment along the @xmath9 axis , precession around @xmath32 and relaxation , resulting in an aligned state tilted away from the @xmath9 axis , as shown inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : levelscheme ] . when @xmath33 , the @xmath9 component in eq . vanishes resulting in the maximum angle between the aligned state and the @xmath9 axis . when we transform back into the lab frame , the tilted alignment precesses about the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the tilted alignment generates optical rotation through linear dichroism ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , maximal when the alignment is in the @xmath34 plane and none when it is in the @xmath35 plane , resulting in polarization rotation of the light beam that is modulated at @xmath36 .",
    "the amplitude of the polarization rotation is linear in @xmath37 in the range @xmath38 considered here , as we have verified experimentally .",
    "the description becomes slightly more complicated for conditions of high light power and light frequency detuned from optical resonance .",
    "under these conditions , ac stark shifts can lead to differential shifts of the ground state energy levels . in conjunction with precession in the rf magnetic field , this results in alignment - to - orientation conversion ( aoc ) ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) in the rotating frame and a splitting of the rf nmor resonance as discussed briefly below .",
    "doppler broadening can also lead to aoc effects , even for resonant light @xcite .",
    "an additional high light power effect is the generation of hexadecapole ( rank 4 ) polarization moments @xcite .",
    "we find experimentally that optimal sensitivity is achieved when the saturation parameter is close to unity , and density matrix calculations indicate that the hexadecapole contribution to the ground state polarization is small compared to that of the quadrupole contribution for these conditions .",
