    "compared to unidirectional relaying , bidirectional ( two - way ) relaying is a more suitable alternative for applications where the end nodes intend to exchange information ( e.g. , in interacive applications ) @xcite .",
    "bidirectional relaying is also spectrally more efficient than unidirectional relaying , because it exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless medium @xcite .",
    "the relay combines two unidirectional unicast transmissions into a single broadcast transmission using the network coding concept @xcite . the time - division broadcast ( tdbc )",
    "protocol is the most important three - phase bidirectional decode - and - forwad ( df ) relaying scheme .",
    "it increases spectral efficiency by 33% compared to unidirectional relaying @xcite .",
    "papers @xcite and @xcite study the capacity outage probability ( op ) of the tdbc protocol .",
    "the op well describes the behaviour of a system that operates at fixed information rates over quasi - static ( i.e. , slowly fading ) channels , where the rate is selected such that each codeword is transmitted over one channel realization .",
    "fixed - rate communication is suitable for delay - sensitive applications , such as , bidirectional interactive speech and/or video communication .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite assume that the end nodes and the relay transmit at fixed output powers , although they have to have instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) available as this is required for decoding . apart from decoding , this csi",
    "can also be used for power adaptation at the relay and the end nodes such that outage minimization is achieved under some _ ( long - term ) average power _ constraint . unlike the more restrictive short - term power constraint that limits the codeword power for each channel realization , the average power constraints limit the average power of all codewords over all channel realizations @xcite . for point - to - point channels ,",
    "such power adaptation is known as _ truncated channel inversion _ and has been introduced in @xcite . for unidirectional relaying , optimal power allocation for source and relay has been studied for both conventional amplify - and - forward r7 and decode - and - forward ( df ) @xcite relaying systems under various average power constraints .",
    "optimal power allocation has been shown to introduce significant performance improvement relative to constant power transmissions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , literature does not offer similar results for bidirectional relaying .    in this work , we derive power control strategyies for the end - nodes and the relay in three - phase bidirectional df relaying . for predefined constant rates in both directions ,",
    "the proposed power allocation achieves minimization of the system op assuming individual average power constraints at the end nodes and the relay . for the power allocation ,",
    "the end nodes use the instantaneous csi of their respective source - relay links and the relay uses the instantaneous csi of both links . intuitively , it is not necessary for the end nodes and the relay to transmit at their maximum available power in each transmission cycle , but transmit with the minimum power required to avoid outages , or sometimes even be silent when an outage is unavoidable , thus conserving their power .",
    "in other words , we allow outages to occur in cases of deep fades , but for the rest of the time we ensure successful transmissions at the predefined constant transmission rate .",
    "the considered bidirectional relaying system consists of two end - nodes ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and a half - duplex df relay @xmath2 .",
    "the bidirectional communication consists of two parallel unidirectional communication sessions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "each communication session is realized at a fixed information rate , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we assume the direct @xmath7 link is not available , thus , the bidirectional communication is realized only via the relayed link .",
    "the op for this system is defined as the probability that at least one ( or both ) of the communications sessions is in outage .",
    "the squared amplitudes of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and have arbitrary average values @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the @xmath14 channel is reciprocal to the @xmath8 channel , and the @xmath15 channel is reciprocal to the @xmath16 channel .",
    "we adopt the rayleigh block fading model , which means that the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constant within each transmission cycle , but change from one transmission cycle to the next .",
    "thus , in each transmission cycle , the pair @xmath17 denotes the channel state , where both @xmath18 and @xmath11 follow the rayleigh probability distribution function ( pdf ) .    each transmission cycle",
    "is divided into three phases : in phase 1 , @xmath19transmits its codeword @xmath20 at information rate @xmath5 with an output power @xmath21 , and the df relay receives . in phase 2",
    ", @xmath1 transmits its codeword @xmath22 at information rate @xmath23 with an output power @xmath24 , and the df relay receives .",
    "the relay attempts to decode both codewords @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "if it successfully decodes both of them , the relay generates a single composite codeword that carries the information of both @xmath20 and @xmath22 r2 .",
    "then , in phase 3 , the relay broadcasts the composite codeword towards the end nodes with an output power @xmath25 .",
    "note that the output powers from the end nodes and the relay have been written as functions of the channel state . in each transmission cycle",
    ", node @xmath0 is assumed to know only the value of @xmath10 , whereas node @xmath1 is assumed to know only the value of @xmath11 .",
    "based on this csi knowledge , each end node can `` subtract ''",
    "its own codeword from the received codeword , and then attempt to decode the noisy version of the codeword that originates from the other node . the df relay can decode both codewords since it is assumed to know both @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the received signals at the end nodes and the relay are corrupted by additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "we present optimal power allocation ( opa ) strategies at the end nodes and the relay that minimize the system op , subject to the individual average power constraints @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 at @xmath19 , @xmath1 , and the relay . in phase 1",
    ", @xmath19 uses power control based on its knowledge of @xmath10 so as to achieve truncated channel inversion of the @xmath8 channel at rate @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "similarly , in phase 2 , @xmath29 uses power control based on its knowledge of @xmath11 so as to achieve truncated channel inversion of the @xmath9 channel at rate @xmath23 . in phase 3 ,",
    "if both codewords @xmath20 and @xmath22 are successfully decoded by the relay , the adopted power control  mechanism minimizes the op over the broadcast channel ( section iv ) .",
    "the @xmath8 channel can support @xmath19 s transmission rate , @xmath5 , if the instantaneous capacity of the channel between @xmath19 and the relay exceeds this rate , @xmath30where the the pre - log factor @xmath31 is due to the three - phase transmission cycle . for an available average power of end node @xmath19 of @xmath32 , the opa strategy at @xmath19",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath33where @xmath34 . in ( [ eq2 ] )",
    ", the cutoff threshold @xmath35 is determined from @xmath36the right hand side of ( [ eq3 ] ) is valid for rayleigh fading , where @xmath37 is the exponential integral function @xcite .",
    "analogously , the @xmath9 channel can support @xmath1 s transmission rate , @xmath6 , with its average output power @xmath27 , if the instantaneous capacity of the channel between @xmath1 and the relay exceeds this rate , @xmath38which leads to the opa strategy at @xmath1 , @xmath39where @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding cutoff threshold @xmath41 is determined from @xmath42",
    "considering ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , the relay successfully decodes both codewords @xmath20 and @xmath22 only if @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the relay s non - outage region defined as @xmath45 in this case , the relay generates the composite signal , and , in phase 3 broadcasts the composite codeword towards the end nodes with an output power @xmath25 .",
    "the solution of the optimization problem@xmath46 @xmath47    is given by @xmath48    optimization problem ( [ 7a ] ) is a standard _ linear programming _ ( lp ) problem , whose solution is feasible because the intersection of the constraints is a non - empty set , and it lies at the boundary of the intersection , given by ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "if the relay successfully decodes both codewords , i.e. , @xmath49 , the power adaptation ( [ 10 ] ) guarantees zero outages in the broadcase phase with minimum output power from the relay , because both end nodes can successfully decode their intended codewords in the broadcast phase .",
    "if @xmath50 , the relay should be silent as it can not decode at least one of the two codewords .",
    "assuming power control accoding to ( [ 10 ] ) , the relay s non - outage region @xmath44 is divided into two non - overlaping regions , @xmath51 , such that @xmath52 @xmath53if @xmath54 , the relay transmits with power @xmath55 , whereas if @xmath56 , the relay transmits with power @xmath57 . figs .",
