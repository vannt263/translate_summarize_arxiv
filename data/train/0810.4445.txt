    "one way of realizing theories describing gravity as a truly higher - dimensional interaction becoming effectively 4d at low - enough energies is represented by the braneworld models , where the observable universe is a 3-brane ( domain wall ) to which the standard model ( non - gravitational ) matter fields are confined , while gravity field enters the extra spatial dimensions the size of which may be much larger than the planck length scale @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as shown by randall and sundrum @xcite , gravity can be localized near the brane at low energies even with a non - compact , infinite size extra dimension with the warped spacetime satisfying the 5d einstein equations with negative cosmological constant .",
    "then an arbitrary energy - momentum tensor could be allowed on the brane @xcite .",
    "the randall - sundrum model gives 4d einstein gravity in low energy limit , and the conventional potential of newtonian gravity appears on the 3-brane with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "significant deviations from the einstein gravity occur at very high energies , e.g. , in the very early universe , and in vicinity of compact objects @xcite .",
    "gravitational collapse of matter trapped on the brane results in black holes mainly localized on the brane , but their horizon could be extended into the extra dimension .",
    "the high - energy effects produced by the gravitational collapse are disconnected from the outside space by the horizon , but they could have a signature on the brane , influencing properties of black holes @xcite .",
    "there are high - energy effects of local character influencing pressure in collapsing matter , and also non - local corrections of `` backreaction '' character arising from the influence of the weyl curvature of the bulk space on the brane  the matter on the brane induces weyl curvature in the bulk which makes influence on the structures on the brane due to the bulk graviton stresses @xcite . the combination of high - energy ( local ) and bulk stress ( non - local ) effects alters significantly the matching problem on the brane , compared to the 4d einstein gravity ; for spherical objects , matching no longer leads to a schwarzschild exterior in general @xcite .",
    "the weyl stresses induced by bulk gravitons imply that the matching conditions do not have unique solution on the brane ; in fact , knowledge of the 5d weyl tensor is needed as a minimum condition for uniqueness @xcite . some solutions for spherically symmetric black holes",
    "@xcite and uniform density stars @xcite have been discussed .",
    "it has been shown that in the black hole case the matching conditions could be satisfied and the bulk effects on the black hole spacetimes could be represented by a single  brany  parameter .",
    "assuming spherically symmetric metric induced on the 3-brane , the constrained effective gravitational field equations on the brane could be solved , giving reissner - nordstrm static black hole solutions endowed with a braneworld parameter @xmath1 having character of a `` tidal '' charge , instead of the standard electric charge parameter @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the tidal charge can be both positive and negative , however , there are some indications that negative tidal charge should properly represent the `` backreaction '' effects of the bulk space weyl tensor on the brane @xcite .",
    "the stationary and axisymmetric solutions describing rotating black holes localized in the randall - sundrum braneworld were derived in @xcite , having the metric tensor of the kerr - newman form with a tidal charge describing the 5d correction term generated by the 5d weyl tensor stresses .",
    "the tidal charge has an `` electric '' character again and arises due to the 5d gravitational coupling between the brane and the bulk , reflected on the brane through the `` electric '' part of the bulk weyl tensor @xcite , in analogy with the spherically symmetric case @xcite .",
    "when both the tidal and electric charge are present the black hole spacetime structure is much more complex and additional off - diagonal metric components @xmath3 , @xmath4 are relevant along with the standard @xmath5 component , due to the combination of the local bulk effects and the rotational dragging .",
    "this distorts the event horizon which becomes a stack of non - uniformly rotating null circles having different radii at fixed @xmath6 while going from the equatorial plane to the poles @xcite .",
    "the uniformly rotating horizon is recovered for the rotation parameter @xmath7 small enough where kerr - newman form of the metric tensor is allowed describing charged and slowly rotating black holes @xcite . in the absence of rotation",
    ", the metric tensor reduces to the reissner - nordstrm form with correction term of non - local origin @xcite .    here",
    "we restrict our attention to the kerr - newman type of solutions describing the braneworld rotating black holes with no electric charge , since in astrophysically relevant situations the electric charge of the black hole must be exactly zero , or very small @xcite . then the results obtained in analysing the behaviour of test particles and photons or test fields around the kerr - newman black holes could be used assuming both positive and negative values of the braneworld tidal parameter @xmath1 ( used instead of charge parameter @xmath2 ) .",
    "the information on the properties of strong gravitational fields in vicinity of compact objects , namely of black holes , is encoded into optical phenomena of different kind that enable us to make estimates of the black hole parameters , including its tidal charge , when predictions of the theoretical models are confronted with the observed data . from this point of view",

    "observer is at @xmath139kpc lying in the equatorial plane.,width=230 ]    in the case of spherically symmetric black holes , the influence of the tidal charge parameter @xmath1 on the silhuette diameter can be given by the simple formula for impact parameter of photon circular orbits that reads @xcite    @xmath140    where    @xmath141    the resulting dependence of the diameter @xmath142 is illustrated in figure [ diameter_of_silhuette_schw ] .",
    "the diameter grows slowly with the descending of @xmath1 ; notice that its magnitude is twice the pure schwarzchild value for @xmath143 .",
    "of course , for rotating black holes the silhuette is maximally deformed due to the influence of rotation since the viewing angle @xmath144 and is given by calculations and results presented above .",
    "testing of the combined spin and tidal charge influence would be possible with measurement precision enlarged for 1-order relative to the recently expected state mentioned above .",

    "width=230 ]    considering the time delay effects , the exact value of @xmath119 is crucial since it plays a fundamental role in determining the time delay effect whose scale is given by the value of @xmath148 .",
    "we illustrate the influence of the tidal charge on the time delay effects at the astrophysically important radii corresponding to marginally stable circular geodesics , i.e. in the strong gravity regime , for two representative fixed values of black hole spin ( see figure [ td_table4 ] and table [ tabulka2 ] ) .",
    "we can expect importance of the regions close to @xmath147 for relevant optical effects due to the idea of the low angular momentum accretion in sgr @xmath10 advocated by b. czerny @xcite .",
    "clearly , we can see in figure [ td_table4 ] that the time delay effects could be well measurable and the tidal charge influence could be well tested , if the black hole spin is properly estimated .",
    "one of the most promising ways of estimating influence of hypothetical hidden external dimensions , considered in the framework of the braneworld model with infinite external dimension as developed by @xcite , seems to be investigation of the optical phenomena caused by the black hole backgrounds .",
    "it is so because black holes represent the only case when the non - local influence of the bulk space on the braneworld spacetime structure can be fully described by a single , braneworld parameter called tidal charge , the sign of which can be both positive and negative , with the second possibility beeing more realistic one @xcite .    here , we focused our attention to developing a theoretical background for treating the optical phenomena in vicinity of braneworld rotating black holes and bringing general tendencies of the tidal charge effect in some basical optical phenomena .",
    "we have shown qualitatively how the braneworld tidal charge affects the basical optical phenomena , especially the black - hole silhuette , the accretion disc image with the frequency shift of area of the disc radiating at a specific frequency , and the time delay between the direct and indirect images of the hot spot orbiting the black hole .",
    "we have shown that these phenomena could be measured and used to put limits on the tidal charge in case of galaxy center sgr @xmath10 supermassive black hole .",
    "we generalized the approaches based on the transfer - function method as introduced and developed in schwarzchild and kerr backgrounds @xcite where equations of photon motion are solved in terms of the elliptic integrals ( see @xcite ) . for purposes of the present work",
    ", the transfer - function method seems to be most efficient .",
    "nevertheless , we prepared the ray - tracing method too , since that could be usefull in treating other optical phenomena .",
    "generally , rising negative value of the tidal charge strenghtens the black hole field and suppresses the rotational phenomena , when the black - hole rotation parameter is fixed .",
    "the magnitude of the optical phenomena grows with decreasing of the negatively - valued tidal charge , but the rotation induced asymmetry of the phenomena like the black - hole silhuette , or the accretion disc image , decreases .",
    "the black - hole silhuette is characterized by two parameters , namely the shift of the center and ellipticity , that could be in principle measurable in the galactic center black - hole system sgr @xmath10 , after expected development of observational techniques that at present enable measurement of the black hole diameter , not details of the shape .",
    "the galaxy center ( sgr @xmath10 ) seems to be also a promising candidate for testing the time delay effects both for phenomena related to the accretion disc and flares observed there , and for some expected lensing phenomena connected to the observed stars orbiting the sgr @xmath10 central black hole .    we have found that observable phenomena could be expected for the time - delay effects .",
    "of special interest is comparison of time delays generated for sources in vicinity of the sgr @xmath10 black hole ( both stars and disc hot spots ) and those related to weak lensing of some distant sources @xcite .",
    "similarly , keeping rotational parameter fixed , the negative tidal charge has tendency to make the isoradial curve images ( both direct and indirect ) larger and less deformed while the positive tidal charge influence is of opposite character . on the other hand , for fixed rotational parameter of the black hole and disc radiating at the innermost part above the innermost stable orbit at @xmath149 , the negative tidal charge restricts the radiating ring image simply because the radius @xmath147 grows with decreasing value of braneworld parameter @xmath1 .",
    "suppresion of the relativistic effects can be measurable also in the spectral line profiles generated by the inner hot part of the disc radiating at special x - ray line @xcite .",
    "the optical tests have to be confronted with the data obtained from quasiperiodic oscillations observed in some black - hole systems ( microquasars @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital resonance model gives good estimates of the black - hole parameters @xcite ; this model has been recently generalized to the case of braneworld kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "it is shown that in the case of microquasar grs 1915 + 105 and galactic center sgr @xmath10 black holes with the negative braneworld parameter @xmath1 are allowed by the observational data @xcite .",
    "detailed modelling of optical phenomena connected to the oscillating discs or orbiting ( oscillating ) hot spots and related resonant phenomena between the oscillation modes could be very promising in putting limits on allowed values of the tidal charge of the black hole .",
