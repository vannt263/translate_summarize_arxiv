    "a major obstacle to a symplectic theory of finite dimensional integrable hamiltonian systems is that _ differential topological _ and _ symplectic _ problems appear side by side , but smooth and symplectic methods do not always mesh well .",
    "morse - bott theory represents a success in bringing together in a cohesive way continuous and differential tools , and it has been used effectively to study properties of dynamical systems . but incorporating symplectic information into the context of dynamical systems is far from automatic . however , many concrete examples are known for which computations , and numerical simulations , exhibit a close relationship between the symplectic dynamics of a system , and the differential topology of its bifurcation set .    in the 1980s and 1990s , the fomenko school developed a morse theory for regular energy surfaces of integrable systems . moreover ,",
    "theoretical successes ( in any dimension ) for compact periodic systems in the 1970s and 1980s by atiyah , guillemin , kostant , sternberg and others , gave hope that one can find a mathematical theory for bifurcations of integrable systems in the symplectic setting .",
    "this paper develops a symplectic bifurcation theory for integrable systems in dimension four  compact or not .",
    "because it recently has become clear that the bifurcation diagram of an integrable system is the natural setting to study symplectic invariants ( see for instance @xcite ) , this paper provides a setting for the study of quantum integrable systems .",
    "semiclassical quantization is a strong motivation for developing a systematic bifurcation theory of integrable systems ; the study of bifurcation diagrams is fundamental for the understanding of quantum spectra  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the results of this paper may have applications to mirror symmetry and symplectic topology because an integrable system without hyperbolic singularities gives rise to a toric fibration with singularities .",
    "the base space is endowed with a singular integral affine structure .",
    "these singular affine structures are studied in symplectic topology , mirror symmetry , and algebraic geometry ; for instance , they play a central role in the work of kontsevich and soibelman @xcite .",
    "we refer to section [ sec : remarks ] for further analysis of these applications , as well as a natural connection to the study of solution sets in real algebraic geometry .",
    "the development of the theory requires the introduction of methods to construct morse - bott functions which , from the point of view of symplectic geometry , behave well near the singularities of integrable systems .",
    "these methods use eliasson s theorems on linearization of non - degenerate singularities of integrable systems , and the symplectic topology of integrable systems , to which many have contributed .",
    "the first part of this paper is concerned with the connectivity of joint level sets of vector - valued maps on manifolds , when these are defined by the components of an integrable system .",
    "the most striking previous result in this direction is atiyah s 1982 theorem which guarantees the connectivity of the fibers of the momentum map when the integrable system comes from a hamiltonian torus action .",
    "the second part of the paper explains how the pioneering results proven in the seventies and eighties by atiyah , guillemin , kostant , kirwan , and sternberg describing the image of the momentum of a _ hamiltonian compact group action _ also hold in the context of integrable systems on four - dimensional manifolds , when there are no hyperbolic singularities .",
    "the conclusions of the theorems in this paper are essentially optimal .",
    "moreover , there is only one transversality assumption on the integrable system : that there should be no vertical tangencies on the bifurcation set , up to diffeomorphism .",
    "if this condition is violated then there are examples which show that one can not hope for any fiber connectivity .    the work of atiyah , guillemin , kostant , kirwan , and sternberg exhibited connections between symplectic geometry , combinatorics , representation theory , and algebraic geometry .",
    "their work guarantees the convexity of the image of the momentum map ( intersected with the positive weyl chamber if the compact group is non - commutative ) .",
    "although this property no longer holds for general integrable systems , an explicit description of the image of the singular lagrangian fibration given by an integrable system with two degrees of freedom can be given .",
    "the understanding of this image , which corresponds to the bifurcation diagram of the dynamics in the physics literature , is essential for the description of the system , as it has proven to be the best framework to define new symplectic invariants of integrable systems , and hence to quantize ; see the recent work on semitoric integrable systems @xcite .",
    "the most striking known result for fiber connectivity of vector - valued functions is atiyah s famous connectivity theorem @xcite proved in the early eighties .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a compact , connected , symplectic , @xmath1-dimensional manifold . for smooth functions @xmath2 ,",
    "let @xmath3 be the flow of the hamiltonian vector field @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is defined by the equation @xmath5 .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the @xmath7-dimensional torus @xmath8 .",
    "suppose that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , defines a @xmath6-action on @xmath11 .",
    "then the fibers of the map @xmath12 are connected .",
    "this theorem has been generalized by a number of authors to general compact lie groups actions and more general symplectic manifolds .",
    "indeed , a hamiltonian @xmath13-torus action on a @xmath1-manifold may be viewed as a very particular integrable system .",
    "a long standing question in the integrable systems community has been to what extent atiyah s result holds for integrable systems , where checking fiber connectivity by hand is extremely difficult ( even for easily describable examples ) .",
    "this paper answers this question in the positive in dimension four : if an integrable system has no hyperbolic singularities and its bifurcation diagram has no vertical tangencies , then the fibers of the integrable system are connected .    to state this result precisely , recall that a map @xmath14 is a _ integrable hamiltonian system _ if @xmath15 are point - wise almost everywhere linearly independent and for all indices @xmath16 , the function @xmath17 is invariant along the flow of the hamiltonian vector field @xmath18 .",
    "( recall : @xmath4 is the vector field defined by @xmath5 ) .    in general , fiber connectivity is no longer true for integrable systems , due to the existence of singularities .",
    "for instance , consider the manifold is @xmath19 . choose the following coordinates on @xmath20 : @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 .",
    "choose coordinates @xmath23 on @xmath24 and let @xmath25 be the symplectic form on @xmath11 , where @xmath7 is a positive integer .",
    "the map @xmath26 , defines an integrable system .",
    "the fiber over any regular value of @xmath27 is @xmath7 copies of @xmath28 .",
    "the image @xmath29 is an annulus ( see figure  [ fig : annulus - only ] ) .     of integrable system with disconnected fibers , on the compact manifold @xmath30 .",
    "this integrable system has only singularities of elliptic and transversally elliptic type , so it is remarkable how while being quite close to be a toric system , fiber connectivity is lost.,width=170,height=170 ]    an annulus has the property that it has vertical tangencies , and it can not be deformed into a domain without such tangencies .",
    "remarkably , if such tangencies do not exist in some deformation of @xmath29 , fiber connectivity still holds .",
    "this is for instance the case for hamiltonian torus actions .",
    "next we state this precisely .    in this paper , manifolds are assumed to be @xmath31 and second countable .",
    "let us recall here some standard definitions .",
    "a map @xmath32 between topological spaces is _ proper _ if the preimage of every compact set is compact .",

    "diffeomorphism onto its image _ when @xmath38 is injective , smooth , and its inverse @xmath39 is smooth . if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are smooth manifolds , the _ bifurcation set _",
    "@xmath40 of a smooth map",
    "@xmath41 consists of the points of @xmath33 where @xmath38 is not locally trivial ( see definition [ def : bifurcation ] ) . it is known that the set of critical values of @xmath38 is included in the bifurcation set and that if @xmath38 is proper this inclusion is an equality ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.5.1 ) and the comments following it ) .",
    "second , recall that an integrable system @xmath42 is called _ non - degenerate _ if its singularities are non - degenerate ( see definition [ def : nondegpoi ] ) .",
    "if @xmath27 is proper and non - degenerate , then @xmath43 is the image of a piecewise smooth immersion of a 1-dimensional manifold ( proposition  [ prop : strata ] ) .",
    "we say that a vector in @xmath44 is _ tangent to @xmath43 _ whenever it is directed along a left limit or a right limit of the differential of the immersion .",
    "we say that the curve @xmath45 has a _ vertical tangency _ at a point @xmath46 if there is a vertical tangent vector at @xmath46 .",
    "our first main result is the following .",

    "consider @xmath801 with coordinates @xmath802 .",
    "is the solution set @xmath803 of @xmath804 connected ?",
    "in other words , is the set @xmath805 connected , where @xmath806 defined by @xmath807 one is tempted to again use morse - bott theory to check this connectivity , but morse - bott theory for which function ? _ the first goal of the present paper was to give a method to answer connectivity questions of this type in the case @xmath27 is an integrable system .",
    "_ in the paper we introduced a method to construct morse - bott functions which , from the point of view of symplectic geometry , behave well near singularities .",
    "we saw how the behavior of an integrable system near the singularities has a strong effect on the global properties of the system .",
    "the fibers of @xmath808 are , by the theorem [ theo : main - connectivity ] , connected , because its image can be easily seen to be given by example  [ fig : example ] .",
    "the question answered by theorem  [ theo : main - connectivity ] is probably the most basic _ topological _ question to ask about a solution set ( except for its non - emptyness ) .",
    "semiclassical quantization is a strong motivation for undergoing the systematic study of integrable systems in this paper .",
    "consider the quantum version of the connectivity problem .",
    "the functions @xmath809 are replaced by `` quantum observables '' , i.e. , self - adjoint operators @xmath810 on a hilbert space @xmath811 , and the system of fiber equations is replaced by the system @xmath812 so @xmath813 should be an eigenvalue for @xmath814 and the eigenvector @xmath264 should be the same for all @xmath815 . there is a chance to solve this when the operators @xmath814 pairwise commute .",
    "this is the quantum analogue of the poisson commutation property for the integrable system given by @xmath809 .    in the last thirty years",
    ", semiclassical analysis has pushed this idea quite far .",
    "it is known that to any regular liouville torus of the classical integrable system , one can associate a _",
    "quasimode _ for the quantum system , leading to approximate eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of bifurcation sets ( described in theorem  [ theo : main - image0 ] and theorem  [ theo : main - image ] ) is fundamental for a good understanding of the quantum spectrum .",
    "more recently , quasimodes associated to singular fibers have been constructed ; see  @xcite and the references therein . in some case , it can be shown that the quantum spectrum completely determines the classical system , see zelditch @xcite .",
    "when the system has symmetries , the quantum spectrum typically exhibits degenerate ( or almost degenerate ) eigenvalues . in the setting of integrable systems ,",
    "this is revealed by the non - connectedness of some fibers .",
    "thus , connectivity results are of primary importance from the quantum perspective .",
    "they predict almost degenerate ( or _ clusters of _ ) eigenvalues .",
    "for instance , in the inverse spectral result of  @xcite , detecting the number of connected components was the key point ( and the most subtle ) of the analysis .",
    "theorem  [ theo : main - connectivity0 ] and theorem  [ theo : main - connectivity ] may have applications to mirror symmetry and symplectic topology .",
    "an integrable system without hyperbolic singularities gives rise to a toric fibration with singularities .",
    "the base space is endowed with a singular integral affine structure .",
    "remarkably , these singular affine structures are of key importance in various parts of symplectic topology , mirror symmetry , and algebraic geometry ; for example they play a central role in the work of kontsevich and soibelman @xcite .",
    "these singular affine structures have been studied in the context of integrable systems ( in particular by nguyn tin zung  @xcite ) , but also became a central concept in the works by symington @xcite and symington - leung @xcite in the context of symplectic geometry and topology , and by gross - siebert , castao - bernard , castao - bernard - matessi @xcite , among others , in the context of mirror symmetry and algebraic geometry .",
    "fiber connectivity is ( usually ) assumed in theorems about lagrangian fibrations , so the theorem above gives a method to test whether a given result in that context applies to a lagrangian fibration arising from an integrable system .",
    "see also eliashberg - polterovich @xcite for relevant examples in the theory of symplectic quasi - states .",
    "non - degenerate integrable systems without hyperbolic singularities are prominent in the literature , both in mathematics and in physics ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "they are usually called _ almost - toric systems _ , although the choice of name is somewhat misleading as they may not have any periodicity from a circle or torus action ; on the other hand , these systems retain some properties of toric systems , at least in the compact case .",
    "the most well studied case of almost - toric system is that of toric systems coming from a hamiltonian torus actions .",
    "a proof of theorem [ theo : main - connectivity ] for the so called `` semitoric '' systems was given by the third author in @xcite using the theory of hamiltonian circle actions .",
    "semitoric systems are integrable systems on four - manifolds which have no hyperbolic singularities and for which one component of the system generates a proper periodic flow .",
    "the proof in @xcite uses in an essential way the periodicity assumption and it can not be extended , as far as we know , to deal with the general systems treated in theorem [ theo : main - connectivity ] . a classification of semitoric systems in terms of five symplectic invariants",

    "<S> this paper develops a symplectic bifurcation theory for integrable systems in dimension four . we prove that if an integrable system has no hyperbolic singularities and its bifurcation diagram has no vertical tangencies , then the fibers of the induced singular lagrangian fibration are connected . the image of this singular lagrangian fibration is , up to smooth deformations , a planar region bounded by the graphs of two continuous functions . </S>",
    "<S> the bifurcation diagram consists of the boundary points in this image plus a countable collection of rank zero singularities , which are contained in the interior of the image . </S>",
    "<S> because it recently has become clear to the mathematics and mathematical physics communities that the bifurcation diagram of an integrable system provides the best framework to study symplectic invariants , this paper provides a setting for studying quantization questions , and spectral theory of quantum integrable systems . </S>"
