    "over the years it has been found that there exist many two - dimensional classical spin models , discrete and continuous alike , whose ground - state manifolds are macroscopically degenerate and , more interestingly , also exhibit critical behaviours , i.e. , spin - spin correlation functions within the ground - state ensembles decay with distance as power laws .",
    "the classification of universality class for these models has always been a challenging problem@xcite    an earlier example of this kind is the antiferromagnetic ising model on the triangular lattice .",
    "the exact solution for this model by stephenson@xcite showed that although this model remains paramagnetic at nonzero temperature , its ground state is critical .",
    "later works by blte _",
    "et al _ revealed yet another remarkable property of the ground - state ensemble of this model , namely , it permits a solid - on - solid ( sos ) representation in which spin fluctuations are subsequently described by the fluctuating interface in the sos model@xcite .",
    "recent studies also demonstrated that this interfacial representation provides a valuable avenue for studying the ground - state ordering of quantum magnets@xcite and the ground - state roughness of oriented elastic manifolds in random media@xcite .",
    "other recently studied models with critical ground states include three - state antiferromatic potts model on the kagom lattice@xcite , the @xmath3 model on the honeycomb lattice@xcite , the four - coloring model on the square lattice@xcite , and the square - lattice non - crossing dimer model and dimer - loop model@xcite . on the other hand , some very similar models with degenerate ground states exhibit long - range order , such as the constrained 4-state potts antiferromagnet@xcite .",
    "in this article we study the ground - state properties of antiferromagnetic ising model of general spin on a triangular lattice which also belongs to the class of models mentioned above .",
    "recent numerical studies of this model include monte carlo simulations@xcite and transfer matrix calculations@xcite . here",
    "we revisit this model by performing monte carlo simulations .",
    "the motivation of the present work is two - fold : ( 1)unlike previous simulations , we utilize the interfacial representation directly in analyzing the simulation results , for example , we compute the stiffness constant of the fluctuating interface which , in turn , yields more accurate critical exponents of various operators ; and ( 2 ) we also study the dynamical properties of this model for the first time making use of the interfacial representation .",
    "the body of the this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ model ] describes the model hamiltonian and maps it onto a spin-1 problem whose interfacial representation is then described . in section [ height - rep ] ,",
    "we propose an effective continuum theory for the long - wavelength fluctuations of the interface . here",
    "we also show how to relate scaling dimensions of various operators to the stiffness constant of the interface , and derive some other analytical results based on this `` height representation . ''",
    "this allows analytical understanding of the phase diagram ( sec .",
    "[ phasediag ] ) .",
    "details of monte carlo simulations and numerical results on both dynamical and static properties are presented in section [ mc - results ] , including a comparison of the new and old approaches to determining the exponents . as a conclusion ,",
    "the paper is summarized and various possible extensions are outlined , in section [ conc - disc ] .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ising model of spin-@xmath0 on a triangular lattice can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where the spin variable @xmath5 defined on lattice site @xmath6 of the triangular lattice can take any value from a discrete set @xmath7 $ ] , and the sum over @xmath8 runs over three nearest - neighbor vectors @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . here",
    "the coupling constant @xmath12 is positive describing the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between two nearest - neighbor spins : @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "one important reason for interest in this model is that the @xmath14 limit@xcite is the same as the ising limit of the ( classical or quantum ) heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice with ising - like anisotropic exchange .",
    "that model was shown to exhibit a continuous classical ground state degeneracy and unusual features of the selection by fluctuations of ground states@xcite .",
    "the ground - state configurations of the above model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) consist of entirely of triangles on which one spin is @xmath15 , another is @xmath16 , and the third can be anything in @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "thus , if spin @xmath18 takes an intermediate value @xmath19 , this forces the six surrounding spins to alternate @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; exactly which intermediate value @xmath18 takes does not matter in determining whether a configuration is allowed .",
    "therefore , this allows us to reduce each state @xmath20 to a state @xmath21 of a _",
    "spin-1 _ model , by mapping @xmath22 to @xmath23 , @xmath24 to @xmath25 , and intermediate values @xmath26 to @xmath27 . in this _",
    "spin-1 _ representation of the model , the rules for allowed configurations are exactly the same as for the @xmath28 model ; however instead of being equal , the statistical weights have a factor @xmath29 for each spin with @xmath27 .",
    "it should be noted that in the @xmath30 case , @xmath31 simply maps to @xmath32 .",
    "it can also be shown that the expectation of any polynomial in @xmath33 , in the ground - state ensemble of the spin-@xmath0 model , can be written in terms of a similar expectation in the spin-1 model .",
    "specifically , one must simply replace @xmath34 , &                                  m even \\cr}\\ ] ] where ( e.g. ) @xmath35 .",
    "thus there is no loss of information in this mapping . indeed ,",
    "in some sense , the extra freedom to have @xmath5 vary from @xmath36 to @xmath37 is trivial : once given that @xmath5 and @xmath38 are intermediate spin values , there is no correlation between these values .",
    "so we henceforth restrict ourselves to the spin-1 mapped model whose partition function for its ground - state ensemble can be written as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the number of zero spins in a ground - state configuration @xmath41 . by varying the weight factor continuously in the spin-1 model , it would possible to give a precise meaning to _ any _ real value of @xmath0 , and to simulate such an ensemble . however ,",
    "in this article we perform monte carlo simulations for an ensemble in which @xmath42 takes only integer values .",
    "the spin-1 representation could be further reduced to a spin-1/2 representation @xmath43 as described in refs .  .",
    "they let @xmath44 here @xmath45 if @xmath32 and if @xmath27 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 according to whether the surrounding spins are @xmath48 or the reverse .",
    "note this mapping is not invertible .",
    "the spin-@xmath49 representation is less satisfactory in that is arbitrarily breaks the up - down symmetry of correlation functions , but it was desirable for the transfer - matrix calculations of lipowski _",
    "et al_@xcite since it reduced the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we define a _ microscopic",
    "_ , discrete - valued height function @xmath50 living on the vertex of the triangular lattice such that the step in @xmath50 between adjacent vertices is a function of the adjacent spins : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the spin-1 operator and @xmath53 can be any of the three nearest - neighbor vectors @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to show that the total change in height function , when traversed along any smallest loop , i.e , an elementary triangle , is zero .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 is well - defined everywhere for the ground - state configurations , but it is not well - defined in any excited state .",
    "this prescription generalizes that originally introduced by blte et al for the case @xmath30@xcite ( the prescriptions agree in that case ) .",
    "this type of height mapping differs from other sorts of mapping ( e.g. dualities ) in a crucial way : since the spin microstates of the spin-1 model are mapped essentially one - to - one to the height microstates , it is possible to perform monte carlo simulations and construct configurations @xmath50 after each time step .",
    "we have found that analysis of the @xmath50 correlations is much more efficient for extracting critical exponents than analysis of the spin correlations directly as was done in previous monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "in this section we propose an effective continuum theory which describes the long - wavelength fluctuations of the interface .",
    "we also demonstrate how the critical exponents of various operators are determined by the stiffness constant of the interface .      to describe the interface in the rough phase , we must define a smooth height field @xmath55 by coarse - graining the discrete field @xmath50 . as a first stage , on every triangular plaquette formed by sites @xmath56 , define a new discrete height @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the center of a triangle .",
    "the possible values of the @xmath59 are @xmath60 , for any integer @xmath61 .",
    "( for the case @xmath30 , the only possible values are integers . )",
    "to each of these values corresponds a _",
    "unique _ ground - state spin configuration of the spin-1 model on that triangle , i.e. , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is any vector from a site to the center of any adjoining triangle .",
    "the mapping is many - to - one : the function @xmath64 has period 6 .",
    "notice that the r.h.s . of eq.([eq5 ] ) turns out to be independent of @xmath65 , but the periodic dependence on @xmath66 is phase - shifted by a function @xmath67 which takes different values on each of the three @xmath68 sublattices .",
    "essentially , we have mapped the @xmath69 ensemble of the spin-1 problem into an equivalent interface problem .",
    "note that , given a configuration of @xmath70 , each @xmath52 is specified ( via eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) ) , once for each adjoining triangle .",
    "the requirement that these six values of @xmath52 coincide translates to a somewhat complicated set of contraints between pairs @xmath59 and @xmath71 on adjoining triangles ; the difference @xmath72 may be 0 , @xmath73 , or @xmath74 , but some of these are disallowed ( depending on which @xmath75 values are integer or half - odd - integer , and on the orientation of @xmath76 ) .",
    "the weight of each configuration is given , as in ( [ eq2 ] ) , by by @xmath77 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the @xmath59 mapping explicitly where the spins @xmath52 take values from @xmath78 .",
    "the twelve states are arranged in a circle because the pattern repeats when @xmath79 .",
    "there are certain special `` flat states '' in which @xmath59 is uniform on all triangles .",
    "each of these is periodic with a @xmath80 unit cell  in effect it is a repeat of one of the triangles in fig .",
    "we shall name these states by writing the spins on the three sublattices,``@xmath81 '' and `` @xmath82 '' ; here `` @xmath83 '' stands for @xmath84 .",
    "it should be noted that there are two non - equivalent species of flat state corresponding to integer , and half - integer valued @xmath59 respectively .",
    "they are non - equivalent in the sense that they are not related by _ lattice",
    "_ symmetries .",
    "one of the species that is favored by the _ locking potential _ ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq - vlock ] ) below ) is what is previously called `` ideal '' states@xcite .",
    "thus we can imagine that all states can be described as domains of uniform @xmath59 separated by domain walls .",
    "finally , by coarse - graining @xmath59 over distances large compared to the lattice constant , one obtains @xmath55 which enters the conjectured continuum formula for the free energy , which is entropic in origin@xcite , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the stiffness constant of the fluctuating interface .",
    "a lattice shift by one lattice constant leaves the free energy invariant , but induces global shifts in height space @xmath87 ; hence the potential @xmath88 in ( [ eq6 ] ) must have period one .",
    "it is typically approximated as @xmath89 such a periodic potential , usually referred as the _ locking term_@xcite , favors the heights to take their discrete values one of the two types of flat state , depending on the sign of @xmath90 . for large @xmath0",
    "we expect @xmath91 , favoring the @xmath82 states , in view of the large entropy of flippable spins ; it is not so sure which state is favored at smaller @xmath0 , but this does not matter for the critical exponents ( see sec .  [ scaling ] and  [ operators ] , below .      in the _ rough phase _ , by definition , the locking term is irrelevent , and so the long - wavelength fluctations of height variable @xmath55 are governed by the gaussian term of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) : @xmath92 where we have performed the fourier transform .",
    "hence by equipartition theorem , @xmath93 similarly , we can also measure the _ height - height difference function _ in the real space as : @xmath94 ^ 2\\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{2\\pi k } \\ln(\\pi r / a ) + ... \\;\\ ; ( r \\gg 1 )   \\;\\ ; ,     \\label{eq9 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the lattice spacing cutoff .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , we can compute the scaling dimension @xmath96 of any _ local _ operator @xmath97 , which is defined as in the correlation function , @xmath98 by local operator , we mean that @xmath97 is a local function of spin operators in the vicinity of @xmath99 .",
    "now , the same spin configuration is recovered when the height variable @xmath59 is increased by 6.@xcite thus any local operator @xmath97 is also a periodic function in the height space , and can consequently be expanded as a fourier series : @xmath100 where @xmath101 runs over height - space reciprocal - lattice vectors ( i.e. multiples of @xmath102 ) .",
    "the last step of simplification in ( [ eq11 ] ) follows because the scaling dimension @xmath96 of the operator @xmath97 is determined by the leading relevant operator in the above expansion , i.e. , @xmath103 is the smallest @xmath101 with nonzero coefficient in the sum . inserting eq .",

    "already , the spin operator on a given site has a periodicity of @xmath109 in the height space , from which a simple inspection shows that the bond - energy operator is also periodic in the height space with a periodicity of @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the reciprocal lattice vectors of the most relevant operator in the fourier expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) are @xmath111 for spin and bond - energy operators respectively .    if a magnetic field is implemented by adding a term @xmath112 to the hamiltonian , then our dimensionless uniform `` magnetic field '' is defined by @xmath113 .",
    "the exponents associated with @xmath114 ( and with the uniform magnetic susceptibility ) , are easily related to the correlation exponents of the uniform magnetization operator , @xmath115 where @xmath58 is the center of a triangle formed by sites @xmath56 .",
    "a simple inspection of fig .  [ fig1 ] shows that such an operator has a periodicity of @xmath116 in the height space , thus yielding : @xmath117      observe that the microscopic height variable @xmath50 in any flat state is not uniform but is rapidly modulated with the wave vector @xmath118 .",
    "the amplitude of modulation itself is a periodic function of the _ coarse - grained _ height field @xmath55 which in turn implies that the correlation function decays with distance as a power - law , and consequently that its structure factor has a power - law singularity at @xmath119 .",
    "such a zone - corner singularity is also directly connected to the singularity in the structure factor of the bond - energy operator . to see this , recall that there is a linear relation between the microscopic height variables and the bond - energy operator given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath120 then it is interesting to note that the fourier transform @xmath121 of bond - energy operator given above turns out to be @xmath122 in other words , as a byproduct of measuring @xmath123 , we have at the same time measured the structure factor of , say , the bond - energy operator of the same orientation specified by the nearest - neighbor vector @xmath8 : @xmath124 we will utilize this relation in sec .

    "fluctuations around this height , then , have at most short - range ( exponentially decaying ) correlations . thus we expect them to have a spatial `` white noise '' spectrum : @xmath137 for small @xmath138 .",
    "a phase with `` hidden '' order was suggested by lipowski and horiguchi@xcite .",

    "( b ) ) using the exponents associated with vortices .",
    "the other exponents in kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) theory are associated with elementary defects ( often called vortices ) .",
    "indeed , it is easy to check ( in this system ) that the excess energy of a non - ground - state plaquette is directly proportional to its vortex charge ( a burgers vector in height - space ) , so the effect of nonzero temperature is simply to make the vortex fugacity nonzero .",
    "the vortex exponent is @xmath152 , so as usual the vortex fugacity becomes relevant and defects unbind , destroying the critical state , at the kt transition defined by a spin exponent taking the critical value @xmath153 .",
    "if @xmath154 at zero temperature , i.e. @xmath155 , then defects unbind as soon as @xmath151 .",

    "did not , however , address the critical exponents of the correlation length @xmath158 and the specific heat @xmath159 as a function of temperature , which are also controlled by vortex exponents .",
    "naively , if the energy cost creating one vortex is @xmath160 , and if the minimum excitation is a vortex pair , then one would expect the low - temperature specific heat to behave as @xmath161 and at @xmath30 this is indeed true@xcite .",
    "however , the renormalization group@xcite shows the singular specific heat behaves as @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the vortex fugacity ; consequently when @xmath164 , the true behavior is @xmath165 with @xmath166 .",
