    "a general approach to character recognition via critical points was presented in joint papers of the author with g. nepomnyashchii @xcite,@xcite in 1991 .",
    "these papers present a theoretical background of the critical point approach and inform on the first results obtained in its implementation .",
    "but these papers do not present the concrete code which was realized by programming .",
    "the reason is that this code was a commercial secret in that time .",
    "but now the author has finished his software business and has no more obstacles to open the code to the public .",
    "let us call this code cript - code , this was the name of ocr - programs which was produced under the direction of the author in the years 1990 - 1995 in some small russian software firm named `` scriptum '' .",
    "the following exposition one can consider as a 1-dimensional version of the morse theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is very elementary .",
    "that is why we omit some simple proofs . for practical work one does need proofs , that is the reason to omit a long proofs .",
    "we always suppose that on plane is fixed a system of cartesian coordinates .",
    "the second coordinate will be called height .",
    "the set of all points of the plane which has a fixed height @xmath0 will be called a _ @xmath0-level line _ or _",
    "@xmath0-level_. each @xmath0-level line divides plane into two semiplanes which we will call _ @xmath0-upper _ and _ @xmath0-lower_. if @xmath1 the intersection of @xmath2-lower and @xmath0-upper semiplanes is called horizontal @xmath3$]-band .",
    "the reader can understand the word _",
    "arc _ as a _ broken line without self - intersection _ , although almost all consideration are valid for an arbitrary jordan curve .",
    "_ closed arc _ is an arc without ends and nonclosed one has two ends .",
    "the projection of an arc on the second coordinate is said to be _ height range _ of the arc .",
    "the heights of the ends of an arc will be called _ ends levels_. the arcs which are of interest are connectivity components of intersection of the boundary of some plane domain with a horizontal band .",
    "the ends of such arcs belongs to the boundary of the band .",
    "this motivates the following definition .",
    "an arc will be called",

    ".    we will divide @xmath3$]-bounded arcs into four height s types corresponding to letters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .    the type @xmath5 is associated with the word `` crossing '' .",
    "an arc @xmath8 has the type @xmath5 or that it is a _ crossing _ if the ends of its height s range coincides with its ends levels .    and",
    "we will call an arc @xmath8 as _ @xmath3$]-crossing _ if it is a crossing with the height range @xmath3 $ ] .    the type @xmath4 is associated with the words `` birth '' .",
    "an arc @xmath8 has the type @xmath4 if it is contained in @xmath0-upper semiplane and both its ends have the same height .    the type @xmath6 is associated with the words `` death '' .",
    "an arc @xmath8 has the type @xmath6 if it is contained in the @xmath0-lower semiplane and both its ends have the same height .    and finally an arc is called to have the type @xmath7 if it is an closed arc because closed arcs are @xmath7-like .",
    "let us say that an arc @xmath8 _ touches _ a @xmath0-level if @xmath0 is the end of the height range of @xmath8 and is not its ends level .",
    "in the case @xmath8 is contained in the @xmath0-upper ( upper touching ) or @xmath0-lower ( lower touching ) semiplane .",
    "a number @xmath0 is called a _ critical height _ of an arc @xmath8 and @xmath0-level is called _ @xmath8-critical _ if there is such subarc @xmath9 , that touches @xmath0-level .",

    "for an @xmath11-unicritical @xmath3$]-band and for every crossing component @xmath8 of @xmath13 $ ] one define its _ position _ @xmath30 as the number of crossing components of @xmath13 $ ] which are on the left from @xmath8 .    to define the cript - code of the @xmath13 $ ] let us consider the sequence @xmath31 of crossing components of @xmath13 $ ] ordered by increasing of the position .",
    "for every crossing component @xmath32 let us denote by @xmath33 the type of connectivity component of @xmath13 $ ] to which it belongs .    the sequence @xmath34 is called is called _ @xmath3$]-cript - string _ of the domain @xmath11 .",
    "cript - string which contains the only type @xmath5 is called _",
    "trivial_. the trivial cript - string one obtains if the band is uncritical .",
    "let us say that an increasing sequence of numbers @xmath35 is an _ unicritical decomposition _ of @xmath11 , if @xmath11 is contained in the band @xmath36 $ ] and all bands @xmath37 $ ] are unicritical .    for any unicritical decomposition @xmath35 of @xmath11 let us define @xmath38$]-cript code of @xmath11 as the sequence of @xmath37$]-cript strings separated by @xmath39 .",
    "an unicritical decomposition @xmath35 of @xmath11 with minimal possible @xmath40 is called _ minimal decomposition_. the cript - code of a minimal decomposition of @xmath11 is called _ minimal cript - code _ of @xmath11 .",
    "this code does not depends of the choice of a minimal decomposition and is uniquely defined by the domain .",
    "one can obtain the minimal cript - code using any unicritical decomposition @xmath35 simply eliminating in the @xmath38$]-cript code trivial strings .",
    "the proof of these facts easily follows from the following lemma .",
    "let two bands @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] be both @xmath11-unicritical and contain the same @xmath11-critical level .",
    "in this case @xmath41$]-cript - string and @xmath42$]-cript - string coincide .    proof .",
    "let us consider at first the case @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the band @xmath45 $ ] does not contain @xmath11-critical levels , and by virtue of lemma [ td ] the intersection of @xmath12 with the band consists only of @xmath45$]-crossings . for every end @xmath46 of a connectivity component @xmath8 of @xmath47 $ ] on the level @xmath48 there is unique @xmath45$]-crossing which contains @xmath46 . adding to @xmath8 this crossing one obtains an connectivity component of @xmath49 $ ] , which has the same type . and",
    "it is obvious that such operation conserve the position .",
    "hence @xmath50$]-cript - string coincides with @xmath51$]-cript - string .",
    "if @xmath52 the above arguments prove coincidence of cript - strings for bands @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the coincidence of cript - strings for bands @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] can be proved by the same arguments .",
    "the lemma is proved .",
    "the above lemma justifies the following definition .",
    "let @xmath0 be a critical level for @xmath12 , let us define @xmath0-cript - string of the domain @xmath11 as @xmath45$]-cript - string for some unicritical band @xmath45 $ ] containing @xmath0 .    as easy to see the minimal cript - code of @xmath11 coincides with the sequence of its cript - strings corresponding to all its critical levels taken in the order of decreasing of level .",
    "the cript - code of a domain can be represented as a word of the alphabet @xmath54 .",
    "for example the letters @xmath55 , @xmath4 , @xmath7 has the following cript - codes    ; cc;cddc;cc;dddd ( letter @xmath55 )    ; cc;cddc;cc;cddc;dd ( letter @xmath27 )    ; cc;cddc;dd ( letter @xmath7 ) .    one can prove the following theorem which justifies the application of minimal cript - code for recognition .",
    "two domains has the same minimal cript - code iff there exist such preserving orientation homeomorphism of its interiors which preserves height - levels , i.e. if two points have the same height its images have the same property .",
    "theoretically to produce the cript - code of a digital picture , which has the form of a bit - map it is sufficiently to indicate a way how to associate with it a plane region and then to consider the cript - code of its boundary .",
    "this construction may be performed in the following way : at first one assigns to the bit - map the finite set of points with integral coordinates , the first coordinate is the number of the column of a black pixel ( black corresponds to 1 , and white corresponds to 0 presents the background of the picture ) , the second is the number of its string . at second",
    "one assigns to each such integral point the rectangle which has it as its center of symmetry and has sides parallel to coordinates , such that its height is equal to 1 and its width is equal 1.1 .",
    "now the associated domain can be defined as the union of the rectangles associated with black pixels .",
    "the cript - code of a bit - map is defined as the cript - code of associated domain .    in practice the generation of cript - code",
    "is performed during the first scanning of the bit - map image simultaneously with dividing of the image into connectivity components , which is a necessary operation for any ocr - program .",
    "let us remark that all critical levels of the associated domain has fractional part @xmath56 .",
    "therefore all bands of the type @xmath57 $ ] for a natural @xmath58 are unicritical and one can apply it to calculate the cript - code of the associated domain . to calculate a cript - string corresponding to level @xmath59 one has to consider @xmath58-th and @xmath60-th strings of the bitmap .",
    "the practical algorithm produces from a string of a bit - map the switching sequence which represent the sequence of natural numbers @xmath61 which correspond to positions of switching from white to black and from black to white .",
    "so @xmath62 is the number of position of the first ( from the left ) black pixel , and @xmath63 is the number of position of the last black pixel .",
    "if @xmath61 is the switching sequence of @xmath58-th string and @xmath64 is the switching sequence of the next string we can construct cript - code for this pair , which corresponds to the level @xmath65 .",
    "namely , all pairs of @xmath4-codes of considered band are in one - to - one correspondence with such 4-tuples @xmath66 which satisfy one of the following conditions :    1 .",
    "if @xmath67 is odd then @xmath68 is even and @xmath69 2 .",
    "if @xmath67 is even then @xmath68 is odd and @xmath70    dually , all pairs of @xmath6-codes correspond to 4-tuples @xmath66 which satisfy one of the following conditions :    1 .   if @xmath68 is odd then @xmath67 is even and @xmath71 2 .",
    "if @xmath68 is even then @xmath67 is odd and @xmath72 .",
    "all @xmath5 codes corresponds to such pairs @xmath73 that    1 .",
    "@xmath74 is even and @xmath75 2 .",
    "if @xmath67 is odd then @xmath68 is odd @xmath76 or @xmath77 3 .",
    "if @xmath67 is even then @xmath68 is even @xmath78 or @xmath79",
    "the cript - code of a domain @xmath11 represent a word of the cript - alphabet @xmath80 .",
    "let us say that a word of cript - alphabet is _ correct _ if there is such a domain which has this word as its cript - code .",
    "let us find conditions which characterize the correctness . to do it we have to introduce some definitions .",
    "for any word @xmath81 by @xmath82 $ ] we denote its subword which start with @xmath58-th letter of @xmath81 and terminates at the @xmath83-th letter of it .",
    "so @xmath84 $ ] is the @xmath58-th letter of @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath85 we pose @xmath82 $ ] is the empty word .",
    "let us denote by @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 correspondingly the number of letters @xmath27 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath39 in it .",
    "so @xmath90 is the number of strings in a cript - code . supposing that @xmath91 for empty word one can define the @xmath58-th string of any word @xmath81 as @xmath92 $ ] , where @xmath93)<e(w[1,n-1])=e(w[1,m])<e(w[1,m+1])=k$ ] .",
    "the notation for the @xmath58-th string of @xmath81 is @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "the first obvious condition is that the first string of a correct word contains only letters @xmath27 .",
    "one can write this condition as @xmath95)>0 $ ] , @xmath96)=0 $ ] and @xmath97)=0 $ ] .",
    "the dual condition is that the last string contains only letters @xmath6 .",
    "let us name this conditions _ boundary conditions_.    the second pair of conditions we name _ evenness conditions_. if before a symbol of the code of the type @xmath27 or @xmath6 there are even number of the same symbols then the next symbol of the code has the same type . for the letter @xmath27 the evenness condition one can wright as follows : if @xmath98)-1=b(w[1,n-1])$ ] is an even number then @xmath99)=b(w[1,n])+1 $ ] .",
    "let us say that two symbols of the same type @xmath27 or @xmath6 are conjugated to each other if before the first of them one has even number of the same symbols and the second is the succeeder of the first one .",
    "hence in a correct code all symbols of types @xmath27 and @xmath6 are divided into pairs of conjugated symbols .",
    "geometrically conjugated symbols represent pairs of crossing component of the same connectivity component .    the third type of conditions we will name _ balance conditions_. let @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 denotes such levels that the bands @xmath103 $ ] and @xmath104 $ ] are @xmath11-unicritical and its cript - strings represent @xmath58-th and @xmath60-th strings of the cript - code @xmath81 of @xmath11 .    the number of component of intersection of @xmath12 with the level @xmath0 from one side is equal to @xmath105)+c(w[k])$ ] because the last number is the number of ends of crossing component of @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "and from the other side it is equal to @xmath107)+c(w[k+1])$ ] because this number is equal to the number of ends of crossing components of @xmath108 $ ] . as result one obtains for every @xmath58 the following _ balance equality _ :",
    "@xmath109)+c(w[k])=d(w[k+1])+c(w[k+1])\\ ] ]        let @xmath111 and @xmath81 are two one - string words ( @xmath112 ) which satisfy the balance equality @xmath113 . for such strings we introduce the following _ contactness _ relation .",
    "we will say that a letter of @xmath111 on @xmath58-th position contacts with a letter of @xmath81 on the @xmath83-th position if the type of the first letter is @xmath27 or @xmath5 , the type of the second letter is @xmath5 or @xmath6 and @xmath114)+c(v[1,k-1])=c(w[1,n-1])+d(w[1,n-1])$ ] .",
    "the geometrical meaning of the contactness was demonstrated by the lemma [ sum ]",
    ". the contacting codes for cript - strings of adjancent unicritical bands corresponds to intersecting crossing components .          to construct the domain which has the given word @xmath81 as its cript - code",
    "let us chose an increasing sequence @xmath115 , where @xmath116 . on every @xmath117-level",
    "let us choose the sequence @xmath118 of points where @xmath119 is the number of letters in @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "suppose that these points are ordered by the increasing of the first coordinate .",
    "now let us join by right segments all pairs of points corresponding to conjugated codes and join all pairs of contacted points .",
    "we omit the proof that the constructed domain has the cript - code equal to @xmath81 .    from the above considerations one can get an algorithm of extracting of cript - codes of connectivity components from the cript - code of an disconnected domain .",
    "indeed , two letters of the cript - code of the domain belongs to the same connectivity component iff there is a sequence of letters of the code such that the first term of the sequence coincide with the first given letter , the last one coincide with the second given letter and for any letter of the sequence its succeeder is or conjugated or contacted to it .      and another practical problem is elimination of distortions . to do it",
    "one can clusterize the critical levels and separate clusters to generate the cript - code . in this case one",
    "has to work with cript - strings of bands which are not unicritical .",
    "for this bands can arise arcs of type @xmath7 .",
    "one can encounter a difficulties to order crossing components in the case because some crossing component can have disjoint height ranges .",
