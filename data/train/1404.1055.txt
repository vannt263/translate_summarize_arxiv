    "the characteristics of living creatures , as well known , can be linked to their dna properties . in a similar fashion",
    "we may ask if , given the features of a globular cluster system ( gcs ) ( defined in terms of spatial distribution , chemical composition and ages ) , they can yield `` genetic '' information about the field stellar populations of the early - type galaxies ( etgs ) they belong to . this question can be extended to late - type galaxies regarding the formation of their stellar halos and bulges .    a number of papers in the literature have pointed out differences between field stars and globular clusters ( gcs ) rather than similarities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although such differences should take into account that gcs properties come in _ number weighted _ form , contrasting with those of galaxy properties , that we read in a _ luminosity weighted _",
    "way , the generalized conclusion seems to indicate that gcs and field stars have followed different formation histories .    in the meantime",
    ", the discovery of multi - stellar populations in gcs suggests processes where the gc formation was _",
    "`` a for more titanic event than ever imagined before '' _ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these scenarios involve large amounts of field stars per gc that would share some characteristics of the clusters @xcite .    despite some difficulties ( e.g. the required high star formation efficiencies ; see @xcite ) , these models seem consistent with the idea that gcs could be tracers of much more massive diffuse stellar populations .",
    "this kind of approach was explored in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , ffg05 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ffg07 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fvf09 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fvf12 ) .    in a recent paper , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hha13 in what follows ) , present an extensive compilation of several structural parameters that characterize gcs and their parent galaxies .",
    "these authors also discuss the implications of a number of correlations that arise considering gcs as a whole , i.e. not including the effects of gcs sub - populations .",
    "one of their conclusions indicates that the total number of gcs is not a good estimator of the total stellar mass of a galaxy .",
    "in fact , a linear _ log - log _ fit between these quantities shows deviations both at the low and high galaxy mass regimes .",
    "they also show that , in a gc population so defined , there is a clear trend between the mass fraction locked in gcs , @xmath0 , and the total stellar galaxy mass that adopts a _ u - shaped _ form , already noted by @xcite , in terms of the _ gc specific frequency _ @xmath1 ( number of gcs per v - luminosity in @xmath2 units ) .",
    "hha13 interpret that this shape is the consequence of a decrease of the star formation efficiency , both at the low and high mass regimes produced by mass loss and by the energetic events connected with the nuclei of galaxies , respectively .",
    "in this paper we attempt to elaborate further on those results by introducing the effect of gc bi - modality , i.e. , the presence of _ blue _ and _ red _ gcs .",
    "in particular , we aim at exploring the usefulness of these distinct gc populations to trace large scale features of galaxies as , total stellar mass , the relative contribution of halos and bulges to that mass , chemical abundances , stellar mass to luminosity ratios and , indirectly , dark matter content .",
    "a preliminary attempt to link galaxies with their gcs in terms of the blue and red populations , was presented in fvf09 for galaxies observed within the acs virgo cluster survey of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we revise that approach taking advantage of later developments , namely , the accessibility to the original photometry of gcs in the acs virgo galaxies @xcite , the multicolour photometry of these galaxies @xcite , and the c - griz colour - metallicity grid from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , f13 ) .    as in previous works",
    ", we stand on the idea that gc formation is not a singular event but , rather , is associated with large volumes of star formation that eventually lead to the origin of distinct populations : a low metallicity and spatially extended stellar halo , associated with the blue globulars , and a more concentrated and chemically more heterogeneous stellar population , connected with the red gcs .",
    "the presence of extended low - metallicity halos has been noticed by different means , for example , in ngc3379 @xcite and ngc4472 @xcite .",
    "this work assumes that the gcs colour bi - modality is the consequence of the genuine bimodal nature of their chemical composition distributions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , not an artifact of some eventually non - linear integrated colour - metallicity relations . on the other side , and as noted in f13 , this last kind of relations does not reject necessarily the possibility of a genuine chemical bi - modality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the definition of _ fiducial _ galaxies is given in section[fiducials ] .",
    "the analysis of the gcs colour distributions , as well as their modelling in terms of chemical abundance , are described in section[color ] .",
    "the link between gcs and the diffuse stellar populations of the galaxies is presented in section[field ] , while the photometric scales for globular clusters and galaxies are discussed in section[zeropoints ] .",
    "the model results based on galaxy colours and integrated brightness are discussed in section[colours ] .",
    "the analysis of the shape of the relation between total number of gcs and galaxy masses is presented in section[break ] .",
    "the connection between the srsic parameter and the projected stellar surface mass density for the fiducial galaxies is presented in section[sersic ] .",
    "the results of modelling the low - metallicity stellar halo , bulge - like component , and total stellar masses , as well as the gc _ formation efficiency _ are presented in section[halobulge ] .",

    "the case of the fornax spheroidal galaxy is described in section[fornax ] , and the final conclusions are given in section[conclu ] .",
    "one of the problems in looking for a gc - field stars connection is the noise inherent to the counting statistics of gcs , an effect that becomes more severe as the galaxy is fainter and the number of associated gcs is lower . in order to decrease this effect",
    "we `` merge '' both the stellar and gcs populations of virgo acs galaxies creating _ fiducial _ galaxies . for this purpose",
    ", we compose the @xmath3 and @xmath4 brightness ( through the observed flux in each band ) in order to derive the integrated magnitudes and @xmath5 colours of each fiducial galaxy .",
    "this approach would work only if there is a pattern , common to all galaxies , linking the features of field stars and their gcs .",
    "the idea also assumes that the bulk of field stars and gcs are mostly coeval or spread over a limited range of ages .",
    "this seems to be true , at least for galaxies of the `` red sequence '' ( or see @xcite , for the particular case of ngc3923 ) .",
    "the fiducial systems contain a given number of galaxies , ordered by decreasing brightness in the @xmath3 band , and were defined trying to fulfill two conditions .",
    "on one side , they should have a sufficiently large number of gcs to allow a proper fit of their composite colour histograms and , on the other , a significant separation in terms of the mean absolute magnitudes of consecutive fiducial galaxies ( at least @xmath6 mag ) .    in this work",
    "we adopt the ugriz galaxy photometry extensively discussed by @xcite although we restrict our analysis only to the @xmath5 colour index . in the case of the gcs",
    "we use the photometric @xmath3 and @xmath5 data presented by @xcite , after taking into account completeness and field contamination ( see below ) .    throughout the work we use the magnitude relations :    @xmath7    @xmath8    derived from @xcite , where the absolute magnitudes @xmath9 were obtained for each galaxy through the distance moduli given in @xcite and the @xmath10 colours from @xcite .    from the whole virgo acs galaxy sample ( 100 galaxies )",
    ", we remove galaxies without distance moduli in @xcite as well as particular subgroups as the `` blue cloud '' or `` red compact '' dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we also rejected galaxies in frames contaminated by the gcs of massive neighbours and those that , after removing field contamination , leads to a null content of gcs .",
    "this procedure leaves a total sample of 67 galaxies .",
    "an estimate of field contamination was carried out by selecting twelve galaxies with less than ten globulars and considering as possible field interlopers all those objects with galactocentric distances larger than 30 arcsecs .",
    "this statistic , scaled by field size and number of galaxies composing a given fiducial galaxy , was subtracted from the composite gc @xmath5 colour histograms .",
    "regarding the limiting magnitude that assures an acceptable degree of completeness , we compared the number of gcs bluer and redder than @xmath11 , in 0.5 mag intervals in the @xmath3 band .",
    "the ratio between these numbers for the whole gc sample in @xcite , shows a detectable deficit of blue globulars for objects fainter than @xmath12 mag , a brightness that we adopt as the limit of our statistic . under the assumption that gcs",
    "have fully gaussian integrated luminosity functions , with a mean value @xmath13 , that limit leaves out some 15 percent of the total cluster population .    finally , we are left with a total of 5470 gcs in 67 galaxies that define nine fiducial galaxies .",
    "the first fiducials , due to their brightness and well populated gcs , contain 5 , 3 and 5 galaxies , respectively .",
    "in particular , the two first composite galaxies appear above the magnitude gap at @xmath14 detectable in the colour magnitude diagram ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in",
    "what follows , the interstellar reddening corrections were derived by adopting @xmath152.15  @xmath16 and the colour excesses listed by @xcite which , in turn , are based on the @xcite maps .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath9 versus intrinsic colour @xmath17 relation for the galaxy sample , corresponding to a mean colour excess @xmath18 and mean interstellar extinction @xmath19 , is shown in figure[mg_gz1 ] , where the straight line has the same slope of the fit presented by @xcite in their study of the colour - magnitude relation of the acs virgo cluster galaxies .",

    "all of them exhibit a more or less evident minimum at this last mass .",
    "@xcite identify this minimum as a `` pivot mass '' that changes with redshift but keeps a constant dark to stellar mass ratio @xmath41 .    in particular , and in a cautious way",
    ", we adopt the results from @xcite for the following discussion .",
    "the galaxy stellar masses derived by these authors and ours follow a linear relation :    @xmath42    and their galaxy masses ( and dark mass to stellar mass ratios ) were transformed to the galaxy mass scale of this paper in what follows .",
    "that choice is motivated by two arguments .",
    "first , figure[halo_dm_mt ] shows a remarkable similarity between the dark to stellar mass ratios from these authors ( scaled down by -2.07 in the logarithmic ordinate ) , and the ratio between the mass of the low - metallicity halos to total stellar mass from table[table_4 ] .",
    "moreover , recent studies of the giant elliptical galaxy ngc5846 , presented by @xcite , and for ngc4486 by @xcite , give a range of values of the dark halo to stellar mass ratios that are in excellent agreement with the @xcite ratios .",
    "second , this is consistent with previous results based on the similarity of the spatial distributions of the blue gcs and low - metallicity halos and that of dark matter in ngc1399 and ngc4486 ( ffg05 and fvf12 , respectively ) .",
    "the shift of the @xcite relation in fig .",
    "[ halo_dm_mt ] , corresponds to stellar masses of @xmath43 of the dark halo mass .",
    "this is comparable to the ratio derived for ngc4486 , by combining the mass of the low - metallicity halo given in fvf12 ( @xmath44 ) , and the total enclosed mass within about 100 kpc from @xcite and @xcite ( @xmath45 ) , that yield a ratio @xmath46 .",
    "although these coincidences are encouraging for further analysis , we also note the discrepancy , pointed out by @xcite , between different estimates of the dark halo mass in ngc4486 .",
    "eventually , the adoption of the @xcite relation , and our galaxy stellar masses , can be used to obtain the dark mass content for each fiducial galaxy , and for the definitions of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , i.e. , the ratios between the number of total , blue and red gcs to dark matter mass .",
    "figure[all_t_dark ] shows the behaviour of @xmath47 as a function of the dark halo mass and the contribution of each gc sub - population to this quantity .",
    "blue and red clusters show opposite trends in the dark mass range from @xmath50 to 12.0 ( i.e. , galaxies fainter than the `` gap '' in the colour - magnitude diagram of figure[halo_dm_mt ] ) , that once combined , lead to a rather constant @xmath47 in that mass domain .",
    "figure[tb_tb_dark_dm ] compares the number of blue gcs per low - metallicity halo mass and per dark matter mass .",
    "these two parameters show similar trends ( as expected if the low - metallicity halo and dark mass halo keep a constant ratio , as shown in figure[halo_dm_mt ] ) .",
    "the minimum values in both @xmath31 and @xmath51 occur at the fourth fiducial galaxy , where the surface stellar density @xmath23 reaches a maximum .",
    "this trend contrasts with the counterpart corresponding to the red gcs , shown in figure[tr_tr_dark_dm ] . in this case",
    ", the number of gcs per dark mass units increases along with the mass of the dark halo , showing an inflection at @xmath52 .",
    "instead , the @xmath32 parameter shows a minimum at a value coincident with the mass of the galaxies where the surface stellar density @xmath23 reaches a maximum .    for dark halo masses larger than @xmath53 , both @xmath32 and @xmath49 rise in similar ways , although this is a consequence of our adopted approach regarding the distribution of blue and red gcs in the extended halos of the three most massive fiducial galaxies .",
    "figure[gamma_tdark ] , shows that the @xmath54 parameter listed in table[table_4 ] , scales very well with @xmath47 ( through a shift of @xmath55 in the logarithmic ordinate ) .",
    "this connection suggests that , the proportionality coefficient @xmath54 may be an indication of the number of eventual gc formation sites ( dark mini - halos ) which will be occupied by blue or red gcs , depending on the availability of baryonic matter and its density ( in turn associated with chemical abundance ) .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite have a completely different view of the situation in the frame of milgromian mechanics .",
    "these authors argue that the @xmath1 parameter has two , and opposite , dependencies upon the apparent virial mass ( including a `` phantom '' , i.e. , non - existent dark halo ) that , combined , leads to the _ u - shaped _ relation with the stellar mass of the galaxy .                    , shifted by -0.65 ( open circles ) , and @xmath56 parameters ( filled circles ) as a function of dark halo mass for each fiducial galaxy . ]",
    "the fornax spheroidal galaxy is @xmath57 times less massive than our lowest mass fiducial galaxy and has five gcs .",
    "@xcite detect the presence of several stellar populations ( ancient , intermediate and young ) with a strongly assymetric metallicity distribution of the field stars , that peaks at @xmath58\\approx-1.0 $ ] , and has an extended tail that reaches @xmath58\\approx-2.5 $ ] .",
    "@xcite emphasize that this distribution is clearly different , and seemingly could not be reconciled with that of the gcs .",
    "four of these clusters have @xmath58 $ ] in the range from -2.1 to -2.5 , while the remaining one ( fornax4 ) , has a higher metallicity , @xmath58=-1.4 $ ] .",
    "establishing a connection of gcs with field stars is clearly difficult on the basis of a few clusters and is certainly affected by stochastic effects . besides , the star formation history of the fornax dwarf seems rather complex ( see , for example , @xcite ) . with these caveats in mind",
    ", we attempted the same approach used in this paper .",
    "we start with a blue gc population characterized by a parameter @xmath59 , similar to those in the lowest mass fiducial galaxy , and change both the number ratio of blue to red gcs , as well as the @xmath28 and @xmath60 parameters , aiming at reproducing the observed chemical abundance distribution of the field stars .",
    "this is accomplished by adopting @xmath61 , a number ratio of blue to red gcs of 4 , and @xmath62 , i.e. , about twice the value that gives a proper fit to the more massive fiducial galaxies .",
    "we have no information about the behavior of the @xmath60 parameter for galaxies with masses below @xmath63 but an increase with decreasing galaxy mass , and stellar density , can not be dismissed .    the chemical abundance - stellar mass spectrum delivered by the model",
    "is depicted in figure [ fornax ] and shows a very good qualitative agreement with the distribution for stars displayed in figure1 of @xcite .",
    "this comparison assumes that the stellar mass contained in each chemical abundance bin scales directly with the number of stars in the same bin .",
    "note that in the case of the fornax galaxy we expect the presence of a single red gc , that possibly did not form or that eventually could be identified with fornax4 .",
    "this paper revisits the connection between gcs and the stellar populations of 67 galaxies included in the acs virgo cluster survey @xcite .",
    "the main results are :    1 .",
    "the definition of composite _ fiducial _ galaxies was useful in clarifying the quantitative connection bteween gcs and the stellar populations of the galaxies they belong to .",
    "these fiducial galaxies are just a representation of average properties that arise as a result of different `` nature - nurture '' events that take place along the life of a galaxy .",
    "the possibility of reproducing the integrated colours of galaxies through the analysis of their gcs , and with a constant parameter @xmath60 ( equation[eqn5 ] ) , strongly suggests the existence of a common mechanism that regulates the link between clusters and field stars .",
    "the value of that parameter indicates higher gc formation efficiency as metallicity decreases . this dependence may be indicating a background process connected with enviromental conditions ( through a metallicity - stellar density link ) as noted in section[halobulge ] .",
    "+ we stress that the proposed gcs - field stars link also gives a proper representation of the chemical distribution of field stars for low - mass galaxies ( e.g. the fornax dwarf spheroidal ) although it requires higher @xmath60 values , something we can not justify yet on observational basis .",
    "the separation of gcs in two families , according to their respective chemical scale lengths @xmath64 , shows that blue and red clusters increase their number with total stellar galaxy mass but with distinct behaviours . once combined as a `` single population '' , the @xmath65 versus @xmath66 relation found for the virgo acs galaxies ,",
    "is consistent with the non - linear trend ( in a _ log - log _ plane ) pointed out by hha13 .",
    "the mean total stellar mass of the fiducial galaxies follows a linear relation with the _ dynamical mass _ , given in terms of the stellar dispersion and effective radius presented by @xcite and correlated with @xmath67 in hha13 .",
    "the empirical approach proposed to connect gcs and field stars allows an estimate of the low - metallicity halo and bulge - like stellar masses .",
    "in particular , these last structures arise in galaxies with stellar masses larger than @xmath68 and grow up rapidly for more massive galaxies .",
    "+ in this sense , they appear to be more `` pseudo - bulges '' ( originated in the ability of the galaxies to retain their chemical outputs ) than bulges that grow as a consequence of environmental effects .",
    "+ we also emphasize that bi - modality is a very solid feature since `` dry merging '' of any of the bimodal fiducial galaxies ends up as a new , but also bimodal , gcs colour distribution , although with different @xmath69 and @xmath28 parameters .",
    "+ 5 .   the behaviour of the number of the blue or red gcs per stellar mass units of the populations they are respectively associated ( halo or bulge - like ) as a function of total stellar mass , exhibits a similarity and a difference . on one side , they are both _",
    "u - shaped _ and reach minimum values in the mass range defined by the fiducial galaxies 4 and 5 .",
    "on the other , the red gcs show a marked ( inverse ) dependence with surface stellar mass density .",
    "this dependence is not detectable for the blue gcs as the total stellar mass is dominated by bulge like stars .",
    "the ratio of the low - metallicity stellar halo mass to total stellar mass exhibits a strong similarity ( once properly normalized ) with the ratio of total dark matter mass to stellar mass as presented in @xcite . in some way",
    ", the low - metallicity halo seems a kind of `` subtle echo '' of the dark matter content if the dark to stellar mass ratios given by @xcite are adopted .",
    "it is intriguing that the increase of the @xmath54 and @xmath47 trends with galaxy mass , occurs approximately at the so called _ critical mass _ as defined by @xcite ; the mass value that suggests a `` dichotomy '' in the galaxy formation process as argued by @xcite ; the `` pivot '' mass defined by @xcite ; and , as pointed out in this paper , the stellar mass where the projected stellar surface density @xmath23 reaches a maximum value .",
    "the reason for that increase is not clear although the dramatic change of the effective radii of these galaxies with brightness ( and stellar mass ) , leading to low stellar densities , suggests that this kind of environments may favour the gcs formation efficiency ( speculatively , through better survavility conditions for the cooling flows where gcs would form ) .",
    "in fact , the hierarchical models by @xcite indicate that the most massive galaxies , exhibit less in - situ star formation , have less concentrated halos , and also lower central densities .",
    "these authors also show that the size of these galaxies , and a large fraction of their masses , are the result of the accretion of objects formed `` far '' from the central regions of the galaxies .    in our approach ,",
    "the @xmath64 scale lengths are a measurement of the spread of the metallicity of the blue gc / low - metallicity halo and of the red gc / bulge stars .",
    "the distinction between these `` two '' components is in fact a `` working definition '' in the sense that they provide a good match to the integrated galaxy colours . even though the low - metallicity component is rather homogeneous and",
    "would be properly identified as a `` single population '' , this is not the case of the bulge - like component which , according to their larger @xmath64 scales , suggests a rather inhomogeneous mix of stars with very different chemical abundances .",
    "@xcite already suggested that gcs bimodality may be the result of a `` two phases '' process .",
    "the meaning of `` phase '' , however , seems still an open issue in the context of some recent results .",
    "for example , several works point out that re - ionization has played a role ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in the formation of the metal poor blue gcs that would appear at high redshifts and before the red ( and more heterogeneous chemically ) gcs .",
    "@xcite ( and also see @xcite ) gives arguments to support the existence of a discrete temporal sequence in the frame of hierarchical models , indicating that blue gcs form at a redshift of @xmath22 and are later accreted by galaxies that already have their own metal rich gcs ( formed in - situ ) at redshifts of @xmath70 .",
    "this is similar to the scenario presented by @xcite for the particular case of ngc4486 and later generalized by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also concludes that red gcs only form in galaxies with stellar masses larger than @xmath71 , in approximate agreement with the results presented in this paper regarding to these clusters and their associated bulge - like structures .",
    "in contrast with that landscape , and as noted by @xcite ( and also see @xcite ) the results for the milky way gcs , rather than discrete events , shows a continuous and bifurcated age sequence .",
    "these results indicate that both metal poor and metal rich gcs seem coeval and display the same range of ages ( @xmath70 gy ) , although shifted in metallicity by @xmath72 dex . in their view , blue gcs may need not to have formed in a truncated epoch and as separated episodes . a 2 gy difference between the low ( ngc6397 ) and the high metallicity ( 47tuc ) milky way gcs ,",
    "is also found by @xcite on the basis of the study of the white dwarf sequences in these clusters .    in our analysis , we find that the chemical scale lengths of the blue gcs , @xmath73 , slowly increase with total galaxy mass , i.e. , at least a fraction of them have a link with these galaxies . in a tentative explanation , and coincident with @xcite , we suggest that blue gcs may be a mix of clusters formed in - situ ( and showing a dependence with galaxy mass ) and other accreted , more stochastically , from less massive fragments / galaxies .",
    "if a bifurcated age sequence as in the milky way exists , the chemical abundances of both the blue and red gcs are genuine `` in phase '' clocks .",
    "this would indicate that the term `` phase '' ( in the context of @xcite ) is more a feature connected with environment than with time .    to the question posed by hha13 regarding _ `` what determines the size of a gc population ? '' _ , this paper suggests that it is a competing mechanism where the number of gcs depends on the availability of potential formation sites , that increases with galaxy mass and , at the same time , has an inverse dependence with stellar density .    as a final conclusion",
    ", we find support for the idea that gcs in fact codify information about the large scale features of etgs .",
    "however , the complete code is not yet conclusively understood .",
