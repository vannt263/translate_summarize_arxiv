    "in @xcite a new approach was proposed for finding the low - energy eigenstates of very large or infinite - dimensional quantum hamiltonians .",
    "this proposal combines both diagonalization and monte carlo methods , each being used to solve a portion of the problem for which the technique is most efficient .",
    "the first part of the proposal is to diagonalize the hamiltonian restricted to a subspace containing the most important basis vectors for each low energy eigenstate .",
    "this may be accomplished either through variational techniques or an _ ab initio _ method such as quasi - sparse eigenvector ( qse ) diagonalization .",
    "the second step is to include the contribution of the remaining basis vectors  by monte carlo sampling .",
    "the use of diagonalization allows one to consider systems with fermion sign oscillations and extract information about wavefunctions and excited states .",
    "the use of monte carlo provides tools to handle the exponential increase in the number of basis states for large volume systems .",
    "the first half of this proposal was discussed in @xcite .  an adaptive diagonalization algorithm known as the quasi - sparse eigenvector method",
    "was introduced to find the most important basis vectors for each low energy eigenstate .",
    "this technique is especially valuable when little is known about the low energy states .",
    "it is also the only method available which can handle non - orthogonal bases , non - hermitian hamiltonians , infinite dimensional systems , and which can find several low energy states with like quantum numbers simultaneously .  in this paper",
    "we discuss the second half of the diagonalization / monte carlo scheme .",
    "we introduce several new monte carlo techniques which we call stochastic error correction ( sec ) .",
    "there are two general varieties of stochastic error correction , methods based on a series expansion and those which are not .",
    "the series method starts with an eigenvector of the hamiltonian restricted to some starting subspace and then includes the contribution of the remaining basis states as terms in an ordered expansion .",
    "the idea is to form a perturbative expansion centered around a good non - perturbative starting point .    as an example of a non - series method we discuss a technique called the stochastic lanczos method .",
    "this method again starts with eigenvectors of a hamiltonian submatrix .  using these as starting vectors",
    ", we define krylov vectors , @xmath0 , similar to standard lanczos diagonalization .",
    "the new ingredient is that matrix elements between krylov vectors , @xmath1 are computed using matrix diffusion monte carlo .",
    "since the method does not rely on a series expansion , it has the advantage that the starting vectors need not be close to the exact eigenvectors .    one can generate a large class of stochastic error correction methods based on other non - series algorithms , various ways of resumming the series expansion , or combinations of the two techniques .  in this introductory paper we concentrate on describing the basic principles and implementation of the series and non - series approaches .",
    "we also present three test problems which demonstrate the potential of the new approach for a range of different problems .  in the first example we determine the low energy spectrum of @xmath2 theory using qse diagonalization and first order corrections using the series method .  in the second example we find the low energy spectrum of compact @xmath3 in @xmath4 dimensions using the stochastic lanczos method .  in the last example we find the ground state of the @xmath4 dimensional hubbard model using qse diagonalization and first order series stochastic error correction .  in each case",
    "we compare with published results in the literature .",
    "we conclude with a summary and some general comments on the new computational scheme .",

    "let @xmath34 be the full hilbert space for our system .  as in the previous section",
    "let @xmath7 be the subspace over which we have diagonalized @xmath6 exactly .",
    "let @xmath35 be the projection operator for @xmath7 and let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath6 restricted to @xmath7 so that @xmath38  let @xmath39 be an auxiliary subspace , one which contains @xmath7 but excludes very high - energy states .",

    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a review of methods in diffusion monte carlo .",
    "we end the section with a discussion of the fermion sign problem .",
    "the sign problem is a general issue for any monte carlo calculation .  for a system with sign oscillations",
    "the evaluation of a euclidean - time green s function involves sums @xmath67 with the property that @xmath68 where @xmath34 is the volume , @xmath69 is the euclidean time , and @xmath70 is a positive constant",
    ".  we will refer to this term as the cancellation ratio .",
    "the exponential dependence on @xmath34 and @xmath69 makes computations difficult even for small systems .",
    "the sign problem will affect the calculation of @xmath60 in the stochastic lanczos algorithm and terms in the series method discussed in the previous section .",
    "the effect however is different from the sign problem in typical monte carlo green s function calculations .",
    "stochastic error correction is a calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors rather than a sampling of the partition function or the time evolution of a given initial state .",
    "therefore the quantity of interest is not @xmath71 but the action of @xmath6 or @xmath72 on approximate eigenvectors of @xmath6 .",
    "due to homogeneity in @xmath6 the explicit volume dependence does not appear in the cancellation ratio .",
    "instead we find @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a positive constant .",
    "the sign problem will return if the starting point of the sec calculation is very poor and it becomes necessary to use @xmath62 such that @xmath75 is large .",
    "however in many cases @xmath75 can be kept small even for large @xmath62 since the most important part of the hamiltonian , @xmath76 is diagonalized exactly .  in short",
    "the sign problem is less severe because stochastic error correction uses the result of subspace diagonalization as its starting point .",
    "the first example we consider is @xmath77 theory in @xmath4 dimensions near the @xmath78 symmetry restoration phase transition .",
    "we will use qse diagonalization and the series version of stochastic error correction to probe the low energy spectrum of the theory on both sides of the phase transition .",
    "in @xcite magruder demonstrated the existence of a phase transition in @xmath2 by extending chang s duality argument for @xmath79 .",
    "the statement of the main result is as follows .",

    "we obtain a duality constraint between the two theories .",
    "one feature of this constraint is that the @xmath89 limit of @xmath88 is mapped to the @xmath90 limit of @xmath82 .",

    "the @xmath88 phase transition was studied using quasi - sparse eigenvector diagonalization with stochastic error correction .",

    "the stochastic lanczos method starts with eigenvectors of a hamiltonian submatrix and constructs matrix elements of krylov vectors using matrix diffusion monte carlo .",
    "this method has the advantage that the starting vectors need not be close to exact eigenvectors .",
    "we presented three different examples which demonstrate the potential of the new approach for strongly coupled scalar , gauge , and fermionic theories .",
    "in the first example we calculated the low energy spectrum of @xmath2 using the series method , and in the second example we found the spectrum of compact @xmath3 in @xmath4 dimensions using the stochastic lanczos method .  in both examples we found agreement with results from the literature .",
    "we also found that unlike typical monte carlo results , the sec method is able to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for excited states with the same quantum numbers as lower lying states .",
    "this advantage is due to its design as a monte carlo improvement of a diagonalization scheme .  in the last example we found the ground state of the @xmath4 dimensional hubbard model using qse diagonalization and first order series stochastic error correction .  in this calculation",
    "we encountered no fermion sign problem and found that our methods yielded very accurate results with far less effort than existing techniques .",
    "we believe that the methods we have presented hold considerable potential for studying a wide range of non - perturbative quantum systems and answering questions difficult to address using other methods ."
