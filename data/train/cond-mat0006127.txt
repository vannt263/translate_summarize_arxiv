    "the influence of defects on the critical behaviour close to a structural phase transition has been studied both experimentally and theoretically for a long time .",

    "the critical exponents near the phase transition temperature can change their values @xcite .",
    "in addition a smearing out of the specific heat can be observed @xcite .",
    "furthermore the central peak , experimentally observed at @xmath7 in the dynamical structure factor above the transition temperature , e.g.  in srtio@xmath0 @xcite , can be explained as a consequence of defects @xcite . in recent years",
    "it has been found that the critical fluctuations above @xmath8 reveal a second length scale in srtio@xmath0 as well as in many others systems @xcite , a feature which has been reviewed by r.  cowley @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was observed in surface - near regions ( typically @xmath9@xmath10 m ) @xcite and the origin of the second length scale is considered to be the existence of defects @xcite .",
    "+ in the present paper , we concentrate on the bulk behaviour where no sharp component occurs , also the central peak is not subject of our investigations , the behaviour of the sharp component will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( paper  ii ) @xcite .",

    "+ the critical scattering above the antiferrodistortive transition of srtio@xmath0 has been studied for samples with different oxygen vacancy concentrations .",
    "we measured the order parameter and the critical exponents of the correlation length and the susceptibility , the oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples was determined independently .",
    "the experimental findings from the scattering experiments are discussed quantitatively in terms of the influence of defects . in the theoretical discussion the static critical behaviour at structural phase transitions is considered with a ginzburg - landau functional , taking into account the influence of defects through a local increase of the critical temperature near the defects .",
    "the use of the replica trick makes it possible to investigate the static critical behaviour with the help of the renormalization - group theory @xcite .",

    "the behaviour of the sharp component in these samples will be discussed in paper  ii @xcite , in the following we only concentrate on the bulk properties .",
    "+ the mosaicity of the verneuil - grown crystals varied between 30  and 100  which is rather broad compared to the almost perfect float - zone grown ( 1-7  ) and flux - grown samples ( 10  )",

    "impedance measurements with microelectrodes of different diameters @xcite revealed a spatially homogeneous conductivity in the samples i and ii . owing to the relation between conductivity and oxygen vacancy concentration @xcite it can be concluded that the concentration of the oxygen vacancies is distributed homogeneously over the respective samples . assuming a random distribution of these vacancies the mean distance of defects results to @xmath23 with @xmath24 the defect concentration .",

    "the values of the critical temperatures , which have been found for the different samples , are given in table [ tab : samples ] .",

    "a crossover between different values for the critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 obtained from @xmath34 and @xmath33 can be identified [ see fig.[fig : broad ] ] .",
    "these data have been taken in the bulk of the float - zone grown sample but the probed volume also included two surfaces ( the front and the back side ) . however , due to the relatively large thickness ( 12 mm ) of the sample , the contribution of the sharp component to the signal , originating from a thin layer at the surface , was less than @xmath35 close to @xmath8 and has been neglected .",
    "+ around @xmath36 a change of slope is clearly visible for both @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "above this crossover temperature the system can be described within mean - field theory , which leads to exponents @xmath40 and @xmath41 , but below the crossover temperature the fitted exponents @xmath42 and @xmath43 are much higher than theoretical values .",
    "the non - classical exponents expected for this 3d - heisenberg system with cubic symmetry , calculated by leguillou et al.@xcite , are @xmath44 and @xmath45 . + in figure [ fig : all_broad ] the inverse correlation length for the four other samples is plotted against the reduced temperature .",
    "effective exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 have been derived by fits of power laws to each data set without taking into account the crossover scenario , because the expected crossover temperature @xmath38 is either too small ( @xmath46 ) or too large ( @xmath47 ) to allow an observation of the crossover within the experimental probed temperature range .",

    "it should be emphasized that the scaling relation @xmath52 , with @xmath53 @xcite , still holds !",
    "also , the scaling relation @xmath54 , which yields @xmath55 for the float - zone grown sample , is in excellent agreement with the experimental data below @xmath8 .",
    "+ in the following discussion an attempt is made to understand the microscopic nature of these experimental results .",
    "in our experimental measurements we found a smearing - out of the squared order parameter near the phase transition , which can be explained theoretically by the presence of local order parameter clusters above @xmath8 @xcite . defects , which locally increase the transition temperature , lead to order parameter clusters above the critical temperature of the homogeneous system . for srtio@xmath0",
    "we expect a rotation of the oxygen octahedra near the position of oxygen vacancies to be responsible for finite order parameter clusters above @xmath8@xcite .",
    "these rotations can occur around one of the three principal directions .",
    "thus a three dimensional heisenberg model should be used to model the critical behaviour . in fig.[fig : tc ] the solid line shows the fit to the experimental data using the power law for the normalized integrated intensity versus the reduced temperature i@xmath56 . because @xmath57 is proportional to the order parameter ,",
    "the value for the critical exponent @xmath58 is in good agreement with the values obtained for the three dimensional heisenberg model in the homogeneous case @xcite .",
    "but , in clear difference to the critical behaviour of homogeneous systems is the fact that for higher concentrations of oxygen vacancies a more pronounced tail exists [ see fig.[fig : tc ] and table [ tab : samples ] ] .",
    "of course the critical fluctuations also contribute to the strength of these tails .",
    "however , the contribution of the existing order parameter clusters and the dependence of the defect concentration is obvious . unfortunately , for the experimental data investigated here , these two contributions can not be differentiated adequately .",
    "nevertheless , we clearly identified the first clear effect of defects on the critical behaviour . in an additional remark ,",
    "we want to stress that our observation of a finite value of the squared order parameter does not mean that there exists a finite bulk value for the order parameter above @xmath8 .",
    "the local order parameter clusters can be oriented in different directions in the order parameter space . if all clusters are oriented in one direction , a finite bulk value for the order parameter would result [ see ref .",
    "@xcite ] .    for the",
    "float - zone grown crystal a crossover of the critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be clearly observed as another effect of the defects [ see previous section ] , taking place at @xmath59 [ see fig.[fig : broad ] ] .",
    "this is the temperature range where the squared order parameter starts to be noticeable different from zero [ see fig.[fig : tc ] ] . in the general picture of the influence of defects on the critical behaviour",
    "these findings can be understood as follows . far away from the critical region",
    "mean - field exponents are expected , because fluctuations are small @xcite .",
    "these mean - field exponents are found indeed for the float - zone grown crystal for @xmath60 [ see fig.[fig : broad ] ] .",
    "lowering the temperature ( @xmath61 ) one has to take into account fluctuations and a crossover to non classical critical exponents should occur . without defects",
    ", one would expect the critical exponents for the 3d heisenberg model ( e.g.  @xmath62 @xcite ) .",
    "we find near the critical temperature for the float - zone grown crystal the value of the exponent @xmath63 [ see fig.[fig : broad ] ] , which differs substantially from the one stated above .",
    "because the correlation length becomes larger near the critical temperature , the critical fluctuations can become correlated over distances larger than the mean distance between the defects . in this case",
    "the impurities can change the critical behaviour and a crossover to a different critical exponent is possible .",
    "the harris criterium defines the necessary condition @xcite .",
    "if this condition is fulfilled , a dependence of the crossover temperature from the defect concentration should be observable .",
    "for the crystals probed here , with their different defect concentrations , we , indeed , find such a dependence [ see figs.[fig : broad],[fig : all_broad ] and table [ tab : samples ] ] .",
    "as described above the float - zone grown crystal has a crossover temperature equal to @xmath64 . for all other samples , except the reduced crystal ,",
    "the characteristic temperature @xmath38 is very small ( @xmath65 ) and thus the crossover itself is not visible in the experimental data .",
    "however , the critical exponents , obtained from power law fits to the data - sets in figure [ fig : all_broad ] , are smaller than @xmath66 but larger than the heisenberg - value @xmath67 .",
    "the crossover from the gaussian exponents ( e.g.  @xmath40 ) at high temperatures to the `` defect - induced '' exponents ( e.g.  @xmath50 ) close to the critical temperature should lead to effective exponents @xmath68 with values in the range @xmath69 , as observed .",
    "for the strongly reduced sample the crossover takes place at very high temperatures ( @xmath70 ) so that the exponent @xmath71 , similar to the value observed in the float - zone grown crystal , is found in the whole temperature range probed here .",
    "this again is in good agreement with the assumption that localized defects are responsible for the change in the critical behaviour . in the regime near the critical temperature",
    "@xmath8 a critical behaviour different from the homogenous case , i.e.  other critical exponents , should be observable .",
    "the critical exponents for systems with quenched disorder have been calculated before @xcite .",
    "those values can be compared with the critical exponents found in our experiments ( e.g. in an @xmath72-expansion for a 3-component order parameter @xmath73 with @xmath74 in three dimensions @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , we find in our experiments much higher values for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "one important question arises immediately : can we understand these findings within the concept of universality or are we facing non - universal behaviour ?",
    "a first hint is that we find the scaling relation @xmath75 still valid for all values of the critical exponents for the different crystals near the critical temperature [ see figs.[fig : broad],[fig : all_broad ] ] . as already discussed in the last section , the scaling relation for @xmath58 holds , too .    in order to fully understand the experimental data in terms of the influence of defects on the critical behaviour the high values for the critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 near @xmath8 need to be explained . in the next two subsections",
    "we try to provide a theory which can explain the observed values for the exponents and can model the crossover behaviour .      to investigate the questions arising from our experimental findings , the influence of local order parameter clusters , occuring above the critical temperature @xmath8 , on the critical behaviour is taken into account . at low defect concentrations the order parameter clusters are supposed to be well isolated .",
    "therefore , in the mean - field picture multiple local minima solutions exist , because the localized clusters can have different orientations in order parameter space @xcite .",
    "the properties of such ground states were discussed for spin - glasses @xcite , random - ferromagnets @xcite , and recently for quantum magnets @xcite . for random - ferromagnets dotsenko",
    "et al.@xcite found that the exponents calculated with the help of the replica - method are unstable with respect to a possible breaking of the replica symmetry .",
    "new exponents result , different from those obtained by the usual replica - method .",
    "even scenarios for possible instabilities of the theory are given . from these studies",
    "it is obvious that the states of minimal free energy in the partition function have to be considered in detail . in the present paper",
    "we sketch the theoretical derivation , for a more detailed discussion see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the starting point for the theoretical discussion is a ginzburg - landau model for continuous structural phase transitions in disordered systems with quenched impurities . until recently , in the standard approach only fluctuations around the homogeneous ground state of the order parameter @xmath76 were considered in the replica - method @xcite .",
    "we will incorporate fluctuations around the states with the lowest free energy in the partition function .",
    "the defect - functional used for the investigation of the effects of impurities on the free energy @xcite reads @xmath77 = \\int_{}^ { } d^dx   \\left [   \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , \\sum_{i=1}^{k } \\left (     ( a + u ) ( \\varphi^{i}({{\\mathbf{x}}}))^2   + ( \\nabla\\varphi^i({{\\mathbf{x}}}))^{2 }   \\right ) +   \\frac{b}{4 } \\ , [ \\sum_{i=1}^{k}(\\varphi^i({{\\mathbf{x}}}))^2]^2 \\right]\\ ] ] here @xmath78 denotes the component of the order parameter field , @xmath79 is the harmonic coefficient and vanishes at the bulk transition temperature @xmath80 of the pure system .",
    "the coefficient @xmath81 of the non - linear term has to be positive . with the short - range potentials",
    "@xmath82 the effects of randomly distributed defects at the sites @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are described .",
    "they can be considered as point like defects .    applying the replica - trick @xcite ,",
    "the averaging over different defect - distributions can be carried out , only taking into account fluctuations around the homogeneous ground state @xmath85 .",
    "the discussion of the resulting fixed - points and flow equations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to study the additional effect of possible order parameter clusters we start with the saddle - point approximation @xmath86 which gives the minimum solutions of the free energy .",
    "to keep the discussion transparent we choose the number of order - parameter components equal to one ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "as far as we consider defects which locally increase the transition temperature , local order parameter condensates exist above @xmath8 , as demonstrated in earlier studies @xcite . in fig.[fig : op_clus ] a typical order parameter configuration is sketched .",
    "thus in the presence of localized order parameter clusters , a more complicated solution of the ground state is found .",
    "however , as long as the concentration of the defects and the order parameter clusters is small , the value of @xmath88 outside these regions decays exponentially .",
    "the tail of such localized order parameter - clusters can approximately be written as @xmath89  @xcite . therefore , an approximation of the extremal solution is @xcite @xmath90 with @xmath91 possible solutions because of the ising symmetry in the order parameter space ( @xmath87 ) for a given defect distribution @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "no finite order parameter results for well isolated and non - interacting order parameter clusters @xcite .",
    "the clusters are of course temperature dependent , but we neglect this dependence here , assuming that in the temperature range where their contribution is most important the cluster structure does not change that much .",
    "now we can write the partition function @xmath94 in a way that we consider the global minimum solutions @xmath95 and fluctuations @xmath88 around these solutions @xmath96 =   \\int d\\varphi({{\\mathbf{x } } } ) \\sum_{p=1}^{l } \\e^{- { \\cal f } [ \\phi^{(p ) } [ { { \\mathbf{x } } } ; u ] + \\varphi({{\\mathbf{x}}});u ] }   =   \\int d\\varphi({{\\mathbf{x } } } ) \\e^{- { \\cal f } [ \\varphi;u ] } \\cdot \\tilde{z}[u ] \\ , \\ ] ] where the part of @xmath94 with the contributions from the saddle point solutions is written as @xmath97 = \\sum_{p=1}^{l } \\e^{- { \\cal f } [ \\phi^{(p)};u ] } \\cdot \\e^ { -\\int d^{d}x [ \\frac{3 \\ , b}{2 } \\",

    "thus , we are still investigating the effect of frozen disorder .",
    "because the system with defects is no longer translationally invariant , the trace in the partition function can no longer be treated in the usual way .",
    "the replica - method will be used to deal with the problem .",
    "an additional remark concerning the energy barriers should be made . in our approach",
    "the existence of large energy barriers between the various saddle - point configurations is assumed .",
    "unlike in glasses these barriers are not infinite .",
    "but as already pointed out by narayanan et al.@xcite in the thermodynamical limit these barriers tend to infinity . as a consequence also",
    "the dynamics of the clusters should be very slow .",
    "this gives us the possibility to consider just the statics and to neglect effects of relaxation and reorientation .    performing the disorder average with the help of the replica trick by considering @xmath24 replicas , the effect of order parameter clusters",

    "firstly , a distribution function for the local order parameter clusters @xmath104 is presumed @xcite . with",
    "that we interpret the solutions arising from the saddle - point approximation as random variables , even though for a given distribution of defects these solutions are fixed .",

    "calculated to one - loop order ( @xmath125 ) , is reached , if the initial value for @xmath124 is small . for larger initial values of the defect strength a direct crossover from the mean - field fixed - point to",
    "the `` defect - induced '' fixed - point is found .",
    "the width of the temperature where the crossover occurs , also varies with the initial values of @xmath124 and @xmath81 .",
    "assuming @xmath126 , we can obtain the experimentally found critical exponent @xmath127 for @xmath128 , that is in the critical regime .",
    "the temperature scale where the crossover takes place is dependend on the initial values of the coupling constants . by matching the temperature scale @xcite ,",
    "the crossover can be modeled , too . for",
    "the float - zone grown sample the resulting fit of the experimental data is shown in fig.[fig : kappa_fit ] .    despite the remarkable agreement between theory and experimental findings one should be aware of the fact that this is only a one loop result . with a higher order in a loop expansion a similar fit might well require a different value for @xmath116 . through the two approximations , defined in the last subsection , a lot of physical effects which are very hard to model are condensed into the parameter @xmath116 .",
    "the next goal of the theory should be to determine the value of @xmath116 and to answer the question if this parameter depends on the defect strength or the defect concentration .",
    "dotsenko et al .",
    "expressed their hope that @xmath116 may be determined in higher order in @xmath72 , in which case universal exponents for a paticular class of defect sysems would result .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the effects of defects on the critical behaviour at structural phase transitions .",
    "our experiments probed the @xmath1 phase transition of srtio@xmath0 and the influence of oxygen vacancies for different srtio@xmath0 crystals .",
    "we found in our experiments that the squared order parameter is non - vanishing and rounded above the critical temperature @xmath8 , representing the transtion temperature for a perfect crystal .",
    "the rounded squared order parameter increases above this temperature with increasing concentration of oxygen vacancies in the crystals .",
    "these effects were interpreted as a result of local order parameter clusters occuring above @xmath8 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    furthermore , near @xmath8 unusual high values for the critical exponents @xmath3 und @xmath4 were found in our experiments .",
    "for the float zone grown crystal we were also able to study a crossover of the critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 in great detail . in addition , we identified a dependence of the crossover - temperature on the defect concentration of the respective samples .",
    "the crossover scenario was analyzed in the framework of the renormalization - group theory ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . two main effects could be studied here .",
    "firstly , the correlation length of the critical fluctuations has to exceed the length scale of the mean distance between oxygen vacancies in order to change the values of the critical exponents of the homogeneous system .",
    "secondly , the unusual high values for the critical exponents found experimentally below the crossover temperature , which indicate the crossover from classical to non - classical critical behaviour , could be explained by taking into account the fluctuations around the states of minimal free energy and the resulting breaking of the replica symmetry .    because of the occurence of the paramter @xmath116 within the theory , which can not be determined explicitly , some questions concerning the universal aspects of the results are still open .",
    "two scenarios are possible : ( i ) the parameter @xmath116 is universal for certain classes of defect systems ; ( ii ) the parameter @xmath116 depends on microscopic properties of the crystals and is not universal .",
    "we stated some hints that for the class of defect systems studied here universal behaviour occurs .",
    "it is known from defect models @xcite that in three dimensions there is a minimum strength of defects . below this border",
    "no order parameter clusters form and the analyzed crossover should not occur",
    ".    it would be interesting to study similar systems in the presence of different kinds of defects or to study systems where the universality class can be changed , e.g. under pressure .",
    "also further theoretical investigations are necessary to get a step beyond the approximations considered in this and in other papers that take into account the breaking of the replica - symmetry .",
