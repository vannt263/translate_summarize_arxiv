    "after being established that neutrinos are massive and mixed particles @xcite , one of the most interesting current issues in flavor physics is to elucidate if neutrinos are dirac or majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "if neutrinos turn out to be majorana particles , important consequences as lepton number - violating ( lnv ) processes@xcite and further sources of cp violation become possible @xcite .",
    "searches for lnv processes ( where the lepton number is violated in two units , @xmath5 ) in dedicated low energy experiments as neutrinoless double beta decays , have led to very strong constraints on the effective mass of light majorana neutrinos @xcite since the rates for these processes are driven by the effective mass parameter @xmath6 @xcite . on the other hand , very restrictive bounds on @xmath7 can be obtained by combining neutrino oscillation data @xcite , cosmological bounds @xcite and tritium beta decay @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these sub - ev bounds on the scale of effective majorana masses are at the sensitivity reaches of current experimental projects @xcite .",
    "as it has been extensively discussed by many authors , the existence of very light neutrinos may find a natural explanation by means of heavy neutrinos via the see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "heavy neutrinos naturally appears in some extensions of the standard model and may play an important role in cosmology and various particle physics and astrophysical processes @xcite .",
    "the possibility to observe the effects of heavier neutrinos , accessible in the kinematical range of current experiments , is very exciting as they can induce large rates for @xmath5 decays through the mechanism of resonant enhancement @xcite .",
    "indeed , the appearance of sterile neutrinos with masses in the range of hundreds of mev s to a few gev s is possible in scenarios of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking as shown for instance in @xcite . by means of the resonant mechanism , neutrinos with these intermediate mass scales",
    "can produce an enhancement in the three - body @xmath5 decays of pseudoscalar mesons @xmath8 and the tau lepton @xmath9 ; these decay processes have been extensively studied by many authors @xcite in the cases where final state hadrons can be pseudoscalar or vector mesons .",
    "so far , some experimental uppers bounds have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite ; very recently , by using 36 pb@xmath10 of integrated luminosity , the lhcb collaboration has been able to derive upper limits for lnv charged @xmath0 meson decays @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these studies are expected to be extended by the lhcb experiment by including the @xmath12 decay modes @xcite , which toghether with similar analyses that can be performed at the superb flavor factories @xcite makes very attractive the studies of lnv @xmath0 meson decays .",

    "these @xmath5 decays of neutral @xmath0 mesons have not been investigated before neither from a theoretical nor from an experimental point of view .",
    "in addition , we also consider and update the analogous four - body @xmath16 decays ( @xmath17 ) , which was previously studied in @xcite , since one naively expects it can be largely enhanced due to the resonances in the virtual @xmath18 boson and heavy neutrino exchanges .",

    "contributions containing the properly antisymmetrized contributions due to the exchange of identical leptons in the final state must be added to these diagrams .",

    "also , as it was mentioned in the introduction , there are good perspectives at the lhcb experiment which can provide sensitive improvements on these lnv decays in the dimuon channel based on the analysis already done in the case of lnv searches in @xmath105 meson decays @xcite . regarding the top quark @xmath5 decays , the sensitivies that can be reached at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are not sufficient to test our predictions , as it has been discussed in ref .",

    ", one can expect that branching ratios of @xmath2 for @xmath91 decays could be accessible .",
    "the existence of lepton number - violating transitions with @xmath5 , is considered to be the cleanest manifestation of neutrinos as majorana particles .",
    "direct searches of these decays in neutrinoless double beta nuclear decays indicate that masses for very light majorana neutrinos lie at the sub - ev scale .",
    "similarly , in the framework where only three light neutrinos exist , the majorana masses of all neutrinos are strongly constrained from current oscillation , cosmological bounds and tritium beta decay .    in the present paper",
    "we have studied the potential of heavy flavor four - body @xmath5 decays to shed some light on the masses and couplings of heavier majorana neutrinos .",
    "if the masses of such neutrinos produce a resonance enhancement of these heavy flavor decays , the corresponding branching ratios turns out to be , in the most optimistic cases , at the level of @xmath2 for neutral @xmath0 meson and top quarks decays if the most restrictive current bounds on neutrino mixings ( set i ) are used .",
    "these branching fractions of four - body neutral @xmath0 meson decays are at the level of the upper bounds obtained in experimental studies of @xmath106 three - body decays .",
    "thus , their searches at current and future experimental facilities can be helpful to provide complementary constrains to the ones derived from three - body decays of @xmath107 leptons and charged @xmath0 and @xmath103 mesons .",
