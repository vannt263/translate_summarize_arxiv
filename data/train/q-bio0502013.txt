    "the rapidly expanding field of network analysis , reviewed in @xcite , has provided examples of networks exhibiting  accelerating \" network growth , where total link number grows faster than linearly with network size @xcite . for instance , the internet and world wide web appear to grow by adding links more quickly than sites @xcite though the relative change over time is small @xcite .",
    "similarly , both the number of links per substrate in the metabolic networks of organisms @xcite and the average number of links per scientist in collaboration networks increases linearly over time @xcite , while also languages appear to evolve via accelerated growth @xcite .",
    "these studies have motivated examinations of stochastic accelerating networks where the number of new links added is probabilistic ( though integral and greater than one ) causing network transitions from scale - free to exponential statistics @xcite .",
    "these previous studies of deterministic or stochastic networks have typically considered networks where every node has at least one connection which constrains the rate of acceleration that can be considered . in particular , if each new node added to a network of @xmath0 nodes is accompanied by @xmath1 new links with acceleration parameter @xmath2 , then ensuring that the network is less than fully connected constrains acceleration parameters to the range @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "equivalent limits were considered in ref .",
    "however , real networks can contain a majority of nodes that are entirely unconnected  many computers are unconnected or only intermittently connected to the internet and many people are unconnected nodes in social or sexual contacts networks .",
    "modelling networks where a substantial proportion of the nodes are unconnected requires a probabilistic approach in which the number of links added with each new node scales as @xmath4 for some probability parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the introduction of a probabilistic envelope lifts constraints on the acceleration parameter allowing networks displaying deceleration @xmath6 , no acceleration @xmath7 , acceleration @xmath3 , and hyper - acceleration @xmath8 .",
    "hyper - accelerating probabilistic networks with @xmath9 and @xmath8 are not merely of theoretical interest , and appear for instance in prokaryote gene regulatory networks where many gene nodes are unregulated and merely constitutively or stochastically expressed @xcite .",
    "prokaryote gene regulatory networks are sparsely connected ( @xmath10 ) and display hyper - acceleration @xmath11 as established by independent comparative genomics analyses @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to their reliance on sequence homology interactions between protein transcription factors and specific promoter binding sequences sites @xcite . in these regulatory networks , outbound regulatory links",
    "are preferentially attached to existing regulator nodes as gene duplication events contribute to up to 75% of each of new genes @xcite and regulatory transcription factors @xcite . in contrast , inbound links to regulated nodes are randomly formed due to the random drift of gene promotor sequences , although their subsequent fixation is determined by selection .",

    "we examine probabilistic networks growing through the preferential attachment of new links to existing connected network nodes , while in section [ sect_random ] we examine growing probabilistic networks featuring the random attachment of new links to all existing nodes .",
    "we consider networks growing through the sequential addition of numbered nodes @xmath15 for @xmath16 where at network size @xmath17 , node @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) has @xmath20 undirected links .",
    "the addition of node @xmath15 and its @xmath21 links will increase the probable number of links attached to existing nodes @xmath18 for @xmath22 so @xmath23 .",
    "we assume new links are added only with each arriving node ( so no new links are added between established nodes ) , and that the average number of new links attached to node @xmath15 on its entry to the network is a function of network size @xmath24 where the probability constant @xmath14 satisfies @xmath5 .",
    "this average is then a decreasing function of network size for @xmath6 , constant for @xmath7 , and an increasing function of network size for @xmath25 .",

    "there are two types of network connectivity transitions which have been of interest in the literature .",
    "the first occurs when a growing network changes from sparse to dense connectivity as this change necessarily implies that the final connectivity statistics will become exponential in nature .",
    "that is , while a sparsely connected network can possess either scale - free or exponential statistics , a densely connected network must exhibit exponential statistics ( as multiple connections are not allowed between any two given nodes ) .",
    "this transition occurs for undirected links when approximately @xmath49 .",
    "the second transition of interest occurs when the connected nodes coalesce to form a single giant island of interconnected nodes . to borrow results from random graph theory @xcite ( which have been roughly validated for accelerating biological networks @xcite ) , the giant island",
    "is expected to form when approximately @xmath50 .",
    "we now investigate the dependence of these transitions on the acceleration parameter @xmath13 .",
    "it is evident that decelerating networks with @xmath6 are very sparsely connected so neither of the dense connectivity or giant island transitions will occur .",
    "hereinafter , we only consider accelerating networks with @xmath2 .",
    "for such networks , the dense connectivity and giant island transitions will occur respectively at the points @xmath51 this establishes that , for instance , non - accelerating networks with @xmath7 can never undergo a transition to a densely connected regime for any choice of the probability parameter @xmath14 for large network sizes @xmath0 , though these networks can form giant islands with network growth as long as @xmath52 .",
    "this inability to become densely connected remains for all accelerating regimes @xmath53 , but dense connectivity can emerge in the hyper - acceleration regime . at this point with @xmath11 , growing networks can undergo a transition to the densely connected regime when the probability parameter is large , @xmath54 . for yet higher acceleration rates",
    "@xmath12 , all growing networks undergo a transition to the dense connectivity regime and display single giant islands , and these transitions occur at network sizes determined by the probability parameter @xmath14 .    in the following sections , we determine the connectivity statistics for accelerating and hyper - accelerating networks under both preferential and random attachment of new links to established nodes .",
    "we now turn to consider accelerating and hyper - accelerating networks ( @xmath2 ) where new links are principally preferentially attached to existing connected nodes .",
    "the final generated link distribution will depend on the balance of different countervailing trends , namely the respective weights given to preferential versus random attachment , and the magnitude of the acceleration parameter which influences both the rate at which links are attached to newer nodes and the rate at which while older nodes accumulate links .",
