    "the low energy physics of weakly interacting fermions in three dimensions is mostly described by the landau theory of the fermi liquid which is based on the existence of single particle fermionic excitations , or quasiparticles , with a long lifetime at very low energies@xcite . however , moving away from three dimensions , the situation changes drastically : in one dimensional systems landau s quasiparticles are typically unstable , giving rise to the so called luttinger liquid@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "two dimensional lattice models are far more complicated to treat , since conventional perturbation theory is not applicable , and many instabilities can occur@xmath6 .",
    "the appearance of broken symmetry phases due to electron interactions within the landau description of a fermi liquid has been the subject of numerous investigations@xcite . in particular , pomeranchuk instabilities leading to nematic phases",
    "have been analized by yamase and kohno in ref . .",
    "of special interest are those phases that are still described by landau s theory , such as metallic ferromagnetism or incommensurate density waves . in ref .",
    "a new type of instability was discussed that lead to a phase in which the two fermi surfaces for up and down spins get a relative shift in momentum space .",
    "this so - called spin - split phase ( or @xmath7-phase@xcite ) , which breaks reflection symmetry but preserves time reversal ( as opposed to a ferromagnetic metallic instability ) was shown to appear in the presence of interactions that arise naturally in a tight binding description of interacting electrons .",
    "the same author have analyzed the competition of this kind of interactions with rashba and dresselhaus ones@xcite .",
    "the subject has regained interest more recently , due to its possible relevance in the description of different phase transitions observed experimentally , such as the so - called hidden order transition in uru@xmath3si@xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , in ref .",
    "the possible relevance of spin - antisymmetric interactions in the stability of the fermi liquid and the relation with this hidden order transition has been discussed .",
    "recent measurements , showing rotational symmetry breaking in the hidden - order phase@xcite , motivated the proposal of a nematic emergent phase@xcite , in contrast to previous scenarios@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to analyze further this issue by applying a method that has been recently developed in refs .",
    ", , , which is specially suited to study the fermi liquid instabilities in two - dimensional lattice systems .",
    "this technique allows to analyze the interplay between an external magnetic field and the underlying lattice .",
    "in particular , we apply the extension of the above mentioned method to the zero - temperature@xcite and spinful case @xcite to the class of interactions studied in .",
    "our results show two important characteristic features . on the one hand pomeranchuk instabilities appear when the fermi surface deformations are of the spin - split type and this leads in general to an enhancement of the instability region . on the other hand , and",
    "more importantly , with this kind of deformations a reentrant behaviour in a magnetic field is observed , similar to what is observed in _",
    "e.g. _ uru@xmath3si@xmath3 and sr@xmath4ru@xmath3o@xmath5 .",
    "these results should be compared with the analysis presented in where reentrant behaviour was observed analyzing nematic deformations of the fermi surface . here",
    "we obtain a similar behavior , without imposing nematic deformations , for a different kind ( spin - split ) of fermi surface deformations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we present the hamiltonian of the system and its description as a landau fermi liquid , in section [ sec : method ] we briefly review the generalized pomeranchuk method for lattice systems@xcite , and in section [ sec : results ] we present the main results of this paper . finally in section [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the conclusions and outlook .",
    "we study a system of fermions in a two - dimensional square lattice with a spin - antisymmetric interaction@xcite .",

    "we consider in this paper the dispersion relation @xmath11 which corresponds to nearest neighbor hopping ( * k*)=-2t(+ ) [ eq : disprel ] , the analysis of more general cases being straightforward .    for the interaction , following@xcite we choose @xmath12 in the antisymmetric spin channels _ * k**k*=_l _ l p_l ( ) .",

    "the way of parameterizing the space of excitations and exploring it in the search for possible instabilities is the core of the generalized pomeranchuk method , and will be sketched in the next section .",
    "in this section we give a brief description of the generalization of pomeranchuk s method to lattice systems , that was originally proposed in ref . and further developed in and . here",
    "we concentrate in the spin @xmath23 case at zero temperature , with a dispersion relation ( [ eq : disprel ] ) and interaction function ( [ eq : intfunct ] ) and we refer the reader to ref . for details .",
    "the ground state of a spin @xmath23 system at zero temperature is described by its fermi surfaces . with the help of the function @xmath24",

    "an excitation of the system @xmath19 takes the values @xmath27 at different @xmath14 points , and in consequence it can be characterized by a deformed fermi surface .",

    "we have the deformations of the unperturbed fermi surface corresponding to the @xmath7 component ( @xmath39 ) parameterized in terms of two arbitrary functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 of a single variable @xmath42 .",
    "the generality of this decomposition can be understood by replacing it into the expressions for the variations of the magnetization and the total number of particles .",
    "when @xmath43 has no constant term it parameterizes a simultaneous deformation of both fermi surfaces that do not change the magnetization of the system nor the total number of particles .",
    "stoner instabilities , due to fluctuations in the number of particles , can be also included by allowing a constant term in @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand @xmath44 takes into account deformations that include spin flips , changing the total magnetization .    inserting the above decomposition into the variation of the landau free energy ( [ eq : deltae ] ) , after some straightforward algebra@xcite , we get = ds ds _ a , b=1,2 ^a(s ) k^ab ( s , s ) ^b(s ) [ eq : deltaomega ] as we have chosen both variables @xmath42 as running in the same interval , we are allowed to omit the index @xmath7 in the dumb integration variables . here",
