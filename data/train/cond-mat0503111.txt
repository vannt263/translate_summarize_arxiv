    "since the realization of the bose - einstein condensed ( bec ) atomic gases @xcite , there has been much interest in ultracold trapped atomic systems to study quantum many - body phenomena . besides the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite , one can now study degenerate atomic fermi gases @xcite and bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "these systems offer great promise to exhibit new and interesting phenomena of quantum many - particle physics . an important diagnostic signal for these systems",
    "is the spectrum of collective excitations .",
    "such oscillations are common to a variety of many - particle systems and are often sensitive to the interaction and the structure of the ground state .    however , for harmonically trapped gases of either bosonic or fermionic atoms , the frequencies of the density oscillations are quite insensitive to the strength of the interaction . in particular , the dipole oscillation frequency is completely independent of the interaction @xcite .",
    "as we will see , excitations where the two components move out of phase ( spin excitations ) behave quite differently .",
    "the underlying theoretical tool to treat dynamic problems of dilute quantum gases is time - dependent mean field theory .",
    "this reduces to the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for small amplitudes , and the theory in this form has been applied to density oscillations of these systems @xcite . when the single - particle spectrum is regular , the long - wavelength excitations are collective and simpler methods can be used to calculate the frequencies , in particular with sum rules @xcite or the scaling approximation @xcite . in this work",
    "we will follow the last approach , which we believe is justified by the extreme regularity of the harmonic trapping potential .",
    "the scaling method is physically quite transparent , but it is in fact equivalent to the theory based on energy - weighted sum rules @xcite , as used for example in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the dilute limit",
    ", the interaction in a two - component fermion condensate is characterized by a single number , the scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "we will only consider here the case of positive scattering lengths which correspond to a repulsive interaction .",
    "when the interaction is attractive , the system is superfluid in its ground state and the excitation properties are controlled by the energy gap .",
    "the ground state properties of the two - component fermion system with a repulsive interaction was treated by sogo and yabu @xcite , who showed that there are three regimes , depending on interaction strength . for small interaction strengths ,",
    "the ground state has equal densities of the two components , which we call the `` paramagnetic '' regime .",
    "beyond a certain threshold in interaction strength , the ground state becomes `` ferromagnetic '' , that is with a unequal densities of the two components . at very large interaction strengths",
    ", the minority component vanishes .",
    "we shall call this the single - component phase . in this work",
    ", we will treat systems in the presence of an external magnetic field , which will produce a net spin in the ground state even the paramagnetic regime .",
    "we now briefly describe the spin modes that could be excited by a time - dependent external magnetic field .",
    "the simplest field to consider is one that is spatially uniform .",
    "however , such fields can not change the spatial part of the single - particle wave functions of the condensate and do not induce internal excitations .",
    "the response to a uniform field is identical to that of a noninteracting ensemble of @xmath1 atoms , where @xmath2 is the number of atoms in component @xmath3 .",
    "the next field to consider has a dipole spatial dependence . due to the constraints of maxwell s equations , the overall multipolarity of such a field is @xmath4 , but we shall follow the common terminology calling it dipole . the spin - dipole mode has been discussed previously in in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite treats the the spin dipole mode as overdamped and does not discuss its frequency . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin dipole response was calculated in rpa for a particular value of the coupling strength , and it was found to be rather narrow and close to the unperturbed oscillation frequency . in our work here , we will calculate the frequency under a variety of conditions : different coupling strengths and in the presence of an external static magnetic field .",
    "the damping of the mode is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "we begin with the expression for the energy of a dilute trapped condensate in the mean - field approximation : @xmath5 . \\label{etot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 are orbital wave functions indexed by spin @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the longitudinal and transverse frequencies of the trapping field , @xmath9 is the coupling strength of a contact interaction , @xmath10 are the magnetic moments of the atoms , and @xmath11 is an external magnetic field .",
    "the densities @xmath12 are given by the usual sum over occupied orbitals : @xmath13 .",
    "we shall use the thomas - fermi approximation to evaluate the first term , the kinetic energy .",
    "we can then make a change of variables to simplify the appearance of the thomas - fermi equations , similar to the scaling defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . with the scaled variables and the thomas - fermi approximation ,",
    "the expression for the energy is , up to an additive constant , @xmath14 . \\label{etottfs}\\ ] ] here the variables are defined @xmath15 the tf equations for the densities @xmath16 are derived by variation of the energy ( 3 ) with a constraint on the total number of particles .",
    "this yields @xmath17 in this equation the lagrange multiplier @xmath18 has the meaning of the fermi energy .",
    "the solution of these equations in the absence of a magnetic field is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "these authors make an additional rescaling to eliminate @xmath9 , but we do not do that here . for any positive @xmath9 , there is a value of @xmath18 above which the system becomes ferromagnetic . at @xmath19 ,",
    "the critical point is at @xmath20 .",
    "below that value , the minimum energy is obtained for the paramagnetic phase , having @xmath21 .",
    "just above that value , both components are present but the densities are unequal .",
    "when @xmath18 is increased past @xmath22 , the system goes into a single - component phase in the center of the trap , at @xmath23 .",
    "away from the center of the trap , the fermi energy is effectively reduced , allowing the paramagnetic phase to persist in the outer part of the condensate cloud .",
    "thus the minority component will form a hollow sphere , which we will call the hollow spin phase .",
    "now consider the effect of a magnetic field . if @xmath24 , the densities @xmath16 will unequal no matter what the value of @xmath9 .",
    "still , one can distinguish two kinds of behavior near the center of the trap . if the densities of both spins decrease as one moves away from the center , we shall call it paramagnetic .",
    "however , for a certain range of parameters , the density of the minority component may increase initially , moving away from the center .",
    "this is the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the system can also form the hollow spin phases in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "when the external magnetic field @xmath25 increases more , the minority component disappears completely , giving what we call the single - spin phase .",
    "density profiles illustrating these three regimes are shown in fig .",
    "the panels show the densities as a function of distance @xmath26 in a weak magnetic field ( @xmath27 ) and at three different interaction strengths : @xmath28(a ) , 1.05(b ) and 1.15(c ) . from top to bottom , the panels show paramagnetic ( a ) , ferromagnetic ( b ) , and the hollow spin phases ( c ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the scaled density distribution of major and minor components of fermions .",
    "the phase boundaries as function of @xmath25 and @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "the upper and lower columns show same results , but in the lower column the vertical line is rescaled by factor @xmath29 .",
    "the dashed lines represents the border between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases , which is given by @xmath30 at @xmath23 .",
    "the solid line represents the results solved by @xmath31 in eq.([tfeq ] ) .",
    "this line crosses the dashed line at @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the curvature of the minority component density , @xmath34 at @xmath23 , is negative when @xmath35 and positive when @xmath36 this solid line shows the border between the single and paramagnetic spin phases when @xmath35 , and the border between the ferromagnetic and hollow spin phases when @xmath35 .    in the hollow phases",
    "there are two boundaries for the minority fermion density where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . on this boundary",
    "the density of majority fermion must satisfy @xmath39 here we should consider the following function : @xmath40 the derivative of the above equation is @xmath41 since @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 becomes maximum at @xmath46 .",
    "thus @xmath47 is required , otherwise @xmath48 , and there is no boundary of @xmath49 , which means @xmath50 in all regions . from",
    "that we can obtain the condition for @xmath51 as @xmath52 the long - dashed represents @xmath53 for @xmath54 , which means the border between the hollow and single spin phases .    in fig .",
    "[ nasym ] we plot the number asymmetry between two components @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "when the external magnetic field is small , the asymmetry of the fermion number is very small and almost independent of the coupling in the paramagnetic phase ( @xmath57 ) except when the coupling is very small , where the system is close to the border between the paramagnetic and single spin phases .",
    "as the coupling increases further and exceeds about @xmath58 , the system is changed from the paramagnetic spin phase to the ferromagnetic one .",
    "the number asymmetry of the fermion number also increases as the external magnetic field becomes larger , the change of the number asymmetry is not drastic , though the rapid change of the dipole frequency still remains .",
    "in this section we derive an expression for the dipole frequency using the scaling method . without loss of generality , we take the direction of motion along the @xmath59-axis .",
    "the time - varying density will be parameterized with a collective coordinate @xmath60 as @xcite .",
    "@xmath61 where @xmath62 is the density distribution of the ground state . substituting eq.([dscl ] ) into eq .",

    "then the classical equation of motion for @xmath69 is harmonic , giving rise to the following eigenvalue equation for the oscillation frequencies , @xmath70    the eigenvalues of this equation are given@xmath71    one eigenvalue is @xmath72 with the eigenvector @xmath73 .",
    "this is the in - phase oscillation of the system which follows kohn s theorem .",
    "the other eigenvalue is @xmath74 the eigenvector is given by @xmath75 . in this mode , the two components move in opposite directions keeping their center of mass at rest .",
    "here we should give a comment .",
    "if we consider the dipole oscillation in the transverse relation , the frequency normalized by the transverse trapped frequency @xmath76 is also equivalent to the right - hand - side of eq.([frdp ] ) .    using the variable transformation explained in the previous sections , the dipole frequency is written as @xmath77 where @xmath78    in fig .",
    "[ dqplg ] we show the frequency of the dipole oscillation in the out - of - phase oscillation as a function of the coupling constant , @xmath9 , with various external magnetic fields , @xmath79 ( dashed ) , @xmath80 ( solid ) , 1.0@xmath81 ( long - dashed ) , and 5.0@xmath81 ( chain - dotted ) , respectively . for comparison",
    "we also show the frequencies in the symmetric system in zero magnetic field ( dotted line ) .",
    "as the coupling becomes larger , the dipole frequency decreases monotonically until @xmath58 , and sharply increases above that . for @xmath57 , where the number asymmetry is small ,",
    "the frequency @xmath82 does not strongly depend on the external magnetic field . in the paramagnetic spin phase ( @xmath83 )",
    ", the density distribution of the minor component of fermion @xmath49 is similar to that of the major component @xmath84 , and the integrand in @xmath85 ( [ rsfa ] ) is positive in all regions .",
    "as the coupling increases , the size of the fermi gas becomes larger , and then the frequency @xmath82 monotonously decreases .    as the coupling becomes",
    "@xmath86 one component of the fermions is partially converted into the other component , and ferromagnetism appears in the central region . in fig .",

    "the contribution from this ferromagnetic region to @xmath92 is negative .",
    "as the coupling increase , the critical position @xmath93 moves to the surface , @xmath94 becomes smaller , and then @xmath82 increases .    in the case of a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the qualitative behavior is similar . in strong coupling",
    "@xmath86 the slope of the density function for the minor fermion @xmath49 is smaller in the strong magnetic field than that in the weak magnetic field .",
    "as the external magnetic field increases , the dipole frequency becomes smaller .",
    "in this section we study the monopole oscillation in spherical trap , @xmath95 . generally the monopole and quadrupole oscillations are coupled , but qualitative properties are not so significant difference between the two collective oscillations . in order to study the monopole oscillation , we introduce the following scaling : @xmath96 under this scaling the total energy becomes @xmath97 where the @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the kinetic and harmonic oscillator energy parts in the ground state , respectively .",

    "[ mplg]a we also plot the frequencies of out - of - phase and in - phase modes in the symmetric system without external magnetic field with the thin long - dashed and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "the frequencies of the in - phase oscillation in the symmetric system is about @xmath116 , which is the frequency in a non - interacting trapped ideal gas , for any asymmetry .",
    "as the coupling constant increases , on the other hand , the frequency of the out - of - phase mode monotonously decreases .    in the weak coupling @xmath83 ,",
    "the frequencies of the mode-1 and mode-2 are almost same as those of the in - phase and out - of - phase modes in the symmetric system .",

    "when the coupling constant increases further , the frequency of the out - of - phase mode approaches to that of the in - phase mode , and the level mixing between the two modes occurs . even after the level mixing , the frequency of the mode-1 increases while the frequency of the mode-2 rarely vary .",
    "from those we can suppose that the modes-1 and -2 are almost out - of - phase and in - phase modes , though the two modes are mixed and exchange their roles in strong coupling .    in order to confirm that , here , we calculate the mixing angle @xmath118 defined as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is an eigenvector obtained from eq.([monoeq ] ) .",

    "around @xmath124 , the modes-1 and -2 are mixed , and the two collective modes exchange their roles in the strong interaction limit .",
    "this feature is less clear , but also seen in the case of the strong magnetic field ( fig .",

    "in this paper we study the spin excitation on the dipole and monopole oscillations in the asymmetric two - component fermion condensed system using the scaling method . as for the dipole oscillations",
    "the in - phase and the out - of - phase modes are completely decoupled even in the asymmetric system .",
    "the two modes can be coupled in the monopole oscillation , but these two modes are rarely mixed except when their frequencies are close .    in all kinds of oscillations",
    "the in - phase motions do not have any special behavior even if the two components are largely asymmetric .",
    "the frequencies of the in - phase modes are not so different from those of the non - interacting system .",
    "on the other hand the frequencies of these out - of - phase oscillations monotonously decreases as the repulsive force between the two kinds of fermions becomes larger .",
    "as the coupling further increases , the system changes to ferromagnetic and , the frequencies of the out - of - phase oscillations very suddenly increase , thought those of the in - phase oscillations do not vary even if the ferromagnetism appears .",
    "in addition the frequencies and m1 excitation strength show differences between different number asymmetry for @xmath86 , where the ferromagnetism appears .",
    "thus significant information of many body systems can be gotten only from the out - of - phase oscillations . in this work",
    "we describe the two components of fermions with different two spin states .",
    "it may be thought to be difficult to establish such experiments because we need two kinds of external magnetic fields to control the interaction and the asymmetry .",
    "however a similar work can be done in systems including two different kinds of fermi gases , where we do not need an external magnetic field to construct the asymmetry .",
    "if we use two kinds of fermions with different masses , we can study a variety of systems .        for reviews ,",
