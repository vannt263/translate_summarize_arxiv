    "@xcite @xmath116 provides a rough measure of the crossover temperature @xmath112 .",
    "it is thus clear that in real systems where impurities can not be avoided impurities will dominate below @xmath112 . for this reason one",
    "expects that the nature of a mean - field snq transition , where @xmath5 tends to zero in the overdoped regime , is dominated by disorder and , on the mean - field level , a dsnq transition is expected to occur .",
    "an essential requirement for the existence of the doping tuned 2d- isq and 3d - snq transitions is the 2d-3d crossover .",

    "the data reveal consistency with a 2d - isq transition , where for @xmath125 the scaling relation @xmath123 @xmath126 ( eq.([eq1 ] ) ) holds . according to fig.[fig3 ] , this conclusion is also supported  by the characteristic behavior of a 2d - isq transition , the linear relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath127 ( eq.([eq2 ] ) ) in the underdoped regime .    in the overdoped regime , matters are much less clear .",
    "indeed , there is just one data point ( @xmath128 in fig.[fig2 ] ) favoring the suppression of @xmath129 in the overdoped limit .",
    "even from the plot @xmath5 versus @xmath130 ( fig.[fig3 ] ) , which is not affected by uncertainties in the dopant concentration , no clear - cut conclusion can be drawn . to indicate the drastically different behavior of  the dsnq and csnq transition , we sketched in figs .. [fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , the crossover from the 2d - isq critical point to a 3d - snq  or mean - field dsnq - transition in terms of dashed and solid curves , while the dotted one mimics the crossover from the 2d - isq - to a csnq - transition , respectively .",
    "since in any real cuprate superconductor , impurities and imperfections are present , there is in a d - wave superconductor a temperature @xmath112 ( see eq.([eq33 ] ) ) , below which disorder dominates . in the snq transition @xmath79 tends to zero as @xmath131  ( eq .",

    "it is thus evident that sufficiently close to the overdoped limit the critical behavior of the snq transition will be dominated by disorder .",

    "the data clearly reveals that in overdoped films both , @xmath5 and @xmath130 , are systematically reduced @xmath137 @xcite.thus , the strength of disorder has a strong influence on the crossover from the 3d - isq to the snq transition . for nearly clean samples it will be difficult to enter the regime where disorder controls the snq transition . to illustrate this point we consider the doping dependence of @xmath138 at low temperatures . in fig.[fig5 ] we displayed the data of panagopoulos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for la@xmath136sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 at various dopant concentrations . in the doping and temperature range , @xmath139 and @xmath140 @xmath141 respectively ,",
    "the data is fully consistent with a linear temperature dependence and the magnitude of @xmath142 increases with increasing dopant concentration .",
    "although this systematic behavior clearly uncovers d - wave superconductivity and points to a clean mean - field csnq transition , a crossover to a disorder dominated snq transition , setting in around @xmath143 , can not be ruled out .",
    "indeed , fits to the interpolation formula ( eq.([eq33 ] ) @xcite  yield for the crossover temperature the estimates @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 . for @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "noting that the data resulting from the linear fits @xmath155 are also included in figs.([fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the data shown in those figures stems from rather clean samples , where the disorder dominated snq  regime is pushed rather close to the overdoped limit . to substantiate the occurrence of intermediate clean snq behavior further , we turn to the doping dependence of @xmath156 @xcite and @xmath157 @xcite displayed in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "these properties scale linearly over the attained doping range , approach a constant value in the underdoped limit and their magnitude increases systematically with dopant concentration @xmath6 .",
    "this is just , of what one would expect , in a crossover from the 2d - isq transition with @xmath53 to a clean d - wave mean - field snq transition . indeed , close to the 2d - isq transition with @xmath53 , @xmath158 holds ( eq.([eq11 ] ) ) , while close to the clean mean - field snq transition , where eq.([eq28 ] ) , rewritten in form @xmath159 applies .",
    "the solid curve in fig.[fig6 ] corresponds to this asymptotic behavior with @xmath160 taken from @xmath161 and @xmath162 @xmath163 derived from the data shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "in contrast , in the experimentally attained doping regime , the data is inconsistent with a fluctuation dominated 3d - snq transition , where @xmath164 ( eq.([eq20 ] ) ) .",
    "it confirms , however , the evidence for intermediate mean - field csnq behavior .",
    "in addition the doping dependence of @xmath165 turns out to be a particular suitable property to discriminate between csnq and fluctuation dominated 3d - snq behavior .",
    "additional convincing evidence for a generic suppression of @xmath5 and @xmath78 in overdoped cuprates emerges from the @xmath19sr data displayed in fig.[fig7 ] for y@xmath3ca@xmath4ba@xmath166(cu@xmath167zn@xmath168)o@xmath169 ( y@xmath3ca@xmath4 - 123 ) , tl@xmath170pb@xmath171sr@xmath166ca@xmath172y@xmath1cu@xmath166o@xmath173(tl-1212 ) @xcite and tlba@xmath166cuo@xmath174 @xcite . to document the reduction of  @xmath175 as a function of the dopant concentration",
