    "in recent years precise experiments have provided detailed information regarding the parton structure of the nucleon .",
    "one of the more striking developments was the measurement of significant differences between up and down antiquark distributions in the nucleon sea .",
    "the first clear evidence for this was obtained from muon dis on deuterium by the nmc group @xcite , that enabled a precise determination of the gottfried sum rule @xcite .",
    "later this was more directly confirmed by drell - yan measurements in @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions @xcite and by semi - inclusive electroproduction at hermes @xcite . this sea quark flavor asymmetry , which had been anticipated @xcite on the basis of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry @xcite , has been incorporated into the latest phenomenological parton distributions @xcite .",
    "another approximate symmetry in parton distributions is charge symmetry , which involves rotation of @xmath3 about the two axis in isospin space , and which corresponds to interchange of protons and neutrons ( simultaneously interchanging up and down quarks ) .",
    "our faith in the charge symmetry of parton distributions is justified from experience in nuclear physics , where this symmetry is respected to a high degree of precision @xcite . until recently , the quantitative evidence which could be extracted from high energy experiments , although not particularly precise , was consistent with charge symmetric parton distributions @xcite . as a result",
    ", all phenomenological analyses of deep inelastic scattering data in terms of parton distribution functions assume charge symmetry .",
    "experimental verification of charge symmetry was difficult , first because high precision experiments were necessary to isolate charge symmetry violating ( csv ) effects , second because the best tests required comparison of electromagnetic and neutrino - induced reactions , and third because csv often mixes with quark flavor asymmetry effects .",
    "recent precise experiments have now significantly decreased the upper limits on parton csv contributions .",
    "the nmc measurements of muon dis on deuterium @xcite provide values for the charged lepton structure function @xmath4 . in a similar @xmath5 regime",

    ", ratios of these cross sections on isoscalar targets can provide an independent measurement of the weinberg angle , @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 extracted by the nutev group is three standard deviations larger than the measured fit to other electroweak processes @xcite .",
    "this striking result has led some people to suggest that they may be seeing evidence of physics beyond the standard model .    because of the importance of this result , it is crucial that all the effects contributing to this result be estimated to the best of our abilities .",
    "the nutev group has recently published a paper @xcite that estimates the contributions to their result from three sources : the excess of neutrons in their iron target ; the possible contribution from strange quarks and the effects of parton charge symmetry violation . as we will discuss in the following section , the isoscalar correction ( excess neutrons in iron ) makes a rather large , but apparently well - determined , correction to the extracted value of the weinberg angle . at present ,",
