    "a _ calabi  yau metric _ is a riemannian metric on a manifold @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 whose riemannian holonomy is precisely @xmath3 .. ] the representation theory of the holonomy group gives rise to various geometric structures on @xmath1 : there is a compatible complex structure ( unique up to complex conjugation when @xmath4 ) , a @xmath5-form @xmath6 which serves as the khler form of the given metric with respect to that complex structure , and a nowhere - vanishing holomorphic @xmath7-form @xmath8 .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath8 are covariantly constant ( as is the almost - complex structure operator @xmath9 ) .",
    "thanks to a result conjectured by calabi @xcite and proven by yau @xcite , when @xmath1 is a compact khler manifold with a nowhere - vanishing holomorphic @xmath7-form , there is a unique ricci - flat metric in each de rham cohomology class @xmath10\\in h^2(x,\\mathbb r)$ ] containing a khler form .",
    "these metrics have holonomy contained in @xmath3 , so they will be calabi ",
    "yau under our definition provided that the holonomy does not reduce to a subgroup . as a consequence , the existence of a nowhere - vanishing holomorphic @xmath7-form on a khler manifold @xmath1 is often taken as a definition of _ calabi ",
    "yau manifold_.    given a calabi ",
    "yau metric on @xmath1 , an associated khler form @xmath6 , and a holomorphic @xmath7-form @xmath8 , we say that a submanifold @xmath11 of ( real ) dimension @xmath7 is _ special lagrangian _",
    "if @xmath12 and @xmath13 for some @xmath14 called the _ phase _ of @xmath11 .",
    "this notion was introduced by harvey and lawson @xcite as a key example of a _ calibrated geometry _ : such submanifolds have a local volume - minimizing property .",
    "unfortunately , very few examples of special lagrangian submanifolds are known in the compact case .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact calabi ",
    "yau manifold .",
    "physical arguments predict that for most such @xmath1 , there should exist a mirror partner @xmath15 , which is another compact calabi ",
    "yau manifold whose physical ( but not geometrical ) properties are closely related to those of @xmath1 .",
    "however , as has been recognized since the early days of mirror symmetry @xcite , @xmath1 is expected to have a mirror partner only when the complex structure of @xmath1 is sufficiently close to a `` large complex structure limit point , '' which is a class of boundary points in the compactified moduli space @xmath16 characterized by having maximally unipotent monodromy @xcite .",
    "strominger , yau , and zaslow @xcite argued on physical grounds that any such calabi  yau manifold should have a map @xmath17 whose general fiber @xmath18 is a special langrangian @xmath7-torus @xmath19 ; such a structure is called a _",
    "supersymmetric torus fibration of @xmath1 _ , since the special lagrangian condition is the geometric counterpart to the preservation of half of the supersymmetry in a physical model .",
    "strominger , yau , and zaslow also proposed that the mirror partner should be given , to first approximation , by a compactification of the family of dual tori @xmath20 .",
    "it is worth saying a few words about the physical construction of the mirror partner .",
    "strominger , yau , and zaslow argue that the original calabi ",
    "yau manifold and its mirror partner should be related by a physical construction known as `` t - duality on the @xmath7-torus fibers . '' in the absence of holomorphic disks with boundaries on the @xmath7-tori , this t - duality simply replaces each nonsingular torus by its dual torus ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , while doing something unknown at the singular fibers .",
    "this description is expected to be modified when holomorphic disks are present , but the precise effect of the holomorphic disks has not yet been worked out . and as we shall see , the current expectation ( at least when @xmath21 ) is that such holomorphic disks will be present for at least some of the tori in the torus fibration .",
    "this has made it difficult to formulate a mathematical version of the original strominger ",
    " zaslow proposal which is both precise and accurate .",
    "because the arguments used by strominger , yau , and zaslow implicitly assume that the calabi ",
    "yau metric is uniformly large , we put that hypothesis in the following version of their existence conjecture .    for any calabi ",
    "yau metric on a compact complex manifold @xmath1 of complex dimension @xmath7 whose complex structure is sufficiently close to a large complex structure limit point and whose khler class is sufficiently deep in the khler cone , there exists a supersymmetric torus fibration @xmath17 , where @xmath22 is a homology @xmath7-sphere .",
    "there is by now considerable indirect evidence in favor of this conjecture , including an explicit construction in a ( slightly degenerate ) limiting case @xcite , as well as two strategies ( @xcite and @xcite ) for constructing weak forms of these fibrations for a certain class of compact calabi ",
    "yau threefolds .",
    "however , it has become clear that proving this conjecture will require developing new techniques for studying special lagrangian submanifolds of a calabi ",
    "yau manifold . in spite of our lack of tools to prove the conjecture , though , many qualitative features of supersymmetric torus fibrations have been inferred in various ways , and this paper is devoted to explaining our best current ( conjectural ) understanding of those qualitative features .",
    "we introduce the following terminology and notation . given a supersymmetric torus fibration @xmath17 , we let @xmath23 be the set of _ singular points of fibers _ of @xmath24 , and let @xmath25 be the _ discriminant locus _ of the fibration .",
    "in low dimension , supersymmetric torus fibrations of compact calabi  yau manifolds are completely understood .    in the case of elliptic curves ( @xmath26 ) , any calabi  yau metric is flat and a special lagrangian @xmath27-torus is just a closed geodesic . as is well known ,",
    "if the homology class is fixed then there is a fibration of the elliptic curve over @xmath28 by closed geodesics in the specified class , with no singular fibers .    in the case of k3 surfaces ( @xmath29 ) ,",
    "an analysis is possible due to the non - uniqueness of the compatible complex structure .",
    "in fact , the original paper of harvey and lawson @xcite showed that if @xmath30 is special lagrangian , then there is a different complex structure on @xmath1 ( compatible with the given calabi ",
    "yau metric ) such that @xmath30 is a complex submanifold .",
    "thus , a special lagrangian @xmath31 fibration can be interpreted in another complex structure as a holomorphic elliptic fibration @xmath32 ( with base @xmath33 ) , and the structure of these is known in detail .",
    "( in fact , a generic ricci - flat metric on a k3 surface admits such a fibration @xcite , so the existence conjecture holds in this case . )",
    "thanks to work of kodaira @xcite , a complete classification of possible singular fibers of such fibrations is known : they are characterized by the conjugacy class of the monodromy action on @xmath34 .",
    "the simplest fibers , called _",
    "semistable _ , are associated to unipotent monodromy transformations . in an appropriate basis ,",
    "the monodromy matrix takes the form @xmath35    the topology of a semistable degeneration with @xmath36 is very familiar .",
    "one of the cycles on the two - torus extends over the degeneration , and the other `` vanishing '' cycle shrinks to a point ; if we follow the torus around a loop encircling the degeneration point in the base , there is a dehn twist along the vanishing cycle . in spite of this twisting of the topology of the torus ,",
    "though , the total space of the fibration is non - singular .",
    "( in the physics literature , the corresponding geometry is known as the `` taub - nut metric . '' )    for the generic elliptic fibration of a k3 surface , all fibers are semistable , and there are exactly @xmath37 of them , each with @xmath36 .",
    "the monodromy data for such a generic fibration ( choosing an arbitrary base point @xmath38 ) gives a natural homomorphism @xmath39 whose generating loops all map to matrices conjugate to eq .  .",
    "the mirror partner of a given k3 surface ( with a fixed ricci - flat metric ) is known to be another k3 surface with a different ricci - flat metric @xcite . when passing to the mirror ,",
    "the monodromy matrices @xmath40 are replaced by @xmath41 ; since @xmath41 is conjugate to @xmath40 , the monodromy data does not change .",
    "we will conjecturally extend this kind of `` topological '' mirror symmetry statement to dimension @xmath42 in the next section .",
    "note that , in any dimension , if we replace all nonsingular tori by their dual tori , the monodromy matrices change as @xmath43 .",
    "the first step in studying supersymmetric @xmath0 fibrations of compact calabi ",
    "yau threefolds is to study more general @xmath0 fibrations , without imposing the `` special lagrangian '' condition . for calabi ",
    "yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties ( of arbitrary dimension ) , zharkov @xcite constructed a ( topological ) @xmath19 fibration .",
    "a general program to understand such fibrations @xmath32 ( in dimension @xmath42 ) for which the map @xmath24 is smooth ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) was initiated by gross @xcite , and parallel results were obtained by ruan @xcite in his study of a specific class of @xmath0 fibrations of calabi  yau hypersurfaces .",
    "the monodromy of such fibrations and the topology of the singular fibers was determined under a suitable assumption of genericity , analogous to the assumption of `` generic elliptic fibration '' in the case of k3 surfaces which guaranteed that all fibers were semistable with @xmath36 .",
    "we can summarize the analysis in a general conjecture ( which conjecturally extends their results to the general case ) .",

    "the topology near the edges of @xmath45 is modeled by the product of a cylinder with the @xmath36 semistable degeneration of two - tori . in particular ,",

    "* the vertices of @xmath45 come in two types : near a _ positive vertex _ , the three monodromy actions on @xmath46 near the vertex have fixed planes whose intersection is @xmath27-dimensional , while the three monodromy actions on @xmath47 have a common @xmath5-dimensional fixed plane . in an appropriate basis ,",
    "the monodromy matrices on @xmath47 take the form @xmath49 on the other hand , near a _ negative vertex _ , the three monodromy actions on @xmath46 near the vertex have a common @xmath5-dimensional fixed plane , while the three monodromy actions on @xmath47 have fixed planes whose intersection is @xmath27-dimensional .",

    "the fiber of @xmath24 over each positive vertex has euler characteristic @xmath27 , and the fiber over each negative vertex has euler characteristic @xmath53 .",
    "( in fact , gross @xcite and ruan @xcite gave explicit descriptions of these singular fibers , but we will not reproduce those descriptions here . )    there is an induced global monodromy action on @xmath47 @xmath54 whose generators satisfy the conditions spelled out in the conjecture .",
    "if we have a compact calabi  yau threefold and its mirror partner , with smooth @xmath0 fibrations whose nonsingular fibers are dual to each other , then the monodromy transformations will be related as @xmath55 .",

    "since part ( e ) of the conjecture implies that the topological euler number of @xmath1 can be calculated via @xmath56 the effect of mirror symmetry on monodromy then shows that the euler number changes sign : @xmath57 as expected from physical mirror symmetry arguments .        in @xcite",
    ", gross showed how to go further , and use the data from a generic smooth @xmath0 fibration of a given compact calabi ",
    "yau threefold to construct a manifold which is a candidate mirror partner .",
    "the transpose inverse of the original monodromy representation produces a mirror monodromy representation , describing the monodromy on the family of dual tori ( with positive and negative vertices reversed ) .",

    "for smooth @xmath0 fibrations of a compact calabi ",
    "yau threefold , the combinatorics of the graph @xmath45 are beautiful and intricate .",
    "for example , in the case of a quintic hypersurface in @xmath58 , the graph depends on choices of triangulations of the two - dimensional faces of the newton polytope of the defining equation ; one such choice is shown on the left side of figure  [ fig : triangulation ] .",
    "one constructs the dual graph of each such triangulation , in which each face of the triangulation gives a vertex of the graph , and each edge of the triangulation is crossed by an edge of the graph ( as shown on the right side of figure  [ fig : triangulation ] ) . that dual graph then becomes a piece of @xmath45 ( illustrated on the left side of figure  [ fig : graphpiece ] )",
    "in which each vertex is `` negative . ''",
    "the pieces are assembled according to the combinatorics of the newton polytope , in which the free ends of the dual graph meet free ends from other faces of the newton polytope , forming trivalent vertices which are the `` positive '' vertices of @xmath45 .",
    "the pieces thus attach three at a time ; a neighborhood of one such attachment is illustrated on the right side of figure  [ fig : graphpiece ]     for the quintic threefold.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the quintic threefold.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a general description of these graphs , for calabi ",
    "yau complete intersections in toric varieties , was given by haase and zharkov @xcite and by gross @xcite .",
    "their results show that the classes of mirror pairs described by batyrev @xcite and by batyrev and borisov @xcite admit smooth @xmath0 fibrations satisfying conjecture  [ con : topology ] , and that those @xmath0 fibrations are mirror duals of each other .    this theory of smooth @xmath0 fibrations of compact calabi ",
    "yau threefolds can also be related to some topological aspects of mirror symmetry which have played important rles in the physics literature @xcite .",
    "first , the construction of @xmath45 for a calabi ",
    "yau hypersurface @xmath1 in a toric fourfold depends on a choice of triangulation of the faces of the newton polytope , and this choice of triangulation is equivalent to a choice of large complex structure limit point in the moduli space @xcite .",
    "mirror symmetry ( as developed in the physics literature ) offers an alternate interpretation : each large complex structure limit point corresponds to a different birational model of the mirror partner , and the khler cones of the birational models fit together into a common space ( after complexification ) , mirroring the complex structure moduli space @xmath59 @xcite . in this interpretation ,",
    "the choice of birational model depends explicitly on a choice of triangulation of the newton polytope ( which describes the mirror toric fourfold in batyrev s construction @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest birational change  a `` flop''is realized by the simple change of triangulation illustrated in figure  [ fig : flop ] . as gross pointed out ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 4.5 ) , the corresponding change in dual graph ( also illustrated in the figure ) has the correct monodromy properties to be allowed as a new graph @xmath60 .",
    "one expects that by appropriately varying the complex structure and the khler metric , the connecting edge in the original graph will shrink to zero length , giving the @xmath61-valent vertex shown in the intermediate stage ; further variation then causes a new connecting edge to grow , changing the topology to that of @xmath60 .         the intermediate step illustrated in the middle of figure  [ fig : flop ]",
    "is a partial triangulation , which is expected to correspond to a `` conifold '' singularity on the mirror calabi ",
    "yau threefold .",
    "a second topological feature of mirror symmetry is the `` conifold transition '' @xcite in which that conifold singularity is resolved with a small blowup , rather than being smoothed with a change of complex structure .",
    "( the conifold singularity is on the mirror partner , but this transition can also be described on the original calabi  yau threefold @xcite . )",
    "the graph @xmath45 appears to change as follows , as proposed independently by gross @xcite and ruan @xcite : after shrinking the connecting edge to zero size , leaving a @xmath61-valent vertex , the two arms of the graph crossing at that vertex are separated into different planes , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : conifold ] . as gross and ruan verify , this change is compatible with the monodromies around the edges and produces the expected change in topological euler characteristic for a conifold transition .",
    "however , the relation between this construction and more global versions of the conifold transition remains mysterious and needs further study .",
    "local moduli for a compact special lagrangian submanifold @xmath11 of a compact calabi ",
    "yau manifold @xmath1 were determined by mclean @xcite : the deformation space is smooth , and its tangent space is canonically identified with the space of harmonic @xmath27-forms of @xmath11 .",
    "hitchin @xcite used this identification to construct two affine structures on @xmath62 ( if @xmath24 is smooth ) , which geometrize the monodromy transformations that occurred in conjecture  [ con : topology ] .",
    "if @xmath63 is a normal vector field to @xmath11 in @xmath1 , then the contraction @xmath64 of @xmath63 with the khler form gives a harmonic @xmath27-form on @xmath11 , and the contraction @xmath65 of @xmath63 with the holomorphic @xmath7-form gives a harmonic @xmath66-form on @xmath11 .",
    "these constructions give rise to the affine structures , which can be seen by considering periods of the harmonic forms .",

    "such coordinate systems provide an affine structure , that is , the transition functions between any two such coordinate systems lie in the affine group @xmath79 . intrinsically , the lattice @xmath80 should be identified with @xmath73 in this case , and this affine structure carries the information about the monodromy on @xmath73 .",

    "such coordinate systems provide the other affine structure , which carries the information about the monodromy on @xmath89 .",
    "hitchin shows that these two affine structures are related by a legendre transform with respect to a suitable locally defined function @xmath90 ( which also determines a canonical metric on the deformation space ) .",
    "this is a version of mirror symmetry which is formulated strictly on the base of the torus fibrations , a notion which was further developed in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath1 is a compact calabi ",
    "yau threefold , it is expected that the map @xmath24 giving a supersymmetric torus fibration @xmath91 will be only piecewise smooth , so the analysis of sections  [ sec : smooth ] and [ sec : affine ] does not directly apply .",
    "gross showed @xcite that if @xmath24 is smooth , the discriminant locus @xmath92 must have codimension two ; in the more general `` piecewise smooth '' case , @xmath93 may have codimension @xmath27 .",
    "however , we do expect that @xmath93 will always have a retraction onto a subset @xmath45 of codimension two .",
    "and there is a particular limiting situation in which this retraction should become evident : the large complex structure limit .    in fact , gross  wilson @xcite and kontsevich ",

    "the key technique of stitching together smooth @xmath0 fibrations along a common boundary had been developed in earlier work of these authors @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of castao - bernard and matessi s construction is the behavior of the discriminant locus @xmath93 .",
    "their fibrations have a discriminant locus which is a trivalent graph near the positive vertices , but has codimension @xmath27 near the negative vertices .",
    "the discriminant locus retracts onto a trivalent graph ; the inverse `` thickening '' of parts of this graph to a codimension @xmath27 set replaces each neighborhood of a negative vertex with an amoeba - like shape which retracts back to the graph .",
    "moreover , the fibration is smooth outside of a set which retracts to ( a subset of ) the graph .",
    "this result , when combined with the discussion in section  [ sec : amoebas ] , helps to motivate our conjectures in the next two sections .",
    "prior to joyce s analysis of the structure of special lagrangian fibrations @xcite , there had been speculation that supersymmetric @xmath0 fibrations of compact calabi ",
    "yau threefolds would always be smooth , so that the detailed structure ( in the generic case ) would be the one given in conjecture  [ con : topology ] .",
    "however , joyce s analysis prompted many of us to rethink the question , and to try to formulate properties analogous to those of conjecture  [ con : topology ] which we would expect supersymmetric @xmath0 fibrations to have .",
    "once such formulation appears in conjecture  [ con : geometry ] below .",
    "in conjecture  [ con : topology ] , the discriminant locus is a graph @xmath45 , but in general we should expect a discriminant locus @xmath93 which only retracts to a graph @xmath45 . as joyce pointed out ( and was already mentioned in conjecture  [ con : joyce ] ) , the first thing to expect is that the edges of the graph @xmath45 should thicken to ribbons ; moreover , one should see two singular points in each fiber over an interior point of the ribbon , with the two points coming together to a single singular point along the edges of the ribbon .",
    "the next thing to expect was also proposed by joyce @xcite : since at a `` negative '' vertex , the local monodromy transformations share a common @xmath5-dimensional fixed plane , @xmath93 should remain planar , and the negative vertex should be replaced by a `` trivalent ribbon '' of the sort illustrated in figure  [ fig : negvertex ] .",
    "( this is the same structure found by castao - bernard and matessi @xcite in the lagrangian case . )",
    "near a `` positive '' vertex , the three planes containing parts of @xmath93 share a common line but are distinct ; joyce also made a specific proposal for the structure in this case , but we will make a slightly different proposal in our main conjecture below .    another motivation for our conjecture is the observation by ruan that in his construction ( and also in zharkov s construction ) , the discriminant locus is built out of amoebas , in fact , out of amoebas with the maximum number of holes . since such amoebas arise from moment maps which are @xmath5-to-@xmath27 over the interior and @xmath27-to-@xmath27 over the edges , it is natural to identify the set of singular points of @xmath24 with the algebraic curve whose moment map image is the amoeba .",
    "this is what we do in our main conjecture .",
    "a third input to our conjecture is the harvey ",
    "lawson fibration of @xmath122 , which is the standard model of a `` positive '' vertex with a lagrangian structure . in that fibration ,",
    "the set of singular points consists of the coordinate axes in @xmath122 , which meet in a `` transverse triple point . ''",

    "* for each connected component @xmath214 of @xmath209 , @xmath215 is contained in a ( real ) surface @xmath216 , and the map @xmath217 is generically @xmath5-to-@xmath27 onto its image @xmath215 , which has the topology of a compactified amoeba with @xmath218 holes .",

    "the positive vertices of the graph @xmath45 are the points in @xmath93 at which the spines of the various compactified amoebas meet .",
    "the map @xmath24 puts the singular points of @xmath209 in one - to - one correspondence with the positive vertices * the set @xmath219 of fibers which are either singular or contain the boundary of at least one holomorphic disk retracts onto the discriminant locus @xmath93 .",
    "( although in the local example illustrated in figure  [ fig : thickribbon ] the set @xmath174 extended far away from @xmath93 , we expect that in global examples @xmath174 will be confined to a small neighborhood of @xmath93 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : cylinder ] . )",
    "the map @xmath24 is smooth to be smooth on the larger set @xmath220 . ] when restricted to @xmath221 .",
    "we have been deliberately vague about the notion of a topological amoeba and its spine , since we do nt know how much of the theory of amoebas should be expected to go through .",
    "it would be very interesting to know , for example , if some version of the ronkin function can be defined for a supersymmetric @xmath0 fibration .",
    "note that one of the things which could happen if we attempt to deform this structure too far away from a large complex structure limit point is that @xmath217 might stop being generically @xmath5-to-@xmath27 , as happens for moment maps of algebraic curves .",
    "it would be very interesting to see what happens to supersymmetric @xmath0 fibrations in that case . presumably , something more general than joyce s phenomenon of two singular points per fiber is going on here ( as joyce briefly discusses in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.2 ) ) .        among the consequences of our conjecture is a specific prediction for the structure of @xmath93 near a positive vertex .",
    "using local affine coordinates to identify a neighborhood of the vertex with the first cohomology of the fiber , the three local pieces of @xmath93 must be contained in the three monodromy - invariant @xmath5-planes , which meet along a common line but are distinct .",
    "however , because the corresponding singular point of @xmath209 is a transverse triple point , the thickening of each piece of the discriminant locus will need to `` thin down '' near the positive vertex so that the three pieces of @xmath93 meet in a single point , leading to a description of the discriminant locus similar to that illustrated in figure  [ fig : tripledisc ] .",
    "( this `` thinning down '' was absent from joyce s proposal about the positive vertices . )",
    "notice that , as joyce observed , the discriminant locus has a markedly different local structure near positive and negative vertices and therefore we can not hope for a mirror symmetry statement which simply dualizes all nonsingular tori in the fibration .",
    "the conjecture that @xmath24 is smooth on a region whose complement retracts to @xmath93 was motivated in part by the properties of the construction of castao - bernard and matessi @xcite . the conjecture that @xmath222 provides such a region",
    "is motivated in part by joyce s observation that  at least in examples  the boundary between the set of tori bounding holomorphic disks and the set not bounding holomorphic disks is a boundary along which @xmath24 fails to be smooth . an additional motivation for part ( f ) of the conjecture is the hope that a proper understanding of the disk contributions to the physical `` t - duality '' construction will restore the symmetry between the @xmath0 fibrations on the original calabi  yau manifold and its mirror partner : the fibrations would consist of dual tori on the complement of @xmath222 ( where hitchin s legendre transform will relate the affine structures ) , with the duality between the tori somehow modified within @xmath222 by the disk contributions .",
    "we close with a final conjecture , which is perhaps less well - motivated than conjecture  [ con : geometry ] , but which proposes an explanation for why the structures we expect from supersymmetric @xmath0 fibrations are related to the complex structure being near a large complex structure limit point ( as the physics suggests ) .",
    "this final conjecture also points the way towards a connection between our conjectures and the interesting program of gross and siebert @xcite , which formulates mirror symmetry in terms of degenerations of algebraic varieties .",
