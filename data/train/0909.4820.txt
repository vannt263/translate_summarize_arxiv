    "over the last two decades , the study of hamiltonian lattice systems , as well as of continuum models with periodic potentials has been a subject of increasing interest @xcite .",
    "these systems arise in a diverse host of physical contexts , describing , e.g. , the spatial dynamics of optical beams in coupled waveguide arrays or photorefractive crystals or optically induced photonic lattices in nonlinear optics @xcite , the temporal evolution of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices in soft - condensed matter physics @xcite , or the dna double strand in biophysics @xcite , among many others .",
    "one of the main thrusts of work in these directions has been centered around the investigation of existence and stability of localized solitary wave solutions . in two dimensions ,",
    "such structures can be discrete solitons @xcite or discrete vortices ( i.e. , structures that have topological charge over a discrete contour ) @xcite .",
    "optically - induced photonic lattices in photorefractive crystals such as strontium barium niobate ( sbn ) have been used as an ideal platform for the observation of those predicted soliton structures .",
    "indeed , the theoretical proposal @xcite of such lattice solitons was followed quickly by their experimental realization in 2d induced lattices @xcite , subsequently leading to the observation of a host of novel solitons in this setting , including dipole @xcite , multipole @xcite , necklace @xcite , and rotary @xcite solitons as well as discrete @xcite and gap @xcite vortices .",
    "in addition to lattice solitons , photonic lattices have enabled observations of other intriguing phenomena such as higher order bloch modes @xcite , zener tunneling @xcite , and localized modes in honeycomb @xcite , hexagonal @xcite and quasi - crystalline @xcite lattices , and anderson localization @xcite ( see , e.g. , the recent review @xcite for additional examples ) . in parallel ,",
    "experimental development in the area of becs closely follows , with prominent recent results including the observation of bright , dark and gap solitons in quasi - one - dimensional settings @xcite , with the generation of similar structures in higher dimensions being experimentally feasible for becs trapped in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "earlier experimental work on discrete vortex solitons @xcite has mainly focused on vortices of unit topological charge ( i.e. , @xmath1 , with a 2@xmath2 phase shift circle around a discrete contour ) .",
    "however , more recently both in optics @xcite and in bec @xcite ( so far in the absence of the lattice for the latter case ) , the study of higher charge vortices has been of interest . in particular , in the emerging area of hexagonal @xcite and honeycomb @xcite lattices , it has been predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite very recently that a higher - order vortex with topological charge @xmath0 is _ more _ stable than a fundamental vortex with unit charge ( @xmath1 ) when self - trapped with a focusing nonlinearity .",
    "the prototypical nonlinear dynamical lattice associated with the above systems is the so - called discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) @xcite . in the context of that model",
    ", it has been predicted that genuine @xmath0 vortices turn out to be unstable in the case of a square lattice @xcite .",
    "this instability , however , can be avoided as proposed in two separate ways : a more intrusive one in which the central site of the contour is eliminated , introducing a defect therein @xcite , as well as a less intrusive one involving the configuration of @xmath0 vortex on a `` rhomboidal '' contour as 8-site excitation in the square lattices , proposed solely on the basis of numerical observation as in @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to understand from a theoretical perspective the _ geometric stabilization _ ( as we will call it ) of @xmath0 vortices , and to illustrate its generic nature in discrete systems , by considering the case of optically induced photonic lattices with a photorefractive nonlinearity ( where there are some special intricacies of the theoretical analysis that we also illustrate ) .",
    "based on our theoretical analysis of the discrete model , we then consider a more realistic continuum model of beam propagation with a periodic potential , illustrating that the @xmath0 vortices geometrically extended to eight sites can indeed be linearly stable even in the continuum model . finally , we corroborate these theoretical and numerical analyses with direct experimental observation of self - trapped @xmath0 vortices whose topological charges are sustained during propagation throughout the nonlinear medium , which can be clearly contradistinguished from prior observations of breakup or charge - flipping of such high - order vortices [ 28 ] .",
    "the structure of our presentation is as follows . in section",
    "ii we examine the model of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger type with both kerr and saturable nonlinearities , where our analytical findings are compared with numerical bifurcation results . in section",
    "iii we consider the continuum model of beam propagation in photorefractive media with a periodic potential relevant to our experiment for the focusing and briefly also for the defocusing case . in section",
    "iv we present our experimental results .",
    "section v concludes the paper with a number of interesting directions proposed for future studies .",
    "the dnls with both kerr and saturable nonlinearities can be written as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 for the typical dnls with kerr nonlinearity , while @xmath5 in the saturable one ( notice that both models share the same small amplitude limit ) . in the above",
    ", the overdot denotes the derivative with respect to the evolution variable , while @xmath6 stands for the discrete laplacian .",
    "we seek sationary solutions of the form @xmath7 [ notice that we denote the evolution variable as @xmath8 , although in optics it represents the propagation distance @xmath9 , obtaining the steady state equation : @xmath10 v_{m , n}=0 .",
    "\\label{sta_eq}\\ ] ]    our considerations will start at the so - called anti - continuum ( ac ) limit of @xmath11 , where it is straightforward to solve the steady state equations for a given @xmath12 . in the dnls case ,",
    "each site can be @xmath13 or @xmath14 and in the saturable case , we have @xmath15 or @xmath14 . in order to consider cases where the solutions have the same amplitude between our two examples",
    ", we will select , without loss of generality @xmath16 for the dnls case , while @xmath17 for the saturable one .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that in the ac limit , solutions can be obtained with arbitrary phase profiles .",
    "however , out of all the possible profiles , it is relevant to examine which ones may survive for @xmath18 . to do so , we expand the solution into a power series e.g. , @xmath19 , and write down the solution of the system order by order . to leading order the relevant equation for @xmath20 will yield    [ discrete_lin2 ] ( v_0,=0 ) - = 0 .    where @xmath21 is the jacobian of eqs .",
    "( [ sta_eq ] ) [ with respect to the variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 evaluated at the solution for @xmath11 :    @xmath24    for each of the excited sites ( indicated by @xmath25 ) there corresponds a zero eigenvalue of the jacobian with an eigenvector which vanishes away from the @xmath25-th block .",
    "projecting to this eigenvector , as explained in @xcite yields the lyapunov - schmidt conditions for the persistence of the solution .",
    "first , let us clarify the notation we will use in this paper .",
    "when the principal axes of a square lattice are normally oriented in horizontal and vertical directions , we name the structure a _ square vortex _ when it excites horizontal and vertical ( nearest - neighbor ) sites within a square contour , and likewise , a _ rhomboidal vortex _ when it excites diagonal ( next - nearest - neighbor ) sites in a rhomboidal contour ( see fig .",
    "[ bfig1 ] ) .",
    "we shall stick to such notation later for the continuum model even when the principal axes are diagonally oriented , as typically used in experiments with induced lattices @xcite .",
    "for the case of the @xmath0 square vortex , different conditions have been analyzed in @xcite and will not be presented here .",
    "instead , we present here the case of the geometrically stabilized @xmath0 rhomboidal vortex . in the latter case , if we denote the vortex by indices @xmath26 , starting from the top of the rhombus , then it is straightforward to see that the fundamental difference between the square and rhomboidal settings is that _ all _ interactions between adjacent sites in the rhombus are _ next nearest neighbor _ ones , and hence they come in not at the leading order in perturbative corrections ( i.e. , at o@xmath27 ) , but rather at o@xmath28 , having the following form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , with periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. , site @xmath31 corresponds to site @xmath32 , site @xmath33 to site @xmath34 etc . ) .",
    "both in the dnls , as well as in the saturable lattice case , the @xmath0 solution with @xmath35 among adjacent sites ( so that an accumulation of phase of @xmath36 occurs around the discrete contour for these extended 8-site vortices ) naturally satisfies the above persistence conditions .    however , the more crucial question is that of stability of the pertinent solutions . as initially illustrated in @xcite , perhaps not surprisingly , the matrix that bears the relevant information is the _",

    "the solid lines show the full numerical results for the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues @xmath41 as a function of the coupling constant @xmath40 , while the two dashed lines ( the lowest one of which is indistinguishable from the corresponding solid line ) show the explicit analytical predictions in the text , which are in very good agreement with the corresponding numerics.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=226 ] ) of the geometrically stabilized rhomboidal @xmath0 vortex obtained from dnls with kerr ( cubic ) nonlinearity ( top left is the real part , top right is its imaginary part , bottom left shows the amplitude and bottom right the phase distribution ) .",

    "( [ eqn1 ] ) is then determined from the eigenvalue problem : @xmath42 and @xmath43 is @xmath44 note that this system can equivalently be rearranged into @xmath45-by-@xmath45 block formation .",
    "the discrete vortex is called spectrally unstable if there exist @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the problem ( [ eigenvalue ] ) , such that @xmath48 . otherwise , the discrete vortex is called spectrally stable .",
    "it is straightforward to observe that in the limit of @xmath11 , only the excited sites yield a set of @xmath49 ( i.e. , as many as the number of such sites ) pairs of null eigenvalues , while the non - excited sites yield eigenvalues with @xmath50 ( which will `` become '' the continuous spectrum of the problem ) ; in the saturable case , this part of the spectrum is at @xmath51 . out of these @xmath49 vanishing eigenvalue pairs in the ac limit ,",
    "only one can be sustained at the origin for @xmath52 , due to the preserved phase invariance of the solution , while the remaining ones have to move off of the origin , as dictated by eq .",
    "( [ eigs ] ) .",
    "interestingly , in the case of the unstable square contour vortex , the phase change of @xmath53 across sites renders zero all elements of the corresponding tridiagonal ( in that case ) jacobian of the persistence conditions which , there , read @xmath54 .",
    "this is the so - called `` super - symmetric '' case of @xcite which needs to be treated at a higher order and , as a result , leads to higher order eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "these studies illustrated that in addition to a pair at @xmath31 and another pair of higher order , there is a quadruple pair @xmath55 , a single pair @xmath56 and a _ real _ pair ( responsible for the instability ) @xmath57 .",
    "the investigation of these works illustrated that this real pair was due to the interaction between the 4 sites adjacent to the central one of the vortex ( to 2nd order , as mediated by the central site of the vortex ) .",
    "that is why the defect - induced stabilization worked in @xcite via its exclusion of this type of interactions",
    ".    however , stabilization also ensues , in a geometric fashion , in the case of the rhomboidal @xmath0 pattern .",
    "what happens in this case is that indeed the odd sites of the vortex still interact between them through the central site , however , now this interaction is geometrically `` screened '' by their lower order interaction with the even - numbered sites within the contour . as a result",
    "the instability is no longer mediated .",
    "more specifically , the analytical calculation in the case of the dnls yields an @xmath58 jacobian , which for @xmath59 has 4 zero eigenvalues ( which will become nonzero at a higher order ) , while the remaining 4 eigenvalues satisfy @xmath60 yielding , in addition to the phase - invariance induced persistent zero pair , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . because the interaction arises due to 2nd order neighbors , as shown in @xcite , the relevant contribution is @xmath63 , yielding a double pair @xmath64 and a single pair @xmath65 , in excellent agreement with the numerical results , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bfig1 ] ( especially , the @xmath66 prediction can not be distinguished from its numerical counterpart ) .",
    "notice that , additionally to the above o@xmath27 eigenvalue pairs , there are also five pairs of smaller eigenvalues , a double and two single ones , as well as one at @xmath31 , due to the persistence of the gauge symmetry .    in the saturable case",
    ", we also observe numerically the same geometric stabilization effect , as is illustrated by the corresponding eigenvalues , for this case , of fig .",
    "[ bfig2 ] .",
    "however , here there is an interesting theoretical feature that is worth discussing . in the recent exposition of the saturable case in @xcite ,",
    "it was illustrated for nearest neighbor contours that the formula associating the eigenvalues of the full problem with those of the reduced jacobian is : @xmath67 , due to the differences in the corresponding linearization operators .",
    "however , we observed numerically in the present ( _ next - nearest - neighbor _ ) setting that this formula no longer holds .",
    "in particular , it is found that the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ bfig2 ] , which optimally match the numerical findings for small @xmath40 , are given by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , namely they are less than their cubic counterparts by a factor of @xmath70 ( rather than a factor of @xmath45 , as per the relation of @xcite ) .",
    "retracing step - by - step , the derivation of section 5 of @xcite , one can indeed theoretically identify this nontrivial difference , when repeating the relevant calculation for the saturable case .",
    "in particular , it is true ( we have checked that this does hold true for saturable nonlinearities also in 1d next - nearest - neighbor contours ) that generally for saturable nonlinearities but _ next - nearest - neighbor _ contours , the small eigenvalues of the full problem are given by : @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the next - nearest - neighbor jacobian . in the cubic case , the corresponding formula ( cf . ( 5.15 ) of @xcite ) has an extra factor of @xmath45 in the right hand side .",

    "[ fig6](a ) ] , while the vortex core is overlapping with the central non - excited site .",
    "this arrangement corresponds to the square vortex configuration ( abcdefg ) illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cont_1 ] .",
    "the phase singularity of the input vortex is identified from two different interferograms shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6](b , c ) ( zoomed in so as to see the fringes more clearly ) . two - fork fringes [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ] and two - start spirals [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ] in the central region of the interferograms clearly show the s=2 phase dislocations .",
    "as expected , the @xmath0 vortex breaks up into two s=1 vortices during linear propagation through the homogenous medium ( i.e. , without the waveguide lattice ) , as shown in fig . [ fig6](d ) .",
    "this is the natural outcome of the topological instability @xcite .",
    "when a dc field is applied along the crystalline c - axis , the sbn crystal turns into a self - focusing medium @xcite . under a proper strength of the nonlinearity",
    ", the vortex beam evolves into a @xmath0 vortex soliton .",
    "typical results are shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , for which the lattice period is about @xmath130 m and the vortex - to - lattice intensity ratio of the beams is about @xmath131 . at a low bias field of @xmath132v / cm ,",
    "the output vortex exhibits typical discrete diffraction covering many lattice sites [ fig . [ fig6](e ) ] .",
    "however , when the bias field is increased to about @xmath133kv / cm , the vortex beam self - traps into a @xmath0 vortex soliton , covering mainly the eight sites excited at the input [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](f ) ] .",
    "in order to identify the phase structure of the nonlinear localized state , a tilted broad beam ( akin to a quasi - plane wave ) is sent to interfere with the vortex soliton at the output .",
    "it can be seen clearly [ fig . [ fig6](g ) ] that the two forks remain in the center , and their bifurcation directions remain also unchanged as compared with the input vortex beam [ fig . [ fig6](b ) ] .",
    "this provides a direct evidence for the formation of @xmath0 high - order discrete vortex solitons with preserving phase singularities .",
    "we emphasize that such solitons are generated under the 8-site excitation , as predicted in theory , and they are quite different from the 4-site excitation which leads to dynamical charge flipping or disintegration of the topological charge , as observed in our previous experiment @xcite . without the lattice ,",
    "the @xmath0 vortex becomes unstable and breaks up into soliton filaments due to azimuthal modulation instability under the same bias conditions [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](h ) ] .",
    "this indicates that , in an optically induced square lattice , the s=2 vortex can be geometrically stabilized and self - trapped , in good agreement with above theoretical and numerical results .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows our experimental results on self - trapping of extended s=2 vortex in the photonic square lattices induced with a self - defocusing nonlinearity .",
    "notice that the location of the vortex ring [ illustrated by the blue circle in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) ] is different from that in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) in order to have the extended 8-site excitation , now that the waveguides are located at the intensity minima ( rather than maxima ) of the lattice - inducing beam under self - defocusing nonlinearity @xcite . in comparison with very recent study of s=2 discrete vortex solitons in hexagonal photonic lattices @xcite , we found that the s=2 vortex can remain self - trapped [ fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) ] and maintain its singularities [ fig .",
    "[ fig7](d ) ] also under the self - defocusing nonlinearity .",
    "in addition , differently from the more localized 4-site excitation of the s=2 vortex which evolves into a self - trapped quadrupole - like structure @xcite , here the vortex phase structure remains .",
    "furthermore , the fourier - space spectrum [ fig . [ fig7](e ) ] does not concentrate near the four m - points of the first broullion zone , confirming the above numerical finding that the complex mode structures of such high - order vortex solitons do not bifurcate from the edge of the bloch band .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the geometric stabilization of s=2 vortices through the presence of next - nearest neighbor interactions in 2d square lattices .",
    "different orientations for multi - site excitation of the vortices were studied and compared with previous work where the geometric stabilization is absent and nearest - neighbor interactions mediated through the central site leading to instability . based on the results obtained from the standard cubic nonlinear schrdinger lattice model",
    ", we extended our study to the case of the discrete model with a saturable nonlinearity , revealing some subtleties with respect to next - nearest neighbor eigenvalue calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the principal analytical and numerical observations persisted therein .",
    "these findings were further studied by computations in the full continuum model , and we found that both the square and rhomboidal orientations of the extended vortex can lead to stable s=2 vortex solitons under appropriate conditions .",
    "lastly , we corroborated these analytical and numerical results with experimental observations in optically induced photonic lattices . in a 10 mm long photorefractive crystal",
    ", we demonstrated that a double - charge vortex can maintain its singularity during nonlinear propagation in square lattices under both self - focusing and -defocusing nonlinearities .",
    "it would be interesting to experimentally study the dynamics of higher charge vortices , such as vortices of topological charge @xmath134 , for which the discrete model theory predicts potential stability , as well as to consider using crystals with longer propagation distances such that some of the above - predicted instability phenomena could be observable .",
    "on the other hand , from a theoretical perspective , a detailed understanding of vortices in more complex lattice settings such as superlattices and quasi - crystalline lattices could be important for relevant studies in other nonlinear systems involving vortices and periodic potentials .",
