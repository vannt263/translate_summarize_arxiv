    "physical observables must be extracted from the theory in a gauge - invariant manner , which ensures that the background vector space does not play an active role in the theory .",

    "an accurate treatment of small scale effects requires a phase - space description of the photons , and the solution of the boltzmann equation describing the evolution of the distribution function .",

    "this is certainly true , however it is not problematic for the calculation of cmb anisotropies , since it is never claimed that the expansion of the photon distribution function truncates . instead , the series is truncated ( with suitable care to avoid reflection of power ) after a finite number of terms for numerical convenience ( see , for example , ma and bertshinger  @xcite ) .",
    "the truncation is chosen to be high enough up the series that it has negligible effect on the @xmath194 for the range of @xmath188 of interest .      over the epoch of interest here ,",
    "the baryons and electrons are non - relativistic , and we assume that they may be described as an ideal fluid , with energy density @xmath195 ( measured in the rest frame of the baryons ) , pressure @xmath196 , and covariant - velocity @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is a first - order quantity .",

    "note that equation   implies that there is no energy exchange between the radiation and the baryon plasma in the frame in which the baryon plasma is at rest , while equation   shows that there is momentum exchange due to dipole anisotropy of the cmb in the frame of the plasma .",
    "this behaviour is to be expected since we have assumed that the baryon - photon interaction approximates to thomson scattering in the baryon rest frame , for which there will be no energy transfer , but there will be momentum transfer if the photon distribution function is not isotropic .",
    "we will only consider cold dark matter ( cdm ) here , which may be described as a pressureless ideal fluid .",
    "hot dark matter ( hdm ) would require a distribution function description which for massive particles greatly increases the numerical complexity of the problem .",
    "( both cdm and hdm are considered , for example , in the gauge - dependent treatment in ma and bertshinger  @xcite ) .",
    "the cdm has energy density @xmath204 in its rest frame , which has covariant velocity @xmath205 , with @xmath206 a first - order quantity .",
    "the cdm interacts with other species through gravity alone , so the equations of motion are @xmath207 it is very convenient to use the cdm velocity to define the fundamental velocity @xmath89 ( @xmath208 ) . since the cdm is pressureless , it moves geodesically so that the acceleration @xmath209 will vanish for this choice of @xmath89 .",

    "the equations are both covariant and gauge - invariant ( in the sense of being independent of any map between the lumpy universe and the frw model ) .",
    "gauge - invariance ensures that the gauge - problems that have plagued other approaches are not present , while covariance ensures that we are working with quantities which are straightforward to interpret physically .",
    "the equations describe scalar , vector and tensor perturbations in a unified manner , and are independent of any harmonic analysis into spatial modes .",
    "furthermore , we have not had to specify the background frw model yet ( there is an implicit assumption that the universe is approximately frw when the first - order , covariant variables are constructed ) .      in this section",
    "we reduce the general equations of the previous section to a set of equations for scalar - valued , first - order gauge - invariant variables describing the evolution of the density inhomogeneities and the cmb anisotropy for scalar perturbations in a universe which is approximately a @xmath1 frw model .",
    "these equations thus describe the standard cdm model in a covariant and gauge - invariant manner .",
    "the equations split into a set of algebraic relations ( from the constraint equations ) and propagation equations for scalar variables .",

    "scalar perturbations may be characterised in a covariant manner by demanding that the magnetic part of the weyl tensor and the vorticity both vanish identically .",
    "the vanishing of the vorticity ensures that @xmath89 is a hypersurface orthogonal vector field .",
    "the perturbation equations place strong restrictions on the remaining non - zero variables , which may be satisfied by constructing the vector and tensor variables from spatial derivatives of the scalar ( harmonic ) eigenfunctions @xmath239 of the generalised helmholtz equation : @xmath240 which are constructed to satisfy @xmath241 from the @xmath239 we form a scalar valued tensor @xmath242 : @xmath243 which has the properties @xmath244 we then define scalar - valued tensors @xmath245 by the recursion formula ( for @xmath246 ) @xmath247 these tensors satisfy the properties @xmath248 which are readily proved by induction .",

    "the definitions above are independent of the spatial curvature @xmath251 of the background model",
    ". however , the differential properties of the @xmath252 are dependent on the value of @xmath251 .",
    "some of these properties are listed in the appendix to bruni  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite  the only new result we require is @xmath253 which is valid for @xmath1 only .",

    "the procedure we have adopted here , of expanding the angular dependence of the distribution function in symmetric , traceless , covariant spatial tensors , which are then expanded in the appropriate harmonic tensors , derived from the scalar harmonics , should be compared to the usual approach of fourier expanding ( for @xmath1 ) all variables , and then performing a legendre expansion of the angular dependence of the distribution function modes about the wavevector @xmath256 .",
    "although ultimately equivalent , the approach taken here has the advantage that it goes over unchanged to the case of tensor perturbations ( although it is now @xmath257 which satisfies the generalised helmholtz equation ) . for later convenience , we expand the angular moments of the distribution function in the form @xmath258 it is now a simple matter to substitute the harmonic expansions of the covariant variables into the general equations of section  [ sec_gen ] ( with @xmath133 and @xmath259 set to zero ) , to obtain equations for the scalar expansion coefficients .",
    "we assume that the variations in baryon pressure @xmath196 due to entropy variations are insignificant compared to those due to variations in @xmath195 .",

    "these gauge - invariant equations should be compared to the ( gauge - dependent ) equations used in most calculations of the cmb anisotropy ( see , for example ma and bertshinger  @xcite ) .",
    "note that the equations for @xmath270 and @xmath271 for @xmath181 are equivalent to those usually found in the literature since the moments of the distribution function in such gauge - dependent calculations are actually gauge - invariant for @xmath181 .",
    "the equations of the previous section may be solved numerically for appropriate initial conditions  @xcite to give the @xmath270 at the present epoch .",
    "these moments fully describe the cmb temperature anisotropy .",

    "we now have all the ingredients needed to calculate the cmb anisotropy for scalar perturbations in a flat cdm model , for given initial conditions .",
    "the numerical calculation of the anisotropy for such a model are underway , and the results will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .",

    "the dominant contributions to the anisotropy may be extracted analytically without recourse to a full numerical treatment . in this section ,",
    "we show how this can be done within the framework developed above .",

    "equation   is correct to first - order .",

    "our final topic is a review of the results of some recent calculations by pen , seljak and turok  @xcite of the power spectra in global defect theories . unlike the calculation of cmb anisotropies in inflationary models ,",
    "the calculation for defect theories has been plagued by computational difficulties .",
    "these difficulties arise from the continual generation of perturbations by the causal source ( the defects ) .",
    "one must solve for the non - linear evolution of the source , as well as the linearised response of the einstein / fluid / boltzmann equations to the causal sources .",

    "the vector modes dominate the total signal for @xmath322 , at which point they are suppressed by the horizon size at recombination .",
    "vector modes are insignificant in inflationary models since the vorticity decays as the universe expands to conserve angular momentum . however , in defect theories , the defects are a continual source of vorticity giving rise to a significant vector component to the cmb power spectrum . in addition , the continual ( causal ) sourcing of the fluid perturbations leads to decoherence , where scalar modes of a given scale ( inside the sound horizon ) oscillate with different phases in different parts of the universe , compared to the coherent oscillations which occur in inflationary models .",
    "this decoherence manifests itself as the suppression of the secondary doppler peaks in figure  [ fig_defs_1 ] .",
    "the significant contribution of the vector modes to the large scale power in the cmb spectrum leads to a suppression in the total signal for @xmath323 compared to inflationary models , when both are normalised at large angular scales . in figure  [ fig_defs_2 ]",
    "we show a comparison of the predictions of global defect theories , with cobe normalisation at @xmath324 , to the current generation of cmb measurements . the effect of vector modes and decoherence is to leave the predictions of the defect models systematically below the current degree - scale data .",

    "the defect calculations and the scdm calculations are normalised to cobe , and are compared with the matter power spectrum inferred from the galaxy distribution .",
    "the large contribution of vector modes to the cmb power spectrum in the range of the cobe normalisation , suppresses the scalar component compared to scdm .",
    "the cobe normalised defect models predict too little power in the matter spectrum on larger scales , and too much power on smaller scales .",
    "as is well known , the scdm model fares much better on large scales , but also predicts too much small scale power .

    "the significant contribution to large scale power from vector modes , which occurs in all defect models , leads to systematically low ( cobe normalised ) predictions for degree - scale cmb observations , and for the matter power spectrum .",

    "<S> our second topic is a discussion of covariant kinetic theory methods for the gauge - invariant calculation of primordial cmb anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> we present a covariant version of the boltzmann equation , which we use to derive a set of covariant equations for the gauge - invariant variables in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , which are independent of the background curvature and type of perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> equations describing a particular type of perturbation are obtained readily from this set , as we demonstrate for scalar perturbations in a @xmath1 universe . by integrating the covariant boltzmann equations along the line of sight , and using the instantaneous recombination approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an expression for the large scale anisotropy which agrees with an expression derived recently by dunsby . finally , we discuss some recent accurate calculations of the cmb anisotropy in global defect models . in such models , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of vorticity generation by the causal sources proves to be significant , leading to a suppression of acoustic peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that global defect models of structure formation may already be at variance with the growing volume of cmb ( and large scale structure ) data .    * recent developments in the calculation of + cmb anisotropies *     + _ mrao , cavendish laboratory , madingley road , _ + _ cambridge cb3 0he , uk . _ + </S>"
