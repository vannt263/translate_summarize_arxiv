    "these results are not very surprising as a high molecular hydrogen column density would imply the presence of large amounts of dust , which would obscure the background quasar at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths , making it very hard to even determine the quasar redshift , let alone detect absorption features in the spectrum .",
    "surveys for molecular absorption must hence be carried out at radio wavelengths , to ensure no bias against dusty sightlines .",
    "an unbiased radio absorption survey would provide a census of molecular absorbers as a function of redshift , allowing one to study the evolution of the cosmological mass density in molecular gas , as has been possible for atomic gas through optical surveys for dlas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . unfortunately",
    ", the narrow fractional bandwidth hitherto accessible to radio spectrometers has made it difficult to carry out such surveys for molecular absorption . as a result",
    ", only five radio molecular absorbers are currently known at cosmological distances , all at @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "the @xmath23 towards pks1830@xmath2421 remains the only molecular absorber found via a blind search @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we report the first large `` blind '' survey for redshifted molecular absorption , using the wide - bandwidth capabilities of the autocorrelation spectrometer ( acs ) on the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "the redshift sensitivity of an absorption survey is quantified by the redshift path density @xmath25 , defined so that @xmath26 gives the number of sightlines for which optical depths above the threshold sensitivity would have been detected in the interval @xmath14 to @xmath27 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the total survey redshift path is given by @xmath28 , essentially the sum over the redshift ranges for each target over which the survey is capable of detecting absorption .",
    "the primary goal in an absorption survey is to maximize @xmath29 for detectable absorption , at a given sensitivity to column density or optical depth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a radio molecular absorption survey is best done using the strong rotational lines of co ( at @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , ...  ghz ) , and hco@xmath0 ( at @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35, ... ghz ) . while co is far more abundant ( by about a factor of 1000 ) than hco@xmath0 in the interstellar medium , the hco@xmath0 rotational lines have a higher einstein - a coefficient than the corresponding co rotational lines , implying that the hco@xmath0 optical depth along a sightline is typically about an order of magnitude lower than the co optical depth .",
    "the efficiency of a mm - wave molecular absorption survey is thus significantly increased because observations covering a given frequency range are sensitive to absorption in multiple redshift ranges , corresponding to the different co and hco@xmath0 transitions .",
    "for example , an observing frequency of 40  ghz corresponds to redshifts @xmath36  ( hco@xmath37 ) , @xmath38  ( co  @xmath39 ) , @xmath40  ( hco@xmath41 ) , @xmath42  ( co  @xmath43 ) , etc .",
    "one can thus choose the observing frequency band so as to maximize the redshift range towards a background source , thus increasing the survey efficiency .",
    "taking into account the frequency dependence of the atmospheric opacity , the best observing frequency range for a radio molecular absorption survey appears to be @xmath44  ghz .",
    "this would be sensitive to absorption in the redshift ranges @xmath45 ( hco@xmath37 ) , @xmath46 ( co  @xmath39 ) , @xmath47 ( hco@xmath41 ) , @xmath48 ( co  @xmath43 ) , etc .",
    "in other words , a survey covering @xmath49  ghz would be able to detect absorption by galaxies at _ all redshifts @xmath50 _ in the co and hco@xmath0 lines .",
    "further , the relatively small frequency range implies fewer frequency settings per source and thus a high survey efficiency .",
    "we hence originally aimed to use the gbt ka- and q - band receivers and the acs to search for redshifted absorption in the frequency range @xmath49  ghz .    in passing ,",
    "we note that a similar absorption survey is possible at higher frequencies , in the 2-mm or 3-mm bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the observing frequency range @xmath51  ghz provides access to _ all redshifts @xmath52 _ in the co and hco@xmath0 lines .",
    "however , a higher observing frequency implies both a larger frequency range ( i.e. more frequency settings ) to cover the same redshift path and weaker background sources .",
    "further , using a high observing frequency would effectively target the high - j rotational lines for higher redshift absorbers . in normal galaxies , the lower co / hco@xmath0 rotational levels",
    "are likely to be highly populated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that the low - j rotational transitions should yield the strongest absorption lines .",
    "all of these indicate that the frequency range @xmath49  ghz is likely to be the best for molecular absorption surveys , despite the fact that it only allows access to relatively high redshifts , @xmath53 .",
    "one might extend the survey coverage to lower redshifts by additional observations in the 3-mm band .",
    "for a molecular absorption survey , it is critical that the target selection be based on radio criteria .",
    "this is because the sample should contain no bias against optically faint active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which might be dim due to extinction by dust associated with a molecular absorber along the sightline",
    ". it would also be useful if the sample were selected from a radio survey as close to the observing frequency ( @xmath54  ghz ) as possible , to reduce uncertainties in the source flux density .",
    "unfortunately , at the time of the gbt observations ( 2006 ) , there were no deep all - sky radio surveys at high frequencies , @xmath54  ghz , in the literature .",
    "we hence chose to construct our main target sample from the well known 1  jy sample @xcite .",
    "this covers the whole sky excluding the galactic plane ( i.e. @xmath55 ) and the magellanic clouds and is expected to be complete to a flux density of @xmath56  jy at 5  ghz .",
    "we restricted our targets to declinations @xmath57 so that all sources could be observed at a reasonable elevation at the gbt .",
    "finally , we used redshift information from the literature to exclude all sources with redshifts @xmath58 , to ensure sufficient redshift path ( @xmath59 ) for even the lowest redshift targets .",
    "we emphasize that sources without known redshifts were retained in the sample .",
    "the survey is hence not biased against targets possibly obscured by dust and , hence , without optical redshifts . finally ,",
    "while the statistical analysis will be restricted to the 1  jy sample , we also augmented the sample with six sources without known redshifts from the ucsd survey @xcite .",
    "our initial sample consisted of 113  targets , 93 with measured redshifts between @xmath60 and @xmath61 and 20 without known redshifts .",
    "before embarking on the gbt spectroscopy , we used the very large array ( vla ) in its d - configuration ( proposal ak619 ) in 2005 to obtain 43  ghz flux densities for 86  sources of the sample .",
    "the vla observations used 1-minute on - source integrations and two 50-mhz if bands , with the data analysed in aips .",
    "the flux densities of the remaining 27 sources were obtained from the literature .",
    "these flux densities were used to plan the gbt spectroscopy , with observing times chosen so as to achieve relatively uniform optical depth sensitivity in the co  @xmath39 and hco@xmath37 lines .    our initial gbt observations ( proposal 05c-043 ) used the ka - band and q - band receivers in 2006 to cover the frequency range @xmath62  ghz , with bandpass calibration via position - switching on timescales of 1  minute .",
    "the ka - band was found to have high system temperatures over @xmath63  ghz , and data from both receivers were affected by variable structure in the passband that could not be calibrated out . after a number of tests of the system stability , we re - designed the survey in proposal 07c-018 , using the q - band receiver to cover the frequency range @xmath64  ghz .",
    "position - switching on timescales of 1  minute was initially used for passband calibration , but this did not yield spectral baselines of the requisite quality .",
    "the second part of the survey hence used sub - reflector nodding , on timescales of 4.5  seconds , for passband calibration .",
    "this strategy was found to give smooth spectra over each 800  mhz acs sub - band that could be fitted with a 5th- or 6th - order polynomial .",
    "the final gbt observations for the absorption survey were carried out in 2008 , using the acs , 3-level sampling , 2 polarizations , and two 800  mhz sub - bands , overlapped by 100  mhz to yield a total bandwidth of 1.5  ghz .",
    "each 800  mhz sub - band was divided into 2048 channels , giving velocity resolutions of @xmath65  km  s@xmath66  after hanning smoothing . for each source , we used seven overlapping frequency settings , each with a net bandwidth of 1.5  ghz , to cover the frequency range @xmath3  ghz . the large overheads from sub - reflector nodding meant that we were only able to observe 38  sources of the sample with this mode .",
    "note that these were selected randomly from the full sample , based on whether they could be observed during the scheduled runs ; as such , there was no bias towards brighter sources .",
    "the total integration times per source were @xmath67  minutes , with 1.5  second records , with longer integrations on the fainter sources so as to obtain comparable optical depth sensitivity .",
    "the flux density scale was calibrated using online measurements of the system temperatures with a blinking noise diode .",
    "the gbt data were initially analysed in the package gbtidl , using standard procedures .",
    "minor data editing was needed due to a few spectrometer failures . after flagging , gain and bandpass calibration ,",
    "the 1.5-second records were averaged to produce fourteen 800  mhz spectra for each source ( 7 frequency settings per source , each with two 800  mhz acs sub - bands ) , covering @xmath68  ghz . in all",
    ", there were 532 such 800  mhz spectra ( 38  sources and 14  spectra per source ) , which were then analysed independently , outside gbtidl .",
    "a polynomial of order @xmath69 was fitted to each 800  mhz spectrum ( excluding edge channels ) , and subtracted out to produce a residual spectrum . beginning with a 3rd - order fit",
    ", the residuals were tested for gaussianity , using an anderson - darling test @xcite .",
    "if the residuals were found to be non - gaussian ( @xmath70 in the anderson - darling test ) , the procedure was repeated after increasing the order , upto order @xmath71 .",
    "if even a 6th - order fit was found to yield non - gaussian residuals , the spectrum was dropped from the later analysis .",
    "this approach was followed so as to avoid the possibility of fitting out possible absorption features .",
    "we verified in all cases that the fitted polynomials were smooth on scales @xmath72  km  s@xmath66 , implying that narrow absorption lines would not be affected by the fitting procedure .",
    "ninety - four spectra were excluded due to the non - gaussianity of the residuals after the 6th - order polynomial fit , mostly due to acs failures and radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , especially at the upper end of the frequency range .",
    "the rejected 94 spectra were also inspected by eye to ensure that the non - gaussianity did not arise due to the presence of spectral features .    after the above procedure , 438 spectra were retained towards 36  targets ( two sources were entirely removed ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table : sample ] , whose columns are ( 1 )  the agn name , ( 2 )  the agn redshift , for sources with known redshifts , ( 3 )  the usable frequency range , after all data editing , ( 4 )  the median rms optical depth @xmath73 over the usable frequency range , and ( 5 )  the redshift path for each source with a known redshift , summing over the the three co and hco@xmath0 transitions . in passing , we note that two of the three sources without redshifts have barely been detected in deep keck r - band images ( @xmath74 ) , while the third has @xmath75 @xcite ; none are from the 1  jy sample .    fig .

    "the search for absorption features in the spectra with @xmath81 was carried out at velocity resolutions of @xmath82  km  s@xmath66 , smoothing the spectra to the resolution of interest to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
