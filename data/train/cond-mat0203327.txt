    "the physical properties of the austenite solid solution phase have been studied extensively over the years in connection with , e.g. , the assessment and understanding of the phase diagram [ 1 - 6 ] , the diffusion controlled [ 7 ] and martensitic phase transitions in fe - c alloys [ 8 ] . in austenite",
    "the iron atoms are arranged in a close - packed face - centred cubic ( _ fcc _ ) lattice , and the c atoms occupy a limited number of the octahedral interstices which are located at the centres and at the mid - points of the edges of the unit cubes , these two positions being crystallographically equivalent ( fig.1 ) [ 9 ] .",
    "accordingly , various models of austenite have been proposed which are based on assuming two sublattices , one for the fe atoms and the second one for the mixture of carbon atoms ( c ) and vacant octahedral interstices ( va ) .",
    "the general theme of the present paper is the distribution of the c atoms in the interstitial sites , as revealed by three complementary sources of information , viz .",
    ", thermodynamic properties , mssbauer experiments and monte carlo simulations .    in the ideal solution model ( ism ) for thermodynamic properties of austenite it is assumed that c and va distribute themselves at random in the octahedral interstitial sites , the amount of which is equal to the number of fe atoms . on these basis ,",
    "the thermodynamic activity ( @xmath2 ) of c in an ideal mixture of n@xmath3 carbon atoms with n@xmath4 iron atoms is shown to be proportional to the ratio @xmath5 , where @xmath6 = n@xmath3/n@xmath4 , and @xmath7 represent the fraction of occupied and of empty interstitial sites , respectively [ 10 - 13 ] . since the experimental @xmath2 in austenite deviates positively from the ism , many approaches have been proposed to account for the non - ideal behaviour [ 14 - 22 ] .",
    "the reader is referred to ref . [ 23 ] for a recent review of the work of most relevance for the present study . in the strict version of the approach known as the hard - blocking excluded - sites model ( hbesm ) it is assumed that the presence of a solute atom blocks the occupancy of a certain number ( @xmath8 ) of the nearest neighbor interstitial sites ( nnis ) , so that a site is either blocked or is available for the mixing of c atoms and va [ 9 , 15 , 23 ] .",
    "further , if the mixing in the non - blocked sites occurs at random , the @xmath2 in austenite becomes proportional to @xmath9 $ ] [ 23 ] .",
    "frequently , @xmath8 has been treated as an adjustable parameter , identified with the value to be inserted in the expression for @xmath2 in order to reproduce the experimental data [ 9,19,22,23 ] .",
    "alternatively , some theoretical studies have been reported which suggest that @xmath8 should in fact be treated as composition dependent [ 18,19 ] .",
    "a different approach will be explored in the present work , which is based on combining two theoretical methods .",
    "first , we will adopt the quasi - chemical approximation ( qca ) to the statistical mechanics of interstitial solutions [ 12,24 - 27 ] . in the qca all interstitial sites are available for mixing , but the c atoms are regarded as exerting a repulsive force on each other , so that they enter adjacent interstitial positions less frequently as would be the case if their distribution were random .",
    "thus the qca will allow us to treat soft - blocking effects in austenite .",
    "the key parameters in this treatment are the energies of formation of the c - c and c - va pairs , which will be accurately determined by analysing @xmath2 data .",
    "secondly , we will perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for various values of the n@xmath3/n@xmath4 ratio , using the pair formation energies from the quasi - chemical analysis . in this way",
    ", the average distribution of interstitials around a given c atom will be studied as function of composition . in particular",
    ", the average number of empty nnis will be determined for various alloys , and compared with the results of previous studies , as well as with information extracted from mssbauer experiments .    in the analysis of the mssbauer spectra of austenite various assumptions about the distribution of c in the octahedral interstitial sites",
    "have been proposed [ 28,29 ] . in particular ,",
    "a model has been suggested for dilute solutions in which the 12 nnis of a c atom are excluded [ 28 ] . in this case",
    "the c atoms occupy only the centre of the cubes of a structure with the formula fe@xmath0c@xmath1 , so that three possible environments for fe atoms , associated to different hyperfine interaction may be distinguished , which are shown schematically in fig.2 , viz .",
    "fe atoms without nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor c atoms , associated to the singlet @xmath10 .    \\b .",
    "fe atoms without nearest neighbour but with @xmath11 next nearest neighbour c atoms ( @xmath12 ) , ascribed to the singlet @xmath13 .",
    "fe atoms with one c atom nearest neighbour but without next nearest c neighbours , related to doublet @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , a model [ 29 ] has been proposed in which all the octahedral sites of the _ fcc _ structure are available for occupation and no assumptions are made on the distribution of the c atoms in the second interstitial shell .",
    "the various fe - c environments involved in this type of model are shown schematically in fig.3 , viz .",
    "fe atoms without nearest neighbours c atoms , associated to the singlet @xmath15 .",
    "fe atoms with one nearest neighbor c atom , or fe atoms with two c atoms nearest neighbours at 90@xmath16 from each other , related to the doublet @xmath17 .",
    "fe atoms with two c atoms placed at opposite nearest sites ( 180@xmath16 ) , ascribed to the doublet @xmath18 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide new experimental and theoretical information on the distribution of c atoms in the octahedral sites of the austenite phase .",
    "the work proceeds as follows .",
    "first , mssbauer experiments are performed on a series of alloys with up to 12 at.% .",
    "five fe - c compacted graphite alloys were prepared in a medium frequency induction furnace using the sandwich technique in ladle to treat the liquid metal . the necessary amount of si , mg , ce and ca was added to obtain compacted graphite morphology .",
    "the final alloy contained 3.40 wt.%c , 2.35 wt.%si , 0.58 wt.%mn , 0.04 wt.%cu , 0.01 wt.%p , and 0.02 wt.%s .",
    "samples of 20 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness were taken from ",
    "y - shape  blocks ( astm a-395 ) cast in sand moulds.samples s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 and s5 ( see below ) were annealed at 1173k during 30 minutes , quenched in a salt bath and held at 623k during 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 10 minutes respectively .",
    "the samples for mssbauer spectroscopy were prepared by conventional grinding techniques to reduce their thickness down to about 70 mm , using diamond paste of 6 , 1 and 0.1 mm for final polishing .",
    "x - ray measurements were performed in a philips pw1710 diffractometer using the monochromatic _",
    "k_@xmath19 radiation of cu , in brag brentano s geometry , with a step mode collection of 0.02 , 10s by step , with 2@xmath20 ranging from 39@xmath16 to 98@xmath16 .",
    "the x - ray patterns , presented in fig.4 , were analysed with the rietveld method [ 30 ] . the actual c concentration in the samples",
    "was determined by combining the lattice - parameters ( @xmath21 ) extracted from the diffraction patterns with the known a versus composition relation for _ fcc _ fe - c alloys [ 28 ] .",
    "the resulting lattice - parameter and the inferred @xmath6 values for the various alloys are listed in table i.      mssbauer spectra were taken in a transmission geometry using a 57co source of approximately 5mci intensity and recorded in a standard 512 channels conventional constant acceleration spectrometer . in order to analyse in detail the austenite pattern , the spectra were taken in the velocity range between - 2 and + 2 mm / s .",
    "velocity calibration was performed against a 12 mm thick @xmath22 - fe foil .",
    "all isomer shifts were referred to this standard at 298k .",
    "the spectra were fitted to lorentzian line shapes using a non - linear least - squares program with constraints . for the effective thickness of the samples analysed",
    "no voigt line - shape correction was necessary [ 31 ] .",
    "the results of the mssbauer experiments are shown in fig.5 .",
    "the central subspectra were associated to austenite , whereas the external lines on the spectra to ferrite / martensite phases [ 28 ] .",
    "the hyperfine parameters and the relative fractions f@xmath23 ( @xmath24 = number of c atoms in the first and second coordination shell , respectively ) associated to the various fe environments obtained using the models [ 28,29 ] referred to in sect.i are listed in table ii . concerning the second model [ 29 ] , the contribution to the spectra of the doublet @xmath18 associated to fe sites with two c atoms placed in opposite interstitial sites resulted undetectable by the present technique .",
    "the austenite interstitial solid solution is described as a lattice gas of n@xmath25 carbon atoms and n@xmath26 vacancies , distributed in the n@xmath3 + n@xmath26 = n = n@xmath4 octahedral interstitial sites of the _ fcc _ structure ( fig .",
    "1 ) associated to n@xmath4 iron atoms .",
    "the occupancy of the first and second interstitial shell was accounted for in three - dimensional mc simulations to calculate the number @xmath27 ( @xmath28 = c or va ) of c - c , c - va and va - va pairs , the relative fractions f@xmath23 associated to the different fe environments , and the number c@xmath29 of c atoms having @xmath30 c atoms in the first interstitial coordination shell and none in the next interstitial shell .    a fortran 77 routine using the monte carlo method , an ising - type hamiltonian and periodic boundary conditions was developed . metropolis method was used to define the probability of the c jumps .",

    "the fe atoms remain still during the simulation , and their positions were only used to calculate the number of @xmath27 pairs and the relative fractions f@xmath23 associated to the different fe environments .    in order to study the convergence of the results , cells of 4@xmath43 , 6@xmath43 , 8@xmath44 and 10@xmath43 were used . for simulations using cell sizes of 6@xmath43 and higher",
    "the @xmath27 and f@xmath23 fractions did not vary , hence cells of 864 fe atoms and the corresponding number of c atoms were employed to decrease the calculation time . for all c concentrations ,",
    "the equilibrium of the system was attained approximately at three mc steps , where a mc step is defined as n@xmath3 attempts of movement of a c atom .",
    "finally , the occupation of the interstitial sites was characterised using the average number @xmath45 of empty nnis , which was calculated from the mc results as follows :    @xmath46      the energy of formation of a c - c pair that enters in the mc calculation was determined by analysing experimental @xmath2 data in terms of the qca to the statistical mechanics of the fe - c solutions developed by bhadeshia [ 27 ] . this formalism yields for the activity @xmath2 @xmath47\\left\\ { \\left ( \\frac{% y_c}{1-y_c}\\right ) ^2\\left ( \\frac{1-y_c-\\frac{\\overline{\\lambda } } { n_{va}}}{% 1-y_c}\\right ) \\right\\ } ^{\\frac{-z}2}\\exp [ \\frac{-z\\delta \\varepsilon } { 2rt } ] \\eqnum{3}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 ( = 12 ) is the number of nnis , and @xmath49g@xmath50 is the gibbs energy of c in austenite relative to graphite .",

    "this one was adopted in the mc simulations .",
    "the number of pairs @xmath27 calculated for @xmath58 using the quasichemical formalism ( table iii ) are plotted in fig .",

    "are plotted using symbols .",
    "the inset there gives a comparison for the composition range corresponding to the experimental solubility of c in austenite , viz .",
    ", @xmath60 .",
    "there is a very good agreement between the qca and the mc predictions for @xmath27 , which encourages a discussion of the mc results for the relative fractions f@xmath23 of the various fe environments , as functions of @xmath6 .",
    "the mc results for the f@xmath23 as functions of @xmath6 are plotted in fig .",
    "according to the present simulations the main contributions to the mssbauer spectra originate in the fe environments without c atoms in the first interstitial shell ( f@xmath61 and f@xmath62 ) .",
    "next in importance is the contribution of environments with one c atom in the first interstitial shell and none in the second ( f@xmath63 ) .",
    "further , the simulations show that the contribution of fe atoms having the first and second interstitial shells occupied ( f@xmath64 ) is not negligible , which indicates that this kind of fe environments should be accounted for in fitting mssbauer spectra .",
    "figure 8 also demonstrates that the relative fraction associated to fe atoms with more than one c atom in the first interstitial shell and without c atoms in the second shell ( f@xmath65 ) is negligible .",
    "this result contradicts the assumption of one of the models [ 29 ] developed to interpret the mssbauer pattern of the austenite , which was reviewed in sect.i .",
    "in fact , we find that the contribution of fe environments with two c atoms either at 90@xmath16 or 180@xmath16 is negligible .    in order to compare the mc results with the results of analysing the present mssbauer spectra ( table ii ) , the relative fractions f@xmath61 and the sum f@xmath66 = f@xmath61 + f@xmath62",
    "were chosen as the key quantities in the fe@xmath67c@xmath1 model [ 28 ] and the random model [ 29 ] , respectively .",
    "the reason for this choice is that fe environment with c atoms in the first and the second interstitial shells have not been considered by any of the models proposed to reproduce the mssbauer spectra [ 28,29 ] .",
    "moreover , we have also shown that the fraction of fe environments with two c atoms in the first shell is negligible according to mc results .",
    "hence , the only fractions that can be determined without ambiguity for these models are f@xmath61 and f@xmath68 , respectively .    a comparison between the f@xmath61 and f@xmath66 versus composition values extracted from the mssbauer spectra ( open symbols ) and the mc simulations ( filled symbols ) is presented in fig . 9 .",
    "according to fig .",
    "9 the  random model  underestimates significantly the contribution of the fe environments without nearest neighbour c atoms .",
    "this suggests that in this composition range , some blocking effect of the nnis in austenite should be accounted for . in agreement with this expectation ,",
    "the mc results fit remarkably well with the f@xmath61 values extracted from mssbauer experiments when the fe@xmath0c@xmath1 model is adopted , i.e. , the model including some blocking effect of the interstitial sites .",
    "finally , mc simulations have been reported previously [ 32 ] which are based on extracting from mssbauer measurements a weak c - c repulsion in the first coordination shell ( w@xmath69 = 830 cal / mol ) and a stronger one ( w@xmath70 = 1730 cal / mol ) in the second shell .",
    "such calculations were interpreted [ 29,32 ] as indications that the fe@xmath0c@xmath1 model is not adequate to represent the austenite phase .",
    "similar results ( w@xmath69 = 830 cal / mol ) were arrived at in ref . [ 29 ] by assuming that pairs of c atoms can occupy the first interstitial shell either at 90@xmath16 or at 180@xmath16 .",
    "the present mc results , based on energies extracted from thermodynamic data , do not support these results .      in fig .",
    "10 the average number of empty nnis @xmath45 obtained from the mc simulations is plotted as function of @xmath6 ( symbols ) .",
    "the @xmath45 values corresponding to the composition of the present experimental alloys are plotted using empty symbols .",
    "the dashed line in this graphic refers to the @xmath71 value corresponding to a random mixture , viz . , @xmath72 .",
    "the empty symbols in fig.10 indicate that already in alloys with @xmath73 the nnis of the c atoms are , on the average , less occupied than in a random mixture .",
    "this fact is in qualitative agreement with the ideas behind the excluded - sites model , which motivates the following analysis of the blocking effects in models for @xmath2 in austenite .",
    "it has recently been pointed out [ 23 ] that in a strict hard - blocking model , empty sites must be interpreted as blocked sites .",
    "this implies that the @xmath8 parameter of the hbesm ( sect.i ) should be considered as equal to @xmath45 ( fig.10 ) .",
    "two consequences of such interpretation will be discussed .",
    "the first consequence is that the mc results in fig.10 can not be represented using the hbesm unless the @xmath8 parameter is allowed to vary with composition .",
    "in qualitative agreement with this , oates et al . [ 21 ] interpreted their own @xmath45 values from mc calculations as a composition dependent @xmath8 parameter , decreasing with the increase in the c content .",
    "however , the excluded sites model does not explain the composition dependence of @xmath8 , which has stimulated some attempts to improve the simple picture by invoking , e.g. , overlapping of the sites excluded by different interstitial atoms [ 17,19,21,23 ] .",
    "the second consequence of the current [ 23 ] interpretation of the hard - blocking is that fig .",
    "10 yields @xmath8 ( = @xmath45 ) 10 in the composition range @xmath74 .",
    "however , these values can not be reconciled with those extracted from experimental @xmath2 data .",
    "the latter are integral and non - integral @xmath8 values falling in the range 3 @xmath8 5 [ 9,19,22,23 ] .    in view of these facts",
    "we conclude that the strict form of the excluded - sites model ( sect.i ) does not seem able to account for the present blocking effects by using the same @xmath8 values which are known to reproduce the experimental @xmath2 data .",
    "it is also evident that a more realistic account of such effects would require abandoning the one - parameter formula for @xmath2 , i.e. , what has been considered as the main advantage of the hbesm [ 23 ] .",
    "in the present study the energy parameters describing the interstitial solution of c in the _ fcc _ phase of fe have been obtained by analyzing experimental thermodynamic data in terms of the quasichemical approximation .",
    "these parameters have been used as input information in monte carlo simulations , and various key quantities have been obtained . in particular , the composition dependence of various f@xmath75 ratios , describing the relative weight of the various fe configurations contributing to the mssbauer spectra of fe - c austenite , have been predicted and compared with those derived by modelling the mssbauer spectra . in this way , two alternative models [ 28,29 ] for the contribution of the fe environments have been tested .",
    "the present comparison between mssbauer and theoretical results indicates that a description similar to the fe@xmath0c structure [ 28 ] should be preferred for the fe - c austenite phase .",
    "such a model [ 28 ] is usually associated to the blocking of some of the nearest neighbour interstitial sites by a c atom .",
    "however , the present results can not be accounted for by the simplest hard - blocking excluded sites model , often used to provide a one - parameter formula for the activity of c in austenite .",
    "we believe that the picture of blocking effects in austenite emerging from the present study should be useful in further attempts to refine the current models for thermodynamics of interstitial solutions .",
