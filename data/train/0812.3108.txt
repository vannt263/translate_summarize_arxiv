    "conformal field theories in two dimensions can be used to describe string theory from the worldsheet perspective and statistical systems at a second order phase transition .",
    "the study of these field theories is often manageable because the infinite dimensional symmetry algebras which exist can reduce the field content to a finite number of representations . in such minimal cases , there are ` null vectors ' which should decouple from all correlation functions . as a result",
    "the non - zero correlation functions satisfy differential equations which enable one to solve the theory completely .",
    "each symmetry algebra has its own series of minimal models for which this procedure works .",
    "the simplest case is that of minimal models of the virasoro algebra . in @xcite , belavin",
    "et al showed how to relate correlation functions of arbitrary fields in a virasoro minimal model to those of a particular class of fields , called primary fields , and in turn showed how differential equations for four - point functions of primary fields could be found from the singular vectors that are present in these models .",
    "the virasoro algebra can be extended by extra generators to include supersymmetry , and the simplest of these extensions is the @xmath0 superconformal algebra .",
    "although the @xmath0 superconformal algebra includes the virasoro algebra , there is an infinite set of minimal models of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra which only includes a few minimal models of the virasoro algebra , and the methods of @xcite need to be generalised to find the differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions of primary fields of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra .",
    "the first thing to note is that the superconformal algebra comes in two forms , called the neveu - schwarz ( ns ) and ramond ( r ) algebras , and accordingly has two classes of representations and fields associated to these representations .",
    "the differential equations for correlations functions of four ns  type fields were worked out in @xcite , but the extension to correlation functions of four ramond fields has problems @xcite and the solution to these problems presented here requires an extension of ideas in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we perform this extension and find differential equations for correlation functions of four r  type fields .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : we first introduce the ns and r algebras and describe their representations and singular vectors .",
    "we discuss their three point functions and describe the chiral blocks and how the singular vectors allow them to be found level - by - level .",
    "next we describe the toy model of the ising model and show how one can obtain a differential equation for the four - spin field correlation function , as in @xcite .",
    "next we apply these ideas to the ramond correlation functions .",
    "this lets us write down a matrix - differential equation for the correlation functions .",
    "we check these by comparison with known results and present the exact solution for a variety of cases .",
    "the algebra of chiral superconformal transformations in the plane is generated by two fields , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . according to the choice of boundary conditions on @xmath3",
    ", one may choose the labels @xmath4 on @xmath5 to be integer or half - integer ; the algebra in these two sectors are called the ramond and neveu schwarz algebras respectively . in both sectors",

    "this allows one to consider states of definite parity and is essential in many constructions . in a superconformal field theory",
    "the physically relevant representations of the superconformal algebra are irreducible highest weight representations .",
    "these are graded by @xmath10 eigenvalue , or level .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "highest weight representations of the neveu - schwarz algebra have a state of least @xmath10 eigenvalue @xmath11 such that @xmath12 if one considers the extended algebra then it is usual to take the highest weight state bosonic ( @xmath13 ) or fermionic ( @xmath14 ) in which case the addition of the fermion number operator does not alter the representation theory .",
    "it is useful to parametrise @xmath15 and @xmath16 as @xmath17 since there is a singular vector of @xmath10 eigenvalue @xmath18 whenever @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( see refs .",
    "note that the highest weight state can be either bosonic or fermionic , for example , the ns vacuum state @xmath23 is usually regarded as bosonic and so the ns highest weight state @xmath24 is fermionic .",
    "the highest weight representation @xmath25 is spanned by states of the form @xmath26 and the level of such as state is @xmath27 .",
    "states with even numbers of modes of @xmath28 have integer level and states with odd numbers of modes have half - integer level and hence @xmath29 where @xmath30 is spanned by integer level states and @xmath31 by half - integer level states .",
    "highest weight representations of the extended ramond algebra have , in general , a two - dimensional highest weight space spanned by states @xmath32 of definite fermion parity @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be chosen freely ; representations with different @xmath37 are equivalent .",
    "such a representation has two singular vectors at level @xmath38 whenever @xmath39 , @xmath40 an odd integer , @xmath20 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 we shall mostly be concerned with the constraints arising from the vanishing of the singular vectors at level 1 in the representation @xmath43 which take the form @xmath44",
    "we would like to find the chiral blocks of four ramond fields @xmath45 where the intermediate states lie in a particular ns representation .",
    "we can do this step - by - step by first calculating the operator product expansions ( opes ) @xmath46 and then forming the chiral block by summing over intermediate states . to do this",
    "we need to define the vertex operators @xmath47 of fixed fermion parity and we also need to specify whether the ns representation in the intermediate channel is bosonic or fermionic .    for the field operators , we shall use the definition in @xcite : @xmath48 where the combinations @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath51 @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath4 can be integral or half - integral as circumstances dictate ( here @xmath54 play the same role as @xmath55 in and @xmath56 as @xmath37 ) .",
    "it turns out that the four opes in depend on only two quantities .",
    "it is convenient to form the following four linear combinations : @xmath57 we shall first consider the case where the ns highest weight state is bosonic and the opes depend on the two constants @xmath58 . using and the standard result for the virasoro algebra ( see )",
    ", we can calculate the overlaps of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we list here the first few , taking @xmath61 for convenience : @xmath62 if we take the ns representation to be fermionic rather than bosonic , then @xmath63 and @xmath64 just swap roles in these equations , so without loss of generality we consider henceforth the intermediate channel to be bosonic .",
    "given these combinations @xmath65 , it is possible to define the chiral blocks and calculate them to be @xmath66 where ` even ' denotes projection of the intermediate states onto @xmath67 and ` odd ' , projection onto @xmath68 , where we again note that we have assumed that @xmath11 is bosonic .",
    "the vanishing of the state imposes constraints on the allowed fusions of the fields @xmath69 and in fact allows one to determine the operator products @xmath70 and @xmath71 recursively .",
    "we take @xmath72 as this simplifies the constraints on @xmath15 , and we shall denote @xmath73 by @xmath63 and @xmath74 by @xmath75 for simplicity .",
    "if we use the equation ( valid for any virasoro primary field of weight @xmath15 ) @xmath76 and the relations , we find that @xmath63 and @xmath75 satisfy @xmath77 where we assume the representation @xmath15 to be bosonic .",
    "taking @xmath15 fermionic simply swaps @xmath63 with @xmath75 . considering the contribution of the highest weight state @xmath11 to @xmath63",
    ", we see that @xmath78 so that @xmath63 is only non - zero if @xmath79 .",

    "the ising model can be formulated as the theory of a single free fermion field @xmath101 . as with the superconformal algebra ,",
    "this field can have half - integer ( ns ) or integer ( r ) modes @xmath102 satisfying @xmath103 the ramond algebra has a zero mode @xmath104 satisfying @xmath105 and so there are two inequivalent irreducible highest weight representations of the ramond algebra , with highest weights @xmath106 satisfying @xmath107 a unitary highest weight representation of the ramond algebra will have a highest weight space on which @xmath104 is represented by a matrix with eigenvalues @xmath108 .",
