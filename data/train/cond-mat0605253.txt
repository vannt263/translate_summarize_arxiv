    "the aim of this letter is to explore numerically how micron - scale drops move on superhydrophobic surfaces .",
    "if surfaces with contact angles greater than @xmath0 are patterned with posts small compared to the drop dimensions the equilibrium contact angle is increased and can reach values close to @xmath1 .",
    "such superhydrophobic surfaces are found in nature : for example the leaves of several plants , such as the lotus are covered in tiny bumps which may have evolved to aid the run - off of rain water .",
    "recent microfabrication techniques have allowed superhydrophobic patterning to be mimicked and carefully controlled experiments on the behaviour of drops on superhydrophobic substrates are increasingly becoming feasible@xcite .",
    "drops on superhydrophobic surfaces can be in two states . suspended drops lie on top of the posts with air pockets beneath them whereas collapsed drops fill the interstices between the posts .",
    "a suspended drop has a higher contact angle than the equivalent collapsed drop which in turn has a higher contact angle than a drop on a flat surface made of the same material .",
    "several authors have shown that the equilibrium properties of the drops follow from thermodynamic arguments based on free energy minimisation  @xcite .",
    "both the suspended and collapsed states can provide the global minimum of the free energy , with the phase boundary between them depending on the surface tension , the contact angle on the flat surface and the post geometries  @xcite .",
    "the suspended drop may often exist as a metastable state as it has to cross a free energy barrier to fill the grooves  @xcite .",
    "there is , however , no similar understanding of the way drops move across superhydrophobic surfaces .",
    "several authors  @xcite have considered contact angle hysteresis in the context of whether a drop is pinned or moves as a surface is tilted .",
    "the consensus of both theoretical and experimental work is that a suspended drop on a superhydrophobic surface starts to move much more easily than the equivalent drop on a smooth surface .",
    "only a few results have been published about the steady - state velocities of moving drops .",

    "@xcite have shown that the drag on a hydrofoil decreases by @xmath2 if it is covered by a superhydrophobic coating .",

    "@xcite have used molecular dynamics simulations to explore the behaviour of a fluid moving across a superhydrophobic surface comprising nanometre posts .",
    "they find that the slip is enhanced by a factor @xmath4 when the fluid does not fill the space between the posts and reduced by a factor @xmath5 when it does , as compared to a flat surface of the same ( hydrophobic ) material .",
    "in this letter we explore movement across a superhydrophobic surface by using a lattice boltzmann approach to solve the equations of motion of a drop pushed gently by a constant force .",
    "this approach has been shown to agree well with experiments for spreading and moving drops on chemically striped surfaces  @xcite . here",
    "we consider both suspended and collapsed drops on superhydrophobic surfaces and investigate how the drop velocity depends on the post spacing .",
    "we find that the velocity of suspended drops is essentially determined by the effective contact angle and increases as the number of posts decreases",
    ". collapsed drops , however , behave in a very different way .",
    "the posts now impede the drop behaviour and for large post densities the flow pushes the drop back to a suspended position on top of the posts .",
    "we consider a liquid - gas system of density @xmath6 and volume @xmath7 .",
    "the surface is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the drop are described by the ginzburg - landau free energy @xmath9 where einstein notation is understood for the cartesian label @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the free energy in the bulk . for convenience",
    "we choose a double well form .",
    "the derivative term in equation ( [ eq : freee ] ) models the free energy associated with density gradients at an interface .",
    "@xmath12 is related to the surface tension .",
    "@xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the density at the surface , is the cahn surface free energy  @xcite which controls the wetting properties of the fluid . in particular @xmath15",
    "can be used to tune the contact angle .",
    "the dynamics of the drop is described by the navier - stokes equations for a non - ideal gas @xmath16 + nf_\\alpha , \\label{eq : ns }   \\\\ \\partial_t n + \\partial_\\alpha(n u_\\alpha )   & = &   0 \\label{eq : cont } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the fluid velocity , @xmath18 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath19 a body force per unit volume . in what follows",
    ", we will refer the second term on the right hand side of the first equation as the viscous term .",
    "the pressure tensor @xmath20 is calculated from the free energy  @xcite .",
    "we use a lattice boltzmann algorithm that solve the equations of motion by following the evolution of particle distribution functions .",
    "this corresponds to a discretisation of a simplified boltzmann equation .",
    "details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we consider a drop of radius 30 moving on a domain of size @xmath21 lattice sites .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed along @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the surface at @xmath24 is flat and that at @xmath25 is patterned by posts in a square array with height , spacing and width denoted by @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively . unless otherwise specified @xmath29 .",
    "a contact angle @xmath30 is set on every substrate site by choosing a suitable value of the surface field @xmath15 . in equilibrium",
    "the drop forms a spherical cap with an enhanced contact angle .",
    "for example , if @xmath31 and @xmath32 the contact angle is @xmath33 for a drop resting on the posts and @xmath34 for a drop collapsed between the posts  @xcite .",
    "we impose a poiseuille flow by considering a constant body force @xmath35 per unit volume parallel to the surface corresponding to a bond number @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the surface tension and @xmath7 the drop volume .",
    "[ fig : velonposts](a ) shows the time average capillary number @xmath38 of the suspended drop as the width of the posts and the distance between the posts are varied .",
    "@xmath39 is the velocity of the drop and @xmath40 the liquid density .",
    "the @xmath41 result corresponds to a drop moving on a cushion of air ( of height @xmath42 ) , and the @xmath43 value to a drop moving on a flat surface of contact angle @xmath44 .",
    "it is striking how the data collapses onto a single curve if it is plotted as a function of the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "we also measured the velocity of drops moving on a ridged surface , considering both a drop moving parallel and perpendicular to the ridges .",
    "this data also collapses onto the same curve if plotted as a function of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the width of the ridges and @xmath48 the spacing between them .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : post](b ) compares the velocity of two drops , one ( f ) moving on a flat surface and the other ( p ) over a post . the velocities cease to be identical as soon as the drop meets the post . because of the distortion of the flow field the velocity of p is lower than that of f. the velocities become identical again as soon as the drop leaves the post .",
    "the velocity difference decreases as the height of the posts is decreased .    with this information we return to fig .",
    "[ fig : velonposts](b ) .",
    "increasing @xmath45 from @xmath49 corresponds to inserting posts into the drop path .",
    "as shown above this leads to increased dissipation as the posts distort the flow field .",
    "hence the velocity drops , the decrease being greater for the higher posts .    for @xmath45 above @xmath50 , the velocity jumps to a higher value and then decreases as more posts are inserted . here the velocities are identical to those measured for the suspended drop ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : velonposts](a ) ) .",
    "this is because the force drives a transition from the collapsed to the suspended state when posts cover a large fraction of the surface .",
    "the complicated behaviour for @xmath51 occurs because parts of the drop are collapsed and parts suspended .",
    "we have solved the hydrodynamic equations of motion for drops sliding over superhydrophobic surfaces . for drops suspended on the surfaces there is an increase in velocity of about @xmath52 as the number of posts is decreased to zero . we show that the main contribution to this effect is from the position of the drop in the poiseuille flow field . as the number of posts",
    "is decreased the contact angle increases and hence the drop lies , on average , further from the surface .",
    "thus it is subjected to a higher velocity field and moves more quickly .    for collapsed drops",
    "the situation is very different . here ,",
    "as posts are introduced , they impede the drop and its velocity falls . for a large number of posts ,",
    "as the drop is pushed , it prefers to revert to the suspended state .",
    "these results are consistent with the few experiments in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however the model we solve does include approximations to make it numerically tractable and it is important to be aware of these",
    ". in particular interfaces tend to move too easily , because , as with all mesoscale two - phase fluid simulations , simulated interface widths are too wide .",
    "the effect of this is that , given a set of input physical parameters , the simulation drop will move more quickly than a real drop . this can be accounted for by a rescaling of time by , for example , matching the capillary number at which the moving drop develops a corner in its trailing edge to experiment  @xcite .",
    "moreover it is necessary to choose boundary condition for the model .",
    "we have taken a non - slip condition on the velocity on every surface site : although there is evidence for increased local slip on hydrophobic surfaces this is still on the nano metre level and so would not show up on the scale of these simulations .",
    "the drops we consider are in the sliding , rather than the rolling regime .",
    "most experiments to date have been on highly viscous drops which roll  @xcite , but it is likely that there will soon be experiments on drops with lower viscosity which will allow interesting comparisons to the simulations reported here .",
