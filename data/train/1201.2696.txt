    "recent interest in study of parity - time ( pt ) symmetric optical potentials has its roots in quantum mechanics . in quantum mechanics , in order for the energy levels to be real and the theory to be probability conserving , it is usually assumed that the hamiltonian ( schrdinger ) operator be hermitian .",
    "however , in the past decade there has seen considerable attention @xcite in a weaker version of the hermiticity axiom which requires that the hamiltonian instead only exhibit space - time reflection symmetry ( pt symmetry ) . while there has been much theoretical success in developing a non - hermitian quantum field theory ,",
    "the phenomena unique to this class of pseudo - hermitian systems have not yet been observed experimentally .",
    "the same schrdinger equation from quantum mechanics applies also to optics .",
    "motivated by this connection , optical systems which have pt - symmetric potentials have been formulated @xcite .",
    "a pt - symmetric optical potential @xmath0 is realizable by the careful distribution of gain and loss in the media so that it satisfies the pt symmetry @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the spatial coordinate and ` @xmath3 ' stands for complex conjugation .",
    "that is , the refractive - index profile of the media is even and gain - loss profile is odd .",
    "such optical pt media have been created experimentally @xcite . these linear pt media undergo phase transition as the gain - loss component crosses a certain threshold @xcite . below this threshold ,",
    "all eigenvalues of the pt potential are real ; but above this threshold , complex eigenvalues appear , hence the intensity of a light beam grows exponentially during linear propagation .",
    "the nature of this phase transition ( especially for periodic pt potentials ) has not been fully understood yet .",
    "these phenomena may also be studied in a nonlinear context by considering the existence of localized modes called solitons @xcite .",
    "when a system contains gain and loss , solitons generally exist only at special values of the propagation constant @xcite .",
    "however , since pt potentials can admit all - real linear spectra , solitons could exist at continuous ranges of the propagation constant , which is quite remarkable .",
    "so far , soliton families in pt - symmetric periodic potentials with defects and in pt - symmetric nonlinear potentials have been investigated @xcite .",
    "but stability properties of these pt solitons ( especially in periodic pt potentials ) have not been carefully examined .    in this paper , we investigate linear phase transition and stability of ( nonlinear ) solitons in pt - symmetric periodic potentials ( optical lattices ) in both one and two spatial dimensions . our mathematical model is the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with a pt lattice potential , @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the focusing and defocusing nonlinearity , and the potential @xmath6 is periodic in @xmath7 and @xmath8 and satisfies the pt symmetry @xmath9 . for simplicity , we take this pt lattice potential to be @xmath10\\ ] ] in one dimension ( 1d ) and @xmath11\\right\\}\\ ] ] in two dimensions .",
    "here @xmath12 is the depth of the real component of the potential , @xmath13 is the relative magnitude of the imaginary component , and the period of this pt lattice is @xmath14 . for this system , we first show analytically that when the strength of the gain - loss component ( the imaginary part of @xmath6 ) in the pt lattice rises above a certain threshold ( phase - transition point ) , an infinite number of linear bloch bands turn complex simultaneously .",
    "this simultaneous bifurcation of an infinite number of complex eigenvalues at the phase transition point has never been reported before for any pt - symmetric potentials to our best knowledge @xcite .",
    "second , we show that while stable families of solitons can exist in pt lattices ( below the phase transition point ) , increasing the gain - loss component has an overall destabilizing effect on soliton propagation .",
    "specifically , when the gain - loss component increases , the parameter range of stable solitons shrinks as new regions of instability appear .",
    "thirdly , we investigate the evolution of unstable pt solitons under perturbations , and show that the energy of these perturbed solitons can grow unbounded even if the pt lattice is below the phase transition point .",
    "we begin by investigating the bifurcation of the continuous spectrum ( bloch bands ) of the linear schrdinger operator in eq .",
    "( [ e : model ] ) at the phase transition point .",
    "the phase transition point is a point above which the spectrum is no longer purely real as the strength of the imaginary ( gain - loss ) contribution relative to the real ( refractive - index ) contribution in the potential is increased .",
    "we will show that at the phase transition point , an infinite number of bloch bands turn complex simultaneously .",
    "we first consider this bifurcation in one dimension . in this case , the linear schrdinger equation is @xmath15 where the pt lattice potential @xmath16 is given in eq .",
    "( [ e : ptlattice ] ) .",
    "the continuous spectrum of this schrdinger equation consists of bloch modes of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a @xmath14-periodic function in @xmath7 , @xmath19 is the wavenumber in the irreducible brillouin zone @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the propagation constant . the values of @xmath21 and @xmath19 are related .",
