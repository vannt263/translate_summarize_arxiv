    "the observation of resonant structures in the excitation functions for various combinations of light @xmath1-cluster ( n = z ) nuclei in the energy regime from the barrier up to regions with excitation energies of e@xmath8 = 20 - 50  mev remains a subject of contemporary debate  @xcite .",
    "these resonances have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite .",
    "the question whether quasimolecular resonances represent true cluster states in the compound systems , or whether they simply reflect scattering states in the ion - ion potential is still unresolved  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "these resonant structures have been associated with strongly - deformed shapes and with clustering phenomena , predicted from the cranked @xmath1-cluster model  @xcite , hartree - fock calculations  @xcite and the nilsson - strutinsky approach  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the relationship between superdeformation ( sd ) and nuclear molecules , since nuclear shapes with major - to - minor axis ratios of 2:1 have the typical ellipsoidal elongation for light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the structure of possible octupole - unstable 3:1 nuclear shapes - hyperdeformation ( hd ) - for actinide nuclei has also been widely discussed  @xcite in terms of clustering phenomena .",
    "large ( quadrupole ) deformations and @xmath1-clustering in light n = z nuclei are known to be general phenomena at low excitation energy . for high angular momenta and higher excitation energies ,",
    "very elongated shapes are expected to occur in @xmath1-like nuclei for a@xmath9 = 20 - 60 .",
    "these predictions come from the generalized liquid - drop model , taking into account the proximity energy and quasi - molecular shapes  @xcite .",
    "in fact , highly deformed shapes and sd rotational bands have been recently discovered in several such n = z nuclei , in particular , @xmath10ar and @xmath11ca using @xmath0-ray spectroscopy techniques  @xcite .",
    "hd bands in @xmath10ar and its related ternary clusterizations are predicted theoretically @xcite . with",
    "the exception of the cluster decay of @xmath12ni recently studied using charged particle spectroscopy  @xcite , no evidence for ternary breakup has yet been reported @xcite in light nuclei ; the particle decay of @xmath10ar sd bands ( and other highly excited bands ) is still unexplored .",
    "the main binary reaction channels of the @xmath2mg+@xmath3c reaction , for which both resonant effects and orbiting phenomena @xcite have been observed , is investigated in this work by using charged particle-@xmath0-ray coincidence techniques .",
    "the study of charged particle-@xmath0-ray coincidences in binary reactions in inverse kinematics is a unique tool in the search for extreme shapes related to clustering phenomena . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the @xmath2mg+@xmath3c reaction with high selectivity at a bombarding energy e@xmath5(@xmath2 mg ) = 130 mev by using the binary reaction trigger spectrometer ( brs ) @xcite in coincidence with the euroball iv ( eb ) @xmath0-ray spectrometer  @xcite installed at the vivitron tandem facility of strasbourg .",
    "the @xmath2 mg beam was produced and accelerated by the vivitron , negative mgh@xmath13 ions were extracted from the ion source and then the mgh molecules were cracked at the stripping foils of the terminal accelerator . the beam intensity was kept constant at approximately 5 pna .",
    "the targets consisted of 200 @xmath14g/@xmath15 thick foils of natural c. the choice of the @xmath16 reaction implies that for an incident beam energy of e@xmath5 = 130  mev an excitation energy range up to e@xmath17 = 30  mev in @xmath2 mg is covered .",
    "the brs , in conjunction with eb , gives access to a novel approach for the study of nuclei at large deformations as described below .",
    "the brs associated with eb combines as essential elements two large - area ( with a solid angle of 187 msr each ) heavy - ion gas - detector telescopes in a kinematical coincidence setup at forward angles .",
    "a schematic lay - out of the actual experimental set - up of the brs with eb is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the two telescope arms are mounted symmetrically on either side of the beam axis , each covering the forward scattering angle range 12.5@xmath18 - 45.5@xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 = 29@xmath18 @xmath20 16.5@xmath18 . for this reason",
    "the 30 tapered ge detectors of eb  @xcite were removed .",
    "2 illustrates a typical example of a two - dimensional angle versus energy spectrum for the @xmath7o+@xmath6ne exit - channel .",
    "the six regions labelled i to vi have been defined as a function of the inelasticity of the reaction channel from the ground - state q - value e@xmath17 = 0 ( quasi - elastic ) to full damping with e@xmath17 larger than 12 mev ( orbiting deep - inelastic ) .",
    "the properties of this @xmath1-transfer channel will be further discussed thereafter .",
    "figs .  3 and 4 display the doppler - shift corrected @xmath0-ray spectra for events in coincidence with z=8 and z=10 gates defined in the bp vs e spectra as well as gates on fig .",
    "2 . most of the known transitions of both @xmath7o and @xmath6ne can be identified in the energy range depicted .",
    "the six different excitation energy gates displayed in fig .  2 are used to generate the @xmath0-ray spectra shown in fig .",
    "3 ( low - energy transitions ) . the @xmath0-ray spectrum of fig .",
    "4 was triggered with the use of the gate labelled iv .",
    "identifications of the most intense @xmath0 rays in @xmath6ne is straightforward and their labelling are given in fig .",
    "3 . as expected , we observe decays feeding the yrast line of the @xmath6ne nucleus .",
    "two previously unobserved transitions in @xmath7o from the decay of the 3@xmath21 state at 11.09  mev are clearly visible in the @xmath0-ray spectrum of fig .",
    "4 , have been identified for the first time in fig .",
    "4 ( inset ) for new the partial level scheme .",
    "we note that , thanks to the excellent resolving power of the eb+brs set - up , the respective first escape peak positions of the 6.13 mev , 6.92 mev and 7.12 mev @xmath0-ray transitions in @xmath7o are also apparent in this spectrum .    with appropriate doppler - shift corrections applied to oxygen fragments identified in the brs ,",
    "it has been possible to extend the knowledge of the level scheme of @xmath7o at high energies  @xcite , well above the @xmath3c+@xmath1 threshold , which is given in fig .  4 for the sake of comparison .",
    "new information has been deduced on branching ratios of the decay of the 3@xmath21 state of @xmath7o at 11.085  mev @xmath20 3 kev ( which does not @xmath1-decay because of non - natural parity @xcite , in contrast to the two neighbouring 4@xmath21 states at 10.36  mev and 11.10  mev , respectively ) to the 2@xmath21 state at 6.92  mev ( 54.6 @xmath20 2 @xmath22 ) and a value for the decay width @xmath23 fifty times lower than the one given in the literature @xcite , it means @xmath24 @xmath25 0.23 ev .",
    "this result is important as it is the highest known @xmath0-decaying level for the well studied @xmath7o nucleus @xcite .",
    "the connection of @xmath1-clustering , quasimolecular resonances , orbiting phenomena and extreme deformations ( sd , hd , ... ) can be discussed in terms of the aspects of @xmath0-ray spectroscopy of binary fragments from either inelastic excitations and direct transfers ( with small energy damping and spin transfer ) or from orbiting ( fully damped ) processes @xcite .",
    "exclusive data were collected with the binary reaction spetrometer ( brs ) in coincidence with euroball  iv installed at the vivitron tandem facility of strasbourg .",
    "new @xmath0-ray spectroscopy results on @xmath7o from the direct alpha transfer reactions has been presented in this work .",
    "the search for extremely elongated configurations ( hd ) in rapidly rotating medium - mass nuclei , which has been pursued exclusively using @xmath0-spectroscopy , will have to be performed in conjunction with charged particle spectroscopy in the near future .     we thank the staff of the vivitron for providing us with good @xmath2 mg stable beams and the euroball group of strasbourg for the excellent support in carrying out the experiment .",
    "this work was supported by the french in2p3/cnrs , the german ministry of research ( bmbf grant under contract nr.06-ob-900 ) , and the ec euroviv contract hpri - ct-1999 - 00078 .",
