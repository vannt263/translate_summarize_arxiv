    "the isolation of single layers of carbon atoms , in the form of graphene , resulted in the first physical realization of a true two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal leading to considerable study and revealing new physics  @xcite .",
    "the interest in graphene was not only fundamental , but also applied ; potential device applications , such as spintronic devices , of such two - dimensional materials were recognized soon after the initial discovery  @xcite .",
    "device applications of graphene are limited by its intrinsic properties , for instance the lack of a band gap , and the search for 2d crystals soon extended to other materials .",
    "spintronics requires semiconductors that possess ferromagnetic properties , particularly those that can be manipulated into one- or two - dimensional forms , so much work has focused on dilute magnetic semiconductors  @xcite , which offer a large range of magnetic properties .",
    "these compounds have been the subject of much debate since their properties are highly dependent on epitaxial growth conditions , dopant distributions and even how the dopants are incorporated into the overall band structure  @xcite . in an effort to overcome these limitations ,",

    "the compound crsite@xmath0 belongs to this class , having an electronic band gap of 0.38  mev and a ferromagnetic transition at t@xmath1  =  33  k.    much of the recent work on crsite@xmath0 has been in the form of theoretical calculations focused on the band structure and semiconducting properties , particularly calculations of the monolayer properties .",
    "generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) calculations on bulk crsite@xmath0 have calculated a bulk band gap of 0.6  mev , close to the experimental value , with the gap formed by the splitting of the cr and te levels  @xcite .",
    "these calculations correctly predict a ferromagnetic ground state that induces a slight spin polarization in the si and te atoms  @xcite .",
    "when the spins were assumed to be ising - like and aligned along the @xmath2-axis , local density approximation ( lda ) calculations predicted a nearest - neighbor exchange @xmath4  =  -0.58  mev and transition temperature t@xmath1  =  23  k  @xcite .",

    "previous neutron measurements also found a magnetic transition at 32.1  k corresponding to the cr@xmath5 moments ordering ferromagnetically along the @xmath2-axis  @xcite .",
    "these measurements found a spin gap of nearly 6  mev , which was taken as evidence for ising behavior .",
    "however , the inelastic measurements suffered from low statistics , which casts doubt on the accuracy of the determined magnetic dynamics . additionally , they do not measure in multiple brillouin zones , making it possible that they have misidentified phonon modes as magnons .",
    "this offers an explanation as to why their measurements find three spin wave branches , a conclusion that is inconsistent with linear spin wave theory based on the known magnetic structure .",
    "additionally , the claim that the spins are ising - like can not be conclusively derived from these measurements for the same reason . other experimental work cited in that work does not contain evidence of ising spins , since the cited magnetostriction measurements  @xcite are only dependent on the exchange anisotropy , while measurements of the single - ion anisotropy show it to be quite small  @xcite .",
    "finally , the behavior of the magnetic correlations above t@xmath1 were only discussed qualitatively , leaving much room for a more accurate neutron scattering study to determine the magnetic correlations .",

    "this is close to the value expected for a two dimensional transition ( @xmath23  =  0.125 ) , and well below the values expected for a three dimensional transition ( @xmath24  =  0.326 and @xmath25  =  0.367 ) .",
    "the low value of critical exponent is likely a consequence of strong two - dimensional correlations in this material .",
    "the long - range order below 33.2  k is , however , three - dimensional in nature , with the spins aligned ferromagnetically along the @xmath2-axis direction .",
    "this was confirmed by measuring 39 magnetic peaks in the [ @xmath20  0  @xmath21 scattering plane , whose intensities below t@xmath1 were consistent with @xmath2-axis ordering .",

    "in addition to the magnetic diffraction peaks that emerge below t@xmath1 , diffuse scattering develops around the bragg peaks , with an intensity that has a maximum at t@xmath1 , shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ hb3](a ) .",
    "this diffuse scattering arises due to the in - plane correlations that are present , particularly above the ordering temperature . in order to study the magnetic correlations within the @xmath3-plane as a function of temperature",
    ", a series of two - axis measurements were performed on the hb-3 instrument .",
    "this was done by measuring along @xmath20 about the wavevector ( 1  0  0.545 ) , chosen such that the @xmath2-axis was parallel to the final neutron wavevector , @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the analyzer was then removed to integrate over various momentum transfers , but the @xmath27 orientation means that the component of the momentum transfer that varies with final energy is constrained to be along the @xmath28-direction .",
    "this provides an accurate measure of the energy - integrated spin response for two - dimensional correlations within the @xmath3-plane .",
    "the two - axis measurements are peaked at @xmath20  =  1 for all temperatures measured and we find that the peak intensity is largest at t@xmath1 , which is shown in the inset to fig .",

    "this experiment did not have the required temperature stability or density of data points near t@xmath1 to perform an accurate measurement of the critical exponent , @xmath29 , or to observe the expected 2d to 3d crossover , which typically occurs within 0.01% to 0.1% of t@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "however , we do observe that the correlation length remains larger than the nearest - neighbor distance at all temperatures measured , up to 250  k. this suggests that short - range correlations between the moments in the @xmath3-plane exist well above the ordering transition .",
    "fig .  [ combined](a ) and ( c ) show the spin wave dispersions measured on the sequoia spectrometer , with an incident energy e@xmath30  =  30  mev .",

    "this shows that the dispersion is very weak along the @xmath2-axis , and that the minimum in the spin wave dispersion is below 1  mev at the zone center , ( 0  0  -3 ) .",
    "since the dispersion along @xmath28 is relatively weak , it was observed that varying the integration range along @xmath28 had little effect on the plot of the spin wave spectrum .",
    "therefore , the spectrum shown in fig .  [ combined](a ) was constructed by integrating over the full @xmath28-range , @xmath32 , while using an integration range of 0.2  r.l.u .",

    "the data along ( @xmath20  0  0 ) using a smaller integration range for @xmath28 showed identical dispersions , supporting the conclusion that the spin waves are close to two - dimensional .",

    "this is consistent with magnetization data taken to characterize the sample , which observes very little magnetic hysteresis and a field of 1.5  t applied in the @xmath3-plane ( the hard magnetization direction ) is required to saturate the magnetic moment .",
    "additionally , dft calculations based on purely van  der  waals interactions have found that there is an entropy difference of @xmath7  20  @xmath35ev , favoring @xmath2-axis ordering , as compared to ordering within the @xmath3-plane  @xcite .",

    "the single - ion anisotropy arises from the small @xmath2-axis distortion in the te octahedra surrounding the cr@xmath5 ions .",
