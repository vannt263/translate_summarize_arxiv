    "the diffraction measure is a characteristic quantity of a translation bounded measure @xmath0 on euclidean space ( or on any locally compact abelian group ) .",
    "it emerges as the fourier transform @xmath1 of the autocorrelation measure @xmath2 of @xmath0 , and has important applications in crystallography , because it describes the outcome of kinematic diffraction ( from x - rays or neutron scattering , say ) . in recent years ,",
    "initiated by the discovery of quasicrystals ( which are non - periodic but nevertheless show pure bragg diffraction ) , a systematic study by many people has produced a reasonably satisfactory understanding of the class of measures with a pure point diffraction measure , meaning that @xmath1 is a pure point measure , without any continuous component .    clearly , reality is more complicated than that , in the sense that real world structures will ( and do ) show lots of continuous components as well .",
    "unfortunately , the methods around dynamical systems that are used to establish pure point spectra do not seem to extend to the treatment of systems with mixed spectrum , at least not in sufficient generality .",
    "nevertheless , systems with continuous spectral components have recently been investigated also from a rigorous mathematical point of view , with a number of unexpected results .",
    "in particular , the phenomenon of homometry becomes more subtle , as we will see below .    in this informal exposition ,",
    "we summarise some classic results that have recently resurfaced in the context of diffraction , with special emphasis on singular continuous and absolutely continuous spectra . for proofs ( and the formal details ) we refer to the original papers or to work in progress .",
    "below , we mainly consider various ( weighted ) dirac combs on the real line , with support on @xmath3 ( the set of integers ) , and their diffraction . even in this simple and seemingly restricted",
    "setting , unexpected phenomena show up . if @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the normalised point measure at @xmath6 , the _ natural autocorrelation _ ( if it exists ) of @xmath0 is @xmath7 which we view as a measure on @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 $ ] , and @xmath10 is the ` flipped over ' measure , defined by @xmath11 with @xmath12 a continuous test function of compact support and @xmath13 . here , and in analogous situations below , the bar denotes complex conjugation .",
    "we will only consider situations where the limit in exists , either always ( in the deterministic cases ) or almost surely ( in the probabilistic cases ) .",
    "an explicit calculation shows that @xmath14 implies that @xmath2 must be of the form @xmath15 with the autocorrelation coefficients @xmath16 the existence of the limit in is equivalent to the existence of the @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .    by construction",
    ", @xmath2 is a positive definite measure , and hence fourier transformable .",
    "the result is @xmath1 , the _ diffraction measure _ , which is a positive , translation bounded measure on @xmath8 .",
    "it describes ( kinematic ) diffraction from the measure @xmath0 ; compare @xcite for background and @xcite for the development of this approach to diffraction theory .",
    "one of the benefits of this approach is the unique decomposition @xmath19 of the diffraction measure into its pure point , singular continuous and absolutely continuous parts , the latter splitting relative to lebesgue measure @xmath20 , which is the natural reference measure for volume in euclidean space .",
    "the best known example is the lattice dirac comb @xmath21 , with autocorrelation @xmath22 and diffraction @xmath23 . here",
    ", @xmath2 follows from an elementary calculation , while the formula for @xmath1 is a consequence of the _ poisson summation formula _",
    "@xmath24 for an arbitrary lattice @xmath25 ( in @xmath26 ) of density @xmath27 , with dual lattice @xmath28 , the latter defined by @xmath29 ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the integer lattice is perhaps the simplest example for a system with pure point diffraction .",
    "more generally , if @xmath0 is any @xmath3-periodic measure , it can be written as @xmath30 , with @xmath31 a finite measure .",
    "this leads to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a continuous positive function on @xmath8 .",
    "its values at integer points are the _ intensities _ of the bragg peaks .",
    "a similarly nice formula formula holds for regular model sets . within a given cut and project scheme ( cps ) @xmath35 with lattice @xmath36 ,",
    "consider @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the projection of @xmath39 in @xmath26 , @xmath40 is the ( compact ) window in @xmath41 ( with boundary of measure @xmath42 ) , and @xmath43 denotes the star map of the cps . by the general model set theorem @xcite ,",
    "the diffraction @xmath1 of the dirac comb @xmath44 is then the pure point measure @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the projection of the dual lattice @xmath47 and the amplitude @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 this formula has various generalisations , for instance to model sets with other internal spaces or to weighted model sets ; see @xcite and references therein for more .    as an example",
    ", we consider the _ period doubling sequence _ , as defined by the substitution @xmath50 a two - sided sequence can be obtained from a fixed point of @xmath51 via the iteration @xmath52 with convergence in the ( obvious ) product topology . here and below ,",
    "we write two - sided sequences as @xmath53 and use @xmath54 to mark the origin .",
    "note that @xmath55 in is a legal seed , so that @xmath56 is a fixed point of @xmath51 in the strict sense .",
    "we attach a dirac comb to @xmath56 by @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this turns out to define a ( weighted ) regular model set @xcite , so that the diffraction is indeed a pure point measure .",
    "it is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fourier module of the period doubling sequence .",
    "the amplitudes read @xmath62 where we implicitly refer to the parametrisation of @xmath63 .",
    "we state this formula here without further details ; see @xcite for a proof .",
    "let us briefly mention the _",
    "homometry _ problem .",
    "it refers to the possibility that distinct measures can still possess the same autocorrelation .",
    "an interesting example is constructed in @xcite , based on @xmath64-periodic dirac combs of the form @xmath65 .",
    "in particular , the two choices of table  [ tab : gm ] lead to the same autocorrelation  and , in fact , even to identical correlation functions up to order @xmath66 .",
    "it is only the order @xmath64 correlation that tells the two combs apart .",
    "ccccccc @xmath67 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 + @xmath68 & 11 & 25 & 42 & 45 & 31 & 14 + @xmath68 & 10 & 21 & 39 & 46 & 35 & 17 +    for model sets , there are further possibilities , because different windows can have the same covariogram .",
    "the latter ( for a compact set @xmath69 ) is defined as @xmath70 .",
    "this phenomenon results in identical autocorrelations and hence in homometric model sets .",
    "a simple planar example was constructed in @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "we skip further details here and shift our attention to continuous spectra now .",
    "the paradigm of a singular continuous measure is the distribution function for the classic middle - thirds cantor measure , which is also called the devil s staircase . here",
    ", we show a class of structures that lead to somewhat similar functions , yet with significant differences .",
    "the classic thue - morse ( or prouhet - thue - morse ) sequence @xcite can be defined via a fixed point of the substitution @xmath71 on the binary alphabet @xmath72 .",
    "the one - sided fixed point starting with @xmath73 reads @xmath74 while @xmath75 is the fixed point starting with @xmath76 .",
    "one can now define a two - sided sequence @xmath56 by @xmath77 it is easy to check that @xmath56 defines a @xmath78-cycle under @xmath79 , and hence a fixed point for @xmath51 .",
    "since the central seed @xmath80 is legal , an iteration of @xmath51 applied to it converges to @xmath56 in the product topology .",
    "the sequence @xmath56 defines a dynamical system ( under the action of the group @xmath3 ) .",
    "its compact space is the ( discrete ) _ hull _ , obtained as the closure of the @xmath3-orbit of @xmath56 , @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the shift operator and the closure is taken in the local ( or product ) topology , where two sequences are close when they agree on a large segment around the origin .",
    "now , @xmath83 is a strictly ergodic dynamical system ( hence uniquely ergodic and minimal @xcite ) .",
    "its unique invariant probability measure is given via the ( absolute ) frequencies of finite words ( or patches ) as the measures of the corresponding cylinder sets , which then generate the @xmath84-algebra .    here , we are interested in the diffraction of the ( signed ) dirac comb @xmath85 , where we interpret @xmath73 and @xmath76 as weights @xmath73 and @xmath86 .",
    "its autocorrelation exists , as a consequence of unique ergodicity , and is actually the same measure for _ all _ sequences of @xmath87 .",
    "we can now employ the special structure of our fixed point @xmath56 to analyse it .",
    "the autocorrelation is of the general form , with coefficients @xmath88 , @xmath89 for all @xmath18 and @xmath90 for all @xmath91 . here",
    ", the structure of @xmath56 and its relation to @xmath92 was used to derive from . observing that @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 and @xmath94 for all @xmath95",
    ", one can derive from the recursions @xmath96 which actually hold for all @xmath18 .",
    "one finds @xmath97 from solving the recursion for @xmath98 and @xmath99 with @xmath100 , while all other values are then recursively determined .    to analyse the diffraction measure @xmath1 of the tm sequence ( following @xcite ) , one can start with its pure point part .",
    "defining @xmath101 , one derives via the recursion that @xmath102 , which implies @xmath103 . by wiener",
    "s criterion @xcite , this means @xmath104 , so that @xmath1 is a continuous measure .    defining the ( continuous ) distribution function @xmath105 via @xmath106\\bigr)$ ] , another consequence of is the pair of functional relations @xmath107 splitting @xmath105 into its and parts ( which is unique ) now implies backwards that the recursion holds separately for the two sets of autocorrelation coefficients , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , with yet unknown initial conditions at @xmath42 .",
    "an application of the riemann - lebesgue lemma , however , forces @xmath110 , and hence @xmath111 for all @xmath18 , so that also @xmath112 ; compare @xcite .",
    "this shows that @xmath1 , which is not the zero measure , is purely singular continuous .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows an image , where we have used the volterra iteration @xmath113 to calculate @xmath105 with sufficient precision ( note that @xmath114 , so that a display on @xmath115 $ ] suffices ) .",
    "in contrast to the devil s staircase , the tm function is _ strictly _ increasing , which means that there is no plateau ( which would indicate a gap in the support of @xmath1 ) ; see @xcite and references therein for details .",
    "the distribution function of the tm measure on @xmath115$].,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    despite the above result , the tm sequence is closely related to the period doubling sequence , via the ( continuous ) block map @xmath116 which defines an exact 2-to-1 surjection from the hull @xmath87 to @xmath117 .",
    "the tm sequence is often considered as a rare and special example , which is misleading . to demonstrate the point ( following @xcite ) ,",
    "consider the generalised morse sequences defined by @xmath118 for arbitrary @xmath119 . here , the one - sided fixed point starting with @xmath120 satisfies @xmath121 for @xmath91 .",
    "a two - sided sequence can be constructed as above . since each choice of @xmath122 leads to a strictly ergodic dynamical system , we know that all autocorrelation coefficients exist . clearly ( again with @xmath123 ) , we have @xmath100 , while several possibilities exist to calculate @xmath124 .",
    "in general , we obtain the recursion @xmath125 with @xmath126 , which holds for all @xmath18 and @xmath127 .",
    "the recursion can once again be used to show the absence of pure point components ( by wiener s criterion ) as well as that of absolutely continuous components ( by the riemann - lebesgue lemma ) , thus establishing that each sequence in this family leads to a signed dirac comb with purely singular continuous diffraction .",
    "the distribution function satisfies @xmath128 \\bigr ) =      x + \\sum_{m\\ge 1 } \\frac{\\eta(m)}{m\\pi } { \\hspace{0.5pt}}\\sin ( 2\\pi m x ) { \\hspace{0.5pt}},\\ ] ] which is a uniformly converging series .",
    "moreover , the measure @xmath1 has a ( vaguely convergent ) representation as an infinite _ riesz product _ :  with @xmath129 , it is given by @xmath130 .",
    "the entire analysis is thus completely analogous to that of the original tm sequence and shows that the latter is a typical example in an infinite family .",
    "further details ( and proofs ) will be given in @xcite .",
    "let us finally mention that the block map applies to any member of this family , and always gives a 2-to-1 cover of the hull that belongs to the generalised period doubling substitution @xmath131 since we always have a coincidence in the sense of dekking @xcite , they all define systems with pure point spectrum  another analogy to the classic case @xmath132 .",
    "the simplest example in this category is the bernoulli ( or coin tossing ) comb .",
    "let @xmath133 be a family of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables .",
    "we assume that @xmath40 represents this family and takes values @xmath73 and @xmath86 with probabilities @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we then consider the random measure @xmath136 which ( almost surely in the probabilistic sense ) has a natural autocorrelation of the form , with coefficients @xmath137 and ( a.s . ) @xmath138 for all @xmath139 , so that we have @xmath140 in particular , when @xmath141 , it gives @xmath142 .",
    "eq .   can be proved either by an application of birkhoff s ergodic theorem for @xmath3-action or by the strong law of large numbers ( slln ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details and further references .",
    "let us also mention that can be rewritten as @xmath143 , where @xmath144 has the meaning of the drift velocity of a one - dimensional random walk on the line ; compare @xcite .    as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain a diffraction measure of mixed type , @xmath145 where @xmath20 denotes lebesgue measure .",
    "the special case of a fair coin ( @xmath141 ) leads to @xmath146 , which is purely absolutely continuous . more generally , when @xmath40 takes the ( possibly complex ) values @xmath147 and @xmath148 , each with probability @xmath149 , one obtains @xmath150 which is another simple example of a mixed spectrum with pure point and absolutely continuous components .",
    "an interesting deterministic counterpart is the _ rudin - shapiro sequence _ @xcite .",
    "its quaternary version is usually defined by the substitution @xmath151 a fixed point @xmath152 can be constructed from the legal seed @xmath153 via iteration of @xmath51 .",
    "the _ binary _ version follows then as the reduction @xmath154 with the mapping @xmath155 given by @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the two - sided sequence @xmath56 satisfies @xmath158 and @xmath159 together with the recursion @xmath160 for all @xmath161 . the sequence @xmath56 and its hull",
    "once again define a strictly ergodic dynamical system , so that the natural autocorrelation @xmath162 exists and is the same for all members of the hull .",
    "it is of the general form . to calculate it",
    ", one needs a little trick .",
    "define the coefficients @xmath163 for @xmath18 .",
    "note that all these limits exist , by birkhoff s ergodic theorem ( this is immediately clear for @xmath17 , but also follows for @xmath164 on the basis of the quarternary sequence @xmath165 , which also gives rise to a strictly ergodic system ) ; compare @xcite for an alternative approach .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath100 and @xmath166 , while a slightly more involved calculation reveals the following coupled system of recursions , @xmath167 together with @xmath168 these equations are valid for all @xmath18 . extracting @xmath169 from the last two equations ( with @xmath98 resp.@xmath99 ) , one can then recursively conclude that @xmath170 for all @xmath18 and @xmath171 for all @xmath172 .",
    "this shows @xmath173 in particular , the ( deterministic ) diffraction of the binary rs sequence is the same as the ( almost sure ) diffraction of the coin tossing sequence for @xmath141 , despite the fact that their entropies are different ( @xmath42 versus @xmath174 ) ; see @xcite for further details .",
    "the situation is actually ` worse ' in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath175 be a two - sided sequence , assumed ergodic , with associated dirac comb @xmath176 and autocorrelation @xmath177 .",
    "the latter exists due to the ergodicity assumption .",
    "let @xmath178 be the above family of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with values in @xmath179 .",
    "consider now the new random dirac comb @xmath180 which we call the _ bernoullisation _ of the original sequence .",
    "it can be considered as a ` randomisation via second thoughts ' , since the action of the @xmath181 is to either keep @xmath182 ( with probability @xmath134 ) or to change its sign ( with probability @xmath135 ) . by another ( slightly more complicated ) application of the slln",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath183 together with the corresponding almost sure diffraction @xmath184 .",
    "if @xmath82 is the binary rs sequence from above , one finds @xmath185 and @xmath186 , _ independently _ of the parameter @xmath134 .",
    "this proves that the entire family defined by for the rs sequence is homometric , with the entropy varying continuously between @xmath42 and @xmath187 ; compare @xcite for the connection between diffraction and entropy in the pure point case .",
    "the diffraction measure is a useful tool , both for the understanding of experiments and for various theoretical questions . beyond the well - studied case of pure point spectra ,",
    "also continuous spectra are explicitly accessible and sometimes ( as above ) even computable .",
    "however , as was to be expected , various aspects are more involved , and this includes the inverse problem .",
    "the latter is increasing in complexity also with growing dimension .",
    "for instance , the ledrappier system @xcite in the plane has the same autocorrelation as the bernoulli comb ( both living on @xmath188 ) , but has rank-@xmath73 entropy despite being genuinely two - dimensional .",
    "various generalisations exist to non - lattice systems , which are best formulated via the theory of point processes @xcite . here , the classic poisson process ( of mean point density @xmath73 ) is another example ( with random positions ) that gives diffraction measure @xmath20 when the points are randomly weighted with @xmath73 and @xmath86 .",
    "it is clear that higher order correlations can tell these systems apart , but many questions are still open .",
    "finally , more realistic models of randomness have to include interactions .",
    "the theory of gibbs measures is a necessary and useful tool here , but only first steps in this direction have been taken ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "our present day understanding is still rather limited .",
