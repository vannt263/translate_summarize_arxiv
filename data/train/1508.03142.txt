    "<S> phase - sensitive properties of light play a crucial role in a variety of quantum optical phenomena , which have been mostly discussed in the framework of photoelectric detection theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , modern detection schemes , such as arrays of on - off detectors , are not based on photoelectric counting . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the theory of homodyning with such click counting detectors can be established by using a proper detection model . for practical applications , a variety of typically occurring imperfections </S>",
    "<S> are rigorously analyzed and directly observable nonclassicality criteria are studied . </S>",
    "<S> fundamental examples demonstrate the general functionality of our technique . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our approach of homodyne detection with on - off detector systems is able to bridge the gap between imperfect detection and the phase resolution demands for modern applications of quantum light . </S>"
