    "self  assembly is prominent phenomena that is frequently being exploited to design patterns in variety of soft matter applications at a wide range of scales , examples of which include active layers in organic photovoltaics  @xcite , membranes in fuel cells  @xcite , and multi - component fluids , such as surfactant or polymer based emulsions and micro - emulsions  @xcite .",
    "unlike self  organization in systems that are driven far from thermal equilibrium , such as reaction diffusion media , self - assembly models are variational , i.e. , systems that are characterized by energy decrease over time .",
    "the phenomenology of self  assembly is well described by two prototypical mean field models : the cahn  hilliard theory for phase separation and crystal phase field for formation patterns with a characteristic spatial scale  @xcite .",
    "however , both frameworks rely on local interactions and neglect the impact of long - range coulombic forces . the latter , however , are inherently present in a wide range of chemical mixtures , examples of which include polyelectrolytes , inverse micelles and colloids , di - block copolymers , and ionic liquids , see  @xcite and the references therein",
    ".    motivated by self  assembly in polymeric compositions ohta and kawasaki ( ok ) have suggested a framework that incorporates both the short and the long  range interactions  @xcite ; the ok equation is also often referred to as the non  local cahn ",
    "hilliard approach .",
    "to date , not only that the ok model is being frequently employed for studies of polymers  @xcite , but also has been recently suggested as basis for a general theory for morphology development driven by competing short - range , and long - range nonlocal interactions @xcite . in the current form , however , the model does not account for symmetry breaking properties of the coexisting phases , such as asymmetry in the double well potential and permittivity . in",
    "what follows , we study an extended version of the ok model and specifically investigate the emergence of spatially localized solutions , having properties as reviewed in  @xcite and the references therein .    while in the ok context most studies and applications focused on the properties of spatially periodic patterns and",
    "have described a rich variety of patterns  @xcite , spatially localized patterns such as isolated stripes ( e.g.t , wires ) , are significant for integrated circuits as nano scales  @xcite . to date , such wires are being generated via polymer lithography , however , not only that the latter methods are cumbersome and expansive , stability is also a notorious issue  @xcite .",
    "it would be thus plausible to induce a stable localized self  assembly from a single perturbation as an alternative to multi ",
    "step lithography .",
    "however , theory of localized states in the context of self  assembly is missing although these attract much of interest in applications , such as nonlinear optics , self  organization of quantum dots , convection , and reaction  diffusion systems , and analysis due to the intriguing phenomena of homoclinic snaking  @xcite . specifically , while many insights have been provided via models with local interactions ( e.g. , the swift  hohenberg model  @xcite ) , the existence and stability properties of localized states under coulombic interactions are in general missing  @xcite .    here",
    "we aim to investigate the emergence of localized states in both the classical and extended ohta  kawasaki model and provide a basic understanding of their formation mechanism .",
    "the focus is on homoclinic snaking phenomena in 1d and transverse instabilities of localized stripes with a limiting discussion also on localized hexagonal stripes .",
    "the paper is structured as following : first , in section  [ sec : eok ] , we describe the ohta ",
    "kawasaki framework , then in section  [ sec : anal ] , we perform linear and weakly nonlinear analyses ( deriving the newell  whitehead  segel equation ) and show the presence of super and sub  critical bifurcations .",
    "thirdly , we study in section  [ sec : loc ] the properties of spatially localized states in 1d and 2d , and finally discuss the results by focusing on the not - slanted snaking properties as could have been expected from analyses of conserved systems without coulombic interactions  @xcite .",
    "the competition between short and long  ranged coulomb forces can be introduced by considering a mixture of two immiscible and counter - charged phases that incorporate repelling and attractive interactions , respectively .",

    "the second impact of the finite domain effect is related to branch termination , which happens to be on a periodic solution after the domain gets filled by peaks  @xcite . however , unlike typical behavior in dissipative models  @xcite , here the branch terminates at a distinct periodic solution , to which we refer as @xmath153 , as shown in figure  [ fig : snaking_ok ] .    in general , insights to formation and properties of the snaking region exploit the presence of conserved quantities ( excluding reaction ",

    "self  assembly of spatially localized states in one- and two - space dimensions has been studied in a context of electrically charged and mass conserved media ( i.e. , a system which exhibits both short and long range interactions ) . as a case study system ,",
    "we focus on the ohta - kawasaki framework which incorporates , in addition , difference in the properties of the charged domains and non - uniform permittivity . while the ok model has been studied extensively in the context of spatially extended patterns that arise through super ",
    "critical bifurcations , it is the sub ",
    "critical bifurcations that give rise to a rich behavior of localized states .",
    "although the ok system is conservative , the self  assembly behaves differently than typical phase field model ( a.k.a .",
    "conserved swift - hohenberg )  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the ok system obeys the linear stability properties ( dispersion relation ) of dissipative systems , such as swift - hohenberg  @xcite and gierer - meinhardt  @xcite and the formed localized states in 1d create a vertical ( in contrast to slanted , as in  @xcite ) homoclinic snaking structure that corresponds to heteroclinic cycles linking uniform and periodic solutions .",
    "the reason for the distinct behavior is attributed to the coupling with non  local interactions that precludes unique chemical potential for both the mass and the electrical field . without the electrical field ,",
    "any change in the model control parameter corresponds to a respective change in chemical potential  @xcite , which leads in turn to slanted snaking .",
    "although the eok model also posses the property of energy minimization under mass constraint , the first variation of the energy depends also on the solution of poisson s equation  . however , the latter is not unique under neumann boundary conditions and sets a degree of freedom in setting one of the lagrange multipliers , see   and the appendix .",
    "consequenly , vertical snaking can form without violation of thermodynamic principles .    the impact of coulombic interactions is reflected also in the asymptotic analysis and the form of the amplitude equations : poissons equation   is solvable only when @xmath212",
    ". therefore mass of eok   solutions can not be arbitrarily determined via the initial condition , as occurs , for example in csh  @xcite .",
    "the arbitrary choice of mass in csh , is reflected in the dispersion relation via the ever neutrality of @xmath213  @xcite , different from the eok model   where @xmath214 , see figure [ fig : disper ] .",
    "coupling to @xmath215 results in two coupled amplitude equations with nonlocal properties  @xcite .",
    "consequently , our study gives rise to a counter - intuitive picture that while conservation in local equations leads to non - local effects in the amplitude equations , in our case coupling to non - locality leads to local effects in the amplitude equations , bearing similarity to dissipative systems  @xcite .",
    "localized stripes which are the natural extension in 2d have been also investigated .",
    "we found distinct instability types associated with spatially extended eigenfunctions ( body modes ) and localized eigenfunctions ( wall and body ",
    "localized modes )  @xcite , as demonstrated in figures  [ fig : ti ] and  [ fig : fc ] .",
    "specifically , the instability via localized eigenfunctions leads to localized spots while body eigenfunctions lead to stripes embedded in a hexagonal background ; stability of stripes to body modes persists over a larger domain as compared with the localized modes ( see figure  [ fig : fc_ly ] ) . in a more general context ,",
    "localized pattern formation in the vicinity of maxwell points , e.g. , an energy equivalence between periodic and uniform states , allows to interpret existing phase maps in 2d or 3d to map possible localized structures in high - dimensions and thus applications .",
    "for example , the phase diagram devised for the ok equation  @xcite , discloses an interface between stable periodic spots and strips . at the interface",
    ", the two states should presumably have the same energy and therefore , it is likely that localized strips on a spotted background would also coexist .",
    "on the other hand , in the absence of interface between stable stripes and uniform ( disordered ) states , it is unlikely that localized strips would be present .",
    "indeed , both observations are consistent with our results . to this end , we believe that insights into the localized self  assembly mechanism developed here for conserved and charge systems , can be exploited to design by simple means , low cost isolated morphologies that can be attractive for example , to nano electronics  @xcite .",
