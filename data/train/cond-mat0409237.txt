    "there appear growing interests in the self - organization phenomena of conduction electrons , known as charge inhomogeneity .",
    "a prime example is the high - temperature superconducting copper oxides , in which the nano - scale phase - separation of doped carriers is observed in scanning - tunnel - microscope experiments @xcite .",
    "another example is the charge order ( co ) in the transition - metal oxides @xcite , where spins and holes are alternately aligned to form a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order and a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order simultaneously .",
    "these have been regarded as a new aspect of strongly correlated electron systems , because the electrons tend to be self - organized in order to minimize the magnetic energy of the background spins .",
    "thus we expect that such a self - organization will happen regardless of the degrees of disorder , and call it `` intrinsic inhomogeneity '' . in real materials , however , disorder - driven effects can not be ruled out , owing to unavoidable solid solutions and defects .",
    "but rather , there increase a number of papers reporting that the charge order is quite susceptible to disorder @xcite .",
    "thus , to search for intrinsic charge inhomogeneity , we need a charge - ordered system in a very clean solid .",
    "organic salts are a good candidate for the clean system .",
    "they are grown in organic solvent at room temperature , where the thermal energy is small enough to suppress point defects .",
    "actually most of the metallic salts exhibit the shubnikov - de haas oscillation at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "this means that the mean free path of the conduction electron is very long , and that the crystal is free from impurities .",
    "in particular , the bedt - ttf [ bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene ] salts are most suitable for the study of the strong correlation in two dimension , and the @xmath3(bedt - ttf ) salts have been most thoroughly investigated among them , where a superconductor - antiferromagnetic insulator transition takes place by changing hydrostatic pressure , anion species , and deuterium substitution @xcite .",
    "@xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath4zn(scn)@xmath2 ( @xmath5rb and cs ) is another interesting family of the bedt - ttf salts @xcite , where the bedt - ttf molecules form a distorted triangular lattice .",
    "the bedt - ttf layer acts as a two - dimensional conducting layer , and owing to the triangular stacking , a single elliptic fermi surface is calculated in the tight - binding approximation .",
    "this makes a remarkable contrast with the @xmath3type salts , in which the bedt - ttf molecules form a dimer to make two fermi surfaces ( the electron pocket and the one - dimensional sheet ) . in this sense ,",
    "the @xmath0type salts are a truly two - dimensional system with a moderate in - plane anisotropy .",
    "another feature is that they are quarter - filled ( one hole for the two bedt - ttf molecules ) , which means that the system is far from the mott transition that occurs near half - filling @xcite .",
    "the most interesting feature is that they are unstable against co along the @xmath6 axis @xcite .",
    "a metal - insulator transition due to co occurs at @xmath7190 k for @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1rbzn(scn)@xmath2 ( the @xmath5rb salt ) @xcite .",
    "the dielectric constant is a good probe for the charge inhomogeneity .",
    "we have studied the dielectric response of strongly correlated systems , and have found a large dielectric constant above @xmath8 for the @xmath5rb salt @xcite . the frequency dependence is quantitatively explained in terms of a generalized formula of debye s dielectric relaxation , which strongly suggests that fractions of co already exist even at room temperature .",
    "such a picture is consistent with other measurements such as nmr @xcite and optical reflectivity @xcite .",
    "this is a piece of evidence that the charge inhomogeneity can occur in a homogeneous system . in this paper",
    ", we report on the dielectric response and the nonlinear conductivity of @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cszn(scn)@xmath2 ( the @xmath5cs salt ) single crystals .",
    "we have found anomalously large nonlinear conductivity just like the sliding of cdw , although there is no sign for cdw / sdw transitions at all temperatures .",
    "this implies that the @xmath5cs salt exhibits _ a collective excitation without long range order_.",
    "single crystals with a typical dimension of 2@xmath90.2@xmath90.2 mm@xmath10 were prepared using a galvanostatic anodic oxidation method , and the detailed growth conditions and their characterization were described in @xcite .",
    "the resistivity was measured by a four - probe and two - probe method from 4.2 to 300 k in a liquid he cryostat .",
    "the contact resistance was 10 - 50 @xmath11 at room temperature .",
    "thus the resistivity obtained by the two - probe method was accurate within an error bar of 1% at all the temperatures for the out - of - plane direction ( the @xmath12-axis direction ) , and below 10 k for the in - plane direction ( the @xmath13-axis direction ) .",
    "the dielectric constant ( @xmath14 ) and ac conductivity ( @xmath15 ) along the out - of - plane direction ( the @xmath12 direction ) were measured with a parallel plate capacitor arrangement using an ac two - contact four - probe method with an lcr meter ( agilent 4284a , and 4286a ) from 10@xmath10 to 10@xmath16 hz .",
    "the dc - bias dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath15 was also measured in the static dc voltage .",
    "the in - plane dielectric constant was not measured , because it had too low resistance for us to measure @xmath17 precisely .",
    "owing to the two - contact configuration , the contact resistance and capacitance might have affected the measurement .",
    "as mentioned , the contact resistance was negligible along the out - of - plane direction , which was verified by the fact that the observed @xmath18 was quantitatively consistent with the observed dc resistivity for @xmath19 .",
    "though we did not evaluate the contact capacitance , we can employ an evaluated value of 500 pf for la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 from ref .",

    "we should emphasize that an artifact such as heating can not cause the abrupt jump with the significant hysteresis .",
    "we took the data with the sample immersed in liquid @xmath21he , and carefully evaluated the joule heating to be a few @xmath47w at the threshold , which is much smaller than a cooling power of liquid @xmath21he ( typically more than 1w ) .",
    "we should further note that a preliminary measurement using a pulse voltage technique gives identical i - v curves to those taken in static dc bias .",
    "the pulse width was changed from 2 to 50 ms with a duration time of 500 ms , and the voltage was swept from 0 to 10 v. the jump in the dc conductivity was clearly observed above 6 - 7 v , and the conductivity above @xmath46 was independent of the pulse width @xcite .",

    "the large bias dependence is clearly observed up to 20 k , which suggests that the collective excitation survives at least up to 20 k. the threshold field gradually decreases with increasing temperature , but still remains finite at 20 k. although @xmath46 is not the phase boundary , it can be a measure for a boundary between the metallic and insulating states , which extends to much higher temperatures .",
    "another notable feature is that the metallic state ( high - bias state ) has essentially temperature - independent @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in particular , @xmath15 above @xmath46 is as high as @xmath48 at 50 k.

    "it is thus reasonable to assign the giant nonlinear conduction to a _ collective _ excitaion with a coherent length scale of 1 @xmath47 m .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the large @xmath14 of the @xmath5cs salt is expressed by the dielectric relaxation .",
    "a similar @xmath17 is seen in cdw conductors such as k@xmath57moo@xmath58@xcite , in which cdw oscillates around pinning centers by an ac electric field to induce a large dielectric response .",

    "accordingly @xmath66 is equal to @xmath67 , and thus the large @xmath68 implies a large @xmath60 and/or a small @xmath61 . in the case of the pinned cdw ,",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 correspond to the drude weight ( @xmath69 ) of the order of 1 ev and the pinning potential of the order of 1 mev , respectively , which makes @xmath70 as huge as 10@xmath16 .",
    "a more precise treatment is to solve the equation of motion for the phase of the cdw order parameter @xcite , which also gives the overdamped lorentz oscillator @xcite .    from the viewpoint of charge density modulation , difference between cdw and co",
    "is very subtle : the former shows a sinusoidal - wave modulation , and the latter shows a square - wave modulation . in either case",
    ", the dielectric response can be described in terms of the overdamped lorentz oscillator .",
    "in fact , charge - ordered materials such as lufe@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite and pr@xmath71ca@xmath72mno@xmath58 @xcite show a large @xmath17 described by eq .",
    "previously we attributed the large @xmath14 of the @xmath5rb salt to the collective motion of co @xcite . an important difference from cdw conductors",
    "is that the dielectric relaxation survives in the `` normal '' state far above @xmath8 .",
    "this means that the fluctuation of the pre - formed co coexists with the unbound carriers that do not participate in co. in this sense , we can say that the electrons in the @xmath5rb salt are self - organized above @xmath8 to make its density inhomogeneous .",

    "4 is similar to the nonlinear conductivity of cdw .",
    "let us list significant differences from the nonlinear conduction of cdw .",
    "( i ) the conductivity in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) is highly nonlinear below @xmath46 , while most of the cdw conductors show an ohmic conductivity below @xmath46 .",
    "this suggests that the domain sizes and/or the pinning forces of the pre - formed co are varied widely in the @xmath5cs salt .",
    "( ii ) the cdw conductors show negligibly small nonlinear conduction above @xmath80 .",
    "thus it is quite surprising that the @xmath5cs salt exhibits the huge nonlinearity of 100 - 1000 times above @xmath8 ( @xmath81 k ) .",
    "( iii ) the observed nonlinearity is much larger than that in other two - dimensional conductors @xcite .",
    "large nonlinear conduction has been observed mostly in one - dimensional cdw conductors such as k@xmath57moo@xmath58 , nbse@xmath58 , tas@xmath58@xcite ( iv ) the nonlinear conductivity perpendicular to the charge - density modulation is observed for the first time .",
    "figure 5 shows the dc resistivity along the @xmath12 axis ( @xmath82 ) below @xmath46 plotted as a function of temperature . @xmath82 increases with decreasing temperature , the temperature dependence of which is nearly the same as that of the in - plane ( the @xmath13 axis ) resistivity ( @xmath83 ) @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the insulating state is more or less three - dimensional .",
    "the low - temperature upturn in @xmath83 has been understood in terms of variable range hopping ( vrh ) strongly localized state , but it should be emphasized here that the frequency and temperature dependences of @xmath84 and @xmath85 seriously contradict the vrh picture . in fig . 5 , @xmath86 ( 1 mhz ) for @xmath79",
    "is also plotted as a function of temperature , which is nearly the same value of @xmath82 at 60 k. this means that the @xmath5cs salt at low temperature is a `` fake '' insulator that is quite unstable against the strong electric field .",
    "wang et al . observed an anomalous increase in @xmath87 of the @xmath5cs salt in the infrared region at low temperatures , and speculated that the @xmath5cs salt is in the verge of metal - insulator transition @xcite , which might be associated with the fake insulating state .",
    "the nonlinear conduction below @xmath46 is usually weak in the cdw materials .",
    "a homogeneous cdw order has a single coherent length , and the corresponding value of @xmath46 is uniquely determined . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath5cs salt exhibits the nonlinear conduction for @xmath88 as shown in fig .",
    "4 , which naturally implies a larger scale of the co domain .",
    "imagine that the co domains form a percolative network in a fractal dimension .",
    "then a larger cluster can move for a smaller electric field , and the number of the mobile clusters gradually increase with increasing field .",
    "this picture is consistent with the charge inhomogeneity in the high - temperature superconductor @xcite .",
    "the most puzzling finding is the large hysteresis of @xmath14 and @xmath15 shown in fig .",
    "2 . at first glace",
    ", this resembles the switching behavior of k@xmath57moo@xmath58 @xcite , which was phenomenologically understood in terms of the damping rate depending on the cdw sliding velocity @xcite .",
    "however , the electric field was _ perpendicular _ to the charge modulation in the present case , and we can not expect the sliding of co across the layers .",
    "we can not expect either that a co domain hops from one layer to other , because it requires enormous numbers of electrons to tunnel simultaneously .",
    "we should further note that @xmath17 above @xmath46 decreases with increasing bias voltage for conventional cdw conductors @xcite , which is seriously incompatible with the data in fig .",
    "finally we will append a note that we have found a similar bias dependence in the dc conductivity of @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1csco(scn)@xmath2 , which has nearly the same structure as @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cszn(scn)@xmath2 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the giant nonlinear conduction is a generic feature for some @xmath89-type salts @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , @xmath83 for @xmath5cs is 30 m@xmath11 cm at 300 k @xcite , which is indeed anomalously high . in a two - dimensional conductor ,",
    "the mean free path @xmath90 is directly evaluated from the in - plane resistivity through the relation @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the interlayer spacing @xcite .",
    "then 30 m@xmath11 cm gives @xmath930.1 , and such a short @xmath90 is difficult to understand in the clean system .",
    "the metallic behavior ( @xmath94 ) at 300 k is also difficult to understand , because de broglie wavelength of the conducting electron is much shorter than @xmath90 for @xmath95 .",
    "we can clear up these difficulties , if the electronic states of the @xmath5cs salt are spacially inhomogeneous , because eq .",
    "( 8) is derived for a homogenous system .",
    "suppose most of the conduction electrons are nearly frozen to form co domains , and the unbound electrons flow in a percolation network consisting of the domain boundaries .",
    "then the effective cross section for the current path is much smaller than the bulk cross section of the sample , and the `` apparent '' resistivity would be much higher . if @xmath96 is still larger than unity in the current path , the conduction can be metallic to cause @xmath97 . judging from the anomalously high in - plane resistivity",
    ", we think that the self - organization of the electrons in @xmath5cs readily starts even at room temperature .",
    "then the self - organized co is gradually frozen with decreasing temperature , and eventually shows the cdw - like collective excitation .",
    "let us discuss the reason why the self - organized inhomogeneity is realized in the @xmath0type salts .",
    "mori @xcite calculated the ground - state energy for the @xmath0type salts using the extended hubbard model , and discussed possible co patterns at finite temperatures .",
    "he found that the on- and off - site coulomb repulsions are of the same order , and their delicate balance causes various co patterns .",
    "in particular , `` horizontal '' , `` diagonal '' and `` 3-fold '' patterns are nearly degenerate in the @xmath5cs salt , and thus it is highly probable that different charge orders coexist .",
    "furthermore , these charge orders would be strongly coupled with phonons , as was evidenced by the strong fano effects in the infrared spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "thus co domains of different patterns store finite elastic energies , which prevents the domains to grow in size @xcite . as a result ,",
    "homogeneous phase transition is seriously suppressed , and the domains are frozen at low temperatures like polar nano - regions in relaxor ferroelectrics @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that the @xmath5cs salt can be a canonical material showing the intrinsic inhomogeneity in the electron density .",
    "a remaining issue is up to what temperature the collective excitation can be observed .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath46 in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) as a function of temperature . clearly , the phase boundary would exist above 20 k. if we extrapolate the data to higher temperatures as indicated by the dotted line , we can estimate the temperature for @xmath98 to be 65 k , which is roughly the same temperature at which @xmath99 in the high - bias state is equal to @xmath82 in fig . 5 . to measure @xmath46 at higher temperatures , we should employ a pulse generator to avoid the joule heating , which will be tried in future work .",
    "the metallic state above @xmath79 is not yet understood . in cdw conductors ,",
    "the high - biased state is the state that cdw is sliding with a finite damping from the normal electrons , which has been established from the diffraction experiment in high electric fields . in the present case , the @xmath5cs salt only has the short range order of co , where the phase of co acquires no rigidity .",
    "then the sliding of co is difficult to expect .",
    "another choice is the melting of co by electric field , like the vortex lattice melting by magnetic field in a type - ii superconductor . to clarify this problem ,",
    "diffraction measurements in electric fields are indispensable , and microscopic theory to explain our findings is also necessary .",
    "we have observed the large dielectric response and giant nonlinear conduction in @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cszn(scn)@xmath2 .",
    "the data resemble those for charge - density - wave ( cdw ) conductors such as k@xmath57moo@xmath58 .",
    "however , @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cszn(scn)@xmath2 shows no second - order transition down to 4 k , which implies that it exhibits cdw - like collective excitations in the `` normal '' state .",

    "<S> the dielectric constant and ac conductivity have been measured for the layered organic conductor @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cszn(scn)@xmath2 along the out - of - plane direction , which show a relaxation behavior similar to those in the charge - density - wave conductor . </S>",
    "<S> most unexpectedly , they exhibit a large bias dependence with a hysteresis , and changes in magnitude by 100 - 1000 times at a threshold . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are very similar to the collective excitation of the charge density wave . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cszn(scn)@xmath2 has collective excitations associated with charge ordering , though it shows no clear indication of long range order . </S>"
