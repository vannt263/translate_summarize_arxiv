    "the tailed tent map maintains the uniform asymptotic density distribution of the states , while not disturbing characteristics of the tent map .",
    "for example , the utilization of the tailed tent map for true random number generation results in the generation of correlated output binary sequence . in  @xcite ,",

    "is assumed to be positive , the output is confined in positive values . for @xmath39",
    ", the system does not demonstrate chaotic behavior .",
    "regardless of the initial state of the system , the output will ultimately settle in zero .",
    "for @xmath40 , the system also shows chaotic behavior . in this mode , the output alternates between positive and negative values with each iteration . in this region , the system does not have an asymptotic density distribution . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the system is chaotic and the bifurcation diagram represents its asymptotic density distribution",
    ".    for @xmath42 , equation  ( [ eq : bifurcation ] ) represents a map that is given by @xmath43 as the equation shows , this is exactly like the tent map for @xmath44 . here ,",
    "if @xmath31 is a little bit greater than @xmath45 , the system could still maintain the state confined in the system since the output could jump to the negative side of the map , which is the fundamental difference between this map and the tent map . in the tent map ,",
    "if the slope is more than @xmath45 , the system could not maintain the state confined .",
    "therefore , the tent map could not be used for practical applications under process variations and noise .",

    "in this section , we propose the utilization of a current mode circuit implementation for the presented modified tent map . in current mode circuits ,",

    "current mode circuits have recently attracted great attention because of their capability of very low supply voltage operation  @xcite .",
    "while scaling the feature size , the supply voltage is scaled more rapidly than the threshold voltage , which in turn decreases the overdrive voltage of the transistors and limits the voltage swing . in current mode circuits ,",
    "high current gains can be achieved while the nodal voltages are floating  @xcite .",
    "current mode circuits will be playing an important role in the future deep sub - micron technologies , e.g. , telecommunications , analog signal processing , and multiprocessors  @xcite .",
    "the presented modified tent map is a _ continuous _ piecewise affine map , where we implemented it by the affine interpolation of the value at the breakpoints , proposed in  @xcite . in this method , the affine partitions",
    "are implemented using elementary blocks based on the detection of the breakpoints .",
    "therefore , it is straight - forward to detect whether the output value is within a certain affine partition of the map , and generate a binary output sequence .",
    "we performed hspice simulations in tsmc @xmath46 technology for the modified tent map circuit .",

    "we demonstrate the feasibility of binary generation from the presented modified tent map . in figure",

    "the state @xmath52 corresponds to the bit @xmath58 and the state @xmath57 corresponds to the bit @xmath59 .",
    "as discussed earlier , the binary sequence generated from a modified tent map is exactly the same as the binary sequence generated from a tent map due to the symmetry of the bit - generation process around the origin .",
