    "the physics of two - channel kondo effect ( 2cke ) that is marked by non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior at low temperatures has been with us for more than three decades.@xcite .",
    "complex quantum dots ( cqd ) coupled to metallic leads via several channels may be considered as candidates for possible realization of multichannel ke .",
    "the simplest object of this kind is a double quantum dot coupled to two source and two lead electrodes.@xcite the generic @xmath2 symmetry of this device is realized by two spin 1/2 projections and two orbital states of an electron in a double quantum dot .",
    "this configuration paves the way to observation of the @xmath2 kondo effect for four - fold degenerate ground state or at least for the orbital @xmath3 ke realized only by orbital degrees .",
    "it should be noted that unavoidable interference between different channels emerging in cotunneling process through cqd turns the @xmath2 fixed point to be unstable.@xcite as a result of this inteference one of the two channels becomes dominant at low temperatures , resulting in an @xmath4 crossover ( see ref . and references therein for experimental realization of these effects in carbon nanotubes and multivalley silicon quantum dots ) .",
    "in order to realize 2cke for odd occupation in double quantum dot structures , one more tunneling channel should be involved in electron tunneling processes .",
    "however the nfl regime is still elusive due to the same channel anisotropy emerging from inter - channel cotunneling processes . to remedy this instability ,",
    "a suppression of interchannel cotunneling is attempted , using special design of the cqd .",
    "apparently , the most successful attempt is realized in double quantum dot ( dqd),@xcite where the interference is suppressed by coulomb blockade .",
    "another design which allows one to ( at least ) approach the elusive two - channel fixed point was suggested in ref .  ,",
    "based on a structure composed of triple quantum dot ( tqd ) in a serial geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , left panel ) . here , the strong coulomb blockade in the central dot minimizes ( but does not completely eliminate ) interchannel interference .",
    "yet another approach for achieving nfl two - channel kondo regime is to swap the roles of charge and spin variables , i.e. , to treat orbital or charge fluctuations as pseudospin variables causing kondo screening , whereas spin projection quantum numbers serve as different channels.@xcite the proposal was based on the idea that the orbital degrees of freedom of heavy spinless particles in a two - well or three - well potential trap may be converted into pseudospin variables , and the latter may play part of the source of kondo screening , while the spin projections of conduction electrons enumerate the screening channels .",
    "this idea was subject to criticism.@xcite in these systems , pseudospin - flip is a generic tunneling process with a characteristic ( long ) time @xmath5 , unlike real spin flip processes which are practically instantaneous . as a result",
    "the ultraviolet cutoff for kondo effect is the energy @xmath6 .",
    "this energy is of the order of the distance to the next excited level in two - well potential .",
    "the latter interval is much smaller than the energy scale @xmath7 for `` light '' electrons . as a result",
    "the energy interval available for the formation of the logarithmic singularity is too narrow and the resulting kondo temperature is very small @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the depth of the occupied level in the well relative @xmath10 thus the strong coupling regime remains in fact unattainable as far as two - level systems in heavy particles serve as pseudospin .",
    "some theoretical counter - arguments have been offered later,@xcite whereas features of nfl behavior were found in the electrical resistivity of glassy thasse single crystal.@xcite thus , the question of whether 2cke can be unambiguously realized in two - level systems is still under discussion ( see also ref . ) .",
    "natural and artificial nano - objects provide their own mechanisms of two - channel kondo tunneling assisted by pseudospin excitations .",
    "one such mechanism was proposed for a `` quantum box '' connected to a lead by a single - mode point contact .",
    "@xcite in this case the relevant operator which logarithmically scales the crossover from the high temperature to the low - temperature region is the capacitance @xmath11 . in another model with @xmath12 dynamical symmetry",
    "the excited state with parity - degenerate rotational levels @xmath13 may cross the @xmath14 level due to interaction with a bath and thus become the source of orbital ke with spin playing the part of a tunneling channel . @xcite",
    "one more possibility of realizing 2cke was discussed recently@xcite for a quantum dot coupled to two helical edge states of a 2d topological insulator .",
    "in this work we offer a relatively simple realization of over - screened orbital kondo effect where the two - channel regime is realized by two spin projections .",
    "the proposed device is composed of a doubly occupied tqd in contact with two terminals within parallel geometry @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the present model is free of the shortcomings pointed out in refs . because the role of higher excited levels is completely different .",
    "experimentally , this configuration may be realized in triangular arrangement of vertical dots @xcite ( see fig  [ fig_1 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the starting point is the usual anderson - like tunneling hamiltonian , @xmath15 where @xmath16 we consider the configuration possessing both left - right ( @xmath17-@xmath18 ) and source - drain ( @xmath19-@xmath20 ) symmetry .",

    "<S> a scenario for the formation of non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) kondo effect ( ke ) with spin variable enumerating kondo channels is suggested and worked out . in doubly occupied symmetric triple quantum dot within parallel geometry </S>",
    "<S> , the nfl low - energy regime arises provided the device possesses both source - drain and left - right parity . </S>",
    "<S> kondo screening follows a multistage renormalization group mechanism : reduction of the energy scale is accompanied by the change of the relevant symmetry group from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . at low energy , </S>",
    "<S> three phases compete : 1 ) under - screening spin triplet ( conventional ) ke ; 2 ) spin singlet potential scattering ; 3 ) nfl phase where the roles of spin and orbital degrees of freedom are swapped . </S>"
