    "theories and experiments on anderson localization@xcite have been a vibrant topic of solid state physics for more than five decades . for a long time",
    ", it seems , it was the only problem in which disorder and phase coherence were brought together to generate macroscopic effects in electron transport through solids .",
    "in particular the scaling theory initially advanced by thouless@xcite and further developed toward the end of the seventies and early eighties brought the conductance of disordered systems into focus@xcite .",
    "the key argument of the single parameter scaling theory of localization is that the conductance ( not conductivity or anything else ) is in fact the only parameter that counts .",
    "long after the early work of landauer@xcite , this emphasis on conductance eventually brought to the forefront the question@xcite of a `` correct formulation of conductance '' .",
    "it is on this background that the notion of quantum channels and the scattering matrix as a central object of electrical transport theory emerged .",
    "a multi - terminal formulation@xcite of conductance brought much clarity and permitted to connect the scattering theory of electrical conductance to the onsager theory of irreversible processes .",
    "this triggered questions about dynamic fluctuations and led to a very successful theory of current noise in mesoscopic structures@xcite .",
    "the quest to understand the quantum coherent conductance through a disordered region led to more than simply a relation between conductance and transmission .",
    "while in the discussions of the localization the calculation of conductance always implied an average over an ensemble of disorder configurations , eventually , the basic question was raised whether we can observed interference effects directly rather than indirectly by considering an ensemble averaged quantity .",
    "this brought the specific sample into focus .",
    "early work proposed samples with the shape of a ring with the hole of the ring penetrated by an aharonov - bohm flux ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1.1a ] , [ fig1.1b ] ) . of interest was the sample specific response to the aharonov - bohm flux .",
    "the oscillation of the quantity of interest with the period of the single particle flux quantum @xmath0 would be the direct signature of single particle interference .",
    "these expectations led to the prediction @xcite of persistent currents and josephson ( bloch ) oscillations in closed disordered rings and aharonov - bohm oscillations with a period of a single charge flux quantum in rings connected to leads@xcite .",
    "we mention here only two recent experiments : one on persistent currents @xcite and one on aharonov - bohm conductance oscillations @xcite . for additional references and a broader account of this development",
    ", we refer to imry s book @xcite .",
    "the effect of an aharonov - bohm flux on the properties of a disordered systems was not entirely novel in mesoscopic physics : it occurs already in discussions of the anderson transition .",
    "the sensitivity to boundary conditions played a very important part in localization theories .",
    "different transverse boundary conditions for wires are already investigated by dorokhov@xcite in the form of an ab - flux along the axes of a cylindrical wire .",
    "nevertheless these discussions were a purely technical means to arrive at an ensemble average conductance .",
    "however there is an aharonov - bohm effect which shows up even in the ensemble averaged conductance . in the absence of a magnetic field , interference effects of self - intersecting trajectories",
    "are not averaged out since there exists a time reversed trajectory which traverses the loop in the opposite direction with exactly the same phase .",
    "this leads to enhanced backscattering and , if a magnetic flux is applied to the sample , to oscillations with decaying amplitude and a period in magnetic field determined by the size of the most likely self - intersecting loop .",
    "the enhanced backscattering is known as weak localization .",
    "the magnetic field oscillations were first discussed by altshuler , aronov and spivak@xcite , and were soon demonstrated in an ingenious experiment by sharvin and sharvin@xcite who created a cylinder by coating a glass fiber with a metallic film .",
    "this lead to the first observations of an aharonov - bohm effect in a dissipative , metallic diffusive conductor .",
    "the concern with the conductance of an elastic scatterer led to a novel approach in which transport quantities are expressed in terms of the scattering matrix . from initial efforts to discuss",
    "the conductance in the presence of stationary applied voltages there exist now formulations of transport problems for a wide range of situations .",
    "we will discuss only a few topics , the response to oscillating voltages , which implies a concern with capacitance , quantum pumping , and non - linear dynamic transport leading to a description of single particle emission from localized states .",
    "there are many additional extensions which we will not further discuss here , extensions to superconducting - normal structures , conductors with spin orbit interactions , systems like graphene or topological insulators and superconductors .",
    "the message is simply to point to the wider application of scattering theory .",
    "many of these novel developments concern the variation of the scattering matrix due to a variation of one or several parameters .",
    "the scattering matrix can be varied through a displacement of an impurity , a change in a gate voltage or due to a magnetic field .",
    "changes of the scattering matrix lead to transfer of charge out of the scatterer into the contacts or from contacts into the sample .",
    "let @xmath1 be the scattering matrix of a conductor .",
    "its elements are @xmath2 where @xmath3 numbers the leads connected to the scattering region .",
    "let there be a small variation in a parameter of the s - matrix that leads to a change in the scattering matrix which we can denote by @xmath4 .",
    "a variation of the scattering matrix typically implies a transfer of charge from the sample into the leads .",
    "an elegant expression for the charge transferred from the scattering region into a contact@xcite @xmath5 is           + in the absence of a magnetic field injected and emitted charge are the same . in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath9 the emittance is equal to the injectance in the reversed magnetic field , @xmath10 .",
    "these expressions are close relatives of the wigner - smith matrix@xcite , a time - shift matrix@xcite , scattering matrix expressions of the ac - response of a conductor to a slow potential variation@xcite and they are now widely used to describe quantum pumping@xcite .",

    "below we discuss how this leads to expressions for the capacitance of mesoscopic conductors@xcite .",
    "+ the total charge emitted by the sample is @xmath17 .",
    "this is nothing but the friedel sum rule@xcite which relates the variation of the phase @xmath18 to the charge of the scatterer ( krein formula in mathematics ) .",
    "the phase @xmath5 describes the asymmetry in reflection at the scatterer of carriers incident from the left as compared to those incident from the right .",
    "a displacement @xmath19 of the scatterer to the right changes @xmath5 by @xmath20 .",
    "it absorbs charge from the left lead and emits it into the right lead . note",
    "that the transmission can be completely suppressed@xcite and the scatterer than acts as a `` snow plow '' .",
    "the phase @xmath14 can be non - vanishing only if time - reversal symmetry is broken , that is , if a magnetic field acts on the conductor .",
    "therefore we can suppose that @xmath14 is the result of a vector potential , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the single charge flux quantum .",
    "suppose that @xmath23 is generated by an aharonov - bohm flux @xmath24 which depends linearly on time .",
    "the electric field generated by the flux induces a voltage @xmath25 between the reservoirs connected to the sample .",
    "the phase @xmath14 increases as @xmath26 with @xmath25 the voltage induced across the sample .",
    "we then have@xcite @xmath27 which with the transmission probability @xmath28 is the landauer conductance @xmath29 .",
    "the phase @xmath18 multiples all channels .",
    "it is a phase that depends on what we consider the scatterer and the outside regions . in one dimension , on the line",
    ", phases of the scattering matrix are defined from two points to the right and left of the scatterer .",
    "( more generally scattering phases depend on the choice of cross - sections ) . if we extend the region that we attribute to the scatterer by @xmath19 on both sides of the scatterer the phase @xmath18 changes by @xmath30 .",
    "this operation removes charges from the leads and we have @xmath31 .",
    "there are two close relatives of the expressions for charge transfer given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) . with both the emittance eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and the injectance eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) we can associate a wigner - smith delay time matrix @xcite . in the first case we focus on the time - delay in the outgoing channel regardless of the input channel and in the second case",
    "we specify the incoming channel but sum over all outgoing channels . multiplying the emittance per unit energy with @xmath33",
    "gives the time delay matrix       + the wigner phase delay times are the diagonal elements of this matrix .",
    "the off - diagonal elements also have physical significance and going back to charge we can related them to charge density fluctuations@xcite .",
    "there is a dual to the wigner - smith matrix which avron et al.@xcite call the energy shift matrix .",
    "it is important once the scattering matrix is taken to be time - dependent .",
    "the energy shift matrix is       + the two matrices do not commute , reflecting the time - energy uncertainty .",
    "since they are matrices , we can define two commutators ( poisson brackets ) depending on the order in which they are taken .",
    "these commutators play an important role whenever there is a time - variation of the scattering matrix .",
    "one of them ,       + defines the spectral densities of currents generated by a parametric variation of the scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "the other order , @xmath37 , defines corrections to the scattering matrix proportional to the frequency @xmath38 with which parameters of the scattering matrix are varied.@xcite      the energy shift matrix multiplied by @xmath39 defines a matrix of currents .",

    "gives the current in contact @xmath5 in response to a potential oscillating over the entire region of the scatterer .",
    "the potential @xmath46 typically is a function not only of time but also of space @xmath47 .",
    "this can be taken into account by testing the scattering matrix with respect to a small localized potential at every point @xmath47 in the sample and integrating the result over the entire scattering region ,       + this is the result obtained by one of the authors in collaboration with h.  thomas and a.  prtre @xcite .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) is a zero temperature result .",
    "it depends on the scattering matrix only at the fermi energy .      for a sinusoidal potential the time average",
    "current vanishes .",
    "however , if @xmath49 can not be written as a product of a time - dependent function times a spatial function , but effectively varies the potential of the conductor at several points and out of phase , the current integrated over a period @xmath50 does not average to zero , and eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) describes a pump current@xcite       + where @xmath52 is the `` pump path '' .",
    "it is often stated that pumping needs at least two parameters which oscillate out of phase .",

    "however , single parameter pumps are also possible : a typical example is an archimedes screw where we turn only one handle to generate a pumped current@xcite .",

    "can not be described merely via a temporal variation of a scattering matrix dependent on a single energy .",
    "in contrast the scattering matrix dependent on two energies@xcite or , equivalently , two times@xcite has to be used .",
    "thouless investigated pumping in band insulators@xcite .",

    "this formulation assumes that the fermi energy lies in a spectral gap . on the other hand in gap - less anderson insulators",
    "quantized pumping is also possible .",
    "it is due to tunneling resonances through the sample@xcite .",
    "thouless s result seems hard to reconcile with a pump formula that is based explicitly only on the properties of the scattering matrix at the fermi energy .",
    "however , graf and ortelli@xcite have shown that by taking a periodic lattice of some finite length l and coupling it on either side to metallic contacts , the scattering approach converges , in the limit of a very long lattice , to the quantized pump current of thouless .",
    "the point is of course , that as soon as the lattice is taken to be finite , there are exponentially decaying states which penetrate from the contacts into the sample .",
    "considering the scattering matrix due to these states gives in the long length limit the same result as found from thouless s approach .",
    "while the one - channel case permits to solve this problem by direct calculation , the many channel case requires more thought@xcite .",
    "consider a conductor connected to multiple contacts@xcite and suppose that the voltages @xmath67 at the contacts oscillate with frequency @xmath38 .",

    "in linear response the total current has in general two contributions : a current that is solely the response to the external voltage applied to the contact defines a conductance @xmath72 and a current that arises because the application of external voltages charges the sample which leads through interaction to an internal potential @xmath43 ,           + the internal potential is found self - consistently by the requirement that potentials are defined only up to a constant ( an overall shift in potentials does not change a physical quantity ) .",
    "this implies           + here we now consider leads with several transverse channels . the trace @xmath79 is a sum over transverse channels in the leads @xmath7 and @xmath80 . using the above and requiring that current is conserved determines the internal potential . eliminating the internal potential leads to a total conductance@xcite        a voltage at contact @xmath82 of the conductor does , in the absence of interactions ,",

    "if two electrons ( holes ) are emitted simultaneously , then due to the pauli exclusion principle they should be in different states , and that for spinless particles means different energies .",
    "the second emitted particle should have an energy larger than the first one . to be more precise , the electron ( hole ) pair",
    "has a larger energy then the sum of energies of two separately emitted electrons ( holes ) .",
    "therefore , the heat flow @xmath150 generated by the double - cavity capacitor should be enhanced , that , by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eq37 ] ) , implies an enhanced mean square current .",
    "the success of scattering theory of electrical transport for conductance and noise is well known .",
    "we have shown that interesting conductance problems , of a qualitatively different nature , like the movement of charge in and out of a conductor , the ac - response to small amplitude voltage oscillations and even the large amplitude non - linear response find an elegant formulation in scattering theory .",
    "novel experiments in a 2d electron gas in the integer quantum hall effect regime demonstrate@xcite quantization of the charge relaxation resistance of a mesoscopic cavity at half a von klitzing resistance quantum . a successor experiment demonstrates@xcite that a localized state can serve as a sub - nanosecond , single - electron source for coherent quantum electronics . both of these phenomena seem to be well descried by scattering theory .",
    "we only mention a few additional elements of a coherent quantum electronics using such sources in this paper .",
    "the shot noise produced by the particles emitted by a dynamical localized state due to scattering at a quantum point contact is quantized , i.e. , it is proportional to the number of emitted particles during an oscillation period @xmath50.@xcite if two emitters are placed at different sides of a qpc then they contribute to shot noise additively , unless they are synchronized such that both cavities emit electrons ( holes ) at the same time .",
    "in this case the shot noise vanishes.@xcite this effect arises due to fermi - correlations between electrons ( holes ) colliding at the qpc and propagating to different contacts .",
    "this effect looks similar to the hong , ou , and mandel@xcite effect in optics .",
    "however for fermions ( electrons ) the two - particle probability peaks while for bosons ( photons ) it shows a dip . in collaboration with j.  splettstoesser , we demonstrated that synchronized sources of uncorrelated particles can produce orbitally entangled pairs of electrons ( holes).@xcite the amount of entanglement can be varied from zero to a maximum by a simple variation of the difference of phase @xmath207 of the potentials driving the localized states .",
