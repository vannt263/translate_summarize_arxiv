    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has been proven to be an invaluable tool in the study of superconductors by serving as a probe of the density of states with very high energy resolution and sub - nanometer spatial resolution@xcite .",
    "stm has also been successfully used to create tunnel junctions on materials that do not readily form high quality planar junctions ( _ e.g .  _ in mgb@xmath2)@xcite , or in cases where a particular small region of the sample is of interest@xcite .    in recent years",
    "it has been realized@xcite that the use of superconducting ( sc ) stm tips may provide a complementary technique to conventional stm studies , since in sc stm both quasiparticle and josephson tunneling can be measured locally with a scannable superconductor / insulator / superconductor ( s / i / s ) junction .",
    "here we report on experiments we performed using sc stm tips .",
    "we measure the tunneling characteristics of pb and nbse@xmath2 samples at t@xmath32 k for various values of the junctions normal state resistances . for junction resistances below 100 k@xmath4",
    "we observe fluctuation dominated josephson effects , and estimate the josephson i@xmath0r@xmath1 product , a physically important quantity , for tunneling into nbse@xmath2 .",
    "superconducting tips are prepared according to ref .   by deposition of pb(5000 )/ag(30",
    " ) proximity bilayers on conventional ptir tips . fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows a typical di / dv curve for tunneling at 2.1 k between a sc tip and a pb(5000 )/ag(30  ) sample deposited on a graphite substrate at the same time as the tips were made .",
    "sharp peaks are seen at voltages @xmath5 , and the pb phonon structure is clearly observed , confirming the high quality of the junction and that single - step tunneling is the dominant conduction mechanism . at these thicknesses ( 30  )",
    "the ag contributes very little to the junction characteristics .",
    "the method described above for sc tip fabrication is robust and reproducible , yielding over 80% working tips , with virtually indistinguishable sc properties .",
    "= = 3.0 in    the measurement of the josephson effect in stm junctions is challenging due to their small size and the associated high junction resistance .",
    "the energy scale for the phase coupling of a josephson junction is the josephson binding energy , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 k@xmath4 , @xmath8 is the sc gap , and @xmath9 is the normal state resistance of the junction . in junctions",
    "for which @xmath10 , phase locking is destroyed by thermal fluctuations , and no dc supercurrent can be observed .",
    "indeed , for pb junctions with resistances @xmath3100 m@xmath4 , the josephson binding energy is @xmath11 mk , and we see no trace of the dc josephson effect at our base temperature of 2.1 k ( fig .  [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "several authors have shown@xcite that when @xmath12 is smaller than , but comparable to @xmath13 , the phase dynamics in a small josephson junction is dominated by thermal fluctuations . in this regime pair tunneling would be observed , but the pair current will be dissipative , with the voltage drop proportional to the rate of change of the relative phase across the junction .",
    "ivanchenko and zilberman@xcite found that the current - voltage ( @xmath14 ) relation for small @xmath15 due to this incoherent pair tunneling has the form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the effective impedance of the junction s environment , and @xmath19 with @xmath20 defined as the effective noise temperature .    fig .  [",
    "fig1](b ) shows representative @xmath14 curves taken on a pb / ag film at 2.1 k for various junction resistances@xcite below 120 k@xmath4 .",
    "a current peak in the @xmath14 characteristics emerges from the quasiparticle background as the junction resistance is lowered .",
    "the @xmath14 curves can be fitted with good agreement to eq .",
    "[ iv ] for @xmath211.0 mv , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 as the only fitting parameters .",
    "the dependence of the quantity @xmath24 on @xmath25 should be linear with a slope equal to @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows such a plot for several pb / ag samples and a nbse@xmath2 sample . knowing the noise temperature @xmath20",
    ", one can infer the josephson product @xmath27 .",
    "fluctuation dominated dc and ac josephson effects were observed and carefully analyzed in ref .  , confirming that the features we observe in the tunneling characteristics of these stm junctions are indeed signatures of pair tunneling .",
    "we have shown@xcite that the noise parameters @xmath20 and @xmath18 depend only on the experimental setup and not on the sample studied or the tip used .",
    "once these parameters are determined by measuring a sample with a known @xmath27 ( _ e.g .  _",
    "pb ) , this quantity can be inferred for any sample measured under the same experimental conditions@xcite .",
    "we apply the method described above to the measurement of the josephson product for tunneling between a sc stm tip and a 2h  nbse@xmath2 crystal . 2h  nbse@xmath2 is a layered material that undergoes a charge density wave ( cdw ) transition at 33 k and a superconducting transition at 7.2 k. niobium diselenide has been studied extensively in the past@xcite , but to our knowledge , no reliable josephson tunneling data exist for this system . while nbse@xmath2 appears to be a conventional bcs superconductor , it shows anisotropy of the sc order parameter@xcite , transport and optical properties@xcite , as well as coexisting cdw and sc states .",
    "these make nbse@xmath2 an interesting system , especially since the high - t@xmath0 cuprates are believed to share some of these properties@xcite .",
    "@xmath14 curves were measured at 2.1 k on a 2h  nbse@xmath2 single crystal@xcite cleaved at room temperature in vacuum ( @xmath28 torr ) . for junction resistances larger than 40 k@xmath4 , the scaled tunneling current @xmath29",
    "is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "we use these curves to represent the background quasiparticle current , with no josephson contribution , which we then subtract from the @xmath14 curves measured at lower @xmath9 to find the contribution of pair tunneling to the total current .",
    "this is done because junctions with nbse@xmath2 as one of the electrodes have considerable quasiparticle weight below the gap even at this temperature of 2.1 k.    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a plot constructed from the fits to eq .",
    "[ iv ] for several pb / ag films and the nbse@xmath2 data shown in the inset . from linear fits to the data we obtain the slopes @xmath30 mv@xmath31 and @xmath32 mv@xmath31 for pb / ag and nbse@xmath2 respectively .",
    "the ratio of @xmath27(pb / i / nbse@xmath2 ) and @xmath27(pb / i / pb ) is thus @xmath33 . since @xmath27(pb / i / pb)=1.671 mv is known@xcite from the ambegaokar - baratoff ( ab ) formula@xcite",
    ", we get @xmath27(pb / i / nbse@xmath2)=@xmath34 mv .",
    "the sc gap in nbse@xmath2 can be described quite well by an anisotropic s - wave gap function@xcite , with @xmath35 ranging from 0.7 to 1.4 mev over the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "estimates using the ab formula for pb / i / nbse@xmath2 junctions yield @xmath361.25 mv , significantly higher than the one we observe , even when using the smallest gap parameter in nbse@xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the gap anisotropy alone can not explain our result and we must look for additional possible explanations .",
    "a further reduction in @xmath27 may result from the existence of a cdw and its effect on the sc state .",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite calculated the josephson product for cdw and sdw superconductors and found that it decreases from the ab limit by an amount that depends on the ratio between the cdw and the sc energy gaps , and the degree to which the fs is affected by the formation of a cdw gap . in light of our results",
    "it appears that explanations along these lines should be sought , especially since the effects of a cdw may be important in the interpretation of josephson data in high - t@xmath0 cuprates .    in summary , we measured the josephson effect in junctions formed between sc stm tips and pb and nbse@xmath2 samples .",
    "in nbse@xmath2 we find the josephson product @xmath37 mv . this result is smaller than expected from the ab formula , but may be described within the theory of gabovich _ et al .  _ for josephson tunneling in cdw superconductors .",
    "these results suggest that the interplay between the sc state and the cdw may have an important role in josephson tunneling .",
    "the noise temperature in this experiment is estimated to be @xmath38 k. this is much higher than the bath temperature , and can be traced to noise sources at room temperature , and leakage of radiation into our cryostat ."
