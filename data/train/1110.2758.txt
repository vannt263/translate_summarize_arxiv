    "there are many examples of such functors .",
    "the best known is perhaps the one that sends a @xmath2-algebra @xmath12 to its primitive ideal space , denoted @xmath13 . restricting to the category of commutative @xmath2-algebras",
    "we obtain a classifying functor , since in this case we may apply gelfand duality , and if one restricts further to unital commutative @xmath2-algebras then this is even a strong classifying functor .",
    "it is also well known that the range of the functor is all locally compact hausdorff spaces , but apart from the obvious fact that when @xmath14 is not hausdorff , then @xmath12 is not commutative , there is no obvious way to recognize the commutative @xmath2-algebras by looking at primitive ideal spaces .    among other",
    "well known classifying functors , we have the ordered @xmath15 ( with unit or scale ) which classifies af - algebras , and the graded @xmath16 , which classifies purely infinite simple @xmath2-algebras which are nuclear and fall in the uct class .",
    "these are strong classification results , the ranges of the invariants are known , and in the former case quite a lot is known about how to recognize the classified @xmath2-algebra in larger classes by looking at their @xmath17-theory .",
    "in @xcite it was boldly conjectured that the ideal related @xmath17-theory @xmath18 , is a classifying ( up to stable isomorphism ) functor for graph @xmath2-algebras with finitely many ideals .",
    "supporting evidence for this conjecture can , for instance , be found in @xcite , where graph @xmath2-algebras with small or otherwise special ideal lattices are classified using @xmath18 .",
    "although we are apparantly still a long way away from resolving whether @xmath18 is a classifying ( up to stable isomorphism ) functor for graph @xmath2-algebras , the conjecture raises the following additional questions :    1 .",
    "is @xmath18 a classifying functor ? 1 .",
    "is it a strong classifying functor ? 2 .",
    "can we achieve exact classification ?",
    "what is the range of @xmath19 ?",
    "which relation on graphs is induced by stable isomorphism ?",
    "are the graph algebras recognizable within larger classes of c*-algebras by @xmath18 ?",
    "is it possible to achieve permanence results for extensions of graph algebras ?",
    "these questions and their answers affect one another .",
    "we have tried to capture these connections in the following diagram .        in the class of graph @xmath2-algebras ,",
    "results pertaining to @xmath20 have been given in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and more will appear in @xcite .",

    "results of relevance for @xmath25 and @xmath26 have been obtained in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we resolve all the questions @xmath20 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for a special class of graph algebras  imposing this time , indirectly , a requirement on the involved @xmath17-groups instead of on the ideal lattice . instead of working directly with @xmath18 , we introduce , for any @xmath2-algebra , the * tempered primitive ideal space*. it turns out to be a complete invariant for the algebras we wish to study .",
    "this invariant , which we denote by @xmath27 , consists of the standard primitive ideal space @xmath28 along with a map @xmath29 which describes the nature of the @xmath15-groups of certain sub - quotients of @xmath12 .",
    "a formal definition is given in section [ sec : tempideal ] .    in terms of graphs ,",
    "what we want to consider are graphs with finitely many vertices and the special property that if there is an edge between two vertices , then there are infinitely many edges between them .",
    "we call such graphs amplified .",
    "naturally any vertex in such a graph is either an infinite emitter or a sink , and so the @xmath15-group is easily computed .",
    "it is simply the free abelian group with as many generators as our graph has vertices .",
    "furthermore such graphs always satisfies the technical condition @xmath30 so the ideal structure of a graph algebra is readily understood from the path structure of the graph .",
    "an important concept for us is the _ transitive closure _ of a graph @xmath31 , defined in the case of @xmath31 by adding an edge @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 to the graph if no such edge exists , but there is a path from @xmath35 to @xmath36 in @xmath31 .",
    "we denote this graph by @xmath37 .",

    "we provide various extensions of this result ; we extend to cover classification of ( some ) graphs where all vertices are singularities and prove an effros - handelman - shen type theorem for the range of the invariant .",
    "this is then used to show permanence properties for certain graph @xmath0-algebras , hence answering questions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
