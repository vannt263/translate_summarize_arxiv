    "the cdf collaboration @xcite at the fermilab tevatron has recently reported the discovery of @xmath2 mesons .",
    "their announced value for the mass of the ground state is @xmath3 , and their value for the ground state lifetime is @xmath4 .",
    "this state should be one of a number of relatively stable states below the threshold for the emission of b and d mesons , and thus i want to present some results from a comprehensive calculation @xcite of the energies , splittings and electromagnetic decay rates of the low - lying states of the @xmath2 system .    in 1991",
    "kwong and rosner @xcite predicted the masses of the two lowest states of this system from an empirical mass formula and a logartihmic potential .",
    "they obtained a range for the ground state , @xmath5 .",
    "eichten and quigg @xcite gave a more comprehensive account of the properties of the @xmath2 system .",
    "using several potential models to obtain error estimates , they quoted @xmath6 for the ground state energy . in anticipation of the experimental interest in the @xmath2 system ,",
    "there have been a number of other potential model calculations @xcite .",
    "richardson s potential @xcite contains a confining potential and a short range piece , @xmath7 dx,\\ ] ] where the string constant will be treated as a free parameter instead of a function of @xmath8 in order to achieve a separation of the long and short distance parameters @xcite .    to specify the spin - dependent potentials , we will use pantaleone , tye and ng s ( ptn ) generalization @xcite of the eichten - feinberg formalism .",
    "thus @xmath9         + \\frac{{\\bf l } \\cdot { \\bf s}_{2 } } { 2 m_{2}^{2 } }      \\left [ \\frac{1}{r } \\frac{d}{d\\,r } ( e(r ) - ar + 2 v_{1 } )      - 2 v_{5 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\frac{{\\bf l } \\cdot ( { \\bf s}_{1 } + { \\bf s}_{2 } ) } { m_{1 } m_{2 } }       \\frac{1}{r } \\frac{d\\ , v_{2}}{d\\ , r } + \\frac{{\\bf l } \\cdot ( { \\bf s}_{1 } - { \\bf s}_{2 } ) } { m_{1 } m_{2 } } v_{5 } + \\frac{\\bf ( s_{\\rm 1 } \\cdot \\hat{r } \\,s_{\\rm 2 } \\cdot \\hat{r }      - \\frac{\\rm 1}{\\rm 3 } s_{\\rm 1}\\cdot s_{\\rm 2})}{m_{1 } m_{2 } } v_{3 }   + \\frac { { \\bf s}_{1 } \\cdot { \\bf s}_{2 } } { 3 m_{1 } m_{2 } } v_{4 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the component potentials e , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , include both the tree - level and the full radiative one - loop contributions . these may be expressed in terms of the strong coupling constant @xmath15 , the renormalization scale @xmath16 and the constituent masses . as an example , we list the second spin - orbit potential ,    @xmath17 \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is euler s constant .",
    "all of the ptn component potentials are given in the modified minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "the central potential parameters are assumed to be flavor independent .",
    "these parameters and the constituent masses are determined from the low - lying states of charmonium and the upsilon system .",
    "their values are @xmath19 and @xmath20 is taken to be 3 . for the upsilon system the value of the coupling constant @xmath21 and the value of the renormalization scale @xmath22 . for charmonium",
    "these values are @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in both cases",
    "the universal qcd scale @xmath25 , a value consistent with other determinations @xcite .",
    "these parameters give an average deviation of 4.3 mev for the upsilon states below the continuum threshold and an average deviation of 19.9 mev for the corresponding charmonium states .",
    "the one - loop potentials give a substantial advantage in simultaneously accounting for the fine structure and the hyperfine structure of charmonium and the upsilon system .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect they should produce better results for the spin - dependent effects in the @xmath2 system .",
    "since the central potential parameters are assumed to be strictly flavor independent and the constituent masses are not allowed to run , the only decision that one has to make to treat the @xmath2 system is to choose a value for @xmath26 .",
    "we choose @xmath27 , the average of the values for charmonium and the upsilon system .",
    "then preserving the value of the universal qcd scale requires that @xmath28 .",
    "our calculated results for the three lowest levels of the @xmath2 system are shown in figure  1 , where they are compared with earlier potential model calculations @xcite and recent lattice calculations .",
    "@xcite the 190 mev error associated with uncertainty of the overall energy scale of the lattice calculation is not shown . in figure  1",
    "fuii98 denotes the one - loop results and the fui98 results are based on tree - level expressions for the spin - dependent potentials , and one can see substantial differences for both the s and the p states .",
    "the fui98 results are very close to the results of eichten and quigg , as expected .    an important difference between the spectrum of the @xmath2 system and those of charmonium and",
    "the upsilon system arises because the total spin @xmath29 no longer commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "thus one must compute a mass - mixing matrix for p states , and it convenient to use the j - j coupling scheme @xcite for this purpose .",
    "after computing the matrix representatives of each of the spin - dependent operators in the spin - dependent potential , one finds that the @xmath30 states and the @xmath31 state are the same as in the l - s basis , but that the @xmath32 states are mixtures .",
    "our result for the lowest @xmath32 state is @xmath33 which is very near the j - j coupling limit , a result consistent with the lattice calculations @xcite . in this",
    "regard we differ from eichten and quigg @xcite , whose tree - level results were much closer to the l - s limit",
    ". this difference is reflected in the character of the spectrum of photons following the dipole radiative decays of the 1p state .",
    "assuming an equal distribution of initial populations , our results for the photon spectrum of this state contains 6 distinct lines , as shown in figure  2 , instead of the 4 one would expect in the l - s limit .    to estimate the uncertainty of our approach",
    ", we have allowed @xmath34 to vary from its charmonium value ( 0.486 ) to its upsilon value ( 0.30 ) .",
    "holding @xmath35 allows an error estimate of the ground state , that is , @xmath36 in order to determine the lifetime of the ground state , we have considered @xmath37-quark decay , where the charmed quark is a spectator , and c - quark decay , where the the antibottom quark is a spectator , and the annihilation channels reached by the @xmath2 decay constant .",
    "thus @xmath38 where most of the error arises from the uncertainty @xcite in the kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath39 .",
