    "two - pion hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) interferometry is a powerful tool of detection of the space - time structure of particle - emitting sources produced in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite . in conventional two - pion hbt analysis",
    "one needs fitting the two - pion hbt correlation functions with parametrized formulas to obtain quantitatively the source space - time results .",
    "so the explanations of the hbt results are model depended .",
    "imaging technique introduced by brown and danielewicz @xcite is a model - independent way .",
    "it can be used to extract the source geometry pictures ( source function ) directly from the two - pion correlation functions . this technique has been developed and used in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been much progress in understanding of the process of nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic . however , there are still many unsolved problems",
    ". one of them is the so - called hbt puzzle , @xmath2 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the transverse hbt radii parallel and perpendicular to the pion pair momentum @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a granular source model of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) droplets was put forth to explain the hbt puzzle .",
    "the suggestion was based on the observation that in the hydrodynamic calculations for the granular source the average particle emission time scales with the initial radius of the droplet , whereas the spacial size of the source is the scale of the distribution of the droplets . for a granular source with many of the small droplets distributed in a relatively large region ,",
    "the hbt radius @xmath3 can be close to @xmath5 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors further investigated the elliptic flow and hbt radii as a function of pion transverse momentum for an improved granular source model of qgp droplets .",
    "they argued that although a granular structure was suggested earlier as the signature of a first - order phase transition @xcite , the occurrence of granular structure may not be limited to first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "the large fluctuations of initial matter distribution @xcite in high energy heavy ion collisions may facilitate the occurrence of instability of the system during its subsequent expansion and fragmentation to many granular droplets together with surface tension effect @xcite .",
    "recent researches on event - by - event two - pion bose - einstein correlations in smoothed particle hydrodynamics indicate that the particle - emitting sources produced at rhic energy are inhomogeneous and there is a granular structure of many  lumps \" ( droplets ) @xcite . for a simple granular source model",
    "we will show that the two - pion source function has a two - tiered structure .",
    "in small relative coordinate @xmath6 region , the source function exhibits an enhancement because of the higher density in the droplets .",
    "previous rhic experimental imaging researches are mainly focused on the long - range tail of the source functions at large @xmath6 @xcite , and the deviations of the source function from gaussian distribution in the large @xmath6 region are believed mainly the contribution of long - lived resonances @xcite . in this paper we will focus our attention on the source functions in small @xmath6 region .",

    "our results indicate that the imaging technique is suitable for probing the granular structure of the particle - emitting sources .",
    "there is not visible granularity for the sources in au+au collisions at ags energies .",
    "however , the data for the rhic collisions with the selections of @xmath7 and @xmath1 gev / c are better described by the model with granular emission than from that of one gaussian .",
    "for the convenience of discussion later in the paper , we start out with a brief review of the imaging technique of brown and danielewicz @xcite .    based on the koonin - pratt formulism @xcite , the two - pion hbt correlation function",
    "may be expressed in the center - of - mass frame of the particle pair as @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the relative momentum of the pion pair , @xmath10 is the relative separation of emission points of the two particles , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the relative wave function of the pair . neglecting the final - state interaction of the pion pair , one has @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ cf1 ] ) , @xmath14 is the so - called two - particle source function . it may be written with wigner function as @xcite , @xmath15 here the wigner functions are normalized particle emission rates , @xmath16    for a spherically symmetric source function , @xmath17 , performing the angle integrations on the right hand of eq . ( [ cf1 ] ) , one gets the angle - averaged version of eq .",
    "( [ cf1 ] ) as , @xmath18 here @xmath19 , @xmath20 equation ( [ cf2 ] ) now is suitable in any frame and the problem of imaging becomes inverting @xmath21 with measured correlation function @xmath22 . after expanding the source function @xmath23 in @xmath24 basis @xcite , @xmath25",
    "the inversion problem reduces to the problem of solving the matrix equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the value of the correlation function at the @xmath28th bin of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the bin size of @xmath29 .    in present paper , the minimization package minuit @xcite",

    "4(a ) are 5 and 2.5 fm , and they are 15 and 1.5 fm for the granular source of fig .",
