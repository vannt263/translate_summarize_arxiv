    "the interplay between a magnetic order and superconductivity is a current issue . particularly , spin",
    "glass ordering has been reported in many physical systems that includes high-@xmath6 superconductors@xcite , heavy fermions@xcite and conventional superconductors doped with magnetic impurities@xcite like @xmath7 .",
    "these conventional superconductors can be modeled by a s - d exchange interaction between the localized magnetic impurities and the conducting fermions which have conventional bcs interaction ( nass et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the main interest of nass et al .  was to find the density of states in the presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "however , relatively little consideration has been given to the phase transition problem between spin glass and a superconductive order@xcite .    nevertheless , from a wider perspective",
    "the role of quantum fluctuations in disordered strongly interacting systems still needs to be fully understood .",
    "theoretical studies in recent years have shown plenty of interesting results .",
    "for instance , the presence of a non - fermi liquid behavior near @xmath8 transition between a metallic paramagnetic and a metallic spin glass in a model introduced to study the competition between kondo effect and rkky interaction@xcite .",
    "in addition , the random quantum heisenberg with generalized su(m ) spins@xcite produces a spin liquid ground state in the large m limit with a local dynamic susceptibility that is identical to a marginal fermi liquid .",
    "recently , a model has been introduced to study the phase transition between the spin glass ordering and the bcs pairing among fermions of opposite spins@xcite .",
    "this model has been obtained from the model of nass et al.@xcite by tracing out the conducting fermionic degrees of freedom by perturbation expansion .",
    "the remaining effective problem could be solved in its infinite ranged ising version .",
    "a rich phase diagram has been found in the @xmath3@xmath4 plane ( @xmath4 is the strength of the pairing interaction ) for fixed @xmath9 ( variance of the spin random coupling @xmath10 ) with a normal paramagnetic phase ( np ) , a spin glass phase ( sg ) and a pairing phase ( pair ) where there is formation of pairs in the sites .",
    "the first two phases ( np and sg ) are separated by a second order line at the spin glass transition temperature @xmath5 . however , the line @xmath11 between the np and pair phases is more complex .",
    "it is a second order line which ends at a tricritical point ( @xmath12 ) , where a first order line starts . below the spin glass transition temperature @xmath5 ,",
    "the last two phases ( sg and pair ) are separated by the same first order line transition .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to investigate the infinite ranged heisenberg version of the model given by ref .   in presence of a magnetic field for the half filling case .",
    "this many fermion problem is formulated by defining the su(2 ) spin variables as a bilinear combination of grassmann fields and computing the partition function through the path integral formalism .",
    "the disorder in the coupling @xmath10 is treated by standard replica formalism . for this representation of the spin variable",
    ", the fock space ( @xmath0 ) has four quantum states per site but only two of them are magnetic . as a consequence ,",
    "the sensitivity of the site to magnetic coupling is dependent on the occupation number which is controlled by quantum statistics .",
    "when the strength of the bcs coupling is increased , forcing the double occupation , the number of sites non - sensitive to the magnetic coupling increases .",
    "therefore , this mechanism could suppress magnetic ordering such as the spin glass phase .",
    "actually , that is what happens in the ising model@xcite even at the half filling situation .    in the replica formalism for the quantum spin glass ,",
    "the replica diagonal order parameter has to be solved coupled with the non - diagonal one ( the spin glass order parameter ) and the remaining order parameters of the problem . in consequence , the diagonal component is no longer constrained to unity and has an important role in the problem .",
    "in fact , the location of @xmath5 can be obtained through this component .",
    "this is the essential point : the location of other transitions of the problem are also dependent of this diagonal component even when the non - diagonal component is zero .",
    "another important aspect of these problems is that the order parameter ( the spin - spin correlation function ) are time dependent .",
    "bray and more@xcite , in their pioneering work , investigated the role of the quantum fluctuations in the heisenberg spin glass model by using the static approximation .",
    "they formulated the problem in the feynman s path integral formalism where the spins variables have a dependence on fictitious time @xmath13 .",
    "the static approximation neglects the time dependence giving an upper bound for the thermodynamic potential and the location of the transition points . for temperatures above the @xmath5",
    ", this approximation is expected to be exact together with the replica symmetric solution .",
    "this same problem has been studied@xcite with a formalism where the spin variables were represented by bilinear combinations of grassmann fields .",
    "the static approximation was used for the spin glass order parameter , while for the susceptibility ( associated to the replica diagonal order parameter ) was applied an instantaneous approximation .",
    "this approach has found a non - zero spin glass transition temperature for @xmath0 .",
    "goldschmidt and pik - yin lai@xcite used the same treatment as bray and more@xcite to obtain a phase diagram for the infinite ranged quantum heinsenberg and xy spin glass in an external magnetic field . due to the magnetic field ,",
    "the order parameters were separated in two groups : transversal to the field and parallel to it .",
    "this approach allowed to locate the spin glass transition transversal to the field and investigate the role of the tunneling in the transition .",
    "for instance , the results showed that the spin glass ( @xmath0 ) transition temperature @xmath5 is depressed for the heisenberg model as the field strength is increased .",
    "nevertheless , the tunneling was not strong enough to produce a transition at @xmath8 .    in the present fermionic formulation ,",
    "we have combined the methods of refs . and by applying a field over the fermionic spin variables , taking the transversal spin glass order parameter as null and using the static approximation for the remaining order parameters . in these circumstances ,",
    "the magnetic field also has depressed the transversal spin glass transition temperature .",
    "this approach has allowed us to study the transition line between np phase and the pair phase ( we use here the same terminology of ref .  ) even in lower temperature .",
    "this transition line ends at the transversal spin glass transition temperature which moves down as the field strength enhances .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ gen_form ] , we present our model and develop it to obtain the gran canonical potential and the saddle point equations for the order parameters in the half filling case . in section [ phase_diag ] , we analyse the transition line between the np and pair phases for several values of the magnetic field .",
    "the results show that as the magnetic field increases , larger values of the pairing interaction strength are necessary to produce a transition .",
    "we also locate the transition line between the normal paramagnetic phase and the spin glass phase .",
    "discussions and concluding remarks are presented in the last section .",
