    "control of light at the nanoscale is a burgeoning field , and optical antennae are fast emerging as one of the most important tools for collecting , emitting and more generally controlling light with nanoscale ( sub wavelength ) elements @xcite .",
    "this functionality derives from strong coupling of optical fields to plasmon modes in the antennae , where the resonance of the plasmon modes can be controlled by the geometry of the nanoscale elements .",
    "we are interested in the detection of high - frequency @xmath0 mhz ultrasound used for intravascular photoacoustic ( ivpa ) imaging @xcite .",
    "ivpa imaging is complementary to traditional intravascular ultrasound ( ivus ) imaging @xcite . in ivus",
    "imaging , ultrasound is used to interrogate the body , and an image is reconstructed from acoustic waves that are backscattered from blood vessel tissues . in ivpa imaging , a laser pulse is used to interrogate the body instead of ultrasound , and an image is reconstructed from broadband acoustic waves generated by light absorption events in various tissue components @xcite . consequently , ivpa imaging is less affected by the light scattering in tissues , and therefore , can penetrate deeper as compared with purely optical imaging methods @xcite .",
    "moreover , the contrast of ivus and ivpa imaging can be increased by exploiting harmonics of ultrasound generated due to backscattering from nonlinear contrast agents @xcite .",
    "this fact additionally motivates our interest in the nonlinear acoustic interaction and optical detection of harmonics of ultrasound .",
    "contrast in pa imaging arises from the natural variation in the optical absorption of tissue components .",
    "the absorption cross - section of an optical antenna is many orders of magnitude higher than that of tissues .",
    "consequently , recent attention has turned to the use of optical antennae ( plasmonic nanoparticles ) as contrast agents for ivpa imaging @xcite and all - optical sources of high - frequency ultrasound @xcite .",
    "hereafter we theoretically demonstrate that in addition to their ability to generate high - frequency ultrasound , single optical antennae immersed into a bulk liquid can also be used to detect ultrasound .",
    "ultrasonic transduction is via the detection of weak optical signals arising due to the brillouin light scattering ( bls ) from acoustic waves propagating in the liquid .",
    "this transduction mechanism is different from that proposed in ref .  , where a large array of plasmonic metamaterials was used for non - resonant optical detection of ultrasound .",
    "our idea is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . the spectrum of light scattered from acoustic waves has a form of a triplet , consisting of the central rayleigh peak and two brillouin peaks shifted from the frequency of the incident light by the frequency of acoustic wave [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] @xcite . in conventional approaches to detecting bls , the brillouin shift and the intensity of the brillouin peaks are much smaller than the frequency and intensity of the incident light , respectively , and sophisticated instrumentation @xcite has to be used to determine them experimentally . to address this problem",
    ", we numerically simulate the bls effect from acoustic waves and show that the intensity of the bls signal can be increased by exploiting higher - order plasmon modes supported by the dipole optical antenna .        while there are many different optical antenna designs @xcite , we focus our attention on dipole antennae that consist of a single nanorod made of silver .",
    "we are interested not only in the response of the dipole antenna to the fundamental resonance , but also to higher - order plasmon modes .",
    "our focus on higher - order modes is to ultimately monitor backscattered acoustic radiation from biological tissue and bodily fluids , but also to detect nonlinear acoustic responses from such media @xcite , which affords new sensing opportunities @xcite . by using an ultrasmall optical antenna , rather than traditional mm - size , ultrasound transducers ,",
    "we see new opportunities for ivpa imaging @xcite .",
    "the existence of higher - order plasmon modes of dipole optical antennae have been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed by several groups ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "these modes have been shown to be analogous to the modes of a fabry - perot resonator .",
    "this analogy comes from the fact that these modes arise from multiple reflections between the two ends of the antenna @xcite .",
    "most significantly , lower radiative losses associated with these modes lead to a higher local field confinement as compared with the fundamental mode .",
    "in particular , this property is attractive for the detection of weak dielectric permittivity fluctuations of the liquid around the antenna caused by ultrasound .",
    "we will exploit this property in the remainder of the paper .    finally ,",
    "although we are interested in linear and nonlinear acoustic transduction , it is also important to stress that our antennae can demonstrate optical nonlinearities @xcite . by numerical simulations we demonstrate the possibility to optically excite the antenna by the near - infrared radiation but probe the acoustic waves with light at the frequency of the third harmonic ( th ) of the optical excitation signal [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "this is achievable by designing the antenna such that the frequencies of one of its higher - order plasmon modes coincides with the frequency of the th signal .",
    "most significantly , a strong local field associated with the higher - order modes leads to a considerable enhancement of the th signal in close vicinity to the antenna surface .",
    "this makes the antenna more sensitive to the fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity of the liquid that surrounds the antenna and transmits acoustic waves .",
    "such nonlinear optical signal conversion can be advantageous in practical situations when the operation at shorter wavelengths is preferable due to specific absorption properties of biological tissues or liquids that are being insonified by ultrasound .",
    "moreover , the third harmonic generation ( thg ) itself can be used as an independent bioimaging modality @xcite that can complement the ivpa imaging .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in subsection [ model equations ]",
    "we present a general theory of nonlinear acoustic wave propagation in bulk water , which is chosen as the model liquid surrounding the optical antenna .",
    "based on this theory , we develop an acoustic finite - difference time - domain ( a - fdtd ) method , which allows calculating the spatial profiles of the scalar pressure field @xmath1 and the vector velocity field @xmath2 around the antenna .",
    "these profiles allow us to understand the properties of the optical antenna to scatter acoustic waves . in subsection",
    "[ fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity of liquid caused by acoustic waves ] , from the simulated profiles of the acoustic fields we extract the acoustically - driven dynamics of the fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity of water , which is then used in our in - house optical finite - difference time - domain ( o - fdtd ) method modified to simulate the bls spectra by taking into account the extremely slow dynamics of acoustics waves as compared with light . in subsection [ plasmon - enhanced brillouin light scattering ] , we demonstrate the enhancement of the bls signal due to the higher - order plasmon modes of the antenna .",
    "finally , in section [ design of the optical antenna ] , we discuss a potential practical scheme of the excitation of the higher - order modes of the antenna by means of nonlinear optical effects .",
    "we also present numerical details of the a - fdtd and o - fdtd methods in appendix a and appendix b , respectively .",
    "we explore the plasmon - assisted enhancement of the intensity of peaks arising in the spectral response of the optical antenna due to the bls from acoustic waves , which propagate in bulk liquid that surrounds the antenna . to model the optical response of the antenna we employ the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method that is one of the standard numerical approaches employed in electrodynamics and photonics @xcite .",
    "finite - difference algorithms are also often used to solve acoustic wave propagation and scattering @xcite .",
    "conceptually , the acoustic fdtd ( a - fdtd ) is similar to optical fdtd ( o - fdtd ) .",
    "this is because both approaches are based on first - order differential equations where the temporal derivative of one field is related to the spatial derivative of another field .",
    "thus , it is theoretically possible to merge the two fdtd algorithms to self - consistently solve the problem of bls from acoustic waves in the presence of the optical antenna .    in practice a rigorous self - consistent numerical solution that combines o - fdtd and a - fdtd",
    "is very challenging because the acoustic frequency ( e.g. , @xmath3 mhz ) and the speed of sound ( e.g , @xmath4 m / s ) are widely disparate from those of light ( @xmath5 thz and @xmath6 m / s ) .",
    "hence , the numerical fdtd model effectively has two very different time scales .",
    "the first time scale is at the rapidly varying electromagnetic ( light ) frequency .",
    "the second time scale is the slowly varying acoustic frequency . as a result ,",
    "the electromagnetic solution reaches a steady state solution before the liquid state has changed substantially due to the propagation of the acoustic wave .    inspired by the theoretical approach presented in ref .",
    ", we circumvent the problem of different time scales by considering hypersonic acoustic waves that have ghz frequencies @xcite , instead of ultrasonic wave having several orders of magnitude lower frequencies . in many liquids ,",
    "such waves can be excited by a laser pulse @xcite or piezoelectric film transducers @xcite .",
    "importantly , in liquids the general properties of hypersonic waves are similar to those of ultrasonic waves .",
    "hence , the propagation of hypersonic waves can be studied by using conventional acoustic approaches @xcite . in the framework of our numerical model ,",
    "the consideration of hypersonic waves instead of ultrasonic ones allows us to reduce , to some extent , the mismatch between the time scales of the o - fdtd and a - fdtd models .",
    "this eventually makes a full - vectorial three - dimensional @xmath7d numerical model solvable when using high - performance computers .",
    "however , a more systematic analysis carried out in this paper has required us to additionally reduce the dimensionality of the acoustic model to two - dimensions ( @xmath8d ) .    for our purposes , we assume that our antenna is made of silver and it is surrounded by bulk water .",
    "this assumption is done without loss of generality because silver is often used as the model material of optical antennae , and water is present in many practical situations including the propagation of ultrasound in biological objects .",
    "moreover , silver is used as the constituent material of nanoparticles employed as contrast agents for ivpa imaging @xcite .    the propagation of acoustic waves in water ( as well as in blood , fat , and other biological tissues and liquids )",
    "is governed by the equations of nonlinear acoustics derived from the full system of governing equations of fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed , differences between water and other fluids and materials is likely to be the ultimate sensing target of a final device and could , in principle , be treated with the approaches we outline below .",
    "the speed of the longitudinal acoustic wave @xmath9 in water ( silver ) is @xmath4 m / s ( @xmath10 m / s ) and the density of water ( silver ) is @xmath11 kg / m@xmath12 ( @xmath13 kg / m@xmath12 ) .",
    "these parameters are taken into account by the model equations of nonlinear acoustics in liquids",
    ".    however , silver also support transverse acoustic waves , the speed of which is smaller than that of longitudinal waves .",
    "the speed of transverse waves is a material parameter taken into account in the equations of elastodynamics , which have to be solved if acoustic vibrations of the optical antenna are of interest .",
    "it is noteworthy that in optical antennae the frequency of these vibrations is @xmath14 ghz or even higher , which depends on the antenna dimensions @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we neglect such vibrations , and thus we do not consider the elasticity equations in our model , which assumes that the water acoustic waves interact with the silver antenna as with a rigid body . this approximation is warranted because the acoustic impedance of silver is much higher than that of water @xcite .",
    "another reason to neglect the acoustic vibrations of the antenna is the fact that we consider ghz - range hypersonic waves instead of ultrasonic waves ( see above ) .",
    "we project the results obtained for the hypersonic waves to the case of acoustic waves having lower frequencies , at which the acoustic vibrations of the ultrasmall antenna are negligible .",
    "this latter approximation is also warranted because the dimensions of the antenna are small as compared with the wavelength of acoustic vibrations in the khz and mhz spectral ranges . indeed ,",
    "acoustic vibrations at these frequencies are possible in optomechanical micro - cavities whose characteristic dimensions reach @xmath15 @xmath16 m @xcite , i.e. @xmath17 times larger than an optical antenna .",
    "we begin with the continuity equation , which links the vector velocity vector @xmath18 to the instantaneous density of liquid @xmath19 as @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the time .",
    "the second equation is the momentum equation : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the thermodynamic pressure , @xmath24 the shear viscosity , and @xmath25 the bulk viscosity .",
    "the third , the thermodynamic equation of state , relates three physical quantities describing the thermodynamic behaviour of the liquid .",
    "these quantities can be @xmath23 , @xmath19 , and the temperature @xmath26 . alternatively , they can be @xmath23 , @xmath19 , and the specific entropy @xmath27",
    ". normally , one applies a taylor expansion about the equilibrium state , which to second order is @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the dynamic pressure , density , and entropy , respectively .",
    "these quantities describe small disturbances relative to the uniform state of rest .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath9 are the nonlinear parameter of the medium and the ` small signal ' speed of sound , respectively .",
    "the fourth equation is the entropy equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath35 is the delta function . the last term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : four ] is written in cartesian tensor notation .    by keeping the first and second order terms in eqs .",
    "[ eq : one]-[eq : four ] , we obtain the following nonlinear equations .",
    "the continuity equation is @xmath36 and the momentum equation is reexpressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the second - order lagrangian density .",
    "the entropy equation can be simplified to @xmath39 where @xmath40 the temperature of the medium at rest .",

    "[ eq : seven ] to eq .",
    "[ eq : three ] and the use of thermodynamic relationships , one can write the equation of state as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the specific heat capacities at constant volume and pressure , respectively . we note that for a variety of liquids the constants used in eqs .",
    "[ eq : one]-[eq : eigth ] have been tabulated in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is also important to derive the linearised acoustic equations .",
    "these equations serve as the departure point for the derivation of the discrete finite - difference analogues of nonlinear equations eqs .",
    "[ eq : one]-[eq : eigth ] . in many cases",
    "it is instructive to start the analysis with the solution of the linear equations , and then to proceed with the solution of the nonlinear equations , as the linearised equations are easier to discretise and solve using the basic finite - difference formulations than their nonlinear counterparts @xcite . additionally , the linear equations are also important because at the boundaries of the computational domain it is technically impossible to impose absorbing boundary conditions when using the nonlinear equations @xcite .",
    "the absorbing boundary conditions is a standard approach that is used in the framework of the fdtd method to simulate the propagation of waves either in free space or in a medium in which the waves are fully attenuated before they can experience reflection from boundaries .",
    "keeping only the term of the first order , the linearised continuity equation eq .",
    "[ eq : one ] becomes @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the density of the undisturbed medium .",
    "similarly , the momentum equation eq .",
    "[ eq : two ] becomes @xmath46 the linearised equation of state eq .",
    "[ eq : three ] becomes @xmath47    our discrete numerical model is based on the standard finite - difference stencils employed in the fdtd method @xcite .",
    "the finite - difference analogues of both linear and nonlinear model equations are given in appendix a.      the simulation of bls from an acoustic wave requires one to define the time dependences of the fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity cased by the acoustic wave propagating in the liquid .",
    "this can be done by calculating the profiles of the acoustic scalar pressure field _",
    "p _ and the vector velocity field * v*. to start with , we calculate these profile for the linear case , i.e. we neglect the nonlinear acoustic effects .",
    "once the behaviour of the dielectric permittivity in the linear case has been understood , we will take into account the nonlinear effects .",
    "so far , we have not discussed the particular design of the optical antenna .",
    "we assume that the antenna consists of a silver nanorod , which has a square - cross section @xmath48  nm and length @xmath49  nm .",
    "this choice of parameters is due to optimisation using o - fdtd simulations , and is discussed in more detail in section [ design of the optical antenna ] .    in the a - fdtd model , the antenna is insonified by a plain quasi - monochromatic acoustic pressure wave propagating in bulk water .",
    "the peak amplitude of this wave is @xmath50  mpa , which is consistent with the pressure level used in nonlinear intravascular contrast imaging @xcite . in the time - domain ,",
    "the profile of this wave is given by a very long gaussian pulse modulated by a sinusoidal wave .",
    "the pulse length was @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the time step in the a - fdtd algorithm .",
    "the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the simulated profiles of @xmath53 in close proximity to the antenna for the acoustic frequencies @xmath54 , @xmath50 , and @xmath3 ghz .",
    "these profiles were obtained by fourier - transforming the dependencies @xmath2 produced by the a - fdtd method .",
    "the contours of the antenna are outlined by the white @xmath49 nm @xmath55 @xmath56 nm rectangle , which also serves as the scalebar .",
    "we also calculate the displacement field @xmath57 , which is the displacement of a particle from its equilibrium position due to the acoustic wave , at the same frequencies as above by @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath57 by means of the a - fdtd method is relatively simple when the incident signal is quasi - monochromatic .    as a next step ,",
    "we calculate the divergence of the displacement field @xmath59 , as shown in the right column of fig .",
    "the amplitude of dynamic fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity of water @xmath60 caused by the propagating acoustic wave is directly proportional to @xmath59 , as shown in ref .  .",
    "this is because in the case of the plain longitudinal acoustic waves , the liquid is alternately compressed and stretched , which gives rise to alternating density changes .",
    "the knowledge of the changes in the dielectric permittivity is required to simulate the bls from acoustic waves by means of the o - fdtd method .",
    "we estimate that in our model the amplitude of @xmath60 is @xmath61 .",
    "one can see that the spatial profile of @xmath59 is quasi - uniform at the acoustic frequency @xmath54 ghz .",
    "this is because the wavelength of the acoustic wave in water is @xmath62 times larger than the dimensions of the antenna . as a result",
    ", the acoustic wave is weakly scattered by the antenna .",
    "consequently , the profile of the velocity @xmath18 is quasi - uniform , which implies that in close proximity to the antenna @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the profile of @xmath60 is quasi - uniform , too .",
    "the same result holds for lower frequencies ( not shown ) .",
    "however , at higher frequencies the profile of @xmath59 becomes less uniform .",
    "this can be seen at @xmath62 ghz , i.e. when the acoustic wavelength @xmath64 nm is close to the length of antenna . moreover , at frequencies @xmath65 ghz the profile is no longer uniform ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , right column ) . consequently ,",
    "if the frequency is @xmath66 ghz , which is the case of our study , we will abstract from the fact that we simulate the propagation of the ghz - range hypersonic waves . instead",
    ", we will consider the normalised acoustic frequency @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the frequency of the fundamental harmonic of the incident wave .",
    "this approach allows us to project our results to the case of ultrasonic waves .",

    "@xmath49  @xmath55  @xmath56  nm .",
    "the black ( yellow ) colour denotes the zero ( maximum ) of the profile intensity .",
    "the direction of the incident monochromatic pressure wave is indicated by the arrow .",
    "note that the velocity @xmath53 in front of ( behind ) the antenna increases ( decreases ) , which also changes the profile of @xmath59 .",
    "this is because of the pressure doubling effect @xcite.,width=245 ]    we now consider nonlinear acoustic effects .",
    "to do so , in our a - fdtd software we turn on the acoustic nonlinearity by setting @xmath71 , which corresponds to the nonlinear acoustic parameter of water @xcite . as shown in appendix a , the nonlinearity is present in the @xmath70d model only .",

    "the distortion due to the nonlinear propagation signal is detected at the output of the @xmath70d model and used as the excitation source in the same @xmath8d model employed to produce the results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in general , the distorted signal carries energy at the fundamental frequency @xmath68 as well as at all harmonics generated due to the nonlinear interaction . it is noteworthy that the amplitude of the generated harmonics depends on the wave propagation distance in the liquid . in our model , this distance equals approximately one quarter of @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the wavelength of the fundamental wave and @xmath74 the acoustic mach number .",
    "the value of @xmath75 corresponds to the distance at which the amplitude of the second nonlinear generated harmonics formally reaches @xmath76 of the amplitude of the fundamental wave @xcite .    the simulated spectrum of the linear acoustic wave is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "it was obtained by fourier - transforming the calculated time - domain dependencies of the pressure @xmath77 detected in the input port of the @xmath70d a - fdtd model . from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and its inset , which shows the same spectrum plotted in the decibel scale , one can see only one peak at the frequency @xmath68 confirming the monochromatic nature of this wave .",

    "[ fig3](b ) one can see new nonlinear generated waves appear in the spectrum at the frequencies @xmath78 ( quadratic nonlinear effect ) , @xmath79 ( cubic effect ) , etc .",
    "this spectrum was obtained by fourier - transforming the values of @xmath77 detected in the output port of the @xmath70d model .",
    "in addition to the harmonic waves , the nonlinear interaction leads to the creation of a dc component ( i.e. zero frequency ) , which can be seen upon a close inspection of the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "we note that the relative amplitudes of the nonlinear generated waves are in good agreement with the predictions of analytical formulae presented in ref .  .",
    "in the nonlinear case , we also extract the time - domain dependencies of the dielectric permittivity fluctuations @xmath80 ( not shown ) .",
    "in contrast to the linear case , these dependencies contain the contributions from the density changes caused by both the fundamental wave and its harmonics .",
    "the contributions of the harmonic waves are small as compared with those of the fundamental wave because their relative magnitudes follow the intensities of the spectral components shown in fig .",

    "furthermore , one can distinguish the dc component ( zero frequency ) generated due to the nonlinear acoustic effect.,width=321 ]      we demonstrate a plasmon - enhanced light - acoustic wave interaction in the presence of the antenna .",
    "the a - fdtd simulations conducted in the previous section [ fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity of liquid caused by acoustic waves ] have produced the time dependences of the dielectric permittivity fluctuations at each discrete point inside the computational domain .",
    "we correlate these points with the discrete points of the computational domain in the o - fdtd method , as explained in appendix b.    we use the theory from refs .   to estimate the frequency of the fundamental ( dipole ) plasmonic mode of the antenna : @xmath82 nm .",
    "the theory also predicts that this antenna should support two higher - order plasmonic modes at @xmath83 and @xmath84 nm , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we also assume that the acoustic waves in water are probed at the frequency of the first higher - order plasmonic mode at @xmath83 nm .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "as will be shown in section [ design of the optical antenna ] , the electric field profiles of the higher - order plasmonic modes exhibit fabry - perot - like behaviour and are tightly confined to the surface of the antenna .",
    "these modes bounce back and forth as they experience multiple reflections from the ends of the antenna .",
    "this behaviour is favourable for the detection of acoustic waves because the multiple passing of light along the antenna surface effectively increases the interaction time of light with the acoustic wave .",
    "furthermore , the tight confinement of the electric field gives rise to an increased sensitivity of the plasmon resonance to any change in the dielectric permittivity occurring in close proximity to the surface of the antenna @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that for numerical tractability we have to make several simplifications , which do not interfere with our analysis but drastically decrease simulation time and simplify the analysis of the plasmon - enhanced bls effect .",
    "firstly , we limit ourselves to the @xmath8d o - fdtd model .",
    "apart from the fact that the a - fdtd model is also @xmath8d , this simplification is warranted because @xmath8d o - fdtd simulations produce qualitatively the same linear spectra as those produced using a @xmath7d model ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "secondly , we assume that the optical signal exciting the antenna does not generate additional acoustic waves in water .",
    "this is because an efficient generation of acoustic waves in water is possible only when one fulfils certain conditions @xcite .",
    "however , those conditions are not met in our model because their fulfilment is out of the scope of this work .",
    "furthermore , we also neglect the impact of the radiation pressure , electrostriction , thermal expansion , and other effects that potentially can give rise to acoustic vibrations of the antenna due to the interaction with the optical radiation .    to start with",
    ", we simulate the effect of bls from a quasi - monochromatic sinusoidal acoustic wave of frequency @xmath68 propagating in the linear medium . in the a - fdtd software ,",
    "we turn off the nonlinearity by setting @xmath85 .",
    "we run the a - fdtd simulation in parallel with the o - fdtd simulation , where the latter receives time - dependent information about the dielectric permittivity fluctuations of water caused by the propagating acoustic wave .",
    "two batches of simulations are conducted : one with the optical antenna in bulk water and another one in bulk water without the antenna .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . in the case without the antenna ( blue curve ) one can see a typical bls spectrum with the the central rayleigh peak and two brillouin peaks shifted from the frequency of the incident light by the frequency of acoustic wave @xmath68 .",
    "importantly , in the presence of the antenna one can see that the intensity of brillouin peaks is enhanced ( red curve ) .",
    "this @xmath86-fold increase with respect to the bls intensity without the antenna is attributed to the plasmon resonance of the antenna . to verify this",
    ", we conducted an extra simulation ( results not shown here ) in which the frequency of the optical signal that excites the antenna was off - resonance . as expected , that simulation produced virtually the same result as without the antenna .",
    "we also note the existence of two additional brillouin peaks shifted from the frequency of the incident light by @xmath78 [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] .",
    "as the acoustic nonlinearities were neglected in the simulation , the appearance of these very weak peaks is attributed to the cascaded scattering of the optical signals at the frequency @xmath87 from the acoustic wave . in this case , the optical waves at @xmath87 act as the incident light but the signals at @xmath88 are the brillouin - shifted waves , which are very weak and visible only in the presence of the antenna .    finally , we simulate the bls from nonlinear acoustic waves in the presence of the antenna .",

    "it is noteworthy that different fabry - perot structures and other types of optical resonators are often used in many practical situations involving the detection of acoustic waves with light ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) .",

    "we also remind that the far - field optical radiation properties of the higher - order plasmonic modes of the antenna are poor as compared with those of the dipole modes . by virtue of the principle of reciprocity @xcite",

    "although the nonlinear susceptibility of silver can be higher than that of water , its neglect is justified by the fact that silver may be oxidised in the presence of water , which is expected to significantly reduce its contribution to the nonlinear response .",

    "we expect to observe a very large enhancement of several orders of magnitude because the intensity of the th signal simulated in the absence of the antenna should be negligibly small due to a very short nonlinear optical interaction length . in our model",
