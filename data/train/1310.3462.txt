    "the qgp viscosity is a hot research topic .",
    "viscous hydrodynamic simulations showed that elliptic flow @xmath0 is very sensitive to the qgp shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath6 .",
    "even the minimum value @xmath7 from the ads / cft correspondence could lead to 20 - 25% suppression of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "generally , the qgp viscosity is extracted from the integrated @xmath0 for all charged hadrons , since it is directly related to the fluid momentum anisotropy and varies monotonously with @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy flow for common hadrons ( pions , kaons and protons ) are developed in both qgp and hadronic stages .",
    "a precise extraction of the qgp viscosity from these soft hadron data requires a sophisticated hybrid model that nicely describes the kinetics and decoupling of the hadronic matter .",
    "in contrast , hadrons contain multiple strange quarks ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and etc . )",
    "are predicted to decouple earlier from the system due to their smaller hadronic cross sections  @xcite .",
    "they may directly probe the qgp phase and can be used to test the qgp viscosity extracted from the elliptic flow of common hadrons  @xcite .",
    "recently , the alice collaboration measured the multiplicity , @xmath8 spectra and elliptic flow for strange and multi - strange hadrons  @xcite , so this is the right time to perform a careful theoretical investigation of these data . in this article , we will briefly report vishnu calculations of the elliptic flow for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 hyperons in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions . detailed investigation of these strange and multi - strange hadrons can be found in the incoming article  @xcite .",
    "the vishnu predictions for the elliptic flow of @xmath9 meson are documented in ref  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical tool used here is vishnu hybrid model  @xcite .",
    "it connects 2 + 1-d hydrodynamics for the viscous qgp fluid expansion to a hadron cascade model for the kinetic evolution of the hadronic matter . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the net baryon density , heat flow and bulk viscosity .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) s95p - pce used for the hydrodynamic evolution is constructed from recent lattice data  @xcite .",
    "the hyper - surface switching between hydrodynamics and the hadron cascade is constructed by a switching temperature at @xmath10 , which is close to the qcd phase transition and chemical freeze - out temperature at top rhic energy .",
    "following ref  @xcite , we use mc - kln initial conditions .",
    "the initial entropy density profiles for selected centralities are generated from mc - kln model through averaging over a large number of fluctuating entropy density distributions with recentering and aligning the reaction plane .",
    "the qgp specific shear viscosity @xmath11 is set to 0.16 , which gives a nice description of @xmath1 for pion , kaon and protons at the lhc  @xcite . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the starting time @xmath13 is 0.9 fm / c , which is obtained from fitting the slope of the @xmath8 spectra for all charged hadrons below 2 gev  @xcite . with these inputs and parameters",
    "fixed , we predict the elliptic flow for strange and multi - strange bayons in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions .",
    "hybrid model is a successful tool to describe and predict the soft hadron productions at rhic and the lhc . using vishnu  @xcite , we extracted the qgp specific shear viscosity from the integrated elliptic flow for all charged hadrons in 200 a gev au+au collisions and found @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , where the uncertainties are dominated by the undetermined initial conditions from mc - glauber and mc - kln models  @xcite . with that extracted qgp viscosity",
    ", vishnu gives a nice description of the @xmath8 spectra and elliptic flow for all charged and identified hadrons at rhic  @xcite .",
    "@xcite extrapolates the vishnu calculations to the lhc and shows that vishnu could nicely describe the @xmath8 spectra and elliptic flow for all charged hadrons with mc - kln initial conditions and @xmath16 , a slightly higher value than the one extracted at rhic with mc - kln initial conditions . with the identified soft hadron data becoming available , we further calculated the multiplicity , @xmath8 spectra and differential elliptic flow for pions kaons and protons and found these @xmath1 prefer @xmath12 for mc - kln  @xcite .",
    "it is noticed that the integrated and differential elliptic flow for all charged hadrons are measured by 4 particle cumulants method ( @xmath17 ) , while the elliptic flow for identified hadrons are measured by scalar product method ( @xmath18 ) based on 2 particle correlations . comparing with @xmath17 , non - flow and fluctuations",
    "raise the flow signal of @xmath18 , leading to a slightly lower value of @xmath11 to fit @xmath18 data for identified hadrons .",
    "recently , the alice collaboration measured the elliptic flow for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions using scalar product method  @xcite . using vishnu hybrid model , we calculate the differential elliptic flow @xmath1 for these strange and multi - strange hadrons . here",
    "we choose @xmath12 , mc - kln initial conditions and other parameter sets as used in early calculations  @xcite that nicely describe the soft hadron data for pions kaons and protons at the lhc .",
    "1 shows that vishnu nicely describes @xmath0(@xmath8 ) data for @xmath3 and @xmath4 from central to peripheral collisions and nicely describes @xmath2 data at 10% and 40% centralities as measured by alice . due to the very low particle yields ,",
    "the elliptic flow for @xmath4 has large error bars in alice data and the vishnu results . for better comparisons ,",
    "the statistics for @xmath4 should be further increased in both experimental and theoretical sides .",
    "fig .  2 further explores the mass - ordering of elliptic flow among various hadrons in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions .",
    "radial flow tends to push low @xmath8 hadrons to higher transverse momenta .",
    "such effects are more efficient for heavier particles , leading to the mass - ordering of @xmath0 as predicted in hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "comparing with @xmath1 for all charge hadrons , the mass - splitting of @xmath0 among various hadrons reflects the interplay of the radial and elliptic flow during hadronic evolution , which is more sensitive to details of theoretical calculations .",
    "2 shows that , within current statistics , vishnu roughly reproduces the @xmath0 mass ordering among @xmath5 , k , p , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in semi - central collisions , but gives an inverse mass - ordering between p and @xmath2 for the two selected ( 10 - 20% and 40 - 50% ) centralities .",
    "early osu calculations  @xcite , using pure viscous hydrodynamics vish2 + 1 , nicely predicts the mass ordering among @xmath5 , k , p , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 as measured in experiments later on , but over - predicts the elliptic flow for proton and @xmath2 at 10 - 20% centrality bin . with the microscopic description of hadronic rescatterings and evolution",
    ", vishnu hybrid model improves the descriptions of the elliptic flow for proton and @xmath2 , while the slightly under - predicts of the proton @xmath1 below 2 gev lead to an inverse mass ordering of @xmath0 between p and @xmath2 . to improve the description of @xmath1 for proton as well as for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the related hadronic cross sections in urqmd need to be improved . on the other hand , to further understand these rare multi - strange hadrons and to test theoretical models , the statistics for @xmath3 and @xmath4 need to be increased in both experimental and theoretical sides . +",
    "in this proceeding , we present vishnu hybrid model calculations of the elliptic flow for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions .",
