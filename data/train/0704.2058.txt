    "moses _ stereoscopic imaging , but there are two key differences : there is only a single spectral line in the instrument passband , and it is an absorption line ; and the line width is narrower than a pixel in dispersion .",

    "the step is located at position 100 .",
    "the high - pass response to the differential stereoscopy signal ( dark blue ) is due to the interaction between the differentiation inherent in the detection method , and the `` imperfect '' ( high - pass ) integration imposed by the @xmath30@xmath31 decay term in the integrand of eq .",

    "[ eq : discrete inversion ] operates best on spatial frequencies less than 2/3 of the pixel nyquist frequency , because the reconstructed amplitude of those frequency components is independent of their phase relative to the pixel grid .",

    "errors in both the measurement of intensity and the inversion affect the analysis , so that the measured @xmath31 is not exactly the same as @xmath21 even if the image frequency spectrum is appropriately limited . in this error analysis",
    "we consider six principal sources of error : photon counting noise , @xmath46 , that represents an additive , uncorrelated noise source at each pixel in each of the differential and correlation stereoscopy steps ; misalignment noise @xmath47 in the cross - correlation step ; the effect of intensity gradients ( both @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) on the line shift signal ; a nonzero slope @xmath50 of the instrument filter transmission function @xmath11 ( the slope is assumed to be zero in eq .",
    "[ eq : hybrid_inversion ] ) ; and an excessively high @xmath22 signal in the solar image .",
    "the first two noise sources arise ( directly or indirectly ) from imprecision in the measurement of @xmath51 in each pixel , and the last four sources arise from the non - ideal nature of the instrument and/or the solar field being imaged . in the following subsections",
    "we treat each error source independently .",
    "photon counting noise is due to uncertainty in the measured intensity @xmath28 in each focal plane , through the statistics of photon counting .",
    "each measurement does not determine intensity directly , but rather fluence of energy ( or , equivalently , photon count ) on each pixel during an exposure time .",
    "intensity can be derived by knowing the size of the pixel and the length of the exposure .",
    "each pixel measures a fluence @xmath52 with an uncertainty @xmath53 given by:@xmath54 so that the rms value @xmath55 .",
    "this effect contributes to @xmath31 primarily via a photon noise term that must be propagated through equation [ eq : discrete inversion ] : the much higher photon counts in many - pixel image `` patches '' greatly reduce photon counting noise in the cross - correlation portion of the inversion (  [ sub : misalignment - noise ] ) .",
    "the rms photon noise contribution @xmath56 is just the incoherent sum of the photon noise terms in each term on the rhs of eq .",
    "[ eq : discrete inversion ] . each of those terms , in turn , is ( to first order in @xmath57 and neglecting @xmath58 for the calculation of noise in each pixel):@xmath59 where @xmath60 is the per - exposure photon count in the corresponding pixel in each of the two orders .",
    "[ eq : delta_ph j ] simply reproduces the familiar behavior of incoherent counting statistics for intrinsic ( normalized ) quantities .",
    "the treatment may , at first glance , appear overly simple as the individual pixels in the images are interpolated and hence do not represent individual samples of the @xmath61 random variable but rather scaled incoherent sums of adjacent samples .",
    "this is acceptable to ignore because , in the absence of strong gradients in @xmath62 ( i.e. gradients comparable to unity per pixel ) , the samples noise profile is preserved by the inversion .",
    "adjacent pixels are co - added in the discrete inversion . under linear interpolation , adjacent interpolated fractions of the signal from each detector pixel are approximately conserved by the interpolation and added coherently in the cross - pixel sum in eq .",
    "[ eq : discrete inversion ] . because addition is commutative",
    ", the noise effect of the interpolated pixels on the final sum is the same as if no interpolation had taken place , up to a negligible factor of @xmath63 ) . put another way , although considering interpolation would further reduce the noise in @xmath64 for individual pixels , co - adding @xmath64 for adjacent pixels in the inversion eq .",
    "[ eq : discrete inversion ] would then include coherent cross - pixel noise terms that would exactly cancel the reduction ",
    "so we may safely choose , instead , to ignore the effects of the @xmath29 interpolation and use incoherent sums throughout .",
    "carrying eq .",
    "[ eq : delta_ph j ] forward through eq .",
    "[ eq : discrete inversion ] yields:@xmath65 neglecting any field edge effects ( in other words , taking @xmath66 ) permits taking the infinite sums directly , yielding ( to first order in epsilon):@xmath67 thus the statistics of the differential stereoscopy step are worsened by the width of the correction term .",
    "this is reflective of the fact that random walks diverge , and is the reason for using a hybrid inversion rather than a direct integral inversion : using direct integration in equation [ eq : discrete inversion ] , rather than high - pass integration with correction , is equivalent to setting @xmath30 to zero , which would yield an arbitrarily large amount of photon - counting noise in the individual measurements . in actual use , it is necessary to balance @xmath30 and the cross correlation patch size : larger patch sizes improve correlation behavior but require smaller @xmath30 and thus worsen the photon noise due to integration of the differential signal .",
    "it is important to note that the photon noise from the discrete inversion is not independently sampled at each pixel : it is the sum of many noise terms along the @xmath4 direction , so that the _ difference _ measurement between adjacent pixels has a much smaller noise level , yielding higher precision for small features .",
    "in particular , shifting by 1 pixel re - samples only one @xmath68 of the population of random samples in the calculated @xmath31 , reducing the photon noise by a factor of @xmath69 so that small features are only subject to : @xmath70 which is to be expected considering that the difference signal is the original signal being measured by the differential stereoscopy - the difference in measured wavelength between two adjacent pixels is simply a linearly scaled form of @xmath64 .",
    "differential stereoscopy is _ more sensitive _ to small features than to large ones , at least from the standpoint of photon statistics .",
    "taking `` typical '' values of @xmath71 ( fwhm of 15 pixels ) , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 yields an absolute partial sensitivity @xmath74 pixel , and a gradient sensitivity @xmath75 ( the gradient sensitivity is unitless : pixels per pixel ) , due to photon counting alone .",
    "the second source of error in equation [ eq : discrete inversion ] is misalignment in the cross correlation step that is used to derive @xmath29 from the original images . in the 2004 derivation of eq .",
    "[ eq : hybrid_inversion ] , it was necessary to assume that the displacement of the images was small , leading to @xmath58 terms that enter in first order because the + 1 and -1 order intensities are measured at slightly different spatial locations . here , we consider the effect of small misalignments due to errors in the correlation co - alignment process . in the test measurements made by deforest et al .",
    ", the cross - correlation step used a full two - dimensional patch of image around each sampled point , rather than ( as in the differential stereoscopic portion of the inversion ) merely the particular horizontal line surrounding each point .",
    "this is reasonable in part because the image is , in fact , a two - dimensional field rather than a collection of independent rasters ; and in part because the technique was found empirically to reduce correlation `` misses '' and improve the image signal . here , we consider the potential sources of error injected by cross - correlation alignment of patches of image around each point .    because correlation co - alignment is a nonlinear process and depends on the field in the image",
    ", it is necessary to make some assumptions about the field being viewed .",
    "we here confine our analysis to magnetic measurements of the quiet sun , which consists principally of nearly uniformly bright granules separated by dark , well defined lanes .",
    "some other types of field ( for example , the uv chromospheric network ) are analogous and may be considered with the same or similar analysis , but other types of field ( such as sunspot penumbrae ) are likely too complex for simple analysis and require numerical modeling .",
    "sample correlation field used for our correlation photon analysis .",
    "correlation between two images is used to align two patches of pixels with radius @xmath76 .",
    "the image field consists of dark lanes against a background of approximately uniform brightness ( left ) .",
    "the lanes consist of side - walls with thickness @xmath77 and depth @xmath78 ( right ) .",
    "a fraction @xmath79 of the image is considered to be lane wall.,width=288 ]    in this analysis we consider cross - correlation of an idealized small patch of quiet sun with @xmath80 pixels , of nearly uniform intrinsic brightness everywhere except in a fraction @xmath79 of the pixels of which are occupied by narrow , dark features with steep sides that are , on average , @xmath77 pixels across , and an absolute intensity deficit of @xmath78 ( figure . for typical quiet - sun visible light observations , @xmath79is about 0.1 and @xmath78is about @xmath81 .",
    "assuming that the correlation algorithm does not miss ( it achieves a match between corresponding features in the opposite order images ) , we assume that errors in the resulting overall position of the patches is due to randomization errors from the displacements ( real and apparent ) of the dark features between the two images . in the worst non - pathological case ,",
    "every intensity feature in the image patch is displaced by a different random amount , representing a strong high - spatial - frequency field . in that case , each feature s apparent location is the incoherent sum of two random variable samples : one due to photon counting statistics in the sloping sides of the feature , and one due to the random displacements of the features themselves .",
    "the former depends on the steepness of feature sides , the overall brightness of the image , and the number of pixels in each feature wall .",
    "the latter depends on the dispersion of the instrument and the variability of spectral offset across the image    the uncertainty in location of each feature due to photon counting statistics is related to the slope at the sides of the feature : correlation fitting converts intensity in the sloping sides of a feature to position , so we can estimate the position / wavelength noise due to error in the intensity , by simply scaling the intensity noise to account for this conversion .",
    "the cross - correlation requires comparison between two features , so one can write:@xmath82 where @xmath83 is the uncertainty in brightness in the side - of - feature pixels , and the right - hand expression accounts for the typical number of pixels in the sides of a particular feature .",
    "the @xmath60 comes from the fraction @xmath84and is the number of photons counted during the exposure .",
    "the unitless @xmath85 arises because the average brightness in a feature sidewall is halfway between the background intensity and the dark feature intensity , the extra factor of 2 under the radical comes from the fact that the noise in offset is the incoherent sum of the location noise in each of the two features being compared .",
    "the ensemble average error position @xmath86 is then just the incoherent average of the offsets of each feature wall , or @xmath87 taking the patch to be about 15 pixels across , and assuming a scene of solar granulation with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath73 yields a noise estimate of @xmath91 pixels .",
    "photon noise in the correlation step is hence negligible compared to photon noise in the differential step .",
    "this is not surprising considering the large number of pixels that are averaged over by the correlation step . put another way , the noise spectrum is dominated by high spatial frequencies , which are `` smoothed out '' by the correlation process .",
    "there is an additional source of error in the correlation step : because the wavelength signal @xmath15 includes high spatial frequencies ( the signal that is being measured by the differential stereoscopy step ) , different parts of the image must be shifted in different directions to find the average offset over the entire patch being correlated .",
    "these high spatial frequencies introduce an error into the measurement of the shifts @xmath16 , because the correlation step weights the importance of the different offsets according to the average sidewall slope in each portion of the patch being correlated , rather than uniformly throughout the patch of image .",
    "this error term is independent of the photon noise , and is introduced even for successful cross - correlations .",
    "it depends on the inequality of the weighting of the features , as well as the amount of displacement:@xmath92 where @xmath93 is used to indicate actual differences from the patch - wide mean ( different from @xmath94which is being used to indicate statistical error in a quantity ) , @xmath95 is the signed difference between @xmath21 at each location in the patch being correlated and the mean for the whole patch , @xmath58 is the slope of the intensity function at each location in the image , and @xmath96 is the difference between the current value of the slope and its patch - wide average . as above ,",
    "angle - brackets symbolize rms averaging over a complete data set ; here , an over bar is used to represent signed averaging over the patch .",
    "the inclusion of both @xmath93-quantities ( on the rhs ) and @xmath6-quantities ( on the lhs ) is because eq .",

    "[ eq : weighting - delta ] depends only on the scene being viewed .",
    "the signed average simply applies an @xmath97 scaling of the overall error term , according to the number of independent samples @xmath98 of image data in the patch .",

    "two principal types of error enter into the measurement : random or quasi - random noise as described in   [ sub : photon - counting - noise]-[sub : image - brightness - gradients ] ; and calibration nonlinearities that enter as a result of filter detuning and the first - order stereoscopic inversion as described in   [ sub : filter - passband - gradients]-[sub : rapid - variation - of ] .",
    ".[tab : additive - budget]noise budget for a sample stereoscopic magnetograph measurement as described in the text .",
    "this measurement would have ~ 6 g rms noise even in field - free regions of the sun , and 3%-12% calibration errors in the measured flux of small magnetized regions of 100 - 1000 g , no more than a few pixels across . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     because of the multiple sources of error , calculation of error budgets for actual observations must be carried out on a case - by - case basis ; however , we note that for magnetograph observations of the photosphere , the dominant noise term is ( as expected ) photon noise for a plausible instrument setup and a range of targets that includes most non - sunspot - related targets on the sun .",
    "the expected formal single - exposure magnetogram sensitivity is ~10 gauss ( twice the rms background noise level ) and the expected magnetic flux calibration accuracy is expected to be close to 10% in most cases including plage .",
    "the error budget in table [ tab : additive - budget ] is broadly consistent with test measurements collected by deforest et al .",
    "( 2004 ) at the dunn solar telescope . in those measurements , exposures of only @xmath218 photons were collected ; 16 exposures were combined to create each image for an effective exposure of @xmath219 photons ; and an _ asymmetric _ inversion ( whose sensitivity was reduced by a factor of @xmath217 compared to the symmetric inversion discussed here ) was used .",
    "the resulting calculated photon noise level is thus a factor of @xmath220 higher than shown here , or 9.5 g ( 0.45 g for the correlation noise ) , and the non - photon noise sources are scaled up a factor of @xmath217 compared to the sample measurement described here .",
    "this leads to a total _ a priori _ noise level estimate of 10 g for that measurement .",
    "indeed , in a small quiet region with no detected flux features , deforest et al . found _ a posteriori _ rms noise levels between 9 - 12 gauss , in good agreement with the current _ a priori _ calculation .",
    "we have calculated a detailed noise budget for hybrid differential inversion of the line - shift signal from a stereoscopic spectrograph , with specific application as a stereoscopic magnetograph observing a specific absorption line ( fe i 617.34 nm ) in the solar photosphere .",
    "the noise budget is photon dominated and careful _ a priori _ analysis shows that it offers similar calibration performance to existing and past filtergraph ( soho / mdi , @xcite ) and fourier tachometer ( gong ; @xcite ) instruments ( @xcite ) : instrument response to field is within a few to ten percent of linear over a wide range of pixel - averaged field strengths .",
    "the principal difference between the stereoscopic technique and the filtergraph or fourier tachometer techniques is that the instrument can operate much more rapidly , because all required photons are collected simultaneously in a dual - polarized - beam instrument .",
    "this is very important for ground based observations in which atmospheric seeing effects severely limit the precision with which line shifts can be measured in time - multiplexing instruments such as filtergraphs .",
    "some instruments , such as zimpol ( @xcite ) , have been able to limit crosstalk of atmospheric effects by multiplexing extremely rapidly ; but such instruments are still subject to motion blur even in the absence of severe crosstalk .",
    "a stereoscopic spectral imager should be able to acquire a diffraction limited magnetogram with few - gauss sensitivity in a small fraction of a second at most major observing facilities .",
    "we expect this rapidity of acquisition to become important even in space - based observing as higher resolution instruments ( e.g. _ hinode / sot _ ; @xcite ) release data to the scientific community : the race between solar evolution and data acquisition ( photon counting ) give rise to a tradeoff between sensitivity and spatial resolution for any spectral imager , even above the atmosphere .    particularly for features that are spatially small , stereoscopic imagers offer a surprising advantage : because the fundamental signal extracted from the images is proportional to the _ spatial derivative _ of the line shift signal , such instruments are particularly sensitive to small features , right down to the spatial resolution of the measurement . like dolby@xmath221 noise reduction for audio recordings ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", spatial derivative measurement enhances high spatial frequencies , boosting the high frequency signal relative to the photon noise floor .",
    "conventional spectral measurements sample each location in the image plane independently , so that in a roughly circular feature of linear size @xmath19 and area @xmath222 the uncertainty due to photon counting in the feature s total magnetic flux scales as @xmath223 or @xmath224 . in a differential stereoscopic measurement , the _ average slope _ uncertainty , rather than the total flux uncertainty , scales as @xmath224",
    "so the total flux uncertainty is independent of feature size for features smaller than the correlation patches described in section [ sec : summary-&-specific ] .",
    "stereoscopic spectral imaging is a special case of the more general technique of _ spectral tomography _ ( e.g. @xcite ) , and appears to offer significant advantages in the regime we have described : observations of a narrow spectral line , where only one or two moments of the line are desired to be measured .",
    "spectral tomography using regularized inverse or conjugate analysis techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) could potentially be used to extract much more information about the spectrum , using multiple orders or , as did wilson et al . , crossed gratings ; but as the number of additional channels grows , so do the potential paths for signal contamination and crosstalk between different aspects of the measured spectrum .",
    "we conclude that stereoscopic techniques represent a sweet spot for imaged doppler or magnetic measurements of solar scenes , offering superior photon efficiency and comparable performance to filtergraph measurements .",
    "this is already important as ground - based spectral imagers are already photon - starved near the diffraction limit in existing meter - class telescopes ( such as the dunn solar telescope , @xcite , and the swedish vacuum tower , @xcite ) and will grow more so near the diffraction limit of future telescopes such as the four - meter advanced technology solar telescope ( @xcite ) .",
