    "the study of bubble nucleation and growth is a broad field of study with rich physics@xcite . some of the more recent examples include experimental and theoretical studies of superfluid helium in a superheated state@xcite , and the theoretical study of nucleation of magnetic bubbles@xcite . in this paper",
    "we look at the problem of the quantum description of bubble growth in superheated liquid helium .",
    "this is just one example of many systems whose classical nature is well known but whose quantum representation is not .",
    "the fact that not all functions can be quantized uniquely into operators in the hilbert space has been known for some time .",
    "the groenewald - van hove theorem has explicitly shown that dirac s program of assigning operators to all functions by having the poisson brackets change into commutators works only for polynomials of quadratic form or less@xcite .    in the case of superheated liquid helium ,",
    "the difficulty in quantization appears in the form of a position dependent mass ( pdm ) , whereby the kinetic term in the classical hamiltonian is space dependent .",
    "in fact , many systems in nature have the pdm structure ; for instance , free carriers , such as electrons , in semiconductors of non - uniform chemical composition are often described by a pdm hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "other examples of pdm appear in various instances of nuclear many - body problems , quantum dots , and nano - mechanical systems just to name a few@xcite . as a result",
    "there have been a number of attempts to address the issue of operator ordering ambiguities due to pdm , using the gallileian transformation and other methods@xcite .",
    "we aim in the present paper to provide insight into several existing techniques in quantization , their convergence and possible future usage .",
    "in particular , we show in this paper how to apply the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) formalism@xcite which have been previously applied to solve simpler pdm problems@xcite .",
    "the main difference is that , unlike the usual examples of susy qm , our hamiltonian contains a specific potential which is not easily factorizable ; the method presented in this paper shows how one may apply susy qm to a more general situation .",
    "on the other hand , we apply to our system a more formal quantization procedure which takes the heisenberg commutation relations as primary , the weyl quantization otherwise referred to as the `` weyl transform''@xcite .",
    "this allows one to quantize a pdm hamiltonian but does not provide explicit operator ordering . by combining the two approaches namely the susy qm method and the weyl transform , we are able to identify specifically a couple of correct operator orderings out of infinitely many possible orderings .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in section 2 , we give a brief description of nucleation in superheated liquid helium , which makes the problem of pdm obvious . in section 3",
    ", we describe the details of using the susy qm formalism , to address the pdm problem . in section 4",
    ", we introduce weyl quantization and use it to obtain an operator form for our classical hamiltonian .",
    "this resulting weyl quantum hamiltonian is converted to a point mass representation to compare with the hamiltonian obtained through susy methods . in section 5",
    "we study the effective potential using realistic parameters , and provide a conclusion .",
    "a superheated ( or supercooled ) fluid@xcite is typically metastable since it can not make a direct , uniform transition to the stable phase throughout its volume .",
    "the transition to the stable phase occurs via the nucleation of a droplet of stable fluid , such that once the nucleus reaches a critical size it grows quickly , ultimately converting the entire liquid from metastable to stable phase .",
    "nucleation can occur due to fluctuations in pressure and volume within a liquid , whereby small quantities of a new phase ( `` bubbles '' ) form within a homogeneous phase .",
    "if the liquid were stable these bubbles would disappear ; but superheated liquid helium is metastable , so these bubbles can grow and eventually transform the system from the old liquid phase onto the new vapor phase .",
    "this growth process is driven by pressure gradients across the surface of the bubble .",
    "a recent study@xcite provided a comprehensive classical description of such a bubble nucleation process that takes into account the fluctuations in both the radius and the pressure .",
    "the helmholtz free energy corresponding to this process is : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the radius of the bubble and @xmath2 the pressure outside of the bubble .",
    "@xmath3 is the pressure inside the bubble where @xmath4 is the surface tension , @xmath5 is the internal equilibrium pressure of the bubble , and @xmath6 is the isothermal compressibility of the stable phase at the equilibrium pressure",
    ". the first term does not affect the rate of nucleation since it describes the pressure fluctuations which average out to a constant .",
    "the second and third terms of eq .",
    "( [ freeenergy ] ) provide the barrier , with respect to the radius , over which the nucleus must pass in order to expand and fill the volume with the stable phase .",
    "the critical radius for vapor nucleation is then @xmath7 . to establish the ( classical ) hamiltonian for bubble nucleation",
    ", we note that the kinetic energy of a growing nucleus is given by@xcite @xmath8 where the variable mass is given by : @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the density of the liquid and @xmath11 is the vapor density . the potential term based on eq .",
    "( [ freeenergy ] ) leads to the hamiltonian for the bubble nucleation problem @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radius of the bubble scaled to the critical radius and @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "returning to our particular case in question , we note that if we were to quantize our classical pdm hamiltonian naively by replacing @xmath16 and @xmath17 by the corresponding position and momentum operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 , an infinite set of operator forms are possible .",
    "for example , @xmath20 , @xmath21 $ ] , @xmath22 , to list just some of the simplest cases ; we show how to identify the correct specific operator ordering below .",
    "while our potential is not super - symmetric , the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) formalism permits the re - writing of the hamiltonian in terms of the familiar creation - annihilation operators by introducing an effective potential ( `` superpotential '' ) . the kinetic part of of a general pdm hamiltonian ( with @xmath23 , and without any confining potential ) can be written @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( and @xmath26 ) can take any value as long as @xmath27 .",
    "one can then write the creation - annihilation operators @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is known as superpotential and the corresponding harmonic hamiltonian is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the kinetic terms and @xmath33 are the corresponding potential terms that effectively play the role of the quadratic confining potential of a standard harmonic oscillator .",
    "the form of @xmath34 is fixed by demanding that @xmath35 obey the heisenberg algebra i.e. @xmath36 = 1 $ ] .",
    "this condition leads to @xmath37 which then implies @xmath38 we emphasize here that the procedure is independent of the form of the mass  the mass @xmath39 is completely general .",
    "the essence of the susy procedure is therefore the introduction of an extra potential @xmath40 which now contains all the effect of operator ordering via the parameter @xmath25 . for our specific pdm corresponding to the case of superheated liquid helium ,",
    "@xmath41 so that : @xmath42 and @xmath43    it is noted that when @xmath44 @xmath45 which are identical , respectively , to the equivalent superpotential and potential obtained in the classical formalism using poisson brackets in place of commutators@xcite .    to solve our problem , we need to write the hamiltonian corresponding to our situation in terms of the operators @xmath28 .",
    "writing out the `` momentum '' part of @xmath46 using our pdm @xmath47 , one can show that @xmath48 which does not depend on the parameter @xmath25 i.e independent of ordering . using this result ,",
    "one is able to write down the potentials @xmath33 and @xmath49 in terms of @xmath50 in a straightforward manner . in terms of these operators , the hamiltonian for our system",
    "is given by subtracting @xmath51 from @xmath52 and building the @xmath49 potential by remembering that @xmath16 is unitless in the original hamiltonian  this is equivalent in this case to multiplying our @xmath16 by a factor @xmath53 to get : @xmath54 + \\frac{1}{2 } .",

    "guided by the definitions of the standard qho , we therefore create an ansatz whereby we define new `` position '' and `` momentum '' variables : @xmath61 and @xmath62 . @xmath63 and @xmath64 then play the role of position and momentum operators with the usual commutation relation , @xmath65 = i$ ] .",

    "( [ heff ] ) back onto the eigenstate of the original pdm hamiltonian .",
    "once the parameter @xmath25 is determined , the unique operator ordering is decided ; we now suggest a way to select the value of this parameter .",
    "we note here that the steps involved to derive eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) is that of `` picking a particular basis '' for the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hq ] ) rather than a coordinate transformation from one position coordinate system to another position coordinate system .",
    "in particular , by choosing ansatz based on the well - known quantum harmonic oscillator , the resulting hamiltonian is assured of being of unit measure and hermitian .",
    "these requirements of unit measure and hermiticity is explained in more detail in the next section , where a coordinate transformation is directly involved .",
    "there exist in the literature several ways to formally convert classical function into operator form .",
    "weyl quantization otherwise referred to as the `` weyl transform '' is a well - known way of doing so .",

    "however , the proper procedure is quantization and then coordinate transform as we have done in this paper .",
    "this is because one loses more information than necessary otherwise  the extra information that a weyl transform gives us as a result of having pdm is lost by carrying out the coordinate transformation first . more specifically",

    "this would also be inconsistent with the susy procedure of section 3 which independently gave the term proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "finally , we note the deeper connection between the methods of section 3 and this section .",
    "the fact that the relatively simple procedure based on susy qm formalism matches the result of section 4 that involves weyl transform , coordinate transform for finding a point mass representation and re - scaling to unit measure is , indeed , a demonstration of mathematical self - consistency . at a deeper level ,",
    "the match is not surprising since the relationship between @xmath16 and @xmath63 of section 3 is indeed the same as the coordinate transform of section 4 , namely @xmath133 .",
    "however , the method of section 3 is somewhat more efficient than that of section 4 since it bypasses the need to find the point mass representation and to restore unit measure .",
    "this efficiency is possible since the quantization takes place not in the position space but in the space of raising and lowering operators ; picking a useful position representation related to well known quantum harmonic oscillator then ensures hermiticity and unit measure owing to the stone - von neumann theorem .",
