    "the properties of small metal particles in the intermediate regime between bulk  like and molecular behavior have been a subject of great interest recently . @xcite even though the electronic and optical properties of nanoparticles have been extensively studied , the effect of confinement on electron dynamics is much less understood .",
    "examples of outstanding issues include the role of electron  electron interactions in the process of cluster fragmentation , the role of surface lattice modes in providing additional channels for intra - molecular energy relaxation , the influence of the electron and nuclear motion on the superparamagnetic properties of clusters , and the effect of confinement on the nonlinear optical properties and transient response under ultrafast excitation .",
    "@xcite these and other dynamical phenomena can be studied with femtosecond nonlinear optical spectroscopy , which allows one to probe the time evolution of the excited states with a resolution shorter than the energy relaxation or dephasing times .",
    "surface collective excitations play an important role in the absorption of light by metal nanoparticles . in large particles with sizes comparable to the wave  length of light @xmath1 ( but smaller than the bulk mean free path ) ,",
    "the lineshape of the surface plasmon ( sp ) resonance is determined by the electromagnetic effects.@xcite in small nanoparticles with radii @xmath2 , the absorption spectrum is governed by quantum confinement effects .",
    "for example , the momentum non  conservation due to the confining potential leads to the landau damping of the sp and to a resonance linewidth inversely proportional to the nanoparticle size.@xcite confinement changes also non  linear optical properties of nanoparticles : a size  dependent enhancement of the third order susceptibilities , caused by the elastic surface scattering of single  particle excitations , has been reported.@xcite    extensive experimental studies of the electron relaxation in nanoparticles have recently been performed using ultrafast pump ",
    "probe spectroscopy.@xcite unlike in semiconductors , the dephasing processes in metals are very fast , and nonequilibrium populations of optically excited electrons and holes are formed within several femtoseconds . these thermalize into the hot fermi  dirac distribution within several hundreds of femtoseconds , mainly due to _ e  e _ and _ h  h _ scattering .",
    "@xcite since the electron heat capacity is much smaller than that of the lattice , a high electron temperature can be reached during less than 1 ps time scales , i.e. , before any significant energy transfer to the phonon bath occurs . during this stage ,",
    "the sp resonance was observed to undergo a time ",
    "dependent spectral broadening.@xcite subsequently , the electron and phonon baths equilibrate through the electron ",
    "phonon interactions over time intervals of a few picoseconds . during this incoherent stage",
    ", the hot electron distribution can be characterized by a time ",
    "dependent temperature .",
    "correlation effects play an important role in the latter regime .",
    "for example , in order to explain the differential absorption lineshape , it is essential to take into account the _ e  e _ scattering of the optically  excited carriers near the fermi surface.@xcite furthermore , despite the similarities to the bulk  like behavior , observed , e.g. , in metal films , certain aspects of the optical dynamics in nanoparticles are significantly different.@xcite for example , experimental studies of small cu nanoparticles revealed that the relaxation times of the the pump  probe signal depend strongly on frequency : the relaxation was considerably slower at the sp resonance.@xcite this and other observations suggest that collective surface excitations play an important role in the electron dynamics in small metal particles .",

    "1(b )  and  ( c ) we show the differential transmission spectra with decreasing nanoparticle size . for @xmath241 nm ,",
    "the apparent red  shift is reduced [ see fig .",
    "this change can be explained as follows . since here @xmath242 , the sp is damped by the interband excitations for @xmath243 , so that the absorption peak is _ asymmetric_. the @xmath0hole scattering with the sp enhances the damping ; however , since the @xmath94dependence of @xmath216 follows that of @xmath191 , this effect is larger above the resonance . on the other hand , the efficiency of scattering increases with temperature , as discussed above .",
    "therefore , for short time delays , the increase in the absorption is relatively larger for @xmath243 . with decreasing size",
    ", the strength of this effect increases , leading to an apparent blue  shift [ see fig .",
    "such a strong change in the absorption dynamics originates from the @xmath179 dependence of the @xmath0hole scattering rate ; reducing the size by the factor of two results in an enhancement of @xmath216 by an order of magnitude .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the time evolution of the differential transmission at several frequencies close to @xmath194 . it can be seen that the relaxation is slowest at the sp resonance ; this characterizes the robustness of the collective mode , which determines the peak position , versus the single  particle excitations , which determine the resonance width . for larger sizes ,",
    "at which @xmath216 is small , the change in the differential transmission decay rate with _ frequency _ is smoother above the resonance [ see fig .",
    "this stems from the asymmetric lineshape of the absorption peak , mentioned above : the absorption is larger for @xmath243 , so that its _ relative _ change with temperature is weaker . for smaller nanoparticle size ,",
    "the decay rates become similar above and below @xmath194 [ see fig .",
    "this change in the frequency dependence is related to the stronger sp damping for @xmath243 due to the @xmath0hole scattering , as discussed above .",
    "since this additional damping is reduced with decreasing temperature , the relaxation is faster above the resonance , compensating the relatively weaker change in the absorption .",
    "this rather `` nonlinear '' relation between the time ",
    "evolution of the pump  probe signal and that of the temperature , becomes even stronger for smaller sizes [ see fig .",

    ", the frequency dependence of the differential transmission decay below and above @xmath194 is reversed .",
    "note , that a frequency dependence consistent with our calculations presented in fig .",
    "2(b ) was , in fact , observed in the experiment of ref .. at the same time , the changes in the linear absorption spectrum are relatively small .",
    "to summarize , we have examined theoretically the role of size  dependent correlations in the electron relaxation in small metal particles .",
    "we identified a new mechanism of quasiparticle scattering , mediated by collective surface excitations , which originates from the surface  induced dynamical screening of the _ e  e _ interactions .",
    "the behavior of the corresponding scattering rates with varying energy and temperature differs substantially from that in the bulk metal .",
    "in particular , in noble metal particles , the energy dependence of the @xmath0hole scattering rate was found similar to that of the absorption coefficient .",
    "this led us to a self  consistent scheme for the calculation of the absorption spectrum near the surface plasmon resonance .",
    "an important aspect of the sp  mediated scattering is its strong dependence on size .",
    "our estimates show that it becomes comparable to the usual fermi  liquid scattering in nanometer  sized particles .",
    "this size regime is , in fact , intermediate between `` classical '' particles with sizes larger than 10 nm , where the bulk  like behavior dominates , and very small clusters with only dozens of atoms , where the metallic properties are completely lost .",
    "although the static properties of nanometer  sized particles are also size  dependent , the deviations from their bulk values do not change the qualitative features of the electron _",
    "dynamics_. in contrast , the size ",
    "dependent _ many  body _ effects , studied here , _ do _ affect the dynamics in a significant way during time scales comparable to the relaxation times .",
    "as we have shown , the sp  mediated interband scattering reveals itself in the transient pump  probe spectra .",
    "in particular , as the nanoparticle size decreases , the calculated time  resolved differential absorption develops a characteristic lineshape corresponding to a resonance blue  shift . at the same time , near the sp resonance , the scattering leads to a significant change in the frequency dependence of the relaxation time of the pump  probe signal , consistent with recent experiments .",
    "these results indicate the need for a systematic experimental studies of the size  dependence of the transient nonlinear optical response , as we approach the transition from boundary  constrained nanoparticles to molecular clusters .                                                    in semiconductor quantum dots , where the discrete energy levels are well resolved",
