    "run-1 at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) was a great success , culminating in the discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "no physics beyond the standard model was discovered in this run , however run-2 , with a larger center - of - mass energy and integrated luminosity , will allow for an increased discovery potential for new physics .",
    "precision measurements of the higgs boson and of various electroweak observables will be performed with extraordinary accuracy in new kinematic regimes in run 2 .",
    "run-1 achievements , such as the combined atlas / cms measurement of the higgs boson mass with 0.2% accuracy @xcite , will soon be superseded .",
    "for both precision measurements and for discovery of possible new physics , it is important to have the proper tools for the calculation of the relevant cross sections .",
    "these tools include both matrix element determinations at higher orders in perturbative qcd and electroweak theory , and precision parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the need for precision pdfs was driven home by the recent calculation of the inclusive cross section for gluon - gluon fusion to a higgs boson at nnnlo  @xcite . as this tour - de - force calculation",
    "has significantly reduced the scale dependence of the higgs cross section , the pdf and @xmath0 uncertainties become the dominant remaining theoretical uncertainty ( as of the last pdf4lhc recommendation ) .    the ct10 parton distribution functions were published at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in 2010  @xcite , followed by the ct10 next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) parton distribution functions in 2013  @xcite .",
    "these pdf ensembles were determined using diverse experimental data from fixed - target experiments , hera and the tevatron collider , but without data from the lhc . in this paper",
    ", we present a next generation of pdfs , designated as ct14 .",
    "the ct14 pdfs include data from the lhc for the first time , as well as updated data from the tevatron and from hera experiments .",
    "various ct14 pdf sets have been produced at the leading order ( lo ) , nlo and nnlo and are available from lhapdf  @xcite .",
    "the cteq - tea philosophy has always been to determine pdfs from data on inclusive , high - momentum transfer processes , for which perturbative qcd is expected to be reliable .",
    "for example , in the case of deep inelastic lepton scattering , we only use data with @xmath1 gev and @xmath2 gev .",
    "data in this region are expected to be relatively free of non - perturbative effects , such as higher twists or nuclear corrections .",
    "thus , there is no need to introduce phenomenological models for nonperturbative corrections beyond the leading - twist perturbative contributions .    for the majority of processes in the ct14 global analysis , theoretical predictions",
    "are now included at the nnlo level of accuracy . in particular , a nnlo treatment @xcite of heavy - quark mass effects in neutral - current dis is realized in the acot-@xmath3 scheme  @xcite and is essential for obtaining correct predictions for lhc electroweak cross sections  @xcite .",
    "we make two exceptions to this rule , by including measurements for charged - current dis and inclusive jet production at nlo only . in both cases ,",
    "the complete nnlo contributions are not yet available , but it can be argued based on our studies that the expected effect of missing nnlo effects is small relatively to current experimental errors ( cf .",
    "[ sec : setup ] ) . for both types of processes ,",
    "the nlo predictions have undergone various benchmarking tests . a numerical error was discovered and corrected in the implementation of the sacot-@xmath3 scheme for charged - current dis , resulting in relatively small changes from ct10 ( within the pdf uncertainties ) .    as in the ct10 global analysis",
    ", we use a charm pole mass of 1.3 gev , which was shown to be consistent with the ct10 data in ref .",
    "the pdfs for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( anti-)quarks and the gluon are parametrized at an initial scale of 1.295 gev , and the charm quark pdf is turned on with zero intrinsic charm as the scale @xmath7 reaches the charm pole mass .",
    "the new lhc measurements of @xmath8 cross sections directly probe the flavor separation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( anti-)quarks in an @xmath9-range around @xmath10 that was not directly assessed by the previously available experiments .",
    "we also include an updated measurement of electron charge asymmetry from the d   collaboration  @xcite , which probes the @xmath5 quark pdf at @xmath11 .",
    "to better estimate variations in relevant pdf combinations , such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we increased the number of free pdf parameters to 28 , compared to 25 in ct10 nnlo . as another important modification , ct14 employs a novel flexible parametrization for the pdfs , based on the use of bernstein polynomials ( reviewed in the appendix ) .",
    "the shape of the bernstein polynomials is such that a single polynomial is dominant in each given @xmath9 range , reducing undesirable correlations among the pdf parameters that sometimes occurred in ct10 . in the asymptotic limits of @xmath14 or @xmath15 , the new parametrization forms allow for the possibility of arbitrary constant ratios of @xmath16 or @xmath17 , in contrast to the more constrained behavior assumed in ct10 .",
    "the pdf error sets of the ct14 ensemble are obtained using two techniques , the hessian method @xcite and monte - carlo sampling @xcite .",
    "lagrange multiplier studies  @xcite have also been used to verify the hessian uncertainties , especially in regions not well constrained by data .",
    "this applies at nnlo and nlo ; no error sets are provided at lo due to the difficulty in defining meaningful uncertainties at that order .",
    "a central value of @xmath18 of 0.118 has been assumed in the global fits at nlo and nnlo , but pdf sets at alternative values of @xmath19 are also provided .",
    "ct14 prefers @xmath20 at nnlo ( @xmath21 at nlo ) at 90 % confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "these uncertainties from the global qcd fits are larger than those of the data from lep and other experiments included into the world average  @xcite .",
    "thus , the central pdf sets are obtained using the value of @xmath22 , which is consistent with the world average value and was recommended by the pdf4lhc group  @xcite . for the ct14 lo pdfs",
    ", we follow the precedent begun in cteq6 @xcite by supplying two versions , one with a 1-loop @xmath18 value of 0.130 , and the other with a 2-loop @xmath18 value of 0.118 .",
    "the flavor composition of ct14 pdfs has changed somewhat compared to ct10 due to the inclusion of new lhc and tevatron data sets , to the use of modified parametrization forms , and to the numerical modifications discussed above .",
    "the new pdfs are largely compatible with ct10 within the estimated pdf uncertainty .",
    "the ct14 nnlo pdfs have a softer strange quark distribution at low @xmath9 and a somewhat softer gluon at high @xmath9 , compared to ct10 nnlo .",
    "the @xmath16 ratio has decreased at high @xmath9 in comparison to ct10 , as a consequence of replacing the 2008 d   electron charge asymmetry ( @xmath23 @xcite ) measurement by the new @xmath24 data set @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 ratio approaches a constant value in the @xmath15 limit due to the input physics assumption that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 behave as @xmath27 at @xmath28 with the same value of @xmath29 ( reflecting expectations from spectator counting rules ) , but allowing for independent normalizations .",
    "the @xmath30 ratio has also changed as a consequence of the new data and the new parametrization form .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the goal of the ct14 global analysis is to provide a new generation of pdfs intended for widespread use in high - energy experiments .",
    "as we generate new pdf sets , we include newly available experimental data sets and theoretical calculations , and redesign the functional forms of pdfs if new data or new theoretical calculations favor it . all changes  data , theory , and parametrization  contribute to the differences between the old and new generations of pdfs in ways that are correlated and frequently can not be separated .",
    "the most important , but not the only , criterion for the selection of pdfs is the minimization of the log - likelihood @xmath34 that quantifies agreement of theory and data . in addition , we make some `` prior assumptions '' about the forms of the pdfs . a pdf set that violates them may be rejected even if it lowers @xmath34 .",
    "for example , we assume that the pdfs are smoothly varying functions of @xmath9 , without abrupt variations or short - wavelength oscillations .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental data and sufficient for making new predictions .",
    "no pdf can be negative at the input scale @xmath35 , to preclude negative cross sections in the predictions .",
    "flavor - dependent ratios or cross section asymmetries must also take physical values , which limits the range of allowed parametrizations in extreme kinematical regions with poor experimental constraints .",
    "for example , in the ct14 parametrization we restricted the functional forms of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 pdfs so that @xmath36 would remain finite and nonzero at @xmath15 , cf . the appendix .",

    "however , this parametrization has two undesirable features .",
    "first , because the exponential function can vary rapidly , the power laws @xmath69 and @xmath27 , which formally control the @xmath70 and @xmath71 limits , need not actually dominate in practical regions of small @xmath9 ( say @xmath78 ) or large @xmath9 ( say @xmath79 ) .",
    "second , the qualitative similarity of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 to each other causes the parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 to be strongly correlated with each other in the fit . this correlation may destabilize the @xmath37 minimization and compromise the hessian approach to uncertainty analysis , since that approach is based on a quadratic dependence of @xmath37 on the fitting parameters , which is only guaranteed close to the minimum .",
    "we introduce a better style of parametrization in ct14 .",
    "we begin by replacing @xmath72 by a polynomial in @xmath77 , which avoids the rapid variations invited by an exponential form .",
    "low - order polynomials have been used previously by many other groups ; however , polynomials with higher powers were less widespread .",
    "we add them now to provide more flexibility in the parametrization .",
    "in particular , for the best - constrained flavor combination @xmath86 we use a fourth - order polynomial @xmath87 where @xmath88 . but rather than using the coefficients @xmath89 directly as fitting parameters , we re - express the polynomial as a linear combination of _ bernstein polynomials _ : @xmath90 where @xmath91 this re - expression does not change the functional form of @xmath92 : it is still a completely general fourth - order polynomial in @xmath93 .",

    "this is the same number of parameters as were used in ct10 nnlo . as a consistency check",
    ", we find that allowing the @xmath102 and @xmath29 parameters for @xmath110 to be independent of those for @xmath111 would reduce @xmath112 by less than one unit .",

    "the additional fractional uncertainty at small @xmath9 generated by allowing different @xmath102 powers is also not important , because that uncertainty only appears in the valence quantities @xmath113 and @xmath114 ; while most processes of interest are governed by the much larger @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 themselves .",

    "a large portion of the data included in the global fit are from electron and muon dis on protons , which is more sensitive to @xmath4 and @xmath104 than to @xmath119 and @xmath120 because of the squares of their electric charges .",
    "hence , when similar parametrizations are used for @xmath92 and @xmath121 , the uncertainties of @xmath122 and @xmath123 are relatively large .    our assumption @xmath124 forces @xmath125 to approach a constant in the limit @xmath71 .",
    "it allows our phenomenological findings to be relevant for the extensive discussions of what that constant might be @xcite .",

    "hence both @xmath128 and @xmath129 at @xmath130 remain fully consistent with the data .",
    "however , our assumption @xmath124 does not restrict the calculated uncertainty range materially in regions where it is not already very large .    by way of comparison ,",
    "if we use the ct10 nnlo @xcite form ( [ eq : ct10valence ] ) for @xmath111 and @xmath110 , we obtain a slightly better fit ( @xmath37 lower by 8) with an unreasonable @xmath131 . similar behavior led us to fix @xmath132 in ct10 nnlo .    in a different comparison , the mstw2008 fit @xcite uses a parametrization for @xmath111 and @xmath110 that is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : appendixpoly ] ) with @xmath133 , with the power - law parameters @xmath102 and @xmath29 allowed to differ between @xmath111 and @xmath110 .",

    "the more recent mmht2014 @xcite pdf fit uses full fourth - order polynomials for @xmath111 and @xmath110 . in our fit , however , we find that no significant improvement in @xmath37 would result from treating @xmath137 and @xmath138 as free parameters , rather than choosing them to cancel the first subleading behavior at @xmath71 , as we have done .",
    "meanwhile the hera pdf fits @xcite use much more restricted forms , equivalent to @xmath139 for @xmath140 and @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "those forms are far too simple to describe our data set : using them in place of our choice increases @xmath37 by more than 200 .",
    "we made a case in previous work @xcite to repackage polynomial parametrizations like ( [ eq : appendixpoly ] ) as linear combinations of chebyshev polynomials of argument @xmath143 .",
    "this method has been adopted in the recent mmht2014 fit @xcite .",
    "however , we now contend that repackaging based on a linear combination of bernstein polynomials , as we do in ct14 , is much better .",
    "the full functional forms available in the fit are , of course , the same either way .",
    "but , because each of the bernstein polynomials has a single peak , and the peaks occur at different values of @xmath9 , the coefficients that multiply those polynomials mainly control distinct physical regions , and are therefore somewhat independent of each other .",
    "in contrast , every chebyshev polynomial of argument @xmath144 has a maximum value @xmath145 at both @xmath146 and @xmath147 , along with an equal maximum magnitude at some interior points .",
    "all chebyshev polynomials are important over the entire range of @xmath9 , so their coefficients are strongly correlated in the fit .",
    "this causes minor difficulties in finding the best fit and major difficulties in using the hessian method to estimate uncertainties based on orthogonal eigenvectors .",
    "furthermore , using bernstein polynomials makes it easy to enforce the desired positivity of the pdfs in the @xmath70 and @xmath71 limits , because each of those limits is controlled by a single polynomial .",
    "we use a similar parametrization for the gluon , but with a polynomial of a lower order , because the data provide fewer constraints on the gluon distribution : @xmath148\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath149 however , in place of @xmath150 , we use the mapping @xmath151 this mapping makes @xmath152 and hence @xmath153 in the limit @xmath130 .",
    "this is an alternative way to suppress the first subleading power of @xmath99 at @xmath71 .",
    "we have 5 free parameters to describe the gluon distribution , including @xmath154 which governs the fraction of momentum carried by the gluons .",
    "the best fit has @xmath155 , with the range @xmath156 allowed by an increase of only 5 in @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast , ct10 nnlo @xcite again used the form ( [ eq : ct10valence ] ) for the gluon distribution , where @xmath29 was frozen at an arbitrary value of 10 because @xmath37 was rather insensitive to it .",
    "that left the same number of free parameters as are used here , but did nt allow anything to be learned about the behavior at very large @xmath9 .",
    "if we use ( [ eq : ct10valence ] ) for the gluon in our present fit , the resulting @xmath37 is nearly as good , but again this choice yields almost no information about the sixth parameter @xmath29 : a range of @xmath157 includes @xmath158 .",
    "the negative @xmath29 part of that range corresponds to an integrably singular gluon probability density at @xmath71 , which is not actually forbidden theoretically ; but would be totally unexpected .",
    "this older parametrization would bring in unmotivated complexity in the large - x region that is not indicated by any present data . to test that our parametrization has adequate flexibility",
    ", we made similar fits using somewhat higher order bernstein polynomials , including up to a total of 10 more free parameters .",
    "we calculated the uncertainty for the @xmath159 cross section at 8 tev using the lagrange multiplier method , and found very little variation in the range of the prediction .",
    "we also calculated the range of uncertainty in @xmath19 obtained from our fits at 90% confidence ( including our tier 2 penalty ) .",
    "the extra freedom in parametrization increased the uncertainty range only slightly : @xmath160 using the ct14 parametrization ; @xmath161 using the more flexible one .",
    "the sea quark distributions @xmath105 and @xmath104 were parametrized using fourth - order polynomials in @xmath53 with the same mapping @xmath162 that was used for the gluon .",
    "we assumed @xmath163 at @xmath70 , which implies @xmath164 .",
    "as the strangeness content is constrained rather poorly , we used a minimal parametrization @xmath165 , with @xmath102 tied to the common @xmath102 of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "even fewer experimental constraints apply to the strangeness asymmetry , so we have assumed @xmath166 in this analysis .",
    "thus , we have just two parameters for strangeness in our hessian method : @xmath29 and normalization . in view of more upcoming data on measuring the asymmetry in the production cross sections of @xmath167 and @xmath33 from the lhc",
    ", we plan to include @xmath168 in our next round of fits .",
    "in all , we have 8 parameters associated with the valence quarks , 5 parameters associated with the gluon , and 13 parameters associated with sea quarks , for a total of 26 fitting parameters .",
    "hence there are 52 eigenvector sets generated by the hessian method that captures most of the pdf uncertainty .",
    "the hessian method tends to underestimate the uncertainty for pdf variations that are poorly constrained , because the method is based on the assumption that @xmath37 is a quadratic function of the fitting parameters ; and that assumption tends to break down when the parameters can move a long way because of a lack of experimental constraints .",
    "this can be seen , for example , for the case of the small-@xmath9 gluon uncertainty , by a lagrange multiplier scan in which a series of fits are made with different values of the independent variable @xmath169 at @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "in order to include the wide variation of the gluon distribution that is allowed at small @xmath9 , we therefore supplement the hessian sets with an additional pair of sets that were obtained using the lagrange multiplier method : one with enhanced gluon and one with suppressed gluon at small @xmath9 , as was already done in ct10 . in ct14 , we also include an additional pair of sets with enhanced or suppressed strangeness at small @xmath9 ; although it is possible that treating @xmath172 as a fitting parameter independent from @xmath164 would have worked equally well .    in summary , we have a total of 56 error sets : @xmath173 from the hessian method , supplemented by two extremes of small-@xmath9 gluon , and two extremes of small-@xmath9 strangeness .",
    "uncertainties from all pairs of error sets are to be summed in quadrature using the master formulas  @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "ct10 nnlo had 50 error sets .",
    "the increased flexibility in the ct14 parametrization is warranted by better experimental constraints and its improved fit to the data .",
    "indeed , fitting the ct14 data set using the old ct10 parametrizations yields a best fit that is worse by 60 units in @xmath37 .            c.  anastasiou , c.  duhr , f.  dulat , f.  herzog and b.  mistlberger , arxiv:1503.06056 [ hep - ph ] .",
