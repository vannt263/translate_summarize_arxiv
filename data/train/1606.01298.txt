    "couplings to @xmath0 , @xmath1 as well as effective one - loop couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 are also well described by the sm @xcite .",
    "however , present day uncertainties still allow for a variety of new physics possibilities .",
    "for example , when compared with two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) , these measurements constrain the parameter space but do not exclude the possibility of additional scalars below 1 tev @xcite .",
    "two higgs doublet models can also be confronted with @xmath2 and @xmath3 fits and this comparison restricts the allowed parameter space .",
    "manohar and wise ( mw ) @xcite introduced a model consisting of the sm augmented by a colour octet electroweak doublet of scalars .",
    "the addition was motivated by minimal flavour violation : assuming that the scalars transform trivially under the flavour group , only electroweak doublets which are colour singlets or octets are allowed .",
    "these coloured scalars are very weakly constrained by direct searches at lhc but they can affect the loop induced higgs couplings by factors of two . the model has been constrained theoretically and also using the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fits with comparable results , and there are many phenomenological studies in the literature @xcite .",
    "in this paper we combine these two extensions of the sm and consider a two higgs doublet model with an additional scalar octet as in mw .",
    "the motivation for studying this model is that this is a simple extension of the sm that can satisfy minimal flavour violation .",
    "more complicated models exist that contain both of these ingredients @xcite , but our approach here is purely phenomenological .",
    "our main goal is to explore the one - loop effective couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the sm - like higgs in two higgs doublet models in the presence of the additional scalar @xmath4 transforming as @xmath5 under the sm gauge group @xmath6 .",
    "the model contains a large number of parameters that we first reduce by imposing standard theoretical constraints such as minimal flavour violation @xcite , custodial symmetry @xcite , and perturbative unitarity @xcite .",
    "the question of vacuum stability @xcite is more complicated and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the model we discuss in this paper is an extension of the type i and type ii two higgs doublet models . in this extension",
    "we add a colour octet electroweak doublet of scalars as in the mw @xcite extension of the sm .",
    "the scalar content is chosen to satisfy desirable properties : minimal flavour violation which naturally suppresses flavour changing neutral currents and custodial symmetry which naturally preserves the relation @xmath7 . as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the only possible extensions of the scalar sector that do not transform under the flavour group and that satisfy minimal flavour violation are electroweak doublets that are colour singlets or colour octets and this motivates our choice for this model .",

    "the first one would use the results of the 2hdm ignoring the additional contributions from the colour octet .",
    "these points are shown in blue in figure  [ f : hloop2 ] . the second point ( in red )",
    "is the one corresponding to the calculation in the full model , already shown in figure  [ f : hloop ] .",
    "points in parameter space that satisfy the unitarity constraints of the extended 2hdm are shown in a @xmath2-@xmath190 plot .",

    "the blue points correspond to the @xmath200 rates being calculated without the contributions from the colour octet.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the region allowed by both tree - level unitarity and higgs decays at one - loop can be used to predict the loop - induced decays of the heavier neutral scalars . as an example",

    "we have constructed an extension of 2hdm in which a colour - octet electroweak - doublet ( mw ) is added .",
    "starting from the most general renormalizable scalar potential we have reduced the number of allowed terms with the usual theoretical requirements of minimal flavour violation and custodial symmetry .",
    "we have scanned the remaining parameter space to find the region which satisfies perturbative unitarity and have presented two dimensional projections of this region .",
    "the high energy two - to - two scattering matrix elements imply that correlations exist between certain pairs of the new couplings which are observed in these projections .",
    "we have then confronted the model with available lhc results in the form of fitted couplings of the higgs boson which we identify with the lightest scalar in the 2hdm . after collecting constraints on the parameters of the 2hdm from tree - level higgs couplings we constrain the new sector couplings to the colour - octet using a current fit on the one loop @xmath3 and @xmath2 couplings .",
    "addition of the colour - octet affects most the one loop @xmath3 and @xmath2 modes where it enlarges the allowed region of parameter space in the @xmath186 plane , but not notably in the overlap zone with tree - level unitarity constraints as seen in figure  [ f : unit ] . of course",
    ", introducing a new colour - octet scalar does nt populate more points in the unitarity allowed region when projected to the 2hdm parameter space .",
    "the colour - octet also enlarges the region of overlap with the @xmath167 bounds @xmath3 and @xmath2 , but the branching ratio of @xmath205 tends to increase more significantly than that of @xmath190 as can be seen in figure  [ f : hloop ] .",
    "this research was supported in part by the doe under contract number de - sc0009974 .",
