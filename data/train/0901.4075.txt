    "in everyday experience , even when we do not realize it , we use our intuition to draw inferences . for example",
    "when we hear doorbell we immediately ask ourselves `` who has come ? '' . on the way to the door we consider many different possibilities .",
    "maybe it is our friend , who said some days before that he visit us .",
    "maybe it is our neighbor , who came to say that we should lower the music or maybe somebody came to inform us that we have won in the lottery and so on and so on .",
    "all of these possibilities are more or less probable , with some outcomes which we can not figure out _",
    "ex ante_. but every bit of information influences our expectations and we stick on outcome which seems to be most probable ( subjectively ) to us .",
    "so we look through the window and see a car on the street , that looks like our friend s , we are almost sure that it is he in fact . or if we really play music very loudly we can expect that sooner or later somebody will be angry . when we do not expect somebody we know",
    ", we assume that it may be the postman or someone who got the wrong address .",
    "in fact we always choose the simplest case .",
    "it means that we never assume that superman is standing behind the door , even when there is a reason why he should visit us .",
    "this intuitive feeling to choose the simplest solution is called occam s razor @xcite and it states formally    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` accept the simplest explanation that fits the data '' . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in our example the data means in fact what we already know .",
    "this example is very easy and our faculties manage very well to solve problems of this kind .",
    "however there is a vast variety of problems for which there are uncountable possibilities and such problems can be treated only in an approximated manner . on the other hand",
    "there are problems , which are too tedious to be solved by humans in reasonable time and we should employ to do job .",
    "so , can we enclose this intuitive knowledge in the form of mathematically defined theory and use it instead of mind ?",
    "the answer is yes , this exciting idea is embodied in the form of bayesian inference @xcite .",
    "below we introduce bayesian inference and show how it works in practice .",
    "we start from general considerations which lead us to the connection with thermodynamics .",
    "subsequently we show how to write down problems on computer with use of the monte - carlo approach ( the metropolis algorithm ) .",
    "we describe possible applications in the modern cosmology .",
    "there is a huge number of places in cosmology where bayesian inference can often be applied .",
    "we have residual observations and a lot of theories .",
    "some of them are easy , some are pure models , some are brilliant new ideas .",
    "this is as with our example with the door bell .",
    "we hear the bell and we must predict who is at the door . without any information we can not predict who is ringing , because the sound of the bell is always the same",
    ". however some people ring only once and some of them more times .",
    "therefore we must listen very carefully when something is ringing in cosmology .",
    "in the last section we try to put bayesian inference into a larger perspective : containing epistemological aspects of the method as well as suggested limitations .",
    "our goal it to present a  way to choose among alternative theories taking into account their conformity with data .",
    "of course these theories can have different basis .",
    "they can be connected with everyday experience , data analysis , biology , physics etc .",
    "because we want to apply finally bayesian inference in physics we can restrict ourselves now , without loss of generality , to physical theories .",
    "so let us consider some unknown physical phenomenon and let us say we possess @xmath0 theories @xmath1 that can potentially describe it .",
    "all these theories differ from one another .",
    "information about phenomenon investigated is contained in the collection of experimental data @xmath2 . both theories and experimental data we may consider as elements of the same set space @xmath3 so @xmath4 .",
    "the set @xmath3 together with measure @xmath5 and @xmath6-algebra @xmath7 build probability space @xmath8 .",
    "in such a well defined theory of probability , a natural concept of conditional probability occurs .",
    "so the probability of a given theory @xmath9 , when we have data @xmath2 , is defined as @xmath10 this probability tells us which theory describes experimental data @xmath2 better and is called posterior probability . on the other hand we can ask about probability of outcomes @xmath2 when theory @xmath9 is the true one @xmath11 this probability tells us about different predictions @xmath2 from the theory @xmath9 and is a marginal likelihood ,",
    "commonly called evidence . because @xmath12 we can combine equations ( [ posterior ] ) and ( [ evidence ] ) what give us @xmath13 this equation is the famous bayes theorem . the probability @xmath14 in this equation is called prior probability and it is in fact hard to describe this number .",
    "it describes our initial beliefs about a given theory .",
    "it is a human factor to choose this number and can be non - objective .",
    "sometimes one theory is chosen because of its mathematical beauty although a  more probable alternative exists .",
    "the other factor is that some theory can well describe variety of others similar phenomena .",
    "however , if we do not have strong motivation to introduce some initial selection of the theories , then the most natural choice is to assume a homogeneous distribution of the prior probability @xmath15 then none of theories is favored .",
    "the probability @xmath16 is a  simple normalization constant , what we can calculate thanks to the normalization condition @xmath17 which together with the bayes theorem  ( [ bayes ] ) give us @xmath18    each of the theories @xmath1 contains a number of parameters described by the vector @xmath19 for a particular theory .",
    "the simple theories ( simple mathematically ) contain in general a small number of parameters .",
    "the main increase of number of parameters enlarges the complexity of theories .",
    "this complexity can be in some cases accepted due to intrinsic beauty of a  mathematical structure of theory .",
    "nevertheless the theory which has one factor to explain a  phenomenon is preferable over the theory which employ many factors for description of it .",
    "effective theories belong to the type of simple theories .",
    "@xmath20    parameters @xmath21 of the model @xmath22 are elements of the set space @xmath3 .",
    "the values of these parameters may be fixed or significantly bounded by a  theory .",
    "but when no limits are put on these parameters ( there is no prior knowledge ) the evidence is calculated as the marginal probability integrated over all the allowed range of values of the parameters of the model .",
    "now we can go back to the bayes theorem and explain the idea of bayesian inference . considering the bayes theorems for two models @xmath23 and @xmath24 and dividing the respective equations ( [ bayes ] ) by sides we obtain @xmath25 which is called the bayes factor .",
    "if the priors @xmath14 for all @xmath23 are equal then the bayes factor reduces to the ratio of evidences ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath27 can be interpreted as follows : if @xmath28 then inference is inconclusive , if @xmath29 we have weak , if @xmath30 we have moderate and if @xmath31 we have strong evidence in favor of a model indexed by @xmath23 over the model indexed by @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "so the main problem is now to calculate the evidence .",
    "the direct calculation is generally impossible .",
    "that is the reason is to use the monte carlo methods to do it .",
    "first we introduce the parameter @xmath32 and redefine evidence to the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 the @xmath35 is in fact likelihood and we denote it by @xmath36 .",
    "so @xmath37 and @xmath38    = \\exp \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\lambda   \\langle \\log l",
    "\\rangle_{\\lambda}.    \\label{eq12}\\ ] ]    now we can show a  connection between our approach and thermodynamics . introducing @xmath39",
    "we obtain @xmath40 and equation ( [ eq11 ] ) takes a known form @xmath41 this is the energy of the system in the temperature @xmath42 . when we calculate it for different temperatures we can directly evaluate the integral in the expression ( [ eq12 ] ) and hence the evidence . as we see , to perform the bayesian inference we have to calculate the thermodynamical integral  ( [ int ] ) .",
    "this kind of integrals can be solved analytically only in case of very simple systems .",
    "numerical methods to solve this kind of problems are known as the monte carlo .",
    "it is not the subject of this paper to describe how they work in detail .",
    "however to make this paper self - contained we add a short appendix a introducing basics of the monte carlo methods .",
    "we also present experimental demonstration of property of ergodicity which is important in the context of monte carlo simulation ( see appendix b ) .",
    "an interested reader can find more on monte carlo simulations e.g. in @xcite .",
    "now we have all theoretical equipment to show this approach in action . in this example",
    "we show how to perform the bayesian inference in a very simple case .",
    "we consider a very simple kind of theories and a small sample of data - points to make computer computation short .",
    "we also design it for clarity and better understanding .",
    "however generalizations to more advanced problems are straightforward . in the next section",
    "we will mention how to apply bayesian methods to more complicated problems .",
    "let us consider some experiment in which we perform measurements of some physical variable @xmath43 for six different values of parameter @xmath44 . in the experiment we also measure standard error of the outcomes @xmath43 .",
    "in fact we one can repeat many times measurements of @xmath43 for a given @xmath44 value .",
    "then one can obtain the mean values of parameter @xmath43 together with its dispersion .",
    "these data points we present in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    ".in the table we collect the exemplary pairs @xmath45 together with the uncertainty of @xmath43 .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath46 can be the result of the instrumental resolution . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the phenomenon which we instigate is still not undetermined , but we possess three polynomial models to describe them .",
    "we list these models below @xmath47 models 1 and 3 look more simple because each is described by two parameters when model 2 contains three unknown parameters .",
    "the first step of bayesian inference is to fit these models to experimental data .",
    "we can use for example method of least squares .",
    "we obtain @xmath48    the important ingredient in the bayesian inference is a choice of priors .",
    "it is the choice of the intervals and probability distribution for parameters .",
    "the parameter intervals should be specified , because we must perform the integration ( look for the solution ) in a finite parameter space .",
    "standard errors of the parameters give us intervals necessary for bayesian inference .",
    "of course , the different choices of the parameter intervals can lead to the different values of the posterior probabilities .   in our case , we choose the intervals as the @xmath49-@xmath6 confidence interval for the parameters .",
    "namely , @xmath50 $ ] , where @xmath51 is the best fit value and @xmath6 is the standard error .",
    "next we assume that outcomes are from the gaussian distribution and the likelihood function has then a form @xmath52.\\ ] ]    now we apply theory described in the previous section . with use of the metropolis algorithm",
    "we calculate energies @xmath53 for models considered .",
    "we perform calculations for the values of @xmath32 from the range @xmath54 as it is necessary to calculate the integral in equation  ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "we show these results in fig .  [ 1 ] ,  [ 2 ] ,  [ 3 ] .",
    "dependence for the first model.,width=264 ]     dependence for the second model.,width=264 ]     dependence for the third model.,width=264 ]    now with use of this data we can perform integrals in the form @xmath55 from equation  ( [ eq12 ] ) we see that @xmath56 obtained values for three models considered are @xmath57 now we can directly calculate bayes factors @xmath58 based on the obtained values of @xmath59 one can conclude :    * because @xmath60 , we have weak evidence that the linear model is favored over the three parametric quadratic model . * because @xmath61 , the two parametric quadratic model is moderately preferred over the the three parametric quadratic model . * because @xmath62 , there is no preferences between the two parametric models , linear and quadratic .",
    "we can also directly calculate posterior probabilities @xmath63",
    "what we see is that the posterior probability suggest that the last model explains the experimental data in the best way . even that it may look more complicated than linear model number one .",
    "the second model can be discarded .",
    "this model contains remaining models inside and naturally fits better to the experimental data because has more degrees of freedom . but comparing to the other models he is too complicated and not necessarily properly explains experimental data .",
    "we see that however first and last model possess the same number of degrees of freedom the last function seems to explain in the better way the nature of the investigated physical process . on the other hand , from the bayes factor criterion",
    ", one can not seen such a preference .",
    "it is because the borders in the bayes factor criterion were established empirically in the very careful manner .",
    "the example presented here illustrates that the different criteria give us stronger or weaker conclusions . in particular ,",
    "note that posterior probability criterion favors the model @xmath64 over the model @xmath65 . on the other hand",
    "the bayes factor criterion indicates that there is no preference between the models @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , this simple example gives us here the first lesson to be very careful interpreting statistical inference results .",
    "the second lesson is to be careful about results of estimations .",
    "the results presented above , base on the @xmath49-@xmath6 interval choice of the parameters intervals . in case of the @xmath66-@xmath6 intervals the resulting bayes factors are the following @xmath67 therefore , there the first model is weakly favored with respect to the third one . also the second model is weakly favored with respect to the third one .",
    "the first and the second models are indistinguishable .",
    "the @xmath66-@xmath6 results differ from these performed previously .",
    "the comparison between the @xmath49-@xmath6 and @xmath66-@xmath6 examples was performed to show explicitly the sensitivity of the bayesian inference on the parameter intervals .",
    "this dependence on the priors becomes significant in case of the _ weak data _",
    ", e.g. for the small sample size or significant error .",
    "for the _ strong data _ the impact from the priors becomes irrelevant . in the case",
    "considered here , the data sample is small and the significant errors are present . because of this , the inference is sensitive on the choice of the priors as observed .",
    "in this section we present some applications of bayesian inference in modern cosmology .",
    "the bayesian methods have been introduced to cosmology relatively late .",
    "the proliferation of dark energy models forced using the formal methods of model selection .",
    "starting from the pioneering work of m.  v. john and j.  v. narlikar @xcite the bayesian methods have become popular @xcite .",
    "the reason is that cosmology really needs these methods , because our knowledge about the universe is still very limited .",
    "we have a lot of theories about different stages of the universe but only a modest number of observations to verify them .",
    "so it is the right place for the bayesian methods .",
    "the first case that we would like to talk about is connected with very mysterious behavior of the universe , discovered in the end of the last decade .",
    "namely , observations of the distant type ia supernovae ( snia ) indicated that the universe expansion accelerates @xcite .",
    "this discovery was apparently in the conflict with other observations and beliefs that universe in filled with normal matter like dust , stars , planets etc . given this assumption the universe always decelerates .",
    "so what is happening in the universe ? why did it start to accelerate after a previous phase of deceleration ? what is the mysterious component of the universe that we call dark energy ?",
    "there is presently an enormous number of possible answers for this question .",
    "the presence of the cosmological constant @xmath68 , phantom fluid , modified gravity , field of quintessence , quantum gravitational effects , brane world models , vacuum energy and so on and so on .",
    "the number of possible solutions is really impressive .",
    "so , which one of them is the real solution ? which one describes nature in the right way ? or maybe none of them , maybe we still must be looking for new models .",
    "let us neglect the possibility of building new models to explain acceleration of the universe and limit ourselves only to some already proposed solutions .",
    "this is precisely what we can do thanks to bayesian inference .",
    "due to bayesian methods one can obtain a ranking of accelerating models @xcite .",
    "the analysis show that standard cosmological model , the so - called @xmath68cdm model , is on the top off all theoretical propositions @xcite .",
    "the assumed model of the universe is the friedmann - robertson - walker model filled with dust matter , dark and baryonic , and dark energy . in bayesian estimation of cosmological model parameters for these components",
    "we start from the cosmography which determines the luminosity function as the function of density parameters .",
    "the density parameters define the fraction of energy in the total energy budget of the universe .",
    "they are dimensionless and their sum is equal one .",
    "the additional parameter is the hubble constant which describes the rate of expansion of the current universe . while the kinematic part of the cosmology is controlled by cosmography basing on analysis of trajectories of photons , the observations of cmb control the dependence of perturbation on time .    among many theoretical propositions",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is the time - independent cosmological constant .",
    "the other propositions : the chaplygin gas , models with varying coefficient of the equation of state , quintessence , phantoms , etc .",
    "these models are fitted using the astronomical data : the measurement of absolute magnitudes of high redshift type ia supernovae , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , the measurement of baryon acoustic peak ( bao ) in galaxies correlation function , gas mass fraction value in galaxy clusters , gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) which are at higher redshift than snia .    in selection of cosmological models with different forms of dark energy different criteria",
    "the simplest criteria are the information criteria aic , bic and bayes factor , posterior probability .",
    "these methods allow us pick out the best model in the light of data at our disposal .",
    "this intriguing question corresponds to the presence of possible observational phenomena of quantum gravity .",
    "the quantum gravitational effects are predicted to be very small and unreachable by the present and any future generations of accelerators .",
    "however the quantum gravitational effect can survive as the relict from the very early universe in which quantum gravitational effects have been dominant .",
    "these effects can influence the spectrum of inflationary perturbations @xcite .",
    "these primordial fluctuations then lead to the fluctuations of matter and finally to the structures formation in the universe .",
    "so can we deduce some information about quantum gravity from observations of microwave background radiation and large scale structures ? at first glance it can sound strange because quantum gravity describes microscopic property of gravitational field at a very deep level .",
    "however the same effects were very important in the early universe and could influence its global properties .",
    "is here a place for bayesian inference ?",
    "the answer is _",
    "yes_. we have now a lot of predictions from quantum theories of gravity like loop quantum gravity @xcite and still a very limited number of observations in the region where they can be important , e.g. non - gaussianity in primordial fluctuation in cmb or the primordial gravitational waves spectrum .",
    "the two examples presented in this section are very important but they are not the only ones . there is a lot of other places in cosmology where bayesian inference is and should be applied . for example , we still do not know what the dark matter ( the second dominant component of the universe ) is .",
    "it may be an axion , higisno , gluino other super particles @xcite or just neutrinos etc .",
    "it is an ideal place for the bayesian inference to point out the best candidate .",
    "unfortunately still too little is known from observations .",
    "it is an obvious fact that bayes theorem is a theorem .",
    "nevertheless , it should be explicitly explained , that to be a bayesian is more than _ to know and use the theorem_. the bayesian theory of confirmation achieves a great success in such areas of human activity as physics , biology , medicine , cognitive science ( decision theory ) on the one hand , and encounters serious limitations of the analyzed method on the other hand .",
    "a radical bayesian would probably say that it can always be applied : we always have to do with a joint distribution and a numerical representation of belief is always possible .",
    "however , a bayesian epistemology could be treated not only as competing with other methods of confirmation , but as a way of making a specific ( not exclusive ) model of beliefs and related evidences , which can be easily elaborated and understood .    in the bayesian approach probability",
    "is attributed to hypotheses that are being confirmed .",
    "this confirmation can be interpreted both qualitatively and quantitatively , since inference is based on empirical data and there are relations between hypotheses , theories and observations to be explicated .",
    "it is indeed a crucial point in understanding bayesian inference  the meaning which is ascribed to probability . using probabilistic methods one can measure two things : how often a specific event occurs and how strong evidence ( confirming our beliefs ) is .",
    "let us generally state that bayesianism can be treated as an epistemic theory which examines the relation between beliefs and empirical evidence as to measure the strength of the beliefs . as it has been shown the most important concept used to gain that goal",
    "is the notion of conditional probability @xcite . using the bayesian inference we not only measure the strength of beliefs but also propose the method for rational estimating a change of the beliefs under the influence of a new evidence .",
    "sometimes , among scientists and philosophers of science , there is a bit of hesitation about exclusiveness of such an approach .",
    "s. okasha in his study on van frassen s conception of induction wrote @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ he accepts the bayesian representation of opinion in terms of degrees - of - belief , and he agrees that synchronic probabilistic coherence is a necessary condition of rationality .",
    "however , he does not accept the bayesian thesis that conditionalization is the only rational way to respond to new evidence ; though he allows that it is a rational way .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it can be said in that sense that bayesianism offers a solution to old problems of induction .",
    "we have got an approximately coherent and reasonable model for probability corrections .",
    "of course , it is possible if having initial probability and evidence ( priors ) .",
    "the proposed solution has its weakness : its method often tells nothing how to estimate these probabilities .",
    "the crucial point in bayesian inference lies in the fact that it is able to deal with the problem , only if we manage the input of some probabilities .",
    "it makes sense , since we never start reasoning with absolutely no knowledge .",
    "the result we achieve ",
    "@xmath69  are always `` conditional '' : it reveals a property of @xmath70 which is not objective , but related to @xmath71 and certain _ knowledge _ , called _",
    "background knowledge_. a more subtle epistemic analysis can be carried out with reference to the types of background knowledge .",
    "p. wang studied the problem of underlying knowledge and discerned two types of conditions which influence the evaluation of probability distribution function @xcite in the formulas , as follows :    * explicit conditions @xmath72 * * @xmath71 is a binary proposition , * * belongs to proposition space ( then we can define @xmath73 ) , * * @xmath74 ; * implicit conditions @xmath75 * * non - binary propositions allowed , * * there may be statements outside the proposition space , * * `` even if a proposition is assigned to a prior probability of zero according to one knowledge source , it is possible for the proposition to be assigned a non - zero probability according to another knowledge source '' .",
    "all these discernments are not trivial , since we have to answer the question : _ whether all the background knowledge can be probabilistic - valued?_. this is one of the most important epistemic questions of bayesian theory of confirmation , beside the others :    * _ are there degrees of belief ? _ the answer , maybe , lies in an attempt to distinguish ` rational ' degrees of belief from belief in general .",
    "are the corrections in probability , gained in the bayesian procedure , just new probabilistic information or do they deliver _ new reason to believe _ that the proposition considered is true ? * when are we actually updating our belief and when there is just a revision of probability ( known problem of old evidence ) ?    while elaborating empirical data in cosmology , one can use classical or bayesian statistics . in a classical approach we rely on the classical definition of likelihood , but doing the same _ bayesian way _ we are dealing with _ a priori _ and _ a posteriori _ probability , respectively .",
    "there is an opinion among some cosmologists that the standard approach ( _ the standard maximum - likelihood technique _ ) is satisfactory indeed , which is reasonable if there is a single model under consideration .",
    "when we have several competitive hypotheses , bayesian statistics would be a better choice .",
    "there are two groups among bayesians who differ from each other with respect to criteria used in choosing of priors : objective bayesians : e.  t. jaynes @xcite , h. jeffreys @xcite , r.  d. rosenkrantz @xcite ) and subjective bayesians : b.de  finetti @xcite , c. howson and p. urbach @xcite .",
    "it is not only the problem ( or problems ) of induction , that bayesian inference tries to deal with , but also the problem of finding a justification of induction inference itself , which can be explicated in several schemas :    * inductive generalization + nobody denies that a finite number of experimental data can not deliver an exhaustive proof to a universal statement but , according to induction , empirical evidence confirms generalization @xcite .",
    "an example of that is enumerative induction which principle explicates , as follow : + _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ several crows are black . + therefore , all crows are black . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ + _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ every load added so far has not damaged this truck . + therefore , the next piece of load will not damage this truck . _",

    "it may be a truism , but the difference between explanation and confirmation should be treated with special care .",
    "the more so because there is not a unity among bayesians concerning representation of the degree to which evidence supports an hypothesis .",
    "the most popular are three options : * * a difference measure : @xmath76 ; * * a normalized difference measure : @xmath77 ; * * a likelihood measure : @xmath78}{[1-p(h|e ) ] p(h)}$ ]    the inductive generalization , which has the simple pattern : extrapolation from particular data do general conclusions , suffers several problems called paradoxes of confirmation .",
    "goodman s paradox , know in the literature as problem of `` grue '' , is particularly interesting @xcite .",
    "especially the question of its counterpart in the field of cosmology . in a traditional version :    * we have two hypotheses : ( 1 ) all emeralds are green and ( 2 ) all emeralds are grue ( green if examined until some time @xmath79 and blue otherwise ) . * evidence : _ found emerald is green _ confirms both : ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "any satisfying resolutions to the paradox propose additional assumptions ; for example pointing out on `` green '' as a natural kind term instead of `` grue '' .    in a search for possible cosmological version of the paradox we can compare for example two related models the cold dark matter cosmological model ( cdm model ) and the lambda cold dark matter cosmological model with the positive cosmological constant term ( lcdm model ) .",
    "the latter seems to be the simplest candidate for the dark energy description .",
    "the bayesian method of confirmation dedicated to select between these two models reveals a quite opposite verdict while used in the 90s and currently . using the sample of perlmutter et al .",
    "@xcite there is not enough information to distinguish these models .",
    "the extended sample with additional 42 high @xmath80 snia @xcite gives a weak evidence to favor the lcdm model over the cdm one .",
    "however , in our opinion it is a misunderstanding to treat this study case as a paradox in goodman s sense .",
    "it becomes obvious , because when new observational data confirm better the lcdm model in comparison with the cdm model , the latter simply disappears out the stage .",
    "the paradox of confirmation would occur when related to a certain family of models there will be the same degree of confirmation ( the same time and evidence ) assigned to hypotheses differing from each other for example with regard to foreseeable future scenarios of universe evolution .",
    "to illustrate this situation let us consider two hypotheses    1 .",
    "the universe decelerates .",
    "the universe decelerates until some time @xmath79 and accelerates afterward .",
    "the cdm model is valid with the first hypothesis and the lcdm model is in agreement with the second one . from the 60 s",
    "it was known that the universe is expanding with the decelerating rate .",
    "so we have a  paradox here .",
    "however the evidences of accelerating universe due to snia data falsified the first model . and",
    "the paradox is naturally solved .",
    "this example teaches us that paradoxes of goodman s type ( in the logic of induction ) are common in evolutionary sciences but they are not dangers because we hope that new evidences ( which appear due to science development ) we discriminate between two hypotheses .    in goodman s paradox",
    "there is only one kind of evidence ; we need to draw an emerald and check its color . in the case of cosmological hypotheses",
    "we are not left with only one evidence .",
    "a  new evidence appears and resolves the paradox in favor of one of the hypothesis .",
    "it comes from new observations .",
    "we know that this evidence will appear eventually because we , scientists look for it .",
    "the reason that there is no paradox after a  new evidence appears , is that one hypotheses is falsified ( the cdm model ) and only one hypothesis ( the lcdm model ) becomes in agreement with this new evidence .",
    "it is often said that a scientific theoretical research means achieving two specific goals : ( 1 ) finding a model which approximates a phenomenon best and ( 2 ) constructing a hypothesis that offers best prediction .",
