    "to transmit data efficiently over wireless channels in wsns , existing schemes set some minimum transmission power for maintaining reliability .",
    "these schemes either decrease interference among nodes or unnecessary energy consumption .",
    "in order to adjust transmission power , reference node periodically broadcasts a beacon message .",
    "when neighbor nodes hear a beacon message from a reference node , neighbor nodes transmit an ack message . through this interaction , reference node estimate connectivity between neighbor nodes @xcite .    in local mean algorithm ( lma ) , a reference node broadcasts lifemsg message .",
    "neighbor nodes transmit lifeackmsg after they receive lifemsg .",
    "reference nodes count number of lifeackmsgs and transmission power is controlled by maintaining appropriate connectivity .",
    "for example if number of lifeackmsgs is less than nodeminthresh transmission power is increased .",
    "in contrast , if number of lifeackmsgs is more than nodemaxthresh transmission power is decreased . as a result , they provide improvement of network lifetime in a sufficiently connected network . however , lma only guarantees connectivity between nodes and can not estimate link quality @xcite .    local information no topology / local information link - state topology ( lint / lilt ) and dynamic transmission power control ( dtpc ) uses @xmath1 to estimate transmitter power level . nodes exceeding threshold @xmath1 are regarded as neighbor nodes with reliable links .",
    "transmission power also controlled by packet reception ratio ( prr ) metric @xcite .    since @xmath1 is directly proportional to temperature .",
    "adaptive transmission power control ( atpc ) adjusts transmission power dynamically according to spatial and temporal effects .",
    "this scheme tries to adapt link quality that changes over time by using closed - loop feedback .",
    "however , in large - scale wsns it is difficult to support scalability due to serious overhead required to adjust transmission power of each link  @xcite .",
    "existing approaches estimate variety of link quality indicators by periodically broadcasting a beacon message . in addition",
    ", feedback process is repeated for adaptively controlling transmission power . in adapting link quality for environments where temperature variation occur ,",
    "packet overhead for transmission power control should be minimized . reducing number of control packets",
    "while maintaining reliability is an important technical issue @xcite .",
    "our transmission power control scheme is designed to efficiently combine closed - loop and open - loop feedback processes to divide network into three logical regions .",
    "it utilizes open - loop process based on sensed temperature information to reduce overhead for transmission power control according to temperature variation . closed - loop feedback process based on control packets",
    "is further used to accurately adjust transmission power . by adopting both open - loop and closed - loop feedback processes we divide network into three regions , a for high @xmath1 , b for medium @xmath1 and c for low @xmath1 on basis of threshold @xmath1 for each region .    in order to assign minimum and reachable transmission power to each link east",
    "is designed .",
    "east has two phases that is initial and run - time . in initial phase , each node build a model for each of its neighbors links . the run - time phase based on previous model east",
    "adapts the link quality to dynamically maintain each link with respect to time . in a relatively stable network ,",
    "control overhead occurs only in measuring link quality in initial phase . in a relatively unstable network because link quality is continuously changing initial phase is repeated and serious overhead occur .",
    "before we present block diagram for our propose scheme some variables are defined as follows : ( 1 ) number of current neighbor nodes @xmath2 , ( 2 ) desired number of neighbor nodes @xmath3 , ( 3 ) error : e(t ) = @xmath4,(4 ) transmission power level @xmath5 .    in order to adjust transmission power , transmission power level determined as connectivity with neighbor nodes . after comparing number of current neighbor nodes with a set point desired number of neighbor nodes power controller",
    "adjusts transmission power level accordingly .",
    "prr , ack , and @xmath1 used to determine connectivity .",
    "ack estimate connectivity , it can not determine link quality .",
    "prr estimate connectivity accurately that causes significant overhead @xcite . in our scheme ,",
    "we use @xmath1 for connectivity estimation , which measure connectivity with relatively low overhead .",
    "power controller adjust transmission power level by utilizing both number of current neighbor nodes and temperature sensed at each neighbor node .",
    "since power controller is operated not merely by comparing number of current neighbor nodes with desired number also by using temperature - compensated power level , so that it reach to desired power level rapidly .",
    "if temperature is changing then temperature compensation is executed on basis of relationship between temperature and @xmath1 .",
    "network connectivity maintained with low overhead by reducing feedback process between nodes which is achieved due to logical division of network while link quality is changing due to temperature variation .",
    "transmission power loss due to temperature variation formulated using relationship between @xmath1 and temperature experimented in bannister et al .. mathematical expression for @xmath1 due to temperature variation is as follows @xcite :    @xmath6=0.1996*(t[c^{o}]-25[c^{o}])\\ ] ]    to compensate @xmath1 estimated from eq.(1 ) we have to control output power of radio transmitter accordingly .",
    "relationship between required transmitter power level and @xmath1 is formulated by eq.(2 ) using least square approximation @xcite :    @xmath7=[(rssi_{loss}+40)/12]^{2.91}\\ ] ]    based on eqs ( 1 , 2 ) , we obtain appropriate power level to compensate @xmath1 due to temperature variation . to compensate path loss due to distance between each sensor node in wsn free space model help to estimate actual required transmitter power .",
    "after addition of required power level due to temperature variation and distance given in eq.(3 ) , we estimate actual required transmitter power between each sensor node . for free space path loss model",
    "we need number of nodes , distance between each node , required @xmath8 depends upon @xmath9 , spectral efficiency @xmath10 , frequency @xmath11 and receiver noise figure @xmath12 required :    @xmath13=[\\eta*(e_{b}/n_{0})*mktb*(4\\pi d /\\lambda ) ^2+rnf]+p_{level}\\ ] ]    our scheme aims to simplify transmission power control by compensating @xmath1 change based on temperature information sensed at each node .",
    "propose compensation scheme does not require any communication overhead with neighbor nodes , rather utilizes information gathered from temperature sensor .",
    "open - loop control reduce significantly complexity of closed - loop feedback control for transmission power control .",
    "we define important parameters for our propose scheme,(1 ) @xmath1 threshold for each region .",
    "( 2 ) number of desired neighbor nodes in each region @xmath14 , ( 3 ) transmission power level for each region .",
    "threshold @xmath1 is minimum value required to maintain link reliability .",
    "reference node broadcasts beacon message periodically to neighbor nodes and wait acks .",
    "if acks are received from neighbor nodes then @xmath1 is estimated for logical division of network , number of nodes with high @xmath1 considered in region a , medium @xmath1 considered in region b , and with low @xmath1 in region c. if ( @xmath1 @xmath15 @xmath1 threshold ) and ( @xmath16 ) then threshold transmitter power level assigned if for similar case ( @xmath17 ) then similar transmitter power assigned and if ( @xmath1 @xmath18 @xmath1 threshold ) then by default keep same transmitter power level .",
    "given below is complete algorithm for east .",
    "in this section we describe simulation results of our propose technique for power efficient transmission in wsns compared with classical approach used for transmission of data . in fig1",
    "we have shown values of meteorological temperature for one round that each sensor node have sensed in wsn .",

    "shown earlier temperature variation shown on y - axis and corresponding nodes on x - axis .",
    "each sensor node placed at different location randomly in given area and we clearly see variation of temperature for different nodes in wsn .",
    "different values of temperature for each sensor node based on meteorological condition help to estimate @xmath21 that is transmitter power loss .",

    "@xmath21 on y - axis indicates transmission power loss for each sensor node . @xmath21",

    ".estimated parameters [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : addlabel ]    from figure shown earlier it is also clear that link quality and @xmath1 have inverse relation , when temperature is high @xmath1 has high value means low quality link and vise versa . as we have earlier mentioned link quality and @xmath1 have inverse relation that is for high temperature link quality is not good and for low temperature link quality is good . after estimating @xmath1 for each node in wsn we compute corresponding transmitter power level to compensate @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath5 assigned to each node on basis of nodes estimated @xmath1 .",
    "fig2 shows range of power levels on y - axis for given @xmath1 that is between ( 20- 47 ) @xmath25 and also variation of required power level for sensor node with changing temperature that is at low temperature required @xmath5 is low and for high temperature required @xmath5 is high .        as we have earlier estimated @xmath1 for each sensor node on the basis of given meteorological temperature that help to estimate required power level to compensate transmission power loss .",
