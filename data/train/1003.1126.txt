    "this auxiliary material is organized as follows :    in section i , we give more detailed information on our experimental setup .    in section",
    "ii , we discuss a model that describes for known surface potential @xmath11 how the atoms are lost when the trap is ramped towards the surface of the undriven cantilever ( see solid lines in fig .  2 of the paper ) .",
    "the model was originally developed in @xcite .",
    "we discuss several refinements of the model compared to @xcite and show that our analysis is independent of model details .    in section iii , we describe how we calibrate the atom - surface distance @xmath37 and obtain information about the surface potential @xmath137 .",
    "the analysis combines measurements of atom loss in @xmath11 as in fig .  2 of the paper with measurements of the strength of the dynamical coupling as in fig .",
    "we discuss rb adsorbates on the cantilever surface as a likely explanation for the observed additional surface potential @xmath6 .",
    "while this analysis provides further insight into the surface potential , we point out that the experiments on dynamical atom - cantilever coupling presented in our paper do not rely on a certain type of surface potential and do not require precise knowledge of @xmath11 .",
    "the strong decay of @xmath11 with @xmath37 , which is a general feature of surface potentials , allows one to adjust the strength of the interaction to a desired value by adjusting @xmath37 .    in section iv",
    ", we point out limitations due to collisional loss and technical heating observed in the attempt to approach the surface as closely as possible by using traps with higher trap frequency .",
    "we discuss how these limitations could be partially circumvented .",
    "the oscillator in our experiment is a commercial sin afm cantilever of dimensions @xmath25 m with a @xmath138 nm thick au / cr mirror on one side for optical readout .",
    "cantilever oscillations can be excited with a piezo .",
    "we calibrate the mechanical oscillation amplitude @xmath63 by implementing a laser beam deflection readout @xcite .",
    "it involves a readout laser at @xmath139 nm that is focused onto and reflected from the cantilever tip .",
    "the angular deflection of the beam is detected with a quadrant photodiode and a lock - in amplifier .",
    "the readout has a sensitivity of @xmath140 , which allows us to resolve the thermal motion of the fundamental mode .",
    "comparison with the driven cantilever amplitude yields a piezo driving efficiency of @xmath141nm / vpp on resonance .",
    "we measure a cantilever frequency @xmath26khz and a quality factor @xmath142 for the fundamental out - of - plane mode , where @xmath143 is the @xmath144 amplitude decay time . a slow drift ( over days ) towards lower @xmath19 is observed . it does not depend on whether experiments are performed , and we attribute it to aging of the layered au / cr / sin structure .",
    "the cantilever chip is glued onto a spacer , ensuring a convenient separation of @xmath145 m between cantilever and atom chip surface .",
    "the cantilever subassembly is glued onto an aln chip with microfabricated gold wires for magnetic trapping of atoms ( see fig .  1 of the paper ) .",
    "the wires are defined photolithographically and grown to @xmath146 m thickness in an electroplating process @xcite",
    ". the chip forms the top wall of a glass cell vacuum chamber @xcite with @xmath147  mbar background pressure .",
    "the atom chip has a loading region with a dielectric mirror to operate a mirror - magneto - optical trap ( mirror mot ) @xcite , which collects @xmath148 atoms during @xmath73s loading .",
    "after @xmath36ms of optical molasses cooling the atoms are pumped into state @xmath28 and trapped magnetically .",
    "the subassembly with the mechanical cantilever is located at a lateral distance of @xmath149 mm from the mot center . to transport the cloud to the cantilever , we use a wire guide @xcite with a superimposed axial quadrupole field from external coils , which can be shifted by a homogeneous field along the wire axis .    at the cantilever ,",
    "the atoms are held in a cigar - shaped ioffe trap , created by currents in a @xmath150 m wide ioffe wire and a crossing `` dimple '' wire in combination with homogeneous bias fields @xcite ( see fig . 1 of the paper ) .",
    "the trap frequency @xmath18 can be widely adjusted ( up to @xmath151khz ) while maintaining @xmath152 for a large range of distances @xmath15 from the atom chip surface .",
    "we perform radio - frequency evaporative cooling @xcite with a first stage at @xmath153 m from the cantilever surface .",
    "pure becs of typically @xmath154 atoms are then produced in a second stage at @xmath29 m in a trap with @xmath155=2\\pi\\times[0.6 , 2.8]~$]khz , after an overall evaporation time of @xmath156s .",
    "the lifetime in this trap is @xmath157s , close to the pressure limited lifetime of @xmath158s far away from surfaces .",
    "typical parameters for coupling to the cantilever are currents @xmath159a and homogeneous bias fields @xmath160 g ( see fig . 1 of the paper ) , which results in @xmath161 m and @xmath162  khz . for this trap , @xmath64 m , @xmath163  khz , and @xmath164  nm . three - body collisional loss and technical heating depend on trap frequency and limit the bec lifetime to 18  ms ( 55  ms ) for @xmath165  khz ( @xmath166  khz ) close to the surface .",
    "we calibrate @xmath13 in the different traps by trap modulation spectroscopy .",
    "we modulate the ioffe current such that the trap minimum is modulated along the @xmath167-axis . for traps close to the cantilever",
    "this has a similar effect as the oscillating cantilever .",
    "we also use trap loss for readout in this measurement .",
    "the observed loss resonances have a relatively large width of @xmath168hz for @xmath169khz , indicating trap anharmonicity .",
    "the measured trap frequency is thus not @xmath13 , the value corresponding to the undisturbed trap , but corresponds to the inverse of the oscillation period for rather large amplitude oscillations in the deformed trap .",
    "as this is the relevant frequency for the coupling measurements , we refer to it as @xmath18 .",
    "the relative uncertainty in the obtained @xmath18 is @xmath170 , which is also the amount of anharmonicity ( for a cloud oscillating up to the barrier a simulation yields @xmath171 anharmonicity ) .",
    "a simulation of the trapping potential ( see chapter iii ) deviates from the measured frequencies by less than @xmath172 .    for measurements on the unmetallized backside of the cantilever , we transport thermal clouds around the cantilever and prepare the bec there .",
    "the clouds are imaged after transporting back around the cantilever .",
    "we have no clear signature of condensation in this trap due to heating during transport . from a fit to the measurements in fig . 2 in the paper ( see below ) , we find that the temperatures are @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the critical temperature for bec .",
    "here we discuss the model for the loss of atoms in the attractive surface potential @xmath11 of the undriven cantilever ( see solid lines in fig .  2 of the paper ) .",
    "a simple model describing such measurements was developed in @xcite .",
    "when the trapping potential is ramped to the surface , the trap depth @xmath12 is reduced by @xmath11 .",
    "the model assumes that this leads to a sudden loss of the tail of the boltzmann distribution of the residual thermal cloud at temperature @xmath175 coexisting with the condensate .",
    "furthermore , it includes 1d evaporation from the trap at the reduced @xmath12 during the hold time @xmath83 . according to this model ,",
    "the remaining fraction of atoms in the trap is given by @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the ratio of the trap depth and the thermal energy and @xmath178 is the evaporation rate .",
    "it contains the elastic collision time @xmath179 and a dimensionless factor @xmath180 , which accurately describes 1d evaporation for @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "evaporation is important when @xmath182 . in the measurement of fig .  2 of the paper , @xmath183ms and @xmath38ms , so that evaporation has only a small effect .",
    "similarly , tunneling through the barrier , which can be accounted for by a small reduction of @xmath12 , has only a minor effect for our parameters . in comparing with the data , we leave @xmath175 as a free parameter .",
    "a fit to the data yields @xmath184 ( solid lines from left to right in fig .",
    "2 ) , where @xmath174 is the critical temperature for bec in the corresponding traps . these values are systematically larger but still in reasonable agreement with those from independent measurements of @xmath175 in time - of - flight for corresponding traps on the metallized side .",
    "although this simple model already describes our data fairly well , several improvements are possible :    \\(i ) the model describes all atoms as being in the thermal cloud .",
    "a more accurate description can be obtained by assuming a bimodal cloud for @xmath185 , with a thermal component of @xmath186 atoms and a condensate of @xmath187 atoms @xcite .",
    "the condensate chemical potential is @xmath188 and the critical temperature for bec is given by @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath190 is the mean trap frequency , @xmath191 nm the scattering length , and @xmath192 the mean oscillator length .",
    "the thermal cloud is lost for @xmath193 as described above with a modified @xmath194 .",
    "the condensate is lost for @xmath195 , where the number of remaining atoms @xmath39 can be determined from @xmath196=u_0 $ ] .",
    "( ii ) most of the surface loss occurs for @xmath197 , where the simple evaporation law is no longer valid and leads to unphysically large @xmath198 .",
    "we correct this by introducing a cutoff at the cross dimensional mixing rate @xcite , which we implement by setting @xmath199 .",
    "( iii ) the repulsive interaction between the condensate and the thermal cloud pushes the latter out of the trap center , which leads to a broadening of the loss curves .",
    "this effect could be included by an effective potential @xmath200 for the thermal cloud .",
    "( iv ) technical heating , three - body collisional loss , and cooling due to evaporation of the atoms are not included in the model .",
    "these effects have a strong dependence on trap frequency .    by implementing the above improvements ( i ) and ( ii )",
    ", we found that the resulting change in the calibration of the atom - cantilever distance @xmath37 is @xmath201 nm , which is within our error bar on @xmath37 ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , we point out that the data can also be analyzed without a detailed model for atom loss by simply exploiting that @xmath44 corresponds to the values of the atom - cantilever distance @xmath37 where the trap has vanished ( which is well described by the condition @xmath202 ) .",
    "this analysis depends only on the knowledge of the trapping potential @xmath21 , and again yields similar results as the model described above for the short @xmath83 of the measurements in fig .  2 , where evaporation does not play an important role .",
    "here we describe in detail how we use the atoms to obtain information about the surface potential @xmath4 and a calibration of the atom - cantilever distance @xmath30 on both sides of the cantilever .",
    "the analysis combines information from measurements of atom loss in the surface potential as in fig .  2 of the paper with measurements of the strength of the dynamical coupling as in fig .",
    "a first rough estimate of the cantilever - chip distance @xmath203 m is obtained from the knowledge of the spacer chip thickness ( @xmath204 m ) on which the cantilever is mounted and the thickness of the glue layers . here",
    ", @xmath8 refers to the position of the surface of the metallized side of the cantilever .",
    "the surface of the dielectric side is located at @xmath205 , where @xmath206 nm is the cantilever thickness specified by the manufacturer and confirmed in electron microscope images .    for a more precise determination of @xmath8",
    "we use several measurements of atom loss in the surface potential as shown in fig .  2 of the paper .",
    "in these measurements , the position of the magnetic trap minimum , @xmath15 , is obtained from a simulation of the magnetic trapping potential @xmath3 .",
    "our simulation takes into account the finite width and length of the wires as well as the rectangular geometry of the three pairs of coils generating magnetic bias fields .",
    "we check the simulated @xmath3 by comparison with measurements of the trap frequencies , the magnetic field at the trap bottom , and the trap position in absorption images . from this",
    "we estimate a relative uncertainty in @xmath15 of @xmath207 .",
    "this leads to an absolute uncertainty of @xmath208 m at @xmath209 m .",
    "this is also the absolute uncertainty in the @xmath167-axis in fig .  2 of the paper .",
    "a crucial point in our measurements is that we can approach the cantilever from both sides , using the atoms as a `` caliper '' . because the cantilever has to lie somewhere in the region where @xmath44 in fig .  2 ,",
    "this allows us to determine the absolute cantilever position @xmath210 m with an uncertainty comparable to the uncertainty in @xmath15 .",
    "however , we point out that the uncertainty in @xmath37 is much smaller than the absolute uncertainties in @xmath15 and @xmath8 .",
    "this is so because the distance between magnetic traps right above and below the cantilever is known to @xmath211 nm ( corresponding to the @xmath207 relative uncertainty in @xmath15 ) .",
    "for perfectly known surface potentials @xmath11 , this would also be the uncertainty in @xmath37 .",
    "the dominant contribution to the uncertainty in @xmath37 is due to the a priori unknown additional surface potential @xmath6 .",
    "if we assume for the moment that only the cp - potentials are present on both sides of the cantilever ( i.e.  @xmath212 on both sides ) , we would expect from a simulation of @xmath213 that the `` effective cantilever thickness '' @xmath214 , defined by the width of the window where @xmath44 in fig .",
    "2 , is @xmath215 m for @xmath216  khz and @xmath38ms .",
    "however , we observe @xmath217 m .",
    "this shows that @xmath11 is significantly stronger than the expected contribution from @xmath5 on at least one side of the cantilever .",
    "we explain this by the presence of an additional potential @xmath6 due to surface inhomogeneities or contamination @xcite . without taking into account further information about @xmath6 ,",
    "this leaves an uncertainty in @xmath37 of @xmath218  nm , corresponding to the difference between the observed and expected @xmath214",
    ".    the atoms could be used as a three - dimensional scanning probe that allows one to map out the spatial dependence of @xmath6 in detail and to determine whether it is due to magnetic , electrostatic , or other interactions , see e.g.  the measurements in @xcite . as the characterization of @xmath6 is not the main focus of our present paper",
    ", we simply determine its strength relative to @xmath5 in the relevant range of @xmath37 by combining the measurements in fig .  2 with information from measurements of dynamic atom - cantilever coupling as in fig .",
    "3 of the paper .",
    "we couple the atoms to the cantilever motion and measure the contrast @xmath74 of the atomic signal for several cantilever amplitudes @xmath63 , using a trap with @xmath31khz so that @xmath219 .",
    "we find linear dependences both for @xmath220 in the experiment ( as long as @xmath85 ) and for @xmath86 in the simulation of @xmath21 , which implies a linear dependence @xmath221 .",
    "such measurements are performed on both sides of the cantilever in traps with similar @xmath12 .",
    "we can determine @xmath12 to @xmath123 from the measured curves in fig .  2 without detailed knowledge of @xmath11 or @xmath37 .",
    "comparing measurements on both sides of the cantilever , we find that @xmath87 is a factor @xmath222 larger on the metallized side . because of the observed linearity of the coupling",
    ", we conclude that @xmath223 has to be larger by the same factor @xmath224 .",
    "this implies a stronger surface potential on the metallized side .",
    "stronger @xmath11 also implies larger @xmath37 to maintain the same @xmath12 . due to the fast decay of @xmath11 with @xmath37 ,",
    "a substantially larger @xmath11 is required on the metallized side ( not just larger by a factor of order @xmath224 ) .",
    "a likely explanation for the observed @xmath6 are @xmath0rb adsorbates deposited during operation of the experiment .",
    "this effect was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the electric dipole moment of rb on gold , @xmath225 cm , is about one order of magnitude stronger than on sin @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as most of the measurements are performed above the metallized surface , we estimate the adsorbed atom number on this side to be substantially larger than on the dielectric backside of the cantilever",
    ". both effects would lead to a stronger @xmath6 on the metallized side .",
    "the distance - dependence of the generated @xmath6 depends on the spatial distribution of adsorbates on the surface .",
    "the condensates from our cigar - shaped trap would result in an elongated distribution of adsorbates .",
    "this can be roughly approximated by a line of dipoles , for which the potential is given by @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the @xmath0rb ground state polarizability and @xmath228 the electric field generated by the adsorbates @xcite .",
    "our analysis is an iterative procedure in which we first choose a certain @xmath229 and then evaluate @xmath230 and @xmath37 for the given @xmath12 on the dielectric side .",
    "this fixes the cantilever position @xmath8 .",
    "then we adjust @xmath229 on the metallized side to be consistent with the surface loss curves in fig .  2 and extract @xmath230 for the given @xmath12 on this side .",
    "we compare the values of @xmath230 on both sides and start a new iteration with weaker ( stronger ) @xmath229 on the dielectric side if their ratio is smaller ( larger ) than the observed @xmath224 , or finish if it equals the observed @xmath224 .",
    "the observed @xmath231 as well as the surface loss curves can be best explained by @xmath50 on the dielectric side and @xmath49 on the metallized side .",
    "the cp - coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath232 are given in the main text .",
    "for these potentials , @xmath233 m results .",
    "the potential on the metallized side could be generated by @xmath234 rb atoms distributed over an area of @xmath235m@xmath53 , about two times the size of a condensate .",
    "this is a realistic atom number consistent with the number of experiments performed .",
    "to check the robustness of our analysis against changes in the assumed distance - dependence of @xmath6 , we performed similar analyses with other distance - dependences , such as @xmath236 on both sides or @xmath237 on the dielectric side and @xmath236 on the metallized side .",
    "these analyses result in similar calibrations of @xmath37 .",
    "the overall error in @xmath37 is @xmath43 nm , which contains the uncertainty in @xmath6 , @xmath15 , @xmath12 , @xmath224 , as well as in the cantilever thickness , and a contribution due to residual oscillations of the atoms in the trap due to the ramping to the cantilever .    in our experiment",
    ", we observe that @xmath6 slowly changes over time by up to a factor of four on a time scale of weeks .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that atoms are deposited on the surface and subsequently diffuse or desorb again @xcite .",
    "the measurements used to determine @xmath6 described above were all performed on the same day .",
    "the change in @xmath6 during the course of these measurements is negligible .    on the dielectric side , the thin sin layer together with the au / cr film acts as a cavity or waveguide for the vacuum modes , which results in a correction to the cp - potential @xcite . at @xmath238 m",
    "this leads to a @xmath239% larger cp - potential , but only to a negligible shift ( @xmath240 nm ) of @xmath8 or @xmath37 .",
    "in the attempt to approach the surface as closely as possible by using traps with higher @xmath18 , we observe limitations due to three - body collisional loss and technical heating .",
    "inelastic collisions lead to a density dependent loss rate @xmath241 with @xmath242  m@xmath243s for @xmath0rb atoms in state @xmath28 @xcite . for our coupling trap with @xmath31khz ( @xmath32khz ) and a bec atom number @xmath244 ,",
    "the mean density is @xmath245  @xmath246 ( @xmath247  @xmath246 ) , giving rise to @xmath248hz ( @xmath249hz ) .",
    "three - body loss restricts experiments to low atom number and detains from higher trap frequencies .",
    "one way of circumventing this to some degree is to use pancake - shaped traps , e.g.  an optical trap , which has reduced density at a given @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , we point out that by using single atoms instead of becs for atom - cantilever coupling , collisional loss can be circumvented . with single atoms ,",
    "trap frequencies of the order of @xmath35mhz are possible @xcite , which would allow for @xmath250  nm near a thick metallic object . near nanoscale objects with weaker surface potentials , even smaller @xmath37",
    "could be achieved .",
    "technical current noise leads to fluctuations of the trap position @xmath17 and the trap frequency @xmath18 , resulting in heating @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath17 result in a linear increase in atom cloud temperature that scales with @xmath251 , while fluctuations in @xmath18 lead to an exponential temperature increase that scales with @xmath252 . for a trap",
    "far from the surface with @xmath31khz ( @xmath32khz ) we observe thermalization of condensates within @xmath253ms ( @xmath73ms ) . at an atom - surface distance of @xmath254 m ( @xmath255 m ) , where @xmath12 is decreased to @xmath256 ( @xmath257 ) , the measured condensate lifetime increases and is no longer limited by thermalization .",
    "we attribute this to the cooling effect of surface evaporation . here , one is rather limited by atom loss , and we observe a trap lifetime of @xmath258ms ( @xmath259ms ) .",
    "the loss and heating rates impose a limit on the hold time @xmath83 close to the surface .",
    "we observe an optimum in @xmath83 that depends on the trap geometry and current noise level .",
    "optimization of the trap geometry and reduction of current noise would enable smaller @xmath37 and larger @xmath83 , thus increasing the atom - cantilever coupling strength and the observed signal .",
    "we find no influence of atom loss due to thermal magnetic near - field noise in our experiment .",
    "such noise is generated by the johnson current noise in conducting materials and can drive atomic spin flips , leading to loss of atoms from the trap @xcite .",
    "due to the small amount of metallic material on the cantilever , this mechanism does not reduce the trap lifetime to below @xmath35s at @xmath260 m and is negligible compared to the observed pressure - limited background loss rate for @xmath261 m ."
