    "a partial differential equation @xmath0 known in the literature as camassa - holm equation is a fine example of an integrable system with many interesting and rather unusual properties . as an integrable equation it was discovered in @xcite , @xcite , but equation ( [ cceq0 ] ) had not been really noticed until the publication @xcite where the authors proposed it as a model for shallow water waves .",
    "moreover , camassa and holm have shown that in the case @xmath1 equation ( [ cceq0 ] ) possesses a peculiar solution with a cusp @xmath2 which they called a `` peakon '' .",
    "moreover , they also found exact multi - peakon solutions .",
    "the paper of camassa and holm has triggered an enormous avalanche of publications with the developments of mathematical theory for this new class of integrable systems and speculations about possible applications of the camassa - holm equation to the theory of shallow water waves ( including the problem of tsunami , @xcite ) and other long wave asymptotic theories .    there were a number of publications where authors raised some criticism to the original derivation and proposed new versions of the derivations starting from the reduction of the green - naghdi model , reduction of the generalised serre model or a direct multiscaling asymptotic expansion of the euler equation ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the main concern of these derivations was to achieve a fine adjustment of the coefficients in the first few terms of the asymptotic expansion in order to make the equation corresponding to the truncated expansion integrable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to point out that the camassa - holm equation does not correspond to any dominant balance in the asymptotic expansion and thus it does not represent a long wave asymptotic for water waves .",
    "we have analysed the above derivations and found them inconsistent with the basic principles of asymptotic theory .",
    "indeed , one can not keep the first principal asymptotic contribution ( corresponding to the korteweg  de vries theory ) together with the next asymptotic correction , then truncate the expansion and balance these two contributions by a re - scaling .",
    "such a re - scaling contains the small asymptotic parameter and thus violates the original assumption about the ratio of the water depth and the characteristic wave length .",
    "we have computed the next ( neglected in the above derivations ) term of the expansion and have shown that after the proposed re - scaling it is of the same order as any term accounted in the camassa - holm equation . moreover",
    ", the parameter @xmath3 in ( [ cceq0 ] ) appears in denominators of the neglected terms and thus can not be set to zero ( for the existence of peakon solutions ) in any long - wave asymptotic theory .",
    "here we should mention that the fact that the peakon solutions are irrelevant for shallow water waves was well understood earlier and published in @xcite , @xcite . using the exact soliton solution of the camassa - holm equation we have shown that the neglected terms are of the same order as terms accounted in equation ( [ cceq0 ] ) .",
    "in this section , following @xcite , we give a sketch of long wave asymptotic expansion beyond the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) theory .",
    "we shall illustrate the derivation of the camassa - holm equation following @xcite , @xcite and point out where the inconsistency occurs .",
    "also we will show that the terms neglected in the theory of the camassa - holm equation are of the same order as any term accounted in ( [ cceq0 ] ) .",
    "we claim that the inconsistency can not be removed if one uses a reduction of the green - naghdi model ( which itself is an approximation ) , or by choosing the value of the velocity potential inside of the flow ( @xcite ) or by any other method .",
    "we shall neglect the surface tension , since it does not affect our argument but simply makes expressions look more complicated .",
    "also we shall neglect viscosity and compressibility of water .",
    "two dimensional motion of vorticity free fluid is described by the potential @xmath4 of the velocity field @xmath5 . in the bulk of the fluid",
    "the potential satisfies the laplace equation @xmath6 with the boundary condition @xmath7 at the bottom @xmath8 . at the free surface of the fluid @xmath9",
    "there are kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath12 is the undisturbed depth of water .",
    "long wave asymptotic expansion assumes a small parameter @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a typical wavelength of the wave .",
    "another dimensionless small parameter of the theory is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a typical amplitude of the wave .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath17 .",
    "actually one can set @xmath18 and develop the theory with one parameter , but following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite we shall keep both parameters for better control over the terms .",
    "introducing dimensionless variables @xmath19 we re - write the above system of equations in the form : @xmath20_{z=0}=0 \\label{bottom } \\\\   & & \\left[\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\phi_{z}- \\mu \\eta_{x}\\phi_{x } -   \\eta_{t}\\right]_{z=1 + \\mu\\eta(x , t)}=0 \\label{kinematic } \\\\ & & \\left[\\phi_{t } + \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\mu\\phi^{2}_{x } + \\frac{\\mu}{\\epsilon}\\phi^{2}_{z } \\right ) +   \\eta\\right]_{z=1 + \\mu\\eta(x , t ) } = 0   \\label{dynamic } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    starting from here we shall develop asymptotic expansion as a series in @xmath21 .",
    "we shall illustrate the derivation the camassa - holm equation with corrections in three steps .",
    "we begin with the derivation of the boussinesq expansion up to the order @xmath22 .",
    "then , following @xcite , we make a reduction to the kdv theory describing unidirectional wave propagation .",
    "finally we transform the equation obtained to the form ( [ cceq0 ] ) , keeping terms of order @xmath22 to demonstrate that the camassa - holm equation does not represent a long wave asymptotic for surface waves .",
    "the boussinesq expansion aims to eliminate the dependence on the vertical coordinate @xmath23 and reduce ( [ laplace ] ) - ( [ dynamic ] ) to a system of equations on the elevation @xmath24 and the horizontal component of the velocity field at the bottom @xmath25 . in this section",
    "we shall follow the construction presented in detail in @xcite ( chapter 13.11 ) , but will keep more terms in the expansion .",
    "it follows from the laplace equation ( [ laplace ] ) and the boundary condition at the bottom ( [ bottom ] ) that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the value of the potential @xmath28 at the bottom .",
    "their solution does not satisfy the boundary condition at @xmath29 ( presumably due to a misprint ) . to rectify the misprint one has to replace @xmath23 by @xmath30 in the right hand side of ( 2.7),(2.8 ) in @xcite .",
    "] , and thus @xmath31 .    in order to reduce the system ( [ laplace ] ) - ( [ dynamic ] ) to two equations for functions",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 we substitute @xmath34 ( [ phiexp ] ) , in ( [ kinematic ] ) and ( [ dynamic ] ) , then we differentiate in @xmath35 the equations obtained from ( [ dynamic ] ) and replace @xmath36 by @xmath37 in the both equations . keeping terms of order @xmath38",
    "we get @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "first two lines in ( [ bc1]),([bc2 ] ) coincide with equation ( 2.9 ) in @xcite ( in our paper it is the term proportional to @xmath41 in ( [ bc1 ] ) ) . ] . for the purpose of our paper",
    "we are keeping the next order in the expansion .",
    "there are no obstructions to find higher order terms if required",
    ".      system ( [ bc1]),([bc2 ] ) describes waves propagating in both direction .",
    "there are many ways to reduce it to unidirectional wave propagation . in order to be consistent with @xcite",
    "we employ the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "namely , we shall assume @xmath42\\ ] ] and request that equations ( [ bc1]),([bc2 ] ) coincide upon this assumption , that would enable us to determine the coefficients @xmath43 $ ] . keeping terms with @xmath44",
    "we get    @xmath45    here @xmath46 denotes integration .",
    "assuming @xmath47 rapidly enough as @xmath48 one can set @xmath49 .",
    "the first line of the expansion ( [ w ] ) one can find in @xcite , terms @xmath50 were derived in @xcite and @xcite , here we extend the expansion to the terms @xmath51 of order @xmath52 .",
    "substitution of ( [ w ] ) in either ( [ bc1 ] ) or ( [ bc2 ] ) leads to equation @xmath53 the first line of this expansion is the standard korteweg  de vries equation , corrections in the second line is the well known result ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . for the purpose of our paper",
    "we proceed to the terms of order @xmath52 .",
    "following @xcite we shall apply the galilean and asymptotically invertible near - identity transformations to equation ( [ kdv ] ) .",
    "the purpose of these transformations is to bring the first two lines of equation ( [ kdv ] ) in the form , which can be re - scaled to equation ( [ cceq0 ] ) .",
    "first we apply the galilean transformation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant which will be determined later .",
    "then we perform the kodama transformation @xmath56 to a new dependent variable @xmath57 .",
    "and finally we apply the helmholtz operator @xmath58 to the equation obtained .    in the galilean transformation and the helmholtz operator we set @xmath59 and @xmath60 in order to vanish the coefficients at the terms @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "the choice @xmath63 excludes the term @xmath64 and guarantees ( see details in @xcite ) that the first line of the resulting equation @xmath65 can be re - scaled to ( [ cceq0 ] ) .    until this stage",
    "the asymptotic theory is consistent and equation ( [ transformed ] ) is asymptotically equivalent to the kdv expansion .",
    "the first line of ( [ transformed ] ) was derived in @xcite , our contribution is in the retaining of the next corrections in the asymptotic expansion ( the last three lines in ( [ transformed ] ) ) .",
    "analysing the publications with derivations of the camassa - holm equation as a long wave asymptotic expansion we notice that they have a similar pattern .",
    "starting from the euler equation or a certain well established model of water waves ( the green - naghdi model , the generalised serre model , etc ) the authors arrive to the equation similar ( up to an inessential re - scaling with constant coefficients ) to the first line of ( [ transformed ] ) .",
    "then they truncate the expansion at this level and re - scale it to the form ( [ cceq0 ] ) .",
    "we shall do the same re - scaling , but accounting the next correction .",
    "the most general re - scaling of variables that transforms the first line of equation ( [ transformed ] ) into ( [ cceq0 ] ) is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath68 .",
    "the re - scaling ( [ rescaling ] ) balances the terms in the the equation by eliminating the small parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( except the the term with @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that after this re - scaling the small parameters disappear from the correction ( the last three lines in ( [ transformed ] ) ) , which takes the form @xmath71 + one can also demonstrate that the small parameters disappear from all higher corrections",
    ".    one could hope that for the exact soliton or peakon solutions the correction term ( [ correcswithomega ] ) and all higher corrections vanish .",
    "it is obviously not the case for peakons , moreover the constant @xmath3 , which has to be set zero ( for the existence of peakons ) is in the denominator",
    ". it does not happen with solitons either . to show that we used the exact soliton solution of equation ( [ cceq0 ] ) taken from @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is",
    "an arbitrary constant satisfying condition @xmath74 and @xmath75 is a function of @xmath76 implicitly given by equation @xmath77    @xmath78{fig1a.eps } } & { \\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{fig1b.eps } } & { \\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{fig1c.eps } }   \\end{array}$ ]    taking @xmath79 we compared a contribution from one of the terms of the camassa - holm equation with the value of the correction ( [ correcswithomega ] ) .",
    "it is shown on fig.1 that the correction ( [ correcswithomega ] ) is much bigger then a contribution from the term of the equation ( [ cceq0 ] ) evaluated on the soliton solution with this choice of parameters and this fact does not depend on the choice of the term .",
    "the re - scaling ( [ rescaling ] ) is a basic error , which leads to the inconsistency with the long wave asymptotic theory .",
    "indeed , suppose we have started from equation ( [ cceq0 ] ) and have found its solution of a size or characteristic wavelength @xmath80 .",
    "re - scaling this solution to the variable @xmath81 we find from ( [ rescaling ] ) that the size in this variable is @xmath82 . since the galilean transformation ( [ gal ] ) does not change the scale , the wave has the same size in the variable @xmath35 .",
    "coming back to the physical dimensional variable @xmath83 we realise that the size of the wave is @xmath84 which is in contradiction with the long wave assumption @xmath85",
    ".    one can consider solutions of ( [ cceq0 ] ) of an extremely large characteristic length @xmath86 , but with the same accuracy such solutions can be described by the korteweg  de vries equation with the first correction ( [ kdv ] ) ( whose integration is not much different from the kdv itself , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for @xmath86 it follows from @xcite that equations ( [ cceq0 ] ) and ( [ kdv ] ) are asymptotically equivalent , but the theory of the latter is much simpler and well developed .",
    "the camassa - holm model for shallow water waves does not represent the long - wave asymptotic .",
    "any solution of this model , which is not asymptotically close to a solution of the korteweg  de vries equation is an artefact of the model and irrelevant to the theory of shallow water waves . in the literature there are many papers with implicit criticism of various aspects of the derivation of the camassa - holm model and its validity as well as attempts to rectify them , but they only contribute further to the confusion .",
    "serious concerns about the asymptotic sense of the camassa - holm equation as a water wave theory has been raised in @xcite . in our paper we put an end to desperate attempts to justify the camassa - holm model using the long wave asymptotic theory .",
    "based on our consideration it is not difficult to conclude , that neither the camassa - holm model nor the degasperis - procesi equation ( @xcite ) can represent a long wave asymptotic in problems of hydrodynamic , physics of condensed matter , plasmas , etc , and that the peakon solutions are irrelevant for the long wave asymptotic theory .",
    "having said so , we do not want to undermine the mathematical value of equation ( [ cceq0 ] ) .",
    "it is a fine example of an integrable multi - hamiltonian system with interesting associated spectral theory , unusual properties , etc .",
    "it may have other applications due to the discovery by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that equation ( [ cceq0 ] ) is the euler equation for the geodesic flow on the virasoro group with respect to the right - invariant sobolev @xmath87 -metric . as a mathematical object ,",
    "the class of integrable equations discovered by fuchssteiner and fokas is a valuable contribution to the theory of differential equations .",
