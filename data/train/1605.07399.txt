    "there are two major facets of quantum information science : quantum computing @xcite and quantum communication @xcite . in the last three decades ,",
    "both of these have attracted major attraction of the scientific community for their ability to perform computational or communication tasks beyond the capacity of their classical counterparts .",
    "specifically , a quantum algorithm may perform a computational task much faster than its classical counterpart .",
    "for example , grover s algorithm @xcite can search unsorted database quadratically faster than its best known classical counterpart , and shor s algorithm @xcite can factorize large numbers in a speed not attainable in a classical computer . similarly , in the domain of quantum communication , protocols have been proposed for teleportation @xcite , which does not have any classical analogue , and unconditional security of quantum key distribution @xcite has been established @xcite . unconditional security is a desirable feat not achievable in classical world .",
    "the nonclassical nature of quantum communication schemes drew considerable attention of the scientific community .",
    "especially , teleportation ( a communication scheme , in which the state to be transmitted from the sender to the receiver never exists in the channel joining the receiver and the sender ) drew major attention because of its magical characteristics .",
    "initially , a teleportation scheme was proposed by bennett et al . in 1993",
    "@xcite . in the original teleportation scheme ,",
    "the sender alice used to transmit / teleport an unknown single - qubit quantum state to the receiver bob using a shared entangled state and two bits of classical communication .",
    "subsequently , several variants of teleportation have been proposed .",
    "for example , schemes were proposed for quantum information splitting ( qis ) or controlled teleportation ( ct ) @xcite , quantum secret sharing ( qss ) @xcite , hierarchical quantum information splitting ( hqis ) @xcite , remote state preparation ( rsp ) @xcite , etc .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "all these schemes can be viewed as variants of teleportation .",
    "recently , a few hierarchical versions of already existing aspects of quantum communication ( variants of teleportation ) have been proposed .",
    "specifically , hierarchical quantum information splitting ( hqis ) @xcite , hierarchical quantum secret sharing ( hqss ) @xcite , hierarchical dynamic quantum secret sharing ( hdqss ) @xcite , etc .",
    ", have been proposed in the recent past .",
    "it is also shown that these schemes have enormous practical importance ( for a detailed discussion on the interesting applications of these schemes see sec . 1 of refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in these protocols",
    ", there is a hierarchy among the powers of receivers ( agents ) to reconstruct a quantum state sent by the sender , i.e. , the agents are graded in accordance to their power for the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state .",
    "specifically , in hqis the receivers can reconstruct the teleported quantum state with the help of other receivers ( as in qis @xcite ) , where the power of a particular receiver is decided by the minimum number of receivers required to cooperate with him to enable him to reconstruct the state @xcite .",
    "in probabilistic hqis , the same task is performed probabilistically .",
    "hqss scheme can be viewed as a direct application of hqis where the sender wishes to send an information in pieces to all the receivers who can reconstruct it with the help of either some or all other agents .",
    "later the scheme was extended to propose a hdqss scheme , and in hdqss scheme an additional feature to add and drop an agent was included @xcite , and that made hdqss most practical hierarchical scheme proposed until now .",
    "this is so because , in a practical situation , an agent may resign from a company or take leave , and the company may decide to recruit a new agent as his / her replacement .",
    "further , if the sale of the company gets increased it may recruit a new agent .",
    "however , these recently introduced schemes of hierarchical quantum communication lags a particularly important feature . in all the existing schemes",
    ", there is only one sender , but in many practical purposes ( as illustrated with an example in sec .",
    "[ sec : practical - applications ] ) we need more than one sender for the secrecy of the initial message / state to be transmitted in ahierarchical manner . this paper aims to address this particular issue and design a new type of scheme for hierarchical quantum communication , which we would refer to as hierarchical joint remote state preparation ( hjrsp ) scheme in analogy with the well known joint remote state preparation ( jrsp ) schemes @xcite .    here , it would be apt to note that there exists a variant of teleportation known as rsp , where a known quantum state is remotely prepared at the receiver s end .",
    "thus , rsp may be viewed as teleportation of a known quantum state .",
    "the first rsp scheme was proposed by pati @xcite using bell states , in 2000 .",
    "this scheme required 1 bit of classical communication and a shared entangled state ( 1 ebit ) .",
    "as the standard teleportation scheme requires 2 cbit and 1 ebit , pati s scheme of rsp was able to teleport a known quantum state with reduced resources compared to the unknown qubit case .",
    "however , this scheme was probabilistic in nature , as the success probability was not unity . later a deterministic counterpart of the rsp scheme",
    "was proposed by an et al .",
    "@xcite , where the required resources become equal to that of teleportation @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a large amount of work has been carried out on rsp . in these works",
    "rsp has been implemented in probabilistic , deterministic , controlled and controlled bidirectional manner using different quantum states , such as @xmath2-level , 4-qubit @xmath3 state , multi - qubit @xmath3 state , 4-qubit cluster - type state , arbitrary two qubit state , and @xmath4 state @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a few experimental realizations of some of the rsp schemes have also been reported in the past @xcite .    in 2008 ,",
    "the rsp scheme was modified to a three - party scheme of the joint rsp ( jrsp ) @xcite .",
    "this one is a unique quantum communication scheme , where two senders jointly prepare a known quantum state at the remote port .",
    "the state to be prepared remotely is neither completely known to sender 1 nor to sender 2 , but they jointly know the state to be teleported .",
    "it is worth stressing that this scheme has no analogue in teleportation , as an unknown quantum state can not be teleported in this way by more than one sender . since then several schemes for jrsp",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "in fact , the jrsp @xcite scheme was investigated under the amplitude damping ( ad ) and phase damping ( pd ) noise models in the recent past .",
    "interestingly , practical applications of the hierarchical quantum communication schemes , described in the context of hqis @xcite and hdqss @xcite , motivated us to investigate the possibility of designing a hierarchical version of jrsp ( hjrsp ) scheme with the hope of using it in some of the practical purposes of daily life .",
    "further , recent investigations on rsp schemes @xcite under the noisy environment , such as ad and pd channels , motivated us to simulate a similar study for the proposed hjrsp protocol .",
    "the hqis scheme @xcite proposed in the recent past involves teleportation of an unknown quantum state among three receivers hierarchically .",
    "further , we know that in a jrsp scheme , there are two senders having the information of amplitude and relative phase , respectively .",
    "hence , the proposed hjrsp scheme should have at least five parties ( 2 senders and three receivers to ensure joint preparation and hierarchical reconstruction ) , and therefore , we need at least a 5-qubit quantum state for the implementation of the hjrsp protocol .",
    "this is why , we have used a 5-qubit cluster state of the form    @xmath5_{s_{1}s_{2}r_{1}r_{2}r_{3}}\\label{eq : state}\\ ] ]    with the qubits @xmath6 belonging to the senders @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; and @xmath9 and @xmath10 corresponding to the qubits of the three receivers , who are referred to as @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the preparation of the cluster state ( [ eq : state ] ) by @xmath7 and distribution of qubits to all other parties is illustrated through the schematic diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hjrsp - scheme ] . more detail of the scheme follows in the forthcoming section .",
    "hjrsp scheme illustrated through a schematic diagram .",
    "the quantum and classical communications involved between all the parties are shown using the smooth and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "it is shown that @xmath12 can reconstruct the quantum state with the help of only one of the lower power agents ( in the diagram it is shown as @xmath13 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath14 requires help of both @xmath13 and @xmath12 . here",
    ", we have not shown the case when @xmath13 reconstructs the quantum state as it is similar to the case when @xmath14 does so ]    .    in the following sections ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hierarchical - joint - remote ] , we propose a protocol of deterministic hjrsp using 5-qubit cluster state of the form ( [ eq : state ] ) .",
    "this is followed by a protocol of probabilistic hjrsp using a non - maximally entangled counterpart of the 5-qubit cluster state ( [ eq : state ] ) .",
    "subsequently , we have discussed some practical applications of the proposed hjrsp schemes in sec . [",
    "sec : practical - applications ] .",
    "further , in sec .",
    "[ sec : effect - of - set ] , we study the effect of a set of noise models on the proposed deterministic hjrsp scheme .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in a hjrsp scheme , we have two senders ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , such that @xmath15 knows the information about the amplitude , and @xmath16 has the phase information related to the qubit @xmath17 : @xmath18 .",
    "it implies that the senders jointly know the quantum state to be prepared at the remote location ( i.e. , at the receivers end ) , whereas it is unknown to the receivers .",
    "further , we require at least three receivers to design a hierarchical scheme for joint remote state preparation . here , the three receivers are referred to as @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the hierarchy among the receivers will be established in what follows . to accomplish the task ,",
    "we have chosen a 5-qubit cluster state of the form ( [ eq : state ] ) where each of the participants possesses one qubit of the 5-qubit cluster state .",
    "subsequently , a probabilistic version of hjrsp scheme is introduced , and it s shown that the probabilistic hjrsp scheme appears when we use a non - maximally entangled state of the form ( [ eq : state ] ) as a quantum channel .",
    "we may now describe a protocol of deterministic hjrsp using a quantum state of the form ( [ eq : state ] ) in following steps :    step  1 : :    @xmath22 prepares the 5-qubit cluster state    ( [ eq : state ] ) .",

    "shows that if we can obtain fidelity for the most general pauli channel described by ( [ eq : pauli - noise - model ] ) , we can obtain the fidelities for evolution under specific noise models as special cases of that . keeping this in mind ,",
    "we have obtained following analytic expressions for the average fidelity of the quantum state remotely prepared by the proposed hjrsp scheme when the quantum state to be prepared remotely is evolved under most general pauli noise model , and either @xmath20 or @xmath21 reconstructs the state : @xmath206    ( color online ) the average fidelity of the quantum state reconstructed by both the higher and lower power agents when subjected to pauli noise are shown .",
    "( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) correspond to bit - flip , bit - phase - flip , phase - flip and depolarizing channels , respectively .",
    "in all these plots , @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the smooth ( blue ) and dotted ( red ) lines correspond to the fidelities of the quantum states obtained by the higher power agent and the lower power agent , respectively . ]    to illustrate the effect of pauli noise , we have plotted the average fidelity ( @xmath207 ) under the pauli noise model for the state parameters @xmath175 and @xmath176 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pauli ] . here",
    ", we have used a depolarizing channel , where the total probability of error for bit , phase and bit - phase flip errors is @xmath208 , and consequently , @xmath209 is theprobability for each kind of error .",
    "specifically , in fig .",
    "[ fig : pauli ] ( a ) , the average fidelity @xmath207 is shown in case of bit - flip errors .",
    "it can be observed that the fidelities of the state obtained by @xmath20 and @xmath21 vary almost similarly and decay to the lowest value when the probability of errors @xmath210 is unity .",
    "similarly , in fig . [ fig : pauli ] ( b ) , the average fidelity of the state reconstructed by both higher and lower power agents in bit - phase - flip channel is shown .",
    "interestingly , it has been observed that for higher probability of errors , i.e. , @xmath211 , even higher power agent @xmath20 has less fidelity of the reconstructed state than that of the lower power agent .",
    "in fact , beyond this value of probability of errors a revival in the fidelity for the lower power agent can be seen . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pauli ] ( c ) , variation of the average fidelity @xmath207 with the probability of phase - flip error is illustrated .",
    "in contrast with fig . [",
    "fig : pauli ] ( b ) , here the fidelity obtained by the higher power agent is revived and reached to unity for maximum probability of error .",
    "further , the fidelity of the state obtained by the higher power agent is always higher than that of the lower power agent , which shows a gradual decay with increasing probability of error ( cf . red ( dashed ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pauli ] ( c ) ) . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : pauli ] ( d ) , we have plotted the average fidelity @xmath207 under the effect of depolarizing channel , where the fidelity of states obtained by both the receivers converges for @xmath212 , and after that it decays for the higher power agent .",
    "in the present paper we have introduced the notion of hjrsp and have proposed a protocol for deterministic hjrsp using 5-qubit cluster state of the form ( [ eq : state ] ) .",
    "the scheme is also illustrated through fig .",
    "[ fig : hjrsp - scheme ] .",
    "it is unique in nature because it allows joint preparability ( more than one sender ) , a feature which is desirable in practicalsituations as illustrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : practical - applications ] , but not present in any of the existing schemes of hierarchical quantum communication .",
    "further , in the present work , the effect of various noise models on the proposed hjrsp scheme has been investigated in detail .",
    "in contrast , in none of the existing proposals for hierarchical quantum communication , the effect of noise has been discussed . however , in a practical situation , it is impossible to circumvent the existence of noise .",
    "thus , the present study not only makes it more realistic , it also yields an extremely relevant and essential feature of hierarchical quantum communication .",
    "further , in addition to the deterministic hjrsp , a protocol for probabilistic hjrsp using a non - maximally entangled cluster state is also introduced here .",
    "usually , a reduction of required quantum resources is expected in probabilistic rsp .",
    "however , it was not obtained here due to use of a non - maximally entangled state .",
    "the study of the effect of different noise models has led to many interesting results . specifically , it is observed that the quantum state that the higher power agent and the lower power agent can reconstruct may get decohered due to interaction with its surroundings , which have been analyzed and discussed in detail in the previous section . in brief , the higher power agent can reconstruct the quantum state less affected due to ad and pd noise than that of the lower power agent .",
    "however , when the travel qubits are subjected to collective or pauli noise , lower power agent may also get better performance than that of the higher power agent .",
    "interestingly , a few specific quantum states can be remotely prepared in an unaffected manner , even in the presence of noise . here",
    ", we have restricted ourselves to markovian noise .",
    "the effect of non - markovian type of noise will be reported elsewhere .",
    "it would be interesting to study controlled versions of the hierarchical quantum communication protocols proposed here and in the recent past , as a variety of applications of the various controlled quantum communication protocols have been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "we expect that due to the wide applicability of the hierarchical schemes the proposed scheme may be of interest to experimentalists and in the near future the results reported here will be experimentally verified .",

    "<S> a novel scheme for quantum communication having substantial applications in practical life is designed and analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we have proposed a hierarchical counterpart of the joint remote state preparation ( jrsp ) protocol , where two senders can jointly and remotely prepare a quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> one sender has the information regarding amplitude , while the other one has the phase information of a quantum state to be jointly prepared at the receiver s port . </S>",
    "<S> however , there exists a hierarchy among the receivers , as far as powers to reconstruct the quantum state is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> a 5-qubit cluster state has been used here to perform the task . </S>",
    "<S> further , it is established that the proposed scheme for hierarchical jrsp ( hjrsp ) is of enormous practical importance in critical situations involving defense and other sectors , where it is essential to ensure that an important decision / order that can severely affect a society or an organization is not taken by a single person , and once the order is issued all the receivers do nt possess an equal right to implement it . </S>",
    "<S> further , the effect of different noise models ( e.g. , amplitude damping ( ad ) , phase damping ( pd ) , collective noise and pauli noise models ) on the hjrsp protocol proposed here is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in ad and pd noise models a higher power agent can reconstruct the quantum state to be remotely prepared with higher fidelity than that done by the lower power agent(s ) . in contrast , the opposite may happen in the presence of collective noise models . </S>",
    "<S> we have also proposed a scheme for probabilistic hjrsp using a non - maximally entangled 5-qubit cluster state .    </S>",
