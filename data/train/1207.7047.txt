    "determinantal hypersurfaces are a classical topic of complex algebraic geometry ( see beauville @xcite and dolgachev @xcite for a modern presentation ) . in 1902 , dixon  @xcite proved that every smooth projective plane curve admits a symmetric determinantal representation .",
    "hermitian and real symmetric representations of real curves were studied in generality only later by dubrovin @xcite and vinnikov @xcite .",
    "recently , questions in convex optimization ( semidefinite and hyperbolic programming ) and operator theory have been the motivation for more refined questions , especially concerning the definiteness of determinantal representations . if the polynomial @xmath0 has a definite determinantal representation @xmath16 with real symmetric matrices , then the real surface defined by @xmath0 bounds the _ spectrahedron _ @xmath17 this convex set is the cone over the region enclosed by the inner oval of the hyperbolic projective curve @xmath12 .",
    "this realizes the convex region as the feasible set of a semidefinite program , and we say that the region is represented by a _ linear matrix inequality_. in this context , the helton - vinnikov theorem @xcite says that the convex region of any hyperbolic plane curve can be represented by a linear matrix inequality .",
    "the search for a suitable higher - dimensional analogue of this theorem is still an intriguing open problem ; see vinnikov @xcite for an excellent review of both the history and recent progress on this problem and netzer and thom @xcite for further discussion .    in this paper",

    "the connection between the interlacing property and the definiteness of a hermitian matrix of linear forms is explored in section  [ sec : hermdets ] .",
    "we provide a topological characterization of the definiteness of such a matrix by the interlacing of its determinant and comaximal minors ( see theorem  [ thm : interlacedetrep ] ) .",
