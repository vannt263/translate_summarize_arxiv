    "optical nebulosities trace large cavities around early - type stars ( o , of and wolf - rayet , wr ) that are formed as the high - speed wind sweeps up ambient interstellar gas and compresses it into a thin shell . the flow pattern , resulting from this interaction ,",
    "was first recognized by pikelner ( 1968 ) and consists of two regions of shocked gas : one corresponding to the shocked stellar wind and the other to shocked interstellar gas .",
    "the two regions are separated by a contact discontinuity and the hot interior gas can cool via thermal conduction across the interface . because of its high temperature , the interior of the wind - blown bubbles ( wbb ) is expected to emit in x - rays .    in 1970",
    "s and 1980 s , analytical solutions for the wbb structure were derived that revealed details in the physics of these interesting objects . for a review of the analytical works and the related physical ideas",
    "see dyson ( 1981 ) and mccray ( 1983 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the most complete ( semi-)analytical study of the wbb structure was presented in weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) . with the increasing computing power ,",
    "the numerical hydrodynamic simulations became a powerful tool for studying the physics of these objects .",
    "the first numerical modeling of wbb was done by @xcite and later on details of the adiabatic , radiative and conductive wbb were studied numerically ( e.g. , @xcite ; rozyczka & tenorio - tagle , 1985a , b , c ; brighenti & dercole , 1995a , b , 1997 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2000 ) . thanks to numerical simulations , it was found that the wbb are subject to numerous dynamic instabilities .",
    "these simulations also allowed a much more complete and complex physical picture be explored , namely , by following various phases of the wbb evolution when the wind of the central stars varies with time ( for details see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observational properties of the optical nebula in wbb were described in detail in the early works of chu et al .",
    "( 1983 and the references therein ) and lozinskaya ( 1982 ; see also the book by lozinskaya 1993 for an observational review ) .",
    "but , it should be emphasized that the physics of the hot interior ( hot bubble ) of a wind - blown bubble is a cornerstone in the entire physical picture of these objects .",
    "this is so since the hot bubble is the region where the stellar wind energy is stored and subsequently used for driving the entire structure .",
    "from such a point of view , x - ray observations of wbb are very important because they can provide us with details about the physical conditions in the hot bubble .",
    "the first successful x - ray detection of a wbb was that of ngc  6888  by _ einstein _ @xcite .",
    "it was found that the x - ray emission from ngc 6888 is characterized by a plasma temperature kt @xmath3  kev ( 90% confidence interval ) , or t @xmath4  mk .",
    "_ rosat _ observations were sensitive to cooler plasma and yielded a characteristic temperature t @xmath5  mk .",
    "they showed that the x - ray emission arises primarily in filament like structures @xcite .",
    "_ asca _ observations suggested that even hotter plasma at t @xmath6  mk might be present in the bubble interior @xcite .",
    "preliminary results from a recent chandra observation , _ which covered only the northeast part _ of ngc  6888 , detected plasma with a temperature of t @xmath7  mk and possible nitrogen enrichment @xcite .",
    "similar soft x - ray spectra were detected for another wbb , s308 , with _",
    "rosat _ @xcite and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", none of these data provided us with solid grounds to draw a firm conclusion about the physical mechanism responsible for the x - ray emission from wbb . obviously , the x - ray emitting plasma in the hot bubble has a moderate temperature ( considerably lower than the one expected from a shock with velocity equal to that of the stellar wind ) and the reason for this could be that the thermal conduction operates efficiently in the hot interior .",
    "but , it is necessary to have solid observational arguments that support or rule out such a theoretical expectation .",
    "this was the basic motivation for the recent _ suzaku _ observations of ngc  6888  which covered the entire object and provided us with the x - ray spectra having good photon statistics .",
    "we report here the results from our analysis of these data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give some basic information about the wbb ngc  6888  in section [ sec : thebubble ] . in section [ sec : observations ] , we briefly review the _ suzaku _ observations . in section [ sec : global ]",

    "the nebula ngc  6888  around the wolf - rayet star wr 136 is the prototype of a broad class of ring nebulae around stars with strong stellar winds .",

    "the distance to ngc  6888  ( wr 136 ) is d  @xmath10  kpc @xcite , thus , the dynamical age of the object is 30,000 years . the observed x - ray flux in the _ rosat _ pspc band is @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath9 with an x - ray absorption column density of @xmath13 @xmath12 @xcite . a larger flux value of @xmath14 erg @xmath12 s@xmath9 is obtained from the _ acsa _ observations of this object @xcite .",

    "ngc  6888  was observed with _",
    "suzaku _ in two runs : june 4 and november 16 , 2009 , centered on the north - east and south - west parts of this object thus covering the entire optical nebula .",

    "see the _ suzaku _ data reduction guide : http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/suzaku/analysis/abc/ ] we extracted x - ray spectra of ngc  6888  from the filtered and screened pipeline events files using the @xmath22 and @xmath23 observational modes in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 editing modes , all the pulse heights of the corresponding 9 and 25 pixels centered at the event center are sent to the telemetry .",

    "we note that source no.5 is in fact the central star ( wr 136 ) in the nebula .",
    "since it is not a strong x - ray source @xcite , the presence of a near by point source ( no.6 ) and the large psf of _ suzaku _ telescopes prevents extraction of valuable information on its x - ray emission . despite the large ` pixel ' of _ suzaku _ images ,",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows that the x - rays of ngc  6888  originate from region _ inside _ the optical nebula and their spatial distribution is _ not _ uniform ( e.g. , indicating clump like structures ) .",

    "we made use of standard as well as custom models in version 11.3.2 of xspec @xcite for the spectral analysis in this study .",
    "finally , to facilitate comparisons of the new results on ngc  6888  with those from the previous x - ray observations of this object , we mention a few basic characteristics of the _ suzaku _ observations and similarly for those of _",

    "a general property of the _ suzaku _ spectra of ngc  6888   is that they are rather soft and no apparent line features are detected at photon energies @xmath31  kev .",
    "hence , we started our analysis with the x - ray spectra in the ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) range ( re - binned to have a minimum 100 counts per bin ) where most of the x - ray counts ( @xmath32% ) are found .",
    "we adopted the following approach .",
    "we used canonical discrete - temperature plasma models to derive the global properties of the x - ray emitting plasma in the hot bubble of ngc  6888 .",
    "since the ionization history of the plasma in the hot bubble is very complex and not well constrained , we considered two limiting cases : models that assume plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) or plasma with non - equilibrium ionization ( nie ) . for consistency in the atomic data , we made use of emission models _ vapec _ and _ vpshock _ in xspec .",
    "as a first step , we fitted the total spectra of the north - east ( combined region 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) and south - west ( combined region 3 and 4 in fig .  [ fig : images ] ) halves simultaneously ( four spectra in total ) .",
    "although the quality of the _ suzaku _ spectra is much better compared to that of the previous studies of the entire object , using _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we do not find it sufficient to allow us investigate possible variations of the x - ray absorption or abundances .",
    "thus , we assumed uniform abundances for the hot plasma in ngc  6888  and its x - ray emission is subject to the same interstellar absorption . these were free parameters in our fits .",
    "as a basic set of abundances , we adopted the solar abundances of @xcite .",
    "we varied only the n , o , ne , mg and fe abundances in the spectral fits since these are the elements that provide most of the x - rays in the ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) energy range . we also explored a different set of ( non - solar ) abundances ( @xcite ; see below ) that is typical for the stellar wind of the central wn6 star , since this star is the energy source for the hot bubble in ngc  6888 .",
    "the results from the global model fits to the entire x - ray spectrum of ngc  6888 , assuming uniform plasma temperature , are given in table  [ tab : fits ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we note the good quality of the fits and the fact that these fits confirm the early finding that the x - ray plasma in ngc  6888  is relatively ` cool ' ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the value of the x - ray absorption is slightly smaller than the one found from the analysis of the entire x - ray spectrum using _ rosat _ and _ asca _",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) while the observed flux in the _ suazku _ spectra of ngc  6888  is by 10 - 20% higher . a possible reason for this could be the quality of the spectra and we note that the total number of counts of the _ suzaku _ spectra was at least one order of magnitude larger than that in the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ spectra of ngc  6888 .",
    "thus , we believe that the results from the current analysis are better constrained",
    ". for comparison , figure  [ fig : spectra ] also shows the background spectra after subtracting the non x - ray background , nxb ( the nxb spectra were constructed following the procedure in the _ suzaku _ data reduction guide , see footnote [ foot:1 ] in   [ sec : observations ] ) .",
    "we see that the source and background spectra are very different ( e.g. , no n vii emission in the latter ) .",
    "this makes us confident about the derived results , despite the large ` pixel ' of the _ suzaku _ telescopes and the close location of the source and background subtraction regions .    as a next step",
    ", we searched for temperature variations of the x - ray plasma in the hot bubble of ngc  6888 .",
    "for this goal , we used 1 t _ vpshock _ model to fit the individual spectra of region 1 and 2 in the north - east and of region 3 and 4 in the south - west halves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) simultaneously ( eight spectra in total ) .",
    "all the spectra shared the same abundances and x - ray absorption .",
    "we note that the derived x - ray absorption ( n@xmath33 @xmath12 ) and abundances are consistent ( being within @xmath34 errors ) with their values from the spectral model fits with uniform plasma temperature and there is no appreciable variation in the plasma temperature within the hot bubble : kt@xmath35 ( region 1 ) ; @xmath36 ( region 2 ) ; @xmath37 ( region 3 ) ; @xmath38 ( region 4 ) ; that is all the values are within the @xmath34 errors from each other . the same is valid for the observed fluxes in the ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) energy range : f@xmath39 ergs @xmath12 s@xmath9 for region 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the observed spectra overlaid with the best - fit 1 t shock model ( @xmath40 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_quart ] .",
    "although the x - ray emission of ngc  6888  originates mostly from a non - uniform distribution of hot plasma ( filaments , clumps ; see @xcite ; @xcite ; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) , the properties of the x - ray emitting gas ( temperature , flux ) are quite uniform through the entire hot bubble .",
    "so , the high signal - to - noise _ suzaku _ data confirm similar findings already reported from the analysis of the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ observations of ngc  6888  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "but , we caution that the almost equal values for the observed flux from regions 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 do not mean that the plasma emissivity in the hot bubble is uniform . as seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : images ] , regions 1 and 4 comprise much smaller part from the nebula than regions 2 and 3 do . therefore , the plasma emissivity ( or emission measure ) of the x - ray emitting plasma is higher in regions 1 and 4 , likely due to higher plasma density or higher concentration of clumps and filaments .",
    "it is interesting to note that although we used simple plasma models to fit the observed x - ray spectra of ngc  6888 , the derived abundances are fairly consistent between different models , and they are generally _ inconsistent _ with the typical abundances of a wn star ( see below ) .",
    "in addition to the two basic models ( 2 t _ vapec _ and _ vpshock _ ) used to fit the entire spectrum of ngc  6888  , we ran some more complex ones : ( i ) a model with a distribution of thermal cie plasma ( we adopted our custom model which is similar to _ c6pvmkl _ in xspec but uses the",
    "collisional plasma for the x - ray spectrum at a given temperature ) ; ( ii ) a model with a distribution of adiabatic shocks with nie effects taken into account ( we made use of our custom model for xspec which was successfully used in the analysis of the x - ray spectra of snr  1987a - e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we will discuss the result from these more complex models below ( see   [ subsec : hotplasma ] ) , and we only mention that the models with a distribution of cie plasma or nie shocks show two peaks in the distribution of their emission measure with temperature : one for a ` cool ' plasma ( kt @xmath41 kev ) that dominates the x - ray emission from ngc  6888  and another for a ` hot ' plasma ( kt @xmath42 kev ) .",
    "the values for the plasma temperature of the 2 t _ vapec _ model are consistent with the values of the temperature peaks in the distribution of the cie plasma .    for comparison , we also ran a _ vpshock",
    "_ model with a set of typical wn abundances @xcite .",
    "we note that there was no good fit to the observed spectra unless we varied the abundances of n , o , ne , mg , and fe .",
    "figure  [ fig : abund ] presents the derived abundances from various model fits to the entire x - ray spectrum of ngc  6888 .",
    "all abundances are given with respect to the total number density of hydrogen and helium ( h@xmath24he ) which facilitates the comparison between cases with completely different basic set of abundances ( e.g. solar vs. non - solar ) .",
    "on the one hand , this result illustrates the uncertainties of the derived abundances if using different plasma models and , on the other hand , it conclusively demonstrates that the chemical composition of the x - ray emitting plasma in ngc  6888  is quite different from that of the stellar wind of the central star in this object .      in order to search for indications of x - ray emission from hot plasma ( kt @xmath42  kev )",
    ", we expanded the photon range of interest and considered the x - ray spectra of ngc  6888  in the ( 0.3 - 4.0 kev ) energy range .",
    "this increased the total number of source photons by @xmath43% compared to the ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) spectra analyzed above . to improve the photon statistics , we re - binned the spectra to have a minimum of 200 counts per bin .",
    "we used two models to fit the spectra : ( i ) one with a distribution of cie plasma ; ( ii ) and a model with a distribution of nei shocks ( as described in   [ subsec : soft ] ) .",
    "the quality of the fits was very good : @xmath44 ( cie plasma ) and @xmath45 ( nei shocks ) .",
    "the derived values for the x - ray absorption and chemical abundances were entirely consistent with the values discussed in our analysis of the soft ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra_hot ] shows the ngc  6888  spectra overlaid with the best - fit model for a distribution of cie plasma as well as the derived distribution of emission measure for the cie plasma and nei shocks .",
    "we see that both models show a bi - modal distribution of the x - ray emitting plasma with peaks quite distinguished in the temperature space .",
    "the ` cool ' plasma ( kt  @xmath46  kev ) is the dominant source of x - ray emission in the ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) energy range but provides only between ( 6 - 19)% of the flux at higher energies ( 1.5 - 4.0 kev ) , depending on the model used ( e.g. , cie plasma or nie shocks ) .",
    "it is thus quite likely that some hot plasma is present in the x - ray emitting region of ngc  6888 .",
    "this plasma is needed to explain the weak but statistically significant emission ( signal - to - noise  @xmath47 ) in the ( 1.5 - 4.0 kev ) energy range which may have been missed in the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ spectra of the entire wbb due to their considerably poorer photon statistics , and almost no sensitivity at energies @xmath42  kev for _",
    "the two most important results from the model fits to the x - ray spectra of ngc  6888  that could be directly related to the origin of the hot gas in this object are : ( i ) the x - ray plasma in ngc  6888  has a relatively low temperature ; ( ii ) the hot bubble abundances are not consistent with the ones of the stellar wind of the central star in ngc  6888  ( see   [ sec : global ] ) .",
    "the latter is justified in two ways as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : abund ] . the x - ray abundances are smaller than the corresponding canonical wn values ( typical for the central star ) by ( 0.5 - 1.5 ) dex on the average . and , the n / o ratio derived from the analysis of the _ suzaku _ data has a characteristic value of 2.0 - 3.0 which is much lower than the value of @xmath48 for the n / o ratio in the wn abundances set ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that low values ( @xmath25 ) for the n / o ratio were derived from analysis of the optical emission of ngc  6888 . also , the n , o and ne abundances derived from x - rays are very similar to those reported from the optical ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also fig .  [",
    "fig : abund ] ) .",
    "it is thus natural to conclude that the plasma which dominates the x - ray emission from ngc  6888  likely originates from the cold optical nebula .",
    "subsequently , this cold plasma has been heated to high temperatures through a mechanism that is yet to be identified .",
    "this heating mechanism must be capable of explaining the relatively low plasma temperature in the hot bubble of ngc  6888  ( kt @xmath49  kev ; see   [ sec : global ] ) .",
    "as proposed by the standard wbb model ( @xcite ; for numerical modeling see @xcite ) , the electron thermal conduction is such a physical mechanism .",
    "alternatively , the models of so called mass - loaded astronomical flows also suggest a relatively low temperature in the wbb objects ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) but we note that it is not well established which is the actual physical mechanism that is responsible for the ` instantaneous ' mixing of the hot bubble gas with the mass - loaded flow . in either case",
    "some important questions must find their answers in order to build a more complete global picture of ngc  6888 .",
    "namely , what is the fate of the shocked stellar wind ? given the age of this wbb (   [ sec : thebubble ] ) , we note that the massive wn wind can supply up to one solar mass or so of hot gas with distinct non - solar abundances .",
    "how can we explain that we find no indications for such a plasma in the x - ray spectrum of ngc  6888 ? and , how can the presence of really high - temperature plasma ( kt  @xmath42  kev ) fit into a general physical picture for wbb ? below , we will discuss these issues in some extent .",
    "in order to have a realistic view on the fate of the shocked wn stellar wind , we need to carry a direct comparison between the theoretical x - ray emission and the observed spectra of ngc  6888 . for this goal , we adopted the following procedure .",
    "first , we used a 1d numerical hydrodynamic model to derive the distribution of plasma characteristics ( temperature , density ) in the hot bubble . in turn",
    ", we constructed the hot plasma distribution of emission measure with temperature .",
    "second , we developed a custom model for xspec that uses thus derived distribution of emission measure to model the x - ray emission from ngc  6888 .",
    "finally , we used this model to fit the _ suzaku _ spectra and check the consistency of the physical model with observations : e.g. , whether the model provides correct observed flux , abundances , x - ray absorption .",
    "we briefly review some details about the wbb hydrodynamics ( see @xcite and numerical modeling in @xcite ) .",
    "when a massive stellar wind interacts with the circumstellar matter , csm , a two - slab structure will form , bounded by two shocks and a contact discontinuity separating the shocked csm gas from the shocked stellar wind . during the evolution of this structure",
    ", its outer part will collapse due to the energy losses by emission and will appear as optical nebula .",
    "on the other hand , its inner part is not subject to significant energy losses due to its high temperature and low density but its structure will depend on the efficiency of the electron thermal conduction . in the case",
    "the thermal conduction is suppressed ( e.g. , due to presence of magnetic field ) , the hot bubble will remain adiabatic and it will contain only the very hot gas of the shocked stellar wind . alternatively , the efficient thermal conduction will heat up part of the cold optical nebula which will expand inward ( the contact discontinuity will move towards the inner shock ) . as a result ,",
    "the plasma temperature in the hot bubble will decrease and its mass will increase . in this case",
    "the hot bubble will consist of two parts both filled with hot gas but with different chemical composition .    to derive the physical parameters of the hot bubble in ngc  6888",
    ", we used the 1d hydrodynamic code of a.v .",
    "myasnikov that was developed for modeling the physics of a standard wbb ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "this code allows modeling not only of adiabatic and radiative wbb but also of the case with efficient thermal conduction .",
    "it correctly handles interacting gas flows with different chemical compositions .",
    "we adopted the following basic set of parameters that determine the physics of a wbb : ( i ) @xmath50  m@xmath17  yr@xmath9  and @xmath51  km s@xmath9   for the stellar wind of the central star in ngc  6888  ( see   [ sec : thebubble ] ) ; ( ii ) @xmath52  m@xmath17  yr@xmath9  and @xmath53  km s@xmath9  for the slow wind that has been emitted in the previous evolutionary stage of the central star .",
    "the interaction of such winds results in a wbb with a radius of @xmath54  pc at age of 30,000 years .",
    "we note that the size of the optical nebula ngc  6888  is @xmath8 ( @xcite ; also see fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) .",
    "thus , a spherically - symmetric ( 1d ) bubble with a radius of @xmath55  pc has the same volume as a prolate ellipsoid with major and minor axes equal to those of the optical nebula for the adopted distance to this object ( @xmath56 kpc ,   [ sec : thebubble ] ) . with this approximation",
    ", we calculate the distribution of emission measure of the hot bubble and the corresponding normalization parameter for the model spectrum in xspec ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "then , the actual spectral fit to the x - ray spectra can tell us if the theoretical emission measure gives the correct value for the observed flux from ngc  6888 .",
    "we fitted the total spectra of ngc  6888  with the theoretical x - ray emission for the case of conductive wbb having the basic set of physical parameters . in all model",
    "fits using results from our hydrodynamic simulations , the abundances of the shocked stellar wind had values fixed to the typical wn abundances @xcite and only abundances of the ` evaporated ' gas from the cold shell were allowed to vary .",
    "we note that using the basic set of parameters provided acceptable fit to the shape of the observed spectra but it grossly overestimated the observed flux ( by a factor of @xmath58 ) . to reconcile this flux discrepancy",
    ", it was necessary to reduce the amount of x - ray emitting plasma in the hot bubble .",
    "we ran a series of hydrodynamic simulations by simultaneously reducing the mass - loss rates of the central star in ngc  6888  and of the previously emitted slow wind which results in no change of the global geometry of the shock structure .",
    "in all these simulations , the wind velocities had their values as in the basic set of physical parameters ( see above ) .",
    "the case with a reduction factor of @xmath59 for the mass - loss rates provided the correct observed flux and the derived abundances were a factor of ( 3 - 5 ) higher than the values in fig .",
    "[ fig : abund ] . the corresponding spectral fit ( @xmath60 ) to the _ suzaku _ spectra of ngc  6888",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_wbb ] .",
    "it is worth noting that although the required reduction for the mass - loss rates might seem considerable , we find additional evidence that this could well be the case .",
    "if we assume that the thermal conduction is not efficient and some other mechanism is responsible for the relatively low plasma temperature deduced from the analysis of the x - ray emission from ngc  6888  (   [ sec : global ] ) , the hot bubble in this object will then be purely adiabatic .",
    "we ran a series of 1d hydrodynamic models for this case starting with the same set of basic physical parameters as described above .",
    "the result was that the shocked stellar wn wind plasma had too high a temperature and the models provided strong x - ray flux at energies @xmath61  kev considerably exceeding the one observed . for graphical clarity ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_wbb ] the theoretical spectrum of purely adiabatic wbb with mass - loss rates reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "note that the normalization ( or the flux ) of the theoretical spectrum scales with the mass - loss rate as @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , it is conclusive that independently from which is the heating mechanism for the x - ray emitting plasma in ngc  6888 , we find indications that the mass - loss rate of the central star should be smaller than the value of @xmath63  m@xmath17  yr@xmath9  adopted here . direct comparisons of the model predictions and the x - ray observations suggests a reduction factor of @xmath64 .      a general physical picture of the x - ray emission from a wbb must provide a reasonable explanation about the origin of the x - ray emitting gas and the mechanism that heats it up to the observed temperatures .",
    "thus , we recall the basic properties of the x - rays from ngc  6888 .    the previous observations of the entire wbb with _ rosat _ and _ asca _ found that the x - ray emission of ngc  6888  comes from clump - like structures ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is also the case as seen in the high signal - to - noise _ suzaku _ data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) .",
    "our analysis of the _ suzaku _ spectra of ngc  6888  showed that most of the x - rays come from relatively cool plasma ( kt @xmath1  kev ) but there is also some very hot plasma ( kt @xmath42  kev ; fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_hot ] ) that is responsible for the observed emission in the ( 1.5 - 4.0 kev ) energy region .",
    "the physical picture that emerges from the analysis of the x - ray data of ngc  6888  is then the following .",
    "most of the soft x - rays come from clumps distributed in the hot bubble of this object . as indicated by the similar chemical composition of the x - ray emitting plasma and the optical shell ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : abund ] ) , these clumps likely originate from the cold but ionized optical nebula .",
    "most probably they were formed through various dynamic instabilities the optical nebula was subject to during its evolution ( e.g. see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and multiple shock waves may have contributed in the case of conductive wbb , @xcite ) . in addition , there is some very hot plasma that can be associated with the shocked wn wind of the central star .",
    "the details of this general physical picture depend on the heating mechanism that operates in the hot bubble of ngc  6888 .",
    "_ conductive wbb .",
    "_ if the electron thermal conduction is efficient , the energy of the shocked stellar wind will be dissipated , part of the outer shell will ` evaporate ' and this will form a smooth component of relatively hot plasma filling in the inner part of the nebula .",
    "this case is well represented by the hydrodynamic model of wbb with thermal conduction and this model gave an acceptable fit ( @xmath60 ) to the observed spectra ( see   [ subsec : hydro ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_wbb ] ) . in this picture ,",
    "the dense ionized clumps that were formed via dynamic instabilities are engulfed by the hot bubble and heated up to x - ray temperatures thanks to the efficient thermal conduction .",
    "in fact , when we added an extra component ( using model",
    "_ vapec _ in xspec ) to the spectral fit based on the hydrodynamic simulations , the spectral model matched better the observed spectra ( @xmath65 ) and the derived abundances had values consistent with those in fig .",
    "[ fig : abund ] .",
    "the derived plasma temperature for this additional component ( the clumps ) was kt  @xmath66  kev .",
    "the main problem in the case of conductive wbb is that there can not exist in the hot bubble plasma with temperatures as high as those derived from the fits to the _ suzaku _ spectra in the ( 0.3 - 4.0 kev ) energy range (   [ subsec : hotplasma ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_hot ] ) . as a result ,",
    "practically no photons are produced in the ( 1.5 - 4.0 kev ) energy band contrary to what is observed (   [ subsec : hotplasma ] ) .",
    "we recall that _ asymmetric _ thermal conduction @xcite might be a remedy to this problem if a global ordered magnetic field is present in ngc  6888 .",
    "thus , there might be a small part in the hot bubble with a very hot plasma while the rest of it will be filled in with much cooler plasma .",
    "unfortunately , the number of detected photons in the ( 1.5 - 4.0 kev ) energy band did not allow us to study their spatial distribution and much deeper observations are needed for that purpose .",
    "_ adiabatic wbb .",
    "_ if the electron thermal conduction is suppressed due to the presence of magnetic field , the hot bubble will be adiabatic and the dense clumps that originate from the cold outer shell and penetrate the bubble interior are heated up to x - ray temperatures through some mechanism different from thermal conduction .",
    "we explored quantitatively this case by considering a spectral model consisting of two components : one representing the emission from the adiabatic hot bubble ( from our hydrodynamic simulations ) and another one ( using model _",
    "vapec _ in xspec ) representing the x - ray emission of the dense clumps .",
    "we obtained a good fit ( @xmath67 ) to the _ suzaku _ spectra of ngc  6888  in the case of reduced by a factor of 3 mass - loss rates .",
    "the temperature of the dense clumps was kt  @xmath66  kev and the derived abundances were consistent with those in fig .",
    "[ fig : abund ] .",
    "then , what is the mechanism that heats up the dense clumps ? given the chemical composition of the clumps ( or the cold nebula ) , shocks with velocity @xmath68  km s@xmath9  can provide the required temperature ( kt  @xmath66  kev ) .",
    "but , simple considerations show that the rarefied plasma in the hot bubble does not have the necessary power to run such shocks into a gas with much higher density than the hot plasma itself ( e.g. , given the stellar wind velocity of 1600  km s@xmath9  , the expected relative velocity between the hot plasma and the clumps is maximum of the order of the velocity of the shock ) .",
    "could it be that the dense clumps mix _ locally _ with the hot plasma and since the electron thermal conduction is inefficient , the energy exchange occurs directly between the heavy particles ( ions ) of the two components ?",
    "consequently , the electrons in the mixture are heated as well .",
    "also , the relative velocity between the hot plasma and the clumps will favor such a diffusion of the heavy particles .",
    "we note that the adiabatic wbb does not have the high - temperature caveat of the conductive wbb mentioned above .",
    "but , how can we distinguish between the two cases , conductive or adiabatic wbb ?",
    "we think that there might be some observational differences resulting from these two heating mechanisms .",
    "the electron thermal conduction is a very efficient dissipative mechanism , thus the heating of the cold gas of the clumps will occur almost instantaneously. on the other hand , the ion - ion energy exchange ( thanks to diffusion of the hot ions into the cold gas ) is much slower process .",
    "we recall that this different efficiency is due to the much faster energy exchange between the light particles ( the characteristic time is proportional to the square root of the particle s mass ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we may expect that there will exist clumps in the hot bubble that have temperature intermediate between that of the optical outer shell and the x - ray clumps .",
    "these clumps will be source of uv emission .",
    "therefore , if spectral observations of ngc  6888  detect strong lines in the 1,000 - 2,000    spectral range ( e.g. , of ` hot ' ions like nv , ovi ) , this will indicate that the thermal conduction is considerably suppressed in this object .",
    "alternatively , if clumps with no strong uv emission are detected , this will favor the thermal conduction as the heating mechanism in ngc  6888 .",
    "another observational possibility also exists , although it is not quite feasible for the moment .",
    "@xcite reported a narrow radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) in the x - ray spectrum of the planetary nebula bd@xmath69 .",
    "they interpret this rrc emission feature as result when bare c vii ions penetrating from the hot bubble into the cold optical nebula recombine with cool electrons .",
    "in general , the same can be expected when the hot ions diffuse into the cold clumps as proposed above and rrc of various ions can be expected .",
    "but , a crucial experiment for distinguishing between detection from non - detection of these rrc features must wait for future observations with the next generation of x - ray telescopes since such an experiment requires high spectral resolution x - ray observations which are not feasible for ngc  6888  at the moment .",
    "all this , as well as the suggested reduction for the mass - loss rate of the central wn star , emphasizes the importance to carry out some global analysis of the entire system ngc  6888 : central star , optical and x - ray nebula ( hot bubble ) .",
    "namely , a self - consistent modeling of the optical - uv emission of the central star ( wr 136 ) and the optical nebula and confronting it with observations can provide us with a valuable piece of information about the wind velocity and mass loss , temperature distribution in the stellar wind , its abundances as well as the density and abundances of the optical nebula .",
    "this will put much tighter constraints on the physical parameters determining the physical conditions in the hot bubble ( and its x - ray emission ) . in turn",
    ", it will result in a better constrained general physical picture of the whole system .",
    "a suitable example of adopting such a global approach in the analysis of the optical - uv emission of a complex system is given in @xcite for the case of the planetary nebula ngc  6543 .",
    "the ionization history of the plasma in the hot bubble of a wbb is quite complex .",
    "consider the standard wbb model . in this case , the thermal conduction is efficient and we have two parts in the hot bubble filled correspondingly with the shocked stellar wind and the evaporated gas from the cold optical nebula . during the evolution of the wbb ,",
    "the temperature in the hot bubble decreases with time as well as does its density .",
    "thus , each new parcel of gas , crossing the inner shock or evaporating from the cold nebula , will have its own ionization history .",
    "this will depend on the time that parcel of gas entered the hot bubble , that is on the physical parameters of the hot plasma and their subsequent evolution until the moment of observations .",
    "we note that it is likely ( although it depends on the physical parameters for each studied object ) that the plasma on both sides in vicinity of the contact discontinuity will be almost in cie while that close to the inner shock or to the outer boundary in cold nebula will be in state of nei . in purely adiabatic wbb ,",
    "the ionization history of the plasma is similar but then the hot bubble contains only the shocked stellar wind .",
    "this picture becomes even more complicated in objects like ngc  6888  where the x - ray emission is not spatially uniform which indicates a presence of clump like structures .",
    "unfortunately , it is not feasible to follow the ionization history of the plasma in the hot bubble in the theoretical models or to deduce valuable information about it from the x - ray observations .",
    "the latter is particularly valid for the case of ccd x - ray spectra .",
    "for that reason , our approach in this study was to consider two limiting cases : plasma models with cie and models that , although in a simplified but well defined manner , take into account the nei effects .",
    "such an approach illustrates better the uncertainties in the derived properties ( e.g. , temperature , abundances , emission measure ) of the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "in this work , we presented an analysis of the _ suzaku _ data on ngc  6888 : the wind - blown bubble around the wolf - rayet star wr 136 .",
    "for the first time , x - ray spectra of the entire nebula are obtained that have a very good quality allowing a detailed comparison between theory and observations .",
    "the basic results and conclusions are as follows .    1 .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the wbb ngc  6888  are soft and most of the emission is in the ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) energy range although some emission ( @xmath43% of the observed flux ) is found at higher energies ( 1.5 - 4.0 kev ) .",
    "the spectral fits require a relatively cool plasma with kt  @xmath1  kev but much hotter plasma with temperature kt  @xmath2  kev is needed to match the observed hard x - ray emission .",
    "we find no appreciable temperature variations within the hot bubble of ngc  6888 . 2 .",
    "one of the important results from the spectral fits is that the derived abundances ( n , o , ne ) are very much the same as those of the optical nebula . also , they are considerably different from the wn abundances @xcite assumed ` typical ' for the wind of the central star in the nebula .",
    "this indicates a common origin of the x - ray emitting gas and the outer cold shell , that is most of the x - ray plasma ( likely concentrated in clumps as the x - ray images indicate ) has flown into the hot bubble from the optical nebula .",
    "3 .   a direct comparison ( in xspec ) between 1d hydrodynamic models and the x - ray spectra of ngc",
    "6888  suggests a reduced mass - loss rate ( @xmath70  m@xmath17  yr@xmath9  ) of the central star in order to provide the correct value of the observed flux .",
    "we note that this figure is appreciably low for wolf - rayet stars and thus emphasizes the need of a global modeling of the entire system : central star , optical nebula and the hot bubble .",
    "the general physical picture that emerges from the current analysis is the following .",
    "most of the x - rays come from clumps distributed in the hot bubble of ngc  6888 .",
    "these clumps originate from the cold optical nebula and they formed through various dynamic instabilities during the evolution of the wind - blown bubble .",
    "the shocked wn wind of the central star is likely the source of the very hot plasma ( kt  @xmath71  kev ) in this wind - blown bubble .",
    "if the electron thermal conduction is efficient , this can naturally explain the relatively low plasma temperature of most of the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "alternatively , the hot bubble in ngc  6888  will be adiabatic and the cold clumps are heated up to x - ray temperatures likely by energy exchange between the heavy particles ( e.g. , a local diffusion of the rarefied hot plasma into the dense clumps ) .",
