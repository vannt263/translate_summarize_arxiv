    "@xcite it is proved that equation ( [ gl ] ) is uniquely solvable for @xmath15 and the elements of @xmath12 are isolated points .",
    "therefore the continuous solution of equation ( [ gl ] ) ( if it exists ) is unique .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that @xmath16 is not integrable near @xmath17 therefore the potential @xmath18 corresponding to the schrdinger equation has poles of order ( at least ) 2 at these isolated points @xmath19 . such potentials are not in @xmath20 and we call them singular potentials",
    ".    to get non - singular potentials by the cox - thompson method is thus in an intimate connection with the uniqueness of solution of equation ( [ gl ] ) . from now on the treatment is restricted to the one - term limit , i.e. , to the case when @xmath21 .",
    "such a case represents a natural first step compared to the uniqueness solution of the ct method with finite number of phase shifts .",
    "also , the one phase shift case is closely related to the phenomenon of quantum resonance scattering ( when the resonance - like enhancement of the total cross section is mainly determined by a single partial wave ) or the ramsauer - townsend effect ( when the electron - atom interaction is governed mainly by the @xmath22-wave phase shift ) @xcite .    in the one - term limit , the numerator of equation ( [ determ ] ) becomes the wronskian @xmath23 to ensure a unique solution of the regge - newton integral equation ( [ gl ] ) , we shall establish a condition for @xmath24 .",
    "this is also the condition for constructing a non - singular potential @xmath25 at the one - term level @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 . in order to get a potential that belongs to the class @xmath20 we shall prove the next statement .    @xmath29 .",
    "first we prove that there exists @xmath30 such that @xmath31 if @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "then the different sign of the wronskian at the origin @xmath35>0 $ ] and at the infinity @xmath36 < 0 $ ] clearly signals the existence of at least one zero position @xmath19 for which @xmath37 because of the continuity of @xmath38 .    for the uncovered region of @xmath39 with @xmath40 we shall use the standard notation for the @xmath41th zeros @xmath42 of the bessel functions @xmath43",
    "let now @xmath44 .",
    "we term _ regular _ sequence of zeros if the following interlacing holds for the @xmath41th and @xmath45th zeros : @xmath46 it is a simple matter to see that the local extrema of @xmath38 within the interval @xmath47 possess the same sign in case of regular sequence interlacing .",
    "this is because at the extremum positions @xmath48 and @xmath49 of @xmath38 the wronskian simplifies to @xmath50 now , in case of any deviation from this regular sequence , e.g. , when an _ irregular _ sequence @xmath51 is first encountered at a particular @xmath52 , one gets different signs for the two consecutive extrema of the wronskian at @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "this assumes the appearance of a zero position of @xmath38 within the region @xmath55 . in summary , observing regular sequences of interlacing for all @xmath56 is equivalent to the absence of roots of @xmath38 . to see that in the considered region such deviation from the regular sequence interlacing happens we present the following argument",
    "let @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "for @xmath59 the first deviation from the regular sequence takes place at some @xmath60 .",
    "it is easy to see that by increasing @xmath61 to @xmath62 one can not get a regular sequence and the first deviation will occur at some @xmath63 .",
    "note that the case @xmath64 can be similarly treated .",
    "turning now to the most interesting domain of @xmath65 , we consider again the case @xmath44 and the regular sequence of zero interlacing , @xmath66 .",
    "as indicated above , its fulfillment ensures lack of root of the wronskian : @xmath67 . by noting that any @xmath41th zero of a bessel function is a strictly growing function of the order it is sufficient to prove that @xmath68 , holds for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the only unknown inequality here is that of @xmath71 . to prove its validity we use the known intermediate relation @xmath72",
    "therefore , proving @xmath73 will suffice . consider the known relation @xmath74 which means that @xmath75 and @xmath76 have the same sign at @xmath77 .",
    "now because of the interlacing property @xmath78 and the limit @xmath79 @xmath80 , this implies that the @xmath41th zero of @xmath81 precedes the @xmath45th zero of @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 which had to be proven .",
    "note that the case @xmath64 can be similarly treated .    in case of @xmath84 ,",
    "the cox - thompson inverse scattering scheme yields a potential of the class @xmath20 iff the condition @xmath85 holds .",
    "in the course of the proof we obtained the following result of its own right :    denoting the @xmath41th root of the bessel functions @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , respectively , by @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 then the following inequality is valid for @xmath92 : @xmath93 .",
    "this proposition adds two new inequality sequences to the known ones ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    "one can construct a potential that possesses one specified phase shift @xmath96 ( @xmath84 ) by using the inversion scheme of cox and thompson @xcite : @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 relation ( [ tan ] ) gives @xmath100 , @xmath101 . for @xmath102 $ ] the corollary results in the choice of @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , for any @xmath96 , there is only one , easily identifiable non - singular potential and an infinite number of singular potentials that the cox - thompson method can produce .",
    "for an example let us choose @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in this case equation ( [ tan ] ) yields",
    "@xmath106 , @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath107 ( @xmath103 ) is not permitted by the assumption @xmath11 , however in order to get a non - singular potential one may replace this @xmath107 by @xmath108 with @xmath109 . using equation ( [ keq ] )",
    "one gets at @xmath104 and @xmath110 @xmath111 since @xmath112 and @xmath113 are continuous in @xmath62 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 holds .",
    "thus @xmath116 for @xmath30 .",
    "this is the physical solution .",
    "( see fig . 1 . )     with @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . ]",
    "[ fig1 ]    now let @xmath104 and @xmath118 . by the corollary we can not get an integrable potential in this case because @xmath119 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown explicitly that equation ( [ gl ] ) is not uniquely solvable at some @xmath120 for this case . however , while ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that this fact makes the cox - thompson scheme useless , in this paper we have shown that in order to get an integrable potential , the choice @xmath118 is not permitted because the set @xmath12 is not empty . on the other hand , equation ( [ tan ] ) and the corollary",
    "provide a one - to - one correspondence between the phase shift and the @xmath62 parameter of the cox - thompson method at the one - term level .",
    "this correspondence has the property that the potential constructed from @xmath62 belongs to @xmath20 and possesses the specified phase shift .    in fig .",
    "2 we add examples of the construction of an unique potential in @xmath121 in the case of non - trivial phase shifts .",
    "subfigure fig .",
    "2a shows the potentials for zero angular momentum with @xmath122 corresponding to @xmath123 which is permitted by the corollary ( nonsingular case , full line ) and @xmath124 which violates the corollary ( one - singularity case , dotted line ) .",

    "2b shows the potentials for the @xmath22-wave phase shift @xmath125 corresponding to @xmath126 [ permitted by the corollary ( nonsingular case , full line ) ] and @xmath127 [ violating the corollary ( two - singularity case , dotted line ) ] .",
    "we note that the second singularity of the dotted curve in fig .",
    "2b lies out of the region shown and , as expected form the _ proof _ , the singular potentials in fig . 2a and 2b have one and two locally non - integrable region(s ) corresponding to @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "+    [ fig2 ]    applications ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) of the cox - thompson scheme for @xmath130 suggest the existence of a connection similar to the corollary of section 2 that specifies one nonsingular potential out of the possible infinite singular solutions .",
