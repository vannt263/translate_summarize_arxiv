    "decentralized control of networked multi - agent systems has received a considerable amount of attention during the last decade .",
    "numerous applications of decentralized control laws have been studied including flocking ( e.g. , @xcite ) , alignment and formation control ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) , distributed estimation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , sensor coverage ( e.g. , @xcite ) and distributed control of robotic networks ( e.g. , @xcite ) , to name a few . in a distributed framework ,",
    "a global task is achieved by the local interactions of agents among each other without a centralized control .",
    "some tasks only require a common agreement between the agents , whereas others may ask for agents to achieve some definite configuration in terms of their defined states .",
    "for such tasks , a fundamental question is whether such a decentralized system can be controlled by directly manipulating only some of the agents .",
    "this question motivates our analysis of the controllability of networked systems .",
    "controllability of networked systems was initially addressed in @xcite , where a connection between the spectral properties of the underlying graph modelling a network , and the controllability of the system was analyzed .",
    "a more topological analysis of the problem was later presented in @xcite with an emphasis on how the symmetry with respect to the leader node affects the controllability of the system .",
    "more general conditions were presented in @xcite by introducing equitable partitions in the analysis .",
    "these concepts were extended along with additional results in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", these equitable partitions were used to obtain an upper bound on the rank of the controllability matrix .",
    "recently , distance partitions are used in @xcite to obtain a lower bound on the rank of the controllability matrix for single - leader networks . in this paper",
    "we analyse leader - follower networks in which the agents utilize a nearest - neighbor averaging rule .",
    "some agents , called the _ leaders , _ support external control inputs that ultimately influence the dynamics of all other agents namely _ followers _ by spreading throughout the network .",
    "we explore the controllability of the overall system under this setting .",
    "our main result is a topological lower bound on the rank of the controllability matrix for any graph structure with multiple leaders .",
    "this lower bound is based on distances of nodes to the control nodes , and it can easily be computed directly from the network topology , without having to rely on any rank test or spectral analysis of the graph .",
    "this problem was studied for single - leader networks in @xcite , and a lower bound was obtained using the distance partition with respect to the leader . in this work ,",
    "we tackle the general problem with possibly multiple leaders by extending the use of distance based relationships to such cases .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : section [ prelim ] presents some preliminaries related to the system dynamics and algebraic graph theory . in section [ controllability ] , we present our controllability analysis .",
    "section [ compute ] provides an algorithm to compute the proposed lower bound on the rank of the controllability matrix for arbitrary networks .",

    "for each particular agent @xmath1 , the consensus equation is given as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the state of agent @xmath1 , and @xmath4 is the set of agents neighboring agent @xmath1 . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath5 , and the interactions among the agents are encoded via a static undirected graph @xmath6 . in this graph",

    "their states asymptotically converge to the stationary mean , if and only if the underlying graph is connected @xcite .",
    "assume that we would like to control this network simply by applying external control signals to some of the nodes .",
    "without loss of generality , let the first @xmath11 nodes be the leaders taking the external control inputs , and let the remaining @xmath12 nodes be the followers whose dynamics are governed by ( [ consensus ] ) .",
    "let the @xmath11 dimensional control input be represented by vector @xmath13 .",

    "in this section we will analyse the controllability of the system given in ( [ sys ] ) .",
    "in particular , we present relationships between the network topology and the rank of the controllability matrix for such systems .",
    "we start this section by referring to the results based on the equitable partitions presented in @xcite .",
    "a _ partition _ of a graph @xmath6 is given by a mapping @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the cell that node i gets mapped to , and we use @xmath32 to denote the domain to which @xmath33 maps , i.e. , @xmath34 .",

    "note that for any graph @xmath35 there is a unique maximal leader - invariant eep , @xmath40 .",
    "examples of maximal leader - invariant eeps are depicted in fig .",
    "[ eepfig ] .",
    "maximal leader - invariant eeps are useful structures in the controllability analysis since the states of the nodes that appear in the same cell of the maximal leader - invariant eep asymptotically converge to the same value @xcite .

    "the upper bound given in theorem [ upperbound ] is quite useful in analyzing the controllability of a leader - follower network .",
    "for instance , one can conclude that a system is not completely controllable if there exists non - singleton cells in its maximal leader - invariant eep .",
    "however , all the cells being singletons does not necessarily imply that the network is completely controllable .",
