    "recently there has been increasing interest in the point to point resistance of finite resistor networks . for an up to date list of references",
    "see [ 1 ] .",
    "wu [ 2 ] expressed the resistance of a finite graph in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the kirchhoff matrix [ 3 ] avoiding the zero eigenvalue .",
    "he also used his method to obtain the resistance of a rectangular grid with various boundary conditions .",
    "recently chair [ 4],[5 ] has used wu s formula to obtain exact formulae for the complete graph minus n edges and the n - cycle graph with first and second neighbours .",
    "essam and wu [ 6 ] used one of the results of [ 2 ] to find an asymptotic expansion for the resistance between opposite corners of a rectangular network with free boundary conditions .",
    "this was extended by izmailian and huang [ 1 ] to other boundary conditions .",
    "izmailian , kenna and wu [ 7 ] have recently introduced a modification of a the method of wu [ 2 ] .",
    "their new method also avoids the zero eigenvalue of the kirchhoff matrix by expressing the resistance in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a principal cofactor .",
    "this method will be referred to here as the ikw method .",
    "current interest lies in rectangular networks with zero resistance along one edge . here the case of free boundary conditions along the other three edges will be considered .",
    "contracting the zero resistance branches leads to a network which can be displayed as a fan ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 fan will be supposed to have n radial lines and m transverse arcs . the main topic of this article is the derivation of the resistance between two nodes of a fan network in general position . the result is shown in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the special case with one node at the apex and the other on the boundary has appeared in [ 8 ] .",
    "tan and coworkers [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] introduced a cobweb network which has periodic boundary conditions in the direction parallel to the zero resistance edge .",
    "the case @xmath4 of an @xmath2 cobweb network is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the cobweb network is related to the fan network by joining corresponding nodes on the first and last radial lines of the fan .",
    "the formula for the symmetric case of the fan with n odd and both input and output nodes on the central radial line yields the result for the cobweb with both nodes on any single radial line .",
    "the cobweb network may also be thought of as a network embedded on the surface of a cylinder with resistors along the length and round the circumference and one end closed .",
    "izmailian , kenna and wu [ 7 ] used their kirchhoff matrix method to obtain the resistance of the cobweb network between two nodes in general position .",
    "the ikw method requires the solution of two eigenvalue problems and results in a double summation . for the fan resistance considered here we use the method of tan , zhou and yang [ 10 ] which requires the solution of just one eigenvalue problem together with the solution of a linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients .",
    "the final formula ( 2.2 ) involves only a single summation . by a simple change of boundary condition the cobweb formula of [ 7 ]",
    "is reproduced .",
    "tan , zhou and yang [ 10 ] considered the resistance of an @xmath2 cobweb network between a node at the center and a node on the boundary . on the basis of results for general n and m = 1 , m = 2 [ 9 ] and m = 3 [ 10 ] they conjectured the result for general m and n ( see section 2.2.1 ) .",
    "the case m = 4 was proved by tan , zhou and lou [ 11 ] .",
    "the conjecture for general m and n has recently been proved by izmailian , kenna and wu [ 7 ] as a special case of their formula for the resistance between an arbitrary pair of nodes on the cobweb .",
    "further analysis was required to reduce their double summation to the single summation formula of the conjecture .    a proof of the above conjecture for odd n by the present authors [ 8 ] results from restricting the calculation to the resistance between the apex and a general node on the boundary of the fan . as noted above the resistance when the node of the fan is in the midpoint of the boundary",
    "is the same as that of the cobweb .",
    "the method used was a simplification of the one used here .",
    "the proof [ 8 ] was shorter than that of izmailian et al [ 7 ] due to the simpler method and restricted domain .",
    "formulae for both the fan ( 2 ) and cobweb network ( 6 ) with input and output nodes in general position are presented in section 2 .",
    "also simplifications of the formulae are considered when both nodes are on the same radial or transverse line . in section 3 the details of the method",
    "are given in the context of the fan .",
    "section 4 gives the change in boundary condition required to obtain the cobweb formula .",
    "the results are discussed in section 5 where the method used here [ 10 ] is summarised and compared with the ikw method [ 7 ] .",
    "in general the fan has @xmath6 radial lines labelled from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "its resistance @xmath9 will be determined between two nodes , one , @xmath10 , distant @xmath11 up the radial line @xmath12 and the other , @xmath13 , distant @xmath14 up the radial line @xmath15 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "let @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "further suppose that @xmath19 are the greater and lesser solutions of @xmath20 with @xmath21 the result is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the cobweb network the @xmath7 and @xmath8 lines are joined by additional branches to create cylindrical boundary conditions .",
    "the result is independent of @xmath25 and @xmath26 and depends only on @xmath14 , @xmath11 and the transverse distance @xmath27 between @xmath13 and @xmath10 as expected . in section 4 the fan proof is simply extended to the cobweb by changing only the boundary condition with the result @xmath28 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( 6 ) is equivalent to equation ( 30 ) of izmailian , kenna and wu [ 7 ] .",
    "their summation runs from @xmath29 to @xmath30 and in their notation @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34    so that @xmath35 and hence @xmath9 and @xmath36 are determined by the resistance ratio and @xmath37 apart from the parameters @xmath38 .",
    "the formulae may be simplified in the following two special cases which for the cobweb already appear in [ 7 ] but with different notation .      without loss of generality",
    "we take the line to be @xmath39 and set @xmath40 . in this case",

    "if @xmath44 is the apex then @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "this is because in this symmetric case of the fan the potentials on the left and right radial boundaries are equal .",
    "thus when the nodes on the left radial line are joined to the corresponding nodes on the right radial line no current flows through the connecting branches .",
    "the resistance of the cobweb network so formed is therefore the same as for the fan .",
    "tan et al [ 10 ] conjectured that the resistance from center to the boundary of the cobweb network is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 $ ] .",

    "this is the proof of izmailian , kenna and wu [ 7 ] .",
    "setting @xmath61 implies @xmath62 so that the numerator of the summand in ( 2 ) becomes @xmath63 .",

    "we also reproduce the result ( 6 ) of izmailian , kenna and wu [ 7 ] for the related cobweb network .",
    "their method is quite different from ours in that it requires the diagonalisation of two matrices instead of one .",
    "also significant further work is required to reduce their formula from two to a single summation .",

    "the two networks are related by connecting corresponding nodes in the radial boundaries .",
    "it is argued that because of the symmetry there will be no flow in the connecting bonds and hence the resistance equality .",
    "the method of tan et al [ 10 ] used here splits the derivation into three parts .",
    "the first creates a matrix relation between the current distributions on three successive radial lines .",
    "the second part diagonalises the matrix relation to produce a recurrence relation involving only variables on the same transverse line .",
    "the relation is second order with constant coefficients and is solved in the third part .",
    "basically the method reduces the problem from two dimensions to one dimension .",
    "equation ( 20 ) can be written in the form @xmath141 which when @xmath114 reduces to the discrete laplace equation .",
