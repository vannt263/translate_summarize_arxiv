    "the @xmath1 meson plays a key role in the experimental search for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion collision experiments where an anomalous suppression of its production cross section relative to the drell - yan continuum as a function of the centrality of the collision has been found by the cern - na50 collaboration @xcite . an effect like this has been predicted to signal qgp formation @xcite as a consequence of the screening of color charges in a plasma in close analogy to the mott effect ( metal - insulator transition ) in dense electronic systems @xcite .",
    "however , a necessary condition to explain @xmath1 suppression in the static screening model is that a sufficiently large fraction of @xmath2 pairs after their creation have to traverse regions of qgp where the temperature ( resp .",
    "parton density ) has to exceed the mott temperature @xmath3 @xcite for a sufficiently long time interval @xmath4 , where @xmath5 mev is the critical phase transition temperature and @xmath6 fm / c is the @xmath1 formation time . within an alternative scenario @xcite , @xmath1 suppression",
    "does not require temperatures well above the deconfinement one but can occur already at @xmath7 due to impact collisions by quarks from the thermal medium .",
    "an important ingredient for this scenario is the lowering of the reaction threshold for string - flip processes which lead to open - charm meson formation and thus to @xmath1 suppression .",
    "this process has an analogue in the hadronic world , where e.g. j/@xmath8 could occur provided the reaction threshold of @xmath9 mev can be overcome by pion impact .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that this process and its in - medium modification can play a key role in the understanding of anomalous @xmath1 suppression as a deconfinement signal . since at the deconfinement transition",
    "the @xmath10- mesons enter the continuum of unbound ( but strongly correlated ) quark- antiquark states ( mott- effect ) , the relevant threshold for charmonium breakup is lowered and the reaction rate for the process gets critically enhanced .",
    "thus a process which is negligible in the vacuum may give rise to additional ( anomalous ) @xmath1 suppression when conditions of the chiral/ deconfinement transition and @xmath10- meson mott effect are reached in a heavy - ion collision but the dissociation of the @xmath1 itself still needs impact to overcome the threshold which is still present but dramatically reduced .    for this alternative scenario as outlined in @xcite to work the @xmath1 breakup cross section by pion impact is required and its dependence on the masses of the final state @xmath10- mesons has to be calculated .",
    "both , nonrelativistic potential models @xcite and chiral lagrangian models @xcite have been employed to determine the cross section in the vacuum .",
    "the results of the latter models appear to be strongly dependent on the choice of formfactors for the meson - meson vertices .",
    "this is considered as a basic flaw of these approaches which could only be overcome when a more fundamental approach , e.g. from a quark model , can determine these input quantities of the chiral lagrangian approach .    in the present paper",
    "we would like to reduce the uncertainties of the chiral lagrangian approach by constraining the formfactor from comparison with results of a nonrelativistic approach which makes use of meson wave functions @xcite .",
    "finally , we will obtain a result for the off - shell @xmath1 breakup cross section which can be compared to the fit formula used in @xcite .",
    "this quantity is required for the calculation of the in - medium modification of the @xmath1 breakup due to the mott - effect for mesonic states at the deconfinement / chiral restoration transition which has been suggested @xcite as an explanation of the anomalous @xmath1 suppression effect observed in heavy - ion collisions at the cern - sps @xcite .",

    "notice that @xmath14 transforms in a so - called non - linear representation of the @xmath15 group .",
    "the usual multiplet of pseudoscalar mesons is @xmath16 , @xmath17 are gell - mann matrices . to introduce vector and axial - vector mesons",

    "at this level of the chiral symmetry all spin- 1 mesons have the same `` bare '' mass ,  @xmath30 .",
    "the remaining terms in ( 5 ) are so - called non - minimal terms since they contain higher orders in the derivatives as well as the mixed term ( @xmath31 ) . after the diagonalization of ( 5 ) we obtain the lagrangians with pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons",
    "( see appendix ) .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) contains many degrees of freedom .",
    "we can consider the special case when vector mesons are desribed as dynamical gauge bosons .",
    "it corresponds to the `` hidden '' chiral symmetry .",
    "we choose a gauge where left- and right - handed fields in the lagrangian will be identical to the vector field @xmath32 : @xmath33 and @xmath34 this can be achieved by a gauge transformation which conserves the @xmath28 symmetry @xmath35 with the specific choice @xmath36 and @xmath37 , so that pseudoscalar mesons are gauge parameters .",
    "now we can rewrite the lagrangian ( 5 ) as a sum of three lagrangians    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    note that we have added two gauge invariant terms to the lagrangian ( 5 ) . the second term ( with the coefficient b ) in ( 10 )",
    "plays an important role in the description of the width of the @xmath41  decay , and the third term ( with the coefficient c ) maintains the gauge invariance of the j/@xmath42  decay .",
    "applying the substitutions ( 7 ) to the lagrangian ( 5 ) , we obtain @xmath43 @xmath44    @xmath45    where the vector mass and the vector - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar coupling are defined by  @xmath46   .",

    "the chiral lagrangian aproach for @xmath1 breakup by light meson impact makes the assumption that mesons and meson - meson interaction vertices are pointlike ( four - momentum independent ) objects .",
    "this neglect of the finite extension of mesons as quark - antiquark bound states has dramatic consequences : it leads to a monotonously rising behaviour of the cross sections for the corresponding processes , see the dashed lines in fig .",
    "this result , however , can not be correct away from the rection threshold where the tails of the mesonic wave functions determine the high - energy behaviour of the quark exchange ( in the nonrelativistic formulation of @xcite ) or quark loop ( in the relativistic formulation @xcite ) diagrams describing the microscopic processes underlying the @xmath1 breakup by meson impact . as long as the mesonic wave functions describe",

    "numerical results have been obtained for the pion impact processes with the result that the d - meson exchange in the t - channel is the dominant subprocess contributing to the @xmath1 breakup .",
    "the use of formfactors at the meson - meson vertices is mandatory since otherwise the high - energy asymptotics of the processes with hadronic final states will be overestimated , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . from a comparison of the monopole and gaussian functions in the global formfactor ansatz , we observe a big difference in the corresponding cross sections above the threshold .",
    "generally we would prefer the use of gaussian functions which are motivated by strong ( confining ) quark - antiquark interactions within the mesons .",

    "the considered pion impact subprocess is in good correspondence to the one from the nonrelativistic quark exchange model .",
    "finally , we want to present an exploratory study of the influence of a variation of the final state d - meson masses on the effective @xmath1 breakup cross section .",
    "our motivation for considering mesonic states to be off their mass - shell is their compositeness which can become apparent in a high - temperature ( and density ) environment at the deconfinement / chiral restoration transition , when these states change their character qualitatively being resonant quark- antiquark scattering states in the quark plasma rather than on - shell mesonic bound states .    the consequence of this mott - transition from bound to resonant states for the @xmath1 breakup has been explored by burau et al .",

    "this behaviour is qualitatively approved within the present chiral u(4 ) lagrangian + formfactor model although the subthreshold enhancement is more moderate , see fig .",
