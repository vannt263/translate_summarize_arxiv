    "when a ferrofluid layer is subjected to a vertically oriented and uniform magnetic field , above a critical value of the field strength a hexagonal pattern of peaks appears on the surface of the liquid .",
    "this rosensweig or normal field instability was first observed by cowley and rosensweig in 1967 @xcite .",
    "further increase of the magnetic field up to a second threshold gives rise to a transition from the hexagonal to a square planform @xcite .",
    "the arrangement of peaks resulting from the rosensweig instability into patterns of different geometry is just one particular example from an impressive variety of pattern formation in physical systems @xcite .",
    "it is well known that although the instability threshold itself can be obtained from a linearized version of the underlying equations , the pattern selection problem requires the inclusion of non - linear terms .",
    "a standard procedure to probe the non - linear regime perturbatively is by means of amplitude equations @xcite .",
    "however , unlike many other examples of pattern forming physical systems discussed in the literature the surface profile of a ferrofluid in a static magnetic field is an equilibrium structure . accordingly",
    "the relative stability of planforms and possible transitions between different patterns can be investigated theoretically by studying the appropriate thermodynamical potential .",
    "still the problem is a complicated non - linear task since the local magnetic field determining the surface profile in turn depends on the surface deflection via boundary conditions . as a consequence the variational minimization of the thermodynamic potential in the surface profile",
    "can not be accomplished exactly and one has to resort to approximate procedures applicable in the experimentally relevant situation of slightly overcritical magnetic fields .    in classical investigations along these lines gailitis @xcite and kuznetsov and spektor @xcite analyzed the stability of the different patterns of the rosensweig instability by means of an energy minimization principle .",
    "these as well as related investigations using methods of functional analysis @xcite or a generalized swift - hohenberg equation @xcite were confined to fluid layers of infinite depth .    on the other hand experimental investigations",
    "are usually done with rather thin fluid layers and the effects of finite thickness on the _ linear _ regime have been studied recently in great detail .",
    "for example the dispersion relation of surface waves on a ferrofluid layer of arbitrary thickness was determined in @xcite and the influence of viscosity on the linear dynamics was elucidated in @xcite . taking advantage of the dependence of the threshold of instability and the wavelength of the most unstable mode on the thickness of the fluid layer in a clever way ,",
    "it is e.g. possible to measure both the normal and the anomalous dispersion branch of surface waves on ferrofluids @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we complement these investigations by a thorough study of the weakly non - linear regime of the rosensweig instability slightly above the critical magnetic field for a ferrofluid of arbitrary depth . taking the limit of infinite layer thickness",
    "we also critically discuss the classical findings obtained in @xcite .",
    "moreover we are able to quantify the restriction to sufficiently small susceptibilities @xmath1 of the fluids which was always used in previous studies .",
    "our method of investigation is a generalization of the variational minimization of an energy functional already used in @xcite . near the instability",
    "this functional may be written as a power series in the amplitude of the surface deflection and the minimization can be performed explicitly .",
    "moreover our approach allows the theoretical investigation of the wavenumber selection problem addressed also in recent experiments @xcite . including the wavenumber @xmath0 into the set of variational parameters we determine the dependence of the wavenumber of the patterns on the magnetic field and",
    "investigate the influence of a varying wavenumber on the stability of hexagons and squares .",
    "therefore by a slight extension of our method we are able to study questions which are not easily accessible to other non - linear methods , as e.g. amplitude equations .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formulation ] the basic equations are collected and transformed into a form suitable for the calculation of the energy . in section [ sec : ansatz ] a perturbation ansatz for the surface deflection is put forward and the important issue of its consistency and region of validity is discussed . section [ sec : infinite ] is devoted to the comparison of our findings with the classical results of pattern selection in a fluid with infinite depth . subsequently in section [ sec : finite ] we consider a ferrofluid layer with arbitrary thickness and analyze the effects of the finite depth on the stability of the patterns . in section [ sec : wavenumber ]",

    "this is in particular pronounced for the square pattern and implies that in this case the system may lower its energy very efficiently by increasing the wavelength of the pattern .",
    "this effect introduces an additional threshold for @xmath90 into the stability chart shown in in fig .",
    "[ fig : stabsquares ] .",
    "if @xmath169 we find @xmath170 and the pattern disappears by increasing its wavelength to infinity .",
    "this process is accompanied by an unbounded increase of the amplitudes @xmath171 which carries us outside of the validity of our perturbation ansatz ( [ eq : pertan ] ) .",
    "the stability regions of the other pattern remain qualitatively the same as without minimization in @xmath0 as can be seen from a comparison between figures [ fig : stabsquares ] and [ fig : stability ] .    for supercritical magnetic fields a whole band of wavenumbers giving rise to stable patterns exists . for hexagons",
    "this stability region is shown in fig.[fig : band ] . at fixed @xmath90",
    "the hexagonal planform becomes unstable if the wavenumber is increased sufficiently .",
    "in @xcite such an increase of the wavenumber was achieved experimentally by compressing the hexagonal pattern in a hopper .",
    "the observed transition from a hexagonal to a square pattern with smaller wavenumber occurs when the limit @xmath172 of the stable @xmath0-band is exceeded and is hence in qualitative agreement with our theory .",
    "in the present paper we have theoretically investigated the formation of patterns on the free surface of a ferrofluid resulting from the rosensweig instability . for a ferrofluid layer of arbitrary depth @xmath74 in an external magnetic field",
    "@xmath2 the equilibrium surface profile was determined by minimizing the appropriate thermodynamic potential .",
    "we have assumed a linear dependence of the magnetization on the magnetic field which is at most 5% off the correct values for the experimentally situations with which we compare our findings .",
    "the analysis is restricted to the vicinity of the critical magnetic field at which the flat interface becomes unstable since it uses a perturbation expansion for the energy up to fourth order in the amplitude of the surface deflection .",
    "our findings generalize the classical results of gailitis @xcite and kuznetsov and spektor @xcite to layers of finite depth @xmath173 .",
    "we have found that , at least for the slightly supercritical magnetic fields considered , the finite thickness of the ferrofluid layer can be neglected as long as it remains larger than the critical wavelength of the linear instability which in typical experiments is about 1 cm . for thinner layers",
    "nonlinear effects become increasingly important .",
    "this shows up quite generally in more pronounced hysteresis effects for the transition between different planforms .",
    "we also find smaller values of the susceptibilities for which squares and ridges may appear through backward bifurcations and correspondingly higher order terms in the energy are necessary to saturate the instabilities .",
    "the critical values of the susceptibility @xmath1 beyond which our theory breaks down are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : critical ] . together with the findings shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : validation ] they quantify the qualitative statement @xmath174 used in @xcite .",
    "an extension of our analysis including higher orders similar to what has been done in @xcite for the one - dimensional situation seems feasible but rather tedious .",
    "it is possible to understand the enhanced hysteretic behaviour for thin layers qualitatively .",
    "a thin layer inhibits surface deformations resulting from the rosensweig instability ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hckc ] ) since the magnetic field energy is suppressed due to the finite depth of the layer . on the other hand for the developed pattern the magnetic flux",
    "is concentrated at the peaks of the surface so that the effective layer depth becomes larger .",
    "correspondingly the pattern is additionally stabilized and decays only after a reduction of the field stronger than expected from the linear theory .",
    "a similar reasoning explains why backward bifurcations of ridges and squares are facilitated in thin layers .",
    "in addition to determining the stable planforms by minimizing the energy functional in the amplitudes of the different modes present in our ansatz for the surface profile , we have also addressed the problem of wavenumber selection by including the wavenumber modulus @xmath0 into the set of variational parameters .",
    "we found quite generally a decrease of the wavenumber of the pattern with increasing magnetic field .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with recent experiments by abou _",
    "_ @xcite in which the the field intensity was abruptly increased to overcritical values and the corresponding wavelength @xmath175 of the resulting hexagonal pattern was found to increase with increasing field .",
    "likewise it was found that the wavenumber @xmath0 of the hexagonal pattern is already for slightly supercritical magnetic fields smaller then the critical wavenumber @xmath176 . the corresponding difference @xmath177 is also found in the theory and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zetak ] .",
    "unfortunately a quantitative comparison with the experimental results is impossible since in the experiment a ferrofluid with a susceptibility of @xmath178 was used .",
    "for such a susceptibility the theoretical analysis would require higher order terms in the perturbation expansion of the energy .",
    "nevertheless we found that @xmath177 grows with increasing susceptibility such that the experimentally observed value of a few percent agrees well with our result for @xmath177 at smaller susceptibilities @xmath131 .",
    "moreover the theoretical analysis has shown that when including the wavenumber into the set of variational parameters the square pattern gets rather susceptible to an unbounded increase in the wavenumber .",
    "this gives rise to a reduced stability domain for squares and may be related to the fact that in the experiments using jumps in the field intensity always hexagonal arrays of peaks were found @xcite .",
    "quite generally our results verify that the resulting planform may depend on the details of the experimentally chosen way to reach overcritical magnetic fields .",
    "let us finally stress that the variation of the wavenumber of the patterns with the external field as found here theoretically and observed in the experiments does not invalidate our ansatz with a fixed wavenumber used before .",
    "as reported in @xcite the wavenumber of the arising hexagonal pattern coincides with @xmath176 if the magnetic field is increased and decreased in a quasi - static way .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the boundary conditions suppress the emergence or disappearance of peaks in a developed pattern . therefore using the quasi - static process",
    "a metastable pattern with @xmath176 is produced whereas a jump in field intensity gives rise to the most stable pattern corresponding to a smaller wavenumber .",
