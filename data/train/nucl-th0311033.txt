    "a number of brief accounts of the modern application of dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) to hadron physics and qcd have recently appeared @xcite .",
    "they have recapitulated on aspects of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , and the expression of these phenomena in the hadron spectrum ; and contain original contributions regarding : comparisons between dse results and lattice simulations , and the mutual benefits of such comparisons @xcite ; the pion and its excited states @xcite ; and states with vacuum quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "we have a modicum to add .",
    "we begin with qcd s renormalised gap equation @xmath1 wherein : @xmath2 is the dressed - gluon propagator ; @xmath3 is the dressed - quark - gluon vertex ; @xmath4 is the @xmath5-dependent current - quark bare mass ; and @xmath6 represents a translationally - invariant regularisation of the integral , with @xmath5 the regularisation mass - scale .",
    "we employ a pauli - villars scheme , which is implemented in eq.([gendse ] ) by considering the quarks as minimally anticoupled ( @xmath7 ) to additional massive gluons ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this effects a tempering of the integrand that is expressed via a modification of the gluon propagator s ultraviolet behaviour : @xmath9 through which the integral s superficial linear divergence is regulated .",
    "the regularising mass - scale is naturally removed to infinity as the last stage in the calculation of any renormalisable quantity . in eq.([gendse ] ) , @xmath10 are respectively the quark - gluon - vertex and quark wave function renormalisation constants , which depend on @xmath5 and the renormalisation point , @xmath11 , as does the mass renormalisation constant @xmath12 .",
    "the gap equation s solution has the form @xmath13 ,   \\label{sinvp}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the running quark mass , . ] and is obtained subject to the renormalisation condition @xmath15 the renormalisation scheme should be understood to yield mass - independent renormalisation constants .",
    "the gap equation illustrates the features and flaws of each dse .",
    "it is a nonlinear integral equation for @xmath16 and hence can yield much - needed nonperturbative information .",
    "however , the kernel involves the two - point function @xmath2 and the three - point function @xmath3 .",
    "the gap equation is therefore coupled to the dses these functions satisfy .",
    "those equations in turn involve higher @xmath17-point functions and hence the dses are a tower of coupled integral equations with a tractable problem obtained only once a truncation scheme is specified .",
    "it is unsurprising that the best known truncation scheme is the weak coupling expansion , which reproduces every diagram in perturbation theory .",
    "this scheme is systematic and valuable in the analysis of large momentum transfer phenomena because qcd is asymptotically free but it precludes any possibility of obtaining nonperturbative information , which we identified as a key aspect of the dses .",
    "the gap equation describes the manner in which the propagation of a quark is affected by the medium being traversed , and the same is true of the gauge sector gap equations satisfied by gluon and ghost schwinger functions .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equations are the necessary complement as they provide the means by which one may understand how qcd s elementary excitations form the colour singlet bound states that are the observable manifestation of strong interaction dynamics .",
    "an important example is the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation for the axial - vector vertex : @xmath18_{tu } = z_2 \\left[\\gamma_5 \\gamma_\\mu \\frac{\\tau^j}{2}\\right]_{tu } + \\int^\\lambda_q \\left [ \\chi_{5\\mu}(q;p ) \\right]_{sr } \\",
    ", k_{tu}^{rs}(q , k;p ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 with @xmath20 $ ] and , plainly , we focus on @xmath21 so that @xmath22 are pauli matrices in flavour space . the conventions of eq.([avbse ] ) describe a vertex with total momentum @xmath23 and relative momentum @xmath24 , whose outgoing quark and antiquark legs carry momenta @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the appearance here of @xmath27 $ ] expresses the arbitrariness in defining the relative momentum in a poincar covariant framework : physical observables will be independent of @xmath28 in a symmetry preserving truncation , as seen , e.g. , in ref.@xcite . of particular importance in eq.([avbse ] ) is @xmath29 , the fully amputated dressed quark - antiquark scattering kernel .",
    "this four - point schwinger function also appears implicitly in qcd s gap equation because it is one piece of the kernel in the inhomogeneous integral equation satisfied by @xmath30 .",
    "a primary measure of our comprehension of strong qcd is the possession of a veracious understanding of the pion , and for this a clear grasp of the nature of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking are vital . in asymptotically free theories , chiral symmetry and its breaking are completely expressed via the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity : @xmath31 wherein the new elements are the current - quark mass matrix : @xmath32 $ ] , and the pseudoscalar vertex @xmath33_{tu } = z_4 \\left[\\gamma_5 \\frac{\\tau^j}{2}\\right]_{tu } + \\int^\\lambda_q \\left [ \\chi_{5}(q;p ) \\right]_{sr } \\ , k_{tu}^{rs}(q , k;p ) \\,.\\ ] ]    the last two terms of eq.([avwtim ] ) vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "the identity is then a concise statement of chiral symmetry , a consequence of which is plainly an intimate relation between the three - point function in eq.([avbse ] ) and the two - point function in eq.([gendse ] ) . since dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is an essentially nonperturbative phenomenon , satisfying our measure of comprehension requires that there exist a nonperturbative and systematic truncation scheme which preserves identities such as eq.([avwtim ] ) .",
    "at least one such scheme exists @xcite : a dressed - loop expansion of the dressed - quark - gluon vertices that appear in the half - amputated dressed - quark - antiquark scattering kernel : @xmath34 , and that is sufficient to arrive via the dses at exact results in qcd .",
    "for example , it is a general property that the axial - vector vertex , obtained via eq.([avbse ] ) , exhibits a pole whenever @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mass of any pseudoscalar @xmath37-@xmath38 meson ; viz .",
    ", @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the @xmath41 bound state s bethe - salpeter amplitude : @xmath42 , \\label{genpibsa}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 , its leptonic decay constant @xmath44 where the trace is over colour , flavour and spinor indices . equation ( [ fpin ] ) is the precise expression in quantum field theory for the pseudo__vector _ _ projection of the meson s bethe - salpeter wave function onto the origin in configuration space .",
    "the appearance of @xmath45 guarantees that @xmath43 is gauge invariant , and independent of the regularisation scale and renormalisation point .    the lowest mass pole contribution to eq.([genavv ] ) , denoted by @xmath46 , is the ground state pion , which receives the spectroscopic assignment @xmath47 in the naive @xmath48 quark model .",
    "the @xmath49 pseudoscalar meson poles correspond to those excited states of the pion that would receive the spectroscopic assignments @xmath50 in the quark model .",
    "the pseudoscalar vertex , @xmath51 , which appears in eq.([avwtim ] ) , also exhibits such a pole : @xmath52 and here the residue @xmath53 expresses the pseudo__scalar _ _ projection of the meson s bethe - salpeter wave function onto the origin in configuration space .",
    "the appearance of @xmath54 guarantees that @xmath55 is gauge invariant , independent of the regularisation scale , and evolves correctly under the renormalisation group .    in qcd",
    "it therefore follows from eqs.([genavv ] ) and ( [ genpvv ] ) , as a necessary consequence of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking , that for any pseudoscalar @xmath37-@xmath38 meson @xcite @xmath56 \\ ,   \\rho_{\\pi_n}(\\zeta)\\,.\\ ] ] ( this expression is valid independent of the magnitude of the current - quark mass and , following ref.@xcite , the generalisation to @xmath57-flavour is straightforward . )",
    "the so - called gell - mann  oakes  renner relation for the ground state pion appears as a corollary of eq.([gmorgen ] ) @xcite , and another important corollary of eq.([gmorgen ] ) , valid for pseudoscalar mesons containing at least one heavy - quark , is described in refs.@xcite .",
    "in addition , the proof of eq.([gmorgen ] ) establishes @xcite that in the chiral limit @xmath58 namely , in the chiral limit the leptonic decay constant vanishes for _ every _ pseudoscalar meson _ except _ the ground state pion .",
    "this result in particular is a constraint on models and theoretical methods used to search for exotics and hybrids .",
    "the leading - order term in the scheme of refs.@xcite is the renormalisation - group - improved rainbow - ladder truncation , which is expressed in the bethe - salpeter equations via @xmath59_{ts }   \\left[\\rule{0mm}{0.7\\baselineskip }           \\frac{\\lambda^a}{2}\\gamma_\\sigma\\right]_{r u}\\!,\\ ] ] with @xmath60 an _ operative _ coupling , and in the truncated gap equation through : @xmath61    this truncation can be used to correlate lattice data on dressed - quark and -gluon schwinger functions @xcite .",
    "it is also a reliable tool in the study of vector and flavour nonsinglet pseudoscalar channels @xcite , and has been refined and exploited by maris and tandy in a series of articles via a one - parameter model for the operative coupling : @xmath62 } \\ , { \\cal f}(q^2 ) \\ , , \\label{gk2}\\ ] ] wherein @xmath63)]/q^2 $ ] , @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66gev ; @xmath67 ; @xmath68 ; and @xmath69gev .",
    "this form expresses the interaction as a sum : the second term ensures that perturbative behaviour is preserved at short - range ; and the first makes provision for enhancement ( strong coupling ) at long - range .",
    "the true parameters in eq.([gk2 ] ) are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which together determine the integrated infrared strength of the rainbow - ladder kernel .",
    "however , they are not independent : in fitting to a selection of observables , a change in one is compensated by altering the other ; e.g. , on the domain @xmath72\\,$]gev , the fitted observables are approximately constant along the trajectory @xmath73 @xcite . hence eq.([gk2",
    "] ) is a one - parameter model .",
    "this correlation : a reduction in @xmath70 compensating an increase in @xmath71 , ensures a fixed value of the interaction s integrated infrared strength .",
    "it also defines a single dressed - glue mass - scale that characterises infrared gluodynamics : @xmath74    using maris and tandy s model for the operative coupling , the rainbow - ladder truncation yields @xcite @xmath75gev ; @xmath76gev ; @xmath77 , at a current - quark mass @xmath78mev .",
    "this model is currently being employed in a rainbow - ladder analysis of @xmath79 pseudoscalar mesons , and it has been reported @xcite that when only the @xmath80 term in eq.([genpibsa ] ) is retained , , @xmath81 that are approximately @xmath82% smaller than experiment . ]",
    "one obtains : @xmath83 cf .",
    "@xmath84 ; and @xmath85 at the physical ( nonzero ) current - quark mass .",
    "the latter result indicates that eq.([fpiniszero ] ) is a good approximation even at real - world current - quark masses and thereby emphasises its usefulness as a constraint .",
    "a correct description of the neutral pion s two - photon decay is another stringent test of one s understanding of strong qcd , and that understanding again relies fundamentally on a true comprehension of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breakdown . to illustrate this we consider the renormalised impulse approximation to the axial - vector  vector  vector ( avv ) vertex : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and the electric charge matrix @xmath88=e\\,{\\rm diag}[2/3,-1/3]$ ] . in eq.([tmnr ] ) , the dressed - quark propagator is determined by the rainbow gap equation , and the dressed vector and axial - vector vertices are obtained from the dressed - ladder truncation of the relevant inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "it is apparent from eq.([genavv ] ) that for @xmath89 ; namely , in the neighbourhood of the pion pole , @xmath90 is dominated by the @xmath91 coupling and therefore plays a role in describing that decay .",
    "the bare avv vertex exhibits a superficial linear divergence and as with all other schwinger functions it must be rigorously defined via a translationally invariant regularisation scheme . in this case",
    "the appropriate pauli - villars prescription corresponds to minimally anticoupling the photon to additional flavoured quarks with a large mass @xmath92 . to elucidate we",
    "introduce @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the renormalisation point invariant current - quark mass and every element in the integrand is calculated using this current - quark mass in the appropriate rainbow - ladder truncated dse .",
    "in this case eq.([tmnr ] ) is explicitly @xmath95 with @xmath96 as the last step in the calculation .",
    "we now focus on the chiral limit , @xmath97 , and consider the divergence of the avv vertex at @xmath98 ; viz .",
    ", in the neighbourhood of the massless pion s pole : @xmath99 equation([ptmnr ] ) follows from the vector vertex analogue of eq.([avbse ] ) and the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity depicted in fig.[figavwti ] , , where @xmath100 is the unamputated renormalised rainbow - ladder - dressed quark - antiquark scattering matrix . ] which is an extension of @xmath101 and can be derived following the method in ref.@xcite : the identity is valid if , and only if , every dressed - quark propagator that appears therein is obtained from the rainbow dse , eq.([rainbowdse ] ) , and the accompanying dressed vertices are determined from the consistent ladder bethe - salpeter equation ; i.e. , the equation constructed using eq.([ladder ] ) and the rainbow quark propagator . it is plain that in the chiral limit eq.([ptmnr ] ) does not contain terms which depend on the light - quark mass .",
    "this axial - vector ward - takahashi identity is an extension of eq.([avwti0 ] ) .",
    "it is valid if , and only if : the dressed - quark propagator , @xmath102 , is obtained from eq.([rainbowdse ] ) ; the axial - vector vertex , @xmath103 , is obtained from eq.([avbse ] ) with the kernel constructed from @xmath102 and eq.([ladder ] ) ; the pseudoscalar vertex is constructed analogously ; and the unamputated renormalised quark - antiquark scattering matrix : @xmath104 $ ] , is constructed from the elements just described.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    consider the first term on the r.h.s .  of eq.([ptmnr ] ) .",
    "the complete polarisation integral is convergent , by virtue of our regularisation , and must yield a rank - two lorentz pseudotensor depending on only one four - vector argument , @xmath105 .",
    "a nonzero value is impossible .",
    "the second term vanishes for the same reason .",
    "let s turn to the last term .",
    "the only relevant contribution appears in the limit @xmath106 , in which case all dressing is suppressed and we are left to evaluate @xmath107    recall now that at any order in the nonperturbative , systematic , symmetry - preserving dse truncation scheme of refs.@xcite , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking entails that in the chiral limit the divergence of the axial - vector vertex is dominated by the pion pole in the neighbourhood of @xmath108 .",
    "this result is expressed in eq.([genavv ] ) .",
    "it follows that in the rainbow - ladder truncation , which is the leading - order in that scheme , @xmath109 consequently , in the chiral limit , the bose - symmetrised amplitude for @xmath0 decay @xmath110    in eq.([apigg ] ) we have arrived at the textbook result with no dependence on model details ; viz . , independent of the detailed form of the operative coupling , eq.([alphamt ] ) , and thereby provided an explanation of the numerical analysis reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "in doing so we have made plain that the impulse approximation expressed in eqs.([tmnr ] ) and ( [ pi0gg ] ) is the precise and only truncation of the six - point schwinger functions relevant to this decay which is consistent with the rainbow - ladder truncation .",
    "it follows that the `` seagull terms '' identified in ref.@xcite are absent at this order but may appear in a consistent treatment of the process at an higher order of truncation .",
    "moreover , it is generally true that seagull terms are absent in the consistent rainbow - ladder analysis of any six - point quark schwinger function .",
    "there are many additional applications of interest to this audience , of which a variety are reviewed in refs.@xcite , and one may say that the keystones of success in modern dse usage are : an appreciation and expression of the momentum - dependence of dressed - parton propagators at infrared length - scales ; and the identification and employment of a nonperturbative , systematic , symmetry preserving truncation scheme .",
    "one topic of material importance , worth mentioning explicitly here , is the pion s valence quark distribution .",
    "the dse calculation @xcite agrees with perturbative qcd s prediction @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath111 in the valence region , it must be borne in mind that the pion s bethe - salpeter amplitude is momentum dependent at every regularisation scale .",
    "this is an essential feature of qcd and any calculation which overlooks it is immaterial . ] but this is inconsistent with extant data @xcite and a recent transverse lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between data and the expectation from perturbative qcd can not be resolved using contemporary simulations of lattice - regularised qcd @xcite .",
    "it raises difficult questions and has prompted proposals for remeasurement of the distribution function @xcite .",
    "we have omitted a discussion of contemporary challenges confronting the application of dses in hadron physics and qcd .",
    "important amongst these are : the development of a veracious picture of the infrared behaviour of the bethe - salpeter kernel ; and the extension of the framework to processes involving baryons .",
    "this list is not exhaustive .",
    "nonetheless , comments on the former may be found in refs.@xcite and the latter in refs.@xcite .",
