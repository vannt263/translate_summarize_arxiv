    "in other words , @xmath161 is the positive flat corresponding to some subgraph @xmath376 of @xmath15 , and we must show @xmath391 is a connected matroid .",
    "this is a consequence of ( iii ) and lemma [ lemma2 ] .",
    "we now give our main result .",
    "let @xmath14 be an arbitrary coxeter system , with root system @xmath4 , coxeter diagram @xmath15 , and associated oriented matroid @xmath219 .",
    "then the face poset of the coarse subdivision of @xmath6 is dual to the face poset of the graph associahedron @xmath17 .    by theorem [ face ] , we need to show that the face poset of ( the coarse subdivision of ) @xmath6 is equal to the poset of tubings of @xmath15 , ordered by containment .",
    "we begin by describing a map @xmath392 from flags of positive flats to tubings of @xmath15 .    by proposition",
    "[ coxeter - flats ] , positive flats of @xmath5 correspond to subsets @xmath375 or subgraphs @xmath376 of the coxeter graph @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , a positive flat is connected if and only if @xmath376 is a tube , and hence an arbitrary positive flat corresponds to a disjoint union of compatible tubes , no two of which are nested . since an inclusion of flats corresponds to an inclusion of the subsets @xmath330 , a flag @xmath31 of positive flats corresponds to a nested chain of such unions of non - nested compatible tubes , that is , to a tubing @xmath393 .",
    "furthermore , in this correspondence , inclusion of flags corresponds to containment of tubings .",
    "we claim that the map from flags to tubings is surjective . given some tubing of @xmath15 , linearly order its tubes @xmath394 by any linear extension of the inclusion partial",
    "ordering , and then the flag @xmath31 of positive flats having @xmath37 spanned by @xmath395 will map to this tubing .",
    "lastly , we show that @xmath392 is actually a well - defined injective map when regarded as a map on cells of the coarse subdivision of @xmath373 . to do so , it is enough to show that two flags @xmath199 of positive flats give the same tubing if and only if @xmath42 and @xmath396 coincide . by lemma  [ coxeter - flats](iv ) and",
    "proposition  [ circuitous - prop ] , we need to show that @xmath393 and @xmath397 coincide if and only if @xmath155 and @xmath398 coincide . but",
    "this is clear , because by construction , the rooted forest @xmath155 ignores the ordering within the flag , and only records the data of the tubes which appear , that is , the tubing .",
    "the positive bergman complex of a coxeter arrangement is simplicial , and is in fact , a flag simplicial sphere .",
    "another corollary of our proof is a new realization for the positive bergman complex of a coxeter arrangement : we can obtain it from a simplex by a sequence of _ stellar subdivisions _",
    "( since stellar subdivisions are dual to the truncations defining the graph - associahedra ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    "in this section we will give a concrete description of the bergman complex of a coxeter arrangement , in terms of the nested set complex .",
    "we will also address a question of eugene tevelev @xcite concerning the relationship of the positive bergman complex to the bergman complex in this setup .",
    "nested set complexes are simplicial complexes at the combinatorial heart of de  concini and procesi s subspace arrangement models @xcite , and of the resolution of singularities in toric varieties @xcite .",
    "we now recall the definition of the minimal nested set complex of a meet - semilattice @xmath399 , which we will simply refer to as * the * nested set complex of @xmath399 , and denote @xmath400 . for the sake of avoiding the technicalities of infinite semilattices , matroids , and coxeter groups , we will assume that * everything is finite * in this section .",

    "a set @xmath90 of irreducibles is _ nested _ if for any nonempty antichain @xmath404 in @xmath90 , @xmath405 is _ not _ irreducible .",
    "these nested sets are the simplices of @xmath400 .",
    "if @xmath2 is a matroid and @xmath48 is its lattice of flats , we will also call @xmath406 the nested set complex of @xmath2 , and denote it @xmath407 .",
    "it is easy to see that the irreducible elements of @xmath48 are the connected flats of @xmath2 .    for any finite coxeter system @xmath14 and associated finite root system @xmath4 ,",
    "the coarse subdivision of the bergman complex @xmath7 of the coxeter arrangement of type @xmath4 is equal to the nested set complex @xmath408 .",
    "in particular , the bergman complex @xmath7 is a simplicial complex .",
    "we offer two proofs of this result .",
    "the first is short , but not very self - contained in that it invokes a result of feichtner and sturmfels .",
    "they showed that , for any matroid @xmath2 , the simplicial complex @xmath407 has a geometric realization which is intermediate in coarseness between the fine and coarse subdivisions of the bergman complex @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , they gave the following criterion for when @xmath407 and the coarse subdivision of @xmath0 coincide .",
    "* theorem 5.3 ) the nested set complex @xmath407 and the bergman complex @xmath0 together with its coarse subdivision coincide if and only if the matroid @xmath185 is connected for every pair of flats @xmath183 in which @xmath184 is connected .",
    "on the other hand , one might suspect that in the case of a coxeter arrangement , theorem  [ theorem1 ] describing the positive bergman complex @xmath1 , and theorem  [ theorem2 ] about the entire bergman complex @xmath0 , should be related by theorem  [ posbergmanscoverbergman ] showing that @xmath0 is covered by several copies of @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of the remainder of this section is to develop this connection , in the context of arbitrary oriented matroids , partly in order to answer the question of tevelev mentioned earlier , and partly for its own interest .",
    "we begin in the setting of an ( unoriented ) matroid @xmath2 , giving the relationship between nested sets and the labelled forest @xmath155 associated to a flag of flats of @xmath2 in proposition [ forest - determines - matroid ] .",
    "this next proposition can be gleaned implicitly from the material in ( * ? ? ?",
