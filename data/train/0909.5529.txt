    "conventionally , hard processes involving incoming protons , such as deep - inelastic lepton  proton scattering , are described in terms of scale - dependent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "these distributions correspond to the density of partons in the proton with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath7 , integrated over the parton transverse momentum up to @xmath8 .",
    "they satisfy dglap evolution in the factorisation scale @xmath9 , and are determined from global analyses of deep - inelastic and related hard - scattering data",
    ". however , for semi - inclusive processes , parton distributions unintegrated over @xmath0 are more appropriate .",
    "for example , unintegrated parton distributions play an important rle in the description of the transverse momentum dependence of different inclusive hard processes , such as inclusive jet production in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite , electroweak boson production  @xcite , prompt photon production  @xcite , azimuthal correlations in high-@xmath10 dijet production  @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover , the exclusive cross sections for vector meson photoproduction  @xcite or central exclusive diffractive higgs boson production  @xcite are also calculated in terms of the unintegrated parton distributions .",
    "in fact , so - called ` @xmath0-factorisation ' was originally established  @xcite for heavy - quark pair production , so that the cross section for @xmath11 is of the form : @xmath12 where the @xmath13 are the gluon densities of the incoming protons , unintegrated over @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 is the number of gluons in the longitudinal and transverse momentum intervals from @xmath7 to @xmath16 and from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , respectively , and @xmath19 is the @xmath20 subprocess cross section .    in general , the unintegrated distributions , @xmath21 ,",
    "depend on two hard scales , @xmath0 and @xmath9 , and so the evolution is much more complicated .",
    "the additional scale @xmath9 plays a dual rle . on the one hand it acts as the factorisation scale , while on the other hand it controls the angular ordering of the partons emitted in the evolution . in refs .",
    "@xcite a prescription was given which allows the unintegrated distributions to be determined from the well - known integrated distributions .",
    "the prescription was based on the fact that due to strong @xmath0 ordering , inherent in dglap evolution , the transverse momentum of the final parton is obtained , to leading - order ( lo ) accuracy , just at the final step of the evolution .",
    "thus the @xmath0-dependent distribution can be calculated directly from the dglap equation keeping only the contribution which corresponds to a single real emission , while all the virtual contributions from a scale equal to @xmath0 up to the final scale @xmath9 of the hard subprocess are resummed into a sudakov - like @xmath22-factor .",
    "the factor @xmath22 describes the probability that during the evolution there are no parton emissions .    , where the off - shell quark has virtuality @xmath23 , and on the right - hand side ( b ) , the conventional qcd approach using integrated parton densities , @xmath24 , where the incoming partons are on - shell .",
    "[ fig : lojets ] ]    the idea is that , considering inclusive jet production in dis , for example , the lo diagram at @xmath25 computed using @xmath0-factorisation will already include , to a good approximation , the main effects ( which are of kinematical origin ) of the conventional lo qcd diagrams at @xmath26 computed using collinear factorisation .",
    "this approximate equality is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : lojets ] . the cross section for any hard process",
    "is then determined by convoluting the unintegrated parton distributions with the off - shell subprocess cross sections where the incoming partons have virtuality @xmath27 . to be precise",
    ", it is necessary to also take account of the fraction @xmath28 of the light - cone momentum of the parent parton carried by the ` unintegrated ' parton , that is , to use ` doubly - unintegrated ' parton distributions  @xcite , @xmath29 , where the off - shell parton now has virtuality @xmath23 .",
    "the doubly ( or ` fully ' ) unintegrated distributions preserve the exact kinematics of the partonic subprocess ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and we speak of @xmath30-factorisation . here , we wish to extend the ` last step ' lo prescription for determining unintegrated parton distributions to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : lo ] we recall the lo prescription , then we extend it to nlo in section  [ sec : nlo ] .",
    "we show numerical results in section  [ sec : num ] and conclude in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "more details of the nlo derivation are given in an appendix .",
    "it is useful to review how lo unintegrated parton distributions , @xmath21 , may be calculated from the conventional ( integrated ) parton densities , @xmath24 , in the case of pure dglap evolution . as usual , we adopt a physical ( axial ) gauge , which sums over only the transverse gluon polarisations , so that the ladder - type diagrams dominate the evolution .",
    "recall that the number of partons in the proton with longitudinal ( or , to be precise , light - cone plus are @xmath31 . ] ) momentum fraction between @xmath7 and @xmath32 and transverse momentum @xmath0 between zero and the factorisation scale @xmath9 is @xmath33 , whereas the number of partons with longitudinal momentum fraction between @xmath7 and @xmath32 and transverse momentum squared between @xmath17 and @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "thus the unintegrated distributions must satisfy the normalisation relation , , are beyond nlo accuracy . ]",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "we start from the lo dglap equations evaluated at a scale , but at lo level this is the same .",

    "the two terms on the right - hand sides of eqs .   and",

    "the virtual ( loop ) contributions may be resummed to all orders by the sudakov form factor , @xmath44 @xmath45 which , recall , give the probability of evolving from a scale @xmath0 to a scale @xmath9 without parton emission .",
    "thus , from eqs .",

    "we find that @xmath51_{k_t=\\mu_0}^{k_t=\\mu } \\nonumber \\\\   & = & a(x,\\mu^2 ) - a(x,\\mu_0 ^ 2)\\,t_a(\\mu_0 ^ 2,\\mu^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus ,",

    "@xmath54 so that the density of partons in the proton is constant for @xmath55 at fixed @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "so far , we have ignored the singular behaviour of the unregularised splitting kernels , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , at @xmath58 , corresponding to soft gluon emission .",
    "these soft singularities cancel between the real and virtual parts of the original dglap equations , eqs .   and .",
    "so it was enough to replace an explicit cutoff by the so - called ` @xmath59 ' prescription .",
    "now , when real emission ( which changes the @xmath0 of the parton ) and the virtual loop contribution ( which does not change the kinematics of the process ) are treated separately , we must introduce the infrared cutoff explicitly .",
    "the singularities indicate a physical effect that we have not yet accounted for .",
    "it is the angular ordering caused by colour coherence  @xcite , which implies an infrared cutoff on the splitting fraction @xmath28 for those splitting kernels where a real gluon is emitted in the @xmath60-channel .",
    "indeed , the polar angle @xmath61 ordering @xmath62 implies the ordering of the ratios @xmath63 , that is , of the rapidities @xmath64 .",
    "the light - cone components of the massless gluon-@xmath65 momentum ( @xmath66 ) satisfy @xmath67 , while the ratio of the momenta in the proton direction is given by the ratio of the momentum fractions carried by the @xmath68-channel gluons ( see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath69 .",
    "if we denote @xmath70 then we obtain @xmath71 in the last step the angle is limited by the value of factorisation scale @xmath9 .",
    "if we choose @xmath72 for dis in the breit frame , then the last inequality reads  @xcite @xmath73 which leads to @xmath74 and provides the inequality @xmath75 .",
    "thus the factorisation scale , @xmath9 , is entirely determined from the kinematics of the subprocess at the ` top ' of the evolution ladder  @xcite .",

    "note that in the expression for the unintegrated distribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fa ] ) , the derivative of @xmath86 with respect to @xmath87 gives the right - hand side of the usual dglap equation , which contains both the real emission ( which we are looking for ) and the virtual loop contribution .",
    "however the virtual contribution is cancelled by the derivative of @xmath88 with respect to @xmath87 .    in the next section",
    "we introduce an analogous prescription for unintegrated parton distributions which may be justified at nlo accuracy .",
    "first , we discuss the structure of the nlo contribution . the original definition was that the amplitude was decomposed into the perturbative sum @xmath89 where @xmath90 denote the lo , nlo , nnlo , @xmath91 contributions .",
    "however , nowadays the analogous decomposition is used for the anomalous dimensions , @xmath92 , which describe the evolution in terms of the ope operators , e.g.  mellin moments , @xmath93 , @xmath94 rather than for the amplitude .",

    "[ fig : evol ] .",
    "we have strong ordering of the transverse momenta , @xmath98 , _ between _ the splitting functions , but no ordering in the transverse momenta of the @xmath68-channel partons which enter the nlo ( nnlo , @xmath91 ) splitting functions .    here",

    "there should be strong @xmath0 ordering between the loops which correspond to the nlo coefficient function and to the nlo splitting function .",

    "we seek the prescription which gives the unintegrated @xmath102 distribution of the parton to nlo accuracy .",

    "secondly , we must take care of the precise value of the scale at which the parton densities @xmath86 are measured , and of the limits in the integrations over the terms which include the lo splitting functions . in the dglap evolution equation",

    "this is true at lo , but not at nlo , where a pair of massless partons may be created .",

    "@xmath104 at lo level , or at very small @xmath28 , this scale difference is negligible .",
    "however , to reach nlo accuracy we have to account for this effect , at least in the lo part of the splitting functions .",

    "<S> we show how parton distributions unintegrated over the parton transverse momentum , @xmath0 , may be generated , at nlo accuracy , from the known integrated ( dglap - evolved ) parton densities determined from global data analyses . </S>",
    "<S> a few numerical examples are given , which demonstrate that sufficient accuracy is obtained by keeping only the lo splitting functions together with the nlo integrated parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is important to keep the precise kinematics of the process , by taking the scale to be the virtuality rather than the transverse momentum , in order to be consistent with the calculation of the nlo splitting functions .    </S>",
