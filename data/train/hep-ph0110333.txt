    "the introduction of effective chiral lagrangians to account for the basic symmetries of qcd and its application through @xmath6 to the study of meson meson interaction @xcite or meson baryon interaction @xcite has brought new light into these problems and allowed a systematic approach . yet , @xmath6 is constrained to the low energy region , where it has had a remarkable success , but makes unaffordable the study of the intermediate energy region where resonances appear . in recent years , however , the combination of the information of the chiral lagrangians , together with the use of nonperturbative schemes , have allowed one to make prediction beyond those of the chiral perturbation expansion .",
    "the main idea that has allowed the extension of @xmath6 to higher energies is the inclusion of unitarity in coupled channels . within the framework of chiral dynamics",
    ", the combination of unitarity in coupled channels together with a reordering of the chiral expansion , provides a faster convergence and a larger convergence radius of a new chiral expansion , such that the lowest energy resonances are generated within those schemes .",
    "a pioneering work along this direction was made in @xcite where the lippmann schwinger equation in coupled channels was used to deal with the meson baryon interaction in the region of the @xmath4 and @xmath7 resonances .",
    "similar lines , using the bethe salpeter equation in the meson meson interaction , were followed in @xcite and a more elaborated framework was subsequently developed using the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite and the n / d method @xcite .",
    "the iam method was also extended to the case of the meson baryon interaction in @xcite and in @xcite where a good reproduction of the @xmath8 resonance was obtained using second order parameters of natural size .",
    "the n / d method has also been used for @xmath9 scattering @xcite and in the @xmath10 and coupled channels system in @xcite .",
    "a review of these unitary methods can be seen in @xcite .",
    "the consideration of coupled channels to study meson baryon interactions at intermediate energies has also been exploited in @xcite using the k - matrix approach , although not within a chiral context .",
    "the bethe salpeter equation was also used in the study of the the meson baryon interaction in the strangeness @xmath11 sector in @xcite and in the @xmath0 sector around the @xmath4 region in @xcite . in this latter work , aimed at determining the @xmath12 coupling ,",
    "only the vicinity of the resonance was studied and no particular attention was given to the region of lower energies .",
    "subsequently a work along the same lines using the bethe salpeter equation , but considering all the freedom of the chiral constraints , was done in @xcite and a good reproduction of the experimental observables was obtained for the @xmath13 sector .",
    "those works considered only states of meson baryon in the coupled channels and both in @xcite and @xcite the @xmath2 channel was omitted .",
    "this channel plays a moderate role in the @xmath13 sector @xcite but , as we shall see , it plays a crucial role in the @xmath3 sector .",
    "our aim in the present work is to extend the chiral unitary approach to account for the @xmath2 channel , including simultaneously some other corrections inspired by vector meson dominance ( vmd ) which finally allow one to have a reasonable description of the meson baryon interaction up to meson baryon energies of around 1600 mev .",
    "the @xmath4 resonance is generated dynamically in this approach and the mass , width and branching ratios are obtained in fair agreement with the experiment .",
    "the phase shifts and inelasticities for @xmath9 scattering in that region are also evaluated and good agreement with experiment is also found both in the @xmath13 and @xmath3 sectors . in addition some trace of the @xmath5 is found , linked to the introduction of the @xmath2 channel , with a pole in the second riemann sheet with the right energy , albeit a large width .",
    "a side effect of the calculations is that we determine the s - wave part of the @xmath14 transition amplitude , revising previous determinations in @xcite and @xcite , and together with the p - wave amplitudes previously determined , we obtain a good reproduction of the cross sections for these reactions .",
    "in this section we study the meson baryon scattering in s - wave in the strangeness @xmath0 sector .",
    "we shall make use of the bethe salpeter equation in coupled channels considering states of a meson of the @xmath15 octet and a baryon of the @xmath16 octet , as required by the su(3 ) chiral formalism .",
    "for total zero charge we have six channels , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the bethe salpeter equation is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the product of the meson and baryon propagators .",
    "the diagrammatic expression of the @xmath25 matrix is shown in fig.[fig : bseq ] .",
    "following @xcite we take the kernel ( potential ) of the bethe salpeter equation from the lowest order chiral lagrangian involving mesons and baryons @xmath26 \\label{eqn : lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the su(3 ) matrices for the octet baryon field and the octet meson field respectively , and @xmath29 is the weak decay constant of the meson . from this lagrangian ,",
    "the transition potentials between our six channels are given by @xmath30 with the initial(final ) baryon spinor @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and the initial(final ) meson momentum @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath35 , reflecting the su(3 ) symmetry of the problem , are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lagrangian ] ) and shown in table [ tbl : cij ] .    .@xmath35 coefficient in the potential . @xmath36 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the lower part of table [ tbl : coupling ] shows the same quantities obtained from a breit - wigner fit of the real energy scattering amplitudes @xmath37 .",
    "we fit them by the breit - wigner form together with a background @xmath38 at @xmath39 mev .",
    "the unknown parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are determined by the method of least squares .",
    "we obtain the values of @xmath43 from the @xmath44 corresponding to the @xmath19 final state amplitudes .",
    "their absolute value agree fairly well with the values obtained from the pole residues and gives us confidence about our numerical evaluation of the couplings .",
    "for instance , the @xmath9 , @xmath19 and @xmath2 branching ratios are now 24 % , 67 % and 9 % respectively .",
    "this latter analysis allows us to determine the sign of the couplings .",
    "the signs given are relative to that of @xmath45 .",
    "it is instructive to decompose the resonance in the su(3 ) representations .",
    "in fact , our result , ignoring the coupling to the @xmath2 channel , leads to @xmath46 and tells us that the @xmath4 resonance is almost an equal weight mixture of the r - parity even su(3 ) octet @xmath47 and the r - parity odd su(3 ) octet @xmath48 .",
    "it would be interesting to compare these results with the results from other models or lattice qcd simulations .",
    "we have studied the s - wave @xmath9 scattering , together with that of coupled channels , in a chiral unitary model in the region of center of mass energies from threshold to 1600 mev .",
    "we calculated the t matrix using the bethe - salpeter equation in the eight coupled channels including six meson - baryon channels and two @xmath2 channels .",
    "we took the transition potentials between the meson - baryon systems from the lowest order chiral lagrangian and improved them taking into account the vector meson dominance hypothesis .",
    "then we introduced the appropriate @xmath49 transition potentials which influence both the elastic scattering and the pion production processes . in the present model the renormalization due to higher order contributions",
    "is included by means of subtraction constants in the real part of the propagators of the two or three - body systems , which are taken as free parameters and determined through comparison with the t matrix of the data analysis .",
    "the imaginary part of the meson - baryon or @xmath2 propagators is fixed and ensures unitarity in the s matrix .",
    "a realistic t matrix is obtained with a few free parameters for energies up to 1600 mev .",
    "the phase - shifts and the inelasticities are well reproduced in both isospin 1/2 and 3/2 .",
    "we find that the correction of the chiral coefficient and the @xmath2 channels are important to obtain an accurate t matrix , especially in isospin 3/2 .",
    "our analysis allowed us to determine the s - wave amplitudes for @xmath50 and we found that the isospin 3/2 @xmath49 amplitude is different from the two previous empirical ones .    the resonance @xmath4 is generated dynamically and qualifies as a quasi bound state of meson and baryon .",
    "the corresponding pole is seen in the t matrix on the complex plane .",
    "we calculate the total and partial decay width of the resonance .",
    "the total width obtained , about 80 mev , is smaller than the pdg estimation , but agrees with the new data from bepc .",
    "also the large @xmath19 branching ratio observed in the data is reproduced .",
    "the present study has served to show the potential of the chiral unitary approach extending the predictions to higher energies than it would be possible with the use of @xmath6 . yet",
    ", we also saw that improvements in the basic information of the lowest order chiral lagrangians to account for phenomenology of vmd are welcome . on the other hand we found mandatory the inclusion of the @xmath51 channels in order to find an accurate reproduction of the data , particularly those in the isospin 3/2 sector .",
    "we also found that the introduction of these channels , forcing them to reproduce the inelasticities and other data , has as an indirect consequence that the @xmath5 resonance appears then as a pole in the complex plane indicating a large mixing of this resonance with @xmath51 states .",
    "this interpretation would be consistent with the large experimental coupling of this resonance to the @xmath51 channel .",
    "we would like to acknowledge discussions with j.c . ncher .",
    "one of us , t. i. , would like to thank j.a .",
