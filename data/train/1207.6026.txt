    "granular matter dissipates energy by friction and inelastic collisions , therefore an external driving is necessary to observe dynamical behaviors . despite their intrinsic macroscopic and non - equilibrium nature , the resulting excited state , from granular gas to an ordered compact set of grains , often shares similarities with the one of thermal systems described by statistical physics at equilibrium",
    "however , important non - equilibrium features emerge , like the absence of a universal effective temperature , deviations from fourier s conduction law , spatio - temporal instabilities , the absence of scale separation , and so forth .",
    "granular matter is therefore a good candidate to study non - equilibrium phase transitions between these different excited states @xcite .    the transition of granular media from liquid - like to solid - like states have been already reported . under shearing or vertical tapping ,",
    "monodisperse spheres tend to collectively organize themselves in the most dense crystal state @xcite . when a monolayer of grains that is confined between two horizontal plates is vibrated vertically , unexpected ordered structures nucleate from the liquid state at high excitation @xcite .",
    "this phase separation is driven by the negative compressibility of the effective two dimensional fluid , as in the van der waals model for molecular fluids @xcite .    in the present experiment ,",
    "we are concerned by granular systems where an another interaction is added to the usual hard sphere collisions .",
    "to do so , we use pre - magnetized spheres .",
    "magnetized spheres have been studied under an external applied magnetic field @xcite . when a set of these magnetized spheres , compacted by gravity , is submitted to a vertical magnetic field ,",
    "the surface of the granular packing is destabilized above a given onset and forms peaks @xcite . when a granular gas is submitted to an increasing horizontal magnetic field at a given excitation , a transition to a clustered state",
    "is observed @xcite .",
    "a mixture of magnetic and non - magnetic spheres has been also studied in a configuration similar to ours , but at a lower volume fraction of the magnetic particles and in an horizontal plate with no top lid , which limits the energy injection as the system is kept in a quasi - two - dimensional state . in this mixed system , authors focused on the existence and the growth in time of clusters composed of solely magnetic particles , in the bath of non - magnetic ones , as function of control parameters @xcite .    in our study , no external field is added and the remanent magnetic moment , present in all the particles , generates a dipolar interaction between them .",
    "this kind of 2d dipolar liquid ( with 3d magnetostatics ) has been extensively studied numerically in order to understand the transition from isolated to branched chains @xcite . compared to our experiments ,",
    "an important difference is that these numerical studies are performed at equilibrium .",
    "also , they use a lower surface density , @xmath12 up to 0.4 ( were @xmath13 is the particle diameter , @xmath14 is the number of particles , and @xmath15 is the system size ) . numerical studies also introduce the reduced temperature @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the magnetic moment of the sphere and @xmath13 their diameter . although it is not easy to estimate it in our experiments , we verified at least that the attractive force between particles with aligned moments is weak .",

    "therefore @xmath21 can be crudely estimated by @xmath22 , using a granular temperature proportional to the energy per grain provided by a vibration of amplitude @xmath23 and angular frequency @xmath24 , and using @xmath25 .",
    "one gets @xmath26 , which is actually in the range of temperature accessible numerically .",
    "a comparison between experiments and numerical studies seems promising .    here , we present an experimental study of the behavior of a sub - monolayer of pre - magnetized particles that are confined in a shallow geometry , with a height that is small compared to the horizontal dimensions .",
    "the system is therefore quasi - two - dimensional with three - dimensional magnetostatics .",

    "an hysteretic behavior is observed whether the acceleration of the cell is increased or decreased . in section [ sec : quench ] , we present results starting from a liquid - like state , from which we quench the system into the hysteresis region in order to study the dynamical growth of the ordered phase . after presenting our experimental observations on the dynamical evolution of solid clusters ,",

    "the evolution of the parameters of this law as function of the quenched acceleration is presented and the values of fitted parameters are discussed . in section [ sec : model ] we present a theoretical model for the solid cluster s growth , taking into account the specificity of our experiment , in particular the conserved number of particles and the constant volume .",

    "in order to model crystal growth in our system , we need to consider a few important considerations : first , the transition occurs at constant volume , which in practice implies a constant surface @xmath147 , with @xmath148 the surface occupied by the ( 2d ) solid cluster at time @xmath149 and @xmath150 the surface available for the disordered liquid phase at that time .",

    "indeed , they are just related by a geometrical factor : @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the mean cluster radius at time @xmath149 and @xmath79 a geometrical constant of order of the grains diameter .",
    "for instance , for a perfectly ordered crystal in hexagonal close packing one gets @xmath156 next , we can establish a _ detailed balance _",
    "equation to determine the time evolution of @xmath157 .",
    "this can be written @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the probability by unit time that a particle of the disordered phase is captured by the solid cluster and @xmath160 is the probability by unit time that a particle escapes from the cluster to the liquid phase .",
    "the first can be estimated crudely as the collision frequency between a cluster and the liquid particles which have a velocity small enough to be caught by the former .",
    "if we characterize these particles by their mean velocity @xmath161 , we assume @xmath162 since @xmath163 is almost the cross - section of the cluster ( for @xmath164 .",
    "now , particles leaving a cluster have to be at its perimeter",

    "therefore , because for simplicity we consider an almost circular cluster we obtain @xmath166 both @xmath161 and @xmath165 would depend on quench acceleration @xmath5 , on the distance to @xmath86 , that is @xmath167 , on the particle density @xmath168 and on dipole magnetization @xmath17 .",

    "we study the dynamical growth of the ordered clusters , which can arise after a time delay . the time evolution of the number of particles in the solid - crystal phase is well fitted by a stretched exponential law , but also by relation  ( [ tauvsn ] ) that we have obtained analytically .",

    "indeed , instead of the 2d thermal motion used in numerical studies , a particle in the solid phase collides the bottom and top plates during an excitation period . the vertical motion might disadvantage the formation of long chains , and compact clusters might be more stable under such driving .",
    "moreover , in contrast to numerical simulations , the magnetic dipole moments are probably not uniformly distributed in all the particles .",
    "although it is really difficult to estimate the width of dipole moments distribution in our experiment , a faction of them could be small enough to prevent bounding .",
    "the second point deserving discussion is the existence of the quasi - static hysteresis loop when the driving amplitude is slowly modified .",
    "a crucial point is that during a cooling ramp there is a specific driving , @xmath3 , which depending on the particular magnetization history is between @xmath206 and @xmath207 , below which solid clusters grow . due to magnetization reduction and",
    "because @xmath106 and @xmath6 vary with driving amplitude , this specific boundary is very difficult to determine more precisely .",
    "how slow one should vary the driving depends on the time scales that are present in the system , that is on @xmath106 and @xmath6 .",
    "the quench experiments show that , within the hysteresis loop , both times grow strongly with driving amplitude .",
    "these same quench experiments show the existence of another particular acceleration @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , below which @xmath117 .",
    "this onset value seems to be better defined that @xmath3 .",
    "our quasi - static increasing acceleration ramps show that the heating branch of the loop seems to be a stable , adiabatic branch .",
    "in particular , all quasi - static heating ramps follow the same curve and the critical driving above which solid clusters disappear , @xmath208 , is very reproducible . the fact that we are able to follow adiabatically this stable branch",
    "can be understood with the following reasoning :    * a ramp starts at low @xmath0 with a well formed solid cluster ( or clusters ) in coexistence with the liquid phase ; * the driving amplitude is increased in a small amount , which increases the system s kinetic energy ( granular `` temperature '' ) ; * particles in the solid phase but at the cluster s boundary will receive stronger collisions from those in the liquid phase , so the probability of getting ripped off increases ; * this results in a cluster size reduction , more or less continuously as the driving is increased further ; * as the change from the one state to another occurs smoothly , the time it takes can be short .    the fact that @xmath209 demonstrates that there is a metastable region for which the system might stay in a completely fluidized state , but from which eventually a solid cluster will nucleate and grow until a stationary size is reached .",
    "also , quench experiments done for @xmath210 show that the final cluster size is the same as the obtained for the heating ramp ( @xmath211 collapses with @xmath49 of the heating quasi - static loop ) .",
    "this shows that the cooling ramp branch of the quasi - static loop is not stable , implying that the cooling ramp was probably not done slowly enough .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that for a given magnetic interaction strength , the value of @xmath3 depends on the decreasing ramp rate . as the number of solid particles has to grow from the background noise level to the final asymptotic one , then waiting times much longer that @xmath6 are necessary .",
    "another possible route for the metastable state characterization would be to study precursors through density and velocity correlations .",
    "we now turn to the values of @xmath120 used to fit experimental data with a stretched exponential law . at equilibrium",
    ", we would expect an exponent @xmath212 @xcite , where @xmath213 is the spatial dimension , but instead we obtain @xmath214 .",
    "due to the anisotropy of the attractive force , of the special shape of the interface and of the fact that most of the clusters start to grow from boundaries , one could assume that our experiment behaves more like 1d system , but even in this extreme case , we should have get @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "moreover , one has to underline that we are in a out - of - equilibrium dissipative system .",
    "others aspects can therefore play a role , like dissipation , which is probably different in the cluster and liquid phase , or the very particular thermalization imposed by vertical vibration .",
    "this effect could be especially important near the transition where a critical behavior can be expected . actually , an exponent @xmath217 is measured in another out - of - equilibrium system : the slow compaction of granular packing by tapping @xcite , but the meaning of such law is still under debate in this case .",
    "this issue deserves further studies by changing the boundary shape ( from square to circular ) or by doing the experiment in a viscous fluid to modify the dissipation or by exciting the grains by vibration using colored noise with a broad frequency range .",
    "it is clear that the present system is strongly out of equilibrium . despite it can reach stationary states , at coexistence",
    "the effective in plane ",
    "granular \" kinetic temperatures can be very different between the liquid and solid phases . in the metastable region , the transition from the liquid state to the coexisting one can be achieved with the experimental time scales that are available .",
    "this transition occurs because the appropriate fluctuation occurs in the liquid state .",
    "but , once a particle is trapped in the solid state , specially those deep inside the boundary layer , it is very difficult for them to escape .",
    "indeed , from our model we can estimate in a stationary regime that the ratio between the probability rates @xmath159 and @xmath160 is given by @xmath218 for @xmath219 , @xmath220 .",
    "this allows us to propose that the transition in our system is a good candidate to be considered as quasi - absorbing hysteretic phase transition .",
    "however , the relative small size of the system and our imperfect control on the spheres magnetization and therefore on the transition onsets , makes very difficult any quantitative benchmark between our system with other systems exhibiting out - of - equilibrium quasi - absorbing phase transitions .",
    "nonetheless , some promising qualitative similarities can be underlined between our experiment and the out - of - equilibrium transition observed between two turbulent phases of a liquid crystals , transition that belongs to the direct percolation universality class @xcite . in this system",
    "an hysteresis loop is observed between a turbulent phase stable at high excitation ( called dsm2 ) and a quasi - absorbing state ( called dsm1 ) @xcite .",
    "also , an exponential decay of dsm2 phase is observed when it is quenched in the dsm1 stable region @xcite .",
    "computations of the critical exponents is beyond the experimental accuracy accessible with our system and procedures and will need a larger device and also a better control of the magnetic interaction strength .",
