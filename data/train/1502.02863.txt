    "a dark pool is an alternative trading venue where participants do not release their identity and benefit of advantageous prices . while optimal - liquidation problems involving dark pools have been treated in recent works by , e.g. , kratz & schneborn ( 2013 ) , horst & naujokat ( 2014 ) , crisafi & macrina ( 2014 ) , and graewe et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , as far as we know dark pools have not been studied in a market - making context elsewhere . in our situation",
    "the dark pool ( i ) executes incoming buy and sell orders posted by its clients and ( ii ) may post limit and market orders in a lit pool to control the level of its inventory .",
    "this view can be justified by the increasing competition between dark platforms and the reputational benefit deriving from the speed of execution and price advantage .",
    "also , by executing large orders placed by its ( institutional ) clients , the dark pool acquires `` reserved '' information about the traded asset .",
    "furthermore , the dark pool would rather avoid the situation where an investor ( client ) resorts to the lit pool and thus potentially moves the price against the dark pool s holding .",

    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "after the introduction , in section [ eq : model ] , we present the inventory and cash processes of the dark pool and we describe its trading strategies . in section [ eq : optim ] , the optimisation problem is introduced and , by making use of dpp , we derive the hjb equation .",

    "we consider a dark pool that executes incoming buy and sell orders by its clients over a finite period of time @xmath0 and that may resort to the lit pool if its inventory becomes critically small or large . as a reward for the service provided ,",
    "the dark pool chooses a per - share commission @xmath1 for sell orders and @xmath2 for buy orders , which shall not exceed the lit - pool half spread .",
    "the dark - pool order flow is affected by changing @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we may assume for example that the dark pool has a positive inventory at time @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "it can make buy orders more attractive than sell orders , so to rebalance its position on the stock .",

    "such an assumption is supported by the following financial interpretation : the market maker , i.e. the dark pool , is subject to regulations constraints ( e.g. internal risk - management ) which make it hard to hold or short - sell an amount of shares bigger than a fixed authorised quantity . also , the market maker exits the market whenever the cash process has reached either the lower bound ( bankruptcy ) or an upper bound ( gains target ) .",
    "the dark pool can resort to the lit pool to liquidate ( respectively refill ) part of the inventory ; we assume that it can not post speculative orders .",
    "this means that at time @xmath3 $ ] a buy order can be posted only if @xmath42 while a sell order can be posted if @xmath43 .",
    "the dark pool ( market maker ) can post a limit order by specifying a quantity @xmath44 and a limit price @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the optimal distance from the best price , at which it wants to buy or sell .",
    "we only consider immediate - or - cancel orders and we model their execution percentage by a @xmath47$]-valued random variable @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , if a limit order is posted at time @xmath49 , for @xmath50 , then it impacts the inventory and the cash processes as follows : @xmath51 for a limit buy order , the function @xmath52 is non - negative valued and the function @xmath53 is non - positive valued . in fact , a limit buy order , if executed , increases the inventory and reduces the cash amount .",

    "in fact , the market maker tends to resort to the lit pool earlier in order to avoid holding a large inventory at time @xmath176 , which will indeed be very expensive to dispose of .",
    "in the present work we study an optimal market - making problem faced by a dark pool . the dark pool earns the commission fee from executing the trade orders within the pool placed by its clients .",
    "the market agents , who trade through the dark pools , benefit from anonymity and advantageous prices . throughout the activity the pool faces an inventory risk , which can be reduced ( i ) by controlling the width of the dark pool spread , and ( ii ) by resorting to the lit pool via both , market and limit orders .",
    "the dark pool activity is preferred since it protects from information leakage .",
    "such a feature is modelled via a fixed penalty incurred by the dark pool whenever it submits an order to the lit pool . as confirmed by the numerical results ,",
    "the dark pool will refrain from placing orders in a lit pool as long as the size of the inventory is relatively small . whenever a certain level is exceeded , the dark pool resorts to the lit pool by means of limit orders .",
    "a limit order is more remunerative though its execution is uncertain .",
    "the dark pool can choose the limit price ; we find that the more the inventory grows , the closer to the mid - price the dark pool will post .",
    "this is reasonable since the filling - intensity of limit orders depends on how far from the mid - price they are posted . if the inventory becomes critically large , market orders will be preferred instead , which are costly but benefit of sure execution . when the end of the market - making activity approaches ( which , e.g. , might be thought of as the end of the trading day ) the market - orders region in the lit pool widens while the dark - pool and limit - orders regions in the lit pool diminish .",
    "in fact , the market maker will incur in a higher penalty by liquidating a large inventory at the terminal date .",
    "these conclusions are obtained by formulating a double obstacle standard stochastic and impulse control problem , and by showing that the associated value function is the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding dynamic programming equation .",
