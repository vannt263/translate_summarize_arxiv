    "over the past decades , several techniques have been applied to investigate how the critical behavior of systems depends on the range of the interactions . before the general acceptance of the concept of universality , it was not at all clear that the critical properties of all systems with a one - component order parameter and ferromagnetic ( i.e. , attractive ) interactions with a _ finite _ range are described by the ising universality class . since it was realized that most interactions in nature are not necessarily restricted to the nearest neighbors , one thus tried to determine the properties of models with a larger coordination number  @xmath2 .",
    "another motivation , which plays a more important rle in the present work , is the fact that in the limit of infinite interaction range one recovers the classical or mean - field model .",
    "since the latter model can be solved analytically whereas no exact solution has been found for three - dimensional systems with a finite interaction range  @xmath3 , it is of interest to see how the crossover takes place from finite to infinite  @xmath3 .",
    "a natural choice for the examination of this crossover is the so - called `` equivalent - neighbor '' model , introduced by domb and dalton  @xcite . in this generalization of the ising model ,",
    "each spin interacts equally strongly with all its neighbors within a certain distance , whereas all remaining interactions are equal to zero . in ref .",
    "@xcite , series expansions have been used to investigate two- and three - dimensional systems with interactions extending up to the third shell . on a simple cubic lattice this corresponds to 26  neighbors and on a face - centered cubic lattice even to 42  neighbors . while a general trend toward the mean - field properties , especially for the critical temperature , is clearly visible from these results , several problems emerge .",
    "first , with increasing interaction range , increasingly longer series are required to achieve a certain degree of convergence .",
    "secondly , it appears that the maximum coordination numbers examined by this method are not large enough to observe the asymptotic deviations from the mean - field behavior  @xcite .",
    "although ref .",
    "@xcite was published over 30  years ago , it appears that , especially in three dimensions , no substantial progress toward larger coordination numbers has been pursued .",
    "this is probably caused by the fact that also other techniques are plagued by serious difficulties upon increase of the interaction range .",
    "for example , monte carlo  ( mc ) methods in general suffer from a serious decrease in efficiency if the number of interactions increases .",
    "mon and binder  @xcite studied two - dimensional  ( 2d ) spin systems with a maximum coordination number @xmath4 , compared to @xmath5 and @xmath6 for quadratic and triangular lattices , respectively , in ref .",
    "furthermore , they derived the @xmath3  dependence of critical amplitudes from scaling considerations .",
    "however , it still proved difficult to reach the asymptotic regime where the predictions were expected to hold .",
    "in a subsequent paper  @xcite , luijten _ et al .",
    "_  confirmed the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite from a renormalization - group  ( rg ) analysis and revealed the existence of a logarithmic @xmath3  dependence in the shift of the critical temperature .",
    "thanks to the advent of a dedicated mc algorithm for long - range interactions  @xcite , systems with large coordination numbers could be simulated without loss of efficiency .",
    "thus , in the same paper the critical properties were determined for quadratic systems with coordination numbers up to @xmath7 .",
    "it was explicitly verified that all examined systems belong to the 2d  ising universality class and the predicted @xmath3  dependence of the critical amplitudes could indeed be observed , as well as the approach of the critical temperature toward its mean - field value .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to extend this analysis to three - dimensional  ( 3d ) systems .",
    "apart from the possibility to verify the predicted range dependences in three dimensions , a precise knowledge of the critical properties of spin models with an extended range of interaction also serves a further purpose .",
    "namely , it allows the study of two forms of crossover in these systems .",
    "_ finite - size crossover _ only pertains to finite systems at the critical temperature and denotes the transition from the classical regime where the interaction range is at least of the order of ( some power of ) the system size to the nonclassical ( ising ) regime where the system size is much larger than the interaction range .",
    "_ thermal crossover _",
    ", on the other hand , occurs when the temperature is moved away from its critical value .",
    "the interplay between the range  @xmath3 of the interactions and the decreasing correlation length  @xmath8 determines the location of the crossover to classical critical behavior . if @xmath3 is small , the temperature distance to the critical temperature @xmath9 must be made rather large before @xmath8 and @xmath3 are of the same order of magnitude . in such systems , no crossover to mean - field - like critical behavior can be seen , because one has already left the critical region",
    "however , for @xmath3 large , it is well possible to observe both ising - like and classical critical behavior .",
    "this dependence on both @xmath10 and @xmath3 is expressed by the ginzburg criterion  @xcite .",
    "both variants of crossover have been studied for 2d systems in refs .",
    "@xcite , which showed that accurate information on crossover scaling functions can be obtained by numerical techniques . in the light of a comparison to experimental results on the one hand and theoretical calculations of crossover scaling functions on the other hand ,",
    "it is extremely relevant to investigate the 3d case as well .",
    "here , i present the results of mc simulations of systems with interactions up to a distance of @xmath11 lattice units ( thirteenth shell ) , which corresponds to 250  equivalent neighbors .",
    "although larger interaction ranges do not diminish the efficiency of the mc algorithm , an accurate determination of the critical properties for larger  @xmath3 is hampered by a different effect .",
    "indeed , such a determination is only possible in the ising limit , which implies that the _ smallest _ linear system sizes must be of the order of @xmath12  @xcite , where @xmath13 indicates the dimensionality .",
    "thus , for @xmath14 the smallest allowable systems contain of the order of @xmath15 spins and one can only hope that this relation exhibits a prefactor considerably smaller than unity .",
    "the results of the mc simulations are then used to determine the finite - size crossover functions for several quantities .",
    "it should be noted that for a full mapping of these function _ very _ large coordination numbers are required : simulations have been carried out for  @xmath2 up to @xmath1 . yet , an independent determination of the critical temperature of these systems is not required , but can be obtained by extrapolation .",
    "it suffices thus to study modest ( @xmath16 system sizes for these interaction ranges",
    ". the determination of thermal crossover functions will be the subject of a future paper  @xcite , as it requires calculations which are actually complementary to those of the present work ( results for the susceptibility can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed , for a determination of the critical properties by finite - size scaling and for the mapping of the finite - size crossover functions , all data must lie within the finite - size regime , whereas for thermal crossover scaling care must be taken that the data lie outside this regime .    two further questions that are addressed in this paper concern the corrections to scaling .",
    "in the first place , the range dependence of the thermal finite - size corrections is shown to be in very good agreement with the predictions of ref .",
    "secondly , the finite - size corrections due to the leading irrelevant field are analyzed and the related variation of the @xmath17 coefficient in the landau - ginzburg - wilson  ( lgw ) hamiltonian is obtained .",
    "this permits an estimation of the interaction range for which this coefficient coincides with its fixed - point value and confirms that for the three - dimensional nearest - neighbor ising model it does not lie between the gaussian fixed point and the ising fixed point .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , i briefly summarize earlier predictions for the range dependence of critical amplitudes and discuss the shift of the critical temperature as a function of interaction range .",
    "section  [ sec : mc ] gives details of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "furthermore , the determination of the critical temperatures is discussed as well as the analysis of the range dependence of corrections to scaling .",
    "the variation of critical amplitudes as a function of interaction range is treated in sec .",
    "[ sec : rangedep ] and finite - size crossover curves are obtained in sec .  [ sec : cross ] .",
    "i end with some concluding remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "in the absence of an external field , the equivalent - neighbor or medium - range model is defined by the following hamiltonian , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the sum runs over all spin pairs and the spin - spin coupling is defined as @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "i first summarize the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath3 dependence of critical properties , as obtained by an rg analysis .",
    "although at first sight this approach is not very different from a simple scaling analysis , it offers several advantages . the formulation in terms of two competing fixed points provides a clear insight into the crossover mechanism : for @xmath3 large the coefficient of the @xmath17 term in the lgw hamiltonian is suppressed with respect to the quadratic term in this expression .",
    "thus , the renormalization trajectory passes close to the gaussian fixed point and the critical amplitudes pick up a specific @xmath3 dependence which is determined by the flow near this fixed point .",
    "for any finite @xmath3 , the system will still flow to the neighborhood of the nontrivial ( ising ) fixed point ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 in ref",
    ".  @xcite ) . however , the @xmath3 dependence reveals some aspects of the gaussian fixed point which are not normally seen in ising - like systems .",
    "for example , near this fixed point the thermal exponent @xmath24 and the leading irrelevant exponent @xmath25 assume the values 2 and @xmath26 , respectively , which coincide for @xmath27 .",
    "such a coincidence would lead to logarithmic factors in the scaling functions , were it not that the gaussian fixed point is unstable for @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath3 dependence of scaling functions indeed allows the observation of such logarithms .",
    "the occurrence of these dependences is not easily found from a scaling analysis .    for the magnetization density  @xmath28 and the magnetic susceptibility  @xmath29 the following range dependences",
    "have been obtained , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the standard ising critical exponents .",
    "furthermore , the finite - size scaling behavior of these quantities was derived as @xmath33 here , @xmath34 denote universal scaling functions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the thermal and leading irrelevant exponent introduced before , and @xmath35 is the magnetic exponent . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the irrelevant and the magnetic scaling field , respectively .",
    "also the shift of the critical temperature with respect to its mean - field value has been calculated in ref .",
    "however , this treatment left several questions unanswered , which i will consider here in some more detail .",
    "a clear understanding of the nature of this shift is of particular significance for the crossover scaling , since one has to calculate the critical temperatures for systems with large coordination numbers by means of extrapolation .",
    "it was derived that under a renormalization transformation the contribution of the @xmath17 term to the quadratic term in the lgw hamiltonian leads to a range - dependent shift of the reduced temperature @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath27 it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that this shift has the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constants . this expression has also been confirmed numerically , see fig .  4 in ref .",
    "interestingly , this result has been recovered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where in addition it was found that the constant  @xmath41 has a universal value  @xmath42 . indeed",
    ", this agrees with the value @xmath43 obtained from an analysis of the available data for @xmath44 .",
    "( the somewhat lower value @xmath45 , corresponding to the coefficients quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be explained from the influence of the data point at @xmath46 . )",
    "however , the result for general @xmath47 , a shift proportional @xmath48 , clearly contradicts the results obtained from systematic expansions in terms of the inverse coordination number ( but see the remarks at the end of this section ) .",
    "brout  @xcite obtained to leading order a shift of the form @xmath49 .",
    "this result was recovered by vaks _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and dalton and domb  @xcite . as",
    "indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , such an additional and actually dominant shift can also be obtained from the rg analysis by allowing for a ( spherically symmetric ) lower - distance cutoff @xmath50 in the spin - spin coupling @xmath51 . in momentum space",
    "the coupling then takes the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "( a3 ) in ref .",
    "the second term in this expression yields an additional contribution to the quadratic term in the lgw hamiltonian , which is precisely the @xmath56 shift obtained by brout .",
    "furthermore , it contributes to the @xmath57-dependent part of this term , which via the rescaling of the field ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) leads to a @xmath58 shift .",
    "note that , upon expansion in powers of  @xmath3 , a formulation in terms of the coordination number  @xmath2 implies such a shift as well . at even higher order ,",
    "one finds ( at rational dimensionalities ) additional @xmath59 dependences , as was first recognized by thouless  @xcite .",
    "he has studied a modified form of the ising model , where the system is divided into cells within which the spin - spin interactions are constant .",
    "the shift of the critical temperature as a function of the cell size is then calculated by means of perturbation theory . in three dimensions ,",
    "the leading - order result of brout is recovered , namely a shift proportional to @xmath60 . in the next - to - leading term a logarithmic dependence on the coordination number",
    "is obtained , @xmath61 whereas for @xmath27 the logarithm emerges already in the leading term , @xmath62 the latter expression is in perfect agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : shift_2d ] ) , whereas the logarithm in the higher - order term in  ( [ eq : th_shift_3d ] ) has not been found in refs .",
    "@xcite . since the logarithms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : th_shift_3d ] ) and  ( [ eq : th_shift_2d ] ) apparently follow from the same mechanism and the factor @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shift_2d ] ) is specific for the two - dimensional case ( where all higher - order terms in the lgw hamiltonian are equally relevant ) , i conclude that there must be two different sources for the logarithms , which happen to yield the same effect in @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , the logarithms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : th_shift_3d ] ) and  ( [ eq : th_shift_2d ] ) arise from counter terms canceling the infrared divergences in the perturbation expansion .",
    "this appears to be intimately linked to the infrared divergences occurring in massless super - renormalizable field theories at rational dimensionalities  @xcite . actually , the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite _ does _ account for logarithmic factors in @xmath14 , although at much higher order . for systems with a large interaction range ,",
    "the first part of the renormalization trajectory passes close to the gaussian fixed point .",
    "near this fixed point , only the @xmath17 term is relevant for @xmath14 and all terms @xmath63 with @xmath64 are irrelevant .",
    "the marginal character of the @xmath65 term produces a logarithmic range dependence in the shift of the critical temperature .",
    "however , since this logarithm stems from the term quadratic in @xmath65 and the field @xmath66 is rescaled by a factor @xmath67 , this contribution is extremely weak .",
    "an actual calculation shows that it leads to a shift proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath65 term will yield a correction of order @xmath69 .",
    "however , it may be added that it is generally expected  @xcite that such high composite operators have very little influence near the ising fixed point .",
    "let me now briefly return to the leading shift @xmath48 obtained in ref .",
    "it is instructive to note that this shift is consistent with crossover arguments first given by riedel and wegner  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ginzburg criterion states that a crossover from classical to nonclassical critical behavior occurs as a function of the crossover parameter  @xmath70 . in terms of a more general formulation ,",
    "this parameter is written as @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the crossover exponent @xmath66 ( not to be confused with the field  @xmath66 ) , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is just the exponent @xmath26 of the relevant operator driving the system away from the gaussian fixed point ( i.e. , the @xmath17 term in the lgw hamiltonian ) , divided by the thermal exponent @xmath74 .",
    "then , on general grounds  @xcite , the shift of @xmath9 is predicted to scale as @xmath75 .",
    "this is another indication that the shift terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : th_shift_3d ] ) originate from a different , complementary mechanism .",
    "in addition , it is noted that the formulation in terms of the crossover exponent  @xmath66 can be carried even further  ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "indeed , for any thermodynamic quantity  @xmath76 which is near the ising critical point proportional to  @xmath77 , the combined dependence on @xmath78 and  @xmath79 will be @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the @xmath79 dependence of  @xmath76 near the gaussian fixed point . in terms of @xmath79 and  @xmath3 , this can be written as @xmath82 which yields , e.g. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , recovering eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mag - rangedep ] ) and  ( [ eq : chi - rangedep ] ) .",
    "i have carried out extensive simulations of 3d simple cubic lattices consisting of @xmath85 lattice sites with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "i have carried out simulations for all ranges @xmath99 .",
    "no systematic deviations could be observed .",
    "the actual simulations were carried out for systems up to @xmath100 ( 8  million spins ) ; the number of samples was chosen depending on the system size . as a rule of thumb",
    ", the amplitude ratio  @xmath101 ( to be defined below ) had a relative accuracy on the permille level for the largest systems .      in order to analyze the range dependence of several quantities , an accurate knowledge of the critical temperature for each single value of  @xmath86",
    "is required .",
    "the critical temperatures of systems with interaction ranges corresponding to the first thirteen neighbor shells have been determined using the amplitude ratio @xmath102 . for the 3d ising universality class and a cubic geometry with periodic boundary conditions , this quantity has , in the thermodynamic limit , the universal critical - point value @xmath103  @xcite . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , an accurate determination of the critical point is mainly hampered by the requirement that one must reach the ising limit , i.e. , @xmath104 . for the inner shells , the smallest system sizes that could be used in the finite - size analysis were of the same order as in an analysis of the 3d nearest - neighbor ising model , i.e. , @xmath105 . for the remaining shells , the smallest allowable system sizes , as determined from the quality of the least - squares fits , followed the restriction @xmath106 rather closely . only for the outermost shells",
    "this criterion could be slightly relaxed .",
    "thus , the accuracy of the fit results decreases considerably with increasing interaction range , because the finite - size data cover a much smaller range of system sizes and all the accurate results for small system sizes have to be excluded from the analysis .",

    "for @xmath3 large , @xmath133 should go to a finite constant and hence @xmath118 is expected to be proportional to @xmath134 in this limit .",
    "just as for most other quantities , it is difficult to accurately determine @xmath118 for large interaction ranges , because the small system sizes have to be omitted from the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the results shown in fig .  [ fig : asymcorr ] appear to be well compatible with the predicted @xmath3 dependence , with @xmath135 \\approx -0.14 $ ] ( the latter estimate relies on the assumption that the asymptotic limit has actually been reached for the largest ranges shown in the figure ) .",
    "unfortunately , no estimate for @xmath126 for either @xmath136 ( nearest - neighbor ising model ) or any other  @xmath3 is known to the author , so that the overall constant  @xmath132 [ which would have permitted the calculation of @xmath126 from @xmath137 can not be determined ( cf .",

    "on the other hand , an estimate of the interaction range where @xmath138 does not depend on  @xmath132 , and so it can be predicted with a reasonable accuracy that this condition is fulfilled at @xmath139 .",
    "the interest of this point lies in the fact that the leading corrections to scaling should vanish there , which in principle allows a much more accurate determination of critical properties from numerical simulations .",
    "this approach was used for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , amongst others , a spin-@xmath0 model with nearest - neighbor coupling  @xmath140 and third - neighbor coupling  @xmath141 was simulated .",
    "the ratio @xmath142 was set to 0.4 , which in hindsight proved to be somewhat too strong for fully suppressing the leading corrections to scaling .",
    "a newer estimate yielded @xmath143 as an optimal choice  @xcite .",
    "further studies of these systems were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the coupling constant ratio was systematically varied in order to eliminate the leading finite - size corrections .",
    "this lead to an estimate of @xmath144 .",
    "both estimates turn out to be in quite good agreement with my prediction for _ general _ interaction profiles . indeed , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : effrange ] ) , an effective interaction range @xmath145 can be obtained by , e.g. , nearest - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor interactions with @xmath146 or by nearest and third - neighbor interactions with @xmath147 .",
    "this also explains the finding of ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath148 had to be chosen much larger than @xmath141 to reach the same effect .    in this context",
    "it is of interest to review some series - expansion results for the leading correction amplitudes for the magnetization , the susceptibility , and the correlation length on simple cubic  ( sc ) , body - centered cubic  ( bcc ) , and face - centered cubic  ( fcc ) lattices .",
    "liu and fisher  @xcite concluded that the leading correction amplitudes are _ negative _ for the sc and bcc lattices and gave various arguments that this also holds for the fcc lattice .",
    "furthermore , they argue that these amplitudes should vanish monotonically with coordination number ( @xmath149 , respectively ) .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by the fact that the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymcorr ] _ monotonically _ approach the predicted asymptotic @xmath3 dependence , apart from statistical scatter .",
    "however , from the fact that for the sc lattice with @xmath6 ( @xmath150 ) the finite - size corrections have already changed sign , it would be expected that the correction amplitudes for the fcc lattice are close to zero .",
    "in contrast , both the results of george and rehr  @xcite and liu and fisher  @xcite , see table  [ tab : rehr ] , exhibit a relatively weak variation with coordination number . on the basis of these results",
    "one would certainly expect the leading corrections to vanish at much higher coordination numbers .",
    "thus , i conclude that , apart from the dependence on @xmath2 ( or  @xmath3 ) , the value of @xmath120 has a rather strong dependence on the lattice structure as well . for completeness , it may be remarked that the analyses of the monte carlo data for the magnetization density and the susceptibility have revealed the same monotonic @xmath3 dependence of the leading correction amplitude as that of the quantity  @xmath118 discussed above .",
    "the estimates for the critical coupling as given in table  [ tab : qfit ] can in principle be used to verify the predictions for the shift of the critical temperature .",
    "because lattice effects are still relatively strong for the interaction ranges studied here , the coordination number  @xmath2 , appearing in , e.g. , eq .  ( [ eq : th_shift_3d ] ) , can not be used directly .",
    "it is expected that these lattice effects disappear when the _ effective _ interaction range  @xmath3 is used instead .",
    "thus , the predicted shift is rewritten as : @xmath151 where i have used the inverse critical temperature to conform to the earlier literature . unfortunately , it turns out that even in terms of  @xmath3 the numerical data exhibit remarkably strong scatter for @xmath152 , making it impossible to obtain a sensible fit for the smaller interaction ranges . on the other hand , for @xmath153 ,",
    "( [ eq : tc_shift ] ) describes the data very well . because of the small variation of the @xmath59 term over the fit range , it was not possible to discern the coefficients @xmath154 and  @xmath155 .",
    "thus , i have omitted @xmath154 altogether , which implies that this coefficient is absorbed into an effective value of  @xmath155 .",
    "the resulting fit yielded the values @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 .",
    "clearly , the last two estimates suffer from the fact that ( for the available values of  @xmath3 ) the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc_shift ] ) lie quite close .",
    "thus , it can not be excluded that the high values of @xmath41 and  @xmath155 are partially caused by a mutual cancellation and that apart from the quoted statistical errors there is a considerable systematic error . nevertheless , as will be seen below ,",
    "the accuracy of the resulting expression is sufficient to obtain rather precise estimates for systems with larger interaction ranges .",
    "in fact , if the results for @xmath159 are also included in the least - squares fit and the lattice effects are simply ignored , an essentially phenomenological interpolation formula is obtained , which for larger ranges turns out to agree very well with the first fit .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , series - expansion estimates are given for the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath155 in  ( [ eq : tc_shift ] ) . in terms of an expansion in  @xmath2 , dalton and domb found the value  @xmath160 for the leading coefficient ( confusingly , in later work  @xcite the value  @xmath161 was quoted ) and for the prefactor of the logarithm thouless obtained @xmath162 . to compare these values to @xmath40 and  @xmath155 , i write @xmath163 .",
    "this yields @xmath164 and @xmath165 . in view of the various approximations that have been made ,",
    "the agreement for @xmath40 is truly remarkable . because of the above - mentioned cancellation effects and because of the omission of @xmath154 in the fit , a sensible comparison for @xmath155 is not possible .",

    "the critical couplings obtained from this analysis are in agreement with those shown in table  [ tab : qfit ] .",
    "the corresponding estimates for @xmath35 are listed in table  [ tab : mfit ] .",
    "the slight tendency of the estimates to decrease with increasing  @xmath3 , as well as the increasing uncertainties , can be explained from the requirement that the smallest system size included in the analysis must increase with  @xmath3 .",
    "when the analyses were repeated with the critical couplings fixed at the best values in table  [ tab : qfit ] , the agreement of the estimates for @xmath35 ( also shown in table  [ tab : mfit ] ) with the 3d  ising value @xmath169  @xcite was even better .",

    "this constant has been set to zero , because it tends to interfere with the leading irrelevant term @xmath181 . just as for the absolute magnetization density , i list estimates for the magnetic exponent @xmath35 ( table  [ tab : chifit ] ) .",
    "although , as expected , the uncertainty increases with  @xmath3 , one observes that all estimates agree with the ising value .",
    "also the critical couplings agree with those obtained from the fourth - order amplitude ratio and @xmath166 .",
    "thus , i have repeated all analyses with @xmath109 fixed ; the corresponding results for @xmath35 are shown in table  [ tab : chifit ] as well .",
    "finally , i have fixed the magnetic exponent at @xmath182 ( but included @xmath109 as a free parameter ) in order to obtain accurate estimates for @xmath183 ( table  [ tab : chifit ] ) . fitting",
    "a straight line @xmath184 to the last three values yielded a slope  @xmath185 , which is consistent with the prediction  @xmath186 [ eq .  ( [ eq : chi - fss ] ) ] .",

    "@xcite , knowledge of this dependence is very useful to determine the thermal crossover curve for the susceptibility ( which for @xmath190 is represented by  @xmath191 ) from data for different  @xmath3 , because it makes it possible to divide out the subleading range dependence of this curve . rather than giving the full details of the analysis ,",
    "i restrict myself to fig .",
    "[ fig : con ] , which shows the critical amplitudes together with the rg prediction fitted to it . instead of @xmath191 ,",
    "the so - called scaled susceptibility @xmath192 is often considered .",
    "it has been noted for the two - dimensional case  @xcite , that the latter quantity exhibits considerably stronger deviations from the asymptotic range dependence , which are caused by the shift of the critical temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : con ] confirms that this also holds for the three - dimensional case .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the critical properties of the equivalent - neighbor models obtained in the previous section can now be used to find the finite - size crossover scaling functions describing the crossover from a finite mean - field - like system to a finite ising - like system at @xmath193 .",
    "a detailed description of this phenomenon has been given in ref .",
    "qualitatively this crossover can simply be understood from the observation that systems with a linear size of the order of the interaction range are essentially mean - field - like systems , which are turned into systems with a short - range interaction if the system size grows beyond the interaction range .",
    "rg considerations have shown that the crossover is ruled by a generalized ginzburg parameter @xmath194 , so that the mean - field regime corresponds to @xmath195 and the ising regime to @xmath196 .",
    "the expression for  @xmath197 has also been obtained in ref .",
    "it is numerically not feasible to observe the entire crossover regime in a system with fixed  @xmath3 by merely varying the system size , since it spans several decades in the parameter  @xmath197 .",
    "thus , i construct the crossover curve by combining the results for various interaction ranges , just as this has been done for the two - dimensional case in ref .",
    "@xcite and for the three - dimensional thermal crossover in ref .",
    "since it turns out that for @xmath198 the curves are affected by nonlinear finite - size effects , the smallest value of the crossover parameter that can be reached with the interaction ranges studied in the previous two sections is @xmath199 .",
    "the true mean - field regime , however , is only reached for _ much _ smaller  @xmath200 .",
    "thus , i have carried out simulations for systems with effective interaction ranges up to @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) , corresponding to coordination numbers as large as @xmath203 . evidently , the monte carlo algorithm introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite comes to its full glory here : the simulation of three - dimensional systems with so many interactions present would not have been feasible with either a metropolis - type algorithm or a conventional cluster - building algorithm .",
    "the actual crossover curves shown below are obtained from a combination of the data for @xmath177 , with system sizes between @xmath95 and  @xmath100 , and additional data for 20 different interaction ranges @xmath204 . for the latter systems ,",
    "the critical coupling was determined using the extrapolation formula discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tc_shift ] and subsequently simulations were carried out for @xmath205 at each single value of @xmath206 .    an additional complication is formed by the regime @xmath196 .",
    "whereas this part of the crossover curve can easily be reached by simulating large system sizes with very small interaction ranges , higher - order range dependences prevent the direct use of these data for the construction of crossover curves .",
    "it was recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite that these are the same corrections that are responsible for the deviations from the asymptotic range dependence in figs .",
    "[ fig : mabs ] , [ fig : chi ] , and  [ fig : con ] , so that this effect can be removed by dividing the magnetization density by the factor in brackets in eq .",

    "[ fig : mcross ] .",
    "it is immediately clear that the data lie on a perfectly smooth curve , confirming that the crossover is indeed ruled by the generalized ginzburg parameter  @xmath197 .",

    "ranges this correction factor rapidly approaches unity . in the graph",
    "i have included a line with slope @xmath215 , indicating the dependence on  @xmath197 in the ising regime . whereas no exact result exists for the finite - size amplitude of this asymptote , it is possible to calculate its counterpart in the mean - field regime , where it is found that  @xcite @xmath216 thus , @xmath212 should approach  @xmath217 in the limit @xmath218 .",
    "one indeed observes that the leftmost data points in the graph lie already very close to this limit .",
    "together with the collapse of all numerical data onto a single curve , this also indicates that the simulations for systems with large interaction ranges indeed have been carried out at the correct temperatures ; i.e. , the extrapolation formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc_shift ] ) has yielded sufficiently accurate estimates for the critical temperatures for @xmath204 . for the sake of clarity",
    ", it is stressed that for each single value of  @xmath3 , the simulations of the finite systems have been carried out at the critical temperature of a system with that particular interaction range in the thermodynamic limit .    as a side remark",
    ", i note that a much more sensitive description of the crossover can be formulated in terms of so - called `` effective exponents ''",

    "@xcite ) and more recently also in the analysis of numerical results , cf .",

    "this directly related to the violation of hyperscaling in the mean - field regime and can be explained from the dangerous - irrelevant - variable mechanism  @xcite .",

    "no nonlinear finite - size effects can be observed , suggesting that these are ( on the scale of the graph ) negligibly small for @xmath229 .      rather than reproducing crossover curves for the connected susceptibility or the spin - spin correlation function , which are very similar to those presented in the previous two subsections , i prefer to pay some attention to the crossover of the amplitude ratio  @xmath101 .",
    "this quantity , which is just a disguised form of the fourth - order cumulant introduced by binder  @xcite , attains trivial limiting values on either side of the critical temperature , but takes a nontrivial universal value at criticality .",

    "also renormalization - group predictions for the variation of the finite - size corrections with interaction range have been confirmed and an estimate has been obtained for the effective interaction range at which the leading finite - size corrections should vanish .",
    "the numerical results support the expectation that the @xmath17  coefficient in the landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian varies monotonically with interaction range ( or coordination number ) and scales for large ranges as  @xmath127 .",

    "<S> in addition , the analysis yields an estimate for the interaction range at which the leading corrections to scaling vanish for the spin-@xmath0 model and confirms earlier conclusions that the leading wegner correction must be negative for the three - dimensional ( nearest - neighbor ) ising model . by complementing these results with monte carlo data for systems with coordination numbers as large as  @xmath1 , </S>",
