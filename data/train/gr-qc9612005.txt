    "the classical singularity theorems by hawking and penrose @xcite predict that in a physically reasonable model of space - time , singularities will inevitably occur in the form of incomplete , inextendible causal geodesics .",

    "one would expect some sort of divergence of the curvature when approaching a singularity .",
    "more precisely , we might expect divergence of some scalar polynomial in the riemann tensor and the metric along an incomplete curve ending at the singularity , or equivalently that the riemann tensor components are unbounded in _ all _ frames along the curve .",
    "there are however singular space - times where the scalar polynomials are bounded , i.e.  there exists some frame where the riemann tensor components are bounded , along an incomplete inextendible causal curve . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on space - times containing b - incomplete causal curves partially imprisoned in a compact set .",
    "the existence of imprisoned curves is equivalent to the existence of a cluster point to some causal curve , and thus implies a non - hausdorff behaviour of the b - completion .",

    "if we endow a neighbourhood of @xmath5 with a continuous frame field we find that the tangent vector to one of the spiralling incomplete curves are boosted by an unbounded amount relative to the frame field as the curve approaches @xmath5 .",
    "the reason that the riemann components remain bounded along the curve is that the riemann tensor is highly specialised in this case , and it is likely that the situation is unstable because of the back reaction of test particle travelling along the curve.@xcite    indeed one can show that a b - boundary point @xmath9 corresponding to an inextendible incomplete causal curve @xmath10 must be a p.p .",
