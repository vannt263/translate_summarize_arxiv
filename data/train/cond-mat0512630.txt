    "numerous heterospin chain compounds have been synthesized along this line .",
    "gleizes and verdaguer @xcite made an attempt to alternate two types of metal ion along one crystallographic axis with antiferromagnetic intrachain interaction and obtained a pioneering example of quasi - one - dimensional ferrimagnets , of formula @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",

    ", @xcite proved to be a quasi - one - dimensional mixed - spin ferromagnet @xcite and caused renewed interest in mixed - spin chains .",
    "@xcite calculated the spin density distribution by means of the density functional theory and quantitatively visualized the ferromagnetic nature of the mn(ii)-ni(ii ) interaction .",

    "the acoustic excitations reduce the ground - state magnetization and are thus of ferromagnetic nature , while the optical excitations enhance the ground - state magnetization and are thus of antiferromagnetic nature . in the case of ferromagnetic coupling , on the other hand , both excitations are of ferromagnetic character .",
    "therefore , the schottky - type peak of the specific heat and the minimum of the susceptibility - temperature product , which are both ferrimagnetic features , are absent from mixed - spin ferromagnets . nevertheless , mixed - spin ferromagnets and ferrimagnets behave similarly at low temperatures , which is the goal of this paper . employing a quantum monte carlo method @xcite and a modified spin - wave theory , @xcite we investigate thermodynamis of one - dimensional alternating - spin heisenberg ferromagnets with particular emphasis on the intrinsic low - temperature properties",

    "@xcite as for the thermal quantities , however , the low - temperature series expansion within the conventional scheme @xcite only reproduces the leading term of the specific heat and nothing correct for the magnetic susceptibility .",
