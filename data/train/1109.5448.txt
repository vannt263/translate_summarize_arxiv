    "large hadron collider ( lhc ) has started setting the strong constraints on the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , the key particle responsible for the origin of mass in the context of the sm .",
    "the recent data from the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments suggest that the sm higgs boson is unlikely for the mass range as low as the electroweak ( ew ) scale , which may suggest that there might exist certain composite dynamics for the origin of mass due to the strongly coupled theories like technicolor ( tc )  @xcite .",
    "actually , in contrast to the original tc  @xcite , a higgs - like object , techni - dilaton ( td ) , was predicted as a composite scalar , a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) associated with the spontaneously broken approximate scale symmetry in the walking tc ( wtc ) , initially dubbed `` scale - invariant tc ''  @xcite . thus clarifying the td signature at lhc is the urgent task in searching for higgs - like particle at the ongoing lhc , which is the target of this paper .",
    "the original version of tc  @xcite , a naive scale - up version of qcd , was dead due to the excessive flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "a solution to the fcnc problem was soon suggested by simply assuming the existence of a large anomalous dimension without any concrete dynamics and concrete value of the anomalous dimension  @xcite .",
    "it was the wtc  @xcite that gave a concrete dynamics , ladder schwinger - dyson ( lsd ) equation with _ non - running _",
    "( _ scale invariant / conformal _ ) gauge coupling , @xmath12 , giving rise to a concrete value of the anomalous dimension , @xmath13 at criticality @xmath14 . actually , once the mass @xmath15 of the techni - fermion ( @xmath16 ) is dynamically generated , the coupling becomes _ running slowly ( `` walking '' ) _ a la miransky  @xcite , with the _ nonperturbative _ beta function @xmath17 .",
    "( subsequently , a similar fcnc solution based on the ( _ perturbatively _ ) walking coupling was discussed without concept of anomalous dimension  @xcite . )",
    "this may also be improved in the wtc  @xcite . even if wtc in isolation can not overcome this problem ,",
    "there still exist a possibility that the problem may be resolved in the combined dynamical system including the sm fermion mass generation such as the extended tc ( etc ) dynamics  @xcite , in much the same way as the solution ( `` ideal fermion delocalization '' )  @xcite in the higgsless models which simultaneously adjust s and t parameters by incorporating the sm fermion mass profile . ]    in view of the approximate scale symmetry reflected by the _ nonperturbative _ walking coupling associated with the dynamical generation of @xmath15 , the wtc predicted the td  @xcite , a light scalar @xmath18 composite as a pngb associated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate scale symmetry triggered by the dynamical generation of @xmath15 or the techni - fermion condensate .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the tc as a simple scale - up of the qcd where the coupling is _ running already at perturbative level _ with the scale symmetry badly broken at @xmath19 , so that there is no scale symmetry to be broken by the dynamical fermion mass generation and hence no scalar spectrum lighter than the typical hadronic scale , say the rho meson   resonance , in the real - life qcd , which however may not be a two - body composite of @xmath20 which is an analogue of td but may be mainly a four - body composite .",
    "such a situation of the real - life qcd is an accidental consequence of specific values @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite . ] .",
    "the mass generation due to such a scale invariant ( conformal ) dynamics takes the form of essential - singularity scaling , miransky scaling  @xcite , and can be characterized by the `` _ conformal phase transition _ ''  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that even if the gauge coupling is non - running ( scale invariant ) in the _ perturbative _ sense as in the case of the lsd equation , the scale symmetry is actually _ broken explicitly for the very reason of the spontaneous breaking itself _ , namely the dynamical generation of the techni - fermion mass @xmath15 , which is responsible for the _ nonperturbative _ running of the coupling ( _ nonperturbative _ scale anomaly ) as mentioned above .",
    "accordingly , the td can not be massless even if we use a _ perturbatively _ non - running ( scale invariant ) coupling in the lsd equation .",
    "actually , various old calculations  @xcite imply @xmath23 , still smaller , though not extremely smaller , than masses of other techni - hadrons .",
    "modern version of wtc  @xcite is based on the two - loop running coupling with the caswell - banks - zaks infrared fixed point ( cbz - irfp )  @xcite , instead of the non - running one , in the improved lsd equation .",
    "there also exists an intrinsic scale @xmath24 analogous to @xmath19 , which breaks the scale symmetry already at two - loop perturbative level for the ultraviolet region @xmath25 ( taken to be @xmath26 ) where the coupling runs in the same way as in qcd .",
    "however this _ perturbative _ scale - symmetry - breaking scale @xmath24 is irrelevant to the dynamical mass @xmath15 and so is the td mass @xmath0 , both can be @xmath27 thanks to the cbz - irfp .",
    "indeed , it has recently been argued @xcite and explicitly shown  @xcite in the case of the two - loop perturbative coupling that we have essentially the same conclusion as the non - running case in the above , @xmath28 , in sharp contrast to the recent claim on much smaller mass @xmath29  @xcite   as @xmath30 , which is irrelevant to lhc experiments , although it might be relevant to dark matter  @xcite . ] .",
    "namely , the dynamical generation of @xmath15 triggers spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry which is also _ explicitly broken by @xmath15 _ through the _ nonperturbative running _ coupling ( _ nonperturbative scale anomaly _ ) again a la miransky . at any rate the approximate scale symmetry is crucial for the mass of td to be lighter than other techni - hadrons like techni - rho meson with the mass @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "more concretely , it was noted  @xcite that several earlier nonperturbative calculations of the scalar mass in different contexts can be interpreted as those for the estimate of td mass  @xcite : @xmath33 , which would suggest the td mass as low as @xmath34 ( one - family model ) , well within the reach of lhc searches .",
    "this is also consistent with the recent holographic estimate  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "( the above estimate would suggest @xmath35 for the one - doublet model , barely within the lhc search region )  .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the characteristic signature of td at the lhc , calculating the relevant decay widths and production cross sections in comparison with those of the sm higgs . to set definite benchmarks , we employ typical models of tc  @xcite such as the one - doublet model ( 1 dm )   since in this case @xmath36 .",
    "] and one - family model ( 1fm ) in the light of wtc .",
    "the td couplings to the sm particles are derived based on nonlinear realization of both scale and chiral symmetries , which becomes highly nontrivial since the scale symmetry , in contrast to the chiral symmetry , is broken explicitly as well as spontaneously due to the dynamical mass generation of the techni - fermion @xmath15 , leading to the nonperturbative scale anomaly as mentioned above .",
    "there is no limit where td becomes exactly massless .",
    "thus the nonlinear realization of the scale symmetry must properly include the explicit breaking at the same time as the spontaneous breaking , which we will do via spurion field method , the method familiar in the chiral perturbation theory incorporating the current quark mass term  @xcite .",
    "then the td couplings are given as functions of the techni - fermion mass @xmath15 , the td decay constant @xmath37 ( or td yukawa coupling ) and the td mass @xmath0 up to the number of tc @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath37 may be written in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath15 through the the partially conserved dilatation current ( pcdc ) for the trace anomaly ( nonperturbative scale anomaly ) reflecting the spontaneous and explicit breaking of the scale symmetry due to dynamical generation of @xmath15 , and @xmath15 may be written in terms of the weak scale @xmath39 through the pagels - stokar ( ps ) formula  @xcite .",
    "hence we can estimate all the quantities only in terms of the td mass @xmath0 as a free parameter which we take in a wide region @xmath40 gev around the reference value 600 gev in eq.([600 ] ) suggested by the various calculations  @xcite . in order to do a concrete estimate we adopt a recent result of the nonperturbative scale anomaly  @xcite based on the lsd analysis with the two - loop beta function of large @xmath41 qcd having the cbz - irfp  @xcite .",
    "the result is not qualitatively changed ( see the discussion in the last section ) if we employ the non - running coupling in the lsd as in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we then explicitly evaluate the lhc production cross sections of td at @xmath2 tev , @xmath42 , times the td branching ratios , for the td mass range taken within the lhc search region @xmath40 gev .",
    "we find that the td signatures are quite different from those of the sm higgs : for 1dms all those cross sections get suppressed compared to the corresponding quantities for the sm higgs due to the suppression of the gluon fusion cross section coming from the large suppression of td couplings , while for 1fms they get highly enhanced since the production cross section has huge extra contributions from the extra colored fermions ( techni - quarks ) . as a check of consistency with the current lhc data ,",
    "we compare the cross section @xmath43 normalized to the corresponding quantity for the sm higgs with the recent bounds from the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments  .",
    "it turns out that in the case of 1dms the signature is consistent with the current experimental data over the whole region we study thanks to the large suppression of td couplings , and by the same token the signal is too tiny to be visible through this channel at lhc . as for the 1fms ,",
    "on the other hand , the td mass is constrained to be excluded up till @xmath1 gev , which , however , would imply occurrence of somewhat large excess at @xmath7 1000 gev in this channel to be seen in the future experiments .",
    "we further calculate the cross section @xmath44 and predict it to be @xmath45 fb at @xmath2 tev for the td mass around 600 gev in the typical 1fms .",
    "this cross section is comparable with the golden mode of the sm higgs @xmath46 , and hence is large enough for the td to be discovered within the first few year s run at the lhc .",

    "the blob denoted as @xmath49 in the right panel corresponds to an etc - induced four fermi vertex @xmath50 .",
    "[ yukawa : fig ] ]    in this section we shall derive the td couplings to the sm particles and address their forms .",
    "we focus on the couplings to @xmath51 and @xmath52 to make the explicit comparison with those of the sm higgs .",
    "the td yukawa couplings to the techni - fermion @xmath53 and those to the sm fermions @xmath47 were actually derived long time ago  @xcite through the ward - takahashi identity for dilatation current coupled with td , corresponding to the diagrams depicted in fig .",

    "it may require other dynamics such as the top quark condensate  @xcite .",
    "however , it was found  @xcite that if we include additional four - fermion interactions like strong etc , the anomalous dimension becomes much larger @xmath60 , which can boost the etc - origin mass to arbitrarily large up till the techni - fermion mass scale ( `` strong etc model '' ) .",
    "subsequently the same effects were also noted without concept of the anomalous dimension  @xcite . ] .",
    "here we work on nonlinear realization of both the scale and chiral symmetries to derive a nonlinear lagrangian which directly yields the various td couplings to the sm particles . actually , the resultant lagrangian _ should not be invariant _ under the scale symmetry because it is broken by techni - fermion mass generation explicitly as well as spontaneously as was emphasized above .",
    "we therefore incorporate such an inherent explicit - breaking effects ( nonperturbative scale anomaly ) arising from the dynamical mass generation itself by introducing a spurion field in a familiar manner  @xcite , which will provide us with a direct way to read appropriate couplings of td .",
    "we begin by introducing a dynamical variable @xmath61 which reflects the scale transformation property of the techni - fermion bilinear @xmath56 ( @xmath62 ) , analogously to the usual chiral field @xmath63 reflecting the chiral transformation property of @xmath64 , so that @xmath61 transforms under the scale symmetry as @xmath65 we parametrize this @xmath61 with the td field @xmath66 and the decay constant @xmath37 as @xmath67 where @xmath37 is defined as @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the dilatation current composed _ only of the tc sector fields_. from eq.([trans : phi ] ) it follows that the td field @xmath66 transforms nonlinearly under the scale symmetry : @xmath70    to incorporate the explicit - breaking effects due to the nonperturbative scale anomaly of the tc sector , we introduce a spurion field @xmath71 which transforms under the scale symmetry with the scale dimension 1 : @xmath72 its vacuum expectation value @xmath73 thus breaks the scale symmetry explicitly .",

    "the td couplings are similar to those of the sm higgs except the overall scale set by the td decay constant ( and the anomalous dimension ) instead of the ew scale .",
    "we took typical models of wtc such as 1 dm and 1fm to make an explicit estimate of the branching ratios and production cross sections . to be more concrete",

    "the td lhc signatures were then discussed by explicitly calculating the production cross sections times the branching ratios in comparison with the corresponding quantities for the sm higgs .",
    "it turned out that the td signatures look like quite different from the corresponding sm higgs signatures : for 1dms , all the td signatures become one order of magnitude down compared with those of the sm higgs , which would imply that if the higgs - like object was found in the region above 600 gev , it would be naturally interpreted as td , since the sm higgs unlikely has such a large mass . on the other hand , for 1fms all those signatures were shown to be enhanced by a factor of @xmath205 and would become outstanding signals of td ( see table  [ list : signals ] ) .",

    "[ lhcsignature1 ] ) .",

    "[ lhcsignature2 ] and eq.([tdgammagamma : signal ] ) ) .",
    "this cross section is large enough for the td to be discovered in the upcoming several months and hence will also be a characteristic signature of td .",
    "+ before closing this section , several comments are in order : + _ td lhc signature from the @xmath118 mode _  first of all , it is worth commenting on the td lhc signature through the decay to @xmath118 .",
    "the atlas at @xmath2 tev with the integrated luminosity of @xmath210 fb@xmath211 has already measured the @xmath118 production cross section @xmath212 to report that @xmath213 pb  @xcite , in agreement with the sm prediction .",
    "the sm higgs contribution to this cross section is estimated to be about 0.1 pb at around the mass @xmath11 gev and hence is negligible in comparison with the dominant qcd contributions incorporated in the sm estimate of @xmath212 .",
    "as seen from table  [ list : signals ] , on the other hand , the cross section @xmath214 in the case of 1fms gets enhanced by a factor of about 30 ( 70 ) for @xmath215(3 ) with @xmath189 gev compared to the sm higgs case , so we would have @xmath216 pb .",
    "thus this signature is currently just as much as the size of the measurement uncertainties , but would be testable if more precise measurement of @xmath212 becomes possible in the future .",
    "+ _ perturbative unitarity _",
    " for the 1fms we might put an upper limit on @xmath0 coming from the perturbative unitarity bound through a formula , @xmath217  @xcite . by this formula",
    "we get @xmath218 gev for the 1fms , while it is absent for the 1dms because the bound is estimated to be above 1 tev .",
    "looking at figs .",
    "[ lhcsignature1 ] and [ lhcsignature2 ] with this unitarity bound taken into account , one might think that the 1fms have completely been ruled out ( up to the narrow window @xmath219 ) .",
    "note however that the perturbative unitarity bound is thought of as just a reference , which may not make much sense , since wtc is itself of course unitary and the low - energy effective theory is still strongly coupled and not perturbative .",
    "+ _ comparison with other dilaton phenomenology  @xcite _  another approach on a dilaton signature at the lhc has been addressed in ref .",
    "their dilaton is , however , completely different from our td in the sense that theirs is not due to the scale symmetry of the wtc but the whole system including sm and the underlying ew theory ( possibly including the wtc ) .",
    "thus the characteristic feature is completely different from ours .",
    "+ _ non - running coupling case _",
    " in this paper we employed lsd calculation of the nonperturbative scale anomaly via vacuum energy , using the two - loop running coupling with cbz - irfp in ref .",
    "we here discuss the comparison with the non - running limit . in this limit",
    "the very origin of the dynamical mass @xmath15 comes from the cutoff @xmath220 , the relation ( hierarchy ) between the two being given in the characteristic form of essential singularity ( miransky scaling )  @xcite : @xmath221 the coupling @xmath164 should depend on @xmath222 in such a way that @xmath223 in the limit @xmath224 , resultant beta function being @xmath225 .",
    "hence the cutoff can not be removed without requiring _ nonperturbative running _ of the coupling : the coupling ( non - running in the perturbative sense ) does actually run slowly ( walking ) towards the critical coupling ( regarded as the ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point ) at @xmath226 , reflecting the scale anomaly , i.e. , explicit breaking of the scale symmetry ( see figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) in the first of ref .",
    "@xcite for the beta function ( a ) and the associated anomalous dimension ( b ) ) .",
    "now in the wtc model based on the two - loop coupling with cbz - irfp , the role of the cutoff @xmath220 in the non - running case of the original wtc model  @xcite is simply traded for the intrinsic scale @xmath227 of the two - loop coupling , which breaks the scale symmetry already at perturbative level for the uv region ( @xmath25 ) where the coupling runs as @xmath228 as in the ordinary qcd .",
    "although in the ir region ( @xmath229 ) the coupling governed by cbz - irfp is almost non - running ( scale invariant / conformal ) , the scale symmetry is broken both spontaneously and explicitly by yet another dynamics , namely the dynamical generation of the techni - fermion mass @xmath230 , and the coupling does run according to the nonperturbative renormalization a la miransky in much the same way as the nonperturbative running of the non - running coupling case mentioned above .",
    "it was argued  @xcite that for the dynamical mass generation of essential singularity type scaling eq.([miransky ] ) , characterized as `` conformal phase transition '' , the associated nonperturbative scale anomaly ( explicit breaking of the scale symmetry ) is saturated by the pseudo dilaton ( `` massive dilaton '' ) which are dictated by the pcdc .    although the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite was done for the case @xmath231 , we may take a choice @xmath232 , in which case the wtc would simply be reduced to the original wtc model of ref .",
    "@xcite where the two - loop perturbative coupling becomes essentially scale invariant ( non - running ) all the way up to @xmath233  , since then the theory will be changed already at lower scale @xmath234 into a different theory , etc ( or the preon model where sm particles and techni - fermions are the composites on the same footing  @xcite ) . ] .",
    "in such a case the estimate of the scale anomaly through the vacuum energy was done long time ago  @xcite which differs from eq.([scaleanomaly ] ) only by the factor 0.81 in place of 0.76 .",
    "thus our estimate in the text would be qualitatively the same as it stands : in fact , the estimated values of @xmath15 and @xmath37 in eqs.([mf ] ) and ( [ ftd ] ) will be shifted upward only by about 5% in the case of the non - running coupling .",
    "this happens because of about 5% reduction and enhancement of the overall numerical coefficients in eqs.([ps ] ) and ( [ pcdc ] ) , respectively : 0.41 @xmath235 0.39 in eq.([ps ] ) , while 3.0 @xmath235 3.2 in eq.([pcdc ] ) .",
    "the yukawa couplings will then get smaller than those listed in table  [ list ] by a factor of about 17% , so the gf cross sections will be reduced by about 30% at around @xmath189 gev .",
    "the amount of td lhc signatures will thus be reduced only by about 30% compared to those predicted in figs .",
    "[ lhcsignature1 ] and [ lhcsignature2 ] and will not substantially change .",
