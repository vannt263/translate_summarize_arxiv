    "electrified automotive powertrain technology is being greatly developed as an increasingly number of carmakers wish to adopt vehicles with an electrification of the powertrain as a viable solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide to meet stringer regulative legislation and consumers demand .",
    "there is a strong effort of major constructors in order to deploy fully electric vehicles ( evs ) as early as possible in some car market segments .",
    "this work focus on a specific class of evs , namely , range extender electric vehicles ( reev ) .",
    "this study aims at synthesizing a supervising optimal control strategy of the range extender ( re ) using information from the vehicle navigation system ( nav ) as well as a statistical analysis of previously stored driving data .",
    "one important feature of this study is the incorporation of two re s physical constraints  the execution lag and the decision delay  in the optimal control problem formulation . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the system is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system in which discrete decisions may suffer from an execution delay and a decision lag .",
    "the next step is the formulation of a stochastic optimal control problem in this hybrid framework alongside a stochastic dynamic programming principle which is then used to obtain an optimal controller . in the literature , there are several works that deal with the synthesis of optimal  or sub - optimal  supervisory control strategies for a vehicle with a certain degree of hybridization .",
    "these works include heuristics such as model - based @xcite or fuzzy logic algorithms @xcite .",
    "attention is also given to adaptive control techniques @xcite .",
    "works @xcite , @xcite use stochastic dynamic programming algorithms to synthesize control strategies that are not cycle - specific but do not include any information from the navigation system .",
    "this study seeks to synthesize an optimal control sequence of the ice in order to minimize an economic cost criteria related to overall energy consumption . in this case ,",
    "a rather realistic scenario is that there is no precise information about how the vehicle will behave ",
    "i.e. what its power demand will be  on a particular trip , even if there is some information available from a navigation system .",
    "many modern control systems involve some high - level logical decision making process coupled with underlying low - level continuous processes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "some of those are flight control systems , production systems , chemical processes and traffic management systems .",
    "the term hybrid stems from the different nature of the systems evolution , continuous and discrete .",
    "hybrid systems have some supervision logic that intervenes punctually between two or more continuous functions . an important share of this research seeks to extend the well known theory of continuous systems - for instance , the maximum principle @xcite , @xcite and the dynamic programming principle @xcite - to hybrid systems .",
    "several authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite propose different modeling frameworks for hybrid dynamical systems varying in degree of generality .",
    "this study bases itself on the quite general framework @xcite .",
    "many of the applications appearing in the literature can be viewed as their particular cases .",
    "works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite make considerable effort towards modeling and simulating hybrid dynamical systems in both deterministic and stochastic cases .",
    "continuous hybrid systems including decision lags and executions delays are studied in @xcite , @xcite where a suitable treatment is given to describe these systems .",
    "the contribution of this article is the use of a stochastic speed model in an optimal hybrid control framework , incorporating nav information , that integrates the re s activation delay and decision lag constraints .",
    "this section discusses the model of the power management system of a reev that is to be optimized and introduces the notation used throughout the document .",
    "a reev is a vehicle that combines a primary power source - a hv battery - and a small dimensioned ( powerwise ) secondary power source - in our case an ice .",
    "the traction ( or propulsion ) of the vehicle is performed by an electric motor connected to the vehicle s wheels .",
    "both power sources may supply the energy demanded by the driver .",
    "additionally , since the model considers a range - extender electric vehicle type , it can not rely solely on the re s power to drive the vehicle .",
    "the architecture is that of a series hybrid electric vehicle , which means that the ice is not mechanically connected to the transmission .",
    "instead , a generator transforms the mechanical energy produced in the ice into electric current that can be directed towards the electric motor or charge the battery .",
    "also , the powertrain components are represented by a quasi - static models , detailed in @xcite , thus neglecting any transient response .",
    "controls available include the turning on and off of the ice and the power produced in it . due the discrete nature of the switch on / off control and the continuous nature off the power control ,",
    "the control variable is seen as a hybrid control .",
    "the controlled variables are the state of charge ( soc ) of the battery and the ice state on or off .",
    "a power management strategy ( pms ) for a reev is a control sequence that dictates the state of the ice - on or off - and if it is on , how much power it will supply to the electric motor .",
    "the instant soc evolution depends on the vehicle s instant power demand . to devise efficient pmss ,",
    "the control synthesizer needs information about future power demands of the system as close as possible to the real power demand to be requested .",
    "hence , given a fixed route , since the control synthesizer does not rely on exact before - drive speed knowledge , the pms must be robust enough to `` absorb '' most of the situations occurring in a real driving cycle . in this case",
    "presented here , it contains information about possible deviations from the speed suggested by the nav .",
    "the nav outputs useful information is in the form of a geographic route .",
    "after the driver has entered a geographic location as a destination point in the nav , it suggests a route , calculated using some optimization algorithm .",
    "a working hypothesis is that the vehicle will follow this route suggested by the nav .",
    "the route is an assemblage of links , all of which have an associated constant recommended cruise speed .",
    "the route segmentation is used as discretization of the optimal control problem .",
    "the index @xmath0 refers to route links nodes .",
    "each link has an entry point and an exit point , thus , for a route with @xmath1 links we have @xmath2 nodes .",
    "index @xmath3 indexes a variable at a link s entry node .",
    "then , at the @xmath3-th link s entry point , one has the battery soc @xmath4 , the vehicle instant speed @xmath5 and the ice state @xmath6 . in the same manner",
    ", the ice controls will be applied at each link entrance , denoted by @xmath7 , the ice power , and @xmath8 , the ice on / off switch decision .",
    "each link s speed depends on particular characteristics of the route segment considered , such as type , number of lanes , location and may be dynamic , depending on weather conditions or the hour of the day . the speed profile formed with the speed suggested for each route link the _ nav speed profile_. as a result of the disparity between the real driving speed - not known _ a priori _ - and the nav speed profile , the knowledge on how much power will be instantaneously required by the vehicle in a car trip is not known .",
    "let @xmath9 be the  finite and discrete  set of possible nav properties values , consisting for instance of number of lanes , location and hour of the day .",
    "then , for a property set @xmath10 , let @xmath11 be the space of possible vehicle speeds .",
    "for example , if @xmath12 corresponds to a @xmath13 lanes link located on a freeway at @xmath14 p.m. , one possible speed set may be @xmath15 . for a fixed @xmath12 , let @xmath16 be a @xmath17-algebra over @xmath11 and @xmath18 a probability .",
    "then , we define @xmath19 to be a random variable over the probability space @xmath20  we denote by @xmath21 the random variable and its particular realization , the utilization will be clear from the context . given two sets of properties @xmath22 ( representing two neighboring links ) and two speed values @xmath23 , @xmath24 , we wish to define the probability of changing to speed @xmath25 from speed @xmath26 .",
    "it is natural to consider that the transition probability from @xmath26 to @xmath25 depends on @xmath12 and @xmath27 . for all @xmath22",
    ", we define a transition probability @xmath28 between @xmath26 and @xmath25 to be @xmath29 .",
    "such properties should be tailored to contain relevant useful information .",
    "for instance , one may not need to consider time frames @xmath30 apart , whereas a distinction between rush hours and lower traffic periods might be a more interesting choice .",
    "this section explains the motivation of including the execution delay and the decision lag constraints in the model , as well as the method used to incorporate these constraints in the optimal hybrid control problem .",
    "frequent switching of the re is undesirable in order to avoid mechanical wear off of the re and acoustic nuisance for the driver .",
    "decision lags impose that some minimum time is to be respected before turning the re on and thus , avoid this issues .",
    "also , the re ability of delivering power to the vehicle s hv network is constrained by the catalytic converter s temperature .",
    "indeed , the catalytic converter present in the ice s exhaust pipe must undergo a warm - up period in order to achieve a satisfactory working point .",
    "while this is not the case , the re must avoid functioning in any working point different than the minimal one  required for not stalling  and thus , can not provide any auxiliary power to the system .",
    "the activation delay models that behavior . in this application ,",
    "however distinct in nature , the decision lag and the execution delay have the same order of magnitude of about @xmath31 .",
    "thus , they are conveniently regrouped in only one delay / lag constant variable @xmath32 , expressed in time units .",
    "these constraints are introduced through a state variable at each link entry point , @xmath33 $ ] , representing a counting time since the last turn - re - on decision . in a nutshell , if @xmath34 , no switches are available to the controller and no power can be issued from the re .",
    "whenever @xmath35 , switches are available and the re can provide auxiliary power to the vehicle .      a hybrid state is a state vector consisting of continuous as well as discrete valued variables .",
    "the continuous variables are the battery soc @xmath36 $ ] , the vehicle instant speed @xmath37 $ ] and the counting time @xmath33 $ ] , and the discrete variable is the ice state @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the hybrid state space and @xmath40 be the hybrid state at each link s entry point .",
    "let @xmath8 be the discrete control applied to the system at link @xmath3 .",
    "the discrete controls are used to switch between continuous modes of the hybrid system .",
    "they are valued in a discrete set @xmath41 in the case of a two mode system .",
    "the control @xmath42 means no particular order , simply leaving whatever mode is on active , while @xmath43 represents a mode switch .",
    "we recall that only off@xmath44on transitions are delayed in time .",
    "mode transitions are decided at link @xmath3 but are executed afterwards and between its decision and execution instants , no other switch order can be decided .",
    "continuous controls @xmath7 are valued in a continuous set @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be the hybrid control valued in @xmath47 , the hybrid control space .",
    "the control sequence @xmath48 is an _ admissible hybrid control sequence _ if it satisfies the relations @xmath49 for @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 let @xmath53 be the set of links in which a switch decision is made .",

    "@xmath56 @xmath57 .",
    "[ admissiblecontrol ]    the first condition states that every hybrid control should be in the hybrid control domain .",
    "the second condition is the decision lag whereas the third one implies that no order that suffers from an execution delay can be decided and not executed . for a hybrid state @xmath58 ,",
    "we can write the control space as follows : @xmath59      this section describes the evolution equations of the state vector components from a known value @xmath60 at link @xmath3 .",
    "the speed on the next link is a random variable @xmath61 .",
    "the soc evolution depends on the power produced by the ice @xmath7 and @xmath62 , as well as on @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the time since last activation on the next link depends on @xmath8 , @xmath63 , @xmath62 and on the link length @xmath64 , given by the nav .",
    "the evolution of the discrete variable @xmath6 depends on decisions made in the last link .",
    "this is summarized as follows : @xmath65 given a known state vector @xmath60 , the next speed value is not exactly known , but it depends on the next link s set of properties @xmath66 given by the nav .",
    "the transition probability @xmath28 dictates the random evolution of the system state vector , i.e. , the random process @xmath67 , where the @xmath68 are @xmath69-measurable for all @xmath70 .",
    "an admissible control sequence depends on the state value at future times , which are unpredictable , and so are the future control domains .",
    "nonetheless , one can define of a sequence of hybrid control laws , or a _ hybrid policy _",
    "@xmath71 where each @xmath72 is a function of the hybrid state into a hybrid control @xmath73 :    a hybrid policy @xmath74 is a sequence of functions @xmath75 where @xmath76 a policy @xmath77 is said to be an _ admissible hybrid policy wrt @xmath78 _ if , given a initial state @xmath78 , the sequence @xmath79 is an admissible hybrid control sequence for all @xmath80 .",

    "firstly , it states in what conditions the pmss are synthesized and shows some of its main characteristics .",
    "secondly , results of the performance of the calculated pmss running in real speed cycles are shown .",
    "the performances of policies @xmath77 are discussed in the light of the economic gain relative to a pure ev strategy , i.e. , a strategy that does not use the re , namely @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the soc when the re is not activated . also , the cpu time needed for policy evaluation is commented .",
    "in this section , three different ways of adding some lag / delay information in the synthesis of optimal controllers are analyzed .",
    "the first one is a rather classical strategy of penalization of the switch cost @xmath87 by a factor @xmath129 .",
    "the second technique profits from the available nav data in order to imbue the dynamic programming algorithm implicitly with time - related information  recall that the dynamic programming algorithm is based on a route segmentation , being thus space - related .",
    "finally , the third method is the one given by algorithms [ backwardevaluation ] and [ trajectoryconstruction ] , using the state variable @xmath130 and not relying on any particular structure of the problem itself , thus having the advantage of being flexible and general .      in order to establish a benchmark",
    "this section analyzes controllers synthesized using nav data and simulated in its ideal case , i.e. a deterministic case where the vehicle speed through the route follows exactly the nav suggested speed - and hence , is perfectly known .",
    "this result will then be compared to the same controller simulated in real driving conditions , using data record from the vehicle in order to assess the performance loss .    as pointed out , the deterministic approach consists in assuming that the driver will follow exactly the speed profile suggested by the nav .",
    "hence , the variable @xmath26 can be removed from the hybrid state and the problem takes a deterministic form . for a fixed route , and",
    "thus a fixed nav suggested speed profile , the value function is evaluated using the backward dynamic programming algorithm [ backwardevaluation ] where the expected value is dropped since it considers but one possible realization of the driver speed .",
    "then , setting initial conditions , the controller is synthesized using algorithm [ trajectoryconstruction ] . throughout all simulations , @xmath131 .      because the intermittent fast switching is undesirable , one possible approach that aims at decreasing the number of switches of the re is the switch cost penalization .",
    "this approach sets @xmath133 and includes a multiplicative penalty @xmath129 at each switch of the re , increasing the switch cost to @xmath134 .",
    "the cpu time is of @xmath135 seconds for all values of @xmath132 . for @xmath136",
    "the system is in its nominal cost configuration without any lag / delay constraints .",
    "indeed , the strategy has a better performance than when we add the penalty ( cf table [ tab : performancecriteriaforalgorithms ] ) , as one should expect . for @xmath137",
    ", a compromise is achieved between the criteria obtained and the number of switches executed .",
    "the controller executes @xmath138 switches but , by inspecting the trajectories , one can remark that they are not sufficiently apart to respect the decision lag constraint . for @xmath139 the strategy does not change .",
    "it becomes optimal to turn on the re right away and turn it off only near the end of the route because of the higher cost to restart it later .",
    "the penalization technique in spite of reducing the number of switches effectively does not respect the control constraints needed in real applications .",
    "indeed , even if there are fewer switches , they are not necessarily spaced enough in time to respect the decision lag .",
    "additionally , in no case the execution delay constraint is respected .",
    "this is an expected behavior as the penalization technique does not supply any direct information about any of the control constraints to the value function . despite the advantages  simple numerical implementation and fast execution time ",
    "this approach does not seem fit for the desired application .",
    ".performance criteria for penalized deterministic controllers with @xmath140 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this work presents a stochastic dynamic programming algorithm for synthesizing optimal power management strategies , suitable for range - extender electric vehicles .",
    "the stochastic model considers that along a geographic route the vehicle s speed is given by a mean value plus a random disturbance .",
    "the hybrid dynamical system framework is used to state an hybrid optimal control problem .",
    "the model considered presents two important features , namely , the utilization of information from the vehicle s navigation system the inclusion of physical constraints on the range - extender  the activation delay and the decision lag .",
    "three methods for including the aforementioned control constraints are studied : penalization of the switching cost , discretization of the path in multiples of the delay / lag time and inclusion of a time state variable . as a conclusion ,",
    "the only method capable of taking into account the delay / lag constraints in a stochastic scenario is the general formulation , including a time state variable .",
