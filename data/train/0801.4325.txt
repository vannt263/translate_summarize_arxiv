    "during the past decade , long - duration ( @xmath7sec ) @xmath8ray bursts ( grbs ) , including the subclass of x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) , have been found ( 1 ) to be driven by the core - collapse of massive stars @xcite ; thus ( 2 ) to be associated with a rare variety ( @xmath9 ) of type ibc supernovae ( sne ) , the so - called hypernovae ( hn ) @xcite ( but also see fynbo et al .",
    "2006 ) ; and ( 3 ) in general to be hosted by the star - forming dwarf galaxies with low metallicity @xcite .",
    "though the association of grb / xrf and ibc sn has been pinned down , what channels make a dying star to produce a grb or an xrf , and not just a ibc sn , is still unclear .",
    "the progenitor s mass , metallicity , angular momentum , and the configuration and strength of its internal magnetic field play important roles for the generation of grbs / xrfs and ordinary ibc sne .",
    "the serendipitous discovery of the x - ray transient 080109/sn2008d may shed light on filling in this gap between energetic grbs / xrfs and ordinary ibc sne .",
    "we will analyze space- and ground - based data of this transient and sn , focusing on x - ray / radio data because observationally they trace the fastest component of the transient / sn outflow while optical data trace the slower sn ejecta ( e.g. , soderberg et al .",
    "during _ swift_/xrt follow - up observations of ib sn 2007uy beginning at 13:32:49 ut on jan 9 , 2008 , an x - ray transient ( transient hereafter ) was identified and reported on jan 10.58 @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission was already underway at time of trigger .",
    "both transient 080109 and sn 2007uy are in the same host galaxy , ngc2770 , at @xmath10 .",
    "the object was within the _ swift_/bat field of view for approximately 30 minutes prior to the xrt observation but never triggered bat @xcite .    since trigger",
    ", the transient was observed to rise to a maximum flux about 65 seconds , and then subsequently decay until the end of the first orbit , roughly 500 seconds afterwards .",
    "we reduced the xrt data in a standard way using the swift analysis software ( heasoft 6.4 ) and calibration data .",
    "the contamination by a source close to the transient and pile - up have been corrected .",
    "a general spectral softening was seen during the first orbit . taking a mean spectrum ,",
    "the data can be well fitted by either an absorbed power - law @xmath11 and a column density @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) with respect to the galactic number @xmath14 or by an absorbed blackbody spectrum with @xmath15 in the restframe ( @xmath16 ) . for the late x - ray data",
    ", the spectral index can not be well fitted due to the limited photon numbers but @xmath17 is acceptable .",
    "uvot marginally detected an optical counterpart to the x - ray transient on jan 9 in the b ( 3.4@xmath18 ) and u ( 3.0@xmath18 ) filters . after a data gap of 2 days , the source brightened and showed up in both optical and uv .",
    "the source then faded until day @xmath19 and subsequently brightened again , confirming the onset of sn2008d ( page et al .",
    "2008 ) .    ,",
    "two spectra were obtained at the eso vlt equipped with fors2 starting 07:17 ut on jan 11 . as pointed in malesani et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the overall spectral shape rules out a significant non - thermal afterglow component , but a sn one instead .",
    "the presence of broad features reveal sn2008d s emergence , but the features are not as broad as in the earliest spectra of grb / xrf - associated sne such as sn1998bw and sn2006aj .",
    "sn2008d is distinguished for its apparent ic@xmath20ib spectroscopic evolution .",
    "it was classified as peculiar type - ic on jan 11 , and then as a type - ic with possibly some he as seen in nir spectra on jan 13 - 15 , and later to a type - ib on jan 21 ( modjaz et al .",
    "2008 and reference therein ) .",
    "this evolution is reminiscent of sn2005bf ( folatelli et al .",
    "though it s impossible to know the exact onset time of the transient , we may get a rough estimate about this time - back shift .",
    "first , non - trigger of bat approximately 30 minutes prior to the xrt trigger and association with sn2008d give us confidence that transient 080109 is a dwarf outburst compared with previous bursts featuring low @xmath21 peak energy such as xrf060218 .",
    "second , the existence of a main outburst 30 minutes earlier would make the first orbit lightcurve look like a very sharp flare with a decay index @xmath22 covering thee order of magnitudes in luminosity .",
    "its profile is not similar to the fast - rise - exponential - decay one typical for grb / xrf .",
    "considering the above two factors , a back shift of tens to @xmath23 sec is generally acceptable and does nt affect the temporal decay laws after 1000 sec . in this work ,",
    "we adopt a back shift of @xmath24100 sec",
    ".    should a shock break - out be responsible for the first orbit observation , according to the equation @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the isotropic luminosity , @xmath27 is the solid angle for the outburst , @xmath28 is the lorentz factor for the outburst with respect to the observer , @xmath18 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath29 is the temperature in the restframe , we then have @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the measured temperature . to match the measured @xmath32 kev , a jet - like outflow with @xmath33",
    "is needed , which renders the shock break - out model unacceptable in this event .",
    "the transient lightcurve is smooth and decays as @xmath34 .",
    "the smoothness largely disfavors that these x - ray photons are powered by internal shocks , and the steep decline rules out that the transient is from the forward shock of an outflow .",
    "we consider a mild - relativistic ( @xmath35 3 ) outflow with a luminosity @xmath36 decelerated by the stellar wind medium , where @xmath37 is the solid angle of the initial transient outflow .",
    "the density profile of the stellar wind is @xmath38 , where the free wind parameter @xmath39[v_w/(10 ^ 8~{\\rm cm}~{\\rm s^{-1}})]$ ] , @xmath40 is the mass loss rate of the progenitor , and @xmath41 is the velocity of the stellar wind @xcite . because of the low luminosity of the outflow while the high density of the stellar wind , the forward - shocked material would move sub - relativistically ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) while the reverse shock is mild - relativistic .",
    "the reverse shock region is thus very hot and has a very large sideways expansion velocity of @xmath43 , the speed of light . as a result ,",
    "after the reverse shock crosses the outflow , the shocked outflow will have a large solid angle @xmath44 if @xmath37 is small .",
    "so for simplicity we treat the outflow as isotropic .",
    "now we estimate the synchrotron radiation of the reverse shock at a distance @xmath45 cm . as usual , we assume @xmath46 and @xmath47 fractions of the shock energy given to the electrons and magnetic field , respectively @xcite",

    "the cooling lorentz factor is @xmath52 , so the reverse shock is in the fast cooling phase . at a first glimpse",
    ", one might interpret the @xmath53 decline as the high latitude emission of the reverse shock .",
    "but this requires either a sub - relativistic outflow with a very sharp energy distribution from the outflow center to the outflow side or a @xmath54 a few .",
    "the validity of the former option is hard to estimate .",
    "the latter is also difficult to function because @xmath55 .",
    "a @xmath56 requires @xmath57 , which is too high to match the observation .    in this work",
    "we interpret the steep x - ray decline as the dimmer and dimmer reverse shock emission powered by the weaker and weaker outflow . within this scenario ,",
    "the outflow is very likely to be mildly relativistic .",
    "if @xmath58 tens@xmath59hundreds , @xmath60 and @xmath61 would be @xmath62 kev . as a result ,",
    "the xrt spectrum should be @xmath63 , which is inconsistent with the observed value .",
    "a marginally relativistic ( @xmath64 ) outflow model is also disfavored because the reverse shock would be very weak . with typical shock parameters ,",
    "the emission of such a weak reverse shock can not peak at soft x - ray band and is likely to be outshone by the forward shock x - ray emission .",
    "we calculate the synchrotron radiation of the sub - relativistic forward shock when it sweeps up the surrounding stellar wind medium .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor of the shocked electrons , the magnetic field and the cooling lorentz factor are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , respectively , where @xmath69 .",
    "the maximum specific flux , the typical synchrotron radiation frequency and the cooling frequency @xcite are respectively given by @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the luminosity distance of the source .",
    "so the x - ray flux can be estimated as @xmath74 if @xmath75const .",
    ", i.e. , the outflow hasnt been decelerated significantly , we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the decline is thus too shallow to be consistent with the detected @xmath78 for the early x - ray afterglow .",
    "we then consider an alternative in which the outflow with a energy distribution @xmath79 has entered the sedov regime , thus we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "accordingly , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f_numax]-[eq : nu_c ] ) read @xmath82,@xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively .",

    "t^{-{1\\over 3+k}[1+{(p-1)(7+k ) \\over 2}]+{1\\over 2 } } & { \\rm for~~ \\nu>\\max\\{\\nu_c,\\nu_m\\}}.\\\\ \\end{array}% \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : lc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the early x - ray afterglow decline @xmath86 suggests a very small @xmath87 for @xmath49 , implying that the outflow almost has a very flat energy distribution ( i.e. , the transient ejecta is likely expanding with a single bulk lorentz factor ) .",
    "so we assume @xmath88 , which yields @xmath89 eq.([eq : f_x ] ) thus reduces to @xmath90 which is consistent with the xrt flux @xmath91 at @xmath92 hz at @xmath93 sec ( see fig.1 ) . the outflow energy inferred above is @xmath94 erg , which is larger than the isotropic energy of the x - ray transient by a factor of 10 and is reasonable .",
    "till here we have shown that a mild - relativistic outflow with an energy @xmath95 erg can account for the transient and the early x - ray afterglow self - consistently , which implies that there was no energetic outburst before the x - ray transient .",
    "should it happen , there would be a bright x - ray afterglow component , which actually could outshine the current data .",
    "on the other hand , an earlier outburst would sweep up the stellar wind medium and leave a very low density bubble .",
    "the transient outflow thus can not get decelerated effectively and can not account for the following x - ray afterglow data .",
    "after @xmath96 sec , the x - ray lightcurve gets flattening .",
    "we interpret this flattening as the shock emission of the fastest component of the sn ejecta , which moves with a velocity @xmath97 c ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta_limit ] ) for the limit ) .    as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_x ] ) , if the sn fastest component is energetic enough that hasnt got decelerated significantly in a timescale @xmath98 sec or even longer , we have @xmath99 which is consistent with the observed flattening ( see fig.1 ) .",

    "a reasonable choice of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 leads to that the total energy of the sn fastest component is no less than @xmath107    for comparison , we plot in figure 2 the identified energy distribution of the outflows associated with xrtr 080109/sn 2008d , together with those of ordinary ic sne and the hypernovae associated with energetic grbs / xrfs . at first glimpse ,",
    "the main difference between the ordinary ic sne and the grb / xrf - associated ones is the energy of the ( mild-)relativistic outflow .",

    "the radio afterglow thus will peak when the observation frequency , @xmath113 , crosses @xmath108 at @xmath114 for typical parameters @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , _ we expect the sn radio afterglow will peak at @xmath119 days_.    using eq .",
