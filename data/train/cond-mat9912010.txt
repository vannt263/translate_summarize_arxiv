    "last decade frustrated heisenberg models have been a subject of intensive studies@xmath0 . of main interests",

    "in particular , these properties may be important in the theory of high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "there is much interest in quantum spin systems with competing interactions for which exact ground state can be constructed .",
    "the first example of such a model has been given by majumdar and ghosh@xmath2 .",
    "they have considered @xmath3 chain with antiferromagnetic nearest- and next - nearest neighbor interactions and the strength of the second interaction is one half of the first .",
    "the ground state of this model is two - fold degenerate , consists of dimerized singlets and there is a gap in the spectrum of excited states .",
    "another example found by affleck , kennedy , lieb and tasaki@xmath4 is an @xmath5 spin chain with special bilinear and biquadratic interactions ( aklt model ) .",
    "this model has unique resonating - valence - bond ground state and ground state correlations have exponential decay . besides , there is the gap between ground state and excited states .",
    "further generalizations of the aklt model have been studied in a number recent papers@xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we present two classes of @xmath7 chains for which exact ground state wave function has a special recurrent form .",
    "these models have competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions and their ground states can be either ferromagnetic or singlet depending on the relation between exchange integrals .",
    "the first type of exactly solvable models is related to the systems at the ferromagnet - antiferromagnet transition point when the ferromagnetic and the singlet states are degenerate .",
    "the calculation of the spin correlation function in the singlet ground state shows the spiral magnetic order at this point .",
    "the model of the second type has the nearest , next - nearest and next - next - nearest neighbor interactions depending on one parameter .",

    "this model has all properties of the ",
    "haldane scenario@xmath8 , though it is the model with half - integer spin .",
    "we note , however , that the considered model has two sites in an unit cell and it is equivalent to the special case of a spin ladder . in some limit this model reduces to the effective spin-1 chain for which the ground state wave function coincides with that for the aklt model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will consider the model of the first type and describe the exact singlet ground state wave function as well as details of the spin correlation function calculations .",

    "let us consider @xmath7 spin model with nearest- and next - nearest neighbor interactions given by the hamiltonian @xmath9 with periodic boundary conditions and even @xmath10 .    if @xmath11 , then the ground state of ( 1 ) is ferromagnetic ( singlet ) at @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 ( fig.1 ) .",

    "we expect that these states are degenerate in the thermodynamic limit ( at @xmath252 they are degenerate for finite @xmath43 ) .",
    "the gap in the open chain equals to the difference between the energies of the degenerate ground state and the lowest excited one .",
    "the extrapolation of the results of finite - chain calculations to @xmath159 gives the finite gap in the open chains at @xmath248 .",
    "its value is very close to that for the cyclic chains .",
    "we have studied a class of the one dimensional quantum spin-@xmath205 models with competing interactions .",
    "the exact ground state wave function of these models is found in the special recurrent form .",
    "the hamiltonians of these models are the sums of local , non - commuting with each other hamiltonians ; the ground state wave function of the total hamiltonian is the ground state solution for each of them .",
    "this means that this ground state wave function is superstable@xmath65 with respect to each local hamiltonian .",
    "one of the studied models describes the transition point from the ferromagnetic to the spiral state when the energies of these two states are equal to each other .",
    "it is interesting to compare the exact quantum singlet state with the classical one .",
    "both states are the states of a helical type ( excluding some special cases ) and their spin correlation functions are identical in the thermodynamic limit though quantum effects are essential for finite chains .",
    "this fact is rather surprising for the one - dimensional model with spin @xmath205 .",
    "another exactly solvable hamiltonian has the antiferromagnetic ground state .",
    "this state is non - degenerate for the closed chains and is four - fold degenerate for the open ones .",
    "the hamiltonian depends on the one parameter @xmath325 and there are two special values , @xmath319 and @xmath306 where the singlet and the ferromagnetic states are degenerate .",
    "the value @xmath319 is the ferromagnet - antiferromagnet transition point where the phase transition of the first order with respect to @xmath251 occurs .",
    "the ground state is characterized by the exponential decay of correlators with a very short correlation length , and there is the gap in the excitation spectrum at @xmath248 .",
    "thus , this model has all properties suggested by haldane@xmath8 for the one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet with integer spin .",
    "the first model for which all these properties have been proved rigorously is the aklt model .",
    "our model is the one with spin @xmath326 .",
    "affleck and lieb@xmath327 have shown for the translationally invariant and the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonians that for half - integer spin chain either the excitation spectrum is gapless or the ground state is degenerate .",
    "the existence of the finite gap in our model does not contradict to affleck - lieb theorem because this model is not translationally invariant .",
    "it has two sites in the unit cell and is equivalent to the special ladder model .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath254 its ground state wave function reduces to that for the aklt model .",
    "we are grateful to profs.m.ya.ovchinnikova and v.n.prigodin for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by istc under grant no.015 - 94 and in part by rffr no.33727 .",
    "we prove that square of the total raising operator annihilates @xmath40 if the condition ( 51 ) is satisfied .",
    "the recurrent equation for @xmath328 is @xmath329      the first term in eq.(a1 ) vanishes under the condition ( 51 ) and , therefore , @xmath330 \\\\ & & \\times \\left [ ( 1 + 2\\nu _ 2)s_3^{+}+(\\nu _ 1 + 2\\nu _ 2)s_4^{+}+\\nu _ 2s^{+}(n-4)\\right]\\ldots   \\times ( s_{n-1}^{+}+s_n^{+})^2\\left [ s_{n-1}^{+}+\\nu _ 1s_n^{+}\\right ]          let us consider functions @xmath334 , @xmath335 and @xmath336 .",
    "the recurrent equations for these functions are obtained from ( a2 ) using ( a1 ) .",
    "they are @xmath337 @xmath338 @xmath339 |1,2\\rangle \\nonumber,\\ ] ] where @xmath340            this form of @xmath331 is similar to the matrix product wave function of the aklt model and its generalizations which has been found in ref.15 .",
    "each of four matrix elements of @xmath342 is the eigenfunction of the local hamiltonian @xmath209 for @xmath350 because of matrix elements of the product @xmath351 are the eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian .",
    "besides , it can be proved@xmath6 that the four matrix elements of @xmath342 are the only ground states of ( 45 ) and , therefore , the ground state of the open chain is four - fold degenerate .",
    "it is easily to check@xmath6 that the triplet wave functions @xmath352 and @xmath353 are not eigenfunctions of @xmath241 . on the other hand , using cyclic permutations of matrices under the @xmath354 , we have @xmath355 and , therefore , the ground state of the cyclic chain is the non - degenerate singlet ."
