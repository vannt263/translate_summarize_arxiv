    "how effectively may we estimate the strength of a simple interaction such as the transmittivity of a beam splitter or the phase - shift imposed in the internal arms of an interferometer ?",

    "if the initial preparation of two modes is described by the density matrix @xmath10 the evolved state in the interaction picture is given by @xmath11 in this paper we devote our attention to the estimation of @xmath6 through measurements performed on @xmath12 .",

    "our objective is to find the best strategy , _",
    "i.e. _ the povm that provides the optimal estimation of the parameter @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath6 is manifestly a phase - shift , we can use general results from phase estimation theory , which provides the optimal povm to estimate the phase - shift induced by a _ phase generator _ , _",
    "i.e. _ a selfadjoint operator with discrete , equally spaced , spectrum .",
    "the optimality criterion is given in terms of the minimization of the mean value of a cost function @xcite that assesses the quality of the strategy , _",
    "i.e. _ it weights the errors in the estimates .",
    "since a phase - shift is a @xmath17-periodic parameter , the cost function must be a @xmath17-periodic even function of @xmath18 , _",
    "i.e. _ it has fourier expansion with cosines only .",
    "the appropriate concavity properties of the cost function are reflected by expansion coefficients which are all negative apart the irrelevant additive constant . a cost",
    "function with such fourier expansion has been firstly considered by holevo @xcite , and for such reason it is usually referred to as belonging to holevo s class .",
    "notice that the optimal povm for a given state @xmath10 is the same for every cost function in this class .",
    "a more general quantum estimation approach for different kinds of phase - shift and general quantum system is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", it is also shown that the kind of problem we are presently dealing with is , in a certain sense , the best situation , since the spectrum of our phase generator is the whole set of integers @xmath19 , including negative ones . in this case",
    ", there is an optimal orthogonal projective povm , which can be regarded as the spectral resolution of a self - adjoint phase operator .",
    "however , if the estimation is performed with the constraint of bounded or fixed energy , the optimal povm and the optimal input state @xmath10 do not correspond to a canonical quantum observable scheme @xcite . moreover , in general the optimal povm depends on the input state , and the optimal povm of ref .",
    "@xcite holds only for pure states , whereas a generalization to a class of mixed states , the so - called _ phase - pure _ states , has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the optimal povm , in the sense described above , provides an unbiased estimation of @xmath6 for preparation @xmath10 of the two modes , in formula @xmath20 \\qquad\\forall \\rho_\\psi = u_\\psi \\rho_0 u^\\dag_\\psi \\:.\\ ] ] on the other hand , we want also to find the optimal state @xmath10 for the estimation of @xmath6 according to some cost function , which quantifies the noise of the estimation .",
    "the customary root mean square is not a good choice for a cost function , since the function @xmath21 is not @xmath17-periodic . a good definition for the precision of the measurement is given by the average of the cost function @xmath22 , _ i. e. _ a `` periodicized variance '' , which obviously belongs to the holevo s class .",
    "if the estimates occur within a small interval around the true value of the parameter @xmath6 , one has approximately @xmath23 , whence @xmath24 can be assumed as a reasonable measure of the precision of the measurement .",
    "in order to solve our estimation problem , let us consider the following unitary transformation @xmath25 using eq .",

    "it is useful , in order to calculate the solution of this equation , to write the generic state @xmath51 in the following way @xmath64 the coefficients @xmath65 determine the normalized projection of @xmath66 into the eigenspace @xmath43 , whereas the @xmath67 s are the coefficients which combine those projections .    using eq .",

    "in conclusion , we dealt with the problem of estimating the coupling constant of a bilinear interaction . in our approach",
    "the coupling constant , which appears in the exponent of the time evolution operator , has been treated as a phase parameter .",
    "the optimal povm has been derived according to the theory of quantum phase estimation @xcite . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite this resorts to an su(2 ) estimation problem with the schwinger two - mode boson realization . however , the representation is not irreducible , and a more complicated problem is faced . in this sense",
    "our results generalize those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the estimation of @xmath2 phase - shifts has been analyzed in irreducible subspaces : indeed we found an improved scaling of phase variance versus the total energy .",
    "the degeneracy of the spectrum of the the hamiltonian , can be treated using the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite , and , in this way , the problem is reduced to a nondegenerate one with spectrum @xmath104 for the phase - shift operator .",
    "it is important to remark that the optimal povm depends on the preparation state .",
    "this is true for every kind of phase estimation problem , but in the presence of degeneracy the dependence is crucial .",
    "in fact , one has to define the optimal povm as a block diagonal operator , where the invariant subspaces are spanned by projections of the input state into the eigenspaces of the generator .",
    "from a practical point of view this means that optimal estimation of the phase - shift imposed to a state , needs a measuring device which is adapted to the shifted state .",
    "we then optimized the input state by minimizing the average cost for fixed input energy and found a power law @xmath105 in a range @xmath106 .",
    "notice that the law @xmath107 is the same as in the optimal phase estimation with only one mode @xcite , however with a much smaller constant @xmath108 ( @xmath102 instead of @xmath109 ) .",
    "we think that this phenomenon of improvement of phase sensitivity by increasing the number of modes is the same considered in ref .",
