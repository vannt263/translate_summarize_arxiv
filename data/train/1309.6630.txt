    "moreover every plcker coordinate occurs as an element of @xmath7 for some postnikov diagram @xmath6 and thus every plcker coordinate is either a cluster variable or a coefficient . when @xmath9 every seed is of this form and consequently every cluster variable is a plcker coordinate . in general",
    "the homogeneous coordinate ring is of wild type  possessing infinitely many seeds and infinitely many cluster variables , which in general will not be plcker coordinates and which are , at present , unclassified .    in this paper",

    "we express these laurent expansions in terms of _ dimer configurations _",
    "( also known as perfect matchings ) for a weighted bipartite graph @xmath13 subject to boundary conditions determined by the plcker coordinate .",
    "the graph @xmath14 is dual ( in an appropriate sense ) to the postnikov diagram , and its edges are weighted by monomials taken from the extended cluster @xmath7 ; see definition  [ d : weights ] in section  [ s : clusterstructure ] .",
    "recall that a bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices are partitioned into two types , or colours ( black and white ) , where edges join vertices of a different colour .",
    "such a graph is said to be _ balanced _ if there is an equal number of black and white vertices .",

    "@xmath29 is the ( non - extended ) cluster corresponding to @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , as an element of the rational function field of the grassmannian , the ratio on the left hand side of this formula does not depend on @xmath6 ; this is a key step in the proof .",
    "this rational expression is in fact the laurent expansion of the twisted plcker coordinate @xmath28}}}$ ] for the seed @xmath5 , since the edge - weights which contribute to the dimer partition function in the numerator are monomials in the extended cluster @xmath7 .",
    "dimer configurations have also been used as a method for computing laurent expansions for cluster variables for cluster algebras of finite classical type  @xcite , and for cluster algebras associated to triangulations of surfaces  @xcite .",

    "note that in general , the case considered here , i.e.  @xmath11 $ ] , is not of finite mutation type .",
    "our interest in the twist map partly stems from its close relationship with the bfz - twist automorphism  @xcite defined on a unipotent cell @xmath31 in the group @xmath32 of all complex @xmath33 unipotent matrices , where @xmath34 is the grassmann permutation .",
    "this cell is birationally equivalent to @xmath0 , so the bfz - twist can be transported to @xmath0 .",

    "the cluster algebra structures on @xmath31 and @xmath0 are identified , up to coefficients , through the birational equivalence . in particular , every seed associated to a reduced expression for @xmath34 corresponds to a seed attached to a postnikov diagram .",

    "the approach taken by  @xcite is different from the approach here : specifically , the formulas in  @xcite involve an analysis of families of noncrossing paths in planar diagrams , while our formulas use dimer configurations .",
    "an interesting question is how to reconcile these two approaches .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the formulas obtained in this paper with the formulas in  @xcite , also given in terms of families of paths .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : twist ] , we introduce the twist map on the grassmannian , which we define in terms of generalized cross products of the columns of the @xmath35 matrix representing a point in the grassmannian .    in section  [ s : twistpluecker ] ,",
    "we show ( in proposition  [ p : twistcomputation ] ) that the twist of a plcker coordinate @xmath36}$ ] given by a @xmath2-subset @xmath22 which is a disjoint union of two cyclic intervals is , up to coefficients , a plcker coordinate of the same kind , using turnbull s identity ( as expressed in the article  @xcite ) .",
    "we suspect that these are the only plcker coordinates with this property .",
    "for example , it can be verified by hand , in the case of the grassmannian @xmath37 , that a twisted plcker coordinate @xmath28}}}$ ] , where @xmath22 is not a disjoint union of two cyclic intervals , is a cluster variable which is not a plcker coordinate ( even up to coefficients ) .    in section",
    "[ s : periodicity ] , we compute the double twist of a plcker coordinate and use this to show that the twist map is periodic , up to coefficients ( corollary  [ c : periodic ] ) .",
    "we then explain the relationship to the bfz - twist in proposition  [ p : relationship ] in section  [ s : bfztwist ] .    in section  [ s :",
    "clusterstructure ] , we recall the cluster structure of the grassmannian as described in  @xcite in terms of postnikov diagrams  @xcite .",
    "we review the definition of the bipartite graph dual to a postnikov diagram and the blow - up and blow - down equivalences inherited from the oriented lens creation and annihilation moves for postnikov diagrams .",
    "we introduce a scheme for weighting the edges of such a bipartite graph , with the property that the induced weighting on dimer configurations is invariant under blow - ups and blow - downs .    in section  [",
    "s : invariance ] we fix a postnikov diagram , @xmath6 , and a @xmath2-subset @xmath22 .",
    "we show , in proposition  [ prop : flipmoveinvariance ] , that the dimer partition function of @xmath24 , divided by the product of the elements in @xmath38 , is invariant under quadrilateral moves .",
    "since any postnikov diagram can be reached from any other by a sequence of such moves , it follows that this scaled dimer partition function is independent of the choice of postnikov diagram .    in section  [ s : regular ] , we show that the main result is true for the plcker coordinates in @xmath39 for a regular postnikov diagram @xmath40 whose dual bipartite graph , @xmath41 , is , up to some boundary edges , part of a hexagonal tiling of the plane .",
    "the diagram obtained from @xmath42 by reversing its strands ( and adding crossings at the boundary ) is again a postnikov diagram , which we denote by @xmath43 .",

    "this @xmath2-subset , @xmath22 , is a disjoint union of two cyclic intervals in @xmath23 , which allows us to use to compare the dimer partition function @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , with the formula for @xmath28}}}$ ] given by proposition  [ p : twistcomputation ] in section  [ s : twist ] .",
    "the main result , theorem  [ t : mainresult ] , is shown in section  [ s : mainresult ] , using the fact that twists of plcker coordinates and the scaled dimer partition functions both satisfy the short plcker relations .",
    "in section  [ s : example ] , we give an example , and in section  [ s : surfaces ] we discuss generalization to the surface case .",
