    "it was demonstrated that the contribution of the vector field to the primordial curvature perturbation can generate a new observable signature : statistical anisotropy .",
    "moreover , it can affect large scale dynamics by supporting anisotropic inflation.@xcite finally , if @xmath6 is an inflaton , this type of kinetic term can help to overcome the @xmath1-problem of inflation.@xcite    generally vector field contribution to the curvature perturbation introduces quadrupolar angular dependence of the power spectrum . in ref .",
    "( see also  ) it was shown that observational constraints on such modulation put very stringent bounds on vector field models .",
    "this bound , however , was applied for a particular model of ref .  .",
    "as it is shown in later sections , a much larger parameter space might be available for model building .    in this work",
    "i perform a classical dynamical analysis of the system with a scalar and a vector field which interacts via a @xmath2 coupling .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed in ref .   and much more generally in ref .  .",
    "it has been also applied in many other contexts , for example a system of non - abelian vector fields@xcite , a vector field plus a two - form field@xcite or dbi type action@xcite .",
    "building on the former two works , especially ref .  , i extend their treatment by including more general initial conditions and by addressing several issues which have been overlooked in previous works .",
    "i also provide exact analytic expressions to determine the asymptotic behaviour of this dynamical system .",
    "a vector field introduces anisotropic stress .",
    "if it contributes to the expansion of the universe , the expansion will be anisotropic .",
    "as the ( homogeneous , space - like ) vector field picks out only one preferred direction in space , we can assume that the anisotropy of the expansion will be of the axisymmetric bianchi type i. moreover , the preferred axis of such anisotropy will be aligned with the direction of the vector field .",
    "these two constraints were imposed in previous works on a single vector field . even if such a configuration is self",
    "consistent , initial conditions can be much more general . in this work",
    "i relax both the constraints and confirm that the axial symmetry as well as the alignment are achieved dynamically if the vector field does not decay .    in cases",
    "where the vector field is absent a number of no - hair theorems have been proven , which state that the future attractor of any spatially homogeneous but anisotropic universe ( with possible exception of bianchi ix ) is the isotropic frw universe if the energy density is dominated by the potential energy of a scalar field.@xcite , , where @xmath7 . ] see ref .",

    "for the most recent work on no - hair theorems .",
    "the presence of a vector field introduces anisotropic stress into the energy - momentum tensor . for some parameter values ,",
    "as we will see later in this letter , the anisotropic stress does not redshift away with the expansion of the universe , therefore violating some of the assumptions underlying no - hair theorems .",
    "in particular , due to the non - vanishing homogeneous vector field , the isotropic frw universe is no longer an attractor but rather an axisymmetric bianchi i universe is the attractor .",
    "this is indeed demonstrated to be the case starting from bianchi type ii and iii as well as kantowski - sachs metrics in ref .  . however , these authors assumed from the onset an alignment of the vector field with one of the preferred directions of the metric . more generally , the authors of ref",
    ".   derived an expression which relates the spatial anisotropy to a general form of anisotropic stress , assuming an inflating universe . in this letter ,",
    "i show by a concrete example how a generic bianchi i space - time dynamically aligns itself with a direction of the vector field and two perpendicular axes of the bianchi i metric isotropise . for constant model parameters this attractor",
    "is reached from the most general initial conditions .",
    "even if one does restrict initial conditions to the axial symmetry and the orientation of that axis along the homogeneous vector field , effectively excluding some dynamical degrees of freedom , it still needs to be recognised that to ascertain the stability of a particular configuration , the stability of those degrees of freedom must be demonstrated .",
    "this is particularly relevant when dealing with inflation models where any fixed point is constantly being perturbed by quantum stochastic noise terms .",
    "moreover , those degrees of freedom are more important in the present setup because anisotropic expansion couples modes of different spin .",
    "this is in contrast to frw metric , where scalar , vector and tensor modes evolve independently . to account for this enlarged dynamical phase space six equations",
    "are added to the ones considered in previous works on anisotropic inflation with @xmath0 term .",
    "consider a classical dynamical system described by the following action @xmath8,\\label{action}\\ ] ] where the first term is the einstein - hilbert term , @xmath6 is the scalar field with a potential @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the vector field strength tensor , and the kinetic function @xmath11 is modulated by the scalar field .",
    "the presence of the vector field provides anisotropic stress , which likely makes the spacetime metric anisotropic .",
