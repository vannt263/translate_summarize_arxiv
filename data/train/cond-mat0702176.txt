    "<S> the evolution of electron conductance in the presence of inelastic effects is studied as an atomic gold contact is formed evolving from a low - conductance regime ( tunneling ) to a high - conductance regime ( contact ) . in order to characterize each regime , </S>",

    "<S> the conductance is calculated by first evaluating the transmission of electrons through the system , and secondly by calculating the conductance change due to the excitation of vibrations . as found in previous studies [ paulsson _ et al . </S>",

    "<S> b. * 72 * , 201101(r ) ( 2005 ) ] the change in conductance due to inelastic effects permits to characterize the crossover from tunneling to contact . the most notorious effect being the crossover from an increase in conductance in the tunneling regime to a decrease in conductance in the contact regime when the bias voltage matches a vibrational threshold . </S>",
    "<S> our dft - based calculations actually show that the effect of vibrational modes in electron conductance is rather complex , in particular when modes localized in the contact region are permitted to extend into the electrodes . as an example , we find that certain modes can give rise to decreases in conductance when in the tunneling regime , opposite to the above mentioned result . whereas details in the inelastic spectrum depend on the size of the vibrational region </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the overall change in conductance is quantitatively well approximated by the simplest calculation where only the apex atoms are allowed to vibrate . </S>",
    "<S> our study is completed by the application of a simplified model where the relevant parameters are obtained from the above dft - based calculations . </S>"
