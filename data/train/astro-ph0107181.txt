    "in relatively nearby starburst galaxies , recent star formation activity has typically been resolved into massive star clusters . while old globular clusters are ubiquitous at the current epoch , only over the past decade have we begun to find their younger and bluer siblings ,  super star clusters \" ( sscs ) , in significant numbers @xcite .",
    "the large number of globular clusters in the local universe appear to have been formed during the early stages of galaxy evolution .",
    "therefore , studying the genesis of local sscs can yield information about the environment in which globular clusters formed in the early universe .",
    "the conditions required for massive star cluster formation are far from understood , but it seems clear that extreme environments , uncommon in the local universe , are necessary .",
    "current theories suggest that high pressures , such as those due to large - scale shocks in merging galaxies @xcite , are required in order to form bound massive star clusters .",
    "in fact , there is a large body of evidence that globular clusters are formed in galactic interactions and mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , a handful of very young massive star clusters still embedded in their birth material have been discovered in the galaxies ngc  5253 @xcite , he  2 - 10 @xcite , ngc  2146 @xcite , and ngc  4214 @xcite .",
    "embedded in these heavily enshrouded clusters are hundreds of young massive stars that create surrounding h regions and manifest themselves as optically thick free - free radio sources .",
    "similar dense , inverted - spectrum h regions exist around individual stars in our galaxy ( i.e. , ultracompact h regions , uchs , wood & churchwell 1989 ) , albeit on a vastly smaller scale . because of their apparent spectral similarity to galactic uchs , @xcite dubbed these extragalactic objects `` ultradense h regions '' ( udhs ) .",
    "the physical properties of these clusters are truly remarkable ; the estimated sizes ( a few parsecs ) , stellar masses ( a few @xmath12 @xmath13 ) , ionizing luminosities ( @xmath14 erg ) , and ages ( possibly as young as a few @xmath15 years ) of the newly discovered udhs imply that we may be witnessing the birth process of super star clusters .",
    "the discovery of these udhs allows us to begin observing the earliest stages of the massive star cluster formation for the first time .    because udhs have only recently been identified in the literature ,",
    "one of our primary goals is simply to expand the sample of known objects in order to understand their properties in a statistical sense . to this end , we have searched for previously published radio observations that may have also serendipitously detected udhs .",
    "multiwavelength radio observations taken to study supernovae remnants in nearby galaxies are particularly useful for this purpose . in most cases ,",
    "the original authors have identified the candidate udhs we present here as `` thermal sources '' or `` h regions . ''",
    "we seek sources with positive radio spectral indices ( @xmath0 , where @xmath16 ) , implying an optically thick free - free origin . in this article , we utilize previously published radio observations of m33 , ngc  253 , and ngc  6946 to identify new candidate udhs , determine their number of ionizing stars , and estimate their physical sizes , densities , and masses .",
    "here we overview basic properties of the galaxies in our sample and only highlight the radio observations utilized in this paper .",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers for more detail on the observations and reduction . because the observations were compiled from a variety of sources , the observations are heterogeneous in nature , and in some cases , non - ideal for our purposes . for example , in order to obtain accurate relative fluxes at multiple frequencies it is desirable to have well matched beam sizes ; we will discuss the impact of mismatched beams in section  [ detection ] .",
    "however , these data provide a valuable resource for this fledgling field and will serve as a useful baseline for follow - up observations .",
    "m33 ( ngc  598 ) is a local group spiral galaxy ( sc(s)ii - iii ) , nearly face - on ( @xmath17 , * ? ? ? * ) , and it is rich in h regions @xcite .",
    "young ( @xmath18 yr ) clusters in m33 were recently studied by @xcite , and were found to have masses of @xmath19 , smaller than that typical for its old globular clusters .",
    "m33 has a star formation rate of log(sfr )  @xmath20  m@xmath21  yr@xmath22  kpc@xmath23 @xcite , making it the least prolific galaxy in this sample . at a distance of 840 kpc @xcite , it is also the closest of the galaxies in this paper .",

    "the primary beams at 20  cm were @xmath24 with the vla and @xmath25 with wsrt . at 6  cm both telescopes had primary beams of @xmath26 .",
    "the 6  cm observations had resolutions ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , and the 20  cm observations had resolutions ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath29 , depending on the uv taper used in the cleaning process . matched beam observations were convolved to identical beams of @xmath30 fwhm .",

    "four young sscs were discovered optically in the central region of ngc  253 by @xcite ; however , only one of these clusters is apparent in the mid - ir observations of @xcite , who propose that it might be exceptionally young . @xcite",

    "ngc  253 was observed by @xcite with the b configuration of the vla at 1.3 , 2 , 3.6 , 6 , and 20  cm ( 23.56 , 14.94 , 8.44 , 4.86 , and 1.49  ghz ) between 1987 and 1995 .",
    "additional observations at 1.3 and 2  cm were made using the a configuration .",
    "as the beam sizes at 6 and 20 cm are significantly larger than at 1.3 , 2 , and 3.6 cm , we have not included this longer wavelength data in our analysis because of the unwanted background contribution from non - thermal emission .",

    "@xcite have detected 107 young massive star clusters , one of which has received particular attention because of its age ( @xmath50 myr ) and mass ( @xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "sub - mm images obtained by @xcite show 850 @xmath46 m emission which , in some cases , may be associated with radio sources discussed in this paper .    the vla was used to survey ngc  6946 with the b and a arrays at 6 and 20  cm ( 4.86 and 1.45  ghz ) , respectively , by @xcite .",
    "approximately 8.6  hours were spent in at each frequency .",
    "the primary beams were @xmath26 and @xmath24 at 6  cm and 20  cm , respectively .",
    "the resulting beam sizes at the two wavelengths are very well matched : @xmath52 at 6 cm and @xmath53 at 20 cm .",
    "flux uncertainties are typically @xmath54% , and the 3@xmath31 rms noise levels are @xmath45  60 and 50 @xmath46jy for the 20 and 6  cm data , respectively . at the adopted distance of 5.1 mpc @xcite , 1 jy @xmath55  erg  s@xmath22  hz@xmath22 .",
    "these observations have also been analyzed by @xcite , who derive a luminosity function for h region candidates with a power - law index at 6  cm of @xmath56 , but exclude sources with spectral indices of @xmath57 . as result , the most optically thick sources were excluded from their sample .",
    "never the less , the seven sources presented in @xcite with @xmath0 are also included in this paper ( our sources 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 10 in tables  [ tbl-3 ] and [ n6946.tab ] ) .",
    "our primary tool for distinguishing udhs from other types of radio sources , such as supernovae remnants ( snr ) , is the radio spectral index @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 ) .",
    "while optically thin sources have @xmath60 , optically thick sources have @xmath61 ( @xmath58 approaches 2 in the black body limit ) , and typical non - thermal objects have @xmath62 .",
    "unfortunately , not all snrs obey this convention  in particular , there is a class of `` composite '' or `` plerionic '' snrs ( as coined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are known to have atypically flat spectral indices ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "in fact , in the first few hundred days after a supernova explosion , @xmath58 can actually be positive @xcite .",
    "however , given this extremely short timescale , we would have to be extremely fortunate ( or unfortunate ) to have one of these objects contained in our sample .",
    "a second set of observations taken with adequate time separation , such as those employed by @xcite would resolve this issue with confidence .",
    "consequently , in order to select udh candidates from the radio data , we have applied the condition that these sources must have radio spectral indices @xmath0 ( higher fluxes at shorter wavelengths ) .",
    "this criterion should exclude most other classes of radio - emitting objects , but it may also exclude genuine udh regions depending upon the exact instrumental angular resolution and frequencies observed .",
    "for example , low - frequency observations of optically thick thermal sources could be contaminated by steep - spectrum non - thermal sources , such as snrs , and thus fail the @xmath0 test , especially at longer wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , more distant sources , or sources observed using beam sizes larger than the thermal emitting region , may be contaminated by steep - spectrum , non - thermal background emission that dominates the disks and halos of most galaxies . both of these effects will act to disguise an optically thick thermal bremsstrahlung signature .",
    "thermal sources with the lowest emission measure , and thus the lowest free - free optical depth will be affected most strongly .",
    "sources with the highest emission measures are more likely to maintain a positive spectral signature and be correctly identified .",
    "fortunately , it is precisely these sources with high emission measures that are most likely to host ultra - young stellar clusters .    because we are relying on relative fluxes at different frequencies to identify s ,",
    "it is critical that we understand the impact of beam sizes on these flux measurements . in some cases ( as for ngc  6946 ) , the multifrequency observations were done in different array configurations to match beam sizes at different frequencies .",
    "however , in some observations presented here the beam sizes are not well matched ( as for m33 ) . in these cases ,",
    "typically a single configuration is used for all frequencies causing the beam size at the higher frequency to be smaller than the beam size at lower frequency .",
    "if the object ( ) is point - like with respect to the beams , the larger ( lower frequency ) beam will contain more non - thermal background contribution ( as discussed above ) , which can only cause these objects to appear _ less _ thermal .",
    "if the object is extended , the lower frequency beam will contain more flux from the same physical environment than the higher frequency beam  again , artificially boosting the relative flux at the lower frequency , and also causing the object to appear _ less _ thermal .",
    "in other words , if the beam size at lower frequencies is larger than the beam size at higher frequencies ( as is the case for the mis - matched beams in this paper ) , it will only disguise the optically thick signature of s and _ not _ artificially imitate an optically thick thermal spectral index .",
    "the condition that udh candidates must have positive spectral indices has resulted in the detection of fourteen sources in m33 , five sources in ngc  253 , and sixteen sources in ngc  6946 .",
    "these sources are listed in tables  [ tbl-1 ]  [ tbl-3 ] along with their spectral indices ( @xmath58 , where @xmath16 ) . within the uncertainties ,",
    "eight of these objects are not inconsistent with having @xmath64 , and we can not rule out an optically thin  region as the source .",
    "the remaining twenty - seven objects are only consistent with having an optically thick origin , and we consider these sources to be strong candidates for having an -like origin . @xcite have previously discussed the brightest of these five sources in ngc  253 ( source # 3 in this paper ) .",
    "their derived properties ( @xmath65  s@xmath22 , size @xmath66  pc , @xmath67  @xmath3  pc , and @xmath68  @xmath10 ) are in excellent agreement with the values we derive for this object in this section . however , the properties of the other four sources were not discussed , and we wish to add these sources to the current sample of s in the literature .      as the gas and dust associated with s dissipates and the extinction lessens , these objects will become more easily visible in optical light . on the other hand , s will become less obvious in radio observations as their ambient densities decrease and their thermal bremsstrahlung emission decreases as a result .",
    "_ consequently , optical surveys of regions will be biased against detecting the youngest regions and radio surveys will tend to miss the older regions . _    therefore , in order to understand how these udh candidates are related to star formation , past or present , it is useful to examine optical images near the source positions . in most cases , this comparison reveals whether the  regions are associated with star formation visible in optical light , diffuse h emission , or are completely obscured in this wavelength regime . in making such comparisons in crowded fields",
    ", we must keep in mind that the radio positions are no better than about half a beam width , e.g. , @xmath69 in m33 , @xmath70 in ngc  6946 , and sub - arcsecond in ngc  253 . to make these comparisons ,",
    "we have tied the coordinate system of the optical images to the _ hst _ guide star `` system . ''",
    "this leads to small internal errors ( @xmath71 rms ) within a galaxy , but it is well known that the same star will have coordinates that may differ by @xmath72 or more from plate to plate in the guide star catalog .",
    "we thus expect systematic offsets between the optical and radio positions by as much as @xmath73 .",
    "this is possibly an overestimate , but we can not rule out the physical correspondence of optical and radio sources within the astrometric uncertainty .    the locations of the udh regions in m33 were compared with b - band images from the 0.9 m telescope on kitt peak ; see @xcite for a complete description of the observations .",
    "we also searched the catalogs of h regions in m33 given by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "m33 is rich in h regions , and all of the udhs are possibly associated with previously known h regions , although in some cases the connection is insecure ( table  [ m33.tab ] ) .",
    "however , only about half of the udhs appear to be associated with stellar light apparent in the b - band image .",
    "the locations of the detected udhs with respect to the b - band image are shown in figure  [ m33bband ] .",
    "the radio observations of ngc  253 were compared to archival f656n ( narrow - band h@xmath58 ) and f814w ( i - band ) hubble space telescope images ( figure  [ n253 ] ) . while there is diffuse emission in the vicinity of all five udhs in this galaxy , only one of them ( source # 2 )",
    "is clearly identified with a compact optical object .",
    "these results are presented in table  [ n253.tab ] .    for ngc  6946",
    ", we compare the locations of the thermal radio sources with optical r - band and h@xmath58 images previously published by @xcite ( figure  [ n6946 ] ) .",
    "however , because of the large angular size of the galaxy ( @xmath74 ) this image does not have a wide enough field to contain all of the radio sources .",
    "therefore , we also use images from the the stsci digitized sky survey for comparison in these cases ( figure  [ n6946dss ] ) .",
    "about half of the sources in ngc  6946 have possible optical counterparts or diffuse emission , and the remaining half have neither .",
    "while the sources for which there are no obvious optical counterparts must be deeply enshrouded , and therefore are likely to be extremely young , it is nt clear whether detection of light in the optical regime rules out extreme youth for udh regions .",
    "we make this tentative statement for several reasons : ( 1 ) in most cases presented in this sample , the identification of an optical counterpart is insecure due to the possible systematics between the optical and radio positions , as well as the relatively large synthesized radio beam - width for m33 ; ( 2 ) in cases where individual stars are resolved ( m33 ) , the _ number _ of stars required to create the lyman continuum flux are not apparent in the optical images , suggesting either a misidentification due to pointing uncertainty , or a number of the individual stars are , in fact , still enshrouded .",
    "this scenario has actually been observed in the galactic  complex w49a where _ some _ of the stars in the complex appear to have emerged from their birth cocoons while the rest of the complex remains enshrouded @xcite ; and ( 3 ) if the dominant source of opacity is thompson scattering ( and not dust ) , a source with a radius of 5 pc could have electron densities as high as @xmath75  @xmath10 and still have opacities as low as @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the possible identification of optical counterparts does not preclude the youth of these objects .",
    "however , the sources for which there are no optical counterparts are more likely deeply embedded in their natal molecular clouds , and therefore extremely young .",
    "given the luminosities and radio spectral energy distributions of  regions , their physical parameters such as size and electron density can be estimated . using the analytical approximation of @xcite , we can estimate the emission measure , @xmath77 , given an electron temperature , @xmath78 , the observing frequency , @xmath79 , and the optical depth at that frequency .",
    "@xmath80^{1.35 } \\left[\\frac{\\nu}{({\\rm ghz})}\\right]^{2.1}\\tau .\\ ] ]    the positive spectral index for these sources arises from free - free emission where @xmath81 , therefore we assume @xmath82 as a lower limit .",
    "the electron temperature of galactic s is typically @xmath83  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we adopt for this estimate .",
    "the resulting emission measures for each of the wavelengths used in this sample range from @xmath84  @xmath3  pc ( for @xmath85 these emission measures will be correspondingly higher ) .",
    "although the radio maps constrain the size of the emitting region only weakly   pc in the case of ngc  253 , @xmath86 pc in the case of m  33 , and @xmath87 pc in the case of ngc  6946 ] , it is clear that electron densities in excess of 1000  @xmath10 are required to produce the observed emission measures . for comparison ,",
    "typical giant  regions observed optically have electron densities @xmath88  @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in order to better constrain the properties of the  regions , following @xcite we have modeled  regions as homogeneous spheres of plasma with uniform electron density and temperatures of 8000 k. only free - free emission and absorption processes are considered .",
    "varying the radius , @xmath89 , and electron density , @xmath90 , we modeled the radio spectral energy distribution resulting from thermal bremsstrahlung emission and self - absorption .",
    "these results are illustrated in figures  [ m33.plot]-[n6946.plot ] along with the data from tables  13 .",
    "figure  5 shows the 20 cm and 6 cm observations of  regions in m33 along with two sets of model  regions spectral energy distributions .",
    "different symbols distinguish the  candidates from table  1 .",
    "solid lines show  region models with electron densities of @xmath91  @xmath10 and radii of 0.7  pc and 1.9  pc . although the modeled luminosities closely match the observed luminosities , the spectral index of these models is generally steeper than the data . a second class of models with electron densities of @xmath92  @xmath10 and radii of 1.5  pc to 3.0  pc",
    "more closely match the observed spectral indices and luminosities . in the case of ngc  6946 ,",
    "densities of 1500  @xmath10 to 5000  @xmath10 fit the 20  cm and 6  cm data for radii ranging from 2  pc to 7  pc ( only a representative range of data from table  3 are plotted ) . in the case of ngc  253",
    ", observations reveal that the  regions are optically thick at frequencies as high as 15 ghz .",
    "figure  [ n253.plot ] illustrates that electron densities between 10,000  @xmath10 and 15,000  @xmath10 are required to fit the data .",
    "not only are the  regions in ngc  253 intrinsically more luminous than in the other two galaxies , they also have higher densities .",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether the simple homogeneous sphere models presented here are sufficient to infer the physical characteristics ( sizes , densities ) of the s. realistically , we expect that the radio sources identified as s are not simply monolithic dense  regions .",
    "rather , we expect that they are collections of several hundred ultra - compact  regions ( @xmath93  @xmath94  pc ) embedded in a more tenuous inter-  medium ( see [ w49a ] ) . however , two galaxies , ngc 253 ( ulvestad & antonucci 1997 ) and ngc 5253 ( turner  1999 ) are near enough and have observations with high enough resolution that the radio imaging can directly constrain the sizes of the emitting regions without recourse to model assumptions . in both cases ,",
    "our simple homogeneous spherical models described above produce size estimates in excellent agreement with the high - resolution radio maps .",
    "the deconvolved diameters of the radio sources in ngc 253 are 2 - 4 pc , in excellent agreement with the best - fitting models shown in figure  [ n253.plot ] . in ngc 5253",
    ", the single  radio source has a deconvolved diameter of 1 - 2 pc @xcite , consistent with the expectations of the simple model predictions based on the observed radio luminosities of turner ( 1998 ) . as further support for our simple models ,",
    "recently @xcite have made slightly more sophisticated multi - density models for radio recombination line observations of he  2 - 10 and and ngc  5253 ; their results are in excellent agreement with the results we find with our simple models .",
    "given the agreement in these two nearby cases , we believe that the simple two - parameter models are sufficiently instructive to make meaningful inferences about the sizes and densities of s based on radio continuum luminosities . more realistic models would include an arbitrary number of  regions within each each with its own density profile , and an inter-  medium with a specified density profile and temperature distribution .",
    "however , relaxing the simple two - parameter approach results in the number of free parameters and computational complexity growing rapidly .",
    "the production rate of lyman continuum photons , and , thus , the stellar content of each  region can be estimated from the thermal radio luminosity following @xcite , @xmath95 since the non - thermal component becomes weaker at higher frequencies , for each of the s in this sample we use the luminosity measured at the highest frequency in each data set to determine @xmath96 .",
    "the resulting values determined from this method are presented in tables  [ tbl-1 ]    [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "one should also bear in mind that the @xmath96 values determined with this method could suffer from two different problems : ( 1 ) if the source is , in fact , optically thick even at the highest frequencies measured , this method will _ underestimate _ the actual ionizing luminosity , and ( 2 ) if there is contamination from background non - thermal emission in the beam at the frequency used , the ionizing luminosity will be _",
    "overestimated_. while these two issues have an opposite affect on @xmath96 , we can not determine the magnitude of either with the data presently available .",
    "the production rate of lyman continuum photons from these sources can be used to estimate the number of massive stars powering the observed emission . following the convention of @xcite , a `` typical '' o - star ( type o7v ) produces @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath96 values in tables  [ tbl-1]-[tbl-3 ] can be directly translated into the number of `` equivalent '' o7v stars ( o7v * ) . using this method",
    ", we see that the udh regions in this sample have @xmath98 o7v * stars in m33 , @xmath99 in ngc  253 , and @xmath100 in ngc  6946 .",
    "moreover , the _ total _ stellar mass of these objects can be estimated using the starburst99 models of @xcite with solar metallicity , salpeter imf , and lower and upper mass cutoffs of @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively ( decreasing the lower mass limit will increase the total stellar mass estimate ) . using these parameters , star clusters producing this range of lyman continuum photons at ages",
    "@xmath103  myr would have total masses of @xmath104 .",
    "these @xmath96 and mass values are smaller than those found for the udhs in ngc  5253 @xcite , henize  2 - 10 @xcite , and ngc  2146 @xcite , which have @xmath105 o7v * stars and masses @xmath106 .",
    "this is not a surprising result ",
    "it is likely that we will only find massive star clusters forming in intense starburst events ; @xcite have demonstrated the need for extremely high - pressure environments , such as those found in starburst galaxies , to produce bound massive star clusters .",
    "however , in less formidable environments , we should expect to find a continuous range of s  from single s and  complexes ( such as those found in the galaxy ) , to the massive bound clusters ( such as those found in ngc  5253 , henize  2 - 10 , and ngc  2146 ) that may evolve into globular clusters .",
    "the sample presented in this article is beginning to fill in this continuum of objects .",
    "one of the most well studied  complexes in the galaxy is w49a , which makes it well suited for comparison to the  regions in this sample .",
    "first detected by westerhout ( 1958 ) in his radio survey , w49a has since been resolved into at least 30  regions @xcite , and is estimated to have @xmath107 o7v * stars @xcite .",
    "it also appear that a few of the stars in w49a have begun to emerge from their birth cocoons while the rest of the cluster remains deeply enshrouded @xcite .",
    "w49a is @xmath108 pc in diameter @xcite , and would fit within the beam sizes utilized in this paper if located at the same distances as the galaxies in this sample ; w49a would have angular sizes of @xmath109 @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , respectively , in m33 , ngc  253 , and ngc  6946 . because w49a is significantly closer , than the galaxies presented in this paper , any observations we use for comparison need to be at sufficiently low resolution as to include the entire w49a region .",
    "this condition is well - satisfied by the pioneering observations of @xcite , who obtained @xmath113 resolution radio maps of w49a at several wavelengths .    in figure",
    "[ w49a.plot ] , we present the radio spectral energy distribution of w49a @xcite in comparison to the _ mean _  region from m33 , ngc  253 , and ngc  6946 .",
    "it is clear that the integrated radio spectral energy distribution of w49a is almost identical to those of the  regions in this sample .",
    "figure  [ histograms ] shows histrograms of the 6  cm luminosities for the sources in m33 and ngc  6946 and the 3.6  cm luminosities ( 6  cm data is not included in this sample ) for ngc  253 along with an arrow indicating the luminosity of w49a . comparing the luminosity of w49a to those of the regions in m33",
    ", it is clear that w49a is up to 10 times _ more _ luminous than the m33 sources . in ngc",
    "6946 w49a would be one of the more luminous  regions .",
    "however , in the case of ngc  253 , w49a would be one of the _ least _ luminous objects  a magnitude or more fainter than the most luminous  regions detected in this galaxy .    the dotted line in figure  [ histograms]a illustrates the luminosity function of optically selected  regions in m33 @xcite who find @xmath114 .",
    "this comparison shows that the luminosity function of  regions is consistent with the normal  region luminosity function , suggesting that the s are simply a phase in the formation of many , perhaps most ,  regions .",
    "furthermore , if the formation of massive star clusters is primarily related to the intensity of the star formation a galaxy is currently undergoing , it is not surprising that the regions in m33 and ngc  6946 are similar to the complexes in the milky way which has a similar star formation rate .",
    "ngc  253 , by contrast , has a much higher star formation rate based on its fir luminosity , although high visual extinctions make the @xmath115 luminosities very uncertain .",
    "it certainly contains a more intense starburst , which is also in accord with the more massive udh regions it hosts .",
    "it seems likely that the fraction of time a super star cluster spends in the  phase is a small fraction of the massive star lifetime , perhaps 10 - 15% , in accord with the estimated lifetimes of individual regions based on the number of  regions compared with the number of optically visible o stars in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed ,  region lifetimes have been a topic of much discussion since @xcite introduced the `` lifetime problem '' ; in short , if  regions are significantly overpressured with respect to the surrounding ism , they should expand and dissipate on time scales @xmath116  years . however , the number of regions observed is greater than is allowed for by this time scale .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to address this issue , most of which are likely to also be applicable to s. @xcite proposed that infalling matter or bow shocks might act to increase the external pressure , thus extending the  phase .",
    "it is also possible that the ambient pressure is typically significantly higher than the value used by @xcite as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of  regions could also be extended if they are replenished by material photoevaporated from the surrounding circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the first argument for the extreme youth of  regions is simply by analogy to  regions in the galaxy .",
    "if s are composed of individual  regions , we should expect them to have similar lifetimes provided that star formation is relatively instantaneous over the massive star cluster . as is the case for  regions ,",
    "the densities in s are extremely high , and the implied pressures constitute an over - pressure compared to typical ism pressures .",
    "to first order , such over - pressed regions must expand and disperse on time scales comparable to the sound - crossing time scale which is a few@xmath117 yr ( see kobulnicky & johnson 1999 for more complete details ) .",
    "however , as discussed above for  regions , it is entirely possible that the ambient pressure around s is not `` typical '' of the global ism .    the second piece of evidence suggesting extreme youth is the fraction of ionizing stars in  regions compared to the fraction of ionizing stars in conventional  regions",
    ". for m33 and ngc  6946 the minimum implied total lyman continuum photon production rate , @xmath118 , of the  regions is @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively ( provided there is no leakage from the enshrouding cocoon that would likely result in associated h@xmath58 emission ) .",
    "the total @xmath118 for the entire galaxy is @xmath121 for m33 and @xmath122 for ngc  6946 ( kennicutt 1983 scaled to our adopted distance ) .",
    "thus , the  regions contain 1% and 7% of the total ionizing photons .",
    "if the star formation has been reasonably continuous in these systems , a plausible estimate for the typical duration of the  phase is 0.01 and 0.07 times the typical  region lifetime ( @xmath123 yr ) .",
    "this implies a mean age of less than 1 myr for  regions .",
    "the third , and perhaps weakest , piece of evidence in favor of the extreme youth of  regions comes from their high visual extinctions . in this article",
    ", we note that many of the ionizing star clusters within the  regions are not visible at optical wavelengths .",
    "in some cases , only diffuse @xmath115 emission is seen .",
    "sams  ( 1994 ) show that in ngc  253 , the extinctions due to dust reach local maxima , as high as @xmath124 mag at the positions of the radio sources we have identified as  regions .",
    "this picture is consistent with s being extremely young  regions still hidden from view by the dust associated with their natal molecular clouds .",
    "however , one must also bear in mind that we can not rule out screens of dust not physically associated with the regions of optically thick free - free emission .",
    "we expect that deliberate radio continuum searches will continue to find  regions in all galaxies with sufficiently high levels of recent star formation .",
    "it is becoming clear that we are seeing a _ continuum _ of sizes and luminosities for extragalactic massive star clusters in the earliest stages of their evolution .",
    "we predict that the natal cocoons of  regions should be prodigious emitters in the mid- to far - infrared regimes .",
    "in fact , mid- to far- infrared observations will allow us to search for an _ even earlier _ stage of massive star cluster evolution ; before the stars have begun ionizing their surrounding ism , they should go through a `` hot core '' phase , analogous to individual massive stars in the galaxy",
    ". this phase will be defined by extremely dense and warm gas that is not associated with strong free - free emission .",
    "therefore , further study of these sources will be greatly enhanced by upcoming mid- to far - infrared telescope missions , such as the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) .",
    "recognition of the ubiquity of the  phase of massive star formation pushes one step closer to understanding the genesis mechanisms of all star clusters , from small associations to giant proto - globular clusters .",
