    "recently the detection of b - mode from cmb by the bicep2 group @xcite has indicated a strong evidence of inflation @xcite , which solves many theoretical puzzles in the big bang cosmology .",
    "the b - mode polarization can be only generated by the tensor perturbations . according to the reports of the bicep2 experiment ,",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio is in range : @xmath5 cl ) .    in a simplest slow - roll inflation model ,",
    "the early universe was driven by a single scalar field @xmath6 with a very flat potential @xmath7 .",
    "usually , we call this field the inflaton .",
    "although there are many inflation models in the market , we still do not well - understand what is the inflaton .",
    "the most economical and fundamental candidate for the inflaton is the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , which has been already observed by the collider experiment lhc in 2012 @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "higgs inflation is a simple and elegant model .",
    "however , it is not easy for the higgs boson to realize a inflation model with correct density perturbations . to see this",
    ", we estimate the inflaton mass from the amplitude @xmath8 of the scalar perturbation power spectrum in the chaotic inflation model @xcite with a quadratic potential @xmath9 : @xmath10 which is many orders of magnitude larger than the observed higgs mass , @xmath11 gev . in other words ,",
    "the potential of higgs field @xmath12 is not flat enough to realize an inflation . by introducing a non - minimal coupling to the gravity ( @xmath13 )",
    ", one could indeed achieve such a flat potential @xcite after a conformal transformation . and",
    "the predictions of this kind of non - minimal coupling higgs inflation are well consistent with observations before bicep2 .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite have found that this model can not accommodate the new measurement from bicep2 , because it generally predicts a small amplitude of tensor perturbations .",
    "an alternative higgs inflation model was proposed in ref.@xcite , in which the higgs boson kinetic term is non - minimally coupled to the einstein tensor ( @xmath14 ) . according to the recent analysis on this model @xcite",
    ", it predicts @xmath15 when the number of e - folds @xmath16 , since @xmath17 in this model .",
    "however , to overcome the problems in the big bang theory , the number of e - folds is required to be around @xmath18 , then the tensor - to - scalar ratio becomes even smaller , say @xmath19 .    another interesting higgs inflation model called the higgs chaotic inflation",
    "is proposed in ref.@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the sm higgs boson realizes the quadratic chaotic inflation model , based on the so - called running kinetic inflation @xcite .",
    "the kinetic term of the inflaton is significantly modified at large field values , while it becomes the canonical one when @xmath12 is small .",
    "the value of @xmath0 in this model is the same as that in the chaotic inflation model with a quadratic potential , i.e. @xmath20 . for @xmath21 , it predicts @xmath22 , but if we require a larger @xmath0 , say @xmath1 , a smaller @xmath23 is needed , say @xmath24 , which is a little better than that predicted in the other higgs inflation models , see ref.@xcite for recent revisited in this model .",
    "it seems that the higgs chaotic inflation is a charming higgs inflation model in the market .    on the other hand , there is a challenge for a single field inflation with bicep2 result . for the chaotic inflation ,",
    "the larger the value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio is , the smaller the value of the running of the spectral index is , see the details in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , to be more consistent with observations , one might consider a little more beyond a single inflation model . among many choices , the cosmological constant",
    "is often forgotten when one building an inflation model , since by itself only the exact scale - invariant harrizon - zeldovish power spectrum with the scalar spectral index @xmath25 could be produced , which is already ruled out at over @xmath26 by _ planck _ @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the situation is changed when the early universe is dominated by the cosmological constant as well as the inflaton",
    ". it could give @xmath27 , @xmath1 when the number of e - folds is not so small , say @xmath3 , and it also predict the correct magnitude of the spectrum amplitude .",
    "in the following , we will assume that the running kinetic approach is a correct way to realize inflation by sm higgs boson and we also assume that both inflaton and the cosmological constant dominated the universe during the inflation time . in next section , we give a briefly review of the running kinetic inflation and then we pursue the role played by the cosmological constant during inflation .",
    "finally , we will draw our conclusions and give some discussions in the last section .",
    "the running kinetic inflation can be easily implemented in supergravity by assuming a shift symmetry exhibiting itself in the khler potential at high energy scales , while this symmetry is explicitly broken and therefore becomes much less prominent at low energy scales . in the unitary gauge",
    ", one can write down the lagrangian for the higgs boson @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath28 the effect of non - canonical kinetic term is significant for large @xmath29 .",
    "the kinetic term grows as @xmath30 , that is why the name `` running kinetic inflation '' . by redefining the higgs field",
    ", one can rewrite the lagrangian in terms of canonically normalized field @xmath31 with the effective potential @xmath32 thus , the quadratic chaotic inflation occurs .",
    "assuming the universe was dominated by both the inflaton and the cosmological constant , the friedmann equation could be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "then by using definition of the slow - roll parameters , we get @xmath35 and also the amplitude of the scalar perturbation power spectrum is given by @xmath36 which is defined as @xmath37 . by using the relations @xmath38 with @xmath39 the scalar spectrum index and @xmath40 with @xmath0 the tensor - to - scalar ratio , we obtain the inflaton mass in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath8 : @xmath42 and also the value of the cosmological constant : @xmath43 \\,.\\ ] ] the number of e - folds could be also given by @xmath44 by using eqs.([equ : fcc ] ) , ( [ equ : fn ] ) and the value of @xmath6 : @xmath45 obtained from eqs.([equ : sl1 ] ) , ( [ equ : sl2 ] ) and ( [ equ : amp ] ) , we get    @xmath46 \\bigg\\ } \\,.\\ ] ]    substituting the observed values of @xmath27 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 into eq.([equ : fmass ] ) , we estimated the mass of the inflaton as @xmath49 gev . if @xmath50 is sufficiently large , say @xmath51 in eq.([equ : potential ] ) , the quartic coupling could be @xmath52 , which is required to explain the correct electroweak scale and the higgs boson mass @xmath53 .",
    "the large value of @xmath50 could be understood in terms of symmetry , see refs.@xcite for details .",
    "the scale of the cosmological constant can be estimated from eq.([equ : fcc ] ) , @xmath54 . as usual , the fine - tuning problem of the cosmological constant still exist at later time .",
    "alternatively , one can consider some dynamical dark energy models instead , which are more like a cosmological constant component at early time .    from eq.([equ",
    ": fn2 ] ) , we obtain the number of e - folds as @xmath55 , which looks enough to solve the horizon problem , the flat problem etc . in the big bang cosmology . in other words ,",
    "the model could predict @xmath1 and @xmath56 by given @xmath3 .",
    "of course , the cosmological constant and the mass of the inflaton should take the values estimated above . from fig.[fig : nl ] , one can see that the value of @xmath23 increases with @xmath57 for small @xmath57 values , while it decreases for large @xmath57 values .",
    "this could be easy to understand : when @xmath57 is small , we have @xmath58 , see eqs.([equ : fmass ] ) , ( [ equ : fcc ] ) and ( [ equ : fphi ] ) , then @xmath59 .",
    "but when @xmath57 is large , we have @xmath60 , then @xmath61 , which approaches to zero when @xmath57 goes to infinity .    the number of e - folds @xmath23 v.s .",

    "lensing power spectrum , and bao data gives the constraint on the index @xmath39 of the scalar power spectrum@xcite : @xmath66(__planck__+ wp ) , @xmath67 ( _ _ planck__+wp+lensing ) , @xmath68 ( _ _ planck__+wp+highl ) , @xmath69 ( _ planck _",
    "+ wp+bao ) .",
    "it also gives an upper bound on @xmath70 .",
    "the bicep2 experiment constraints the tensor - scalar - ratio as : @xmath71 in ref.@xcite .",
    "they are also other groups have reported their constrain results on the ratio : @xmath72 in ref.@xcite by adopting the background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization ( b2 ) , _ planck _ and wp data sets ; @xmath73 in ref.@xcite combined with the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) ; @xmath74 in ref.@xcite by adopting the _ planck _ , supernova _",
    "union2.1 _ compilation , bao and bicep2 data sets ; and also @xmath75 in ref.@xcite with other bao data sets .",
    "this b - mode signal can not be mimicked by topological defects@xcite .",
    "the most likely origin of this signal is from the tensor perturbations or the gravitational wave polarizations during inflation .    here",
    ", one can see that the cosmological constant plays an important role .",
    "it helps the universe to inflate at early time and contributes to the number of e - folds though eq.([equ : fn ] ) . as a result , the inflaton field @xmath6 could be smaller than that without @xmath57 . to see this , we estimate @xmath76 from eq.([equ : fphi ] ) , while @xmath77 without @xmath57 .",
    "then , the slow - roll parameter @xmath78 could become also larger , which will then enhance the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath79 , see fig.[fig : rl ] .",

    "the recent detection of b - mode by bicep2 indicates an exciting leap forward in our ability to explore the early universe and fundamental physics .",
    "the measurement of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath80 shows a very powerful constraint to theoretical inflation models .",
    "higgs boson is the most likely candidate of the inflaton field .",
    "however , its mass @xmath81 gev is much smaller than that for a inflaton @xmath82 gev . to solve this hierarchy problem ,",
    "a non - minimal coupling between the higgs boson and gravity or a non - canonical kinetic term is needed .",
    "usually , these higgs inflation models predict a small value of @xmath0 , which is not quite consistent with the results from bicep2 . in this paper",
    ", we explored whether a cosmological constant energy component is needed to improve the situation . and we found the answer is yes .",
    "the higgs chaotic inflation now predicts @xmath1 , @xmath2 with e - folds number @xmath3 , which is large enough to overcome the problems in the big bang cosmology .",
    "however , we are still far from understanding the cosmological constant .",
    "and we havent solve its fine - tuning problem in the later time evolution of the universe , which is asked why the present value of the cosmological constant is so small , or why the universe is accelerating at present @xmath83 .",
    "noticed that the slow - roll parameters have a finite maximum value from eqs.([equ : sl1 ] ) and ( [ equ : sl2 ] ) as long as @xmath84 : @xmath85 when @xmath86 , and @xmath87 when @xmath88 .",
    "it seems that the inflation will never end if @xmath89 . to end the inflation ,",
    "one may need a phase transition of a heavy higgs boson @xmath90 with its mass at gut scale , and it also slightly couples to the light one that responsible to inflation by @xmath91 . at the beginning of inflation ,",
    "the heavy higgs boson is stable at its true vacuum ( @xmath92 ) , then it only contributes a constant potential , which can be regarded as the cosmological constant .",
    "when the inflaton rolls down the potential and becomes small enough , the vacuum at @xmath92 turns to be a false one and the heavy boson would be no longer stable , then it rolls to true vacuum to end the inflation .",
    "in fact , the endless inflation is essentially due to the cosmological fine - tuning problem .",
    "once a correct mechanism is found to reduce @xmath57 to its present observational value , then the inflation would be certainly end",
    ". we will give a concrete example in detail to realize such a mechanism that may solve the fine - tuning problem in the later work @xcite .    the challenge for a single field inflation to predict a large value of the running of the index still exit , @xmath93 for @xmath80 in our case , see",
    "also ref.@xcite for detail discussions on this issue .",
    "but the constraint on the running is not so tight : @xmath94 from the analysis of _ planck _ data , see ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , if additional sterile neutrino species are taken into account in the universe , one could also obtain @xmath47 without the running of the spectral index ( @xmath95 ) , see refs.@xcite .",
    "certainly , if a large running is well - confirmed in future , then other mechanisms explain it are urgently needed .",
