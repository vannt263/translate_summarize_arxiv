    "boron-10 trifluouride , @xmath0bf@xmath1 , was first used in a neutron detector by amaldi _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite and for many years , until the availability of @xmath5he",
    ", it was commonly used in gaseous proportional counters to detect thermal neutrons .",
    "the advantage of @xmath0bf@xmath1 as a neutron detection medium is based on its relatively large thermal neutron capture cross - section , @xmath6 b @xmath7 @xmath8 , for the reactions : @xmath9 eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) describes the major reaction branch with a branching ratio of @xmath10.@xcite it is followed by prompt gamma emission according to eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] )    in traditional bf@xmath1 proportional counters , the energetic products of the reactions in eqs . ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) precipitate a cascade of gas ionization in applied electric fields of approximately 100 kv / m .",
    "the charged particles are then collected as a current pulse .",
    "in contrast , we aim to build a detector similar to that described in hughes _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite in which @xmath5he was mixed with various noble gases and irradiated with cold neutrons to produce the reaction : @xmath11 as the reaction products in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] deposit energy in the surrounding noble gas , excimers are produced .",
    "the excimers are loosely bound noble gas diatomic molecules that exist only in excited electronic states",
    ". noble gas excimers decay by emission of vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) radiation that can be detected as a signature of neutron absorption .",
    "hughes _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that tens of thousands of excimer vuv photons were generated per absorbed neutron , and in some cases approximately 30 % of the net nuclear reaction energy was channeled into vuv emissions by this process .",
    "_ @xcite found that around ten thousand vuv excimer photons could be generated per absorbed neutron for neutrons incident upon a thin film of boron in a noble gas near atmospheric pressure .",
    "the success of these experiments was contingent upon the transparency of the heavy noble gases to their own excimer radiation .",
    "the measurements described here were motivated by concerns about vuv absorption by bf@xmath1 , which if sufficiently strong would disqualify bf@xmath1 as a substitute for @xmath5he in the arrangement described in ref .  .",
    "measurements of the absolute photoabsorption cross section of bf@xmath1 were performed on beamline 4 ( bl-4 ) @xcite of the synchrotron ultraviolet radiation facility ( surf iii ) at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) . the the gas handling system is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] and optical system used to perform these measurements is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .      due to the hazards of the sample gas , several remarks are in order .",
    "boron has two stable isotopes , of mass number 10 and 11 , with relative terrestrial abundances of approximately 19.9 % and 80.1 % , respectively.@xcite only @xmath0b absorbs low energy neutrons , thus bf@xmath1 gas enriched in @xmath0b to @xmath12 % by weight was used for these measurements .",
    "this sample had miscellaneous impurities of approximately 0.01 % , according to the supplier s",
    "assay.@xcite bf@xmath1 is non - flammable ; has a pungent , suffocating odor ; and is a major inhalation and contact hazard with a toxicity threshold of 0.0001 % .",
    "it reacts with most metals with the exception of stainless steel and when exposed to moisture , borofluoric acid is formed.@xcite    during the measurements , the gas handling system , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , delivered @xmath0bf@xmath1 to the photoabsorption cell .",
    "the design of the system took full account of the toxic and corrosive properties of bf@xmath1 .",
    "the absorption cell and gas handling system used materials resistant to attack by bf@xmath1 , and the surface area of the system was minimized to reduce bf@xmath1 adsorption .",
    "connections between system components were made with metal seal vcr tube stainless steel fittings and conflat flanges.@xcite vcr seals between fittings and flanges were stainless steel or nickel - plated copper ; conflat seals were oxygen - free , high - conductivity copper .    before filling the absorption cell with @xmath0bf@xmath1 ,",
    "it and all associated gas lines were evacuated with a liquid nitrogen trapped turbo - molecular pump while being baked .",
    "ultimate base pressures of @xmath13 pa were routinely attained .",
    "after each set of absorption measurements , it was necessary to completely eliminate @xmath0bf@xmath1 from the absorption cell .",
    "this was done by first flushing the system with dry nitrogen to entrain the residual @xmath0bf@xmath1 and subsequently pumping the system , with the vacuum pump protected by the bf@xmath1 scrubber .",
    "the entrained @xmath0bf@xmath1 then passed through a commercial bf@xmath1 scrubber . ,",
    "cleanvent^tm^ , co2s , bf3 from clean systems , inc.@xcite the scrubber was made specifically for bf@xmath1 purging and has a capacity of 50 l of bf@xmath1 and a certified outlet concentration of 0.0001% bf@xmath1 .",
    "a continuous smart gas^tm^ monitoring system consisting of an electrochemical sensor cell with a full - scale sensitivity of 0.0003% bf@xmath1 was located at the wall of the evacuated containment chamber closest to the @xmath0bf3 cylinder .",
    "the system was set to sound an alarm at bf@xmath1 concentrations of 0.00005% .",
    "the outlet of the glove box as well as the exhausts of the pumps and the line to the absorption cell were all routed to the scrubber through a manifold .",
    "the outlet of the scrubber , cleaned of @xmath0bf3 was connected to the external ventilation system of the surf iii facility .",
    "the surf iii facility delivered radiation with a bandwidth of 0.25 nm from the electron storage ring to an absorption cell at an end station on the beamline designated bl-4 .",
    "@xcite a diagram of the radiation path is in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "starting at the electron storage ring , radiation was imaged onto the entrance aperture of a 2-m monochromator with grazing incidence pre - optics .",
    "radiation leaving the monochromator through the exit aperture was imaged , by two mirrors , onto the entrance window of the absorption cell .",
    "the absorption cell was mounted on a translation stage inside an evacuated chamber .",
    "a second chamber , located behind the exit window of the absorption cell , contained a detector for measuring the transmitted radiation .",
    "a beam splitter in front of the first evacuated chamber reflected a small fraction of the incident light to a monitor photodiode to correct the transmitted signal for source intensity drift .",
    "bl-4 is normally operated with a larger bandpass and hence more optical power .",
    "due to the reduced bandpass used in these experiments , the signal from the monitor photodiode was too low to use and , as discussed below , a different technique for source intensity drift correction was developed .",
    "translation of both the absorption cell and the transmitted radiation detector enabled alignment with the incident radiation .",
    "the absolute @xmath0bf@xmath1 photoabsorption cross section , @xmath14 , as a function of wavelength , @xmath15 , was determined by measuring the transmission coefficient , @xmath16 , of the gas at pressure @xmath17 . according to beer s law , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the photodiode signal from light transmitted by the @xmath0bf@xmath1 , @xmath20 is the photodiode signal from light transmitted by an evacuated absorption cell ( assuming a constant incident optical power ) , @xmath21 is the number density of absorbing atoms or molecules , @xmath22 is the path length of the incident radiation through the absorption cell , @xmath23 is the boltzman constant , and @xmath24 is the temperature . the final expression in eq .  [ eq5 ]",
    "is obtained by substituting @xmath25 for @xmath21 according to the ideal gas law .",
    "the pressure was measured with an industrial pressure transducer with a range of 0 to 300 kpa , an accuracy of 1.5% for pressures",
    "@xmath26 kpa , and a linearity of 0.2% .",
    "the path length , @xmath22 , of the cell was measured to better than 0.01 % .",
    "comparison of the ideal gas law to the virial equation using density , pressure , and temperature reference data for bf@xmath1 in the nist web thermo tables , @xcite showed agreement within 1 % over the range of the experimental pressures . because the evacuated absorption cell was used to measure @xmath20 , knowledge of the transmissions of the mgf@xmath27 entrance and exit windows of the absorption cell were not required , assuming that they remained constant over the duration of the measurements",
    "optical power levels used during the experiments were insufficient to darken the mgf@xmath27 .",
    "spectral scans were performed over a range of @xmath0bf@xmath1 pressures .",
    "the first scan of each series was performed with the absorption cell evacuated .",
    "the results of this scan provided the incident signal for the transmission measurements . following this scan ,",
    "the absorption cell was isolated from the vacuum pump , a measured pressure of @xmath0bf@xmath1 was admitted into the cell , and the spectral scan was repeated .",
    "subsequent scans were performed at @xmath0bf@xmath1 pressures up to 101.3 kpa .",
    "the cell was then cleared of @xmath0bf@xmath1 and evacuated to base pressure for the final scan .",
    "this second scan of the evacuated cell was necessary for the source intensity drift correction procedure described below .",
    "the electron beam current in the storage ring , and hence the intensity of the synchrotron radiation , decays approximately exponentially with a rate constant that can be determined from two scans of an evacuated absorption cell at two different times .",
    "the rate constant may then be used to correct measurements for decaying radiation intensity .",
    "the transmission of the @xmath0bf@xmath1 , @xmath16 , at a given pressure , @xmath17 , is determined by eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] using the corrected photocurrent for the input quantity @xmath19 .",
    "the use of the correction factor introduces an uncertainty of 2.5 % to 5 % in the determination of @xmath16 .",
    "uncertainties in the pressure measurements were negligible compared to those of the correction factor .",
    "the transmission data as a function of @xmath0bf@xmath1 pressure at each wavelength are fit to the functional form of beer s law to obtain values for the exponential @xmath28 .",
    "the cross section is then given by : @xmath29 seven sets of data were collected that consisted of measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at intervals of 0.25 nm for a range of @xmath0bf@xmath1 pressures .",
    "the first four sets of data , on four different dates , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . they were collected at @xmath0bf@xmath1 pressures of 23 , 45 , 140 , 225 , 450 , and 760 torr between 135 nm and 205 nm .",

    "these data revealed previously unreported absorption features in the regions 135 nm to 145 nm , 150 nm to 165 nm , and 190 nm to 205 nm .",
    "three additional sets of data were collected between 135 nm and 145 nm ( fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] ) at pressures of 380 , 460 , 530 , 600 , 680 , and 760 torr .    in the analysis that follows ,",
    "a resolved peak was identified by any series of at least three consecutive wavelengths where the measured cross section was greater than the background ( determined from the surrounding points ) by at least the standard uncertainty .",
    "identified peaks were fitted to a gaussian function to determine their center and width .",
    "the center of this fit was used as the wavelength for determination of the transition energy .",
    "the experimental results appear in figs .",
