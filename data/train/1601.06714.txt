    "the standard model ( sm ) of the particle physics is well - established and fits perfectly with almost all the experimental observations in the elementary particle physics .",
    "but there are several observations that the sm can not accommodate , such as neutrino masses , dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "accumulating evidences point to the existence of the dark matter , which is neutral , colorless , stable and weakly interacting matter that can not be seen with telescopes but accounts for about @xmath5 of the matter in the universe . in the sm , neutrinos are stable neutral particles , which turn out too light to be the full components of the dark matter . thus one needs new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the weakly interacting massive particle  ( wimp ) is a promising dark matter candidate , since it can naturally get the observed relic density for a wimp with mass around the electroweak scale .",
    "based on the interaction pattern of wimp with the sm particle @xmath6 , it catalyzed various @xmath6-portal dark matter models , of which the higgs portal dark matter models  @xcite became interesting and important since the discovery of the sm - like higgs at the lhc .",
    "but the conventional higgs portal dark matter is confronted with the tension between the correct dark matter relic density and constraints from underground direct detections .    to loose this tension",
    ", one needs further extensions to the minimal higgs portal dark matter models , for example adding parity - violating effective wimp - higgs interactions  @xcite , or including extra scalar mediators  @xcite that mixed with the sm higgs . in this paper , we provide insight into the higgs portal dark matter models to study possible scenarios that have negligible direct detection cross section .",
    "there are in general three types of such scenarios based on different dynamics of dark matter or higgs .",
    "the first scenario is the freeze - in dark matter  @xcite , which has a negligible initial thermal density and feeble interactions with the thermal bath that lead to the production of the dark matter as temperature drops below the dark matter mass . in this scenario ,",
    "the coupling of dark matter to the sm - like higgs is so small that the direct detection cross section can be negligible .",
    "the second scenario is two higgs doublets model ( 2hdm)-portal dark matter , in which dark matter may only interact with the scalar bilinear , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the higgs doublet in the higgs basis that gets no vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . in this case",
    "there is no tree - level contribution to the wimp - nucleus scattering , thus the direct detection cross section is negligible .",
    "a systematic study of the phenomenology arising from this model will be given in ref .",
    "the third scenario is hidden scalar mediated dark matter , which is the main subject of this paper .",
    "this scenario extends the sm with a complex scalar singlet , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is assumed to be the stable dark matter candidate , stabilized by the cp symmetry of the potential .",
    "the muting of the direct detection cross section in this scenario originates from the speciality of the minimization condition , where @xmath2 gets no vev but @xmath3 mixes with the sm higgs arising from the trilinear interaction . as a result there might be no tree level contribution to the scattering cross section of the wimp off nucleus and only quartic coupling is relevant to the wimp relic density .",
    "we perform a systematic study to this model and find that its direct detection cross sections is about @xmath11 orders below the current lux limit , providing a correct dark matter relic density .",
    "although it is difficult to detect this model in underground experiments , it is still possible to search for this model at the lhc or future cepc - sppc collider in the mono - higgs channel .",
    "our numerical simulations show that the production cross section of @xmath12 at the lhc with @xmath13 is about @xmath14 for a @xmath15 wimp .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows : we briefly describe our model in section ii and study constraints from higgs measurements in section iii .",
    "section iv is focused on the dark matter relic density and direct detection .",
    "we discuss collider signature of this model in section v. the last part is concluding remarks .",
    "we present an alternative dark matter model in the appendix .",
    "as was discussed in the introduction , the key point of avoiding the constraint of dark matter direct detection is introducing a hidden scalar mediator that mixes with the sm - like higgs but gets no vev . in this paper , we propose two alternative scenarios ( model a and model b ) , both of which may give rise to a scalar dark matter with correct relic density and escape from constraints given by underground dark matter direct detections in the meanwhile . the model",
    "a is more simple , we will focus on the phenomenology of it in this paper and leave the model b , which is given in the appendix , for a future study .",

    "the scalar potential can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the sm higgs .",

    "tadpole conditions can be written as @xmath21 for the following parameter settings @xmath22 one has @xmath23 and @xmath24 from precision measurements .",

    "<S> we investigate a higgs portal dark matter model by extending the standard model ( sm ) with a complex singlet , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a dark matter candidate and @xmath2 gets no vacuum expectation value but @xmath3 mixies with the sm higgs via a trilinear interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we point out an interesting scenario , where only quartic coupling contributes to the dark matter relic abundance and there is no tree level contribution to the direct detection . </S>",
    "<S> numerical analysis shows that the direction detection cross section , which arises at the one - loop level , is about @xmath4 orders below the current lux bound . </S>",
    "<S> constraints from higgs measurements as well as collider signatures of the model at the lhc are studied . </S>"
