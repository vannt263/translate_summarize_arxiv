    "the @xmath0-expansion proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite has been considered so far on the discretized back ground . in all applications of the method",
    ", the expansion in terms of the basic parameter has finite radius of convergence such as the strong coupling expansion in the field theoretic models on lattice and high temperature expansion in magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the existence of the non - zero convergence radius played an important role in the application of the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate whether the method is effective in asymptotic series appearing in perturbation expansion . here",
    "we will apply the method to two models , a mathematical function defined through laplace integral and the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator in which we focus on the computation of the ground state energy at strong coupling from the weak coupling perturbation theory to large perturbative orders .    before the argument , to avoid possible confusion , we like to rename the `` @xmath0-expansion '' used in @xcite to the `` generalized binomial transform '' due to the reason to be explained below : the anharmonic oscillator can be viewed as the euclidean @xmath1-dimensional @xmath2 field theory where we denote the space coordinate by @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian then reads @xmath4 the non - linear interaction is controlled by the coupling constant @xmath5 and the un - perturbed current mass is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the perturbation theory provides an expansion of any physical quantity in @xmath5 . due to the mass dimension",
    "@xmath7 carried by the coupling constant , expansion in @xmath5 is actually the expansion in @xmath8 which is dimensionless .",
    "thus it is apparent that the perturbative expansion is almost equivalent with the inverse - mass expansion",
    ". there exists a novel computational technique called `` linear delta ( @xmath0 ) expansion '' , `` optimized perturbation theory '' or `` variational perturbation theory '' @xcite . also the `` order dependent mapping ''",
    "@xcite is another adjacent method which includes `` linear delta ( @xmath0 ) expansion '' in a specific fixing of the mapping . in anharmonic oscillator , these techniques are similar to the `` @xmath0-expansion '' proposed in @xcite .",
    "the linear delta expansion introduces @xmath0 as the interpolating parameter by the substitutions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian to start with is @xmath11 notice that @xmath12 reduces the system to the free massive oscillator and @xmath13 to the massless anharmonic oscillator ( pure anharmonic oscillator ) .",
    "linear delta expansion regards @xmath14 as the unperturbed part and expand the perturbation @xmath15 $ ] as the power series in @xmath0 .",
    "the result shows the perturbative result of the interpolated system with the mass @xmath16 and the coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "then , setting @xmath13 , it is known that nontrivial and effective estimates of physical observables in the massless limit ( or the strong coupling limit ) are obtained .",
    "the concerned papers are quite many and see , for example , the paper @xcite and references therein . for the application of interpolating linear delta expansion on the lattice ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the `` @xmath0-expansion '' proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite has been derived in the similar technique .",
    "suppose that @xmath18 be given as the truncated series in @xmath19 to order @xmath20 , @xmath21 by the re - scaling of the argument @xmath22 , expanding @xmath23 in @xmath0 to the relevant order and setting @xmath13 , one obtains the @xmath0-expansion of @xmath24 as the function of @xmath25 ( see ( [ binomial ] ) ) .",
    "this technique is first used on the lattice as a tool of dilatation of the continuum scaling region , where the argument is basically related to the lattice spacing . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear delta - expansion is stemmed from the interpolation of two different systems .",
    "though the two tools share similar features and sometimes produce same results , they differ in the underlying concept and specific details , in particular when applied to physical systems on the lattice .",
    "this is the reason of renaming the `` @xmath0-expansion '' to `` generalized binomial transform '' or simply in short `` binomial transform ''",
    ".    it would be in order to review briefly the generalized binomial transform : in typical cases , the generalized binomial transform acts on the simple truncated power series ( [ series ] ) as @xmath26=\\sum_{n=0}^{n}a_{n}{n \\choose n}t^n . \\label{binomial}\\ ] ] that is , the coefficient @xmath27 in original series is multiplied by the binomial factor @xmath28 thus , the binomial transform denoted by @xmath29 is dependent on the perturbative order @xmath20 . for the sake of notational simplicity",
    ", we also use `` bar '' representing the transform , @xmath26:=\\bar f_{n}(t).\\ ] ]    at first sight , one may feel difficulty in recognizing the effectivity of @xmath30 in extracting the quantities , the limit @xmath31 when convergent and the critical exponent when divergent in power - like manner as @xmath32 . though @xmath30 is just a polynomial in @xmath25 , we found in some physics models that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath18 as @xmath32 is observable in @xmath30 at _ non - large @xmath25 region _ and marking quantities ( the limit and critical exponents ) can be estimated .",
    "for instance in the square ising model at temperature @xmath33 , the effective region of @xmath34=\\bar\\beta_{n}(t)$ ] in the @xmath35 is numerically assured to be @xmath36 @xcite over which the function exhibits an extremely flat plateau and the inverse critical temperature @xmath37 is indicated at the stationary or almost stationary point of the function @xmath38 . here",
    "the mass argument @xmath39 is composed by the magnetic susceptibility @xmath40 and the second moment @xmath41 as @xmath42 . for convergent series , it is implied that the limit @xmath43 $ ] is constant over @xmath44 for a certain @xmath45 and the function in the @xmath46 limit has the shape like the step function with finite range of @xmath47 .",
    "turning to the anharmonic oscillator , we deal with the perturbative expansion in powers of the coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "then , remembering that the ground state energy @xmath48 has an asymptotic expansion in @xmath8 with alternate sign , there are two crucial differences compared to the ising case and 2d large @xmath20 vector model discussed in refs .",
    "the first is that the expansion parameter has fractional powers of @xmath19 such as @xmath49 , @xmath50 and so on . to handle these terms , we use the generalized binomial factor , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is real or complex when convenient and necessary , and the transformation rule given by @xmath53={n \\choose s}t^s,\\quad m = m^2 . \\label{binomial3}\\ ] ] as we shall see in the next section , this rule is suitable when the function @xmath54 of interest allows mellin transform representation .",
    "second , as aforementioned , the original series has zero convergence radius and it is unclear at all whether the generalized binomial transform effectively works as before . in this paper , we will demonstrate that a careful use of the principle of minimum sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite provides an accurate sequence of estimates to large enough orders .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the second section , we apply the binomial transform to a mathematical function which allows divergent expansion such that @xmath55 and investigate in detail the computation of the limit @xmath56 from the divergent series .",
    "the technique of mellin transform representation is introduced to make the analysis transparent . from this example",
    ", one can gain concrete feeling of how binomial transform works . in the third section",
    ", we investigate the application of the binomial transform to the anharmonic oscillator .",
    "we first review weak coupling perturbation expansion and consider its transform . the linear delta - expansion is also mentioned and the difference is explained . explicit estimation will be worked out to the order @xmath57 .",
    "the sequence of the estimates indicates the strong evidence of the convergence to the most precise value to date , even though the region `` effective '' in the estimation shrinks as the order grows .",
    "also presented is the computation of the strong coupling coefficients and compared with those from the conventional linear delta expansion .",
    "the binomial transform related to the dilatation of the region around @xmath58 is finally investigated .",
    "the last section is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "in the use of transformation rule ( [ binomial3 ] ) to the closed form of function , mellin transform plays an important role . given a function @xmath24 as the argument @xmath39 , the representation through mellin transform reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 in ( [ mellin ] )",
    ", the integration contour in the complex @xmath52-plane is taken as the vertical one passing through @xmath61 and it is assumed that the integral ( [ mellin ] ) exists in a certain vertical strip including the point @xmath62 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath54 at small @xmath39 is given by the deformation of the contour to the left half - plane , by which residues at supposed poles leave the required series . as well , the expansion in @xmath63 is obtained by the deformation of the contour to the right half - plane .    when the mellin transform representation is available , the generalized binomial transform is easy to implement .",
    "we find the result from ( [ binomial3 ] ) @xmath64\\varphi(s)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{c - i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty}\\frac{ds}{2\\pi i}\\frac{\\gamma(n+1)}{\\gamma(s+1)\\gamma(n - s+1)}t^{s}\\varphi(s).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the kernel changes from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "deformation of the contour to the left half - plane gives the expansion of @xmath67 in @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the large @xmath39 behavior of @xmath54 corresponds to the small @xmath25 behavior of @xmath67 . if @xmath65 has single pole at @xmath69 for positive integer @xmath70 , expansion at small @xmath39 has the term @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast for @xmath67 , the corresponding @xmath72 term is absent since then the singularity is cancelled by @xmath73 . if @xmath65 has double poles at @xmath69 , then there appears @xmath74 , but for @xmath67 just a power - like term @xmath75 remains and the associated residue becomes @xmath76 where the expansion @xmath77 is supposed .",
    "it is crucial to note that the residue tends to vanish as @xmath78 as @xmath46 .",
    "surviving term is the residue at @xmath79 only , provided the pole is surrounded in the contour deformation .",
    "let us consider the mathematical function for @xmath80 defined through laplace integral given by @xmath81 the rotation of the integration contour on the complex @xmath82-plane reveals that the function @xmath54 can be analytically extended in the complex @xmath39-plane .",
    "one then finds that the origin is a branch point and the circulation around the origin creates @xmath83 , proving @xmath54 be a multi - valued function .    from the well known result of mellin transform , @xmath84>0,\\ ] ] we obtain the following representation , @xmath85 where @xmath52 must obey @xmath86<2 $ ] .",
    "the integrand has double poles at @xmath87 and single poles at @xmath88 . by the deformation of the integration contour to the left or the right , one obtains the series expansion in @xmath39 or @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "due to the doubleness of poles , the single power of the logarithm appears in expansion in @xmath39 .",
    "the result reads from the residue computation that @xmath89 we notice that @xmath90 is given by the residue at @xmath91 and the pole @xmath91 is the first pole one encounters in the contour deformation to the left . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath63 expansion reads @xmath92 this series is divergent and it is impossible to find the asymptotic behavior of @xmath54 at small enough @xmath39 , or more explicitly , the estimation of @xmath93 .",
    "we like to show that the binomial transform converts the @xmath63 series into the series from which @xmath94 can be approximately computable .",
    "the operation of the binomial transform is straightforward .",
    "we find from ( [ binomial3 ] ) and ( [ mellin0 ] ) that @xmath95 the double poles of @xmath54 at @xmath96 have turned into the single poles and the expansion around @xmath97 becomes an infinite series without log .",
    "the poles at @xmath98 have disappeared due to the appearance of @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the series expansion in @xmath25 becomes a polynomial to the order @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath100 where the function @xmath101 represents the contribution from the deformed upward contour crossing at the positive real axis at some point located to the right of the largest pole @xmath102 .",
    "in realistic physical application , one does not have complete information and suffices truncated series to the order @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we neglect the residual contribution @xmath103 and keep only the polynomial denoted @xmath30 , @xmath104    for large @xmath25 , gathering all residues of the poles @xmath87 , we obtain @xmath105 this is the expansion around @xmath97 and manifests @xmath67 be an entire function in the complex @xmath68-plane .",
    "the function @xmath67 is single valued with no cut .",
    "it is a crucial point here that all the coefficients except leading term tend to zero when @xmath46 .",
    "that is , @xmath67 tends to a uniform function , @xmath106    in the contour deformation , the pole we first encounter is @xmath91 and the residue equals to @xmath1 .",
    "this is the limit @xmath107 .",
    "the agreement of @xmath94 and @xmath107 is not of accidental because the residues at @xmath91 are kept equal with each other by the generalized binomial transform ( by which @xmath108 , which is equal to @xmath1 at @xmath91 , is created in the integrand ) .",
    "the function @xmath67 can be written as @xmath109 .",
    "\\label{ap2}\\ ] ] one can see that the second part agrees with @xmath30 .",
    "the first term has the essential singularity at @xmath110 and this is seen only in the deformation of the contour to the left plane .",
    "the term does not allow expansion in @xmath25 and corresponds to @xmath101 and leads us to understand that @xmath67 expressed in ( [ ap1 ] ) and ( [ ap2 ] ) provides the exact result of generalized binomial transform of @xmath54 ( contribution from the infinitely remote half - circle in the left - half plane disappears ) .",
    "now , the point is whether @xmath30 to a given order @xmath20 is useful to simulate the dominant or leading behavior around @xmath111 of @xmath67 .",
    "this is where the physics problems frequently arise . by the numerical study of @xmath30 we find that the transformed series shows the improved behavior compared to the original truncated series of @xmath54 .",
    "but the improvement is not sufficient and the estimation of @xmath112 is not so good even at higher orders .",
    "the failure consists in the point that the effective region of @xmath67 shrinks and enough scaling behavior does not emerge due to the residual influence of corrections in @xmath113 . to suppress the correction , @xmath70th order linear differential equation is effective to subtract the corrections , @xmath114\\bar f(t)=\\bar f(\\infty)+o(t^{-(l+1 ) } ) .",
    "\\label{lde}\\ ] ] here , @xmath115 denotes the exponent of @xmath67 expanded at large @xmath25 and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "we notice that the explicit expansion of @xmath67 at large @xmath25 is not needed here .",
    "used knowledge is just that the expansion is in the positive integer powers of @xmath68 .",
    "the left hand side of ( [ lde ] ) has small correction to @xmath118 at large @xmath25 of order @xmath119 .",
    "also at small @xmath25 , the correction is expected to be reduced , since at large enough @xmath20 the coefficient of @xmath120 vanishes as @xmath121 ( see ( [ reduction ] ) ) .",
    "this suggests that @xmath122 to small @xmath25 region when @xmath20 is large .",
    "we therefore replace @xmath67 in ( [ lde ] ) by @xmath30 which is effective for small @xmath25 supposed that at some order or above @xmath30 may be a good simulation of @xmath67 .",
    "let us then denote @xmath123\\bar f_{n}(t).\\ ] ] by the input of exact values of @xmath115 , we can indeed obtain better behaviors : see fig . 2 where @xmath124 for @xmath125 are plotted at @xmath126 .",
    "there appeared a plateau which grows flatter as the parameter numbers are increased .",
    "however , as the order @xmath20 increases the plateau becomes narrower and the center moves to the origin , which is the influence of the divergent nature of @xmath63 expansion .",
    "the plateau represents , due to the successful elimination of corrections , the leading term in the @xmath127 , @xmath118 .",
    "it is natural to estimate @xmath107 on the unique top on the plateau and this protocol is called the principle of minimum sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite .",

    "this means that the approximate region is indeed extrapolated to larger @xmath383 and , consequently , the convergence becomes quite conceivable due to the disappearance of the binomial coefficient of @xmath412 @xmath413 , @xmath414 in the @xmath46 limit .",
    "the reduction of the correction lead by the left - hand - side of ( [ reduction ] ) gives further accurate estimates as the order of reduction @xmath70 is increased . by using exact values of @xmath370 to more many orders , we obtain @xmath415 at @xmath349 .",
    "the results are respectively exact to @xmath416 , @xmath417 and @xmath350 orders .",
    "the last result achieved the accuracy with the almost same order with the one in linear delta expansion .",
    "the case @xmath418 gives less accurate result at @xmath349 than the case @xmath419 .",
    "but we confirmed that at @xmath57 the accuracy exceeded than the case @xmath419 : @xmath420 and @xmath421 .",
    "the effect of the incorporated exponents shows up at relatively larger orders .",
    "we have explored the generalized binomial transform in the application to a laplace integral and the quantum anharmonic oscillator in the perturbative framework .    in the laplace integral",
    "function , the use of the technique to subtract corrections in assumed power series have found to give accurate estimation of the function in the limit @xmath422 from @xmath63 divergent expansion .",
    "the extrapolation to the infinite order by a simple fitting predicts slightly different value , which is caused by the nature of divergent series . to go beyond the zero - convergence - radius difficulty , we found that diagonal pad approximants of transformed series provided excellent estimation at finite order and solid evidence of convergence to the exact limit .    in the case of the anharmonic oscillator ,",
    "the ground state energy computation is successful in the naive transformed function by detecting the optimal stationary or almost stationary points among many candidates under pms .",
    "the accuracy of estimate is periodically improving as the order grows to @xmath57 and the sequence of estimate is found by the comparison with that in the linear delta expansion to converge to the exact value .",
    "also the coefficients in the strong coupling expansion could be estimated with the same level of accuracy .    from the point of view",
    "that the ground state energy is considered as a function of the coupling constant , we also studied the binomial transform approach to the computation of @xmath259 .",
    "explicit reduction provided @xmath370 is not known was carried out in the case of one - parameter ( @xmath393 ) reduction , and a good estimation was shown to be possible .    in these three estimation tasks",
    ", we found that when the transformed function has power like correction in the target region of the argument , nature of divergent series usually forbids the exact convergence of the sequence of estimates from transformed polynomial , though the improvement by the reduction of the correction to the limit produces accurate results .",
    "the problem has been resolved by the pad approximant method by which the successful extrapolation beyond original narrow effective region was achieved .",
    "note that , in the study of the anharmonic oscillator based on the binomial transform with respect to @xmath5 , reduction of the first order correction was crucial for the estimation by the pad approximants .    in various physical models , the combined use of the correction - reduction and pad approximants may become useful tools for dealing with the divergent series of a given function , usually accessible in the perturbative side , for the quantitative computation of the function in the opposite target region , in particular when the knowledge in the target region is less informed .",
