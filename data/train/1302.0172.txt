    "in a scenario where inflation is preceded by a radiation era , the inflaton field can initially be in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field before decoupling and thus can retain its thermal distribution at the onset of inflation @xcite . due to this initial thermal distribution of inflaton field the power spectrum of the primordial perturbations is modified by an extra temperature dependent factor ( @xmath0 ) which enhances the power of the @xmath1 angular power spectrum of cmbr at largest scales .",
    "this angular power spectrum of cmbr is in accordance with the observations of wmap if the comoving temperature @xmath2 of the primordial perturbations is less than @xmath3 mpc@xmath4 and thus can not discriminate this scenario with a generic super - cool inflationary scenario at the level of power spectrum .    on the other hand , primordial non - gaussianity ( ng )",
    "@xcite , which is a measure of departure from a gaussian distribution of primordial fluctuations generated during inflation , has become very crucial for both theoretical and observational cosmology as measuring or simply constraining ng can discriminate between several degenerate inflationary models which produce the same scale - invariant power spectrum and thus can quantify the dynamics of very early universe .",
    "the non - gaussian parameter @xmath5 arising from three - point correlation function , known as bispectrum , is constrained by wmap 5yr data @xcite as @xmath6 whereas planck @xcite can probe up to @xmath7 .",
    "another non - gaussian parameter @xmath8 arising from four - point correlation function , known as trispectrum , is loosely constrained by wmap @xcite as @xmath9 whereas planck @xcite can probe @xmath10 up to 560 . but measurement of primordial non - gaussianities imprinted in 21 cm background radiation in future experiments can constrain the bispectrum @xcite as @xmath11 and the trispectrum @xcite as @xmath12 .",
    "we will discuss here the non - gaussian features of such a scenario @xcite where inflation is preceded by a radiation era and will show that at the level of trispectrum this scenario differs from a super - cool inflation scenario which can be considered as a signature of pre - inflationary radiation era .",
    "in a generic inflationary scenario a non - gaussian feature arises due to non - linear evolution of comoving curvature perturbation @xmath13 as @xmath14 though the inflaton fluctuations @xmath15 are gaussian in nature .",
    "this kind of non - linear evolution of comoving curvature perturbations yields a non - vanishing three - point correlation function or the bispectrum which can be quantified as @xmath16 where the non - linear parameter in a generic inflationary scenario turns out to be of the order of slow - roll parameters ( @xmath17 ) @xcite and thus too small ( @xmath18 ) to be detected by any present or forthcoming experiments . @xmath19 in the above equation represents the two - point correlation function , called the power spectrum , and the delta function ensures that the three momentum form a triangle due to which @xmath5 is quantified in several triangle configurations namely ( i ) _ squeezed configuration _ @xmath20 and ( iii ) _ folded configuration _ @xmath21 .",
    "if inflation is preceded by a radiation era then    * the inflaton field will have an initial thermal distribution * the thermal vacuum @xmath22 will have finite occupation @xmath23 * the probability of the system to be found in an energy state @xmath24 would be @xmath25 .    due to these above mentioned points the correlation functions ( two - point , three - point and four - point ) now have to be thermally averaged .",
    "the thermally averaged two - point correlation function yields the extra @xmath0 factor @xcite in the power spectrum as has been mentioned before .",
    "thermal averaging of the three - point correlation function enhances the bispectrum ng @xcite .",
    "the enhanced @xmath5 has been computed in different triangle configuration and it is most enhanced in the equilateral configuration where it is enhanced by a factor of 91 with respected to that of in generic inflationary scenarios .",
    "thus it would be in the range of observation of future experiments of 21 cm background radiation @xcite .",
    "the trispectrum is known as the connected part of the four - point correlation function of primordial perturbation and can be written as @xmath26 in a generic inflationary scenario the non - gaussianity arising from trispectrum , quantified by the parameter @xmath10 , turns out to be @xmath27",
    "@xcite i.e. @xmath28 . thus a generic scenario of inflation yields a trispectrum non - gaussianity which is much smaller than a bispectrum non - gaussianity .    in a presence of pre - inflationary radiation era one has to thermal average over the four - point correlation function as has been discussed before .",
    "it turns out that after thermal averaging the four - point correlation function is not equal to the square of thermal average of two - point correlation function .",
    "thus a non - vanishing four - point correlation function exists even without non - linear terms in the comoving curvature perturbations .",
    "this shows that the @xmath29 will not depend upon the slow - roll parameters and can be as large as 42 @xcite and which is withing the detection range of future 21 cm background radiation experiments @xcite .",
    "presence of pre - inflationary radiation era yields an initial thermal distribution of the inflaton fluctuations . if the initial temperature of these fluctuations is less than @xmath3 mpc@xmath4 then the power spectrum is in accordance with the observation and does remain indistinguishable from the generic case at the level of power spectrum . on the other hand , such a pre - inflationary radiation era enhances primordial non - gaussianity in both bispectrum and trispectrum level and these non - gaussianities are within the observable range of the future experiments of primordial non - gaussianities imprinted in the 21 cm background radiation .",
    "interestingly we found out the trispectrum in this case does not depend upon slow - roll parameters due to thermal averaging and is orders of magnitude larger than the bispectrum non - gaussianity .",
    "thus this very feature of primordial non - gaussianities can be considered as a signature of pre - inflationary radiation era .",
