    "eruptive mass loss exhibited by luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) is thought to be important for the evolution of massive stars @xcite , but the exact role lbvs play and the physics of their instability has been challenging to understand . the class of lbvs defined in the milky way and magellanic clouds ( lmc / smc ) is thought to be responsible for some extragalactic non - supernova ( sn ) transients @xcite .",
    "the episodic mass loss of lbvs has also been a reference point for interpreting the dense circumstellar material ( csm ) around type  iin supernovae ( sne  iin ) , which is thought to be indicative of extreme pre - sn eruptions @xcite .",
    "the diverse collection of objects known collectively as lbvs was first proposed as a group by @xcite , and the now standard interpretation of these stars and their role in evolution was established through the 1980s and 1990s .",
    "the review by @xcite provides a summary of the traditional view of lbvs , which has a few key tenets :    \\1 .",
    "lbvs are thought to represent a brief transitional phase in the evolution of the most massive stars , between the main sequence o - type stars and the h - deficient wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars . because they have already lost some mass and because their core luminosity has increased ,",
    "the @xmath1 ratio is high .",
    "this proximity to the classical eddington limit , combined with fe opacity , leads to a violent instability in the envelope that somehow triggers runaway geyser - like mass loss .",
    "the heavy mass loss of lbvs , in the single - star view , is essential to remove the h envelope to form wr stars .",
    "\\2 . observed s  doradus - type variations , as exemplified most clearly by ag  car in the milky way and r127 in the lmc @xcite , are temperature variations at constant bolometric luminosity .",
    "the cool ( visibly bright ) state is caused by a pseudo photosphere that develops in an optically thick wind , which occurs at the same temperature regardless of luminosity @xcite . in their quiescent ( hot ) phase ,",
    "all lbvs reside on the diagonal `` s  doradus instability strip '' @xcite on the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram .",
    "the strong mass loss of lbvs halts their redward evolution , preventing them from becoming red supergiants ( rsgs ) .",
    "this explains the observed absence of high - luminosity rsgs above log(@xmath2)=5.8 , due to instability and mass loss in evolved massive single stars .",
    "some lbvs suffer dramatic `` giant eruptions '' where huge amounts of mass can be lost .",
    "although there is a formalism to explain the mechanism of this mass loss with super - eddington continuum - driven winds @xcite , the underlying reason why single stars suddenly exceed the classical eddington limit by factors of 5 - 10 has remained unexplained . nevertheless , this tremendous mass loss is observed and is likely to be important in the evolution of massive stars .",
    "however , several aspects of this traditional view have started to unravel with time .",
    "in particular , the important conjecture that s  dor variations are major mass - loss events caused by optically thick winds appears to be wrong , and steady super - eddington winds might not be the dominant driving mechanism in many giant lbv eruptions ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "morover , the recognition that sne  iin have progenitors consistent with lbvs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) casts doubt on the idea that lbvs are only a brief transitional phase before the start of core he burning .",
    "investigations with quantitative spectroscopy @xcite disproved the conjecture that s  dor brightening events are caused by pseudo - photospheres in optically thick winds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass - loss rates of s  dor maxima are not high enough to make such extreme pseudo - photospheres , and so they are more likely to be caused by envelope inflation or pulsation @xcite . also , bolometric luminosities during s  dor eruptions are not necessarily constant @xcite . similarly , the idea that giant - eruption maxima are caused by pseudo - photospheres in super - eddington winds is challenged by light - echo spectra of @xmath3  carinae @xcite ( although see @xcite ) , by detailed analysis of the ejecta around @xmath3 car that are better matched by an explosive event @xcite , and the fact that many extragalactic giant lbv eruptions are relatively hot at peak luminosity rather than cool @xcite .",
    "last , as discussed by @xcite , their isolation from massive o - type stars suggests that they are much older than expected .",
    "@xcite suggested that they are largely products of binary evolution and not a transitional state in the lives of the most massive single stars .",
    "here we add another wrinkle to the unraveling story of lbvs .",
    "one of the canonical , classical high - luminosity lbvs in the milky way is ag  carinae ; from a direct measurement of its parallax from _ gaia _ this star appears to be much closer  and therefore much less luminous  than previously thought . even though ag  car is a defining s doradus variable , this closer distance moves it well below the s doradus instability strip established for lbvs in the lmc @xcite .",
    "while the distance to lbvs in the lmc is not so uncertain , the distance to galactic lbvs has always been precarious . below we discuss ag  car and the three other galactic lbv - like stars that are included in the first _",
    "gaia _  data release .",
    "the _ gaia _",
    "first data release ( dr1 ) has recently provided trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for the @xmath42 million stars previously observed by _",
    "hipparcos _ and _ tycho-2 _ , with a typical precision in the parallax of @xmath40.25  mas @xcite .",
    "these parallaxes are enabling a number of investigations not previously possible , such as direct measurement of the basic properties of all planets and their stellar hosts @xcite .",
    "these fundamental new measurements also provide an opportunity to reassess the nature of these lbvs .",
    "the data from _ gaia _  dr1 and from the literature that we use in this study are described in section  [ sec : data ] , which in particular includes parallaxes and proper motions for the four milky way lbvs hen  3 - 519 , hd  168607 , hr  car , ag  car .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the principal results of this study , namely , the distances , space motions , and other basic characteristics of these lbvs .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings , especially the distances for ag  car and hen  3 - 519 which we find to be much closer than previously thought .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary of our results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we searched the _ gaia _",

    "a distance may be straightforwardly computed via @xmath6 .",

    "therefore , we have also retrieved the distances computed by @xcite using a more realistic prior distribution based on empirical stellar distributions for the milky way .",
    "these distances , which span the range 1.22.3  kpc ( table  [ tab : data ] ) , are consistent within the uncertaines with those obtained simply via @xmath8 , but with somewhat smaller uncertainties due to the more informative prior used .",
    "thus we prefer the @xcite distances in what follows but note that our primary conclusions do not depend strongly on this choice .    the _ gaia _  dr1 release notes state that the parallaxes may possess uncharacterized systematic uncertainties of up to 0.3  mas , and recommend adding an additional 0.3  mas to the reported measurement uncertainty .",
    "consequently , @xcite provide a version of their catalog that includes this additional 0.3  mas error .",
    "however , @xcite used a set of benchmark eclipsing binary stars @xcite to quantify the systematic error , finding it to be @xmath9  mas in the sense that the _ gaia _  parallaxes are systematically too small ( distances too long ) .",
    "they also found that this offset vanishes for @xmath10  mas ( @xmath11  kpc ) .",
    "this is corroborated by @xcite , who found excellent agreement between the _ gaia _  distances and a large sample of galactic cepheids at @xmath12  kpc .",
    "since the distances of the lbvs in our study sample are all greater than 1  kpc ( table  [ tab : data ] ) , we do not apply any offset to the parallaxes and moreover do not add any further systematic error to the reported measurement uncertainties .",

    "the _ gaia _",
    "distance to hd  168607 from table  1 is 1.16@xmath130.35 kpc .",
    "this is on the low end of previously adopted values that are usually close to 2 kpc , but not too far off .",
    "the 95% upper limit is 1.9 kpc .",
    "this is unlikely to prompt a major revision in the interpretation of this object .",
    "we postpone a detailed discussion until the higher precison that will be available in the next _ gaia _  data release .",
    "hd  168607 appears to have a low transverse velocity of only a few km s@xmath14 indicated by its _",
    "gaia_proper motion .",
    "_ hr car : _ the distance adopted in the literature for hr  car is usually 5@xmath131 kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) , placing it among the low - luminosity group of lbvs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the _ gaia _",
    "distance in table 1 is 2.27@xmath130.97 kpc , which is lower than previously assumed , but the 95% upper limit of 4.6 kpc is arguably consistent with the usual estimate .",
    "given that hr  car is also now known to have a resolved wide companion about 3 mas away @xcite , which may complicate the measured parallax , we do not advocate a major revision of its distance or luminosity at this time .",
    "again , we postpone a detailed discussion pending the higher precison that will be available in the next _ gaia_data release .",
    "this is not true for the next two objects .",
    "interestingly , the _ gaia _  proper motion of hr car is about 6.5@xmath130.16 mas yr@xmath14 ( pa@xmath4297 ) , which at a distance of @xmath02.5 kpc , translates to a transverse velocity of about 72 km s@xmath14 .    _ ag car : _ although ag  car is seen in projection amid the car ob1/ob2 association , located at 2@xmath72.5 kpc , a larger distance has usually been adopted in the literature , making ag  car one of the most luminous stars in the milky way .",
    "the larger distance is based on its radial velocity relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) as compared to the galactic rotation curve , as well as its high line - of - sight extinction , from which @xcite derived a likely distance of 6.4 - 6.9 kpc .",
    "however , the new _ gaia _",

    "this much closer distance has profound implications for our interpretation of ag  car , and consequences for our understanding of lbvs in general , as discussed in the next section . at a distance of @xmath02 kpc , the measured _ gaia",
    "_  proper motion of 5.2@xmath130.26 mas yr@xmath14 ( to the west / northwest ; pa@xmath4292 ) , would suggest a transverse velocity of about 50 km s@xmath14 .",

    "the large 8 kpc distance was proposed by @xcite based on the large line - of - sight extinction inferred from uv data .",
    "@xcite found a slightly lower reddening , but also favored a large distance near 8 kpc based on the lsr velocity implied by nebular emission and interstellar absorption lines in high - resolution spectra .",
    "again , this would make hen  3 - 519 an extremely luminous star . like ag  car , though , parallax once again indicates a much smaller distance .",
    "the _ gaia _",
    "distance is 1.60@xmath130.86 kpc , with a 95% upper limit of 3.6 kpc ( table 1 ) .",
    "this would appear to rule out the larger distance of 8 kpc proposed by @xcite , instead suggesting membership in the closer car ob1/ob2 association , just like its neighbor ag  car . at a distance of @xmath02 kpc , the measured _ gaia _  proper motion of 5.8@xmath132.7 mas yr@xmath14 ( pa@xmath4312 ) , would suggest a relatively large transverse velocity of 56 km s@xmath14 .",
    "this is , again , very similar in magnitude and direction to the motion of ag car , although with larger uncertainty .    since both ag car and hen 3 - 519 appear to have relatively large peculiar motion in the plane of the sky indicated by their _",
    "gaia_proper motions , they might also be expected to have peculiar radial velocities .",
    "their anomalously positive radial velocities , combined with their proper motion direction , would suggest that they both have peculiar streaming motion outward along the carina spiral arm .",
    "this peculiar motion , in turn , may be the reason for the anomalously large distances inferred in the past from their lsr velocities , which are in disagreement with their measured parallax .",
    "unless both ag car and hen  3 - 519 have wide unresolved companions that conspire to produce the appearance of large parallax ( of similar magnitude , and proper motions in a similar direction ) , it is difficult to see how the large distances inferred in previous studies could be correct .",
    "this requires us to revise the luminosities and revisit our basic interpretations of both ag car and hen  3 - 519 , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .    as a further check on the veracity of the _ gaia _  distances for these stars",
    ", we used the sample of o stars in the carina star - forming region from @xcite , which are all expected to be at a similar distance of @xmath02.2  kpc on the basis of multiple lines of evidence , including the nebular expansion of @xmath3  car itself ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "forty - three of the stars in that study are present in the _ gaia _",
    "dr1 , and in figure  [ fig : smith06 ] we present the distribution of their distances using both the simple @xmath8 estimator and the milky way prior based distances from @xcite .",

    "thus , the _ gaia _  distances for the carina o stars via the simple @xmath8 estimator are consistent with expectation ; the distances from the milky way prior based method @xcite are perhaps slightly underestimated . in any event , the lbvs at apparent distances of @xmath02  kpc are likely to be reliable ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    2.2  kpc .",
    "distances are derived from the _ gaia _",
    "dr1 parallaxes according to both a simple @xmath8 calculation ( top ) and a milky way prior based calculation ( bottom ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : hrd ] shows lbvs on the hr diagram , adapted from previous studies as noted in the caption .",
    "the red points show the luminosities for ag  car , hr  car , hd  168607 , and hen  3 - 519 using previously adopted distances in the literature , whereas the blue points show how the luminosities are lowered based on the nearer _ gaia _  distances . for hen  3 - 519 ,",
    "widely different luminosities are given for the same 8 kpc distance by @xcite and @xcite based on different assumed values of @xmath15 .",
    "we adopt an average of the two here , although this difference is small compared to the factor of 16 reduction in luminosity that results from the nearer distance .    as noted above",
    ", the nearer distance for hr  car is not in such severe disagreement with previous values , and for hd  168507 , the distance agrees within the uncertainty with previous estimates .",
    "it is interesting , though , that at the nearer 2.3 kpc distance , the hotter state of hr car is almost coincident on the hr diagram with the progenitor of sn  1987a .",
    "speculative comparisons between sn  1987a s progenitor and lbvs have been discussed before @xcite .",
    "future _ gaia",
    "_  data releases will provide higher precision in the parallax and proper motion , so we postpone a more detailed discussion of hr  car and hd  168607 until then .",
    "for now , we discuss the basic implications of the substantially smaller distances for ag  car and hen  3 - 519 , where the _ gaia _  distances  even with the relatively large uncertainty of dr1are inconsistent with previous estimates , and where the possible implications for our understanding of lbvs are more severe .",
    "the new distance of @xmath02 kpc implied by ag  car s parallax is over 3 times closer than the usually assumed value .",
    "@xcite preferred 6.4 - 6.9 kpc , and most authors have generally adopted a value of 6 kpc . the @xmath03 times closer _ gaia _",
    "distance makes ag  car about 9 times less luminous .",
    "this would have a tremendous impact on our interpretation of this star and possibly lbvs in general . to place ag  car on the hr diagram",
    ", we assume that the temperatures derived from cmfgen models by @xcite are the same , but that the bolometric luminosity scales by the square of the assumed distance .",
    "there are several immediate implications :    \\1 .",
    "if ag car s luminosity is lower by a factor of 9 , it can not be such a massive star .",
    "previously it sat along an evolutionary track for an initial mass of around 90 - 100 @xmath16 , but the lower luminosity corresponds to a single star of only @xmath025 @xmath16 initial mass .",
    "single stars of this mass are not expected to approach the classical eddington limit during their evolution .",
    "this raises profound questions about the source of ag  car s instability and mass loss , and the nature of the lbv instability itself .",
    "\\2 . lowering its luminosity moves ag  car far off the s dor instability strip , which has been seen as the defining locus of lbvs in their hot state @xcite . yet",
    ", ag  car is an s dor variable ; in fact , it is a defining member of the class @xcite .",
    "since ag  car is considered a prototypical example of a classical high - luminosity lbv @xcite , this raises important doubts about our fundamental picture of lbvs , and suggests that the s  dor instability strip is not as clean as previously thought  at least in the milky way .",
    "stars far away from the s  dor instability strip may evidently be prone to lbv - like behavior as well , if the nearer _ gaia _",
    "distance is correct .",
    "the new luminosity is only log(@xmath2)=5.25 , implying an initial mass ( if single ) of only @xmath025 @xmath16 , as noted above .",
    "this is now low enough that ag  car could have gone through a previous rsg phase .",
    "several previous studies have concluded that dust in the shell nebula around ag  car resembles dust seen around massive rsgs @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a previous rsg phase has generally been discounted , since there are no rsgs observed at very high luminosities corresponding to initial masses above 35 - 40 @xmath16 , whereas ag  car was known to far exceed this limit .",
    "the new lower distance and @xmath17 removes this restriction . with strong mass loss during the rsg phase",
    ", even single - star models can produce lbv - like stars in this lower 20 - 25 @xmath16 initial mass range @xcite .",
    "the lower distance also results in a lower mass for the nebula .",
    "ag car s shell nebula was thought to have a huge total mass of 20 - 25 @xmath16 , derived from the measured dust mass of @xmath00.2 - 0.25 @xmath16 @xcite , an assumed gas : dust mass ratio , and a distance of 6 kpc .",
    "since the dust mass depends linearly on the ir luminosity , the 3 times closer distance implies a 9 times lower nebular mass of roughly 2.5 @xmath16 .",
    "the time averaged mass - loss rates needed to produce this nebula are therefore not as extreme as previously thought .",
    "a closer distance for ag  car also has important consequences concerning the recently discussed environments of lbvs .",
    "@xcite pointed out that in general , lbvs seem strangely isolated from other young massive stars , and questioned their traditional role in evolution as very massive single stars in transition from o - type stars to wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "ag car was surprisingly isolated for a star of 90 - 100 @xmath16 initial mass , being at least 30 pc in projection from any other o - type star @xcite .",
    "most of these neighboring o - type stars were thought to be in the foreground at around 2 kpc , while @xcite were unable to identify any host cluster or association at @xmath06 kpc that might trace ag  car s birth environment .",
    "moving ag  car to a distance of 2 kpc in the car ob association means that the projected separations on the sky to neighboring o - type stars are relevant .",
    "the large 30 pc separation would be problematic if ag  car was a 100 @xmath16 star  but it is far less problematic if ag  car has a much lower luminosity ( and thus a lower initial mass and longer lifetime ) than previously thought .",
    "so , with a nearer distance and lower luminosity , how can we understand ag  car s instability and mass loss that have been used to help define the lbv class ? in the traditional picture , the combination of a very high luminosity near the classical eddington limit and rapid rotation bring the star to the so - called `` @xmath18-limit '' during its post - main - sequence evolution ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , ag  car is thought to be a rapid rotator based on evidence for a bipolar wind from spectropolarimetry , line profile shapes , and other diagnostics of rotation @xcite .",
    "however , this picture must be modified if ag  car is really as close as _ gaia _  suggests .",
    "stars of much lower luminosity and an initial mass around @xmath025 @xmath16 might conceivably develop a high @xmath17/@xmath19 ratio if they shed a large amount of mass in a previous rsg phase , so that similar ideas about envelope instability might still apply  _ but it is hard to imagine that a single star could shed all that mass while maintaining rapid rotation_. instead , it seems as though binary interaction must play some role to explain ag  car , if it is less massive than previously thought .",
    "an example track of a mass - gainer on the hr diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd ] ; evolutionary track from @xcite ) would seem to explain the current properties of ag  car quite naturally .",
    "a stellar merger might produce an equally satisfying explanation @xcite .",
    "such a star gains angular momentum from the mass it accretes from a companion or from a merger , rather than shedding all its angular momentum in the rsg wind .",
    "an important outstanding question is whether or not this rapid rotation gained from binary interaction plays some critical role in triggering the envelope instability that leads to s doradus - like variability . @xcite have hypothesized that rotation might be a trigger for the radius inflation of lbvs in their s doradus cycle , if this is brought on by the density inversion below the photosphere that results from the fe - opacity bump .",
    "based on their surprisingly isolated environments ( implying long lifetimes ) , @xcite suggested that most lbvs may be products of mass accretion or mergers in interacting binaries .",
    "this could potentially explain their anomolously high luminosities via rejuvenation , as well as rapid rotation late in life .",
    "if binary interaction is a key ingredient for the lbv instability , this is not necessarily limited to only the most massive and luminous stars .",
    "overall , moving ag  car down on the hr diagram raises intriguing new questions about the blue supergiants ( bsgs ) and b[e ] supergiants corresponding to initial masses of 1540  @xmath16 ( the green oval in fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd ] ) .",
    "this region includes persistently mysterious objects like the progenitor of sn  1987a , among others .",
    "finding bona - fide lbvs like ag  car and hr  car in this same region may focus our attention and generate new ideas about their significance in stellar evolution .",
    "hen  3 - 519 has been studied far less intensively than ag  car .",
    "less is known about it , and it is not a critical defining lbv like ag  car .",
    "the luminosity at 8  kpc that we used in figure  [ fig : hrd ] is an average of two values in the literature that disagree significantly @xcite .",
    "we used an average of these to scale to the nearer distance of @xmath02  kpc indicated by _ gaia _  parallax .",
    "renewed efforts to determine the fundamental physical parameters of this star are encouraged .",
    "the uncertainty in the measured parallax ( @xmath20 in table  [ tab : data ] ) is larger than the other stars , so the precise value of this new distance should be viewed with some degree of caution .",
    "it is admittedly quite surprising that a star of such low luminosity would exhibit a peculiar emission - line spectrum that is so similar to the spectra of much more luminous stars , such as the ofpe / wn9 stars in the lmc @xcite . aside from the lack of any known s  dor - like variability in hen  3 - 519",
    ", many of the other comments above about ag  car may apply here as well  especially regarding the role of a previous rsg phase in forming its shell nebula , and the likely importance of binary evolution in explaning its current location on the hr diagram .",
    "perhaps hen  3 - 519 is not related to the lbvs at all .",
    "its low luminosity might be more consistent with post - rsg evolution of a 1015  @xmath16 star , especially if it has encountered binary interaction .",
    "regarding its lbv - like spectrum , it may be relevant to point out that even some evolved intermediate - mass ( 58  @xmath16 ) stars inside bipolar planetary nebulae have spectra that very closely resemble the unusual spectrum of the supermassive lbv @xmath3  carinae @xcite .",
    "evolved stars of vastly different luminosity and mass may achieve similar temperatures , densities , and composition in their winds .",
    "we report the parallax distances and proper motions of the galactic lbv stars ag  car , hr  car , and hd  168607 , and the lbv candidate hen  3 - 519 , resulting from the _ gaia _",
    "dr1 first data release .",
    "these are the only galactic lbvs included in dr1 .",
    "the distances to all four objects are closer than traditionally assumed in the literature , lowering their intrinsic luminosities .",

    "it is interesting that at this closer distance , hr  car s position on the hr diagram is nearly identical to the progenitor of sn  1987a .",
    "the prototypical , classical lbv star ag  carinae has a _",
    "gaia_parallax indicating a distance of only @xmath02  kpc  three times closer than previously thought , making it 9 times less luminous . the upper limit to its distance is inconsistent with the usually adopted value of 6.46.7  kpc @xcite .",
    "it now lies along a track of a 25  @xmath16 star , rather than a 90100  @xmath16 star .",
    "this has dramatic implications for the interpretation of this star and its nebula .",
    "in particular , ag  car may have gone through a previous rsg phase , and it is likely to be a product of binary interaction .",
    "moreover , since ag  car is regarded as a defining member of the s doradus class and a classical high - luminosity lbv , its lower luminosity and mass have profound consequences for our traditional view of lbvs in general .    \\4 . for hen  3 - 519 , the distance implied by the _ gaia _",
    "parallax is also about 2  kpc , which is @xmath04 times closer than previously thought ( making the star 16 times less luminous ) .",
    "this moves it far away from the traditional locus of lbvs on the hr diagram .",
    "its origin and evolutionary state remain unclear , but its nebula may be the product of previous rsg mass loss or binary interaction .    given that these stars were thought to be among the most luminous stars in the milky way and have shaped our views of lbvs for the last 30 years , it seems likely that _ gaia _  distances for the remaining lbvs may instigate a re - evaluation of our standard view of lbvs .",
    "more precise values of the parallax for a larger number of galactic lbvs will be available soon ; the results reported here may signal upheaval in our understanding of massive star evolution , even if they are regarded as preliminary .",
    "an obvious avenue for further investigation is whether there are similarly low - luminosity stars in the lmc or other nearby galaxies that have lbv - like spectra or variability , but that have evaded detection because they are faint .",
    "on the other hand , this does not undermine the properties of existing lbvs known in the lmc and smc , since their distances are not so uncertain ; the s  dor strip still seems to work for them",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate why there are stars that appear to be classical s  doradus - like lbvs in the milky way that are so far below the traditional s dor instability strip .",
    "perhaps metallicity plays a key role , or perhaps samples in the lmc are incomplete at lower luminosity .",

    "<S> ag  car has been considered a defining example of a classical lbv , but its lower luminosity also moves it off the s  dor instability strip . </S>",
    "<S> the lower luminosities allow ag  car and hen  3 - 519 to have passed through a previous red supergiant phase , they lower the mass estimates for their shell nebulae , and imply that binary evolution is needed to account for their peculiar properties . </S>",
