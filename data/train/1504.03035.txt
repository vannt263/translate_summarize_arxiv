    "in those simulations , the magnetic field wound by differential rotation grows to dynamically important strengths and later drives a strong outflow along the rotation axis , reproducing the typical supernova - explosion energy of @xmath15  erg .",
    "since the magnetic field and rotation in massive stars are likely to have wide range of values as mentioned above , it may be also important to study more \" ordinary  cases .",
    "in these cases amplification mechanisms that are more efficient than the simple winding are imperative to produce the field strength of @xmath16  g outside the proto - neutron star , which may be necessary to impact on the supernova dynamics . for non - rotating case",
    "@xcite numerically studied the standing accretion shock instability , while @xcite investigated the convection . in both cases ,",
    "the amplification is rather modest , and the impacts on dynamics are found to be minor .    if the iron core is initially rotating rapidly , another candidate of an efficient field amplification mechanism in core - collapse supernovae is the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , which basically occurs in differentially rotating systems @xcite .",
    "simulations of the mri for weak seed magnetic fields are computationally demanding , since the wavelength of the fastest growing mode is quite small compared with the size of the iron core , @xmath17  km : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is alfvn velocity , with neglecting buoyancy .",
    "we deal with the general rotation laws , @xmath20 , taking the buoyancy into account later in section  [ sec.mri ] ] .",
    "in fact , most of previous core - collapse simulations assuming sub - magnetar - class magnetic fields have insufficient spatial resolutions to capture the mri @xcite . in order to resolve the fastest growing mode ,",

    "@xcite carried out similar but longer - term simulations up to several hundred milliseconds after bounce , employing the simple light bulb approximation for neutrino transfer .",

    "the factor @xmath101 is automatically controlled between 0.1@xmath104 during the simulations depending on how well the regularity condition is satisfied .    in order to maintain the regularity conditions approximately around the center in the bg runs",

    "the stability condition of the axisymmetric mri for general rotation laws @xmath20 is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the angle between the perturbation wavenumber @xmath107 and the @xmath108-axis , @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "the mri involves two distinct modes , namely , alfvn mode and buoyant mode , where the former appears for @xmath111 , and the latter only emerges for @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "which mode dominates over the other for a fixed @xmath106 depends on the value of @xmath113 @xcite . for @xmath114 ,",
    "the fastest growing mode is the alfvn mode with the wavenumber of @xmath115 and the growth rate of @xmath116 for @xmath117 , the fastest growth occurs with @xmath118 for @xmath119 , i.e. , it is the buoyant mode .",
    "since @xmath113 depends on @xmath106 , the dominant mode differs for different directions . in order to find the dominant mode for a fixed spatial point ,",
    "we vary @xmath106 numerically in the range of @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig.omri ] for model b5e10@xmath9112.5 at the postbounce time of @xmath121 and 12  ms , where the red and blue colors represent buoyant - mode- and alfvn - mode - dominant regions , respectively , and the shades of the colors indicate the growth rate . it is evident that the dominant mode is different from location to location , and the regions dominated by the buoyant - mode have on average larger growth rates than those dominated by the alfvn mode .",
    "the growth of the alfvn - mode , although slower than the buoyant mode , still may have an important effect on the magnetic field amplification in the locations of its dominance .",
    "it is hence important to know how well we numerically resolve the fastest - growing alfvn mode ( fgam ) , whose wave number is given by equation  ( [ eq.kalf ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig.nmri ] shows for all the models the cumulative fraction of the volume that has @xmath122 smaller than a given value . here",
    "@xmath122 is defined at each point to be the ratio of the wavelength of fgam to the grid size and is measure of how well fgam is resolved numerically .",
    "we introduce to characterize the models , a factor @xmath123 , since only the initial strength of the magnetic field and spacial resolution are different among the current set of the models .",
    "in fact , similar distributions is obtained for the models having the same @xmath124 at early epochs when the magnetic field is almost passive ( see figure  [ fig.nmri ] ) . according to @xcite",
    ", @xmath125 is required to capture the linear growth of the alfvn mode . in our weakest - field model series",
    "b5e10 , the volume fractions with @xmath126 are 0.6 , 0.27 , 0.12 , and 0.018 for models @xmath91100 ( @xmath127 ) , @xmath9150 ( @xmath128 ) , @xmath9125 ( @xmath129 ) , and @xmath9112.5 ( @xmath130 ) , respectively .",
    "we hence believe that our highest - resolution models should be able to capture the linear growth of the alfvn mode well .    in order to confirm that both the buoyant and alfvn modes are growing indeed in the regions predicted in figure  [ fig.omri ] , we examine the wavelengths of the growing modes in these regions .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig.bpolz ] show the color maps of the poloidal magnetic field strength at @xmath131  ms in a region around the equator , indicated by the large box in the upper panel of figure  [ fig.omri ] , where two red belts of buoyant - mode dominance are observed is depicted for model b5e10@xmath9112.5 , its feature is very similar among all the models at this point of time . ] .",
    "we found that the patterns of strong - magnetic - field filaments seen in the upper panels of figure  [ fig.bpolz ] have grown in the regions of buoyant - mode dominance : in the case of model b5e10@xmath9112.5 , this region corresponds to the right - side red belt observed in the large box indicated in the upper panel of figure  [ fig.bpol ] , which has been advected leftward during @xmath132@xmath133  ms .",
    "we compare models b5e10@xmath9112.5 and b2e11@xmath9112.5 , which have different initial field strengths .",
    "as expected for the buoyant mode , the wavelengths of the growing modes , which are evaluated from the sizes of the patterns , are nearly identical between the two models .",
    "the wavelengths of the growing modes observed here may reflect the scale of the dominant perturbation , which may come from numerical noises . to see if this is true , we performed test simulations for the two models in which a perturbation of @xmath134 is given at the beginning of the mri runs , where the amplitude and the wavelength of the perturbation is set as 1% and 500  m , respectively . as a result , we found that the wavelengths of growing modes are shorter than those of the models without perturbation ( see panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig.bpolz ] ) , which indicates that the observed modes depend on the dominant scale of perturbations .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig.bpolz ] zoom in the area around @xmath135 in the vicinity of the inner boundary , where a pocket of buoyant - mode - dominant regions are surrounded by an alfvn - mode - dominant region ( see the small box in the upper panel of figure  [ fig.omri ] ) .",
    "the wavelength of the growing mode there is shorter for the weaker initial field .",
    "in fact , the widths of protruding magnetic flux loops in the panel ( e ) of figure  [ fig.bpolz ] for model b5e10@xmath9112.5 are about three times smaller than those in the panel ( f ) for model b2e11@xmath9112.5 .",
    "the ratio is close to four , the value expected for the alfvn mode . with these facts , we believe that our simulations capture both the buoyant and alfvn modes correctly .",
    "figure  [ fig.t - emag ] plots the time evolutions of the magnetic energies , integrated over the whole numerical domain for all models .",
    "those for the mri runs are plotted until the shock surface reaches the outer boundary . only in model b2e11@xmath9112.5 ,",
    "the plots are continued for another 12  ms after the shock surface passes the outer boundary .",
    "since the magnetic energies flowing out of the boundary during this 12  ms are found to be negligible , i.e. , 0.81% and 0.24% of the total poloidal and toroidal magnetic energies at the end of the plot , respectively , we do not take them into account in the following discussion .",
    "the exponential growth of the energy of the poloidal component , @xmath136 , is apparent during the first @xmath2  ms for all the mri runs . in each model series",
    ", the growth timescale becomes shorter ( or the growth rate is larger ) for higher resolutions until it converges to @xmath13733.5  ms .",
    "these timescales well match the theoretical prediction for the buoyant - mode of @xmath1382000  rad  s@xmath11 , which is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig.omri ] .",
    "this implies that the exponential growth is dominated by the buoyant mode .",
    "indeed , the comparison between the lower panel of figure  [ fig.omri ] and the upper panel of figure  [ fig.bpol ] indicates the coincidence of the locations , where the poloidal magnetic field is preferentially amplified , with those of buoyant - mode dominance at @xmath139  ms , around the end of the exponential growth . from the numerical convergence we observed , it is suggested that the high spatial resolution is required even for the buoyant mode , in which all wavelengths grow at an equal rate .    after the exponential growth phase ceases , @xmath136 continues to increase gradually until it reaches saturation roughly around @xmath140210 , 270 , and 160  ms for model series b5e10 , b1e11 , and b2e11 , respectively ( see figure  [ fig.t - emag ] ) . during this phase",
    "the region of strong magnetic field , say , @xmath141  g , spreads over a considerable volume inside the radius of @xmath142  km ( see the lower panel of figure  [ fig.bpol ] for b5e10@xmath9112.5 ) .    as can be seen from each panel of figure  [ fig.t - emag ]",
    ", the saturated values of @xmath136 do not converge , which may be because the turbulence is not yet fully captured due to numerical diffusivity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since model series b1e11 and b2e11 show a trend of convergence , we may be able to estimate the converged values by fitting the time - averaged @xmath136 for the different resolution models with suitable functions . taking the time averages over @xmath143330",
    "ms and 165185  ms for model series b1e11 and b2e11 , respectively , we fitted the results with functions in the form of @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 are the parameters to be determined .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath145 are @xmath148 and @xmath149  erg for model series b1e11 and b2e11 , respectively ( see figure  [ fig.bsat ] ) .",
    "it is also found that the saturated values of @xmath136 for the highest - resolution models b1e11@xmath9112.5 and b2e11@xmath9112.5 are 91% and 96% of these values , respectively , i.e. , they are close to convergence . indeed , it is expected that if we were able to afford twice higher resolution , we could achieve convergence .",
    "our results also suggest that larger initial magnetic fields may result in larger saturated values .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained by @xcite , who performed local box simulations of mri in the context of accretion disks .",
    "@xcite also claimed that the saturation depends on the initial fields , however , no resolution study was done .",
    "as shown here , the resolution dependence should properly taken into account in discussing the saturation .    the magnetic energy of the toroidal component",
    ", @xmath150 , also shows the exponential growth in each model ( see figure  [ fig.t - emag ] ) .",
    "since the non - axisymmetric mri for the toroidal components can not be treated with the current simulations , this is not due to the mri but due to the winding of the mri - amplified poloidal component by differential rotation .",
    "this is understood from the fact that @xmath150 continuously increases even after the poloidal component is saturated and become one order of magnitude greater than @xmath136 . at the end of the simulations , @xmath150 still continues to increase gradually in most of the models . only for models b1e11@xmath9125 and b1e11@xmath9112.5 , @xmath150 has nearly reached the saturated values .",
    "incidentally , the numerical convergence is achieved in @xmath150 for model series b1e11 and b2e11 .        with our choice of @xmath151",
    "erg  s@xmath11 , the bg run with no magnetic field and rotation fails to explode , the shock wave being stalled at @xmath152  km ( see black line in figure  [ fig.t-rsh.bg ] ) .",
    "although the shock surface is deformed by sasi - like oscillations during the early postbounce phase , which is imprinted in the zigzag evolution of the shock radius in figure  [ fig.t-rsh.bg ] at @xmath153  ms , it becomes almost spherically symmetric later on .",
    "initial rotation of @xmath154  % substantially changes the behavior of the shock evolution .",
    "in fact , fluids at middle to low latitudes tend to expand toward a larger radius thanks to centrifugal forces .",
    "the maximum shock radius gradually increases and exceeds 200  km by @xmath155  ms ( see the cyan line in figure  [ fig.t-rsh.bg ] ) , at which time some parts of fluid elements are still going outward albeit slowly .",
    "these features are consistent with the former findings @xcite , that the rotation helps the explosion ( see , however , @xcite ) .    in the bg",
    "runs with both magnetic field and rotation , the shock surface propagates outward more easily compared with the rotation - only model , with faster propagation speeds for stronger initial magnetic fields ( figure  [ fig.t-rsh.bg ] ) .",
    "the panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) of figure  [ fig.betamulti ] show that the regions of low plasma beta ( @xmath156 , the ratio of matter pressure to magnetic pressure ) appear around the mid - latitude , indicating that the magnetic pressure plays an important role to push the shock outward .",
    "the dynamics change even more drastically when the spatial resolution is increased ( mri runs ) .",
    "figure  [ fig.betamulti ] displays the distributions of the plasma beta for all the 15 models at @xmath157 , 402 , and 172  ms for model series b5e10 ( left column ) , b1e11 ( middle column ) , and b2e11 ( right column ) , respectively . in model series",
    "b2e11 , all the mri runs result in the formation of a collimated low-@xmath156 jet emerging from inside the roughly - spherical shock , whereas the bg run yields an almost spherical expansion of the shock wave .",
    "note that the low-@xmath156 region seen in panel ( l ) for model b2e11@xmath9125 at 172  ms evolves into a collimated jet later on as shown in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig.beta2 ] .",
    "meanwhile , in a weaker - field model series b1e11 , the situation is not as simple as in model series b2e11 . as the resolution gets higher from model b1e11bg to b1e11@xmath91100 , the shape of shock surface changes from spherical to prolate , but it returns to spherical shape when the resolution is doubled again ( see panels ( b ) , ( e ) , ( h ) of figure  [ fig.betamulti ] ) . another doubling of the resolution , in turn , brings about the formation of a collimated low-@xmath156 jet emerging from inside the spherical shock ( model b1e11@xmath9125 , panel ( k ) ) . in the highest resolution model b1e11@xmath9112.5 , a low-@xmath156 region",
    "is observed around the radius of 200  km in the vicinity of the pole ( panel ( n ) of figure  [ fig.betamulti ] ) , which may hint at a later jet formation .",
    "although the head of low-@xmath156 region is still lingering around the radius of 300  km at the end of the simulation ( @xmath140440  ms , see panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig.beta2 ] ) , we expect that it would propagate further and eventually forms a collimated jet as found in model b1e11@xmath9125 ( see below ) .",
    "finally in the weakest - field model series b5e10 , the shock surfaces are roughly spherical for all the resolutions except model b5e10@xmath91100 , which has a prolate shock , and no model shows a jet formation until the end of the simulation .",
    "we first discuss the factors responsible for the different shock morphorogies for different resolutions by comparing models b1e11@xmath91100 and b1e11@xmath9125 at @xmath158  ms , several milliseconds prior to the launch of the collimated - jet in model b1e11@xmath9125 .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig.rambeta ] depict the distribution of the ram pressure for the two models .",
    "it is observed in both the models that a vicinity of the pole is dominated by intense downflow ( blue region ) , outside of which modest outflow driven by relatively - low plasma beta is seen ( red region ; see also lower panels ) .",
    "the width of the downflow channel is found to be narrower for the lower resolution model b1e11@xmath91100 , which would be due to less effective mri : the better the mri resolved , the more efficiently angular momentum is transferred outwards from the rotation axis , with which the rotational support decreases further around the pole and a broader downflow channel forms .",
    "accordingly , the lower-@xmath98 edge of the outflow gets closer to the pole in this model , viz .",
    "the matter is ejected more preferentially along the pole .",
    "it is likely that this causes the prolate shock surface found in a model b1e11@xmath91100 .",
    "note that although relatively - low plasma beta , @xmath159 , is seen around the bottom of the downflow channel in both the models , it seems not enough to drive the matter outward against the downflow ( see the lower panels of figure  [ fig.rambeta ] ) .",
    "the magnetically - driven mass ejection is only possible for the region outside the channel with such relatively - low plasma beta .",
    "it is found from figure  [ fig.betamulti ] that the trend of broader downflow channel and thus a larger deflection of the outflow direction from the pole for higher resolution models is valid for a wide range of resolution in model - series b5e10 and b1e11 as long as a jet is absent .",
    "this suggest that our interpretation for the shock morphology is reasonable .",
    "note that the trend discussed here becomes no longer valid once a jet appears , since it changes the flow structure .",
    "according to the above discussion , the collimated - jets seen in some models must have been launched against the downflow . in the case of model b1e11@xmath9125 ,",
    "the low-@xmath156 clump around @xmath160  km in the vicinity of the pole observed in panel ( d ) of figure  [ fig.rambeta ] is a prototype of the low-@xmath156 jet seen at a later phase ( panel ( k ) of figure  [ fig.betamulti ] ) .",
    "we found indeed that this low-@xmath156 clump suffers from successive depression by the downflow until it finally forms the collimated jet .",
    "to see the process of jet formation more in detail , we define the `` low-@xmath156 head '' by the maximum radius of the region where the ratio of the matter pressure to magnetic pressure , each of which is angularly averaged over @xmath161 .",
    "] , is less than 0.5 , and plot the evolutions of them for model series b1e11 and b2e11 ( see the upper panels of figure  [ fig.t - jet ] ) . for model",
    "b1e11@xmath9125 the sequence of the depression described above is clearly seen as an oscillatory evolution of the low-@xmath156 head until @xmath162  ms , from which it grows monotonically .",
    "model b1e11@xmath9112.5 shows a slower growth of the low-@xmath156 head and more distinct feature of oscillation , indicating that the depression by downflow is more significant .",
    "a similar oscillation is also found for model b1e11@xmath91100 , but the low-@xmath156 head almost stagnates at a small radius in this case . on the contrary to the weaker field case",
    ", model series b2e11 shows no oscillation of the low-@xmath156 head , which grows almost monotonically in all of the three models plotted in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig.t - jet ] heads evolve more or less similarly among all the mri runs of model series b2e11 .",
    "although , in the right column of figure  [ fig.betamulti ] , all the mri runs except for b2e11@xmath9125 show a trend that the jet - head radius is larger for a higher resolution at 172  ms , with which one may think that model b2e11@xmath9125 is an outlier , figure  [ fig.t - jet ] represents that there is in fact no such a trend on the whole time . ] .    from the above discussion , the downflow seems the key to the propagation of low-@xmath156 head and the eventual formation of a collimated jet .",
    "then the condition for the jet formation may be obtained by comparing the kinetic energy of the downflow and the magnetic energy responsible for the jet driving .",
    "as argued below , we indeed found that this comparison reasonably explains the jet formation .    in the lower panels of figure  [ fig.t - jet ]",
    "we plot the time evolutions of the above two energies for model series b1e11 and b2e11 , defining the former as @xmath163 and the latter as @xmath164 , where the integrants are nonzero only for @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively , and the integration ranges are confined to 50  km@xmath167 and @xmath168 . in model series",
    "b2e11 , the evolutions of @xmath169 appears rather similar among the different resolutions . in each model , @xmath169 exceeds @xmath170 around @xmath171  ms , which is found to approximately coincide with the start of the low-@xmath156 head propagation ( see right column of figure  [ fig.t - jet ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath170-@xmath169 comparison is indeed a rough indicator for the jet formation .    unlike in model",
    "series b2e11 , the values of @xmath169 in model series b1e11 rather diverge among different resolutions during a late phase after their growth nearly saturates around @xmath172  ms .",
    "interestingly , while reducing the grid size , @xmath84 , from 50  m to 25  m result in averagely - larger @xmath169 during the late phase , which may be simply due to smaller numerical diffusivity , another doubling of resolution decreases that value ( see panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig.t - jet ] ) .",
    "we infer that the decrease of @xmath169 observed here is caused by the interaction of low-@xmath156 matter with downflow .",
    "since the downflow matter involves high-@xmath156 ( see figure  [ fig.rambeta ] ) , the plasma beta of low-@xmath156 matter increases as it hit by and mixed with the downflow matter , which results in downturn of @xmath169 .",
    "indeed , the panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig.t - jet ] shows that the downflow energy , @xmath170 , is averagely larger in model b1e11@xmath9125 than in b1e11@xmath9112.5 , which is due to more effective mri as discussed before , and the effect of downflow is expected to be more standout for the latter model .",
    "although the effect of the downflow basically becomes more potent by increasing the resolution , whether it is essential for the change of @xmath169 would depend on the competition with other factors . for the increase of @xmath169 from model b1e11@xmath9150 to b1e11@xmath9125 ,",
    "it is likely that the reduction of the numerical diffusivity is more important than the increment of the downflow effect .",
    "meanwhile , the fact that the @xmath169 is roughly unchanged by increasing the resolution in model series b2e11 indicates that the downflow effect is insignificant in these models .",
    "one reason for this would be that the plasma beta of low-@xmath156 matter is low enough to maintain @xmath173 , the criterion for adding up @xmath169 , even after the mixing with downflow matter .",
    "we compare in figure  [ fig.beta-emag ] the @xmath156-distribution of magnetic energy contained within @xmath168 for models b1e11@xmath9112.5 and b2e11@xmath9112.5 at the moment when @xmath170 first reaches @xmath174  erg in each model , and found that the latter model indeed involves more low-@xmath156 matter .",
    "another reason that we consider important is that models b2e11 take shorter time to reach the saturation of magnetic energy than models b1e11 do ( see figure  [ fig.t - emag ] and lower panels of figure  [ fig.t - jet ] ) . since @xmath170 gradually increases until attenuated by the jet formation , an early growth of magnetic energy is advantageous to alleviate the downflow effect .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath170 at the moment when it is caught up with by @xmath169 , is generally smaller in model series b2e11 ( @xmath175  erg ) than in b1e11 ( @xmath176  erg ) .",
    "bearing in mind the variations of @xmath169 and @xmath170 among the different resolutions mentioned for model series b1e11 in the above , the non - monotonic dependence of jet formation on the resolution found in these models ( the middle column of figure  [ fig.betamulti ] ) is also explained reasonably in terms of the @xmath170-@xmath169 comparison . for model b1e11@xmath9150 ,",
    "the fact that @xmath169 is almost always smaller than @xmath170 is consistent with the stagnation of the low-@xmath156 head at small radii .",
    "similar to model series b2e11 , model b1e11@xmath9125 shows the outward propagation of the low-@xmath156 head after @xmath169 becomes comparable to @xmath170 around @xmath177  ms .",
    "contrary to the former cases , however , @xmath169 does not exceed @xmath170 so much and sometimes even falls behind that , as expected from the oscillatory evolution of the low-@xmath156 head . in the higher resolution model b1e11@xmath9112.5 , the low-@xmath156 head starts to propagate after @xmath169 grows comparable to @xmath170 around @xmath178  ms , but shows remarkable oscillations as @xmath169 occasionally becomes smaller than @xmath170 by up to factor @xmath179 , due to the downflow effect .",
    "about 140  ms later , however , low-@xmath156 filaments outside the downflow choke the channel region ( see panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig.beta2 ] ) , decreasing @xmath170 drastically and resulting in the acceleration of the low-@xmath156 head . as mentioned before the position of the low-@xmath156 head is still at @xmath180  km and no clear jet formation is observed by the end of the simulation .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath169 exceeds @xmath170 by almost factor 10 at that time , and the latter does not increase significantly afterward , we expect that a collimated jet will form later also in model b1e11@xmath9112.5 .",
    "it should be noted that since doubling the resolution from model b1e11@xmath9125 to b1e11@xmath9112.5 renders the downflow effect more significant , which is disadvantageous for a jet formation , higher resolution runs are necessary to understand how the dynamics converge in terms of resolution for model series b1e11 .",
    "since the jet formations discussed above take place close to the pole , where the coordinates become singular , one may be worried that the observed features are merely numerical artifacts .",
    "although some level of numerical noises originating from the coordinate singularity may be inevitable in spite of the special treatment described in section  [ sec.method ] , we believe that they are of physical origin .",
    "this is because the jet is born at some distance from the pole , @xmath179  km ( panel ( d ) of figure  [ fig.rambeta ] ) , which is much larger than the width of the region of the special treatment , and because the evolution of the low-@xmath156 region is reasonably understood by the above arguments .",
    "although the variation of dynamical behavior with the resolution seems rather complicated as described above , there is actually one clear trend , i.e. , the faster shock expansion at the equator for the higher - resolutions ( see figure  [ fig.betamulti ] and [ fig.t - req ] ) . since the equatorial region contains a larger amount of mass compared to the polar region , the larger explosion energy is expected for the faster shock expansion . as shown",
    "shortly , this is indeed the case .",
    "figure  [ fig.t - eexp ] shows the time evolution of the diagnostic explosion energy , which is defined as the sum of the kinetic , magnetic , internal , and gravitational energies over the fluid elements that move outward with positive energies , for model series b1e11 .",
    "this clearly shows that the diagnostic explosion energy becomes larger as the resolution is increased .",
    "figure  [ fig.betamulti ] indicates that the magnetic effects are not necessarily lager for higher resolutions ( e.g. , compare panel ( e ) and ( h ) ) , which suggests that the magnetic pressure is not a key factor to boost the explosion . note",
    "that although the collimated jets are driven by magnetic pressure , they give a minor contribution to the explosion energy due to their small volumes .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the increase in the explosion energy is attributes to the more efficient neutrino heating in higher resolution models .",
    "how close to revival the stalled shock is roughly measured by the ratio of the advection timescale , @xmath181 , during which matter traverses the gain region , to the heating timescale , @xmath182 , within which matter gains enough energy to overcome gravity @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we define the advection timescale as @xmath183 where the double angle bracket implies that the solid - angle average over @xmath184 as well as the time average over the interval of 10  ms are taken .",
    "@xmath185 is the mean shock radius , whereas @xmath186 is defined as the innermost radius at which the solid - angle - averaged net heating is positive .",
    "the heating timescale is defined as @xmath187 where the single angle brackets mean that the only solid - angle average is taken .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig.t - heat ] plots the evolution of @xmath188 for model series b1e11 .",
    "the comparison of this figure with figure  [ fig.t - eexp ] indicates that shock revival , which is indicated by positive explosion energies , roughly corresponds to @xmath189 .",
    "it is also evident that higher resolutions result in higher heating efficiency .    in @xcite",
    ", we argued that this is due to the increase of @xmath181 in the higher resolution models as a result of more efficient angular momentum transfer , which leads to the expansion of the heating region .",
    "this is true of the current models .",
    "comparison between models b1e11@xmath91100 and b1e11@xmath9112.5 at @xmath190  ms shows that the heating region is thicker ( see the upper panels of figure  [ fig.heat ] ) and the amount of angular momentum contained in the heating region is larger for the latter model : they are @xmath191 g  @xmath7s@xmath11 for model b1e11@xmath91100 and @xmath192 g  @xmath7s@xmath11 for model b1e11@xmath9112.5 at @xmath190  ms .    besides the increment of @xmath181",
    ", we found in this paper that the reduction of @xmath182 owing to a larger heating rate per unit mass is also contributing to the larger @xmath188 in the higher resolution models .",
    "as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig.t - heat ] , the heating rate per unit mass during @xmath3@xmath193  ms , the period crucial to shock revival , becomes larger as the resolution increases .",
    "the comparison of the upper panels of figure  [ fig.heat ] for models b1e11@xmath91100 and b1e11@xmath9112.5 indicates that this is originated in a patch of region with large heating rates around the equator observed in the latter model .",
    "we evaluated the heating and cooling rates separately and found that the relatively inefficient cooling in the patch compared with the surroundings is responsible for the larger net heating rate . from equation  ( [ eq.qe.em ] ) , the cooling rate per unit mass , @xmath194 , is proportional to @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "we found that there is no substantial difference in @xmath195 between the patch and surroundings but that @xmath196 is several times smaller in the patch . in the surroundings , where @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 , the products are @xmath200 and @xmath201 , viz . , the cooling is dominated by electron capture since electrons are much more abundant than positrons . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron capture is found to be relatively inactive in the patch due to small number of protons ( @xmath202 , see panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig.heat ] ) and electrons ( @xmath203 ) : the product is @xmath204 .",
    "we found that the positron capture rate is small as well in the patch : @xmath205 , where @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "to summarize , the the larger heating rate in the patch is caused by poverty of protons and electrons , and a low electron capture rate as a consequence .",
    "the low-@xmath0 ( equivalently low-@xmath28 ) region coincides with the location where the poloidal magnetic field is relatively strong ( compare panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig.heat ] ) .",
    "this suggests that low-@xmath0 fluids originally located at small radii are drifted along the magnetic flux loops by mri .",
    "we also found that the outflow along the rotation axis observed in model b1e11@xmath91100 and the collimated jets found in models b1e11@xmath9125 and b1e11@xmath9112.5 ( see panels ( e ) , ( k ) , and ( n ) of figure  [ fig.betamulti ] , respectively ) also convey low-@xmath0 matter from deep inside the core , which is reflected to the rise of the volume - averaged net heating rate seen after @xmath208  ms for these models ( see green , magenta , and red lines in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig.t - heat ] ) .    in order to estimate the possible influences of these effects on the global dynamics",
    ", we carried out two groups of additional test simulations based on models b1e11@xmath9150 and b2e11@xmath9150 .",
    "the first one of them are extends the radial outer boundaries to @xmath209  km ( models b1e11h and b2e11h ) .",
    "the other one is different in that the net neutrino heating is switched off , i.e. , @xmath210 $ ] ( models b1e11nh and b2e11nh ) .",

    "comparing the two panels , we can immediately see the importance of the neutrino heating : when the shock surface reaches @xmath209  km in model b2e11h , that in model b2e11nh has just passed the radius of 500  km , and it arrives at @xmath209  km 65  ms later than model b2e11h . even though the collimated jets observed in these two models are magnetically dominated , the neutrino heating plays a significant role .",
    "the diagnostic explosion energies at the time when the shock fronts reach the radius of 1000  km are @xmath212 and @xmath213  erg , respectively , for models b2e11h and b2e11nh , implying that the contribution of the neutrino heating to the explosion energy is about 60% .",
    "the neutrino heating is even more crucial for weaker initial fields .",
    "the shock surface in model b1e11nh stays within 400  km even at 678  ms after bounce while that of b1e11h has passed the radius of 1000  km at @xmath214  ms .",
    "the diagnostic explosion energy in model b1e11h is @xmath215  erg at the time when the shock front reach the radius of 1000  km , while that in model b1e11nh is negligibly small , @xmath216  erg , through the simulation .",
    "note that longer time simulations following the propagation of the shock front through the whole progenitor would be necessary to correctly measure the explosion energy .",
    "the small contribution of magnetic field to the explosion energy discussed above is a substantial difference from previous mhd simulations involving magnetar - class initial fields , in which a magnetic field alone boosts the explosion energy up to @xmath217  erg , accompanying a jet with a rather - large opening angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that in our models , the maxwell stress is weaker , and thus the extraction of the rotational energy is less efficient than in those simulations .",
    "we have seen that the mri efficiently amplifies weak seed magnetic fields to dynamically important strengths , having a positive impacts on explosion . in this section",
    ", we investigate whether the above results depends on the location of the inner boundary , shifting it to smaller radii in model b2e11@xmath9150 .",
    "we ran a new simulation with the inner boundary at @xmath218  km to take the effect of strong differential rotation beneath the radius of 50  km into account , which we refer to as model rin30 .",
    "the spatial resolution of this model is similar to that of model b2e11@xmath9150 outside the radius of 50  km and is 30  m at the inner boundary .",
    "the fraction of the volume where @xmath122 is less than 10 is only a few percent inside the radius of 50  km , which is similar to that outside ( see figure  [ fig.nmri ] ) .",
    "the growth rates of mri inside the radius of 50  km are found to be lager than those outside on average .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig.ibc ] indicates that the exponential growth rate of @xmath219 averaged over the range of @xmath79km@xmath80 is larger for model rin30 than for model b2e11@xmath9150 .",
    "this implies that the magnetic fields amplified inside the radius of 50  km are advected outward in model rin30 .",
    "note that the degree of differential rotation is even greater inside the radius of 30  km , and thus the above effect would be more pronounced if we carried out the simulation with a yet smaller radius of inner boundary . on the other hand , we found that the saturation level of @xmath219 is unaffected by the position of the inner boundary , which may be reasonable if the saturation is determined by the strength of the numerical diffusion , and hence the spatial resolution , which are more or less the same ( see section  [ sec.mri ] ) . the evolution of @xmath220 is similar to that of @xmath219 .",
    "the global dynamics does not change significantly , either , by moving the inner boundary position .",
    "the low-@xmath156 collimated jet that emerges from inside the roughly - spherical shock is a feature common to both models b2e11@xmath9150 and rin30 . whereas the evolutions of the jets are rather different between the two models , the shock propagation on the equator are very similar between the two .",
    "as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig.ibc ] , the diagnostic explosion energies of the two models are also nearly identical . from these results",
    ", we believe that the conclusions of the current study are not affected by our choice of the inner boundary position , @xmath83  km .",
    "we have performed mhd simulations of the core - collapse of rapidly - rotating magnetized stars in two dimensions under axisymmetry , changing both the strength of magnetic field and the spatial resolution .",
    "our goal is to study the behavior of the mri in core - collapse supernovae and its impacts upon the global dynamics . as a result of computations we found the followings .",
    "the mri greatly amplifies the seed magnetic fields even in the dynamical background of the core - collapse . although the dominant mode , buoyant mode or alfvn mode , differs from location to location , the former plays a primary role in the exponential growth phase .",
    "it is true that the linear growth rate of the buoyant mode is independent of the wavelength , a certain degree of high spatial resolution seems necessary to correctly capture the exponential growth .",
    "the magnetic energies of the poloidal component gets nearly saturated within the simulation times in all models , where the saturation level is higher for larger initial magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic energies of the toroidal component grow continuously in most of the models , on the other hand , and the core becomes toroidal - field dominant .",
    "the mri also has a grate impacts on the global dynamics .",
    "models in which the mri are well resolved show faster expansions of shock surface and obtain more powerful explosions .",
    "the formation of collimated jet is also found in models where the initial magnetic field is relatively strong and the mri is well resolved .",
    "the following two effects are found to be the key to the boost of explosion : the first one is the expansion of the heating region due to the outward angular momentum transfer .",
    "this makes the advection timescale , or the time for matter to traverse the heating region , longer and thus enhance the heating ; the second effect is the drift of low-@xmath0 ( equivalently low-@xmath28 ) matter along the mri - distorted magnetic flux loops as well as their ejection by the jets , from deep inside the core to the heating region .",
    "the cooling due to electron capture is reduced in the low-@xmath0 region , and the net heating rises as a result .",
    "the diagnostic explosion energies obtained in the current simulations are much smaller than the typical value of @xmath221  erg in reality .",
    "note , however , that our choice of the neutrino luminosity , @xmath222  erg  s@xmath11 , which is assumed to be constant , is quite modest . according to the core - collapse simulations by @xcite , who employed the flux - limited diffusion with the ray - by - ray - plus approximation for neutrino transport , both @xmath40 and @xmath223 are @xmath224  erg  s@xmath11 at @xmath225  ms and decay to @xmath226  erg  s@xmath11 over several hundred milliseconds . if such an evolution of luminosity is adopted in our simulations more energetic explosion would be obtained .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of progenitors of core - collapse supernovae may posses even weaker magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "since lower saturation magnetic fields are expected for weaker initial magnetic fields according to our results , the impact of mri in \" normal  supernovae will be smaller than that found in this work .",
    "although it is important to study much weaker magnetic fields , simulations will be computationally expensive and thus currently unfeasible : a reduction of the initial magnetic field by half , with the spatial resolution kept at the current level , demands eight times higher computational cost for 2d time - explicit simulations .",
    "the dependence on the initial rotation also needs to be investigated , since the rotation speed of stars is also likely to distribute over a wide range @xcite .",
    "we are currently undertaking such studies , and the results will be presented elsewhere in the future .",
    "although our simulations are 2d under axisymmetry , supernovae occur in three dimensions in reality , and non - axisymmetric effects such as dynamo , three - dimensional turbulence , non - axisymmetric modes of various instabilities may be important .",
    "one should keep in mind that these effects possibly alter results obtained by current 2d simulations . for example , 3d - mhd simulations performed by @xcite demonstrated that magnetically driven - jets can be destroyed by the @xmath228 mode of a kink - type instability , whereas such destruction of the jet was not observed in 3d - mhd simulations by @xcite .",
    "in order to know how essential non - axisymmetric effects are , 3d global simulations are mandatory . during the reviewing process of this paper , @xcite published the results of the first global-3d simulations of the mri in proto - neutron stars . under quadrant symmetry",
    ", they had simulated the evolution of the mri for 10  ms , and found the formation of large - scale , strong toroidal fields , which hints at later magnetically - driven mass ejections .",
    "such simulations have only just begun , and the possible 3d effects mentioned above should be studied in detail in the future .",
    "this requires long - term , large - domain , full 3d simulations , which may be marginally feasible with exa - flops computers of the next generation .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that the neutrino viscosity may hamper the growth of mri deep inside the core , i.e. , @xmath229  km for a fast rotation like ours . applying the magnetic field of @xmath230@xmath231  g obtained in our bg runs for @xmath229  km to the fast rotation model of @xcite",
    ", we found that the neutrino viscosity may be marginally important there .",
    "since the inner boundary condition of our mri runs is given by the data of the bg runs of low resolution , the artificial suppression of mri by numerical diffusions may effectively mimic the damping by the neutrino viscosity .",

    "<S> the strength of the magnetic field and the spatial resolution , the evolution of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) and its impacts upon the dynamics are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the mri greatly amplifies the seed magnetic fields in the regime where not the alfvn mode but the buoyant mode plays a primary role in the exponential growth phase . </S>",
    "<S> the mri indeed has a powerful impact on the supernova dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it makes the shock expansion faster and the explosion more energetic , with some models being accompanied by the collimated - jet formations . </S>",
    "<S> these effects , however , are not made by the magnetic pressure except for the collimated - jet formations . the angular momentum transfer induced by the mri causes the expansion of the heating region , by which the accreting matter gain an additional time to be heated by neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the mri also drifts low-@xmath0 matter from the deep inside of the core to the heating region , which makes the net neutrino heating rate larger by the reduction of the cooling due to the electron capture . </S>",
    "<S> these two effects enhance the efficiency of the neutrino heating , which is found to be the key to boost the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we found that our models explode far more weakly when the net neutrino heating is switched off . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the neutrino heating to the explosion energy could reach 60% even in the case of strongest magnetic field in the current simulations . </S>"
