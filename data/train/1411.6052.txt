    "traversable lorentzian wormholes were first considered by morris and thorne @xcite ; because of the interesting unusual properties of these topologically non trivial geometries , in the years after this leading work they have received considerable attention @xcite . a major objection against their actual existence , however , is the necessity of `` exotic '' matter ( not fulfilling the energy conditions ) supporting the wormholes ; within the framework of general relativity this difficulty can not be avoided in the case of compact wormhole geometries .",
    "therefore , wormholes of the thin - shell class @xcite , that is , those which are mathematically constructed by cutting and pasting two geometries , present a particular interest because in such configurations the exotic matter can be restricted to a layer placed at the throat ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .    in the last three decades , cosmic strings",

    "@xcite : cylindrically symmetric wormholes admit two definitions of the throat , and one of them that the geodesics _ restricted to a plane normal to the symmetry axis _ open up can be compatible with the energy conditions even within the framework of general relativity . it has been shown that such cylindrical wormholes satisfying the weak energy condition can not have a flat or local cosmic string asymptotic behavior at both sides of the throat .",
    "wormholes associated with an azimuthal magnetic field and supported by non exotic matter were found ; they are neither symmetric with respect to the throat nor flat or local string like at infinity ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the possibility of cylindrical thin - shell wormholes supported by a layer of positive energy density placed at the throat was proved in ref .",

    "the mathematical construction of generic thin - shell wormholes with cylindrical symmetry ( see ref .",

    "( [ e8 ] ) it follows that the surface energy density is negative , so the matter at the throat is _",
    "exotic_. however , bronnikov and lemos @xcite recently introduced a new throat definition which only requires that the circular radius function @xmath62 has a minimum at the throat ; thus , we can call this one the _ radial _ flare - out condition .",
