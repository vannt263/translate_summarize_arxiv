    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) play an important role as cosmological distance indicators and are successfully applied to determine cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which have led to the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "however , the exact nature of sne ia progenitors has not been clarified ( see the reviews by @xcite ; @xcite ) . it is generally agreed that sne ia originate from the thermonuclear runaway of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( co wd ) in a binary system . the co wd accretes material from its companion , increases mass to its maximum stable mass , and then explodes as a thermonuclear runaway .",
    "almost half of the wd mass is converted into radioactive nickel-56 in the explosion ( @xcite ) , and the amount of nickel-56 determines the maximum luminosity of sne ia ( @xcite ) .    according to the nature of the companions of the mass accreting white dwarfs , two competing scenarios have been proposed , i.e the double - degenerate channel ( dd , @xcite ; @xcite ) and the single degenerate channel ( sd , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the dd channel , two co wds with a total mass larger than the chandrasekhar mass limit may coalesce , and then explode as a sn ia .",
    "although the dd channel is theoretically less favored , e.g. double wd mergers are more likely to result in accretion - induced collapses rather than sne ia ( @xcite ) , it is premature to exclude the channel at present since there exists evidence that the channel may contribute to a few sne ia ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the single - degenerate chandrasekhar model is an alternative of dd and some surveys showed that many sd systems are good candidates for sne ia ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the maximum stable mass of a co wd is @xmath4 ( close to the chandrasekhar mass , @xcite ) , and the companion is probably a main sequence star or a slightly evolved star ( wd+ms ) , or a red - giant star ( wd+rg ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the sd model is supported by many observations .",
    "for example , variable circumstellar absorption lines were observed in the spectra of sn ia 2006x ( @xcite ) , which indicates the sd nature of its precursor .",
    "@xcite suggested that the progenitor of sn 2006x is a wd + rg system based on the expansion velocity of the circumstellar material , while @xcite argued a wd + ms nature for this sn ia .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that sn 2007on is also possible from a wd + ms channel . in this paper , we only focus on the wd + ms channel , which is a very important channel for producing sne ia in our galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , some wd + ms systems are possible progenitors of sne ia ( see the review of @xcite ) .",
    "for example , supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) were suggested as good candidates for the progenitors of sne ia ( @xcite ) .",
    "some of the ssss are wd + ms systems and some are wd + rg systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported that in every galaxy , there are at least several hundred ssss with a luminosity of @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 based on chandra data from four external galaxies ( an elliptical galaxy , ngc 4967 ; two face - on spiral galaxies , m101 and m83 ; and an interacting galaxy , m51 ) .",
    "they also noticed that the ssss appear to be associated with the spiral arms in the spiral galaxies , which may indicate that ssss are young systems ( wd + ms systems ? ) .",
    "recurrent novae may also be good candidates as the progenitors of sne ia ( @xcite ) and several novae have been suggested to be possible progenitors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . some of the novae are wd + ms systems and some are wd + rg systems .    a direct way to confirm the progenitor model is to search for the companion stars of sne ia in their remnants .",
    "the discovery of the potential companion of tycho s supernova have verified the power of the method and also the reliability of the wd + ms model ( tycho g named in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite stressed further the statement in @xcite by analysing the chemical abundances of tycho g.    many works have concentrated on the wd+ms channel .",
    "some authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have studied the wd+ms channel by a simple analytical method to treat binary interactions .",
    "such analytic prescriptions may not describe some mass - transfer phases , especially those occurring on a thermal time - scale ( @xcite , ) .",
    "@xcite studied this channel from detailed binary evolution calculation , while they considered two wd masses ( 1.0 and 1.2 @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the channel for metallicities @xmath9 and 0.02 , but they only studied the case a evolution ( mass transfer during core hydrogen burning phase ) .",
    "@xcite carried out a detailed study of this channel including case a and early case b ( mass transfer occurs at hertzsprung gap , hg ) for @xmath10 . following the study of @xcite , @xcite studied the wd + ms channel comprehensively and systematically at various z and showed the initial parameter spaces for the progenitors of sne ia and the distributions of the initial parameters for the progenitors of sne ia . here ,",
    "based on the study in @xcite , we want to show the final parameter spaces of companions at the moment of sne ia explosion and check whether the model used in @xcite can explain the properties of some recurrent novae and ssss , which are suggested to be the possible progenitors of sne ia , and the properties of tycho g , which is the potential companion of tycho s supernova .    in section [ sect:2 ]",
    ", we simply describe the numerical code for binary evolution calculations .",
    "the evolutionary results are shown in section [ sect:3 ] . in section [ sect:4 ]",
    ", we briefly discuss our results , and finally we summarize the main results in section [ sect:5 ] .",
    "our method for treating the binary evolution of wd + ms systems is same to that in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we simply redescribe our method .",
    "we use the stellar evolution code of @xcite to calculate the binary evolutions of wd+ms systems .",
    "the code has been updated with the latest input physics over the last three decades ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) is treated within the code described by @xcite .",
    "we set the ratio of mixing length to local pressure scale height , @xmath11 , to 2.0 , and set the convective overshooting parameter , @xmath12 , to 0.12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which roughly corresponds to an overshooting length of @xmath13 .",
    "ten metallicities are adopted here ( i.e. @xmath140.0001 , 0.0003 , 0.001 , 0.004 , 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.05 and 0.06 ) .",
    "the opacity tables for these metallicties are compiled by @xcite from @xcite and @xcite . for each @xmath15 , the initial hydrogen mass fraction is obtained from    @xmath16    since this relation can well reproduce the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of some clusters(@xcite ) .    instead of solving stellar structure equations of a wd",
    ", we adopt the prescription of @xcite on wds accreting hydrogen - rich material from their companions . in a wd + ms system",
    ", the companion fills its roche lobe at ms or during hg , and transfers material onto the wd .",
    "we assume that if the mass - transfer rate , @xmath17 , exceeds a critical value , @xmath18 , the accreted hydrogen - rich material steadily burns on the surface of wd , and is converted into helium at the rate of @xmath19 .",
    "the unprocessed matter is lost from the system as an optically thick wind at a rate of @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on the opacity from @xcite , the optically thick wind is very sensitive to fe abundance , and it is possible for the wind not to work when @xmath21 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , there should be an obvious low - metallicity threshold for sne ia in comparison with sn ii .",
    "however , this metallicity threshold was not found ( @xcite ) .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the opacities , we therefore assume rather arbitrarily that the optically thick wind is valid for all metallicities .",
    "the critical accretion rate is given by    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is hydrogen mass fraction and @xmath24 is the mass of the accreting wd ( mass is in @xmath8 and mass - accretion rate is in @xmath25 , @xcite ) . the effect of metallicities on equation ( 2 ) has not been included since the effect is very small and can be neglected ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted the following assumptions when @xmath26 .",
    "( 1 ) when @xmath27 , the hydrogen - shell burning is steady and no mass is lost from the system . ( 2 ) when @xmath28 , a very weak shell flash is triggered but no mass is lost from the system .",
    "( 3 ) when @xmath29 , the hydrogen - shell flash is so strong that no material can be accumulated by the accreting co wd .",
    "then , the growth rate of the mass of the helium layer under the hydrogen - burning shell can be defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass accumulation efficiency for hydrogen burning and its values is    @xmath32    when a certain amount of helium is accumulated , helium is ignited as a he - flash , and some of the helium is blown off from the surface of the co wd .",
    "then , the mass growth rate of the co wd , @xmath33 , is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass accumulation efficiency for helium - shell flashes , and its value is taken from @xcite .",

    "their companion masses are still unclear .",
    "the best - fit companion masses for the two recurrent novae are 1.50 @xmath8 , while @xmath41 is still accepted ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "so , based on our binary evolution calculation , v394 cra is a very likely progenitor of sn ia and ci aql is a possible progenitor of sn ia . a further observation to confirm their companion masses",
    "is necessary for judging their fates .",
    "another very famous recurrent nova is v 1974 cygni ( nova cygni 1992 ) , whose companion mass is 0.21 @xmath8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and orbital period is 0.0813 days ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "its position is outside the final contour in this paper .",
    "considering its low wd mass ( @xmath42 , @xcite ) , it is very unlikely for v 1974 cygni to become a sn ia ( see @xcite for similar discussions about these recurrent novae ) .    in figure",

    ", we only show the case of @xmath43 , since the other cases give similar results ( see fig . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we see from the figure that there is a clear trend for the initial and final contour to move to higher mass with metallicity .",
    "this is due to the correlation between stellar evolution and metallicity .",
    "generally , stars with high metallicity evolve in a way similar to those with low metallicity but less mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , for binaries of co wds with particular orbital periods , the companion mass increases with metallicity ( see @xcite in details ) .      , but only for case wind .",

    ", we only show the case of @xmath10 as a typifier , since the other cases give similar results ( see figure [ mmsz110 ] ) .",
    "in these two figure , we see that the range of initial ms masses with @xmath10 for the case wind is between 2.2 @xmath8 and 3.5 @xmath8 .",
    "however , the range strongly depends on metallicity , that is : the progenitor systems have more massive companions for a higher z ( see figure [ mmsz110 ] in this paper and fig . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that when @xmath46 , no case wind exists for @xmath10 .",
    "we get a similar results for @xmath10 .",
    "however , this result also rests on metallicity .",
    "for example , the mass limit for no wind is 0.8 @xmath8 for @xmath47 , while it is larger than 1.0 @xmath8 for @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , @xcite noticed that only when @xmath49 , wds explode at the optically thick wind phase as sne ia .",
    "their result is much different from that in this paper .",
    "the difference is derived from the different treatment on mass transfer between wd and ms and from different mass - loss mechanism from systems .",
    "firstly , they used a analytic method for treating binary interaction .",
    "this method can not describe certain mass - transfer phase , in particular those occurring on a thermal time - scale and may overestimate mass - transfer phase on the thermal time - scale ( @xcite ; see also the figs . 1 and 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , they assume a mass - stripping effect , that is : optically thick winds from wd collide with secondary and strip off its surface layer . this effect may attenuate the mass - transfer rate between wd and its companion , but the total mass - loss rate from secondary increases ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the two reasons above",
    ", more materials thus are lost from binary systems as the optically thick wind and stripped - off material before supernova explosion , and then the systems are more likely to explode after the optically thick wind .",
    "the material lost as the optically think wind forms circumstellar material ( csm ) which may result in a color excess of sne ia ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the csm is very close to sn ia for case wind , the ejecta of explosion may interact with the csm , and the sn ia might then be observed as supernovae like sn 2006x which show a variable na i d line ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we will discuss this in the future paper .    in the final contours",
    ", there is no special region for case wind ( see figure [ wind02 ] ) , that is : wds can explode as sne ia at any position in the final permitted region in the ( @xmath1 ) plane , which is much different from the case calm and the case nova ( see the following subsection ) .",
    ", but only for case calm .",

    "this is the reason why we call this `` case calm '' ( same to that in @xcite ) . during the steady hydrogen burning phase",
    ", the wd may be observed as a sss .",
    "the material lost as the optically thick wind forms csm , but it has been dispersed too washy to be detected immediately after the sn ia explosion . in figures",

    ", we only show the case of @xmath10 as a typifier , since the other cases give similar results ( see also figure [ mmsz110 ] ) . in figure [ sss02110 ] ,",
    "it is clear that there is gap for both initial system and final state in the ( @xmath0 ) plane , and the gap divides the case calm into two groups .",
    "the gap in the initial contour is the region for case wind and the area of the gap decrease with @xmath51 decreasing . when @xmath52 , the gap disappear ( see figure [ sss02 ] ) .",

    "when co wd mass increases to 1.378 @xmath8 , the secondary mass decreases to about 0.9 @xmath8 , which corresponds to the low - mass group in the final state contour of figure [ sss02110 ] .",
    "for the low - mass group in the initial contour of figure [ sss02110 ] , their mass ratio is not very large and only a small amount of hydrogen - rich materials lose as the optically thick wind , which means that most of transferred materials are accumulated on the wd .",
    "then , the secondary mass decreases slightly , which forms the high - mass group in the final state contour of figure [ sss02110 ] .    in figure [ sss02 ]",
    ", there is a blank region in the final state region for case calm ( around @xmath53-@xmath54 ) , which means that ssss may not be observed at this region before sne ia explosion .",
    "this phenomena is much different from that of case wind .",
    "the blank region is mainly derived from the low - mass group in the initial contour . for a system belonging to the group , mass transfer is almost conservative , and then the period is always decreasing since mass ratio is not reversed , which leads to the region absenting long - period systems . for a system in the high - mass",
    ", although its period decrease during optically thick wind , the period increases after mass - ratio reversion since no material loses from system and mass transfer becomes conservative ( see the panel ( h ) of fig.1 in @xcite ) .",

    "we call this `` case nova '' ( similar to @xcite ) . during the last recurrent nova phase , the amount of the hydrogen - rich material lost from system is very small . on the other hand , the material lost as the optically thick wind is already much far from the center of sn ia explosion",

    "since our results are based on detailed binary evolution calculation with latest input physics , our results are more realistic and the final contours in this paper are more likely to approach the real ones than those in @xcite ( see also in @xcite ) . because of the difference range of final companion as mentioned above , tycho g can be a likely progenitor of tycho s supernova in our model , but can not be in the model of @xcite .",
    "are shown .",
    "the black solid line shows the initial region of the progenitor for supernovae like sn 2002ic .",
    "two supersoft x - ray sources , rx j0513.9 - 6951 ( open star ) and v sge ( filled star ) , are plotted , whose masses are 2.7 @xmath8 and 3.5 @xmath8 ( @xcite ) , and whose orbital period are 0.76 days and 0.51 days , respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite).,width=226 ]    until sn 2002ic was discovered ( @xcite ) , it was long believed that there are no hydrogen lines in the spectra of sne ia .",
    "the strong hydrogen lines in the spectra of sn 2002ic were explained by the interaction between the sn ejecta and the circumstellar material ( csm ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , two co - twins of sn 2002ic ( sn 2005gj and sn 2006gy ) were also found ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to explain these rare objects ,",
    "many models were suggested and here we just list some of them : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite . among all the models listed above",
    ", the delayed dynamical instability model suggested by @xcite is more interesting and some predictions from the model seem to be consistent with observations , especially in a sense of the birth rate and delay time of these rare objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the scenario of @xcite ,",
    "sn 2002ic might be from the wd + ms channel , where the co wd accretes material from its relatively massive companion ( @xmath62 ) , and increases its mass to @xmath63 before experiencing a delayed dynamical instability . adopting their model , @xcite assumed that the co wd can increase its mass to 1.378 @xmath8 and explode as a sn 2002ic - like case if the mass of the co wd exceeds 1.30 @xmath8 before the delayed dynamical instability , and then predicted that supernovae like sn 2002ic may not be found in extremely low - metallicity environments . under the same assumption to @xcite , we show the permitted region for the delayed dynamical instability model with various metallicities in figure [ 120 ] . for the simplicity of the assumption ,",
    "the real region for the delayed dynamical instability model may be larger than that shown in figure [ 120 ] ( see fig . 5 in @xcite and fig .",
    "2 . in @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the permitted region for supernova like sn 2002ic locates above the contours for normal supernova .",
    "there is a overlap between supernova like sn 2002ic and normal sn ia , since a progenitor of supernova like sn 2002ic with low metallicity may have a lower mass than that of normal supernova .",
    "whatever , more evidence is necessary to confirm the scenario in @xcite , especially to find a progenitor system at present .    v sge is a well observed quasi - periodic transient sss in our galaxy .",
    "it switches optical state between a high ( @xmath64 mag ) and low ( @xmath65 mag ) state , and during the low state , very soft and very weak x - ray can be detected ( @xcite )",
    ". the mass - loss rate for v sge can be as large as @xmath66 indicated by radio observation .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite use optically thick wind to explain the observational property of v sge excellently , and in their model , the mass - loss rate may reaches as high as @xmath67 , which is consistent with radio observations .",
    "@xcite also estimated the wd mass as @xmath68 and its companion mass as @xmath69 , and then they suggested that v sge will explode as a sn ia after about @xmath70 .",
    "however , they must assume a mass - stripping effect , otherwise the position of v sge in ( @xmath0 ) plane will beyond the permitted region for stable mass transfer ( @xcite ) . we get a similar result to that in @xcite that v sge locates in a forbidden zone for stable mass transfer if there is no special assumption ( see in figure [ 120 ] ) .",
    "however , it locates at the boundary of the contour for supernovae like sn 2002ic as indicated in @xcite . considering the smaller region here than a real one and a moderately larger wd mass of v sge than that in this paper , v sge is a potential progenitor system that will undergo the delayed dynamical instability as suggested in @xcite .",
    "v sge thus would not explode as a normal sn ia , but one like sn 2002ic , if the model in @xcite is appropriate .",
    "then , we might regard  v sge - type star \" as the progenitor of supernovae like sn 2002ic if it belongs to wd + ms system .",
    "the lifetime of v sge - type star is typically @xmath71 , which is mainly due to the time - averaged wind mass - loss rate of @xmath67 ( @xcite ) . since no more than 1 in 100 sne ia belong to the subgroup of 2002ic - like supernova ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , there should be several v sge - type star belonging to wd + ms system in our galaxy if we take the galactic birth rate of sne ia as 3 - 4@xmath72 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite listed four v sge - type stars in the galaxy and discussed their similar spectroscopic and photometric properties . at present , their companion masses have not been identified , while their orbital periods is in the range of 0.2 - 0.5 days , which falls into the orbital periods predicted by our model ( see the final regions in figure [ mmsz110 ] ) .",
    "please notice that not all ssss belong to wd + ms systems and the nature of the compact star still remains an open question ( @xcite ) .",
    "white dwarfs , neutron stars , black holes , or even carbon main - sequence stars are all possible candidates ( @xcite ) .",
    "another alternative for the ssss is wd + he star system , which may also contribute to a few part of sne ia ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , considering the uncertainty of the nature of the four v sge - type star , our estimation on the number of v sge - type stars is consistent with observations .",
    "however , although the life , the mass - lose rate and the number of v sge - type star seem to match with the prediction from the delayed dynamical instability model , the case of @xmath73 is the only one in our model grids to account for the position of v sge in the ( @xmath0 ) plane , while there exist arguments on whether the mass of a co wd may be as large as @xmath74 and whether the co wd of @xmath74 may explode as a sn ia ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "so , obtaining a conclusion on whether there is a relation between v sge - type star and the delayed dynamical instability model is premature , and v sge is only a potential candidate for the progenitor of supernovae like sn 2002ic .",
    "adopting the prescription in @xcite for the mass accretion of co wds , we have carried out detailed binary evolution calculations for the progenitors of sne ia with different metallicity in the single - degenerate channel ( the wd + ms channel ) and obtained the initial and final parameters in the ( @xmath56 ) plane .",
    "our model may explain the positions of some famous recurrent novae in the ( @xmath0 ) plane , as well as a sss , rx j0513.9 - 6951 .",
    "our model can also explain the space velocity and mass of tycho g , which is now suggested to be the potential companion star of tycho s supernova ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "based on the delayed dynamically instable model in @xcite , we might regard v sge as a potential progenitor of supernova like sn 2002ic .",
