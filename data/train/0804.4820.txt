    "entanglement has been extensively studied in recent years because it has the fascinating nonclassical nature of quantum mechanics , and it plays a key role in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the quantum entanglement in solid state systems such as spin chains is an important emerging field @xcite , spin chains are natural candidates for the realization of entanglement , and spin has been researched in many other systems , such as superconductor @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , and trapped ion @xcite .    in order to characterize qualitatively and quantitatively the entanglement properties of condensed matter systems and apply them in quantum information , the thermal entanglement qualities in heisenberg model",
    "have been extensively studied @xcite , and many schemes of teleportation via thermal entangled state have been reported @xcite . in condensed matter systems ,",
    "the heisenberg chains have also been used to construct a quantum computer @xcite , perform quantum computation @xcite , and so on .    in those studies",
    "the spin - spin interaction was considered , but the spin - orbit coupling was rarely considered .",
    "especially the influences of x - component dm interaction parameter on the entanglement and the critical temperature have never been reported . in this paper",
    "we investigate the influence of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction parameter ( arising from the spin - orbit coupling ) and coupling coefficient @xmath0 on the entanglement of a two - qubit anisotropic heisenberg xxz spin chain .",
    "we show that the dm interaction parameter and the coupling coefficient @xmath0 are both efficient control parameters of entanglement , increasing them can enhance the entanglement or slow down the decreace of the entanglement .",
    "in addition , by analyzing we know that different component parameters of dm interaction have different influences on the entanglement and the critical temperature @xmath3 , the parameter @xmath1 ( x - component parameter of the dm interaction ) has a more remarkable influences than the parameter @xmath2 ( z - component parameter of the dm interaction ) .",
    "so more efficient control parameter can be obtained by changing the dm interaction direction .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the hamiltonian of the two - qubit anisotropic heisenberg xxz chain with the z - component parameter of the dm interaction , we calculate the concurrence of this system , analyze the influence of parameters on the entanglement in ground state and thermal state . in section iii , we similarly analyze the model of the two - qubit heisenberg xxz chain with the x - component parameter of the dm interaction .",
    "then we compare the influences of the two component parameters of the dm interaction on the entanglement in section iv . finally , in section v a discussion concludes the paper .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath4 for a two - qubit anisotropic heisenberg xxz chain with dm interaction parameter @xmath2 is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath0 are the real coupling coefficients , @xmath2 is the z - component parameter of dm interaction , @xmath7 are pauli matrices . the coupling constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the antiferromagnetic case , @xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to the ferromagnetic case .",
    "this model is reduced to isotropic xx model when @xmath12 and isotropic xxx model when @xmath13 .",
    "parameters @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 are dimensionless .    in the standard basis @xmath14 , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be expressed as @xmath15 by a straightforward calculation we can obtain @xmath4 eigenstates :    [ 3 ] @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19    with corresponding eigenvalues :    [ 4 ] @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the state of a spin chain system at thermal equilibrium is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 $ ] is the partition function of the system , @xmath4 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 is temperature and @xmath30 is the boltzmann costant which we take equal to 1 for simplicity . here",
    "@xmath31 represents a thermal state , so the entanglement in the thermal state is called thermal entanglement @xcite . in the above standard basis , the state of this system at thermal equilibrium can be expressed as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 $ ] .    in what follows",
    ", we consider the concurrence to quantify the amount of entanglement of the above two - qubit system state @xmath31 .",
    "the concurrence @xcite is defined as @xmath36 $ ] , where @xmath37 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath38 , in which @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the density matrix of the eq .",
    "( 5 ) , and the asterisk denote the complex conjugate . after some straightforward calculation , we get    [ 6 ] @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44    thus the corresponding concurrence can be expressed as : @xmath45 the concurrence is invariant under the substitutions @xmath46 and @xmath47 , so we can restrict @xmath8 and @xmath48 without loss of generality .",
    "the concurrence ranges from 0 to 1 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 indicate the vanishing entanglement and the maximal entanglement respectively .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "( 7 ) that the entanglement @xmath51 if @xmath52 , and @xmath49 if @xmath53 . here",
    "we analyze the @xmath52 case .    when @xmath54 , the system is in its ground state .",
    "it is easy to find that the ground - state energy is equal to    [ 8 ] @xmath55 @xmath56    thus , the ground state is the disentangled state @xmath57 or @xmath58 when @xmath53 , and the ground state is the entangled state @xmath59 when @xmath52 .",
    "the entanglement of the ground state @xmath59 is the maximal entanglement with @xmath60 .    as the temperature increases",
    ", thermal fluctuation will be introduced into the system , thus the entanglement will be changed due to the mix of the ground states and the excited states . when the temperature is higher than a critical temperature the entanglement is zero .",
    "quantum phase transition happens at the critical temperature @xmath3 . from eq .",

( 7 ) . by fixing some parameters we can know the roles of the other parameters and the variation of the entanglement . in fig .",
    "1 , the thermal entanglement is plotted versus @xmath29 and @xmath2 where the coupling constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 . from the figure",
    ", it s obvious that the increased temperature @xmath29 can decrease the entanglement .",
    "the reason is the mixing of the maximally entangled state with other states .",
    "in addition , it is easy to see that the entanglement will increase as the dm interaction parameter @xmath2 increases . fig .",
    "2 demonstrates the concurrence versus temperature for different dm coupling parameter @xmath2 when @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it shows that the concurrence will decrease with increasing temperature @xmath29 and increase with increasing @xmath2 for a certain temperature .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath3 determined by eq .",
    "( 9 ) is dependent on @xmath2 , increasing @xmath2 can increase the critical temperature above which the entanglement vanishes . similarly , fig .",
    "3 shows the concurrence versus temperature for different anisotropic coupling parameter @xmath0 when @xmath62 and @xmath64 .",
    "we can see that the entanglement decrease with the increase of temperature , and by increasing @xmath0 , the critical temperature is increased and the entanglement is enhanced for a certain temperature .",
    "so the dm interaction parameter @xmath2 and anisotropic coupling coefficient @xmath0 are both efficient control parameters of entanglement , by increasing them , we can enhance the entanglement or increase the critical temperature to slow down the decreace of the entanglement .",
    "here we consider the case of the two - qubit anisotropic heisenberg xxz chain with dm interaction parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath65 where @xmath1 is the x - component parameter of dm interaction , @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath7 are the same as those in section ii .",
    "parameters @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 are dimensionless .    in the standard basis @xmath14 , the hamiltonian ( 10 ) can be rewritten as @xmath66 after a straightforward calculation we obtain @xmath67 eigenstates :    [ 12 ] @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71    with corresponding eigenvalues :    [ 13 ] @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75    where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .    for convenience of analysis",
    ", we assume @xmath79 in this section ( for the case @xmath80 we can get some similar results ) . here , it is easy to see that the system ground - state energy is @xmath81 , thus the corresponding ground state @xmath82 is the maximally entangled state with @xmath83 .",
    "in fact the four eigenstates in eq .",
    "( 12 ) are all the maximally entangled states , this phenomenon indicates that the ground states have more entanglement in this system than the system of eq .",
    "( 1 ) .    at thermal equilibrium",
    "the density matrix of this two - qubit spin chain system has the following form : @xmath84 where @xmath85 + 2e^{\\beta j}\\cosh(\\beta w^{'})$ ] is the partition function of the system , @xmath67 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath28 with the boltzmann costant @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .    in",
    "what follows , we calculate the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the complex conjugate of @xmath92 and @xmath39 .",

    "4 , the concurrence is plotted versus @xmath29 and @xmath1 when the coupling constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is evident that increasing temperature will decrease the entanglement , and increasing @xmath1 will enhance the entanglement and increase the critical temperature @xmath101 which is determined by eq .",
    "5 demonstrates that the concurrence versus @xmath29 for different @xmath0 with x - component parameter @xmath99 and @xmath62 , it is easy to find that increasing @xmath0 can increase the critical temperature and enhance the entanglement for a certain temperature .",
    "so @xmath1 and @xmath0 are both efficient control parameters of entanglement , too .",
    "from section ii and section iii , we know that the x - component parameter @xmath1 and the z - component parameter @xmath2 of dm interaction have the similar qualities .",
    "they are both efficient control parameters of entanglement , increasing them can enhance the entanglement or increase the critical temperature to slow down the decrease of entanglement .     for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , here @xmath62 and @xmath63 . ]    in this section , we mainly analyze the differences between x - component parameter and z - component parameter .",
    "we note that there is less disentanglement region in fig . 4 than fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and the temperature and the spin - orbit coupling parameter have the same range .",
    "we also see that increasing x - component parameter @xmath1 can make the entanglement increase more rapidly , for example , when @xmath104 the concurrence increases more rapidly in fig . 4 than fig .",
    "1 . these phenomena denote that x - component parameter @xmath1 has a more remarkable influence than the z - component parameter @xmath2 . in fig . 6 ,",
    "the concurrence is plotted as a function of the temperature @xmath29 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is easy to see that for the same @xmath1 and @xmath2 , x - component parameter @xmath1 has a higher critical temperature and more entanglement for a certain temperature than z - component parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we show distinctly the differences between different dm interaction parameters in fig . 6 . so using the dm interaction parameters in different directions",
    ", we can increase the entanglement and the critical temperature with different efficiencies .",
    "the entanglement of a two - qubit heisenberg xxz system with different dm interaction parameters have been investigated .",
    "the dm interaction parameter and coupling coefficient @xmath0 are efficient control parameters of the entanglement . by increasing the parameters",
    ", we can enhance the entanglement or increase the critical temperature to slow down the decreace of the entanglement .",
    "in addition , we have also investigated the differences between x - component dm interaction parameter @xmath1 and z - component parameter @xmath2 .",
    "entanglement can be increased more rapidly by increasing @xmath1 than @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath1 and @xmath2 have the same value , @xmath1 has a higher critical temperature than @xmath2 .",
    "thus , by changing the direction of dm interaction , we can obtain a more efficient control parameter to increase the entanglement and the critical temperature .",
