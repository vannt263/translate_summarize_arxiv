    "the ideal host combines a small gap with a large exciton binding and high stability with respect to external perturbations .    as a consequence of its zero - gap single - particle bandstructure , single - layer graphene ( slg ) seems a promising candidate for an excitonic insulator . due to the linear dispersion slg exhibits massless , chiral dirac fermions which attracted significant interest recently .",
    "in particular , the formal analogy between spontaneous exciton condensation and chiral symmetry breaking in qed has been discussed by several authors@xcite .",
    "the linear dispersion and chiral nature of the quasiparticles in slg leads to fundamental differences in the effects of e  e interactions as compared to the conventional two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "recent analysis@xcite of the wannier equation with a linear dispersion shows that exciton binding in slg requires a minimum effective coulomb coupling strength , in general agreement with other theoretical investigations@xcite .",
    "the actual strength of the coulombic coupling in slg is still a subject of debate@xcite .",
    "combination of the static limit of the standard lindhard formula with experimentally measured values for the fermi velocity predicts values for the coulombic coupling that are slightly larger than the critical value , thus allowing for a small but finite gap .",
