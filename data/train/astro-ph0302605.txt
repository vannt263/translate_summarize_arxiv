    "whenever one makes a physical measurement one obtains a discrete result , starting from spatial measurements and ending with classification of some set of objects by some quantity .",
    "particular measured value follows from the statistical properties of the system strictly following the probability distribution function , hereafter pdf .",
    "the pdf , in its turn , is determined by the physical properties of the system .",
    "if a measured data set is statistically complete then its pdf contains information about the system s physical properties .",
    "the pdf shows a character of unimodal or multimodal systems .",
    "it is natural to assume that the pdf of unimodal physical systems contain only one global maximum and several maxima indicate the multimodality of a data set .",
    "therefore the shape of the pdf allows one to classify the measured data points , e.g.  to find structure in case of positional measurements .    in statistics it is widely accepted to use histograms as the pdf approximations .",
    "it is also well known that ordinary histograms being dependent on two free parameters ( bin size and its location ) give very subjective results .",
    "many methods have been developed trying to solve this problem @xcite",
    ". however , most of them are still dependent on some parameters in a non - objective manner .",
    "generally , the probability density estimation methods can be divided into two main groups : parametric and non - parametric .",
    "the first ones assume some definite type of the pdf function ( e.g. gaussian or their superposition ) and try to find the best - fit parameters for it .",
    "a good such example is the kmm mixture modelling algorithm @xcite",
    ". a main disadvantage of these methods is that not all data sets can be well fitted with any chosen function .",
    "rather often the real pdf of physical system has significant difference from a chosen best - fit function , and in many cases it is not known _ a priori _ what function it should be at all .",
    "non - parametric methods try to construct pdf estimates as compromise of two opposite demands .",
    "first , the estimate should be as close as possible to the measured pdf .",
    "second , statistical noise due to a finite volume of the selection should be filtered out .",
    "there are several ways how to do it .",
    "it is possible to minimize a functional that is a sum of two terms  the statistical noise and the one increasing with a difference between data points and the pdf estimate ( vondrak s method ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is still one free coefficient responsible for the smoothing degree .",
    "this coefficient is not determined in any automated way and usually is found from good - looking conditions .",
    "another method is to convolve the initial guess of the pdf with some kernel ( kernel methods ) for data smoothing .",
    "also in this case there remains a free coefficient  the kernel width , that is responsible for smoothing of the function in an `` optimal way '' , besides the result is weakly dependent on the chosen kernel shape @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a method that allows one to choose an optimal smoothing width : the pdf should not be over - smoothed and lose its true features , and the noise level should be diminished as far as possible on the other hand .",
    "this method is described e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "its main idea is to define an integrated square error ( @xmath0 ) function that shows the difference between the real pdf and its estimate , and then to minimize it .",
    "the @xmath0 function method is implemented for kernel methods in e.g.   @xcite , and results are encouraging .",
    "however , the @xmath0 function itself is often rather noisy .    in this paper",
    "we propose another approach to estimate pdf of a given one - dimensional data set in automatic and optimal way .",
    "this is the spline histogram method .",
    "we have found that the tensioned cubic splines are suitable for this task and the corresponding algorithm has been called tcsplin .",
    "the current version of the tcsplin code is freely available in the internet , it is also included in the cd - rom .    for demonstration purposes in this article we will use the spline histogram algorithm to find a `` well determined '' redshift structure of galaxies within clusters abell 2256 and abell 3626 .",
    "this paper has the following structure .",
    "the spline histogram algorithm will be discussed in section  [ sha ] . bootstrapping simulations , discussed in section  [ sda ] , help to evaluate errors of the pdf estimates . in section  [ clu ]",
    "the spline histogram application to data sets of clusters of galaxies a2256 and a3526 will be shown as examples .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks will be given in section  [ beigas ] .",
    "the spline histogram method is a non - parametric approach for reconstruction of probability density function underlying statistical selection .",
    "it was first discussed in @xcite as one of possible methods to detect substructure in clusters of galaxies .",
    "recently it was further developed in @xcite and these results are summarized in this paper .    from spectroscopic observations we obtain redshifts of galaxies in clusters .",
    "let us denote redshift of the @xmath1th galaxy by @xmath2 and order them ascendentally ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "next step is to construct a step - like cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) obtained purely from observational data : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a number of galaxies with redshift smaller than @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a total number of detected galaxies , @xmath8 is the speed of light . at this stage",
    "we assume that the data set is statistically complete being representative of the physical situation .",
    "the pdf @xmath9 by definition is the derivative of @xmath10 in respect to @xmath11 .",
    "if cdf is constructed as shown before then @xmath9 is a sum of dirac @xmath12-functions .    in the spline histogram method the points @xmath13 with ordinates",
    "@xmath14 are consequently connected by non - decreasing smooth analytical spline @xmath15 .",
    "after construction of @xmath15 the latter is analytically differentiated leading to the pdf estimate @xmath16 .",
    "this procedure guarantees that the obtained continuous pdf is in agreement with the discrete distribution of the data points .",
    "the pdf contains all initially observed information about the cluster and it has a lot of noise as a consequence . to diminish the noise",
    ", @xmath16 has to be smoothed .    trying to utilize usual cubic splines for interpolation of the cdf ,",
    "one encounters the problem that they will generally have negative derivative intervals if both first and second derivatives in the data points are put to be equal .",
    "although there is an infinite amount of possibilities how to construct a smooth continuous spline that has non - smooth first derivative at data points .",
    "we have found that tensioned cubic splines ( hereafter tcs ) nicely fit all spline histogram needs .",
    "they are defined such that the cubic polynomial spline length between two data points is minimal , and only the interpolating function and its first derivative are continuous in data points .",
    "also in this case sometimes a derivative of the tcs is negative .",
    "then in order to exclude a non - physical decreasing of the cdf estimate , we use non - tensioned splines increasing accordingly the spline length within these regions .    to reduce the statistical noise",
    ", the algorithm has been symmetrized .",
    "for the same purpose there was added a possibility to unite close points in the data set , that would otherwise give unphysical high pdf peaks .",
    "nevertheless the resulting pdf is noisy and due to this the next step of the algorithm is a smoothing procedure .    in our case",
    "the noise is seen as narrow high peaks in the pdf arising from high cdf derivatives between close data points .",
    "the savitzky - golay filters @xcite have been chosen for the smoothing remembering that pdf construction without any _ a priori _ knowledge about the system character was one of the main reasons for developing the spline histograms .",
    "these filters locally conserve first moments of the smoothed function .",
    "the remaining problem is to define the optimal width of the filter such that it reduces the noise but not over - smoothes the real pdf features .",
    "this is done using the integrated square error ( @xmath0 ) function @xcite : @xmath17where @xmath18 is a true pdf underlying the observed selection , and @xmath16 is a pdf estimated from the observed data , i.e.  the smoothed spline histogram in our case . as we are using digital filters to smooth the data , this should be rewritten for case of discrete points .",
    "it follows from the theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that quantity @xmath19 will have minimum for the same smoothing width @xmath20 as @xmath21 : @xmath22where @xmath23 are the smoothing filter zeroth coefficients , and it was taken into account that @xmath24 . in contrary to the equation defining the @xmath0 function , @xmath19 can be easily calculated from the data .    the filter width that gives the minimal @xmath19 value is the optimal one because the corresponding deviation between the true and estimated pdfs is also minimized . as a result",
    "the spline histogram is obtained but it says nothing about the remaining statistical noise level in it . to find it out we use a bootstrapping technique described in the next section .",
    "simulated data are produced and analysed as follows . using the obtained spline histogram as a true pdf , we generate the same amount @xmath25 of random numbers .",
    "then from this selection we compute another smoothed spline histogram . repeating this sufficient number of times ( say 100 )",
    ", one can calculate the average of the simulated spline histograms and its scattering .",
    "it is useful to characterize the scattering by the distribution quartiles .",
    "the upper quartile shows that the estimated pdf has 75% probability to be below it . for the lower quartile , accordingly ,",
    "this probability is 25% ( see fig .",
    "[ sim500 ] ) .",
    ".moments of the initial distribution from simulations of the 500 point selection [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to estimate the quality of the approximation , the first moments of several simulated distributions were computed and compared with the original values ( see table  [ sim ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the average values are the same within statistical error bars ( @xmath26 ) , whereas the standard deviations are about 10% larger than the original values because of the smoothing effect . for gaussian distributions",
    "the asymmetry and excess are significantly different from zero , although in non - gaussian cases they are rather close to original values .",
    "dependence of the smoothing size on the selection volume was also analysed . from theoretical considerations",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we know that the optimal smoothing size depends on the selection volume @xmath25 in the following way : @xmath27 . analysing different volume random number selections for the same initial distribution , we have empirically found that for our algorithm @xmath28 , that shows an excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as example we show the implementation of the algorithm on two clusters of galaxies  abell 2256 and 3526 .",
    "abell 2256 is a rich regular cluster at @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , equinox 2000.0 @xcite ) .",
    "it has similar properties to the coma cluster ( similar x - ray luminosities , both have optical and x - ray substructure and a radio halo ) , but is situated approximately 2.5 times farther .",
    "a2256 has been previously studied in x - rays , optical and radio by several authors , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is accepted and understood , that abell 2256 , being one of the best studied clusters of galaxies , exhibit complex inner structure .    , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    result of the implementation of the tcsplin algorithm to the data of fabricant , consisting of 89 galaxy redshift measurements , is shown in fig .",
    "[ a2256 ] . from the figure",
    "one can obviously see that the cluster is unrelaxed and has strongly non - gaussian velocity pdf .",
    "most likely it consists of two or more merging parts that currently are undergoing a final stage of unification .",
    "centaurus cluster a3526 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , equinox 2000.0 @xcite ) has been extensively studied , as it is a nearby rich cluster of galaxies .",
    "it is intermediate between coma and virgo clusters in richness and in distance and has richness class 1 or 2 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "centaurus is irregular in appearance , like virgo .",
    "the cluster core has two apparent centres of concentration , one being centred on ngc 4696 and the other being @xmath35 further east ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "extensive study of this cluster is made in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the research included determination of redshifts for 259 galaxies and photometry for 329 galaxies within @xmath36 field centred on the cluster , and the following analysis of data . the bimodal galaxy velocity distribution and extensive substructure in both subclusters have been found .",
    "mean heliocentric velocities and line - of - sight dispersions of two main cluster components , within @xmath37 of the cluster centre , are 3041 and 586 km sec@xmath38 ( denoted cen30 ) , and 4570 and 262 km sec@xmath38 ( denoted cen45 ) , respectively .",
    "the projected distributions of members of each component overlap on the sky .",
    "other small galaxy groups also have been found in this study .",
    "recently bimodality of the cluster has been confirmed in @xcite .",
    "the authors used it to test a non - parametric method of the pdf estimation proposed by @xcite and the same two main features of the cluster were noticed .",
    "our result of processing the data set of @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ a3526 ] .",
    "we find the same two main structures as in the original analysis .",
    "clearness of these features demonstrates the quality of the algorithm .",
    "shape of each of these components is close to gaussian indicating their relatively relaxed state . besides that the spline histogram shows additional left `` shoulder '' of the cen30 group at around @xmath39 km sec@xmath38 .",
    "this probably is one of separate groups noticed by dickens3 .",
    "possibly this as well as those features around 6200 and 8300 km  sec@xmath38 are not spatially real but just the redshift space caustics artefacts .",
    "we see that a direct implementation of the algorithm leads to a good estimate of the pdf of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the only difference is the dispersions of the group velocities that are overestimated due to our pdf smoothing .",
    "one should keep that in mind and calculate the dispersion directly from the original data if needed .",
    "this paper has demonstrated the usefulness of the spline histogram algorithm in statistical studies of 1d data sets .",
    "it has all advantages over the well known ordinary histogram approach estimating the probability density functions . in principle",
    "the spline histograms may be expanded to higher dimensional cases but that introduces higher effect of the sampling noise .",
    "unfortunately enlargement of a data set size does not necessarily guarantee larger signal to noise ratio .",
    "more generally it is dependent on the distribution character .",
    "the latest version of the spline histogram algorithm tcsplin code is freely available online from http://www.virac.lv/en/soft.html .",
