    "coherence is a central theme in quantum physics . in feynman s",
    "words on quantum theory @xcite , it is _ the only mystery_. a good definition of coherence depends on two things @xcite : the state of the system , @xmath0 , and the alternatives under consideration , usually attached to different eigenvalues of an observable @xmath1 . whenever @xmath0 is written in a basis ,",
    "the non - diagonal elements of @xmath0 are called _ coherences _ ( with respect to that basis ) since they can originate the oscillating patterns which characterize interference .",
    "curiously , measurements of @xmath1 can not show the effects of such coherences .",
    "the mean value of @xmath1 is simply the wheighted sum of its proper values .",
    "however , observables which do not commute with @xmath1 can reveal them .",
    "naturally , when @xmath0 is diagonalized , there is no relevant coherence with respect to that basis .",
    "a state which is diagonal in whatever basis can show no coherence at all . in finite dimensions",
    "this is the case of the totally mixed state , @xmath2 , @xmath3 denoting the identity operator and @xmath4 the dimension of the state space . in this sense , @xmath5",
    "can also be called _ the _ incoherent state .",
    "quantum systems are not isolated .",
    "they naturally interact with their environment .",
    "when such interaction is taken into account , a _ decoherence _ process usually appears @xcite . in this context",
    ", decoherence can be understood as the vanishing of the non - diagonal terms of the density matrix @xmath0 , which usually occurs as an exponential decay with a timescale @xmath6 much smaller then the usual damping time @xmath7 .",
    "decoherence is even seen as the bridge from quantum mechanics to the classical world , in washing out the interference terms .    in the last decades",
    ", a special consequence of `` the only mystery '' has gained central status in quantum mechanics : _",
    "entanglement_. a good definition of entanglement also depends on two things @xcite : the state of the system and a division of such system in meaningfull parties @xcite .",
    "the most paradigmatic context is the bipartite scenario , when the parts are attached to remote experimentalists , alice and bob .",
    "the state space then takes the form of a tensor product @xmath8 .",
    "observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 are _",
    "local_. states of the form @xmath11 show no correlation at all , in the sense that local observables are statistically independent .",
    "states of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a probability distribution , are called _ classically correlated _ or _ separable _ @xcite .",
    "the results of measurements of local observables on separable states can be strongly correlated . a good example , in spin notation",
    ", is the state @xmath14 .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath15-component of spin in both parts are perfectly correlated . but",
    "this correlation is classical .",
    "a bipartite state is entangled if it can not be written as eq .  .",
    "recently , interesting effects were recognized in the open system treatment of entangled - state dynamics . in particular ,",
    "if two qubits are subjected to very natural reservoirs , their entanglement can vanish in finite time , even when coherence only vanishes asymptotically @xcite .",
    "this effect was latter called _ sudden death of entanglement _",
    "it is conjectured to be a quite generic result .",
    "a proposal for its experimental detection was already made @xcite and implemented @xcite .",
    "however , it is yet considered as a surprising effect , waiting for a simple geometric explanation @xcite .    in this article",
    "we give such a geometric interpretation to the sudden death of entanglement .",
    "this interpretation allows for the explanation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for it to happen .",
    "for simplicity , we concentrate in the two qubit scenario , despite the fact that large dimensions and large number of parties can bring new interesting developements @xcite .",
    "entanglement can be viewed as a consequence of non - local coherence .",
    "in fact , a state like @xmath16 exhibits coherence with respect to the nonlocal obervable @xmath17 .",
    "this example is very illustrative , since its entanglement can vanish in a finite time or only asymptotically , depending on the reservoir it is subjected to . for a sudden death situation , one can use independent spontaneous decay with positive temperature @xcite , while an asymptotic regime is obtained for a dephasing noise @xcite or for independent spontaneous decay at null temperature @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the separation between alice and bob is fixed ( in the sense that we only use the canonical tensor product structure @xcite ) , and coherence will be studied with respect to the usual computational basis . for convenience",
    ", we will adopt a notation similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , by using as a basis @xmath18 the global density matrix takes the form    @xmath19},\\ ] ]    and the local ( reduced ) density matrices are @xmath20},\\\\ \\rho _ b & = & { \\left [     \\begin{array}{cc }    \\rho _ { 11 } + \\rho _ { 33 } & \\rho _ { 12 } + \\rho _ { 34}\\\\    \\rho _ { 21 } + \\rho _ { 43 } & \\rho _ { 22 } + \\rho _ { 44 }    \\end{array }    \\right]}. \\ ] ]    the first important geometric aspect appears here .",
    "our problem starts on a manifold of ( real ) dimension @xmath21 given by the positive operators in @xmath22 with unit trace .",
    "if we want system @xmath1 not to show any coherence with respect to the computational basis , we need to have @xmath23 while if we want to see no coherence for the computational basis of system @xmath24 we must obey @xmath25 as each of these equations are complex , they represent a system of two real equations each . accordingly , each set of states incoherent with respect to local @xmath26 is a subset of dimension @xmath27 .",
    "if we want both local coherences to vanish then we get an even smaller subset , of dimension @xmath28 .    from now on",
    ", we will adopt the strategy of focus on the so called @xmath29 states ( due to the appearance of their density matrices , see eq .  )",
    "@xcite , defined by @xmath30 this set has real dimension @xmath31 . for any natural volume measure ,",
    "all those sets of local incoherent states have zero measure ( like a line in @xmath32 ) . on the opposite direction ,",
    "the set of unentangled states is known to have positive measure ( in particular , the same dimensionality as the ambient ) @xcite . in a sense ( _ e.g. _ by random choices ) it is much more probable to pick an unentangled state than a locally incoherent state .    explicitly reparameterizing the set , we consider density matrices of the form @xmath33},\\ ] ] which shows no local coherence with respect to the computational basis . despite being `` small '' in the mathematical sense described above",
    ", this set contains some important subsets like the states which can be written as a mixture of bell states ( under the conditions @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) , and werner states @xcite ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) .",
    "let us discuss a little bit more the notions of non - local coherence and separability inside this set .",
    "the block structure of density matrices of the form ( more evident if the basis is re - ordered ) strongly simplifies the use of peres - horodecki criterion @xcite to test for the existence of entanglement .",
    "it implies that @xmath0 is entangled iff @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "the positivity of @xmath0 implies @xmath41 and @xmath42 , hence only one of the above conditions can be fulfilled . by the same conditions , if one of the populations is null , say @xmath43 , then @xmath37 and for any non - null value of @xmath15 the state is entangled",
    "this is a possible strategy to obtain persistent entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the elements @xmath15 and @xmath44 are non - local coherences , in the sense that they appear in the mean values of obervables like @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "sudden death of entanglement @xcite can then be characterized as the finite time disentanglement of a state , even when non - local coherences are still present , and usually decay exponentially .",
    "now let us treat the two qubits as an open system .",
    "there is a large collection of natural reservoirs that can be considered ( and an even larger one that can be engineered ) , but let us just divide them into classes .",
    "the first question is if they have a single asymptotic state ( in the sense that all initial states tend asymptotically to the same point ) or not .",
    "a good example of the first case is spontaneous decay , while a dephasing noise is an example of the second .",
    "if the system is subjected to a reservoir with only one asymptotic state , three very diferent situations can happen ( see fig .",
    "[ oneasymp ] ) : i ) the asymptotic state can be an internal point of the separable states set ( _ e.g. _ for random noise or finite temperature thermal reservoirs for independent qubits ) ; ii ) the asymptotic state can be separable but at the boundary of such set ( _ e.g. _ zero temperature spontaneous decay of two independent qubits ) ; or iii ) the asymptotic state can be entangled ( _ e.g. _ low temperature reservoirs for some interacting two - qubit hamiltonians or collective decay of two otherwise independent qubits ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the generalization of situation iii ) of the previous case , corresponding to the new situation iii ) when @xmath47 , is also geometrically possible , but the non - convexity of @xmath48 makes it harder to find dynamically . if one takes two different entangled states , there is no guarantee that their convex combinations remain entangled .",
    "the most famous example is for a pair of bell states : any equal mixture of two bell states is separable .",
    "another important restriction is that @xmath49 can not contain a whole set of projectors @xmath50 for any two - dimensional subspace of @xmath51 .",
    ", a quadric complex surface , while each two - dimensional subspace of @xmath22 corresponds to a projective line @xmath52 .",
    "this two sets must intersect , by the bezout theorem @xcite . ] with respect to the dynamics of entanglement , this situation behaves in a way analogous to the single entangled asymptotic point : after a finite amount of time , only entangled states can be found . to obtain krauss operators for a reservoir like",
    "this is yet an open problem .",
    "the remaining possibility happens when @xmath49 contains both separable and entangled states .",
    "for this situation , all the behaviours previously discussed are , in principle , possible .",
    "let us just discuss one general and interesting example of this class : two non - interacting identical qubits subjected to collective phase noise .",
    "in this situation , the asymptotic states are of the form with @xmath37 .",
    "this is a five dimensional manifold ( remember @xmath15 is complex and @xmath53 ) containing both separable and entangled states . in this example , initial states like    @xmath54}\\ ] ]    exhibit asymptotic decay of entanglement , while @xmath55}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 show sudden death ; on the other hand , initially separable states remain separable for all times , while entangled states like @xmath57}\\ ] ] remain fixed as a consequence of the existence of a decoherence free subspace @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we affirm that the curious effect of sudden death of entanglement is an example of a large class of interesting behaviours which open quantum system can show .",
    "it also brings together a rich geometrical flavour .",
    "this geometrical reasoning makes simpler the decision of when entanglement should be destroyed in finite time , when it can even be created by damping , and when qualitatively different time evolutions can coexist in the same system .",
    "a natural question which appears from this work is how to give examples , in theory and in laboratory , for each different possible geometrical situation .",
    "another is about the existence of a maximum number of possible `` entanglement resurrections '' under some natural restrictions on the reservoirs .",
    "generalizations are also in order : large dimensional bipartite systems can exhibit new features with respect to sudden death of entanglement and its geometry .",
    "for example , has bound entanglement any special behaviour with respect to sudden death ?",
    "another natural generalization deals with multipartite entanglement .",
    "it is clear from the geometrical picture that the effect can take place in such context , but as now different kinds of entanglement appear , the classification scheme becomes much trickier .",
