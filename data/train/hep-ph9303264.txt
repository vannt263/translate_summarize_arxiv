    "light - front dynamics has found frequent application in particle and nuclear physics .",
    "first introduced by dirac  @xcite , it has the advantage that , of the ten generators of transformations for the poincar group , only three of them depend upon interaction dynamics . in particular , certain forms of lorentz boosts are interaction independent .",
    "this is in contrast to the more traditionally used instant - form dynamics , which has four interacting generators , including _ all _ boosts .",
    "however , as with all forms of relativistic dynamics , more generators than just the light - front `` hamiltonian '' @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a spatial unit vector , must depend nontrivially on the interaction , and these generators correspond to rotations about axes perpendicular to @xmath2 .",
    "this is especially important when computing matrix elements of electromagnetic and weak currents in the front form .",
    "because the current operator must have the transformation properties of a four - vector , and some of these transformations are interaction dependent , it must also depend upon the strong interaction . in particular , the current operator can not satisfy all of the covariance requirements associated with transverse rotations without containing interaction dependent components .",
    "this is sometimes called the `` angular condition ''  @xcite .",
    "rotational covariance has been studied in a variety of contexts . for hadrons composed of quarks , terentev and",
    "others have examined the extent to which the current operator is uniquely determined without knowing its two - body components . for elastic electron - deuteron scattering , the lack of uniqueness modulo two - body currents has been explored by employing a variety of `` schemes '' to satisfy the rotational covariance requirement  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine a specific rotational constraint for light - front current matrix elements of hadrons composed of quarks",
    ". the current operator must satisfy certain nontrivial commutation relations with the interacting generators of the poincar group .",
    "the requirement of current covariance for rotations about an axis perpendicular to @xmath2 gives rise to constraints on current matrix elements for elastic scattering from particles of spin 1 or greater  @xcite .",
    "while form factors of the pion  @xcite and the nucleon  @xcite have frequently been calculated , the particular test discussed here is not applicable because @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore take a model of a @xmath0 meson as a prototype hadron to which to apply the rotational covariance test .",
    "in light - front dynamics , full rotational covariance implies a nontrivial set of conditions which any hadronic model must in principle satisfy .",
    "first , the state vector for the hadron must be an eigenstate of the total spin operator .",
    "this condition is satisfied in light - front models which use a quantum mechanical hilbert space with a fixed number of particles  @xcite .",
    "models using a field theory , in particular those motivated by qcd , may not necessarily use rotationally covariant state vectors . at high @xmath4",
    ", this deficiency may be irrelevant if the corrections to rotational covariance fall as a power of @xmath4 . at moderate and low @xmath4",
    ", the issue may be important . in any event",
    ", we consider here only models whose state vectors have the proper rotational covariance properties .",
    "second , the current operator @xmath5 must satisfy the conditions of lorentz covariance .",
    "if @xmath6 is the matrix for a homogeneous lorentz transformation and @xmath7 is a spacetime translation , then @xmath8 it must be conserved with respect to the four - momentum . if @xmath9 is the generator of spacetime translations , then @xmath10 = 0 .",
    "\\label{kae}\\ ] ] these constraints have two implications .",
    "first , it is possible to express the physical content of current matrix elements between any two states in terms of a limited number of lorentz invariant functions of the masses of the states and the square of the momentum transfer .",
    "second , the operator @xmath11 must have in general a complicated structure , since it obeys nontrivial commutation relations with at least some generators which are interaction dependent .    to illustrate these two points , consider current matrix elements with spacelike momentum transfer .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that all spin matrix elements of the current four - vector can be computed from the set of matrix elements of @xmath12 in a frame in which @xmath13 .",
    "alternatively , it means that all invariant form factors can be computed from matrix elements of @xmath12 .",
    "however , the covariance requirements imply that the matrix elements of @xmath12 must satisfy a set of constraints .",
    "this is particularly relevant if a one - body operator has been used to compute the matrix elements .",
    "if a constraint involves transformations which use poincar generators which are non - interacting , it will in general be satisfied for matrix elements computed with one - body operators .",
    "however , constraints which involve transformations using interacting generators will in general not be satisfied with one - body current matrix elements .",
    "an interaction - dependent constraint can be derived by requiring that breit - frame matrix elements of the transverse current in a helicity basis vanish if the magnitude of the helicity flip is 2 or greater . for light - front current matrix elements",
    "@xmath14 and spin @xmath15 , the condition is expressed as follows : @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ baa ] ) , @xmath17 is a light - front momentum , and the matrix element is evaluated in a frame where @xmath18 , and the perpendicular component of @xmath19 and @xmath20 lies along the @xmath21 axis .",

    "( [ baa ] ) is modified only by the use of @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the rotation matrices for the final state . for elastic scattering ,",

    "earlier studies of the deuteron form factors using models with one - body currents and rotationally covariant state vectors indicate that @xmath33 can be relatively small for low and moderate @xmath4 , though , not surprisingly , @xmath33 is an increasing function of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the deuteron is that the characteristic nucleon momentum is very small compared to a nucleon mass .    for most quark models of hadrons ,",
    "the characteristic constituent momentum is not small with respect to the quark mass , and questions of rotational covariance therefore require a separate investigation .",
    "there have been previous studies of the pion  @xcite and the nucleon  @xcite form factors using models with one - body currents and rotationally covariant state vectors .",
    "equation  ( [ bbb ] ) has no counterpart for spin zero and spin @xmath34 , so the dynamical aspect of rotational covariance was not addressed in those works .",
    "some other conclusions from those studies which are relevant to the discussion below include    1 .   for small quark masses ( 10 mev ) , relativistic effects such as those of melosh rotations can be substantial , even at low @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   in the limit @xmath35",

    "we examine a model for a @xmath0 meson similar to those used for the pion published earlier , in light of the rotational covariance condition  ( [ bbb ] ) at both low and high @xmath4 .",
    "the model @xmath0 meson is composed of a valence quark and an antiquark . since it must be color - antisymmetric and flavor - symmetric ( isospin 1 ) , the space - spin wave function must be symmetric . for the ground state , we take the coupled states @xmath38 .",
    "this is the same space - spin combination as that of a deuteron composed of two nucleons .",
    "since the details of such a deuteron form factor calculation are discussed extensively elsewhere  @xcite , only the unique features of the quark model will be presented here .",

    "the relativistic effects are smaller than the corresponding cases where @xmath71 = 750 mev , but the nonrelativistic limit is still not really reached until the quark masse is considerably larger than the momentum scale @xmath66 . for this choice of meson mass , and for all three choices of quark mass ,",
    "the covariance function @xmath33 is much smaller for the same range of @xmath4 than in the previous three figures .    from the results shown here , along with those of other parameter sets ,",
    "it becomes clear that the rotational covariance uncertainty function @xmath33 becomes comparable to @xmath69 , and hence the current matrix elements themselves , when @xmath72 is of order unity .",
    "thus , for a @xmath0 meson with physical mass 750 mev , the breakdown of rotational covariance occurs in the region 12 @xmath73 . this can be understood from the fact that the dimensionless argument of the melosh rotations in eq .",

    "( [ bbb ] ) .",
    "the dynamical nature of the rotational covariance condition is contained in the presence of the interacting mass @xmath76 .",
    "note also that , for elastic scattering , the current matrix elements @xmath57 depend upon the quark mass @xmath41 and the momentum transfer , _ but they do not depend upon the composite mass @xmath76_. the internal melosh rotations , which give a measure of size of relativistic effects , depend upon the quark mass , but the composite mass enters _ only _ at the point of computing form factors and evaluating the rotational covariance condition .",
    "as noted above , it has been shown that , for the pion form factor , models such as the one used here have the property that @xmath77 as @xmath37 if @xmath78 . for a model @xmath0 meson ,",
    "the differing feature is the presence of an overall spin index and some momentum - independent clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "we therefore expect that , as for the case of the pion form factor  @xcite , @xmath79 ( perhaps dependent upon @xmath80 ) as @xmath37 for @xmath78 and any @xmath81 .",
    "on the other hand , power counting rules of perturbative qcd  @xcite predict that the matrix element @xmath82 dominates as @xmath37 , and that @xmath83 is suppressed by on power of @xmath84 and @xmath85 by two powers of @xmath84 .",
    "thus , a constituent quark model with one - body currents only can not reproduce the asymptotic limit .    while simple models may fail to describe the asymptotic limit appropriate for perturbative qcd",
    ", we note that the rotational covariance condition takes a simple form at very high @xmath4 . in the @xmath37 limit of eq .",
    "( [ bbb ] ) , @xmath85 drops out due to power suppression .",
    "the remaining terms give @xmath86 the breit frame @xmath87 matrix element of the transverse current in a helicity basis is identically zero  @xcite .",
    "the light - front matrix element @xmath88 is not identically zero , but is suppressed by two powers of @xmath84 relative to a specific combination of @xmath82 and @xmath89 .",
    "note also that , in eq .",
    "( [ bbf ] ) , the factors of @xmath75 which correspond to the dynamical nature of the rotational covariance condition are now very large . at the same time , the gluon - exchange terms used to derive the power - counting helicity rules in perturbative qcd correspond to two - body currents in a constituent model such as that presented here . at high @xmath4 , therefore , the @xmath75 factors , the dynamics of perturbative qcd and rotational covariance are linked in a way which can not be described in a constituent model with one - body currents .",

    ", the fact that its structure is essentially nonrelativistic ( all masses are large compared to the momentum scale of the system ) suggests that the rotational covariance requirement can be satisfied in a satisfactory quantitative way using only one - body current matrix elements . for hadrons composed of quarks ,",
    "typical quark masses are not small compared to typical momentum scales , and issue of rotational covariance therefore must be studied separately . in this paper , we have investigated the behavior of current matrix elements in a simple model of a @xmath0  meson .",
    "our results using variable input parameters indicate a breakdown of rotational covariance of current matrix elements when @xmath72 is of order unity . the dynamical nature of the rotational covariance constraint is reflected in the presence of the interacting mass eigenvalue of the composite particle . in addition , rotational covariance implies a specific power - law relation among the spin matrix elements at high @xmath4 . that relation is consistent with the power - counting rules of perturbative qcd , which in turn are derived from gluon - exchange contributions that correspond to two - body currents in a constituent - quark framework .",
