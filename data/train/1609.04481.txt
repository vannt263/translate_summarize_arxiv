    "let @xmath5 be an @xmath6-dimensional subordinator , and @xmath7 be another @xmath6-dimensional lvy process called the subordinate .",
    "subordination is the operation that produces the @xmath6-dimensional process @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "the subordination of lvy processes has important applications in mathematical finance , and acts as a time change that models the flow of information , measuring time in volume of trade as opposed to real time .",
    "this idea was initiated by madan and seneta  @xcite who introduced the variance gamma ( @xmath11 ) process for modelling stock prices , where the subordinate is brownian motion and the subordinator is a gamma process .    multivariate subordination can be applied to model dependence across multivariate lvy processes , where the components may have common and/or idiosyncratic time changes . however , one drawback is that the subordinated process may not be a lvy process .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are _ independent _ , then there are two important special cases where @xmath8 is again a lvy process .",
    "firstly , if @xmath12 are _ indistinguishable _  ( rogozin  @xcite , zolotarev  @xcite , sato  @xcite , barndorff - nielsen and shiryaev  @xcite ) , and secondly , if @xmath3 has _ independent components _ @xmath13  ( barndorff - nielsen , pedersen and sato  @xcite ) . thus , when dealing with strictly multivariate subordination , we have to restrict the class of admissible subordinates @xmath3 to lvy processes with _ independent components _ , which is in some cases necessary if we are to stay in the class of lvy processes .",
    "we refer the reader to buchmann , kaehler , maller and szimayer  @xcite for a thorough discussion of traditional subordination .",
    "we show that there exists an operation that extends the traditional notion of subordination by assigning the distribution of a lvy process @xmath1 to the pair @xmath0 of lvy processes .",
    "the weakly subordinated process @xmath1 is a general lvy process , it inherits jumps from the multivariate subordinator @xmath2 , which resembles subordination , and our new operation reduces to subordination when the components of @xmath3 are independent or indistinguishable .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organised as follows .",
    "section  [ secmainresult ] contains our main results .",
    "we define weak subordination , show its existence and that there is a stronger pathwise interpretation , based on marked point processes of jumps , which we call semi - strong subordination .",
    "section  [ secprop ] contains a number of results concerned with the relation between traditional subordination and weak subordination .",
    "in particular , we show that weak subordination extends traditional subordination and is consistent with projecting to marginal distributions , like traditional subordination . however , there are also differences between both notions .",
    "to highlight those , we provide formulae for the first and second moments and covariances for general weakly subordinated processes .",
    "sections  [ secvalphagamma ] and  [ secvggc ] contain applications . in section  [ secvalphagamma ] ,",
    "we illustrate how weak subordination can be used to model multiple asset prices .",
    "the traditional multivariate @xmath11-process in  @xcite uses @xmath6-dimensional brownian motion as its subordinate and a univariate gamma process as its subordinator , which gives it a restrictive dependence structure , where components can not have idiosyncratic time changes and must have equal kurtosis .",
    "these last two deficiencies have been addressed by luciano and semeraro s  @xcite variance-@xmath4-gamma-(@xmath14)-process by the use of a @xmath4-gamma subordinator .",
    "however , the brownian motion subordinate must have _ independent _ components , which also restricts the dependence structure that such processes can model . in our _ weak formulation _ of the @xmath14-process , the subordinate is a brownian motion with possibly _",
    "correlated components_. our weak @xmath14-process has a wider range of dependence structures , while being parsimoniously parametrised , each component has both common and idiosyncratic time changes , it has @xmath11 marginals with independent levels of kurtosis , and the jump measure has full support .",
    "we outline some useful formulas , fit both the weak and strong @xmath14-processes to a s&p500-ftse100 data set and show that the weak model has a significantly better fit .    in section  [ secvggc ] ,",
    "we exemplify the unifying nature of weak subordination as illustrated using ( variance ) generalised gamma convolutions .",
