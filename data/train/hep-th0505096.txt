    "the most intriguing aspect of gravity is that of holography .",
    "it was t hooft @xcite who first observed that the true degrees of freedom in space are on the boundary and not in the volume as naively expected .",
    "more precisely , it was shown that a system with gravity should be describable by a quantum theory in one less dimension .",
    "subsequent developments by susskind @xcite worked out more consequences of this dimensional reduction , or the more fashionable name ` holography ' , and maldacena @xcite conjectured this may be demonstrated in string theory based on an explicit construction in anti - desitter space .",
    "this is not the first time that a vast reduction from the expected degrees of freedom has been discovered . in their seminal article on string thermodynamics , atick and witten",
    "@xcite found that a 10- or 26-dimensional string theory at high temperature behaved more like a 2-dimensional field theory . in their speculation on why this might occur they comment :    it is in this spirit that we attempt to model the holographic ` thinning of degrees of freedom ' via a modified commutator . in this modification ,",
    "the size of the quanta will now depend on the energy scale .",
    "the idea of modified commutators is not new @xcite @xcite , and has recently been employed by kempf @xcite to describe string - like minimal distances in quantum field theory .",
    "we use a similar ansatz in that we replace the spatial momentum basis @xmath0 with a more fundamental @xmath1-basis on which the momenta depend . an ansatz consistent with galilean invariance is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is some function of the radial parameter @xmath4 .",
    "in this basis the position operator becomes @xmath5 .",
    "then the commutator is @xmath6 = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial p^j}{\\partial \\rho^i } = i \\hbar \\left (   f ( \\rho ) \\delta^{ij } + 2 \\frac{\\partial f ( \\rho)}{\\partial \\rho^2 } \\rho^i \\rho^j \\right ) .\\ ] ] when @xmath7 , the usual commutator is recovered .",
    "we stress that we have no reason for believing the commutator truly obeys this relation at a fundamental level ; rather , we expect this may be some effective description which can be easily implemented to exhibit gravity - like behavior and in particular holography in _ any _ physical system , without the need for elaborate constructions .",
    "to see how this might come about , we will consider the simplest possible example based on dimensional analysis of black holes . in usual quantum mechanics , @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath9 is now the fourier conjugate of position , we can interpret this to mean @xmath10 , which is indeed the case : larger momenta probes smaller distance . but trying to probe ultrashort distances with @xmath11 will be unsuccessful , since this will instead produce a black hole of size @xmath12 . in our formalism",
    "this would be represented as @xmath13 .",
    "these two behaviors are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the simplest way to combine these behaviors is to use the relation    , there exist dual descriptions of the same underlying physics . in particular",
    ", a cutoff @xmath14 implies a uv cutoff in quantum mechanics @xmath15 as well as an ir cutoff in gravity @xmath16 . ]     + , there exist dual descriptions of the same underlying physics .",
    "in particular , a cutoff @xmath14 implies a uv cutoff in quantum mechanics @xmath15 as well as an ir cutoff in gravity @xmath16 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]     +    @xmath17 this can be inverted to give @xmath18 as a function of @xmath9 , @xmath19 these solutions are shown in figure 2 . at large distance ( small @xmath9 )",
    "the negative solution contains the usual quantum behavior @xmath20 , and the positive solution contains the gravitational behavior @xmath21 . to determine the precise commutator , we solve for @xmath3 : @xmath22",
    "note that the solution requires @xmath23 , implying a minimal distance @xmath24 at a momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the solution studied by kempf also contains a short - distance cutoff , but ours is significantly different in that our minimal length can be reached at finite energy , and there is then a smooth transition to the new branch @xmath26 .",
    "since there are now two values of @xmath27 and @xmath18 for each @xmath9 there is an obvious double description : one as the low - energy  quantum mechanical \" description , the other the high - energy  gravity \" description .",
    "the mapping between the two is very simple : just choose the other @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the same @xmath9 .",
    "note we must choose precisely one of these two descriptions ; trying to use both descriptions simultaneously is redundant and contradictory , since our wavefunction can only depend on @xmath1 , not @xmath0 . in our example solution",
    "this duality is particularly simple to utilize , since it merely amounts to alternating between the two roots of a quadratic equation .",
    "this qm - gravity duality makes manifest the ir / uv correspondence emphasized by susskind and witten @xcite : a cutoff @xmath14 implies a uv cutoff in quantum mechanics @xmath15 and an ir cutoff in gravity @xmath30 .",
    "let us also make a comment regarding the most natural basis to use . consider how the number of states of a system changes when written in terms of @xmath9 and generalizing @xmath31 to be the determinant of the @xmath32 commutator matrix @xmath33 $ ] : @xmath34| } = v \\int \\frac { d^3 \\rho \\left| \\frac{\\partial p^i}{\\partial \\rho^j } \\right|}{(2 \\pi \\hbar)^3 \\left| \\frac{\\partial p^i}{\\partial \\rho^j } \\right| } = v \\int \\frac{d^3 \\rho } { ( 2 \\pi \\hbar)^3}.\\ ] ] the fact that the phase space is always ` flat ' when written in terms of @xmath1 , regardless of the specific form of @xmath3",
    ", suggests that it is @xmath1 and not @xmath0 that are the true degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "what happens when we insist on using the momentum basis",
    "? if we are on the quantum branch , the modifications to @xmath35 would show up as additional ` correction ' terms in the effective action .",
    "when we are in the gravity branch , the long - distance behavior is described by @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "_ thus a system of gravity has as many states as a qm system in 6 dimensions less : _",

    "dp}{(2 \\pi gp^2)^{3}}\\ ] ] @xmath40 the increase of quanta size at high energies gives an intuitive feel for why physics will prevent too many degrees of freedom in a region of space ; we propose that these ` fat quanta ' are in fact the basic constituents of black holes .",
    "susskind @xcite has emphasized that this type of quanta growth with momenta is essential to understanding holography . although the amount of dimensional reduction is much larger than that found in usual holography ( 6 dimensions reduced instead of just 1 ) we remind the reader we have used only the most simplistic dimensional analysis and a commutator in non - relativistic quantum mechanics ; we expect a more sophisticated treatment in gravity and quantum field theory to produce the correct amount of dimensional reduction .",
    "in this essay we have presented a novel method for studying gravity and holography .",
    "this method has the advantage that it can be implemented in any quantum system simply by changing the position - momentum commutator .",
    "theoretical and perhaps observational @xcite @xcite consequences could then be extracted .",
