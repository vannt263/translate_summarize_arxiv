    "directed current in ratchet systems have received much attention over recent years @xcite .",

    "a finite current @xmath9 , possessing an unbounded @xmath0-trajectory , is consequently independent of the initial condition @xmath10 .",
    "it can also be shown that a directed current ( @xmath11 ) is only possible if at least one of the following symmetries is broken @xcite : @xmath12 @xmath13    our main interest in this paper is to gain a deeper insight into these type of systems exploring some quantitative and qualitative aspects of its very rich dynamics . specifically , we will consider the same sawtooth potential as in refs .",

    "in addition , rather than using a sinusoidal driving force @xmath5 , in this work we will consider a multifrequency time - periodic force given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 being a constant . since the potential ( [ eq : uofx ] ) breaks the spatial symmetry ( [ eq : symm:1 ] ) , a directed current is possible , even though the time symmetry ( [ eq : symm:2 ] ) is fulfilled .",

    "furthermore , a simple explanation of the existence of such regions in the non - trivial regime @xmath39 would be desirable .",
    "let us assume that the particle starts at @xmath40 at the beginning of a driving period .",
    "it then moves under a force @xmath20 for half a period until it reaches the position @xmath41 .",
    "then the driving force switches sign so the total force on the particle is now @xmath21 , which makes it ( in general ) move backwards up to a position @xmath42 after another @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 , the particle has returned to the initial position , and consequently , the process is repeated successively , leading to a drift velocity strictly equal to zero .",

    "in addition , taking into account that @xmath59 is an even function , necessarily @xmath60 property ( [ eq : gofxsym:1 ] ) leads to the fact that we only need to vary @xmath40 within a spatial interval of length unity , whereas property ( [ eq : gofxsym:1 ] ) combined with ( [ eq : gofxsym:2 ] ) implies that @xmath38 has an inversion center at @xmath61 , with @xmath62 any integer .",
    "the driving period @xmath6 , when viewed as a function of @xmath53 or @xmath40 [ see eq .",

    "therefore , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) corresponds to particle localization . moving up the line",

    "[ fig : gofx ] is the one given by the pair @xmath69 .",
    "this pair marks the start of a second band that ends at the maximum value given by the pair @xmath70 . moving up the line up to a gives all the intermediate values in the band .",
    "clearly , the first band is associated with movement within a spatial interval less than unity ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) , whereas the second band is related to displacements two times that distance ( @xmath72 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : velofw:2 ] we have indicated with arrows the calculated frequency bands .",
    "it can be seen that they do not cover the entire region with numerically evaluated zero velocity .",
    "this is due to the fact that the above discussed mechanism is just the simplest one leading to zero current .",
    "the drift velocity can also vanish because the particle returns to its initial position after two or more driving periods , instead of after the first one .",

    "@xmath38 presents singularities at the equilibrium points , which prevents the particle from crossing those points when @xmath74 .",

    "@xmath98 $ ] , let us assume that the particle is initially located at a minimum of the potential @xmath101 ( as we have mentioned before , the drift velocity does not depend on this particular initial condition ) .",
    "if we choose the time period of @xmath5 as @xmath102 , with @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , then , during the first half - period , @xmath107 , the particle stays trapped at the initial location .",
