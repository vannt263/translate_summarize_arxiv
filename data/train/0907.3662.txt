    "we use a similar argument to show that @xmath210 is not @xmath224defective : let us consider the configuration @xmath225 composed of @xmath212 leaning on two layers , one of type @xmath226 , below which we put a @xmath205 as the one in figure [ d10 ] . since @xmath212 and @xmath205 are disjoint polytopes , we apply again proposition [ prop ] to this configuration , using lemma [ base10 ] , thus we get that @xmath210 is not @xmath227defective .",
    "now we want to extend the non @xmath3defectivity of @xmath210 to any @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath228 we apply lemma [ reduce ] ; let us now consider @xmath229 , we call @xmath230 the general tangent space to @xmath231 , and @xmath232 the tangent space to @xmath229 at some general point . looking at the polytopes which compose @xmath225 , we see that two vertices stay out of the configuration ( one pointed out in @xmath212 , the other one in @xmath205 ) ; indeed @xmath233 . hence @xmath234 . again by terracini s lemma we get that @xmath235 , with @xmath32 a general point on @xmath210 . then @xmath236",
    "; if it were not , then @xmath232 would be a hyperplane in @xmath237 ; let @xmath238 be the projection from @xmath230 in @xmath237 onto @xmath239 .",
    "since @xmath240 , its projection is a point .",
    "but @xmath241 is exactly the general tangent space to the projection of @xmath210 , which must be a point .",
    "hence @xmath210 would be degenerate , which is a contradiction .",
    "with this argument we get that @xmath242 is not @xmath3defective for any @xmath243 .          _ proof .",
    "_ let us look at figure [ d12 ] ; it is a composition of layers of type @xmath226 , @xmath205 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "we place over the four layers represented , a configuration of type @xmath212 , as in corollary [ cor8 - 10 ] .",
    "we call this new configuration @xmath247 ; we are going to show that @xmath244 is not @xmath248defective using the strategy of lemma [ v6 ] .",
    "looking at the @xmath249 colored tetrahedra in @xmath247 ( counting also the ones in @xmath250 ) , most of them correspond to tangent @xmath24 s , as in lemma [ tetraedro_tg ] , but @xmath146 of them are not tangent @xmath24 s , so we want to think of them as limits of general tangent @xmath24 s . if we denote by @xmath251 the mentioned tetrahedra , we see that some of them lie inside unitary cubes , but we find three tetrahedra , one lying in @xmath252 ( @xmath253 , moreover see lemma [ v6 ] ) , one in @xmath205 , the other one in @xmath245 , which sit inside blocks @xmath114 as in figure [ blocco ] .",
    "let us call them @xmath167 , @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "for all the tetrahedra @xmath251 we can reapply the techniques used in lemma [ v6 ] , i.e. one by one we compose the degenerations of general tangent @xmath24 s to the limit @xmath24 s defined by the relative @xmath256 s , @xmath257 .",
    "of course we will apply the construction of case ii to @xmath258 and @xmath255 , and the construction of case i to @xmath259 . at the end of the process ,",
    "composing all the degenerations , we obtain @xmath247 as our limit configuration .",
    "finally we observe that , since the @xmath249 limit @xmath24 s span a projective space of dimension @xmath260 , hence , by semicontinuity of the dimension we get a lower bound on @xmath261 , and we can conclude that @xmath244 is not @xmath248defective .",
    "but we are interested in the @xmath3defectivity of @xmath244 for any @xmath25 .",
    "so , we are going to study @xmath262 .",
    "let us notice that in the configuration @xmath247 three points are not contained in any of the pointed out tetrahedra .",
    "however they are very close to each other , so we can think of the three points as being contained in a further tetrahedron in @xmath247 .",
    "having in mind a configuration with @xmath263 disjoint tetrahedra , we can repeat the argument we used before . then again by semicontinuity we obtain that @xmath262 spans the whole ambient space .",
    "it follows that @xmath244 is not @xmath3defective for any @xmath264 , hence for any @xmath3 ( see lemma [ reduce ] ) .",
    "so far we have shown that @xmath23 is not @xmath3defective for @xmath155 and any @xmath25 . in the following",
    "we will study the cases @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 , which we will handle using recurrence on the configurations we have already built .",
    "we start by examining the case @xmath268 . when @xmath269 , the tetrahedron @xmath270 ( see lemma [ degeneration1 ] ) can be split up into one @xmath213 , that we triangulate following figure [ d6 ] , and one layer @xmath271 of height @xmath272 and big base of side length @xmath273",
    ". we can furthermore divide @xmath271 in two triangulated tetrahedra @xmath213 lying in its ends , and a block @xmath274 , as illustrated in figure [ d=14 ] .",
    "we can triangulate @xmath274 as follows : one semicube @xmath275 of side length @xmath272 , plus one tetrahedron of side length @xmath159 , that we denote by @xmath276 , and one tetrahedron of side length @xmath277 , @xmath278 .",
    "none of @xmath276 and @xmath278 is a @xmath0-simplex , but we can think of them as the configurations of @xmath145 and @xmath156 respectively ( the subdivision of @xmath274 is represented in figure [ base - d=14 ] ) .",
    "recall that @xmath145 and @xmath156 are respectively not @xmath146defective and @xmath157defective . in figure [ proiez.semicubo-d=14](a )",
    "we have represented the orthogonal projection of the semicube @xmath275 , which shows that it contains @xmath277 disjoint columns of height @xmath272 , each containing @xmath163 pairwise disjoint unitary cubes , and every cube is not @xmath101defective ; the squares in figure [ proiez.semicubo-d=14](a ) are precisely the projections of the columns .",
    "the yellow triangles correspond to the projections of some different columns of height @xmath272 , that we denote by @xmath279 , each containing @xmath277 pairwise disjoint tetrahedra , as in figure [ proiez.semicubo-d=14](b ) . if we consider the toric variety defined by @xmath279 , it is a @xmath280 embedded in @xmath281 via @xmath282 , where @xmath283 are the projections on the factors ; we see that it is not @xmath159defective .",
    "to show this , we will use the techniques of lemma [ v6 ] .",
    "we want to prove that the @xmath277 tetrahedra that we pointed out in @xmath279 correspond to limits of general tangent @xmath24 s .",
    "four of them are not of the type introduced in lemma [ tetraedro_tg ] ; let us denote them by @xmath192 ; every @xmath256 lies inside a semicube , which corresponds to @xmath280 and spans a @xmath284 . so in order to use the argument of lemma [ v6 ] we just have to pay attention to the ambient space .",
    "an easy calculation such as in lemma [ v6 ] yields that @xmath192 are limits of general tangent @xmath24 s hence figure [ proiez.semicubo-d=14](b ) is our limit configuration .",
    "notice that the tetrahedra corresponding to the limit @xmath24 s are pairwise disjoint , then they span a projective space of dimension @xmath285 .",
    "hence , by semicontinuity we can conclude that the toric variety defined by @xmath279 is not @xmath159defective .",
    "going back to @xmath275 , since it is composed of @xmath163 columns @xmath279 plus @xmath286 unitary cubes and all these polytopes are pairwise disjoint , applying proposition [ prop ] we get that the toric variety associated to @xmath275 is not @xmath287defective .",
    "recalling that above @xmath288 lies a @xmath213 , which represents a @xmath156 , and that in our configuration ( see figure [ d=14 ] ) we have disjoint polytopes , then we can apply proposition [ prop ] and obtain that @xmath289 is not @xmath290defective ( where @xmath291 ) .    in order to study the generic case @xmath268",
    ", we look at the tetrahedron @xmath292 ; we proceed by recurrence .",
    "suppose we already know that @xmath293 is not @xmath294defective .",
    "we build a configuration of @xmath295 in the following way : we set a layer of height @xmath272 with base of side length @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath296 , below @xmath297 , whose configuration we already know by induction ; now we subdivide @xmath296 as follows : first we note that if @xmath268 , then @xmath296 contains @xmath298 cubes of side length @xmath272 ( @xmath299 ) . in @xmath299",
    "we insert @xmath300 disjoint columns of height @xmath272 , each containing @xmath163 disjoint unitary cubes , which , in turn , are not @xmath101defective , as shown in lemma [ observations ] .",
    "hence , being @xmath301 , we get that @xmath299 is not @xmath302defective .",
    "moreover , @xmath296 contains @xmath3 semicubes equal to @xmath275 , that we triangulated before , and finally , on the skew stripe located in the front we set @xmath4 copies of @xmath213 , @xmath3 copies of @xmath276 and @xmath3 ones of @xmath278 , as in figure [ d=22 ] , which represents the orthogonal projection of @xmath303 . we summarize our construction in the following computation : @xmath304        hence , recalling the defectivity of the toric varieties associated to the polytopes composing @xmath99 , we observe that @xmath305 now , noticing that the polytopes involved are all disjoint , we can apply proposition [ prop ] , and we get that @xmath306 is not @xmath307defective .",
    "the problem is now to find a configuration for @xmath313 : we insert a prism having triangular basis of side length @xmath314 and height @xmath272 , denoted @xmath315 ; it can be viewed as the half of a parallelepiped of height @xmath272 having square basis of side @xmath314 , called @xmath316 ; then , on the skew stripe in the front we put two tetrahedra @xmath213 and a block @xmath317 composed of a @xmath278 plus a cut tetrahedron of side @xmath272 which we denote @xmath318 , as it is shown in figure [ d=16 ] .",
    "we can obtain @xmath319 setting a @xmath320 on a layer @xmath191 , in turn lying on a @xmath211 , from which we remove the black prism as shown in figure [ taglio7](a ) .",
    "we want to show that @xmath319 is not @xmath321defective .",
    "notice that @xmath320 is not @xmath146defective ; we focus on the cut @xmath211 , which is disjoint from @xmath320 .",
    "let us consider the configuration in figure [ taglio7](b ) .",
    "we see that @xmath322 tetrahedra correspond to the ones introduced in lemma [ tetraedro_tg ] , i.e. they are tangent @xmath24 s .",
    "but there are @xmath163 tetrahedra adjacent to the cut , which do not correspond to tangent @xmath24 s .",
    "each of them lies inside a semicube , so we apply the argument of lemmas [ v6 ] and [ lemma12 ] , that we also saw for the column @xmath279 , and we get that the tetrahedra inside @xmath211 can be interpreted as limits of tangent @xmath24 s .",
    "being disjoint , they span a projective space of dimension @xmath323 , hence the cut layer @xmath211 is not @xmath146defective ( again with abuse of notation ) .",
    "the block @xmath317 is not @xmath324defective . summing up , by proposition [ prop ] we get that @xmath325 is not @xmath326defective . in the general case , when @xmath308 , we consider the parallelepiped @xmath316 , from which we remove a vertical edge of height @xmath272 : in this way we obtain a prism , @xmath327 , that we can see in figure [ h9 ] , and that contains @xmath328 disjoint unitary cubes plus one column @xmath279 .",
    "so @xmath327 is not @xmath329defective . just like before we denote by @xmath275 the half of a cube @xmath299 ; @xmath275 is not @xmath287defective .",
    "we are now able to split @xmath99 into @xmath297 , and a @xmath330 . in this layer",
    "we insert ( see figure [ d=40 ] ) in diagonal order : one @xmath327 ; @xmath163 copies of @xmath275 ; then we have @xmath331 ; @xmath3 copies of @xmath275 ; in the front we put @xmath11 copies of @xmath213 , @xmath332 copies of the block @xmath333 , and finally one block @xmath317 .",

    "let us observe that the tetrahedra lying in @xmath345 are @xmath348 .    repeating the argument used for @xmath319",

    "let us show the configuration of this block : for @xmath358 , the block @xmath359 contains @xmath360 disjoint columns of height @xmath272 and square basis of side @xmath101 , and @xmath5 columns @xmath279 , hence it is not @xmath361defective .",
    "the orthogonal projections of these columns can be viewed in figure [ taglio9](b ) . for @xmath143",
