    "an important issue in general relativity is to ascertain whether a given matter distribution will collapse to form a black hole . to address one aspect of this question we shall consider a minimally coupled massive scalar field with spherical symmetry which starts from rest .",
    "massive scalar fields are important in many models of the early universe .",
    "if any of these fields underwent gravitational collapse then the result would be a primordial black hole .    in recent years ,",
    "gravitational collapse with massless scalar fields and spherical symmetry has been analysed in some detail @xcite .",
    "one result to come out of this is that , when the initial profile of the scalar field is fixed in terms of a single parameter , there is a critical parameter value . beyond the critical value a black hole will form@xcite .",
    "much less is known about the spherically symmetric collapse of massive scalar fields . in order to obtain an approximate solution of the einstein equations we introduce a wkb approximation for the field in the limit where the mass of the scalar field is large . to leading order",
    ", the solution behaves in the same way as inhomogeneous dust .",
    "this is known already for the linearised einstein equations , but we find that the wkb approximation is equally good in the non - linear regime .    the dust solution , like the oppenheimer - snyder@xcite solution , always collapses to a black hole . by keeping track of the size of the terms that are higher order in the approximation",
    "we obtain a sufficient condition for the validity of the approximation and therefore for the gravitational collapse of the massive scalar field .",
    "this condition can be obtained analytically when the initial density has a top - hat form , and numerically otherwise .",
    "planck units ( in which @xmath0 ) are used throughout .",
    "the most general spherically symmetric spacetime metric can be written in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the metric of a unit 2-sphere .",
    "it is convenient , for our purposes , to rescale the coordinate @xmath6 to the proper time @xmath7 of a comoving observer at radial coordinate @xmath8 , @xmath9 hence one gets the metric in gaussian coordinates , @xmath10    the einstein tensor components are @xmath11 \\\\",

    ", we will take a real minimally coupled scalar field of mass @xmath14 , whose equation of motion is @xmath15 in the spherically symmetric metric , @xmath16 the stress - energy tensor of the scalar field has components @xmath17    it proves convenient to introduce the functions @xmath18 so that two einstein equations can be recast in terms of the first derivatives of these two functions , @xmath19 these two equations , together with the scalar equation ( [ sdot ] ) , form a complete set .",
    "a third einstein equation provides a constraint @xmath20 which is important for relating @xmath21 to the initial data .",
    "the equations have an approximate solution when the compton wavelength of the field @xmath22 is much smaller than the radius @xmath23 of the spherical region where the field is non - vanishing , @xmath24 the scalar field has a wave - like solution with nearly constant amplitude , @xmath25 the stress - energy tensor becomes @xmath26\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the form of the stress - energy tensor suggests a trigonometric expansion for the function @xmath27 of the form @xmath28 with similar expansions for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "more precisely , we take @xmath31 terms which play no role have been dropped .    when the expansions are substituted into eqs .",
    "( [ mdef][mdot ] ) the leading order terms give @xmath32 the first three equations also arise in the tolman ",
    "bondi solution representing the collapse of spherically symmetric dust .",
    "we deduce that to leading order the metric will have tolman  bondi form .",
    "the next order gives @xmath33 we will assume that the wkb approximation holds as long as these correction terms are less than @xmath34 the leading terms .",
    "( the effect of changing this number will be equivalent to changing the value of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the largest correction comes from the @xmath35 term , therefore the wkb approximation should be valid whilst @xmath36 this inequality defines a region of the @xmath37 coordinate plane .",
    "the region is bounded by a curve where the inequality is saturated , @xmath38 there is no reason to extend the leading order approximation beyond this curve .",
    "therefore the region of validity of the approximation will only consist of points in whose causal past the inequality is always satisfied .",
    "we have seen that a sufficiently massive scalar field behaves like inhomogeneous dust .",
    "the corresponding metric can be recovered from the definitions ( [ kdef ] ) and ( [ mdef ] ) , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( dropping the ` 0'-indices for simplicity ) , @xmath41 the metric has tolman  bondi form @xcite .",
    "this is a well known class of solutions that can be thought of as a collection of free  falling spherical shells . assuming @xmath42 ( then none of the shells cross )",
    ", one can analytically integrate equation ( [ rdt ] ) parametrically @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an arbitrary function .",
    "we take time - symmetric initial data with @xmath45 these initial conditions fix the radial coordinate @xmath8 and the functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 runs from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "a particular solution is uniquely specified by @xmath52 and related to the initial density profile @xmath53 , @xmath54 the function @xmath52 is the total mass within the sphere of radius @xmath8 .",
    "if it approaches a constant value @xmath55 at large radius then @xmath55 is the adm mass .",
    "a model for the initial density profile which we make use of later is @xmath56 so that the mass function is simply , @xmath57 this mass distribution collapses to form a black hole of radius @xmath58 .",
    "the centre collapses first , and forms a singularity after a proper - time @xmath59 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig1 ]    also shown in figure [ fig1 ] is the event horizon , obtained by solving the equation for radial null geodesics @xmath60 r^{-1}\\label{rng}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 with the boundary condition @xmath62 as @xmath63 .",
    "various derivatives of the radial function that are of use are @xmath64 the value of @xmath27 given by eq .",
    "( [ phie ] ) will diverge if @xmath65 , from which we obtain a restriction on the initial mass distribution : @xmath66 .",
    "oppenheimer and snyder considered the collapse of a star with constant density , for which @xmath67 in this case the model can be solved explicitly and we can obtain analytic expressions for the domain of validity of the wkb approximation .",
    "we are especially interested in those cases where the domain of validity covers the whole region outside the event horizon .",
    "a constant scalar field gives a constant density but the discontinuity at @xmath68 causes the wkb approximation to break down .",
    "it is possible to change the form of the field close to the edge to make the field continuous and still have constant density , @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the wkb approximation breaks down along the curve given by equation ( [ wkb ] ) .",
    "let @xmath72 parameterise this curve , then from eqs .",
    "( [ rd ] ) and ( [ rprime ] ) , @xmath73 therefore @xmath72 is constant for @xmath74 . in this case",
    "@xmath75 is also constant .",
    "the tolman - bondi solution is exact for @xmath76 , therefore the wkb approximation breaks down along a line segment from @xmath77 to @xmath68 with fixed time coordinate @xmath78 .",
    "if this line segment lies inside the event horizon of the tolman ",
    "bondi metric then the wkb approximation must be valid outside of the event horizon .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the event horizon is given by a curve @xmath79 .",
    "outside of the matter distribution the event horizon lies along @xmath80 , therefore @xmath81 now , the end of the line where the wkb approximation breaks down will lie inside the event horizon when @xmath82 which is when @xmath83 now , from equation ( [ etas ] ) we have @xmath84 the condition that the wkb approximation breaks down inside the event horizon is therefore @xmath85 if this inequality is satisfied , then the scalar field configuration with adm mass @xmath55 which is initially constant for @xmath74 will collapse to form a black hole .",
    "the arguments presented here say nothing about what happens when the inequality is not satisfied .",
    "the inequality approaches @xmath86 when @xmath23 is much larger than the initial schwarzschild radius .",
    "for more complicated density distributions it becomes necessary to test the validity of the wkb approximation numerically .",
    "we will concentrate here on the exponential density distribution ( [ exp ] ) given earlier and compare this to the results for the top - hat distribution of the oppenheimer ",
    "snyder limit .",
    "the aim , as before , is to locate the parameter ranges for which a black hole forms because the wkb approximation holds good everywhere outside of the event horizon .",
    "the method we use is to find the curve on which the wkb approximation breaks down and find conditions which place this curve wholly inside the event horizon .",
    "differentiating eq .",
    "( [ wkb ] ) gives an equation for @xmath72 , @xmath87 { { \\rm d}\\eta_*\\over{\\rm d } r } = \\beta ' -{1\\over2}\\gamma ' ( \\eta _ * + \\sin \\eta_*)\\ ] ] with @xmath88 , given by eq .",
    "( [ etas ] ) and @xmath89 this equation can be solved numerically using a simple runge - kutta method .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "when the shape of initial field configuration is fixed , the model is parameterised by the scalar field mass @xmath14 , the length scale @xmath23 and the total mass @xmath55 .",
    "the method used here only depends on the combinations @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the numerical results for two density distributions are shown in figure [ fig3 ] . above the lines ,",
    "the wkb approximation is valid outside of the event horizon and a black hole will form .",
    "this condition is sufficient but not necessary .",
    "the numerical results for the openheimer ",
    "snyder limit agree with the analytical result to six significant figures on the majority of data points .",
    "we have analysed in some detail the regime in which a spherically symmetric massive scalar field can be treated as if it where dust . the result is a criterion for the formation of black holes depending on size and mass scales .",
    "the criterion depends to some extent on the form of the density distribution .    outside of the wkb regime",
    "the solution of the einstein equations is a more difficult problem .",
    "the most studied case is the massless limit , where echoing behaviour was discovered at the point which separates the cases which form black holes from those which do not .",
    "this point lies on the horizontal axis in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is quite possible that the line which bounds black hole formation continues up from this point .",
    "it certainly must lie under the lines shown in the figure .    in some inflationary models of the early universe ,",
    "the end of the inflationary phase is followed by a period dominated by the energy of a massive scalar field @xcite .",
    "it has been mentioned before that the matter content of the universe behaves like dust during this period , leading to a situation in which density fluctuations grow and could form primordial black holes@xcite .",
    "the length of time for which the massive scalar field dominates is limited by the decay of the field into radiation .",
    "the tolman ",
    "bondi models can be used to predict how much time is necessary for the collapse to a black hole . in an einstein  de sitter universe of density @xmath92 , a region of dust with density @xmath93 collapses to a singularity in a time @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the volume average of @xmath96 . if the wkb approximation is valid then a black hole will form only if the scalar field has not decayed during the time @xmath97 .",
    "the results obtained here for the validity of the wkb approximation have been limited to asymptotically flat spacetimes and time symmetric initial data but they can be adapted to remove these limitations for applications to cosmology .",
    "we expect there to be little change to the results if the length scale @xmath23 is smaller than the horizon size @xmath98 .",
    "we have a simple condition for validity of the wkb approximation in the oppenheimer  snyder limit , @xmath99 . in the early universe , the mass within the scale @xmath23 is given by @xmath100",
    ". the scalar field will behave like dust provided that @xmath101 .",
    "if we take @xmath102 , then the condition becomes @xmath103 , which means that the wkb approximation is valid up to the formation of the event horizon if it is valid initially .",
