    "in the last years the study of variational questions in sub - riemannian geometry has received an increasing interest . in particular ,",
    "the desire to achieve a better understanding of global variational questions involving the area , such as the _ plateau problem _ or the _ isoperimetric problem _ , has motivated the recent development of a theory of _ constant mean curvature surfaces _ in the _ heisenberg group _ @xmath0 endowed with its _ carnot - carathodory distance_.    it is well - known that constant mean curvature surfaces arise as critical points of the area for variations preserving the volume enclosed by the surface . in this paper , we are interested in surfaces immersed in the heisenberg group which are _ stationary points _ of the sub - riemannian area , with or without a _ volume constraint_. in order to precise the situation and state our results we recall some facts about the heisenberg group , that will be treated in more detail in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the @xmath3-dimensional _ heisenberg group _ , which we identify with the lie group @xmath4 , where the product is given by @xmath5*[z',t']=[z+z',t+t'+\\text{im}\\big(z\\overline{z}'\\big)].\\ ] ] the lie algebra of @xmath0",
    "is generated by three left invariant vector fields @xmath6 with one non - trivial bracket relation given by @xmath7=-2t$ ] .",
    "the @xmath8-dimensional distribution generated by @xmath9 is called the _ horizontal distribution _ in @xmath0 .",
    "usually @xmath0 is endowed with a structure of sub - riemannian manifold by considering the riemannian metric on the horizontal distribution so that the basis @xmath9 is orthonormal .",
    "this metric allows to measure the length of horizontal curves and to define the _ carnot - carathodory distance _ between two points as the infimum of length of horizontal curves joining both points , see @xcite .",
    "it is known that the carnot - carathdory distance can be approximated by the distance functions associated to a family of dilated riemannian metrics , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg group @xmath0 is also a pseudo - hermitian manifold .",
    "it is the simplest one and can be seen as a blow - up of general pseudo - hermitian manifolds ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 is also a _ carnot group _ since its lie algebra is stratified and @xmath8-nilpotent , see @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0 is a group one can consider its haar measure , which turns out to coincide with the lebesgue measure in @xmath10 . from the notions of distance and measure",
    "one can also define the minkowski content and the sub - riemannian perimeter of a set , and the spherical hausdorff measure of a surface , so that different surface measures may be given on @xmath0 . as it is shown in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "all these notions of `` area '' coincide for a @xmath1 surface .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the notions of volume and area in @xmath0 as follows .",
    "we consider the left invariant riemannian metric @xmath11 on @xmath0 so that @xmath6 is an orthonormal basis at every point .",
    "we define the volume @xmath12 of a borel set @xmath13 as the riemannian measure of the set .",
    "the area of an immersed @xmath14 surface @xmath15 in @xmath0 is defined as the integral @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a unit vector normal to the surface , @xmath18 denotes the orthogonal projection onto the horizontal distribution , and @xmath19 is the riemannian area element induced on @xmath15 by the metric @xmath20 .",
    "this definition of area agrees for @xmath1 surfaces with the ones mentioned above .    with these notions of volume and area",
    ", we study in section  [ sec : meancurvature ] surfaces in @xmath0 which are _ stationary _ points of the area either for arbitrary variations , or for variations preserving the volume enclosed by the surface . as in riemannian geometry",
    ", one may expect that some geometric quantity defined on such a surface vanishes or remains constant . by using the first variation of area in lemma  [ lem : dp / dt ]",
    "we will see that any @xmath1 area - stationary surface under a volume constraint must have _ constant mean curvature_. the mean curvature @xmath21 of a surface @xmath15 is defined in as the riemannian divergence relative to @xmath15 of the _ horizontal unit normal vector _ to @xmath15 given by @xmath22 .",
    "we remark that a notion of mean curvature in @xmath0 for graphs over the @xmath2-plane was previously introduced by s.  pauls @xcite . a more general definition of mean curvature has been proposed by j .-",
    "cheng , j .- f .",
    "hwang , a.  malchiodi and p.  yang @xcite , and by n.  garofalo and s.  pauls @xcite .",
    "as was shown in @xcite our definition agrees with all the previous ones .    the analysis of the _ singular set _ plays an important role in the study of area - stationary surfaces in @xmath0 . given a surface @xmath15 immersed in @xmath0 ,",
    "the singular set @xmath23 of @xmath15 is the set of points where @xmath15 is tangent to the horizontal distribution .",
    "its structure has been determined for surfaces with bounded mean curvature in @xcite , where it is proved that @xmath24 consists of isolated points and @xmath14 curves , see theorem [ th : chmy ] for a more detailed description .",
    "regular part _",
    "@xmath25 of @xmath15 is foliated by horizontal curves called the _",
    "characteristic curves_. as is pointed out in @xcite , when the surface @xmath15 has constant mean curvature @xmath21 , any of these curves is part of a _ geodesic _ in @xmath0 of curvature @xmath21 . in particular , any surface in @xmath0 with @xmath26 is foliated , up to the singular set , by horizontal straight lines .",
    "the recent study of surfaces with constant mean curvature in @xmath0 has mainly focused on minimal surfaces ( those with @xmath26 ) .",
    "in fact , many interesting questions of the classical theory of minimal surfaces in @xmath10 , such as the plateau problem , the bernstein problem , or the global behavior of properly embedded surfaces , have been treated in @xmath0 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these works also provide a rich variety of examples of minimal surfaces .",
    "however , in spite of the last advances , very little is known about non - minimal constant mean curvature surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to check that a graph @xmath27 of class @xmath1 in @xmath0 with constant mean curvature @xmath21 satisfies the following degenerate ( elliptic and hyperbolic ) pde @xmath28 in @xcite some relevant properties concerning the above equation , such as the uniqueness of solutions for the dirichlet problem or the structure of the singular set , are studied . as to the examples ,",
    "the only known complete surfaces with non - vanishing constant mean curvature are the compact spherical ones described in @xcite and @xcite , and the complete surfaces of revolution that we classified in @xcite .",
    "now we briefly describe the organization and the results obtained in this paper .",
    "after the preliminaries section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , we make a detailed study of sub - riemannian geodesics and jacobi fields in section  [ sec : geodesics ] . in section",
    "[ sec : meancurvature ] we look at the first variation of area and prove a minkowski - type formula for an area - stationary surface under a volume constraint relating area , volume and the mean curvature , theorem  [ th : minkowski ] . then , a detailed analysis of the first variation of area , together with the aforementioned description of the singular set in theorem  [ th : chmy ] , leads us to prove in theorem [ th : constant ] that an immersed surface is area - stationary if and only if its mean curvature is zero ( or constant under a volume constraint ) and the characteristic curves meet orthogonally the singular curves .",
    "this result allows us to refine in section [ sec : bernstein ] the bernstein - type theorems given in @xcite and @xcite for minimal graphs in @xmath0 .",
    "we classify all entire area - stationary graphs in @xmath0 over the @xmath2-plane in theorem  [ th : bernstein ] , and show that they are globally area - minimizing in theorem  [ th : areaminimizing ] . in section [ sec : mainresult ] , we prove our main results , where we completely describe immersed area - stationary surfaces in @xmath0 under a volume constraint with non - vanishing mean curvature and non - empty singular set , theorems  [ th : spheres ] and [ th : classification ] . as a consequence",
    "we deduce an alexandrov uniqueness type theorem for compact surfaces , theorem  [ th : alexandrov ] , and we solve the isoperimetric problem in @xmath0 assuming @xmath1 regularity of the solutions in theorem  [ th : iso ] .",
    "now we describe our results in more detail .    a classical formula by minkowski in euclidean space involving the integral of the support function over a compact surface in @xmath10 with constant mean curvature yields the relation @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the area of the surface , @xmath31 is the volume enclosed , and @xmath21 is the mean curvature of the surface .",
    "our analysis of the first variation of the sub - riemannian area and the existence in @xmath0 of a one - parameter group of dilations provide a minkowski - type formula for a surface @xmath15 which is area - stationary under a volume constraint in @xmath0 .",
    "such a formula reads @xmath32 where @xmath30 is the sub - riemannian area of @xmath15 , @xmath21 the mean curvature of @xmath15 , and @xmath31 the volume enclosed .    from previous works , as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , it was already known that a necessary condition for a surface @xmath15 to be area - stationary is that the mean curvature of @xmath15 must be zero ( or constant if the surface is area - stationary under a volume constraint ) . in theorem [ th : constant ]",
    "we show that such a condition is not sufficient . to obtain a stationary point for the area we must require in addition that the _ characteristic curves meet orthogonally the singular curves_. we prove this result by obtaining an expression for the first variation of area for arbitrary variations of the surface @xmath15 , not only for those fixing the singular set .",
    "observe that the situation is different from the one in riemannian geometry , where stationary surfaces are precisely those with vanishing mean curvature .    as a consequence of this analysis",
    ", we show that most of the entire graphs obtained in @xcite and @xcite with mean curvature zero are not area - stationary .",
    "we refine their result to prove that the only entire area - stationary graphs over the @xmath2-plane in @xmath0 are the euclidean planes and vertical rotations of the graphs @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "geometrically , the latter surfaces can be described as the union of all horizontal lines in @xmath0 which are orthogonal to a given horizontal line ( the singular curve ) . by using a calibration argument",
    ", we can prove that they are globally area - minimizing .",
    "this result is similar to the euclidean one , where planes , the only entire minimal graphs in @xmath10 , are area - minimizing . in @xcite , also by a calibration argument , it was proved that a compact portion of the regular part of a graph with mean curvature zero is area - minimizing .",
    "it was already known that the regular part of a surface @xmath15 immersed in @xmath0 with constant mean curvature @xmath21 is foliated by horizontal geodesics of curvature @xmath21 .",
    "we derive in section  [ sec : geodesics ] an intrinsic equation for such geodesics and for jacobi fields , and show in theorem [ th : ruled ] that the characteristic curves of the surface are geodesics of curvature @xmath21 .",
    "this is the starting point , together with the local description of the singular set in theorem  [ th : chmy ] , to construct new examples and to classify surfaces of constant mean curvature in @xmath0 .    in section [ sec : mainresult ] we use this idea to describe any complete , volume - preserving area - stationary surface @xmath15 in @xmath0 with non - vanishing mean curvature and non - empty singular set .",
    "we prove in theorem  [ th : spheres ] that if @xmath15 has at least one isolated singular point then it must be congruent with one of the compact spherical examples @xmath36 obtained as the union of all the geodesics of curvature @xmath37 joining two given points ( example  [ ex : spheres ] ) .",
    "then , we introduce in proposition  [ prop : sigmala ] a procedure to construct examples of complete surfaces with non - vanishing constant mean curvature @xmath38 .",
    "geometrically these surfaces consist of a horizontal curve @xmath39 in @xmath0 , from which geodesics of curvature @xmath38 leave ( or enter ) orthogonally .",
    "an analysis of the variational vector field associated to this family of geodesics is necessary to understand the behavior of the geodesics far away from @xmath39 .",
    "it follows that the resulting surface has two singular curves apart from @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the family of geodesics meets both curves orthogonally if and only if they are equidistant to @xmath39 . this geometric property allows to conclude in theorem  [ th : curve ] the strong restriction that _ the singular curves of any volume - preserving area - stationary surface in @xmath0 with @xmath40 are geodesics of @xmath0_. this is the key ingredient to classify in theorem  [ th : classification ] all surfaces of this kind .",
    "it follows that they must be congruent either with the cylindrical embedded surfaces in example  [ ex : cilindros ] or with the helicoidal immersed surfaces in example  [ ex : helices ] .",
    "this technique can also be used to describe complete area - stationary surfaces with singularities .",
    "it was proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  2.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  8.2 ) that euclidean planes are the only complete minimal surfaces in @xmath0 with at least one isolated singular point . in proposition  [ prop : onesingu ] we give a nice geometric description of complete area - stationary surfaces with singular curves : the singular curve is a unique , arbitrary horizontal curve and the surface consists of the union of all the horizontal lines orthogonal to this singular curve .    alexandrov uniqueness theorem in euclidean space states that the only embedded compact surfaces with constant mean curvature in @xmath10 are round spheres .",
    "this result is not true for immersed surfaces as illustrated by the toroidal examples in @xcite . in pseudo - hermitian geometry ,",
    "an interesting restriction on the topology of an immersed compact surface with bounded mean curvature inside a @xmath3-spherical pseudo - hermitian manifold was given in @xcite , where it was proved that such a surface is homeomorphic either to a sphere or to a torus . as shown in @xcite this bound on the genus is optimal on the standard pseudo - hermitian @xmath3-sphere , where examples of constant mean curvature spheres and tori may be given .",
    "this estimate on the genus is also valid in @xmath0 since the proof is based on the local description of the singular set ( theorem  [ th : chmy ] ) and on the hopf index theorem . in theorem",
    "[ th : alexandrov ] we prove the following counterpart in @xmath0 to alexandrov uniqueness theorem in @xmath10 : any compact , connected , @xmath1 immersed volume - preserving area - stationary surface @xmath15 in @xmath0 is congruent with a sphere @xmath36 . in particular we deduce the non - existence of volume - preserving area - stationary immersed tori in @xmath0 .",
    "finally in section  [ sec : iso ] we study the _ isoperimetric problem _ in @xmath0 .",
    "this problem consists of finding sets in @xmath0 minimizing the sub - riemannian perimeter under a volume constraint .",
    "it was proved by g. p. leonardi and s. rigot @xcite that the solutions to this problem exist and they are bounded , connected open sets .",
    "this information is clearly far from characterizing isoperimetric sets .",
    "in the last years many authors have tried to adapt to the heisenberg group different proofs of the classical isoperimetric inequality in euclidean space . in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was shown that there is no a direct counterpart in @xmath0 to the brunn - minkowski inequality in euclidean space , with the surprising consequence that the carnot - carathdory balls in @xmath0 can not be the solutions .",
    "recently , interest has focused on solving the isoperimetric problem restricted to certain sets with additional symmetries .",
    "it was proved by d. danielli , n. garofalo and d .-",
    "nhieu that the sets bounded by the spherical surfaces @xmath36 are the unique solutions in the class of sets bounded by two @xmath14 radial graphs over the @xmath2-plane ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  14.6 ) . in @xcite",
    "we pointed out that assuming @xmath1 smoothness and rotationally symmetry of isoperimetric regions , these must be congruent with the spheres @xmath36 .",
    "we finish this work by showing in theorem  [ th : iso ] that the spherical surfaces @xmath36 are the unique isoperimetric regions in @xmath0 assuming @xmath1 regularity of the solutions , solving a conjecture by p.  pansu @xcite .",
    "regularity of solutions is still a hard , open question .",
    "after the distribution of this paper , we have noticed some related works . in @xcite ,",
    "interesting results for graphs in the heisenberg group @xmath41 have been established .",
    "in particular , the authors prove in @xcite that @xmath1 minimal graphs in @xmath0 are area - minimizing if and only if the characteristic curves meet orthogonally the singular curves . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that the sets bounded by the spheres @xmath42 are the unique isoperimetric regions in the class of sets bounded by the union of two @xmath14 graphs over the @xmath2-plane . in @xcite the authors show that there exists a family of entire _ intrinsic minimal graphs _ in @xmath0 that are not area - minimizing . in @xcite the mean curvature flow of a @xmath1 convex surface in @xmath0 , described as the union of two radial graphs ,",
