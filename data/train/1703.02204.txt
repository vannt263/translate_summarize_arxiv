    "while @xmath63 increases abruptly at @xmath2 = 3 k , it only reaches 66% of @xmath64 at this temperature and recovers 90 % of @xmath64 near @xmath65 k. such behavior is typical for many ce - based materials , and may provide evidence that the cerium magnetic moment is partly compensated by the conduction electrons through the kondo interaction.@xcite    in figs .",

    "this differs from what is seen in many metallic magnets where the removal of spin scattering results in a decrease of @xmath59 at the ordering temperature .",

    "despite the fact that there are no obvious conditions for geometric frustration , it is initially appealing to describe the rich magnetic behavior of cesbse in these terms .",
    "to clarify this situation , we first consider that a frustration parameter @xmath5 @xmath3 @xmath68@xmath39@xmath68/@xmath2 @xmath48 10 can be calculated from the high temperature curie - weiss susceptibility .",
    "this value is comparable to that of other frustrated magnets,@xcite but this analysis neglects important features of the low temperature state : e.g. , that the kondo interaction and crystal electric field splitting of the hund s rule multiplet play important roles . to roughly estimate the impact of these factors , we consider curie - weiss fits to the data for @xmath0 @xmath27 20k , which yield @xmath39 @xmath69 -4 k for @xmath70 ( @xmath69 1 k for @xmath71 ) , giving a reduced @xmath5 @xmath27 1 .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that conventional magnetic frustration describes the low temperature behavior .",
    "we further note that the low temperature kondo scale can be estimated from the expression @xmath39",
    "2@xmath72.@xcite given the small low temperature @xmath39s , this implies that in the vicinity of the ordered state the magnetic exchange and kondo energy scales are similar and hence the exact ground state behavior would depend on a fine balance between them .",
    "another route to magnetic complexity is through balancing of nearest- , next nearest- , etc .",
    "neighbor interactions , where a well known example is the anisotropic next nearest neighbor ising ( annni ) model.@xcite in order to probe the relevance of this type of scenario to cesbse , we studied the electrical resistivity under applied pressure , where transitions associated with the devil s staircase appear as sharp reductions in resistance ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we find that ( 1 ) @xmath2 increases with @xmath73 and ( 2 ) the general features of the field induced phases are preserved but move to higher @xmath1 .",

    "our result suggests that hydrostatic pressure changes the lattice constants such that the devil s staircaise is preserved , but with larger critical magnetic fields .",

    "@xcite however , our current measurements do not provide definitive insight because of conflicting conclusions regarding the presence of chemical / structural disorder .",
    "on one hand , there is ample evidence that the crystals are highly ordered ; ( 1 ) single crystal x - ray diffraction measurements suggest that there is little site interchange , ( 2 ) the magnetic phase transitions are sharp both in temperature and magnetic field , and ( 3 ) earlier studies of the isolelectronic analogues cesbte and lasbte support the view that the semimetallic behavior results from the @xmath5-electron kondo lattice : while cesbte exhibits poor metallic or doped semiconducting behavior,@xcite its non-4@xmath5 analogue lasbte is metallic.@xcite on the other hand , the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity presented here for cesbse suggests that disorder scattering dominates in the low temperature region , and the small value of the electronic heat capacity could be explained in the context of a disordered and weakly correlated metal . before progress can be made to clarify the electronic state , it will be necessary to better understand the role of disorder in this material .",
