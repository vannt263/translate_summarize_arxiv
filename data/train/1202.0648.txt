    "the massless gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite is the 1 + 1 dimensional quantum field theory of @xmath0 flavors of massless dirac fermions , interacting through a scalar - scalar contact interaction . suppressing flavor labels as usual ,",

    "the gn model can be thought of as relativistic version of particles moving along a line and interacting via an attractive @xmath3-potential .",
    "however , it exhibits many non - trivial features characteristic for relativistic quantum fields such as covariance , renormalizability , asymptotic freedom , dimensional transmutation , spontaneous symmetry breaking , interacting dirac sea .",
    "it is also one of the few models known where most of the non - perturbative questions of interest to strong interaction physics can be answered in closed analytical form .",
    "such calculations have turned out to be both challenging and instructive , generating a continued interest in this particular  toy model \" over several decades , see e.g. the review articles @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we address the problem of time - dependent scattering of multi - fermion bound states in full generality .",
    "as will be recalled in more detail in the next section , the gn model possesses bound states which can be viewed as  baryons \" , with fermions bound in a dynamically created  bag \" of the scalar field @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "there are even multi - baryon bound states which might be identified with ",
    "nuclei \" @xcite .",
    "standard large @xmath0 arguments tell us that all of these bound states can be described adequately within a relativistic version of the hartree - fock ( hf ) approach .    turning to the baryon - baryon scattering problem ,",
    "the tool of choice is the time - dependent version of hartree - fock ( tdhf ) , as originally suggested by witten @xcite .",
    "the basic equations in that case are easy to state , @xmath5 but hard to solve , even in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "one of the reasons is the fact that the sum over occupied states includes the dirac sea , so that one is dealing with an infinite set of coupled , non - linear partial differential equations .",
    "no systematic , analytical method for solving such a complicated problem is known .",
    "nevertheless , the exact solution for the time - dependent scattering problem of two baryons has recently been found in closed analytical form by means of a joint ansatz for @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it provides us with a microscopic solution of the scattering of two composite , relativistic objects , exact in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the necessary details will be briefly summarized below .",
    "this result encourages us to go on and try to solve more ambitious scattering problems involving any number of bound states , including  nuclei \" in addition to the  nucleons \" considered so far .",

    "to put this study into perspective , we summarize what is known about multi - fermion bound states and their mutual interactions in the massless gn model , eq .  ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "static multi - fermion bound states have been derived systematically with the help of inverse scattering theory and resolvent methods @xcite .",
    "the best known examples are the callan - coleman - gross - zee kink ( cited in @xcite ) and the dashen - hasslacher - neveu ( dhn ) baryon @xcite , both of which can accommodate up to @xmath0 fermions .",
    "the kink is topologically non - trivial , reflecting the @xmath8 chiral symmetry of the massless gn model .",
    "its shape ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and mass are independent of its fermion content .",
    "the dhn baryon is topologically trivial and stabilized by the bound fermions which affect its shape and mass , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "multi - baryon bound states have been constructed systematically by feinberg @xcite .",
    "they possess continuous parameters related to the position of the baryon constituents on which the mass of the bound state does not depend (  moduli \" ) .",
    "they may be topologically trivial like the dhn baryon or non - trivial like the kink , depending on the ( spatial ) asymptotic behavior of @xmath6 .",
    "some examples are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "a common feature of all static solutions is the fact that the scalar potential is transparent , i.e. , the fermion reflection coefficient vanishes for all energies .",
    "consequently the self - consistent , static solutions of the gn model coincide with the transparent scalar potentials of the dirac equation , investigated independently by nogami and coworkers @xcite .",
    "since the static dirac equation can be mapped onto a pair of ( supersymmetric ) schrdinger equations , this also yields a bridge between static , self - consistent dirac - hf solutions on the one hand and transparent potentials of the schrdinger equation on the other hand , a problem solved long ago by kay and moses @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic limit of the topologically trivial , static gn solutions are well - known multi - soliton solutions of coupled non - linear schrdinger ( nls ) equations , arising in the hartree approximation to particles in 1d with attractive @xmath3-interactions @xcite .    by boosting any static solution , one can trivially generate solutions of the tdhf equation @xcite .",
    "this kind of solution enters in the asymptotic states of the scattering problem which we are going to study .",
    "the breather is a time - dependent , oscillating solution of kink - antikink type .",
    "it was found by dhn , using the analogy with the sine - gordon breather @xcite .",
    "since it is neither a conventional bound state nor a scattering state , it has no analogue in real particle physics , but is reminiscent of collective , vibrational excitations of heavy nuclei or molecules .",
    "this underlines the classical character of the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we shall not consider scattering of breathers in the present work .",
    "following a suggestion in ref .",
    "@xcite , kink - antikink scattering was solved in tdhf by analytic continuation of the breather @xcite .",
    "since the fermions do not react back , it is possible to map this problem rigorously onto the problem of kink - antikink scattering in sinh - gordon theory .",
    "if we set @xmath9 , then @xmath10 satisfies the classical sinh - gordon equation @xmath11 ( in natural units ) , as first noticed by neveu and papanicolaou @xcite .",
    "this mapping can be generalized .",
    "the known multi - soliton solutions of the sinh - gordon equation yield the self - consistent scalar potential for scattering of any number of kinks and antikinks @xcite .",
    "a poor man s simulation of nuclear interactions was the scattering of  trains \" of solitons moving with almost the same speed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( there are no multi - soliton bound states ) .",
    "kink dynamics has no non - relativistic analogue since the internal structure of kink is ultrarelativistic , as evidenced by a zero - energy bound state .",
    "time - dependent kink - antikink scattering is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "a crucial ingredient in proving the correspondence between kink dynamics and sinh - gordon solitons is the fact that kink solutions satisfy the self - consistency mode - by - mode .",
    "they are of  type i \" in the classification of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath12 with constant @xmath13 for every single particle state @xmath14 .",
    "this is also the basis for an interesting geometrical interpretation of tdhf solutions , relating time - dependent solutions of the gn model to the embedding of surfaces of constant mean curvature into 3d spaces @xcite .",
    "scattering of dhn baryons is significantly more involved than kink - antikink scattering .",
    "presumably because the fermions react back , it does not seem possible to map this problem onto any known soliton equation .",
    "the exact tdhf solution for baryon - baryon scattering was found recently in a different way , namely by ansatz @xcite .",
    "a specific example is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "since we shall follow the same strategy in the present paper , we briefly recall the main ideas behind the ansatz , referring the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for technical details .",
    "the ansatz can best be described as follows .",
    "we start from the scalar mean field of a single ( boosted ) dhn baryon with label @xmath15 .",
    "it can be cast into the form of a rational function of an exponential @xmath16 , @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is a parameter governing the size of the baryon and related to its fermion number @xmath19 via @xmath20 @xmath21 denotes the baryon velocity , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is an arbitrary real factor expressing the freedom of choosing the initial baryon position .",
    "the dirac components of the continuum spinor have the same rational form with different coefficients in the numerator only and an additional plane wave factor , @xmath24 the asymptotic behavior at fixed @xmath25 is @xmath26 for @xmath27 , showing that the potential is transparent .",
    "in order to solve the scattering problem for baryons @xmath15 and @xmath28 , we start by multiplying @xmath29 and @xmath30 and expand the numerator and denominator , @xmath31 this may be viewed as scalar potential for non - interacting baryons .",
    "the ansatz for interacting baryons proposed in @xcite now consists in assuming that the only effect of the interaction is to change the coefficients in the numerator and denominator of ( [ 2.5 ] ) , keeping the polynomial dependence on @xmath32 the same .",
    "likewise , the ansatz for the spinor is obtained by multiplying the rational factors of @xmath33 for baryons @xmath15 and @xmath28 and allowing for changes in the coefficients only .",
    "the overall exponential factor is kept unchanged , since it is expected that the potential is reflectionless also in the interacting case .",
    "it turns out that most of the coefficients in @xmath6 and @xmath33 are in fact determined by the asymptotic in- and out - states .",
    "only 4 coefficients remain to be determined , namely the factors in front of the monomials @xmath34 in the three numerators and the common denominator .",
    "inserting this ansatz into the dirac equation determines the missing coefficients and confirms that this simple idea yields the exact solution of the 2-baryon problem .",
    "so far , we have discussed only the fermion continuum states .",
    "bound states can be obtained by analytic continuation in a spectral parameter ( a function of @xmath35 ) and subsequent normalization .",
    "self - consistency can then be checked explicitly , confirming that the ansatz solves the tdhf problem .",
    "the solution is found to be of type iii , i.e. , the scalar density of any single particle orbit can be expressed as a linear combination of 3 distinct functions of ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "we have no a priori argument why the ansatz should be successful , but its simple form is most certainly a large-@xmath0 manifestation of the quantum integrability of finite-@xmath0 gn models .",
    "the result for the non - trivial coefficients is rather complicated , but by a proper choice of variables and light cone coordinates , one manages to keep all coefficients in rational form .",
    "unlike in the kink - antikink case , the non - relativistic limit is now accessible , since the dhn baryon goes over into the soliton of the nls equation in the limit of small fermion number .",
    "starting from the two - baryon solution , one then recovers the time - dependent solutions of the multi - component nls equation of nogami and warke for @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this completes the overview of the present state of the art .",
    "here we propose to extend the two - baryon tdhf scattering solution of ref .",
    "@xcite to an arbitrary number of composite colliding particles , including multi - baryon bound states (  nuclei \" ) in addition to baryons .",
    "the central idea is to use an ansatz for the scalar potential inspired by the product of @xmath0 single baryon potentials , assuming that only the coefficients of the resulting rational function of @xmath38 will be affected by the interactions .",
    "a convenient choice of the dirac matrices in 1 + 1 dimensions is @xmath39 together with light cone coordinates @xmath40 this simplifies the dirac - tdhf equation to @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the upper , left - handed , @xmath43 the lower , right - handed spinor component .",
    "we posit the following ansatz for the scalar tdhf potential , @xmath44 as motivated in the preceding section , @xmath6 is assumed to be a rational function of @xmath0 exponentials @xmath16 , where @xmath0 is the number of baryons , @xmath45 each summation index @xmath46 runs over the values 0,1,2 , and the coefficients @xmath47 are real .",
    "the basic exponential @xmath16 has the form inferred from the single dhn baryon in flight , @xmath48 the parameter @xmath18 specifies the size ( or , equivalently , fermion number ) of the @xmath15-th baryon .",
    "@xmath49 is related to the baryon rapidity @xmath50 and velocity @xmath21 via @xmath51 for @xmath18 we shall use the parametrization @xmath52 to avoid the appearance of square roots .",
    "apart from the @xmath53 parameters @xmath54 , the baryon constituents are characterized by @xmath0 arbitrary , real scale factors @xmath23 needed to specify their initial positions .",
    "the @xmath16 must be ordered according to baryon velocities .",
    "we choose the convention that @xmath55 if @xmath56 .",

    "( [ 3.15 ] ) is altogether equivalent to @xmath77 algebraic equations for the coefficients @xmath78 of our ansatz .",
    "in this and the following section , we present our results for the coefficients entering the scalar potential and the continuum spinors for @xmath0 baryons , i.e. , the coefficients of the polynomials @xmath72 introduced above . they fall naturally into 2 classes : ",
    "reducible \" coefficients which can be related to the @xmath79 baryon problem , and  irreducible \" ones which can not .",

    ", @xmath82 drops out of the expressions for @xmath6 and @xmath83 .",
    "since this can be done for any label @xmath84 , one gets a large number of recursion relations . as explained in greater detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , one has to take into account time delays and ( in the case of the spinors ) transmission amplitudes for final states , depending on whether the eliminated baryon @xmath84 has been scattered from the remaining @xmath79 baryons or not .",
    "let us consider the scalar potential first .",

    "the factors @xmath89 appear here because relations ( [ 4.1 ] ) determine only the ratio @xmath90 .",
    "they can be fixed as follows .",
    "we normalize the lowest and highest coefficients of @xmath61 to 1 for any number of baryons , @xmath91 this is always possible since we must recover the vacuum potential @xmath92 in the limit where all @xmath16 go to 0 or @xmath93 , and the @xmath16 contain arbitrary scale factors @xmath23 , see eq .",

    "for the spinors , we have to take into account transmission amplitudes in addition to the time delay factors . consequently the general reduction formulas ( [ 4.1 ] ) have to be replaced by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the transmission amplitude of baryon @xmath84",

    "since the dirac equation reduces to a set of algebraic equations and all ingredients are known rational functions , one would not expect any particular difficulties in checking that the spinor satisfies the dirac equation , using computer algebra programs like maple .",
    "however , the complexity of the resulting expressions increases rapidly with increasing baryon number , quickly exceeding the capabilities of maple due to storage and computation time problems .",
    "thus , for @xmath37 and @xmath131 , we could still check all @xmath160 algebraic equations analytically with maple in a straightforward way . for @xmath161 or larger , the maximum size of expressions which maple can handle is exceeded and we have only been able to check our results numerically , for random values of the input parameters @xmath156 .",
    "this test has been carried out successfully for @xmath162 . by increasing the number of digits , one can find out whether the floating point result is exact or approximate .",
    "since the number of operations increases faster than exponentially with @xmath0 , it is actually necessary to run maple with very high accuracy for large @xmath0 values .",
    "thus for example , during a full @xmath163 calculation , 40 digits get lost , so that one has to start out with 50 digits precision to be sure that the dirac equation is solved exactly .",
    "clearly , there must be a way of proving our results in full generality .",
    "the complexity of the solution and the intricate way in which @xmath0 baryon scattering is related to the scattering problem of fewer baryons have prevented us so far from finding such a proof .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , our result still has the status of a conjecture . in the meantime",
    ", we shall restrict all applications shown below to problems with low values of @xmath0 for which we have established the validity beyond any doubt .",
    "we are confident that the results hold for arbitrary @xmath0 , but this has to await a complete mathematical proof .    up to this point",
    ", we have only dealt with the dirac equation for continuum spinors .",
    "this still leaves open other aspects of the full tdhf problem like bound states , self - consistency , and fermion density . in some sense ,",
    "all we have achieved so far is to find time - dependent , transparent potentials for the dirac equation , which look asymptotically like boosted static potentials .",
    "this solves in part another open problem which has been raised in the literature @xcite , namely to classify all time - dependent , transparent potentials of the 1 + 1 dimensional dirac equation .",
    "how general is our result in this respect ?",
    "all static transparent potentials are well known ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] ) .",
    "we can now construct all time - dependent transparent potentials which asymptotically consist of an arbitrary number of such static solutions , boosted to arbitrary velocities .",
    "this can not be the complete set of all transparent potentials though , as evidenced by the example of the breather which does not fit into this scheme .",
    "evidently , there must be another set of solutions where boosted breathers appear as asymptotic states , in addition to boosted static bound states .",
    "we do not know yet whether our ansatz will be capable of describing this more general class of solutions .",
    "all we have checked is that the single breather can indeed be reproduced with our ansatz , provided we allow for complex valued @xmath16 s .",
    "scattering problems involving breathers are interesting in their own right , but will be left for future studies .",
    "in the @xmath0 baryon problem , one expects @xmath0 positive and @xmath0 negative energy bound states . as discussed in ref .",

    "@xcite and numerically for @xmath131 by us .",
    "the situation in the @xmath0-baryon problem is the same as in the 2-baryon problem @xcite .",
    "the scalar density for a continuum state can be decomposed as @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the perturbative piece which gives self - consistency by itself .",
    "the 2nd part is cancelled against the discrete state contribution , @xmath174 if one makes use of the self - consistency conditions in the asymptotic in- and out - states .",
    "we can deduce @xmath175 by subtracting the expression ( [ 8.2 ] ) from the full scalar density and can then check eq .",

    "this test has been performed analytically for @xmath37 in ref .",

    "the integral is convergent owing to the vacuum subtraction .",
    "we have checked this identity here numerically for @xmath131 . from this and the self - consistency relation , one can again express the total , subtracted fermion density through the bound state densities as @xmath177 generalizing the @xmath37 results @xcite .",

    "this fact has actually already been used in the normalization conditions ( [ 4.8 ] ) .",
    "the more interesting question is how to characterize the outcome of the scattering process in terms of the baryon or multi - baryon bound states . comparing the asymptotics for @xmath179",

    "the scattering process at the level of the tdhf potential is classical , so that the situation is analogous to classical soliton scattering .",
    "if a single baryon is involved in the scattering process , the situation is very simple .",
    "the incoming and outgoing baryons can be associated with straight - line space - time trajectories defined by @xmath182 they have the same slope in the ( @xmath36 ) diagram , since the velocity does not change .",
    "the factor @xmath183 given in eq .",
    "( [ 9.2 ] ) then leads to a parallel shift of the outgoing space - time trajectory , which is usually interpreted as time delay ( or advance ) .",
    "if an @xmath159-baryon bound state (  nucleus \" ) is scattered , the initial state contains @xmath159 baryon constituents @xmath184 moving with the same velocity @xmath185 on parallel straight - line trajectories .",
    "such a bound state depends on the scale factors @xmath23 of @xmath16 (  moduli \" ) , cf .",
    "( [ 3.6 ] ) , determining the relative positions and the shape of the bound state without affecting its energy . in the final state",
    ", the @xmath159 trajectories will be displaced laterally relative to the incoming trajectories . since",
    "all @xmath186 parameters within one composite state must be chosen differently , according to ( [ 9.2 ] ) , the displacement will be different for each trajectory .",
    "therefore the net result can not be interpreted anymore as a mere time delay , but is always accompanied by a change in moduli space , resulting in different relative baryon positions and a corresponding deformation of the scalar potential . in this sense ,",
    "the scattering process is not really elastic and the composite bound states undergo a change in their internal structure",
    ". a time delay of the full composite object could be defined , but this is neither unambiguous , nor necessary .",
    "the full asymptotic information about the scattering process is contained in eq .",
    "( [ 9.2 ] ) .",
    "since we have verified the above formulas analytically or numerically with high precision for up to 8 baryons , we now present some illustrative results for smaller values of @xmath0 . depending on the choice of velocity parameters ,",
    "the same formalism can describe a variety of physical problems .    for @xmath37 , there are two distinct possibilities .",
    "if the velocities are chosen to be equal , we obtain a boosted 2-baryon bound state , provided that the @xmath186 parameters are different .",
    "if the velocities are different , there is no restriction on the @xmath186 parameters and we describe scattering of baryon ( @xmath187 ) on baryon ( @xmath188 ) . in both cases ,",
    "this yields nothing new as compared to refs .",
    "@xcite , but has been used to test our formulas .    for @xmath131 , we have to distinguish 3 cases .",
    "if @xmath189 and all @xmath18 s are different , we are dealing with a boosted 3-baryon bound state .",
    "if two velocities are equal and the corresponding @xmath186-parameters are different , the formalism describes scattering of a baryon on a 2-baryon bound state , analogous to @xmath190-scattering in nature .",
    "an example of this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where the time evolution of the scalar tdhf potential during the collision is displayed .",
    "as announced above , the internal structure of the bound state necessarily changes during such a collision . to emphasize this point",
    ", we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the first and last time slice of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , i.e. , the incoming and outgoing states .    1.0 cm",
    "if all 3 velocities are different , the formalism describes a 3-baryon scattering process with 3 baryons in the initial and final state .",
    "since scattering processes with more than 2 incident particles are somewhat academic from the particle physics point of view , we do not show any example .",
    "with increasing @xmath0 , the number of scattering channels increases .",
    "the next number of baryons is @xmath161 , describing one boosted 4-baryon bound state , scattering of a baryon on a 3-baryon bound state , scattering of two 2-baryon bound states , scattering of 3 particles ( 2 baryons and a 2-baryon bound state ) or of 4 particles ( 4 individual baryons ) .",
    "the most interesting and new process out of these is the scattering of 2 bound states , the analogue of @xmath191-scattering  the simplest case of nucleus - nucleus scattering .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "the change in structure of the bound state is exhibited more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .    1.0 cm    finally , we give an example with 5 baryons . out of the many possibilities ,",
    "we have chosen scattering of a single baryon on a 4-baryon bound state , the analogue of @xmath192-scattering in the real world , see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "we refrain from showing any results with larger number of baryons , since we have not yet checked our formulas thoroughly beyond @xmath193 .",
    "however , we have no doubt that we could describe correctly scattering processes with any number of baryons .",
    "all of these examples involve topologically trivial bound states only .",
    "there is no difficulty in applying the same formulas to topologically non - trivial scatterers as well . as already demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , all one has to do is let one or several @xmath186 s go to 1 .",
    "then , the corresponding baryon becomes a kink - antikink pair at infinite separation .",
    "this diverging separation has to be compensated by a change of the scale parameter @xmath23 in the @xmath16 factor , so that half of the baryon disappears at infinity . in this way",
    "one can describe scattering of any number of topologically trivial or non - trivial bound states , without need to derive separate formulas for this purpose .",
    "this paper has dealt with the large @xmath0 limit of the gn model , the quantum field theory of massless , self - interacting , flavored fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the fascinating aspect of lagrangian ( [ 1.1 ] ) is the fact that a single contact interaction term is able to generate a host of non - trivial phenomena .",
    "even more surprisingly , it seems that all of these can be worked out in closed analytical form , a rather exceptional situation in quantum field theory .",
    "the story begins with asymptotic freedom , the generation of a dynamical fermion mass , accompanied by spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath8 chiral symmetry , and a scalar fermion - antifermion bound state , in the original work @xcite .",
    "soon afterwards baryons were discovered @xcite , subsequently complemented by a whole zoo of multi - baryon bound states @xcite . as time evolved and computer algebra software became more powerful , ambitions were raised , leading to results like soliton crystals in the ground state and phase diagram of dense matter @xcite or time - dependent scattering processes of kinks and antikinks @xcite .",
    "the most recent result is the tdhf solution of time - dependent baryon - baryon scattering @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we have tried to add another chapter to this progress report . by generalizing the joint ansatz for the tdhf potential and the spinors recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have most probably found the solution to a whole class of scattering problems , namely all those where the incoming and outgoing scatterers are boosted , static multi - fermion bound states of the gn model .",
    "the word  probably \" has to be used here because we have not yet been able to prove our results in full generality .",
    "the solution which we have presented is based on the analytical solution of the 2- and 3-baryon problems , followed by a tentative extrapolation to arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "these results have then been checked numerically for @xmath162 , and all heralds well for their general validity .",
    "this method could only work because of a kind of factorization property which we have observed  scattering of any number of baryons can apparently be predicted on the basis of 1- and 2-baryon input only .",
    "this holds not only for the asymptotic scattering data , but also during the entire time evolution , where more than 2 baryons can overlap at a time .",
    "we interpret these findings as a large-@xmath0 manifestation of the quantum integrability of the gn model .",
    "the solution which we have presented is relevant for yet another problem , namely how to find transparent , time - dependent scalar potentials for the dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "it is clear that unlike in the static case , we have not yet arrived at the most general time - dependent solution .",
    "at least one time - dependent solution of the gn model is already known which does not belong to our class of solutions , the breather .",
    "it also yields a reflectionless potential .",
    "this suggests that a whole class of solutions is still missing , namely the tdhf potentials of scattering processes involving breathers in the initial and final states .",
    "we know already that the single breather can be obtained with our ansatz if one admits complex valued exponentials @xmath16",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether breather - baryon or breather - breather scattering can be solved along similar lines .",
    "one other question which we have not been able to answer yet is whether our new solution is related to the solution of some known , classical non - linear equation or system of equations .",
    "this question is a natural one , given prior experience .",
    "thus for instance , all static baryons can be related to soliton solutions of the static nls equation .",
    "higher bound states are related to the static multi - channel nls equation .",
    "all dynamical kink solutions can be mapped onto multi - soliton solutions of the sinh - gordon equation .",
    "the non - relativistic limit of baryon - baryon scattering was shown to be equivalent to solutions of the time - dependent , multi - component nls equation .",
    "the advantage of such mappings is obvious .",
    "a lot of expertise and powerful techniques have been accumulated in the field of non - linear systems over the years , which can be helpful for finding new solutions of the gn model or proving certain results in full generality . a natural candidate for the present case would be the multi - component non - linear dirac equation , i.e. , the set of classical equations @xmath194 inspection of the various condensates in sec .",
    "[ sect8 ] shows that it is indeed possible to construct solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 11.1 ] ) using our results .",
    "one needs @xmath195 components for @xmath0 baryons , since the solution is of type @xmath195 .",
    "however , it is not possible to restrict oneself to normalizable states as in the non - relativistic limit of the multi - component nls equation .",
    "one would have to invoke @xmath0 different bound states and one continuum state .",
    "hence , even if our results are related to the classical system ( [ 11.1 ] ) , it seems very unlikely that the solution presented here has already been given in the literature .",
    "keeping a continuum state as one of the components would be very hard to interpret classically .",
    "this is obviously a remnant of the dirac sea , without analogue in the classical fermion system .",
