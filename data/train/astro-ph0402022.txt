    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies , especially dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies , are used to derive the profiles of the dark halos which are very useful as tests for the standard cold dark matter scenario ( e.g. , de blok & bosma 2002 ) .",
    "the usual assumption is that the dynamics of the neutral atomic gas is a good tracer of the radial gravitational force .",
    "it can be shown that although spiral waves and non - circular motions may contribute to produce substructure in the rotation curves ( e.g. , de blok , bosma & mcgaugh 2003 ) , they do not alter the rotation curves significantly for the galaxies selected in these investigations .",
    "galactic magnetic fields could also affect the gas dynamics in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the random small - scale component of the galactic magnetic fields acts as a pressure , giving support to the disk and , therefore , leading to a rotation ( slightly ) slower than the gravitational circular speed .",
    "by contrast , some configurations of the large - scale magnetic field can give rise to a faster circular velocity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed the so - called `` magnetic alternative '' to dark matter in which the contribution of the magnetic pinch could be large enough to explain the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies without the necessity of dark matter .",
    "this is an interesting possibility because some universal properties such as the disk - halo conspiracy or the hi - dark matter constant relation , first noticed by @xcite , would have a natural explanation in this scenario @xcite , as well as the truncation of stellar disks @xcite .",
    "however , after the publication of the paper by @xcite , a plethora of possible difficulties faced by the model was pointed out by different authors @xcite . in an extensive review , @xcite argue that all the shortcomings can be overcome and , therefore , magnetism can explain the way in which galaxies rotate , without the help of dark matter .",
    "a certain mhd configuration has the ability of producing a faster rotation of the whole plasma in the system , i.e.  magnetic confinement , when the net contribution of the magnetic fields to the virial theorem is negative ( in the conventional notation ) . in an isolated system",
    ", it is well known that the magnetic field contribution to the virial theorem , applied to a large enough volume , is _ positive or zero _ , but never negative , reflecting the net expansive tendency of magnetic fields ( e.g. , shafranov 1966 ) .",
    "@xcite used this argument to conclude that in the presence of magnetic fields , galaxies would need even more dark matter than in the unmagnetized case .",
    "one could argue that , since the virial theorem uses global ( volume - integrated ) variables , it is possible that magnetism has a `` centrifugal '' action in the vertical direction but centripetal in the radial direction ( radial confinement ) and , therefore , the expansive tendency of magnetic fields manifests only in the vertical direction .",
    "we advance that this claim is very wrong .",
    "an alternative way out is to assume that galaxies are not at isolation but embedded in the ubiquitous ( magnetized ) intergalactic medium which would be responsible for the required radial confinement .    motivated by these ideas and given the importance of a correct interpretation of the rotation curves for cosmology",
    ", we will try to put bounds on the effects of magnetic fields on the hi rotation curves .",
    "however , we do not restrict ourselves to discuss the viability of explaining rotation curves without dark halos ; the orbits of galactic globular clusters , the satellite galaxies and possibly the dynamics of remote stars in the outer galactic halo , which are not affected by magnetic fields , strongly argue in favor of a dark halo around the milky way ( e.g.  freeman 1997 ) .",
    "the main issue is to see whether galactic magnetic fields can alter appreciably the hi rotation curves , especially in external galaxies for which the dark matter content is almost entirely derived from the rotation curve of the gas .",
    "only if the answer is negative , we can be confident that the profiles of dark halos , the dark matter content in galaxies as well as other interesting empirical correlations found between , for instance , halo parameters and luminosity are reliable .",
    "our investigation will be focus on the _ radial _ equilibrium configuration of magnetized rotating disks . for reasons that should become clear later",
    ", the analysis of the radial equation of motion puts stringent bounds on the maximum magnetic effects to the rotation curves ; this being free of other complicating assumptions that appear in studies of the vertical equilibrium configuration such as the external pressure , the vertical dependence of the magnetic field within the height of the hi thin disk , or the flattening of the dark halo , which are all very uncertain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : ingredients ] we describe the ingredients of a simplified model in which magnetic fields could give rise to a faster rotation in the outer parts of hi disks . in  [ sec : core ] the maximum effect on the rotation curves is studied .",
    "other difficulties inherent to the magnetic alternative are discussed in  [ sec : caveats ] .",
    "the case of magnetic fields producing a slower rotation and their role as a possible remedy to the cuspy problem of dark halos is left to ",
    "[ sec : dwarf ] and the final remarks are given in  [ sec : final ] .",
    "in this section , we describe some basic concepts useful for understanding the remainder of the paper .",
    "the issue of the problem of radial confinement will be addressed in  [ sec : core ] .      in presenting the role of the magnetic tension in the hi rotation curves ,",
    "the equations are simplified by assuming an equilibrium , steady - state , axisymmetric disk of a slightly ionized gas with a purely azimuthal large - scale magnetic field @xmath3 ( e.g. , battaner et al .",
    "1992 ; snchez - salcedo 1997 ) .",
    "the radial component of the equation of motion of the gas at @xmath4 in cylindrical coordinates reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gas density at @xmath4 , @xmath7 the circular speed of the gas , @xmath8 the gravitational potential created by all masses in the system , and @xmath9 is the gas pressure consisting of the thermal , turbulent , convective , and cosmic ray components plus also the magnetic pressure arising from the random magnetic field component , but does not include the magnetic pressure arising from the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "all these variables should be taken at the midplane of the disk . in equation ( [ eq : vphi ] )",
    "it was assumed @xmath10 , and thus we kept only the dominant terms associated with @xmath11 . in terms of the total pressure @xmath12 , it can be rewritten as : @xmath13 the second term of the rhs is the radial pressure force that acts inwards or outwards depending on whether @xmath14 increases outwards or inwards .",
    "the third term is the magnetic tensile force which always imposes a net inward force .",
    "we should remind that ordered galactic - scale magnetic fields are not expected to be a general feature in all disk galaxies , especially in dwarf galaxies .",
    "although observations of magnetic fields in these galaxies are scarce , they do not indicate magnetic fields with a global symmetry , but a much more chaotic galactic - scale field than in normal spirals ( e.g. , chyzy et al .",
    "therefore , models based on a regular azimuthal magnetic field may not be an adequate representation for all of them .",
    "in fact , indirect observations suggest that regular magnetic fields may be ignorable , at least in some dwarf galaxies",
    ". the dominance of spherical holes in the hi of the nearby dwarf galaxy ic 2574 has lead @xcite to conclude that large - scale magnetic fields are dynamically unimportant in the outer parts of this galaxy .",
    "as it is shown in appendix a , @xmath9 is always a decreasing function of @xmath15 in approximately - isothermal , exponential galactic disks , even if the disk were embedded in an ambient medium with high pressure .",
    "therefore , the asymmetric drift always produces a force pointing outwards and hence it can never contribute to enhance the circular speed of the gas .",
    "moreover , the asymmetric drift is almost negligible in rotating galactic disks except in very low - mass galaxies such as ddo 50 @xcite .",
    "thus we will also ignore it , hence @xmath16 , and the force balance equation is simplified to @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gravitational circular velocity .",
    "note that the magnetic pressure arising from the large - scale field is kept in our analysis because it can not be neglected in general .",
    "the role of the magnetic pressure term associated with the random ( small - scale ) magnetic field component is discussed in detail in  [ sec : dwarf ] .",
    "it should be also clear that the vertical gradient of @xmath19 is not negligible when considering the vertical configuration of the disk , since it is the main agent responsible for the vertical support against gravity .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vphisecond ] ) we see that for a purely azimuthal magnetic field decaying radially not faster than @xmath20 , the magnetic tension force produces radial confinement .",
    "such configuration is usually called a linear or z - pinch .",
    "the resulting inward magnetic force , the pinch , accounts for the required centripetal force responsible for an anomalous faster rotation .",
    "our aim is to constrain the maximum effect of the z - pinch in galactic disks from very general grounds .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the z - pinch configuration is not used in tokamaks as interchange and other instabilities quickly destroy the magnetic configuration ( e.g. , roberts 1967 ) .",
    "restricted to purely azimuthal fields , the force - free magnetic configuration occurs for a field profile @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the magnetic strength at some radius @xmath23 . for that profile ,",
    "the outward magnetic pressure force is in balance with the inward tensile force at any radius .",
    "this profile is , however , rather unphysical because it is singular at @xmath24 .",
    "observations of galactic magnetic fields suggest that the radial component of the field , @xmath25 , is comparable to @xmath3 at least in the optical disk and hence neglecting @xmath25 may not be a good approximation .",
    "one could argue , however , that the magnetic pitch angle becomes very small in the outermost parts of galactic disks , where measurements of the field orientation are scarce . since @xmath25 is not well - suited to produce radial confinement , the most optimistic and simplest situation , in order to maximize the magnetic effects on the rotation curves ,",
    "occurs when the field is taken as purely azimuthal . as we are interested in putting upper limits on the role of magnetic fields we will assume throughout this paper that @xmath26 in the outer disk to give the model as much leeway as possible , as it is assumed in the magnetic alternative .",
    "an important contribution to @xmath19 is the turbulent pressure . for a certain component of the interstellar medium , the averaged turbulent pressure is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the one - dimensional turbulent velocity dispersion . for the hi components , @xmath29@xmath30 km s@xmath1",
    "( e.g. , boulares & cox 1990 ) and is nearly constant with galactocentric radius and also from galaxy to galaxy ( sellwood & balbus 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the magnetic field is said to be in equipartition with the turbulent motions when the gas - to - magnetic field pressure ratio is @xmath31 , or equivalently , when the turbulent velocity dispersion coincides with the alfvn speed . in the literature",
    ", one often finds the statement that dynamo action in a thin disk saturates at equipartition field strengths ( e.g. , ruzmaikin , sokoloff & shukurov 1988 ; shu 1992 ; poezd , shukurov & sokoloff 1993 ; beck et al .",
    "1996 ; kulsrud 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to estimate those values of @xmath32 for which the large - scale magnetic field would be in superequipartition ; this is done in the next . denoting by @xmath33 the alfvn velocity associated with the regular field , we can write @xmath34 . in the likely case that the strength of the large - scale magnetic field does not increase with galactocentric radius it implies @xmath35",
    ". hence , for changes in the rotation velocity of @xmath36 , the regular magnetic field should be above equipartition with the turbulent motions .",
    "the above condition is equivalent to @xmath37 or , in terms of @xmath32 : @xmath38 for @xmath39 km s@xmath1 , variations of @xmath40 km s@xmath1 already require magnetic fields over equipartition .",
    "such a situation is not very appealing to most dynamo theorists .",
    "however , in order to present our results as generic as possible and since there are some observations that could suggest magnetic energy densities above the turbulent ones in the disk of galaxies ( e.g. , beck 2002 , 2003 ) and in the galactic center ( e.g. , moss & shukurov 2001 ) , we will not employ equipartition when discussing the magnetic effects on the rotation curves .",
    "so far , the usual way to proceed was to integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : vphi ] ) out to a certain radius in order to derive the required radial profile for @xmath41 to explain the observed rotation curve @xmath42 , given the volume density at @xmath4 and the gravitational circular velocity ( including a contribution of the dark halo as in snchez - salcedo ( 1997 ) or only the luminous components as in battaner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ) .",
    "the question that arises is whether these local solutions can be matched with boundary conditions at infinity or not .",
    "this issue is very delicate and it will be proven very useful to put bounds on the influence of galactic magnetic fields in the gas dynamics at large scales . before that , however , it is illustrative to describe how galaxies can reach a configuration with a faster rotation in order to have a complete picture of the underlying physics",
    ". this is briefly described in the next subsection .",
    "the assumption that the magnetic field is mainly azimuthal immediately suggests that it commenced to grow after the galactic disk has formed . in the absence of magnetic tension , the _ initial _ galactic disk or protodisk should have a rotation speed given by the mass distribution @xmath43 .",
    "if the rotation curves are significantly affected by the magnetic field , one should expect that , as the magnetic field is amplified no matter by what process , the disk initially in gravitational force balance , will experience a radial contraction caused by the growing magnetic tension , leading to a disk with a faster rotation due to angular momentum conservation .",
    "we will refer to this process as the magnetic contraction phase ( mcp ) .",
    "if the mass loss by outflows is unimportant , the mcp is the only way capable of spinning up the disk because the total angular momentum stored in the fields ( @xmath44\\,dv$ ] ) is negligible in both the initial protodisk and in the final configuration .",
    "other processes , such as turbulent viscosity , are very inefficient to produce the desired effect .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum implies that , for a galaxy similar to the milky way with a dark halo and a rotation speed of @xmath45 km s@xmath1 at @xmath46 kpc , an increase of @xmath30 km s@xmath1 in the velocity speed requires a radial contraction of @xmath47 kpc at that radius",
    ". the contraction must be huge in the magnetic alternative ; see  [ sec : truncation ] .",
    "in the previous section it was pointed out that there is a pinching effect only if @xmath3 does not decrease faster than @xmath48 . however",
    ", this decay is untenable at large @xmath15 in real astrophysical systems as it will be shown in the next and , therefore , it is inevitable that beyond a certain radius , the magnetic tension produces a force pointing outwards ( see fig .  1 for a visualization ) .",
    "in fact , the slowest radial magnetic decay occurs in the ideal case of having strict cylindrical geometry with currents , @xmath49 , flowing from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ( otherwise , if currents are confined to a certain region , @xmath52 must decrease with radius at least as fast as a dipole field for large @xmath53 : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a constant ) . under strict cylindrical geometry , and , hence , the essential physics of the mechanism giving rise to greater azimuthal velocities of the hi disk , is entirely contained within the one - dimensional radial models . ]",
    "the condition of closed current loops is equivalent to imposing @xmath56 at large @xmath15 ( hereafter , this will be our definition of _ isolated system _ in a cylindrical system ) . from ampre s law",
    ", this requirement implies that @xmath57 at large @xmath15 , being @xmath58 a constant . so there must exist a certain radius denoted by @xmath59 at which the magnetic field starts to decay as @xmath48 or faster .",
    "@xmath59 is therefore the radius at which the rotation speed of the gas coincides with the local keplerian velocity . if @xmath60 is the radius of the last point of hi detection , we require @xmath61 in order to have an anomalous faster rotation along the observed disk",
    ".    the system will be in a configuration of equilibrium at @xmath62 only if the inward gravitational force is higher than the outward magnetic force @xmath63 if this condition is not fulfilled the disk will expand radially due to the magnetic forces .",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath64^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : atrest}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the magnetic field strength at @xmath59 . since",
    "a dependence @xmath66 at large @xmath15 is unphysical ( see above ) , an upper limit to @xmath65 can be established from eq .",
    "( [ eq : atrest ] ) : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the radius where @xmath69 . in practice",
    "we will take @xmath70 to estimate the maximum contribution .",
    "the maximum value for @xmath71 corresponds to a situation in which there is balance at @xmath62 between gravitational and magnetic forces and thus the material outside the @xmath59 circle has no rotation at all .",
    "the upper limit derived above has an easy interpretation . in principle",
    ", one could achieve very large differences @xmath32 if one would make the density arbitrarily small than the alfvn speed would be arbitrarily large .",
    "however , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : directbal ] ) , this is not possible globally because the magnetic field has to be held in by the radial weight of the plasma in the radial gravitational field since the net effect of magnetic fields is never confining .",
    "it is customary and natural to discuss this kind of constraints using the virial theorem which says that the net nature of magnetic fields is expansive or null ( but never confining ) in both the radial and vertical directions ( appendix b ) .",
    "more specifically , for toroidal magnetic fields and strict cylindrical geometry , the total rotational energy of an isolated system should be the same with or without magnetic fields , keeping the mass distribution fixed ( so that @xmath72 ; see appendix b for further details ) . by imposing that constraint , a similar upper limit for @xmath73",
    "is found ( appendix c ) , except by a factor ( @xmath74 ) , between @xmath31@xmath75 , that takes into account possible three - dimensional effects .",
    "it is convenient to consider first the extreme and hypothetical case that spiral galaxies do not host dark matter halos . for a galaxy with a mass in gas and stars @xmath76 , @xmath77 in the outer parts and @xmath78 the assumption that @xmath77 is satisfactory for many high surface density galaxies ( e.g. , van albada et al .",
    "1985 ) but it is not necessarily fulfilled in some low surface brightness galaxies ( lsb ) and dwarfs for which the gas surface density is not exponential and its contribution to the potential may be comparable or even higher than that from the stellar component at radii @xmath79 for certain values of the adopted stellar mass - to - luminosity ratio .",
    "however , we are confident that our conclusions would not change for these galaxies even adopting the most unfavorable assumptions .    in the optimistic and rather unlikely situation",
    "that @xmath3 were constant with @xmath15 out to @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath80 at @xmath81 , the characteristic variation @xmath82 would be @xmath83 . by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : upperkep ] ) , it is possible to estimate the maximum relative variation of the circular speed of the gas at a radius @xmath81 : @xmath84 where we have adopted a radial exponential decay for @xmath85 with scale @xmath86 ( e.g. , bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn 1997 ) .",
    "note that @xmath87 is not sensitive to @xmath88 because even though the density at the midplane increases with @xmath88 , equation ( [ eq : ten ] ) does not depend on the absolute value of the density but only on @xmath86 .",
    "the main source of uncertainty stems from the value of @xmath59 , but the most optimistic situation occurs when @xmath89 , so we will assume for the discussion that both radii are identical , @xmath90 kpc for common spiral galaxies . in order to estimate @xmath82 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ten ] ) , we will assume that the mass of gas in the disk beyond @xmath60 and within @xmath91 , being @xmath92 the characteristic scale height of the gas disk ( see appendix c for further details ) , is @xmath93 percent the total mass of the disk .",
    "this seems to be the case of dwarf galaxies ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2001 ) , but it is probably a too generous value for normal spiral galaxies .",
    "the latter assumption corresponds to a radial scale length for the gas , @xmath86 , of @xmath94 kpc . putting these values into eq .",
    "( [ eq : ten ] ) , we obtain @xmath95 at @xmath96 kpc .",
    "if we take for reference values @xmath97 km s@xmath1 at @xmath46 kpc , the maximum change in the rotation velocity , @xmath98 , ranges between @xmath99 to @xmath46 km s@xmath1 for @xmath100 to @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "this value for @xmath101 should be regarded as a generous estimate for two reasons .",
    "first , the azimuthal field is not expected to be approximately constant while the volume density of gas at @xmath4 varies by a factor of @xmath102@xmath103 @xcite .",
    "secondly , the adopted equilibrium configuration , namely @xmath104 at any @xmath62 , can not be reached in practice , starting from a rotating disk in equilibrium with the gravitational force , due to the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "in fact , the magnetic field begins to grow in the disk as discussed in  [ sec : mcp ] , creating a magnetic force directed outward beyond @xmath59 .",
    "this region will undergo a continuous outward drift , while the inner disk ( @xmath81 ) must be subjected to the required contraction phase , generating a gap in the surface density of the disk . in order to quantify this effect ,",
    "we assume for simplicity that the outer disk ( @xmath62 ) suffers an approximately self - similar expansion with factor @xmath105 , i.e. , @xmath106 at @xmath107 , in the final equilibrium configuration . from the conservation of angular momentum",
    ", it can be shown that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ten ] ) is now a factor @xmath108 smaller ( appendix c ) .",
    "hence , the optimized situation occurs for @xmath109 and then @xmath110 at @xmath96 kpc .",
    "this implies that @xmath111 km s@xmath1 at the periphery of hi disks in normal spiral galaxies under the assumption that they contained only stars and the observed gas .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to banish dark halos by magnetic fields because one would require much larger values of @xmath112 .    for disk galaxies with a dark halo , as postulated in the conventional scenario , it is possible to follow the same procedure to estimate the maximum effect of magnetic fields when @xmath113cte , instead of @xmath114 ( see appendix c ) .",
    "similar arguments suggest that the expected local , and probably transient , variations in the rotation speed larger than @xmath115 km s@xmath1 are very unlikely even in models including dark halos ( see also  [ sec : mcp ] and snchez - salcedo 1997 ) .    in the next subsections",
    ", it will be shown that these upper limits for @xmath112 also apply even when galaxies are not isolated systems but are embedded in an ambient medium , thereby making these estimates very robust .",
    "it could be argued that the model described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vphi ] ) is too simplistic because other terms not considered in that equation , as a radial flow or other components of the magnetic field , might be important , regarding the radial confinement , beyond @xmath60 circle , observations suggest that other terms are unimportant for those galaxies under consideration . ] .",
    "in fact , unlike the radial component of the field , the @xmath116-component may contribute to the radial confinement of the disk and will be included in our analysis .",
    "in addition , the hydrodynamical pressure by a radial inflow due to intergalactic accretion of matter may also play a role .",
    "since systems embedded in an ambient medium usually present sharp boundaries , it is convenient to use an integral form of the equations as that given by the virial theorem .    the scalar virial theorem for fields with @xmath26 and strict cylindrical symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) applied to a finite cylindrical volume @xmath118 , bounded by a cylinder @xmath119 of height @xmath120 , can be written as : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the kinetic energy of the gas , @xmath123 its gravitational energy in the gravitational field created by all masses in the system , @xmath19 the gas pressure as defined in ",

    "the subscript @xmath119 refers to quantities valuated at the radial surface of our cylindrical volume with radius @xmath130 , and the subscript ` @xmath131 ' stands for the cylindrical case .",
    "this form for the virial theorem is valid for any arbitrary helical field ( @xmath26 ) provided cylindrical geometry ; no other additional assumption is required . the surface integral terms including the @xmath132 surfaces are taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ eq : magtermtxt ] ) .",
    "the integration of the magnetic terms can be found in appendix b. for any further details in the derivation , we refer the reader to the paper by fiege & pudritz ( 2000 )",
    ".    we can identify two new vias of radial confinement : by ram pressure [ last term of lhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : virialcyltxt ] ) ] or by an external magnetic field . the ambient pressure ( @xmath124 ) , on the other hand , only produces vertical confinement as discussed in appendix a. if these new terms are able to produce radial confinement then the constraint given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : upperlimit ] ) could be somehow relaxed .",
    "the possible role of these terms will be discussed in two separate sections .",
    "so far , we have neglected the terms involving @xmath133 , because hi observations show that @xmath133 is very small compared to @xmath42 for the galaxies under consideration . beyond the edge of the observed hi disk ,",
    "the value of @xmath133 is uncertain .",
    "we consider now the surface integral of the momentum stress in eq .",
    "( [ eq : virialcyltxt ] ) , which may have a negative sign for the case of strong mass accretion into the disk .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that even though @xmath134 is expected to be negative , the combination @xmath135 could be still negative , showing the confining effect of the ram pressure .",
    "( for example , in the one - dimensional case of a supersonic flow that slows down to rest by crashing perpendicularly to a rigid plane wall and forms a strong adiabatic shock , @xmath136 . )    since spherical accretion can not confine a disk , the inflow should be extremely collimated parallel to the galactic plane , i.e.  @xmath137 , for which there is no evidence .",
    "moreover , this collimation is very unlikely to occur if the disk forms from a sphere of gas .",
    "gas cools and parcels of gas acquire circular orbits , conserving approximately angular momentum , when they collapse to settle into a disk , leading to @xmath138 ( see rgnvaldsson 1999 for results based on numerical simulations ) .",
    "furthermore , in the hypothetical case that such inflow were possible by some unknown mechanism , the accretion speed should be so high that an accretion shock would be unavoidable , transforming ram pressure into thermal pressure and probably generating a hydraulic jump in the edge of the disk and other observable features such as h@xmath139 emission .",
    "the hydraulic jump will divert the flow around the disk decreasing dramatically its confinement ability .",
    "a coherent external ( intergalactic ) magnetic field could in principle contribute to the confinement under certain circunstances .",
    "it is important to distinguish here between the intracluster and the wider intergalactic field . as we are dealing with galaxies in the field , we are interested in the amplitude of the latter one . at present , setting observational constraints to the strength and topology of the intergalactic magnetic fields is a challeging task ( see ryu , kang & biermann 1988 ; kronberg et al .  2001 ; and widrow 2002 for a review ) and , therefore , they are very uncertain .",
    "coherent magnetic fields on scales much greater than the typical sizes of galaxies could be as large as @xmath140 @xmath141 g in the optimistic situation that extra amplification through batteries , dynamos or other routes of magnetization were operative .",
    "we assume the ideal situation that initially the pregalactic magnetic field is uniform and fills the protogalaxy making a finite angle @xmath139 with the rotation axis of the galaxy . as the disk is forming by accretion of gas , the magnetic field lines are advected with the flow .",
    "it is well - known in studies of the collapse of interstellar clouds that , under flux - freezing conditions , this compression produces that the total magnetic contribution to the virial theorem is positive ( see , e.g. , chapt .",
    "24 of shu 1992 and chapt .",
    "11 of mestel 1999 ) and , therefore , the confinement by the external field is impeded . in order to have confinement",
    ", the disk must be able to get rid of the magnetic flux .",
    "in the strict cylindrical symmetry , the external magnetic field must be vertical and then eq .",
    "( [ eq : magtermtxt ] ) with @xmath142 tells us that magnetic confinement is only possible if the volume - averaged vertical component of the magnetic field within @xmath118 is strictly smaller than the magnetic field at the boundary .",
    "since @xmath133 is directed inward and @xmath143 in the mcp , @xmath144 increases at every point of the disk due to the inward advection ( see also reyes - ruiz & stepinski 1996 ; moss & shukurov 2001 ) ; under those conditions confinement is not viable .",
    "this problem could be alleviated if magnetic field lines were expelled from the disk by ambipolar and turbulent diffusion .",
    "however , a thorough numerical study by @xcite shows that @xmath144 is also increased by ambipolar shearing terms to a value considerably larger than its initial value . in the lack of a mechanism able to reduce @xmath144 within disks ,",
    "pregalactic magnetic fields do not help to confine galactic disks .",
    "this example clearly illustrates why self - confinement is so rare in nature .",
    "models based on the confinement by anchored fields to the galactic nucleus will present a similar problem , as @xmath144 is expected to decline outwards .",
    "battaner & florido ( 1995 , 2000 ) and battaner , florido & jimnez - vicente ( 2002 ) pointed out that : ( 1 ) the magnetic alternative to dark halos does not suffer from the problem of excessive flaring of the hi disk and ( 2 ) the existence of truncated stellar disks is explained satisfactorily in the magnetic alternative .",
    "putting aside the problem of radial confinement discussed in the previous sections , it is stimulating to see whether alternative scenarios to conventional ideas have the potential of explaining other phenomena in a natural way .",
    "if this occurs , alternative models could attrack much more attention .",
    "for instance , some empirical correlations of galactic warps have led to castro - rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to suggest tentatively that outer rotation curves could not be caused by the presence of a massive halo . in the next sections we will show that the flaring problem remains unsolved and that the existence of truncated stellar disks can not be considered a prediction of the magnetic alternative .",
    "if galaxies contained only stars and the observed gas , the initial protodisk of mass @xmath145 should follow approximately a keplerian rotation , @xmath146 , at large @xmath15 , and evolves to the present - day exponential disk of mass @xmath147 and radial scale length @xmath148 , due to magnetic contraction .",
    "the peak velocity of the final disk is @xmath149 ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for simplicity , we assume that beyond @xmath150 the rotation curve of a present galaxy is flat with circular velocity @xmath151 . during the mcp",
    ", a ring of gas located initially at a radius @xmath152 must squeeze up to a final radius @xmath153 , such as @xmath154 from angular momentum conservation . therefore , the initial radius is given by the simple expression @xmath155 . for a normal spiral galaxy like the milky way , with a nearly flat rotation curve up to the last measured point , typically at @xmath156 kpc , and with @xmath157 kpc",
    ", the mcp should be able to squeeze the disk at least from @xmath158 kpc to @xmath156 kpc in radius , provided the mass loss in outflows is negligible , corresponding to a typical radial velocity of @xmath159 km s@xmath1 for one hubble time . according to  [ sec : core ] , this contraction is an unfeasible process due to the global expansive nature of magnetic fields .    the level of contraction may be significantly reduced if a substantial fraction of the mass is lost in winds following early epoch of star bursts , i.e.  @xmath160 .",
    "recently , @xcite has estimated that less than @xmath161 of the total mass of the galaxy has been lost during its lifetime . even assuming an amount of mass loss @xmath159 times larger than this value , the magnitude of the contraction of the disk is still huge , from @xmath162 kpc to @xmath46 kpc , again for @xmath163 kpc .",
    "the mcp represents a serious threat to the suggestion by @xcite that , since stars do not feel the galactic magnetic field , the escape of stars formed beyond a certain galactocentric radius could explain the observed truncation of stellar disks .",
    "the calculations by battaner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are rooted in a scenario that does not consider the mcp , with the gas disks being in anomalous rotation from the very beginning . if one tries to include the mcp in the model , the stellar distribution function depends on different assumptions that concern the details of the mcp , such as the radial velocity of the contraction , or the relationship between star formation rate , surface density and magnetic field strength .",
    "consequently , the escape radius depends on time .",
    "if the disk was contracted from @xmath164 to @xmath46 kpc in radius , it could be even more natural to construct a model in which the stellar surface density decays with @xmath15 slowly enough , with no stellar truncation radius .    even assuming that stars in the outer disk were not formed until the gas disk stopped its contraction , which is in contrast with observations that show old stars in the outer disk ( e.g. , ferguson & johnson 2001 ) , the planar velocity dispersions of the stars should increase dramatically with @xmath15 and this is not observed ( e.g. , pfenniger et al .",
    "1994 ; valle 1994 ) .      in the past years ,",
    "much of the challenge involved in making the magnetic alternative viable concerned the excessive flaring of the disk , which is caused by the vertical magnetic pressure @xcite . in a two - dimensional analysis ,",
    "@xcite predict a scale height of @xmath159@xmath165 kpc at a radius of @xmath99 kpc and of @xmath166 kpc at @xmath46 kpc for the hi disk of m31 .",
    "these values are still too large by a factor of @xmath159@xmath167 if comparing with the observed hi scale height observed in the galaxy by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy in the scale height is the least of our worries .",
    "an inspection of the radial profile of the magnetic strength ( fig .  3 of battaner & florido 1995 ) reveals that there is something deeply wrong in their calculations . as shown in ",
    "[ sec : oned ] , the magnetic field can not decrease faster than @xmath48 in order to have a disk with a faster rotation .",
    "therefore , a magnetic field of @xmath168 g at @xmath99 kpc implies a field strength larger than @xmath169 g at @xmath46 kpc .",
    "the magnetic field estimated by @xcite decays faster than @xmath48 .",
    "if the dark matter contribution to the rotation curve is null , the required magnetic fields in the outer parts of typical spiral galaxies are so intense ( @xmath170@xmath171 g ) that the problem of excessive flaring is unresolved .",
    "the flaring problem is exacerbated when the magnetic pressure of the small - scale magnetic field is included because it also contributes to the vertical expansion of the disk .",
    "this pressure is observed to be comparable to the magnetic pressure of the regular field at least in the optical disk of the galaxy . on the other hand , the excessive flaring is also aggravated if the magnetic pitch angle is not zero .",
    "_ we conclude that the flaring problem by itself is sufficient to reject the magnetic alternative . _",
    "in this section , we will discuss the role of magnetic fields as a remedy for the cuspy problem of dark halos .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the magnetic pressure of the random component , as well as certain configurations of a global - scale magnetic field ( not necessarily azimuthal ) could help to explain the discrepancy between the profiles of dark halos obtained in cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations , which becomes very cuspy towards the center ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1996 , 1997 ) , and observations of the halos of dwarf galaxies and lsb , which are better fitted with a core - dominated halo ( see de blok , bosma & mcgaugh 2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "one possibility is that galaxies are indeed embedded in cuspy halos following the profile found by navarro , frenk and white ( 1996 ; hereafter nfw ) but the combination of asymmetric drifts and magnetic effects wipe out completely the inner cusp , leading to rotation curves that mimic a halo with a core .",
    "the magnetic pressure of the random component gives some support to the disk , reducing the rotation speed .",
    "since it is expected to be in equipartition with the gas turbulent pressure , corrections due to the magnetic pressure should be of the order of the asymmetric drift , @xmath172@xmath159 km s@xmath1 ( e.g. , de blok & bosma 2002 ) , which are smaller or comparable to observational uncertainties , typically @xmath173@xmath174 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this contribution , however , could be larger in a certain radial portion of the disk if the magnetic pressure decays faster than @xmath28 . writting the alfvn speed associated to the random field as @xmath175 , with the turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath28 constant with @xmath15 , and @xmath176 , the rotation curve changes according to the relation : @xmath177 following @xcite , we define @xmath178 as the radius of the innermost sampled point of the rotation curve , and assume that at @xmath179 , @xmath180 for simplicity .",
    "doing so , we are imposing that at @xmath178 , @xmath181 .",
    "the second term of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : drift ] ) is of the order of the asymmetric drift ( comparable to observational uncertainties ) , whereas the last term is @xmath182 . as the observed rotation curve differs from the nfw profile along a significant range of galactocentric radius ,",
    "say at @xmath183 pc , then @xmath184 , implying that @xmath185 km@xmath186 s@xmath187 ( for @xmath188 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "consequently , this effect would be only significant very close to the galactic center where @xmath189 km s@xmath1 , a region with large observational uncertainties .",
    "summing up , the contribution from the total pressure to the circular velocity is less than @xmath167@xmath174 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this result agrees with the fact that co , h@xmath190 and hi rotation curves reveal the same kinematics for the central regions of some galaxies ( e.g. , bolatto et al .",
    "2002 ) , which suggests that magnetic fields do not contribute significantly to the support of the gas disks .",
    "in particular , the co rotation curves are expected to trace the motion of the highest density regions , including molecular clouds , which are thought to be hardly affected by the galactic magnetic fields .    in conclusion ,",
    "magnetic effects are not sufficient to solve the cuspy halo problem satisfactorily .",
    "it has been recognized for decades that the galactic magnetic field provides significant vertical support to the interstellar medium .",
    "the role of the magnetic tension in the vertical hydrostatic configuration was considered by @xcite and @xcite , whereas the role of the tension in the plane of the disk was studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite [ see also piddington 1964 ] .",
    "the idea that large - scale magnetic fields can explain the rotation curves of spirals without invoking dark matter has been revived by @xcite and battaner et al .  ( 2002 ) .",
    "all the previous work aimed at giving bounds to magnetic effects on gas dynamics are based on the flaring of the disk by the vertical magnetic gradients . here",
    "we propose that the radial analysis provides stringent constraints , being free of other complicated assumptions such as the unknown external pressure .",
    "we have shown that magnetic fields have a net expansive ( or null , but never confining ) effect _ not only _ in the vertical direction but also in the radial direction . without dark matter halos ,",
    "the contribution of the magnetic field to the rotation curves at the periphery of spiral galaxies is not expected to be larger than @xmath30 km s@xmath1 , which is insufficient to banish dark halos by magnetic fields .",
    "this result is valid even though an external pressure , intergalactic magnetic fields or ram pressure are taken into account .",
    "in addition , the huge contraction of the disk required in the magnetic alternative would spoil a simple magnetic explanation for the observed truncation of stellar disks .",
    "moreover , the problem of excessive flaring in the outer disk by the magnetic pressure is unresolved and may be aggravated if the random component of the magnetic field is included , or if the field is not purely toroidal .",
    "by contrast , there is observational evidence that the dwarf , dark - matter dominated galaxy ic 2574 does not possess a dynamically - important galactic - scale magnetic field .",
    "our first conclusion is that the magnetic alternative is not viable .",
    "even though there is no doubt about the existence of dark matter halos around galaxies , it is desirable to constrain the magnetic effects on the hi rotation curves for a correct interpretation of the observations .",
    "it is suggested that magnetic fields can contribute to produce wiggles in the hi rotation curves , which could be likely associated with non - axisymmetric waves in the disk , as may be the case of ngc 1560 .",
    "however , the magnetic tension is unlikely to produce substructure in the rotation curve of massive spiral galaxies above @xmath2 km s@xmath1 . in @xcite , the detailed shape of the rotation curve of this dwarf galaxy",
    "was fitted reasonably well combining a magnetic field of strength @xmath191",
    "@xmath141 g plus an isothermal dark halo .",

    "the thermal energy is negligible compared to the kinetic energy .",

    "<S> the density profiles of dark halos are usually inferred from the rotation curves of disk galaxies based on the assumption that the gas is a good tracer of the gravitational potential of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> some authors have suggested that magnetic pinching forces could alter significantly the rotation curves of spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to other studies which have concentrated in the vertical structure of the disk , here we focus on the problem of magnetic confinement in the radial direction to bound the magnetic effects on the hi rotation curves . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that azimuthal magnetic fields can hardly speed up the hi disk of galaxies as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , based on virial constraints we show that the contribution of galactic magnetic fields to the rotation curves can not be larger than @xmath0 km s@xmath1 at the outermost point of hi detection , if the galaxies did not contain dark matter at all , and up to @xmath2 km s@xmath1 in the conventional dark halo scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure to estimate the maximum effect of magnetic fields is general and applicable to any particular galaxy disk . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the surface terms , namely the intergalactic ( thermal , magnetic or ram ) pressure , does not change our conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> other problems related with the magnetic alternative to dark halos are highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of magnetic fields in the cuspy problem of dark halos is also discussed . </S>"
