    "the evolution of galaxies is driven by the intricate power play between interstellar turbulence and gravity controlling the formation of stars in giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the rate at which stars form is hence a pivotal quantity in tracing a galaxy s fundamental properties and distribution of matter and activity .",
    "nonetheless , the functional dependence of the column density of star formation ( @xmath0 ) has been a highly debated topic for more than two decades , with historical parameterizations including the mean column density of available gas ( @xmath1 ) @xcite , as well as the ratio between @xmath1 and the mean freefall time @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , significant scatter remains in both these approaches , such that @xmath0 can vary by more than an order of magnitude for any given input @xmath1 or @xmath4 .",
    "follow - up analyses of these theoretical models via computer simulations have determined that the observed scatter may be primarily attributed to the physical variations in the sonic mach number ( @xmath5 ) of the turbulence in the star - forming clouds @xcite .",
    "this results in separate @xmath5-dependent relations for the sfr , which cover the observed range of @xmath0 .",
    "the aim of this work is hence to unify these separate laws and develop a unique , universal relation .    in section  [",
    "sec : theory ] we introduce and derive our new sf law based on the pdf and mach number of interstellar turbulence .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes the observational sample utilized to assess our new sf law . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our findings and compare our new model to previous parameterizations . in section  [ sec : appl ] we invert our new sf law to make sonic mach number predictions for extragalactic sources .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "here we derive an improved sf law , which takes into account the distribution of gas densities ( pdf ) present in galactic clouds and the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this follows from the finding that the observed scatter in the sf law can be principally attributed to the variation in the sonic mach number of the clouds and galaxies observed @xcite .      in 2012",
    "krumholz , dekel and mckee initiated the refinement of the traditional kennicutt - schmidt law by dividing the gas surface density by the freefall time of the gas ( @xmath4 ) , indeed achieving a stark improvement in star formation rate correlation @xcite .",
    "however , because this model implements only the division between the _ average _ surface density and the _ average _ freefall time of the gas , important information regarding the wide distribution of densities within the ism and molecular clouds @xcite is not taken into account .",
    "we hence extend upon the important previous work by @xcite to incorporate the density pdf , with the ultimate goal of eliminating the remaining scatter in the previous relation .    in our new sf law , we must consider the fact that denser gas forms stars at a higher rate @xcite because gas with higher density @xmath6 has a shorter freefall time than more diffuse gas , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant . note that the concept of a multi - freefall time was pioneered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it suggests that , due to the clumpy nature of molecular clouds , the typical timescale for star formation is not the average timescale of the clouds , but the _ density - dependent _ timescale of each collapsing substructure within the clouds .",
    "this _ multi - freefall concept _ has recently received support from numerical simulations in @xcite and from observations in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite and @xcite had only correlated @xmath0 with @xmath9 ( hereby denoted as @xmath10 ) ; i.e. only at a _ single _ freefall time evaluated at the mean density @xmath11 .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that the true correlation must be in the form of an integral over the whole density pdf , @xmath12\\,p_\\rho d\\rho$ ] . in the following ,",
    "we compute this integral by making the standard assumption that the pdf follows a log - normal distribution as the initial condition for star formation , @xmath13 where the density is written in logarithmic form , normalized to the mean density @xmath14 this transformation of variables from @xmath6 to @xmath15 has advantages during the integration step below and allows us to write the pdf , equation  ( [ eq : pdf ] ) , in its standard log - normal form .",
    "the mean logarithmic density @xmath16 is related to the variance @xmath17 by @xmath18 @xcite . as derived by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the logarithmic density variance is given by @xmath19 parameterized by the sonic mach number @xmath5 , the turbulent driving parameter @xmath20 @xcite , and the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure , plasma @xmath21 .",
    "the log - normal pdf , equation  ( [ eq : pdf ] ) , and the associated density variance ",
    "mach number relation , equation  ( [ eq : sigs ] ) , are observed to provide a good approximation to the real pdf in molecular clouds @xcite , in the galactic centre @xcite , on large galactic scales @xcite , and even in extra - galactic systems @xcite .      for a rigorous derivation , we start by defining a cartesian coordinate system in which the line - of - sight toward the cloud or galaxy is in the @xmath22-direction and maps of column density and star formation rate surface density are in the @xmath23-plane .",
    "first , the gas column density is defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the scale height of the cloud or galaxy for which @xmath1 is to be determined . from observations and simulations discussed in the previous section , we know that @xmath1 and @xmath6 follow closely a log - normal distribution , equation  ( [ eq : pdf ] ) .",
    "thus , in order to compute an average of a density - dependent variable , we simply have to integrate that variable over the entire pdf .",
    "for the average gas column density , for example , we would evaluate @xmath26 , which is indeed the average column density @xmath27 .",
    "now we follow exactly the same mathematical procedure , but for the combined density - dependent variable @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 note that in the second step , we use the exact scaling @xmath30 , because @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the third step transforms variables from @xmath6 to @xmath15 via equation  ( [ eq : s ] ) and via the identity @xmath33 .",
    "the last step , equation  ( [ eq : sol ] ) , is the analytic solution of the integral over all densities .",
    "we call this new quantity derived above , the _ maximum gas consumption rate _ or _ multi - freefall gas consumption rate _ ( mgcr ) , denoted @xmath34 .",
    "we see that equation  ( [ eq : sol ] ) includes the multi - freefall correction factor given by @xmath35 , which corrects the single - freefall average @xmath36 used in @xcite and @xcite for the underlying pdf of densities .",
    "we can now insert the density variance from equation  ( [ eq : sigs ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : sol ] ) and obtain the multi - freefall correction factor , @xmath37    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     * notes .",

    "column  3 : galaxy type .",
    "column  4 : geometric mean @xmath5 prediction from inverting the improved sf law , equation  ( [ eq : newsflaw ] ) , as well as the upper and lower limits of this @xmath5 estimate .",
    "[ tab : appl ]    the @xcite sf law had utilized extragalactic data of disk and starburst galaxies @xcite in addition to milky way observations .",
    "however , it is difficult to accurately gauge the values of @xmath5 for extragalactic sources as we are not able to well resolve individual molecular clouds , especially at high redshifts .",
    "@xmath5 estimates require measurements of the sound speed and turbulent velocity dispersion of a cloud , which in turn requires high - resolution molecular line data and a temperature measurement .",
    "such data are hard to obtain for molecular clouds in external galaxies , as a complete census of the star - forming molecular cloud population in a given galaxy is needed at sufficiently high resolution to capture the cloud - scale mach number .",
    "there are only very few studies of nearby galaxies ( such as m51 ) which start to resolve molecular clouds in external galaxies @xcite , but even those do not necessarily yield a complete census of clouds and it is not clear that all cloud properties are converged at the telescope resolutions available to date",
    ".    we were hence unable to include extragalactic sources that lack @xmath5 estimates in the deduction of our new sf law .",
    "they were similarly omitted in our analysis of previous laws in order to arrive at a fair comparison between the different parameterizations of @xmath0 in figure  [ fig : sflaws ] and table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "instead , we invert our new model , equation  ( [ eq : newsflaw ] ) , in order to compute @xmath5 estimates for these extragalactic sources ; predictions to be tested by future observations of resolved co maps in extragalactic sources .",
    "our @xmath5 predictions are summarized in table  [ tab : appl ] .",
    "since the presence of vigorous star formation in starburst galaxies would result in more violent turbulence of gas compared to disk galaxies , it is expected that the starburst galaxies have greater @xmath5 than their disk galaxy counterparts of the same redshift range , which is indeed the systematic trend we find in table  [ tab : appl ] .",
    "this trend is consistent with the analyses and conclusions presented in @xcite .",
    "we derived a new sf law given by equation  ( [ eq : newsflaw ] ) , which is based primarily on the sonic mach number of turbulence , as a result of the density pdf of molecular , star - forming gas clouds .",
    "we find that the sfr is equal to @xmath38 of the _ maximum ( multi - freefall ) gas consumption rate _ ( mgcr ) , which we derived in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "we compared our new model to previous parameterizations of the sfr and determined quantitatively that our new sf law provides a tight linear relation between @xmath0 and mgcr , with a factor of 34 less scatter compared to any previous sf law . by inverting equation  ( [ eq : newsflaw ] )",
    ", we predict the mach numbers ( @xmath5 ) of the star - forming molecular clouds in extragalactic sources .",
    "our predictions are summarized in table  [ tab : appl ] , which anticipate testing via future submillimetre observations .",
