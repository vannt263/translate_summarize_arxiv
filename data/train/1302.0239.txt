    "the evolution of the number of collisions as a function of time is a probe of the reaction mechanism .",
    "this number increases during the initial stage of the collision , which is a phase of compression .",
    "a stage of dilution follows , characterised by a drop of the number of collisions .",
    "the trend then reaches a minimum and inverses signing the beginning of the process of fragment formation , characterised by an initial increase of the number of collisions and a successive stabilisation and levelling off due to the separation of the fragments .",
    "this figure shows that , as expected , the number of attempted collisions per test particle averaged over a statistics of dynamical trajectories should not differ in the present formalism with respect to a conventional buu approach when the initial rising side of the spectrum is considered . on the other hand , the amplitude of the fluctuation marks the difference between the two models . in correspondence with the phase of dilution ( around 80 - 120 fm / c ) , fluctuations characterise not only the statistics of collisions but also the kinematics .",

    "all these effects are even further enhanced when moving from smf with @xmath22 to blob , but in the latter case the dependence on @xmath24 disappears , as expected , because in blob a fluctuation - source term , corresponding to the boltzmann - langevin collision integral , has been implemented .",

    "@xcite , the effective - collision probability is weighted on the blocking factors of the destination sites , taking into account the full extension of the initial distributions . in blob , distributions are adapted to the occupation profile by the use of a numerical optimisation procedure .",
    "this latter converges first to the appropriate extension of the scattered regions ( by expanding initial and final sites in momentum space ) and then converges to the appropriate test - particle final distribution by reorganising the scattered test particles according to packets which can be modulated in shape ; the principle of this method is shown in fig .",

    "the number of effective collisions drops to smaller values with respect to the number of attempted collisions .",
    "the evolution of the effective - collision number is not expected to be identical for smf and blob calculations ; the number is reduced with respect to the attempted - collision spectrum , keeping the shape mostly unchanged , but the effective collisions result more penalised by the pauli blocking treatment in blob then in smf . on the one hand , this difference comes from the fact that the pauli blocking is applied to the scattering of test - particle couples in smf , while in blob it is applied to extended distributions of test particles . on the other hand ,",
    "it is important to remark that in blob the number of effective collisions is reduced with respect to smf but in this latter case collisions are more efficient in producing phase - space fluctuations .",
    "moreover , in the blob calculation the fluctuation is not gradually amplified ( the smf approach results in amplifying the most unstable mode ) but it presents large and correct amplitudes since the initial instants : this favours the early appearing of bifurcations and explains the earlier fragment formation and the larger kinetic energy of the fragments . as a further outcome",

    "the fragment configuration is more isotropic in the blob simulation , this could be due to a larger transparency .",

    "in the present example we find that in the smf calculation one trajectory prevails ( leading to fusion ) , while in the blob calculation a more complete phase - space sampling allows to access a variety of exit - channel configurations ( from fusion to fragmentation ) .",
    "the differences between blob and smf appear in the statistics of collisions as well as in the kinematics .    in this context , the study of a new strategy to solve the boltzmann - langevin equation is presented . as an extension of the bauer - bertsch approach , in the framework of semiclassical test - particle - based transport models , fluctuations of correct amplitude",

    "the resulting fluctuations have so large amplitude to induce bifurcations in the dynamical paths of the one - body phase - space density and they correlate over smaller volumes with respect to previous forms of the collision integral . in prospective , this strategy is promising for the improvement of transport models for nuclear collisions and for the implementation of isovector effects in the collision dynamics .",
