    "when reionization was complete and what kind of sources should be responsible for it still remain open questions .",
    "the optical depth of electron scattering constrained from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) infers that the universe was substantially ionized by @xmath3 @xcite , which is somewhat in conflict with the gunn - peterson trough in the spectra of high - redshift quasars implying an end to reionization at @xmath4 .",
    "models which are consistent with these constrains strongly suggest that reionization is likely to be a much more extended process @xcite .",
    "in addition , observations of the ly @xmath5 forest and the high - redshift galaxies at @xmath6 infer a photon - starved end to reionization @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that small galaxies forming in the dark matter halos with masses below @xmath7 produce the bulk of ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization .",
    "however , these galaxies are too faint to be detected by the current observational facilities .",
    "even the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) will be incapable of reaching the required sensitivity . fortunately , long gamma - ray burst ( lgrb ) observations offer a unique opportunity for probing the history of the high - redshift star formation , unlimited by the faintness of the host galaxy .    as a result of the collapse of massive stars @xcite ,",
    "lgrbs are thought to be well suited to investigate the cosmic star formation rate ( csfr ) @xcite .",
    "still , this is challenging , because detailed modeling is required to connect the lgrb rate to the csfr . in this respect , whether or not lgrbs are biased tracers of star formation is highly debated @xcite .",
    "earlier studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) often modeled the relation between the lgrb rate and the csfr using a redshift dependence quantity which is parameterized as a simple power law , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "a possible physical explanation for such an enhancement is the cosmic metallicity evolution , because the collapsar model for lgrbs suggests that they can only be produced by stars with metallicity @xmath10 .",
    "observationally , @xcite and @xcite found that lgrbs at @xmath11 occur preferentially in relatively low - mass , low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "however , the picture is not a simple one : several lgrb hosts with high - metallicity have been found @xcite , which suggests that a low - metallicity cut - off is unlikely . compiling a large sample of 46 lgrbs over @xmath12",
    ", @xcite found that the properties of their host galaxies are those expected for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "most recently , by analyzing a sample of 22 lgrb hosts with new radio data , @xcite have found that the properties of lgrb population are consistent with those of other star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 , implying that lgrbs trace a large fraction of all star formation .",
    "hence , owing to the limited sample size , the biases of the lgrb hosts in terms of morphology and metallicity are far from being well understood .    in this work",
    "we investigate the effect of the evolution of cosmic metallicity placed on the csfr - lgrb rate connection using an extensive sample of lgrbs compiled by @xcite together with several csfr models , including empirical models fitted from the observational data as well as a self - consistent model derived from the hierarchical formation scenario using a press - schechter - like formalism .",
    "this analysis could also be used for a better estimate of the high - redshift csfr using the lgrb rate as the observational data .",
    "furthermore , this work could contribute to the study of the environments of lgrb host galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the csfr and lgrb rate models are explained in section  2 . in section  3 ,",
    "we compare the predictions of the different models with the observed cumulative redshift distribution of lgrbs .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  4 .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in this paper are from the wmap-7 results : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in order to successfully produce a lgrb with a collapsar , the progenitor star has to be sufficiently massive to result in the formation of a central black hole @xcite .",
    "then the relationship between the intrinsic lgrb rate and the black hole formation rate can be parameterized as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the black hole formation rate and @xmath20 is the redshift - dependent lgrb formation efficiency that can be used to model possible biases in the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that @xmath23 was inconsistent with the observational data , implying that there is an enhancement in the lgrb rate by some mechanism at high redshift .",
    "as suggested by the collapsar model @xcite , the most likely physical explanation for this enhancement is the cosmic metallicity evolution , which has been explored by many authors @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite explored a scenario in which lgrbs arise in metal - poor host galaxies , resulting in a metallicity cut of @xmath10 . following @xcite ( ln ) , in the case where lgrbs preferentially occur in galaxies with low - metallicity",
    ", the lgrb formation efficiency can be described by an analytical form for the fraction of mass density belonging to metallicity below a given threshold of @xmath24 : @xmath25}{\\gamma(\\alpha_{1}+2)},\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the incomplete and complete gamma functions , @xmath28 is the slope in the schechter distribution function of galaxy stellar masses @xcite and @xmath29 is the power - law index of the galaxy mass - metallicity relation .",
    "it is worth stressing that this analytical form is based on a schechter function of galaxy stellar masses from @xcite and the linear bisector fit to the mass - metallicity relation derived by @xcite , of the form @xmath30 .",
    "ln did not address the redshift evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function , and assumed that the average cosmic metallicity simply evolves with redshift according to @xmath31 , which is from the metallicity measurements of emission - line galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the validity of these simplifications needs to be examined .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the redshift evolution of the average metallicity below . given the scaling @xmath32 @xcite , the redshift - dependent mass - metallicity relation derived by @xcite can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hubble time in units of gyr and @xmath35 is the galaxy stellar mass in units of @xmath36 . equation  ( [ eq ] ) then can be used to calculate the average metallicity which is defined by averaging over the stellar mass @xmath37 by adopting a redshift evolving stellar mass function from @xcite , @xmath38 @xmath39 is calculated and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , with comparison to the measurements from @xcite .",
    "the result of @xmath39 with the non - evolving stellar mass function from @xcite is also shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "as can be seen , the redshift evolution of the metallicity according to @xmath31 evolves more rapidly to lower metallicity with increasing redshift than that of @xmath39 with both the evolving and the non - evolving stellar mass function .",
    "this is because that the contribution to @xmath39 is dominated by galaxies with stellar masses around @xmath40 while faster evolution and lower metallicity are primarily due to galaxies with smaller stellar masses @xcite .",
    "however , due to the limited number of lgrbs with measured redshifts and many uncertain biases , such as their selection effects , evolving luminosity function , the evolving stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , for our purpose , it is enough to adopt the analytical form of ln in this paper .    .",
