    "with the increasing deployment and growing importance of cyber - physical systems , the question of their security has recently become a focus of research activity in control theory @xcite .",
    "one central vulnerability of networked control or estimation is the communication channel between plant and controller / estimator and possibly the feedback channel from the controller to the plant .",
    "a possible attack on the channels is to actively interfere with transmitted information with the goal of degrading the control or estimation performance .",
    "however , if the state of a plant is estimated remotely , e.g. , in order to decide on the next control action at a remote controller , another possible attack is eavesdropping .",
    "an adversary might have the chance to overhear the transmitted information , to make its own system estimate and thus obtain sensitive information .",
    "this paper addresses the question of what can be done to protect the transmitted information from such an attacker .",
    "we consider an unstable scalar , discrete - time , time - invariant linear system subject to nonstochastic disturbances , where both the initial state and the disturbances are arbitrary elements of a bounded interval .",
    "estimator _ has the goal of estimating the system states in such a way that the supremum over time of the absolute differences between the true state and its estimate is bounded uniformly over all possible system state trajectories .",
    "we call this _ reliability_. the estimator does not have direct access to the system states .",
    "instead , an _ encoder _ observes the system state and is linked to the estimator through an _",
    "uncertain channel _ , where every input is disturbed in a nonstochastic manner and the input and output alphabets are possibly finite .",
    "the encoder transforms blocks of state observations into codewords , while the estimator applies the channel outputs for estimating the system states .    through another , different , uncertain channel , an adversary called the _ eavesdropper _ obtains a disturbed version of the encoder s channel input and hence information about the system state .",
    "in addition to reliability , our goal is to make the information transmission from the encoder to the estimator secure in such a way that the eavesdropper obtains as little information as possible about the system state .",
    "the main question of this paper is under which conditions there exists a transmission scheme such that reliability and security are achieved simultaneously .",
    "_ contributions : _ we introduce the _ uncertain wiretap channel _ , defined as the pair consisting of the uncertain channel from the encoder to the estimator and the uncertain channel from the encoder to the eavesdropper .",
    "we also define the _ zero - error secrecy capacity _ of the uncertain wiretap channel , which describes the maximal block encoding data rate such that not only the estimator can decode the transmitted message , but at the same time the eavesdropper always has at least two messages among which it can not distinguish which one was actually transmitted .",
    "we show that it either equals zero or the zero - error capacity of the uncertain channel between encoder and estimator introduced by shannon @xcite , i.e. , the maximal rate at which , using block encoding , data can be transmitted from the encoder to the estimator through the uncertain channel in such a way that every possible channel output is generated by a unique message .",
    "a general criterion to distinguish the two cases can be given in a special case .",
    "for the study of the zero - error secrecy capacity of uncertain wiretap channels , we introduce a hypergraph structure on the input alphabet in addition to the graph structure which is applied in the study of the zero - error capacity of uncertain channels and which also goes back to shannon @xcite .    with these information - theoretic tools",
    ", we address the main question formulated above .",
    "we define two security criteria for secure estimation .",
    "the first , called _ d - security _ , is that there is no possibility for the eavesdropper to process the data it receives in order to obtain a bounded estimation error .",
    "the other security criterion is _ v - security _ , which requires that the volume of the set of system states at a given time which are possible according to the eavesdropper s information should tend to infinity .",
    "we identify a sufficient condition which says that reliability and both d- and v - security are achievable if the zero - error secrecy capacity of the uncertain wiretap channel is strictly larger than the logarithm of the coefficient of the unstable system .",
    "we also give bounds on the speed of growth of the eavesdropper s estimation error and of the volume of the set of states at a given time which are possible according to the eavesdropper s information .",
    "a necessary condition for the simultaneous achievability of reliability , d- and v - security can be given for a subclass of uncertain wiretap channels .",
    "_ related work : _ good overviews over the area of estimation and control under information constraints can be found in the introduction of @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "matveev and savkin @xcite proved that if the system and channel disturbances are stochastic and the estimator s goal is to obtain an almost surely bounded estimation error , the crucial property of the channel is its shannon zero - error capacity .",
    "this led nair @xcite to introduce a nonstochastic information theory for studying the zero - error capacity of uncertain channels and to consider the problem of estimation and control of linear unstable systems , where the information between sensor and estimator has to be transmitted over an uncertain channel .",
    "there exists a large body of work on information - theoretically secure communication , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "stochastic wiretap channels were introduced by @xcite .",
    "security in the context of estimation and control has so far mostly meant security against active adversaries , e.g. , in @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "only @xcite and @xcite have combined estimation and security against a passive adversary for an unstable system so far .",
    "@xcite considers general stochastic disturbances in the system and a stochastic wiretap channel with gaussian noise and uses a non - operational security criterion based on entropy whose implications are not immediately clear . @xcite considers a linear system with gaussian disturbances and gaussian observation noise , whereas the stochastic wiretap channel randomly and independently deletes input symbols . as a security criterion , @xcite requires that the eavesdropper s estimation error tends to infinity .",
    "uncertain channels were introduced by nair @xcite , but were previously considered implicitly in the study of the zero - error capacity of channels with stochastic disturbances as introduced by shannon @xcite .",

    "[ fig : grhyp ] .      theorem [ thm : injch ] will follow from a slightly more general lemma which holds for general wiretap channels .",
    "this lemma analyzes a procedure , to be presented next , which eliminates elements @xmath487 from @xmath83 which do not satisfy a necessary condition for being a codeword of a zero - error wiretap code .",
    "the idea behind the procedure is that by lemma [ lem : zecrit ] no @xmath488 can be a codeword which is contained in an @xmath480 which is a singleton or where all elements of @xmath475 are connected in @xmath482 .",
    "thus these elements can be neglected when looking for a zero - error wiretap code .",
    "this amounts to deleting those elements from the input alphabet and to restricting the wiretap channel to the reduced alphabet .",
