    "the distribution of galaxies in redshift surveys reveals vast regions of space that seem to be avoided by galaxies . these are termed voids , although voids may not be completely empty , but may harbor a few isolated galaxies . during the 1970 s ,",
    "the use of galaxy redshift surveys to trace the large scale structure began in earnest .",
    "gregory & thompson ( 1978 ) showed evidence for the existence of superclusters and void regions with radii larger than 20@xmath0mpckm s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ] using pencil beam surveys directed toward the coma and perseus cluster .",
    "einasto , joeveer & saar ( 1980 ) discuss the chain - like distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters and the existence of empty cell structures .",
    "kirshner et al . ( 1981 ) discovered a void in botes that is 50@xmath0mpc in diameter .",
    "the ubiquity of voids and their importance in the large scale distribution of galaxies was first clearly shown by results from the center for astrophysics surveys ( davis et al .",
    "1992 ; de lapparent , geller , & huchra 1986 ; geller & huchra 1989 ) and the southern sky redshift survey ( da costa et al .",
    "1988 , 1994 ; maurogordato et al .",
    "subsequent larger surveys at a variety of wavelengths have confirmed these results and have shown that no larger voids are seen at similar density contrast .",
    "see the review article by rood ( 1998 ) and references therein for a discussion of the history of void detection and interpretation .",
    "voids appear to have little or no structure within them .",
    "peebles ( 2001 ) discusses an apparent discrepancy between the cold dark matter model and observations .",
    "the cold dark matter model predicts that there should be matter and , hence galaxies , primarily dwarfs , within voids ( dekel & silk 1986 ; hoffman , silk & wyse 1992 ) .",
    "however , studies of different types of galaxies show that they all seem to trace the same structures .",
    "grogin & geller ( 1999 , 2000 ) identify a sample of void galaxies in the cfa2 survey and find evidence for environmental dependence of galaxy properties , although most of these galaxies in this sample avoid the centers of the voids .",
    "surveys of dwarf galaxies indicate that they trace the same overall structures as ` normal ' galaxies ( bingelli 1989 ) and pointed observations toward void regions also fail to detect a significant population of faint galaxies ( kuhn , hopp & elssser 1997 ; popescu , hopp & elssser 1997 ) , consistent with the widely observed result that galaxies have common voids regardless of hubble type ( e.g. thuan , gott & schneider 1987 ; babul & postman 1990 ; mo , mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ) . whether lyman alpha clouds in voids are associated with galaxy halos or are a distinct population remains controversial ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; morris et al .",
    "1993 ; see stocke 2001 for further references ) .",
    "either we are missing a population of galaxies that reside in the voids or the cdm models produce too much clustering of matter on small scales ( bode , ostriker & turok 2001 ) .",
    "the sizes of voids have also been used to place constraints on cdm models .",
    "blumenthal et al . (",
    "1992 ) and piran et al .",
    "( 1993 ) find that the frequency and size of voids detected in redshift surveys are difficult to reconcile with cdm models unless the universe is open or that galaxies do not trace mass on very large scales .",
    "there are several different algorithms in the literature for detecting voids ( see , for example , kauffmann & fairall 1991 ; kauffmann & melott 1992 ; ryden 1995 ; ryden & melott 1996 ; el - ad & piran 1997 ( ep97 ) ; aikio & mhnen 1998 ) but due to the large diameter of voids ( their characteristic diameter is as large as 50 @xmath0mpc ) and the limited volume of most surveys , relatively few voids have been objectively detected .",
    "a search for voids has so far been made using the first slice of the center for astrophysics survey ( slezak , de lapparent & bijaoui 1993 ) , the southern sky redshift survey ( pellegrini , da costa & de carvalho 1989 ; el - ad , piran & da costa 1996 , epc96 ) , the iras 1.2 jy survey ( el - ad , piran and da costa 1997 , epc97 ) , the las campanas survey ( mller et al .",
    "2000 ) and the pscz survey ( plionis & basilakos 2001 ) . voids were detected in the cfa slice and the las campanas survey , restricted to two - dimensions due to the small declination range of each data set .",
    "eleven voids with @xmath895% significance have been detected in the ssrs2 survey ( epc96 ) , twelve voids with @xmath895% significance have been detected in the iras 1.2-jy survey ( epc97 ) and fourteen voids with volumes larger than @xmath9 mpc@xmath10 have been detected in the pscz survey ( plionis & basilakos 2001 ) .",
    "statistically , voids have also been studied using the void probability function ( vpf , white 1979 ) and the underdensity probability ( @xmath11 , vogeley et al .",
    "1989 ) , which depend on the hierarchy of n - point correlation functions .",
    "the vpf is simply the probability that a randomly selected volume contains no galaxies .",
    "the @xmath11 measures the frequency of regions with density contrast @xmath12 below a threshold .",
    "these statistics reveal statistical information about the void population but do not give details on specific voids .    a first step in rectifying our relative neglect of voids is to quantitatively",
    "characterize their properties , as defined by surveys at different wavelength . here",
    "we adapt the approach of ep97 in order to search for voids in the pscz survey ( saunders et al .",
    "2000 ) and the updated zwicky catalog ( uzc , falco et al .",
    "we describe the surveys in section [ sec : survey ] and describe the algorithm in section [ sec : algo ] .",
    "we present our results and draw conclusions in section [ sec : res ] and [ sec : conc ] respectively .",
    "we consider two surveys with different wavelength selection to see if the same voids are detected and if the properties of voids in overlap regions are similar ( see section [ sec : sizevoid ] ) .",
    "we consider different samples from the two surveys to check the robustness of results .",
    "in particular we are able to check the effect of the wall / field criteria on the detection of voids ( see section [ sec : resfield ] ) and by how much the volume of voids is restricted by the sample depth ( see section [ sec : resedge ] ) .",
    "the updated zwicky catalog ( falco et al . 1999 ) includes a re - analysis of data taken from the zwicky catalog and center for astrophysics redshift survey to @xmath13 15.5 ( zwicky et .",
    "al 1961 - 1968 ; geller & huchra 1989 ; huchra et al .",
    "1990 ; huchra , geller & corwin 1995 ; huchra , vogeley & geller 1998 ) together with new spectroscopic redshifts for some galaxies and coordinates from the digitized poss - ii plates .",
    "improvements over the previous catalogs include estimates of the accuracy of the cfa redshifts and uniformly accurate coordinates at the @xmath14 level .",
    "the uzc contains a total of 19,369 galaxies . of the objects with m@xmath15 ,",
    "96% have measured redshifts , giving a total number of 18,633 objects .",
    "the catalog covers two main survey regions ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 both with @xmath18 .",
    "we consider three different samples from the catalog .",
    "we construct a volume - limited sample with @xmath19=0.025 corresponding to a depth of 74@xmath0mpc , for an einstein - de sitter cosmology .",
    "the absolute magnitude of each galaxy is estimated to be @xmath20 - 3z\\ ] ] and this sample is limited to @xmath21 .",
    "previous analyses of the cfa or uzc samples have removed areas in the south galactic cap region with extinction larger than @xmath22 .",
    "we do not apply this cut as it severely restricts the volume of the survey .",
    "instead , we compare the voids we find in the uzc with those we find in pscz to examine if the paucity of galaxies in these regions of the catalog causes us to falsely detect voids .",
    "this volume - limited sample contains 3518 galaxies , which is the largest number of galaxies in a volume limited sample that can be constructed from the catalog .",
    "application of the wall / field criteria ( defined in section [ sec : wallfield ] ) to this sample yields 3240 wall galaxies and 278 field galaxies .",
    "we also consider the same volume limited sample without applying the wall / field criteria to see how the voids are affected when we insist they are completely empty .",
    "we also consider a sample that extends an extra 20@xmath0mpc in depth to estimate the impact of the survey boundary on the estimated sizes of voids .",
    "objects in the pscz survey were selected from the iras point source catalog ( beichman et al .",
    "1984 ) which is a catalog of detections down to a flux limit of 0.6 jy taken with the iras ( infra - red astronomical satellite ) .",
    "targets for the pscz survey were chosen to maximise the sky coverage but at the same time other considerations such as completeness , flux uniformity , having a well defined sample area and redshift range were taken into account .",
    "( see saunders et al .",
    "2000 and references therein for a more complete description of target selection criteria . )",
    "the pscz survey covers 84% of the sky .",
    "areas with incomplete iras data and high optical extinction , such as the plane of the galaxy , are not included in the survey .",
    "the pscz survey contains 15,411 galaxies . of order 8,000 objects",
    "had known redshifts in the literature ( saunders et al .",
    "follow - up observations were carried out to obtain the remaining redshifts .",
    "the median redshift of the survey is 0.028 corresponding to a comoving depth of @xmath23mpc assuming an eds cosmology .    in a flux limited sample",
    "the number density of detectable objects decreases with distance .",
    "thus , we are more likely to detect voids towards the edge of the survey because the average galaxy - galaxy separation increases . therefore we restrict the depth of the sample to the median redshift , 0.028 , which closely matches the depth of the uzc sample .",
    "as ir selected surveys are sparse compared to optically selected surveys , we keep all the galaxies in the sample , _ i.e. _ we do not construct a true volume - limited catalog .",
    "we find that void properties do not vary with depth over the range we consider , thus the void finding algorithm is robust with respect to small changes in the selection function .",
    "the average density of objects in this pscz sample is comparable to the density of objects in the volume - limited uzc sample if we do not apply the volume limited criteria to pscz .",
    "this allows us to compare voids found in the two surveys at similar sampling density .",
    "as for the uzc , we consider this sample in two ways , one where we we apply the wall / field galaxy criteria ( defined in section [ sec : wallfield ] ) and one where we do not ( and so all galaxies are wall galaxies ) .",
    "this sample contains 8425 galaxies ( 7743 wall galaxies and 682 field galaxies ) a third sample is constructed in which we extend the sample by 20@xmath0mpc .",
    "again , this is to examine by how much we underestimate the volume of voids when we impose our cut in depth .",
    "here we outline the steps involved in our void finding algorithm .",
    "each of the steps are discussed in detail in the subsequent sections .",
    "the void finding algorithm we adopt is very similar to the method used by el - ad & piran ( void finder ep97 , epc97 ) .",
    "tests with toy model distributions and results of n - body simulations indicate that this algorithm is robust in locating voids and measuring their sizes .",
    "the method allows for `` field galaxies '' in the voids , which are removed before void detection .",
    "this step ensures that void detection is not dominated by shot noise of the few galaxies in these large underdensities . setting a minimum void size",
    "prevent voids from percolating through small gaps in the dense wall - like or filamentary structures .",
    "this minimum void size is also set so that the voids are statistically significant in comparison with randomly occurring holes in a poisson distribution with the same average density of objects .",
    "as long as the sampling density is high enough that the overdense structure are well - defined ( no gaps comparable to or larger than the minimum void threshold ) , then void detection is not highly sensitive to the sampling density .    the steps of the void finding algorithm are as follows :    * classification of galaxies as wall or field galaxies , section [ sec : wallfield ] * detecting empty cells in the distribution of wall galaxies , section [ sec : cells ] * growth of the maximal empty spheres , section [ sec : spheres ] * classification of the unique voids , section [ sec : classvoids ] * enhancement of the void volume , section [ sec : volume ]      the first stage in identifying voids is to determine which galaxies are classed as field galaxies and which are wall galaxies .",
    "here we follow the method of ep97 .",
    "first we calculate the mean distance , _ d _ , to the @xmath24 galaxy and the standard deviation on this value , @xmath25 .",
    "we then specify a length _ l@xmath26 _ such that any galaxy that does not have @xmath27 neighbours within a sphere of radius _",
    "l@xmath26 _ is classified as a field galaxy .",
    "the value of _",
    "l@xmath26 _ we adopt is given by _",
    "l@xmath26 _ = _",
    "d _ + 1.5@xmath25 and we set @xmath27=3 . for our main samples , the values of _ d _ and _ l@xmath28 _ that we obtain for the pscz survey are 3.42@xmath0mpc and 7.19@xmath0mpc respectively while for the uzc we obtain 3.46@xmath0 and 6.52@xmath0mpc .",
    "this choice of sphere size means that field galaxies are found in regions with density contrast , @xmath29 , of less than -0.5 . for _",
    "n_=3 @xmath3010% of galaxies are classified as field galaxies in both surveys . if @xmath27=0 then all the galaxies are field galaxies and the survey is just one large void ( or two because of the disjoint geometry of both the pscz and uzc ) . if @xmath27 is higher than 3 , then the proportion of galaxies classified as field galaxies drops rapidly",
    "we compare results for our main sample to an analysis of a sample where all the galaxies are classed as wall galaxies to see what effect the exclusion of field galaxies has on the voids we detect .",
    "we also have to consider what effect the edges of the survey have on our wall / field criteria .",
    "galaxies close to the edges may appear isolated and be classified as field galaxies but they may be part of large groups just outside the geometry of the sample under consideration .",
    "this could lead to a slight overestimation of the size of the voids near the survey boundary because a maximal sphere in the vicinity of an erroneously classified edge galaxy can be grown to the survey boundary rather than being bounded by that galaxy .",
    "as these wrongly classified field galaxies are only those close to the survey edge , the maximal spheres can not be grown much larger and hence the void sizes should not be overestimated by a large amount .",
    "there is no indication that voids near the boundaries are larger than those interior to the surveys .",
    "similarly , we may overestimate the values of @xmath29 for voids that lie close to the edges as the wrongly classified field galaxies may lie within a void .",
    "however , on inspection , few of these galaxies actually lie in voids due to the spherical nature of voids and the proximity of the survey boundary .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have developed and tested a void finding algorithm , similar to that of ep97 , and applied it to the pscz and uzc surveys .",
    "our method differs slightly from that of ep97 in the criteria that we use to identify unique voids ; there is no obvious definition of how to group holes into voids .",
    "we demonstrate that our technique gives robust results in the sense that different samples from the same survey yield the same voids and we detect similar voids from redshift surveys with different wavelength selection . as an extension to the work of ep97 and epc97",
    "we quantify the effect of our void definition on the number of voids detected within a survey and we provide estimates of how accurately we are able to recover the volume of voids .",
    "we determine that the diameters of the voids presented here are probably accurate to within 20% . detecting voids with relative densities of @xmath31",
    ", we find that up to 40% of the volume in the surveys under consideration is found in void regions .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of epc97 and shows that voids are indeed a large part of the universe .",
    "the next generation of surveys , the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( colless et al . 2001 and references therein ) and , in particular , the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al . 2000 and references therein ) will aid our understanding of voids .",
    "both of these surveys cover a larger sky area than the uzc , although not quite as large an area as the ir surveys .",
    "the sdss will cover a quarter of the sky in one contiguous area which will be especially useful for void detection .",
    "both the 2dfgrs and the sdss will reach fainter magnitude limits than previous surveys , approximately 4 magnitudes deeper than the uzc .",
    "this will allow us to construct volume limited samples with more galaxies , which extend to greater depths .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the multiband digital photometry , as well as the deep spectroscopy , of the sdss will also allow us to study the properties of the field galaxies in detail .",
    "we will have a large enough sample of galaxies found in low density environments to statistically check if they have different properties than the galaxies found in the wall regions , allowing the role of environment on galaxy properties and formation to be examined ."
