    "the problem of conservation of angular momentum in systems containing magnetic moments has been around since the discovery of einstein - de haas @xcite and barnett @xcite effects one hundred years ago .",
    "the first effect demonstrated that the change in the magnetic moment of a feely suspended body generates mechanical rotation , while the second demonstrated that mechanical rotation induces magnetization .",
    "for some time the einstein - de haas and barnett effects were used to measure the gyromagnetic ratio of solids @xcite .",
    "the significance of such measurements was diminished by the discovery of the electron spin resonance and the ferromagnetic resonance that provided a more accurate determination of the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "after that the experiments on macroscopic magneto - mechanical gyroscopic effects have been largely abandoned . surprisingly , however , microscopic mechanisms of the transfer of the spin angular momentum to the phonon system and subsequently to the body as a whole remain poorly understood .",
    "the tradition that goes back to the pioneering work on spin - phonon relaxation by van vleck @xcite consists of ignoring conservation of angular momentum under the excuse that the hamiltonian of the system does not possess full rotational invariance .",
    "it is clear , however , that in theory ( and in experiment ) the angular momentum in a system of interacting spins and phonons is conserved .",
    "this prompted a significant effort by a number of researchers to formulate the theory of magneto - elastic interactions in a rotationally invariant manner @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such approach is that it is parameter free in a sense that spin - phonon rates can be expressed in terms of the well - known independently measured parameters .",
    "emergence of micro- and nanoelectromechanical devices ( mems and nems ) rejuvinated interest to the problem of angular momentum in magneto - mechanical systems @xcite .",
    "einstein - de haas effect at the nanoscale has been experimentally studied in magnetic microcantilevers @xcite and theoretically explained by the motion of domain walls @xcite .",
    "switching of magnetic moments by mechanical torques in nanocantilevers has been proposed @xcite .",
    "mechanical resonators containing single magnetic molecules have been studied by quantum methods @xcite .",
    "experiments have progressed to the measurement of the angular momentum exchange between of a single molecular spin and a carbon nanotube @xcite .    in nanoresonators",
    "the problem is somewhat simpler due to the finite number of resonant modes . for a single spin in a macroscopic body , however , the number of phonon degrees of freedom is practically infinite . in relation to the angular momentum",
    "this problem has received significant recent attention in experiments with atomic spin - based qubits @xcite and in application to spintronics @xcite . to address this problem",
    "zhang and niu recently introduced a concept of the phonon spin @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate this concept for the process of the relaxation of a single atomic spin in a macroscopic body . by developing an approach similar to that for photons",
    "we find that within the elastic theory the angular momentum of phonons can be naturally split into the orbital angular momentum @xmath0 and the spin angular momentum @xmath1 .",
    "the orbital part corresponds to the rotation of the elastic medium around a certain point , while the spin part corresponds to a small - radius circular shear displacements of points of the elastic media around their equilibrium positions , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     and the phonon spin angular momentum @xmath1 . ]",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the concept of the angular momentum in classical and quantum theories of elasticity is discussed in section [ am ] .",
    "conservation of the total angular momentum is studied in section [ conservation ] by computing its commutator with the hamiltonian .",
    "quantum dynamics of the angular momentum of the relaxing spin and emitted phonons is investigated in section [ qt ] .",
    "section [ conclusion ] contains summary of the results and some final comments .",
    "the angular momentum of the elastic solid is defined as @xmath2 where time - indendent @xmath3 corresponds to the non - deformed body , @xmath4 is deformation , and @xmath5 is the momentum density .",
    "it consists of two parts @xmath6 where @xmath7 the orbital part described by @xmath0 corresponds to the rotation of the elastic medium around the origin , while the spin part described by @xmath1 corresponds to a small - radius circular shear displacements of points of the elastic media around their equilibrium positions , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "applying time derivative to these expressions one obtains @xmath8 the dynamical equation for the displacement field is the newton s equation @xmath9 with the force in the right - hand - side being a gradient of the stress tensor @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath12 . after integrating by parts in equations ( [ lz - derivative ] ) and assuming zero elastic stress at the boundary of the body",
    ", one obtains @xmath13 in the linear elastic theory @xmath14 is zero in the absence of internal torques due to the symmetry of the stress tensor .",
    "such torques are ignored by the conventional elastic theory .",
    "@xmath1 , that is quadratic on deformations , is also neglected in the linear elastic theory , making @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath16 is non - symmetric , more care is needed .",
    "this can happen for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is the intrinsic anharmonicity of the elastic theory due to the nonlinearity of the strain tensor @xcite , @xmath17 the fact that @xmath11 must depend on @xmath18 leads to @xmath19 which is non - symmetric .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case the second term in eq .",
    "( [ dotl - sigma ] ) is needed for the condition @xmath15 to be exact .",
    "anharmonicity , however , is not the only reason for @xmath16 to be non - symmetric .",
    "it also happens in the presence of spins because spin dynamics generates internal torques .",
    "consider , e.g. , a uniaxial spin hamiltonian of the form @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the magnetic anisotropy axis .",
    "elastic deformations of the body rotate the anisotropy axis @xmath22 by a small angle @xmath23 @xmath24 to the first order in @xmath23 one has @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "expanding @xmath26 up to the linear terms in @xmath27 , we get @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and the spin - lattice coupling is given by @xcite @xmath30 the corresponding stress tensor @xmath31 is non - symmetric . writing it as @xmath32 one obtains @xmath33 which explicitly expresses the internal mechanical torque via the elastic twist .",
    "the latter comes from the spin - lattice coupling . in what follows",
    "we will show that @xmath1 associated with the phonon spin is also generated in the problem of quantum relaxation of the atomic spin .",
    "consequently , @xmath1 , that is usually neglected in the linear elastic theory , turns out to be important for the conservation of the total angular momentum , even in cases when the problem is solved with linear non - interacting phonons .      to obtain the second - quantized expression for the angular momentum",
