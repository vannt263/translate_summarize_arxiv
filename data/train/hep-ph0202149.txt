    "the announcement of high statistics atmospheric neutrino data by the superkamiokande collaboration @xcite has confirmed the deficit of muon neutrinos , especially at small zenith angles , opening a new era in neutrino physics .",
    "although there may be alternative solutions of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly  @xcite it is fair to say that the simplest interpretation of the data is in terms of @xmath10 to @xmath11 flavor oscillations with maximal mixing .",

    "many attempts have appeared in the literature to explain the data .",
    "here we review recent results  @xcite obtained in a model  @xcite which is a simple extension of the mssm with bilinear r - parity violation ( brpv ) . this model , despite being a minimal extension of the mssm , can explain the solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
