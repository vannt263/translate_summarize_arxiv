    "the understanding of the lowest lying scalar mesons remains as one of the most challenging problems in low energy qcd . over the past years experimental evidence",
    "has accumulated for the existence of a light scalar nonet @xcite but there is still an intense debate about the structure of these mesons .",
    "there are essentially two proposals for the structure of light scalar mesons : a @xmath5 structure and a @xmath6 one . in the latter case",
    "the are at least three possible dynamical configurations : a meson - meson molecule , a diquark - diquark state and a compact genuine @xmath7 state .",
    "in addition there exist the possibility that isosinglet scalars contain a certain amount of glueball .",
    "most of recent work has been dedicated to the understanding the properties of light scalars in the light of these pictures , explored in different formalisms .",
    "since photons couple to charge , electromagnetic decays of mesons have been intensively used in the past to obtain information on their structure . as for scalar mesons , there exist calculations for the @xmath8 @xmath9 decays using a variety of approaches est1,est2,barnes:1985cy , est3 , in particular , in different versions of the quark model @xcite , with very different results depending on the details of the model .",
    "the generally accepted conclusion , is that the measured @xmath10 decay widths pdg04 are not consistent with a @xmath5 structure . in the light of these results , other possibilities for the structure of light scalars such as a molecule picture @xcite and a @xmath6 structure est3 were explored .",
    "more recently , some tools to determine the glueball content of mesons from their branching fractions in radiative quarkonium decays and production cross sections in @xmath11 collisions , were developed in @xcite .",
    "also , the two photon decay of the lightest scalar , the @xmath12 or @xmath13 , has been studied using different formalisms black , eef02,rekalo yielding very disparate predictions .",
    "the possibility that this meson has a large glueball content was analyzed in pennington using the two photon decay channel . as shown in this work , the extraction of the two photon coupling of light isoscalars from data on @xmath14 is not straightforward and requires a careful analysis in order to get reliable results .",
    "the two photon decay of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons were also studied in @xcite in the framework of a chiral theory involving scalars and a linear realization of chiral symmetry , a linear sigma model ( l@xmath17 m ) , where the key interaction is the one violating @xmath18 symmetry ntt .",
    "this interaction is assumed to be the manifestation at the hadron level of the effective six - quark interaction ( for @xmath19 ) induced by instantons@xcite . in this concern",
    "this interaction identifies the fields entering the model as @xmath5 states . in this formalism , the two photon decay of neutral scalars is induced at the one loop level . the scalar decay firstly into two ( real or virtual ) charged mesons which annihilate into two photons . as to the information on the internal structure of scalars which can be inferred in this calculation",
    ", we must stress that a naive estimation of the distances explored by the photons in this decay are of the order of  @xmath20 @xmath21 which is of the same order as the kaon charge radius , thus the effective degrees of freedom seen by the photons are actually mesons rather than quarks . in this sense",
    ", we can infer that the decaying mesons are @xmath5 states but this bare state has large quantum fluctuations into meson - meson states whose exact amount is difficult to quantify .",
    "recently we pointed out the existence of a quasi - degenerate chiral nonet in the energy region around @xmath22 and studied the possibility that mesons below 1.5 gev arise as admixtures of normal @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , with the latter lying at its natural scale as dictated by the linear rising of meson masses with the number of constituent quarks @xcite .",
    "this model has the nice feature of reducing to the one explored in @xcite in the case when we decouple the @xmath6 states .    in this work",
    "we explore the predictions of the model presented in nr , nr1 for the two photon decay widths of all neutral scalars below @xmath23 .",
    "the most general form for the @xmath25 transition amplitude is dictated by lorentz covariance and gauge invariance as@xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the kaon weak decay constant and @xmath28 denotes the electromagnetic fine constant .",
    "the factors @xmath29 @xmath27 in eq.(ampl ) are introduced just for convenience in future manipulations . with this normalization",
    "the form factor @xmath30 is dimensionless .    in the effective theory formulated in @xcite",
    "the two photon decays of neutral scalar mesons below 1.5 gev are induced by loops of charged mesons as depicted in fig .",
    "1 . a straightforward calculation yields@xmath31",

    "for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 decays the model in @xcite yields contributions coming from are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and their respective heavy partners  @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the loops . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we denote these mesons as @xmath51 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the couplings entering in the loops were calculated in @xcite and are listed in table i , we refer the reader to @xcite for details of the notation .",
    "table i    @xmath58    it is worth noticing that the coupling of light scalars to light pseudoscalars quoted above reduce to the ones obtained in the linear sigma model @xcite  when we decouple the heavy fields .",
    "the two photon decays are of course dominated by light meson in the loops , heavy meson contributions being suppressed by the corresponding inverse mass powers .",
    "the values extracted in @xcite for the mixing angles entering these expressions are @xmath59we use also the relations@xmath60using these values and the masses quoted in @xcite we obtain the results listed in table ii for the form factors .",
    "we include the contributions of different mesons step by step in order to have an idea on the effects of different mesons in the loops .",
    "table ii    @xmath61    as expected , the main contribution comes from kaon loops due to its relatively light mass .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the world average in the case of the two photon decay of the @xmath62 the modifications introduced by the mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath63 fields to the picture in the conventional ( updated ) linear sigma model @xcite are also exhibited in table iii .",
    "table iii    @xmath64    the form factor for to the @xmath46 decay as predicted by the chiral model for @xmath0 and @xmath65 states corresponds to a width @xmath66",
    "next , we work out the predictions of the model for @xmath12 ( or @xmath17)@xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath47 and @xmath47 decay into two photons . in this case",
    "we expect the main contribution to come from @xmath69 @xmath51 and @xmath70 meson loops . in table",
    "iv we list the couplings involved in these processes as arising from the chiral model for @xmath0 and @xmath63 states    table iv    @xmath71    again , couplings for light scalars to light pseudoscalars listed in table iv reduce to the linear sigma model ones when we decouple heavy fields . in this sense , we would like to notice that the naive mixing factor used in @xcite for @xmath72 contains an incorrect minus sign .",
    "where @xmath73 denotes the scalar mixing angle in the strange - non - strange basis .",
    "a complete calculation yields actually @xmath74 which coincides with the present calculation when we decouple heavy scalars .",
    "the angle @xmath73 coincides with the angle @xmath75 in the present work . ]",
    "eventhough contributions coming from charged @xmath55 loops are suppressed , they are crucial in the understanding of two photon decay of the @xmath76 . indeed",
    ", the sign assumed in @xcite takes the result arising from kaon and pion loops in the right direction to match experiment .",
    "we recalculated this decay in the l@xmath17 m correcting for this sign finding a @xmath55 contribution in the opposite direction .",
    "the different contributions to this form factor as obtained in the l@xmath17 m are quoted in the table vi .",
    "predictions of the chiral model for @xmath0 and @xmath65 states for the different contributions to the form factor describing @xmath77 decay are also shown in the table v.    table v    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the form factors in table v yield the following decay widths @xmath78",
    "in this paper we work out the predictions of the chiral model for @xmath79 and @xmath65 states @xcite for the two photon decay of all neutral scalars below 1.5 gev . except for the @xmath80 and the @xmath16",
    ", there is no experimental information on these decays .",
    "the predictions of the model for the @xmath81 decay are in very good agreement with experiment . as for the @xmath82 we recalculate and update the linear sigma model predictions for this decay finding a discrepancy with the experimental results .",
    "the situation is improved by the mixing inherent to the chiral model for @xmath0 and @xmath65 states @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , on the one side the extraction of the width from experimental data is not an easy task as shown in @xcite , thus the world average quoted in @xcite should be taken with some care ; on the other side we expect the @xmath16 to arise actually as a mixing of @xmath0 , @xmath65 and glueball .",
    "the latter has not been included in the model under consideration and according to recent analysis based on chiral symmetry the @xmath16 can acquire some component along the glueball direction @xcite , thus we expect modifications to the present picture upon the inclusion of glueball degrees of freedom .",
    "finally the model gives definite predictions for the two photon decays of the @xmath83 @xmath47 and @xmath84 .",
    "it is particularly interesting the small decay width of the latter two mesons into two photons , even if they are composed of quarks in this model .",
    "the small width of these mesons has been usually argued as the signal for a large glueball component .",
