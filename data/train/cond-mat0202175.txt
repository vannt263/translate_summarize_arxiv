    "for many years the renormalization group ( rg ) has been used to study interacting fermi systems in one spatial dimension ( @xmath11).@xcite the success of rg methods in @xmath11 relies on the fact that at low energies , the two - body interactions between fermions can be parameterized in terms of four coupling constants , which are usually called @xmath12 ( backward scattering ) , @xmath13 ( forward scattering of fermions propagating in opposite directions ) , @xmath14 ( umklapp scattering ) , and @xmath15 ( forward scattering of fermions propagating in the same direction ) .",
    "most authors have focused on the calculation of the rg @xmath16-functions , which in the wilsonian rg@xcite describe the flow of these couplings as the degrees of freedom are eliminated and rescaled.@xcite however , the rg @xmath16-functions do not completely describe the physical behavior of the system .",
    "in particular , the rg @xmath16-functions do not contain information about the single - particle excitations . to investigate these",
    ", one should calculate the momentum- and frequency - dependent single - particle spectral function @xmath17 , which at temperature @xmath18 is related to the imaginary part of the single - particle green function @xmath19 via @xmath20 in the absence of backward and umklapp scattering , the leading asymptotic long - distance and long - time behavior of the single - particle green function @xmath21 in the space - time domain can be calculated via bosonization if the energy dispersion is linearized around the fermi points ( tomonaga - luttinger model , tlm).@xcite obviously , in order to obtain the spectral function , one should calculate the fourier - transform @xmath22 of @xmath23 , which in general can not be done exactly . for the spinless tlm with @xmath13-interactions a mathematically non - rigorous but physically reasonable asymptotic analysis yields at temperature @xmath24 for wave - vectors close to @xmath25 and for low energies,@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is some ultraviolet cutoff with units of energy ( for example a band width cutoff ) . at weak coupling the anomalous dimension @xmath28 and the velocity @xmath29 of collective charge excitations are to leading order @xmath30 here",

    "the dynamic scaling function ( [ eq : tildeascale ] ) is scale invariant , so that for an arbitrary scale factor @xmath45 @xmath46 this scale invariance is a consequence of the fact that the tlm represents a critical system , corresponding to the luttinger liquid fixed point.@xcite hence , the rg @xmath16-function of the tlm vanishes identically .",
    "it is generally accepted that the tlm describes the generic low - energy and long - wavelength properties of one - dimensional fermi systems with dominant forward scattering .",
    "thus , the tlm is an effective model which in the regime where backward and umklapp scattering are irrelevant emerges at low energies when the high - energy degrees of freedom are integrated out in a wilsonian rg .    in the theory of dynamic critical phenomena@xcite",
    "it is usually assumed that correlation functions close to the critical point can be written in the dynamic scaling form ( [ eq : specbosscale ] ) , with some dynamic scaling function @xmath47 .",
    "the dynamic scaling function depends on @xmath33 only implicitly via @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "for example , at finite temperatures , where we may identify @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the scaling function @xmath52 of the tlm has been discussed by orgad , kivelson , and collaborators.@xcite    suppose now that we iterate the rg to some large scale factor @xmath53 , and write the resulting spectral function in the scaling form analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : specbosscale ] ) , @xmath54 according to the above argument , we would expect that for @xmath55 the scaling function @xmath56 becomes independent of @xmath57 and approaches @xmath58 for large @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in this work",
    "we shall show that this expectation is not quite correct : even if both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are large compared with unity , the difference @xmath63 can be small . in this regime",
    "we find that @xmath64 behaves quite differently from the scaling function of the tlm .",
    "physically , this is due to the fact that the spectral line - shape of a generic one - dimensional fermi system with dominant forward scattering exhibits in general some non - universal features which are determined by irrelevant couplings and thus spoil the universality of the spectral function .",
    "in fact , even the spectral function of the tlm exhibits some non - universal features.@xcite we shall here attempt to calculate the spectral function of the @xmath13-tlm using rg methods .",
    "therefore we shall calculate the rg flow of the irreducible _ two - point _ vertex .",
    "recall that the usual rg @xmath16-function describes the flow of the momentum- and frequency - independent part of the _ four - point _ vertex .",
    "surprisingly , the problem of calculating the spectral function of a strongly correlated fermionic system like the tlm via rg methods has not received much attention .",
    "in fact , with the exception of the recent work by ferraz,@xcite where the spectral function of a special @xmath65 fermi system has been calculated by means of the field theory rg , we are not aware of any rg calculation of the spectral line shape of a strongly correlated fermionic many - body system .",
    "note that in order to obtain a non - trivial @xmath66- and @xmath67-dependence and the anomalous scaling properties given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : specbosscale ] ) , one should retain infinitely many couplings which are irrelevant by naive power counting .",
    "in other words , one needs to keep track of the rg flow of coupling functions . at the first sight",
    ", this seems to be a formidable task , which is impossible to carry out in practice .",
    "nevertheless , in this work we shall show that at weak coupling a simple truncation of the hierarchy of functional rg equations for the irreducible vertex functions yields an expression for the spectral function which has the correct anomalous scaling properties and , at least for @xmath68 , agrees with the exact result known from bosonization .",
    "originally , exact rg flow equations have been developed in field theory and statistical physics to study systems in the vicinity of a critical point.@xcite recently , several authors have started to apply these methods to interacting fermi systems at finite densities.@xcite in the normal state the existence of a fermi surface adds some new complexity to the problem : because the single particle green function exhibits singularities on the entire fermi surface , the fermi surface plays the role of a continuum ( in @xmath69 ) of rg fixed points .",
    "however , this fixed point manifold is not known a priori , and should be calculated self - consistently within the rg . in ref .",
    "we have shown how the true fermi surface of the interacting system can be calculated from the requirement that the rg approaches a fixed point . fortunately , in @xmath11 we know a priori that the fermi surface ( which consists of two points @xmath25 ) is not renormalized by the interactions,@xcite so that the above mentioned problem of a self - consistent determination of the fermi surface does not arise .",
    "even if the shape of the fermi surface is known , the implementation of the exact rg for fermi systems is non - trivial and some open problems remain . in particular , in ref .",
    "we have pointed out that the rg approach proposed in refs",
    ".   includes only the mode - elimination step , but completely omits the usual rescaling .",
    "we have further speculated that this incomplete rg transformation might be responsible for the runaway flow to strong coupling which is typically encountered in these works .",
    "the purpose of this article is to further substantiate this claim by applying the functional rg method to a non - trivial yet exactly solvable many - body problem where the results can be critically compared with known results obtained by other methods .",
    "starting point of our calculation are the exact flow equations derived in ref .  , which give the rg flow of the one - particle irreducible vertices when degrees of freedom are integrated out and a subsequent rescaling step is applied . for convenience",
    "we shall now briefly present these equations for the special case of @xmath11 , using a slightly different notation than in ref .  .",
    "we shall work at zero temperature , but expect that our results also describe temperatures @xmath70 as long as we consider energy scales large compared with @xmath71 . in @xmath11 , the fermi surface consists of two points , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 labels the right and left fermi point .",
    "an arbitrary wave - vector @xmath66 can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "note that the deviation @xmath79 from @xmath25 is always measured locally outwards , which is different from the convention usually adopted in bosonization.@xcite for small @xmath80 we may expand the non - interacting energy dispersion @xmath81 around the fermi points , @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the bare mass of the fermions . as discussed in ref .  , the expansion ( [ eq : epsexpansion ] ) is around the true fermi momentum of the interacting many - body system .",
    "of course , in @xmath11 the interacting and non - interacting @xmath3 are identical if we compare systems with the same density .",
    "note that by time reversal invariance @xmath84 , so that @xmath31 and @xmath83 are independent of @xmath85 .",

    "the result for the spectral function @xmath362 is quite encouraging : it has the correct scaling properties , and for @xmath68 agrees with the exact bosonization result . for finite @xmath363 and @xmath67 ,",
    "we have found evidence that the spectral line shape in the vicinity of the luttinger liquid fixed point exhibits some non - universal features .",

    "the usual interpretation of this runaway flow is that it signals some instability of the normal metallic state.@xcite in ref .",
    "we have pointed out that this runaway flow might also be an artifact of the one - loop approximation , and that the properly renormalized vertices could remain finite at the two - loop order .",
    "the crucial point is that the renormalized vertices involve wave - function renormalization factors ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammarescale ] ) ) , which for a strongly correlated system can cancel a possibly strong enhancement of the unrescaled vertices . our simple @xmath11 model allows us to study such a scenario in detail . in this case",
    "@xmath368 can be parameterized in terms of a single marginal coupling @xmath369 , which is defined in analogy to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g2def ] ) and ( [ eq : gtdef ] ) , @xmath370 at the two - loop order , the flow equation of @xmath369 for our model is,@xcite @xmath371 this implies @xmath372 obviously , @xmath369 diverges at a finite scale @xmath373 .",

    "the latter is defined as a model describing the _ fixed point _ of the rg .",
    "thus , the @xmath13-coupling that appears in the tlm should be identified with the _ renormalized coupling at the rg fixed point _ , which is related to the fixed point value of our rescaled coupling @xmath177 , @xmath374   \\ ; ,   \\label{eq : grenflow}\\ ] ] see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gammarescale ] ) and ( [ eq : gtdef ] ) . similar relations between vertex functions and interaction parameters at the rg fixed point are well known from landau fermi liquid theory.@xcite in our simple model with a linearized energy dispersion the two - loop flow equation of the rescaled coupling is simply @xmath375 , so that the limit @xmath248 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : grenflow ] ) indeed exists .",
    "note that the vanishing wave - function renormalization factor @xmath4 exactly compensates the diverging unrescaled coupling @xmath369 such that the rescaled coupling @xmath177 remains finite and small .",
    "we believe that the above interpretation of the runaway flow of the rg - flow equations for the marginal part of the unrescaled vertices @xmath376 is not only specific to @xmath11 , where the rg fixed point does not correspond to a fermi liquid . assuming that in @xmath65 the rg fixed point corresponds to a strongly correlated fermi liquid with @xmath377",
    ", we expect that the unrescaled vertices given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fourpointmarg ] ) will flow to a finite but large value , which numerically might be indistinguishable from a runaway flow to infinity .",
    "at the same time , the properly rescaled vertices @xmath378 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammarescale ] ) can remain finite and small .",
    "the problem of calculating correlation functions of many - body systems at finite wave - vectors or frequencies using rg methods has not received much attention . for classical systems ,",
    "functional rg calculations of the momentum - dependence of correlation functions can be found in the textbook by ivanchenko and lisyansky.@xcite here we have presented a functional rg calculation of a momentum- and frequency - dependent correlation function of a non - trivial quantum - mechanical many - body system . for a special @xmath65 system a similar calculation has recently been performed by ferraz,@xcite who used the field theory rg .",
    "we believe that the method described in this work will also be useful to study other problems where no exact solutions are available .",
    "for example , the spectral function of one - dimensional fermi systems where backscattering or umklapp scattering are relevant can not be calculated exactly by means of bosonization or other methods .",
    "using our rg method , it should be possible to obtain the spectral function of luther - emery liquids even away from the luther - emery point .",
