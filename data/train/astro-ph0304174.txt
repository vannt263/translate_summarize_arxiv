    "subdwarfs are metal - deficient stars , classically defined as lying below the stellar main - sequence in optical color - magnitude diagrams @xcite .",

    "cool subdwarfs ( spectral types sdk and sdm ) are typically found to have halo kinematics ( @xmath12 km s@xmath6 ; gizis 1997 ) , and these objects are presumably relics of the early galaxy , with ages of 1015 gyr .",
    "because low mass subdwarfs have lifetimes far in excess of the age of the galaxy , they are important tracers of galactic chemical history , and are representatives of the first generations of star formation .    all of the coolest subdwarfs ( [ fe / h ] @xmath130.3 ) and extreme subdwarfs ( [ fe / h ] @xmath140.5 ; gizis 1997 ) currently known have been identified in optical proper motion surveys , most notably luyten s half - second catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lhs ) and two - tenths catalog @xcite , the apm proper motion survey @xcite , and the galactic plane survey of @xcite .",
    "the substantial space velocities of halo subdwarfs allow them to stand out in these surveys amongst the overwhelming multitude of similarly faint , but slowly moving , background stars .",
    "however , only a handful of very cool subdwarfs with spectral types sdm6/esdm6 and later have been found @xcite .",

    "the coolest subdwarfs known have masses just above the hydrogen burning minimum mass ( hbmm ) , which ranges from 0.072 m@xmath9 for solar composition ( @xmath16 ) to 0.092 m@xmath9 for @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "final flux calibration of the individual spectral orders was done using 2mass photometry ; however , because the orders do not span the entire photometric bandpasses @xcite , our final flux calibration may be somewhat underestimated at j - band , but reasonably correct for the h- and k - bands .    the resulting nir spectrum is shown in figure 2a .",
    "the 1.52.4 @xmath27 spectral energy distribution is fairly smooth and blue , reminiscent of an early - type main - sequence star or white dwarf , and quite unlike the much redder nir spectra of late - type m and l dwarfs ( cf .",

    "2003 ) . however , the red optical / nir colors and optical molecular bands ( see below ) of 2mass 0532 + 8246 are inconsistent with a hot stellar atmosphere .",
    "we instead attribute the shape of the nir spectrum to enhanced absorption by the cia h@xmath0 1 - 0 quadrupole band centered near 2.5 @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this pressure - sensitive band , present in late - type l and t dwarfs @xcite and cool subdwarfs @xcite , is generally broad and featureless , consistent with the observed spectrum .",
    "strong h@xmath0 absorption may explain the absence of ch@xmath30 absorption bands at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath27 , the defining features of t dwarfs ; and the 2.3 @xmath27 co band , a key spectral feature in m , l , and early - type t dwarf spectra .",
    "on the other hand , h@xmath0o absorption appears to be present at 1.31.5 and 1.72.0 @xmath27 , and minor features throughout the h - band are likely attributable to weaker h@xmath0o lines .",

    "overall , this portion of the spectrum of 2mass 0532 + 8246 is quite unlike any known late - type m , l , or t dwarf , based on its blue slope and absence of ch@xmath30 and co bands .",
    "the j - band spectrum , shown in detail in figure 2b , is far more rich , with atomic lines of k i ( 1.1690 , 1.1773 , 1.2543 , 1.2522 @xmath27 ) and fe i",

    "we obtained a red optical spectrum of 2mass 0532 + 8246 on 3 january 2003 ( ut ) using lris on the keck - i 10 m telescope .",
    "conditions were clear with sub - arcsecond seeing . two exposures of 1200 sec each were obtained through the red channel , dithered by 2@xmath29 between exposures along the 1@xmath29 ( 4.7 pixels ) slit .",

    "henear arc lamp exposures were taken immediately after the target observations for wavelength calibration , and quartz lamp flat - field exposures ( reflected off of the interior dome ) were observed at the start of the night to correct for detector response .",

    "the final flux - calibrated and telluric - corrected optical spectrum for 2mass 0532 + 8246 is included in figure 2a and shown in detail in figure 2c .",
    "strong metal hydride bands of feh ( 8692 , 9896  ) , crh ( 8611 , 9969  ) , and cah ( 6750  ) are clearly discernable .",
    "the 9896  feh wing - ford band is the strongest seen in any cool spectrum to date , and absorption from the shorter wavelength feh and crh bands extends to roughly 9100  .",
    "weaker bands of tio ( 7053 , 8432  ) and h@xmath0o ( 9250 , 9400  ) are also seen .",
    "we point out an absorption feature between 95709700  which is too strong to be attributable to intrinsic h@xmath0o absorption , based on the weakness of the 9250  band ; it is also not properly placed for feh , crh , tih , or ch@xmath30 absorption .",
    "this band is weakly present in late - type m and early - type l dwarf spectra , and may be a hitherto unrecognized metal hydride band .",
    "it is also possible , although unlikely , that this feature is attributable to residual telluric absorption , as telluric corrections were made only to 9650  ( the extent of the strong terrestrial h@xmath0o bands ; stevenson 1994 ) .",
    "individual alkali lines of na i ( 8183 , 8195  ) , rb i ( 7800 , 7948  ) , and cs",
    "i ( 8521 , 8943  ) are present , while the resonance k i doublet ( 7665 , 7699  ) is exceptionally strong and pressure - broadened , as seen in late - type l and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the red optical / nir colors of 2mass 0532 + 8246 are clearly a consequence of the k i red wing ; integrating the spectrum over the @xmath33 bandpass @xcite yields @xmath33 @xmath28 19.2 and @xmath34 @xmath28 4.0 , similar to mid- and late - type l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the blue end of the spectrum appears to be similarly suppressed by the pressure - broadened na i doublet ( 5890 , 5896  ) .",
    "both li i ( 6708  ) absorption and h@xmath35 ( 6563  ) emission lines are absent .",
    "the overall spectral morphology , excluding hydride bands and tio , is again quite similar to the l7 denis 0205@xmath21159ab , suggesting a rather cool atmosphere .",
    "2mass 0532 + 8246 is not a t dwarf , based on the absence of the 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath27 ch@xmath30 bands @xcite , and the presence of strong feh and crh and weak tio and na i features in the optical @xcite .",
    "it appears that this object is instead a metal - deficient , late - type l dwarf .",
    "enhanced cia h@xmath0 and strong hydride bands in the optical and nir spectra of 2mass 0532 + 8246 are consistent with a metal - poor atmosphere .",
    "both are consequences of the overall reduced metal opacity , resulting in larger column abundances of the remaining chemical species and increased relative abundance of metal hydrides over double - metal species .",
    "the presence of the 7053 and 8432  tio bands is somewhat at odds with this interpretation , particularly since tio is generally weak or absent in disk dwarfs later than l5 @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that the mechanism of ti depletion in these objects  incorporation into multiple - metal condensates of catio@xmath36 , ca@xmath36ti@xmath0o@xmath37 , ca@xmath30ti@xmath36o@xmath38 , and ti@xmath0o@xmath36 @xcite  may be inhibited in the low - metallicity atmosphere of 2mass 0532 + 8246 .",
    "chemical equilibrium calculations incorporating subsolar abundances are required to address this hypothesis .",
    "the tio bands may also indicate a somewhat warmer atmosphere than the l7 comparison object denis 0205@xmath21159ab .    classifying 2mass 0532",
    "+ 8246 is therefore not straightforward , particularly as there are no other metal - deficient l dwarfs currently known for direct comparison .",
    "the m subdwarf and extreme subdwarf sequences of @xcite terminate at sdm7 and esdm5.5 , respectively , although recent late - type discoveries are classified via extrapolation and limited modifications of this scheme @xcite .",
    "metal classification ( d , sd , esd ) in the gizis scheme is based on the strength of the 7053  tio band , which is exceedingly weak in the spectrum of 2mass 0523 + 8246 .",
    "numerical classification is based on the 6750  cah band , which is suppressed in this spectrum by na i and k i absorption .",
    "thus , a simple extrapolation of the gizis scheme fails in the l dwarf regime . while there is general agreement between the spectral morphologies of 2mass 0532 + 8246 and the denis 0205@xmath21159ab",
    ", the optical / j - band hydride features and tio bands are more similar to mid - type l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "additionally , there are no cool dwarf standards that match the 1.32.4 @xmath27 spectral region .",
    "we therefore tentatively classify this object a late - type sdl .",
    "identification of additional metal - poor l subdwarfs may eventually allow the definition of a robust classification scheme .",
    "examination of the ircam and ccd followup images show that 2mass 0532 + 8246 has moved significantly since it was first imaged by 2mass .",
    "we therefore measured its proper motion by deriving its coordinates on each of the images , using the 2mass coordinates of background stars for astrometric calibration .",
    "results are listed in table 2 .",
    "a linear fit yields @xmath3 = 2@xmath460@xmath50@xmath415 yr@xmath6 at position angle 130.0@xmath51.8@xmath21 , making 2mass 0532 + 8246 one of the highest proper motion stars known @xcite .",
    "this object is not present in the lhs because of its optical faintness , although a faint counterpart may be present in the poss - ii r - band image at the extrapolated position ( figure 1 ) .",
    "residuals in the proper motion fit are indicative of parallactic motion , but positional uncertainties are too large for a reliable measure .    the radial velocity of 2mass 0532 + 8246 was derived by cross - correlating its j - band spectrum with those of five early- and mid - type l dwarfs ( chosen for their strong nir feh absorption ) with measured radial velocities : 2mass 0746 + 2000ab , 2mass 1439 + 1929 , g 196 - 3b , kelu 1 , and denis 1228@xmath21547ab @xcite .",
    "all five of these objects have been observed as part of the nirspec brown dwarf spectroscopic survey @xcite , and are therefore wavelength calibrated in the same manner as the data presented here .",
    "we derive a heliocentric @xmath7 km s@xmath6 , where the uncertainty is derived from the scatter of values amongst the comparison objects .",
    "this value is consistent with heliocentric velocity offsets in the 1.1690/1.1773 @xmath27 k i lines ( @xmath39 km s@xmath6 ) and the optical cs i and rb i lines ( @xmath40 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the substantial radial velocity and proper motion of 2mass 0532 + 8246 identifies it as a high velocity source .",
    "determining its total space motion , however , requires an estimate of its distance .",
    "if we assume 2mass 0532 + 8246 is bound to the galaxy ( galactocentric @xmath41 km s@xmath6 ; carney , latham , & laird 1988 ) , we derive an upper limit distance of 54 pc assuming ( @xmath42)@xmath9 = ( 10.00 , 5.25 , 7.17 ) km s@xmath6 @xcite and local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity @xmath43 km s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a spectrophotometric parallax estimate is highly uncertain , given the substantial redistribution of flux in the nir and uncertainty in the numeric subtype for this object .",
    "however , assuming that the @xmath44 magnitude of 2mass 0532 + 8246 is similar to that of mid- to late - type l dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath45 ) , we derive a conservative estimate of 1030 pc",
    ". the corresponding heliocentric space velocities at the median distance are ( @xmath42 ) = ( @xmath213 , @xmath2301 , 28 ) km s@xmath6 .",
    "the substantial v velocity , between @xmath2390 and @xmath2212 km s@xmath6 over the adopted distance range , indicates zero or retrograde motion with respect to the lsr , and lends additional support that this object is a member of the halo population .",
    "disk l dwarfs with spectral types later than @xmath32l4 are predominately substellar @xcite ; hence , the late - type spectral morphology of 2mass 0532 + 8246 suggests that it too may be a brown dwarf . to test this hypothesis , we compared the estimated t@xmath46 of this object to subsolar metallicity evolutionary models from @xcite . in figure 3 , we plot t@xmath46 versus mass for ages 10 and 15 gyr and metallicities @xmath47 = 0.1 , 0.3 , and 0.01 @xmath11 . at these late ages ,",
    "the transition between stellar and substellar masses spans a substantial range in temperature , and is more dramatic for lower metallicities due to the reduced atmospheric opacities and hence enhanced luminosities @xcite .    deriving an accurate t@xmath46 for 2mass",
    "0532 + 8246 is difficult without adequate distance or bolometric flux measurements .",
    "solar - metallicity mid- to late - type l dwarfs have temperatures @xmath48 k @xcite . in general",
    "there is little difference between the temperatures of m - type subdwarfs and dwarf stars of the same numeric type @xcite , although late - type m subdwarfs ( e.g. , the sdm7 lhs 377 ) may be 100 - 300 k hotter @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt a conservative temperature range of @xmath49 k. we further assume that the metallicity of 2mass 0532 + 8246 lies in the range @xmath50 @xmath11 , typical for sdm and esdm stars @xcite . for these parameters , we derive a mass range of 0.077 @xmath8 m @xmath8 0.085 m@xmath9 .",
    "larger masses correspond to lower metallicities , so that in each case the derived mass is below the hbmm .",
    "therefore , we conclude the 2mass 0532 + 8246 is probably substellar , although more refined estimates of its atmospheric properties through further observations and spectral modelling are required to validate this result .",
    "the existence of a substellar subdwarf is not unexpected , as mass functions for the nearby halo population @xcite and globular clusters @xcite are shallow but rising : dn / dm @xmath51 m@xmath52 at m @xmath32 0.15 m@xmath9 , similar to the disk population @xcite .",
    "however , the steep drop in t@xmath46 , and hence luminosity , across the metal - poor substellar boundary implies that the vast majority of these halo brown dwarfs will have t@xmath53 k ; i.e. , in the t dwarf regime and cooler @xcite .",
    "indeed , one possible t - type subdwarf has already been identified , 2mass 0937 + 2931 @xcite , an object which also exhibits unusually strong cia h@xmath0 and feh absorption @xcite and a substantial proper motion @xcite .",
    "relatively few l - type subdwarfs should exist , however , as they span a much narrower range in mass at ages later than 10 gyr .",
    "the discovery of 2mass 0532 + 8246 may therefore be quite fortuitous .",
    "given its optical faintness , we expect that few counterparts to this late - type l subdwarf will be identified in current proper motion surveys .",
    "nir proper motion surveys , on the other hand , could potentially reveal more of these objects by detecting them at the peak of their spectral energy distribution .",
    "a sizeable fraction of the sky ( @xmath3230% ) has been scanned more than once by 2mass during its three years of observations , and analysis of these data may identify new , very cool high - motion stars . a second generation",

    "<S> in addition , strong hydride bands in the red optical and nir , weak tio absorption , and an optical / j - band spectral morphology similar to the l7 denis 0205@xmath21159ab imply a cool , metal - deficient atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we find that 2mass 0532 + 8246 has both a high proper motion , @xmath3 = 2@xmath460@xmath50@xmath415 yr@xmath6 , and a substantial radial velocity , @xmath7 km s@xmath6 , and its probable proximity to the sun ( d = 1030 pc ) is consistent with halo membership . comparison to subsolar - metallicity evolutionary models strongly suggests that 2mass 0532 + 8246 is substellar , with a mass of 0.077 @xmath8 m @xmath8 0.085 m@xmath9 for ages 1015 gyr and metallicities @xmath10 @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of this object clearly indicates that star formation occurred below the hydrogen burning mass limit at early times , consistent with prior results indicating a flat or slightly rising mass function for the lowest - mass stellar subdwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , 2mass 0532 + 8246 serves as a prototype for a new spectral class of subdwarfs , additional examples of which could be found in nir proper motion surveys . </S>"
