    "the ricci flow has been introduced by r. hamilton @xcite with the goal of providing an analytic approach to thurston s geometrization conjecture for three - manifolds @xcite@xmath0 . inspired by the theory of harmonic maps , he considered the geometric evolution equation obtained when one evolves a riemannian metric @xmath1 , on a three - manifold @xmath2 , in the direction of its ricci tensor@xcite @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath4 in recent years , this geometric flow has gained extreme popularity thanks to the revolutionary breakthroughs of g. perelman @xcite@xmath0 , who , taking the whole subject by storm , has brought to completion hamilton s approach to thurston s conjecture .",
    "the prominent themes recurring in hamilton s and perelman s works converge to a proof that the ricci flow , coupled to topological surgery , provides a natural technique for factorizing and uniformizing a three - dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath5 into locally homogeneous geometries .",
    "this is a result of vast potential use also in theoretical physics , where the ricci flow often appears in disguise as a natural real - space renormalization group flow .",
    "non - linear @xmath6-model theory , describing quantum strings propagating in a background spacetime , affords the standard case study in such a setting @xmath0 .",
    "another paradigmatical , perhaps even more direct , application occurs in relativistic cosmology @xcite@xmath0 , ( for a series of recent results see also @xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "this will be related to the main topic of this talk , and to motivate our interest in it , let us recall that homogeneous and isotropic solutions of einstein s laws of gravity ( the friedman ",
    "lemaitre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) spacetimes ) do not account for inhomogeneities in the universe .",
    "the question whether they do _ on average _ is an issue @xcite that is the subject of considerable debate especially in the recent literature ( see @xcite and follow  up references ; comprehensive lists may be found in @xcite and @xcite ) .    in any case",
    ", a member of the family of flrw cosmologies ( the so  called concordance model that is characterized by a dominating cosmological constant in a spatially flat universe model ) provides a successful _ fitting model _ to a large number of observational data , and the generally held view is that the spatial sections of flrw spacetimes indeed describe the _ physical universe _ on a sufficiently large averaging scale .",
    "this raises an interesting problem in mathematical cosmology : devise a way to explicitly construct a constant  curvature metric out of a _ scale  dependent _ inhomogeneous distribution of matter and spatial curvature .",
    "it is in such a framework that one makes the basic observation that the ricci flow ( [ mflow ] ) and its linearization , provide a natural technique@xcite for deforming , and under suitable conditions smoothing , the geometrical part of scale  dependent cosmological initial data sets .",
    "moreover , by taking advantage of some elementary aspects of perelman s results , this technique also provides a natural and unique way for deforming , along the ricci flow , the matter distribution .",
    "the expectation is that in this way we can define a deformation of cosmological initial data sets into a one - parameter family of initial data whose time evolution , along the evolutive part of einstein s equations , describe the ricci flow deformation of a cosmological spacetime .",
    "to set notation , we emphasize that throughout the paper we shall consider a smooth three - dimensional manifold @xmath2 , which we assume to be closed and without boundary .",
    "we let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be the space of smooth functions and of smooth @xmath9tensor fields on @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath10 the group of smooth diffeomorphisms of @xmath2 , and by @xmath11 the space of all smooth riemannian metrics over @xmath12 .",
    "the tangent space , @xmath13 , to @xmath11 at @xmath14 can be naturally identified with the space of symmetric bilinear forms @xmath15 over @xmath2 .",
    "the hypothesis of smoothness has been made for simplicity .",
    "results similar to those described below , can be obtained for initial data sets with finite holder or sobolev differentiability .",
    "in such a framework , let us recall that a collection of fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , defined over the three - manifold @xmath2 , characterizes  a set @xmath20 , of physical cosmological initial data for einstein equations if and only if the _ matter fields _",
    "@xmath21 verify the weak energy condition @xmath22 , the dominant energy condition @xmath23 , and their coupling with the geometric fields @xmath24 is such as to satisfy the hamiltonian and divergence constraints ; we adopt the summation convention .",

    "the averaging procedure described in @xcite is based on a smooth deformation of the physical initial data @xmath35 into a one - parameter family of initial data sets @xmath38 with @xmath39 being a parameter characterizing the averaging scale .",
    "the general idea is to construct the flow ( [ betadata ] ) in such a way as to represent , as @xmath40 increases , a scale - dependent averaging of @xmath41 , and  under suitable hypotheses  reducing it to a constant - curvature initial data set @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a constant curvature metric on @xmath2 , @xmath44 is the ( spatially constant ) trace of the extrinsic curvature ( related to the hubble parameter ) , and @xmath45 is the averaged matter density . under the heading of such a general strategy",
    "it is easy to figure out the reasons for an important role played by the ricci flow and its linearization . as we shall recall shortly",
    ", they are natural geometrical flows always defining a non - trivial deformation of the metric @xmath1 and of the extrinsic curvature @xmath30 . moreover , when global , they posses remarkable smoothing properties . for instance , if , for @xmath46 , the scalar curvature @xmath47 of @xmath33 is @xmath48 , and if there exist positive constants @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , not depending on @xmath40 , such that @xmath52,and @xmath53,where @xmath54is the trace ",
    "free part of the ricci tensor , then @xcite the solutions @xmath55 of the ( volume  normalized ) ricci flow and its linearization exist for all @xmath56 , and the pair @xmath57 , uniformly converges , when @xmath58 , to @xmath59 where @xmath43 is a metric with constant positive sectional curvature , and @xmath60 is some vector field on @xmath2 , possibly depending on @xmath61",
    ". the flow @xmath62 , describing a motion by diffeomorphisms over a constant curvature manifold , can be thought of as representing the smoothing of the geometrical part of an initial data set @xmath35 .",
    "+ it is useful to keep in mind what we can expect and what we can not expect out of such a ricci  flow deformation of cosmological initial data set .",
    "let us start by remarking that the family of data ( [ betadata ] ) will correspond to the initial data for physical spacetimes iff the constraints ( [ constraint1 ] ) and ( [ constraints ] ) hold throughout the @xmath40dependent deformation .",
    "this is a very strong requirement and , if we have a technically consistent way @xmath63 of deforming the matter distribution and the geometrical data , then the most natural way of implementing the constraints is to use them to define scale ",
    "dependent backreaction fields @xmath64 , @xmath65 describing the non  linear interaction between matter averaging and geometrical averaging , _",

    "the covector field @xmath67 can , in principle , be controlled by the action of a @xmath40dependent diffeomorphism .",
    "however , its analysis requires a subtle interplay with the kinematics of spacetime foliations @xcite@xmath0 , ( _ i.e. _ , how we deal with the lapse function and with the shift vector field in the framework of perelman s approach ) , and will be discussed elsewhere , ( for a pre ",
    "perelman approach to this issue see @xcite)@xmath0 .",
    "+ let us start by observing that the matter averaging flow @xmath68 must comply with the preservation of the physical matter content @xmath69 and must be explicitly coupled to the scale of geometrical averaging . in other words ,",
    "if , for some fixed @xmath70 , we consider that part of the matter distribution @xmath71 which is localized in a given region @xmath72 of size @xmath73 , then we should be able to tell from which localized distribution @xmath74 , at @xmath46 , the selected matter content @xmath75 has evolved .",
    "a natural answer to these requirements is provided by perelman s",
    "backward localization@xcite of probability measures on ricci evolving manifolds .",
    "the idea is to probe the ricci flow with a probability measure whose dynamics can localize the regions of the manifold @xmath76 of geometric interest .",
    "this is achieved by considering , along the solution @xmath77 of ( [ mflow ] ) , a @xmath40dependent mapping @xmath78 , in terms of which one constructs on @xmath79 the measure @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a scale parameter chosen in such a way as to normalize @xmath82 according to the so  called _ perelman s coupling_:@xmath83 .",
    "it is easily verified that this is preserved in form along the ricci flow ( [ mflow ] ) , if the mapping @xmath84 and the scale parameter @xmath85 are evolved backward in time @xmath86 according to the coupled flows defined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the laplacian with respect to the metric @xmath77 , and @xmath89 , @xmath90 are given ( final ) data . in this connection , note that the equation for @xmath84 is a backward heat equation , and as such the forward evolution @xmath91 is an ill - posed problem .",
    "a direct way for circumventing such a difficulty is to interpret ( [ ourp ] ) according to the following two - steps prescription : ( i ) evolve the metric @xmath92 , say up to some @xmath93 , according to the ricci flow , ( if the flow is global we may let @xmath94 ) ; ( ii ) on the ricci evolved riemannian manifold @xmath95 so obtained , select a function @xmath96 and the corresponding scale parameter @xmath97 ,   and evolve them , backward in @xmath40 , according to ( [ ourp ] ) .",
    "with these preliminary remarks along the way , let us characterize the various steps involved in constructing the flow ( [ betadata ] ) .",

    "the operator @xmath112 , when acting on ( bi)scalars , reduces to @xmath113 .",

    "the delicate setting where the parameter dependence is , as in our case , identified with the parabolic time driving the diffusion of the kernel , is discussed in @xcite@xmath0 , ( see appendix a ,  7 for a characterization of the parametrix of the heat kernel in such a case ) , and in @xcite@xmath0",
    ". strictly speaking , in all these works , the analysis is confined to the scalar laplacian , possibly with a potential term , but the theory readily extends to generalized laplacians , always under the assumption that the metric @xmath77 is smooth as @xmath132 .",
