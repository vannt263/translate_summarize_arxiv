    "<S> the single inclusive charged hadron @xmath0 spectra in pb - pb collisions at the lhc , predicted by a combined hydrodynamics+perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach are presented .    </S>",
    "<S> we present predictions for the inclusive transverse momentum distributions of pions , kaons and ( anti)protons produced at mid - rapidity in pb - pb collisions at @xmath1 = 5.5 tev based on hydrodynamics+pqcd calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of the spectra ( @xmath2 5 gev/@xmath3 ) in central pb - pb at the lhc is computed with a hydrodynamical model  successfully tested at rhic  @xcite  using an initial entropy density extrapolated empirically from the hadron multiplicities measured at rhic : @xmath4  @xcite . above @xmath5 3 gev/@xmath3 , additional hadron production from ( mini)jet fragmentation is computed from collinearly factorized pqcd cross sections at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) accuracy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use recent parton distribution functions ( pdf )  @xcite and fragmentation functions ( ff )  @xcite , modified respectively to account for initial - state shadowing  @xcite and final - state parton energy loss  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> +    we use cylindrically symmetric boost - invariant 2 + 1-d relativistic hydrodynamics , fixing the initial conditions for pb - pb at @xmath6 = 0 fm and employing a simple glauber prescription to obtain the corresponding source profiles at all other centralities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the initial source is assumed to be formed at a time @xmath7 0.1 fm/@xmath3 , with an initial entropy density of @xmath8  =  1120  @xmath9 ( i.e. @xmath10 650  gev/@xmath11 ) so as to reproduce the expected final hadron multiplicity @xmath12 1300 at the lhc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the evolution of the system by solving the equations of ideal hydrodynamics including the current conservation for net - baryon number ( the system is almost baryon - free , @xmath13 5 mev ) . for temperatures above ( below ) @xmath14 170 mev the system is described with a qgp ( hadron gas ) equation of state ( eos ) . the qgp eos  obtained from a parametrization to recent lattice qcd results  is maxwell connected to the hadron resonance gas phase assuming a first - order phase transition . as done for rhic energies , we chemically freeze - out the system ( i.e. fix the hadron ratios ) at @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> final state hadron spectra are obtained with the cooper - frye prescription at @xmath16 120 mev followed by decays of unstable resonances using the known branching ratios . </S>",

    "<S> final - state energy loss in the hot and dense medium is accounted for by modifying the akk ffs  @xcite with bdmps quenching weights as described in  @xcite . </S>",
