    "the question how to define a theory of unstable particles which is consistent with general requirements of a relativistic quantum field theory has a long history ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for early work ) . in the beginning ,",
    "the discussion primarily focussed on the definition of the mean mass and the mean lifetime as static characteristics of an unstable particle . in the early 1990s ,",
    "this issue attracted considerable renewed attention in the context of the standard model .",
    "for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite an example was given in the scalar sector showing the field - redefinition dependence of the mass once defined as the zero of the real part of the inverse propagator .",
    "such a definition corresponds to a relativistic breit - wigner mass parameter .",
    "furthermore , for the @xmath1 boson it was shown in refs.@xcite that , at two - loop order , the breit - wigner mass is gauge - parameter dependent .",
    "in contrast , the mass of an unstable particle defined through the real part of the pole of the propagator is field - redefinition and gauge - parameter independent @xcite and therefore qualifies as a physical quantity .",
    "as there is no fundamental dynamical theory of hadron resonances the problem of field - redefinition invariance and gauge - parameter ( in)dependence received little attention for these unstable particles @xcite .",
    "the characteristic properties of hadron resonances eventually have to be described by qcd . with the progress of lattice techniques @xcite and ,",
    "especially , the low - energy effective theories ( eft ) of qcd ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) it is timely to reinvestigate the definition of physical characteristics of resonances . in the present work we study this issue in terms of the charge and the magnetic moment of a spin-1/2 resonance .",
    "the choice of electromagnetic properties is motivated by the fact that there already exists an extensive experimental and theoretical program for investigating resonance photon decay amplitudes and nucleon resonance transition form factors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , experiments aiming at the extraction of magnetic moments of excited baryons have already been performed or are planned ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) .",
    "in order to keep the technicalities as simple as possible , while at the same time studying a sufficiently non - trivial physics case , we consider a toy model for a positively charged , unstable heavy fermion ( @xmath2 ) ( `` resonance '' ) which may decay into a positively charged , stable light fermion @xmath3 ( `` proton '' ) and a stable , neutral pseudoscalar @xmath4 ( `` neutral pion '' ) .",
    "we make use of the following effective lagrangian , @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) denotes the covariant derivative acting on the positively charged fields and @xmath8 is the usual electromagnetic field strength tensor .",
    "for the decay interaction we take a simple pseudoscalar coupling with a real coupling constant @xmath9 . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we also include a coupling of @xmath10 to the resonance with strength @xmath11 , where @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the ellipses stand for an infinite number of interaction terms respecting lorentz invariance and the discrete symmetries @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . throughout this paper",
    "we will make use of dimensional regularization with @xmath16 space - time dimensions .",
    "we do not show any counter terms explicitly but rather subtract the divergences of loop diagrams using the @xmath17 scheme .",
    "the loop integrals appearing in the final expressions of our calculation are therefore to be understood as @xmath17 subtracted .",
    "the following discussion will rely on the fact that physical quantities should remain invariant under a field transformation @xcite .",
    "let us perform in the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lfreia ] ) the field transformation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary real parameter with the dimension of an inverse mass .",
    "this transformation generates @xmath20 where we have only displayed the terms linear in @xmath19 which originate from the expression explicitly shown in eq .",
    "( [ lfreia ] ) .",
    "our aim is to investigate the charge and the magnetic moment of the heavy fermion . as this fermion is an unstable",
    " particle  it can not appear in an asymptotic state .",
    "therefore , let us consider the amplitude of the process @xmath21 for an invariant energy near the mass of the resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ ugprocess : fig ] ) .",
    "the total amplitude @xmath22 will be the sum of a resonant part @xmath23 and a non - resonant part @xmath24 .",
    "the resonant part can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the polarization vector of the photon , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to the intermediate resonance momenta before and after the electromagnetic interaction , respectively .",
    "the dressed propagator of the heavy fermion @xmath29 reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the sum of the one - particle - irreducible diagrams contributing to the two - point function of the heavy fermion .",
    "the dressed propagator @xmath29 has a complex pole which is obtained by solving the equation @xmath32 we define the pole mass as the real part of @xmath33 . in the vicinity of the pole , @xmath29 can be written as @xmath34 where n.p .",
    "generically denotes non - pole , i.e.  regular terms .",
    "the residue @xmath1 is given by @xmath35    for purely technical convenience in the calculations to follow , let us introduce `` dirac spinors '' with complex masses @xmath33 , . ]",
    "@xmath36 for @xmath37 , the spinors satisfy the `` dirac equations '' @xmath38 as well as the identity @xmath39 where a summation over @xmath40 is implied . for @xmath41 , the difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is of @xmath44 so that we can write for the dressed propagator @xmath45 substituting eq .",
