    "the motion of a quantum particle constrained to move on a surface is a phenomenon that can be understood by the arising of forces that exist only as a result of the surface geometry and the quantum mechanical nature of the system .",
    "the first formalism developed in this context is based on the simulation of the classical motion of a particle on a surface in quantum mechanics by forcing the particle to move between two parallel surfaces separated by a distance @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this formalism , known as thin - layer quantization , provides a result that has important physical implications in the description of the quantum mechanics of particles on surfaces .",
    "namely , when the limit @xmath2 is established , one obtains an equation which differs from the usual schrdinger equation by an additional potential which depends on the curvature of the surface .",
    "years later , in 1981 , this idea was generalized by da costa @xcite , who derived the schrdinger equation by starting from the three dimensional one and then reducing it to a two dimensional differential equation . following this procedure ,",
    "he has showed that when a quantum point particle moves confined to a surface embedded in ordinary three  dimensional euclidean space , it is subjected to a geometric potential . from his ideas , a more rigorous approach including the presence of an electric and magnetic field was proposed by ferrari and cuoghi @xcite . they have showed that there are no couplings between the fields and the surface curvature . moreover , by making a proper choice of the gauge , the surface and transverse dynamics are exactly separable .",
    "such model was improved latter by considering the inclusion of the spin of the particle by wang _",
    "_ @xcite . using the same thin - layer quantization scheme to constrain a quantum particle on the surface together with a transformed spinor representation ,",
    "the authors have found the geometric potential and the presence of an extra factor , which can generate additional spin connection geometric potentials by the curvilinear coordinates derivatives . in a more recent work ,",
    "the thin - layer quantization procedure has been refined and the procedure was further developed by taking the proper terms of degree one in @xmath3 ( @xmath4 denotes the curvilinear coordinate variable perpendicular to curved surface ) back into the surface quantum equation @xcite .",
    "the thin - layer quantization formalism has been considered for a variety of problems with different physical contexts as , for instance , in the study of curvature effects in thin magnetic shells @xcite , in the quantum mechanics of a single particle constrained to move along an arbitrary smooth reference curve by a confinement that is allowed to vary along the waveguide @xcite , to derive the exact hamiltonians for rashba and cubic dresselhaus spin - orbit couplings on a curved surface with an arbitrary shape @xcite , in the study of high - order - harmonic generation in dimensionally reduced systems @xcite , to explore the effects arising due to the coupling of the center of mass and relative motion of two charged particles confined on an inhomogeneous helix with a locally modified radius @xcite , to study the dynamics of shape - preserving accelerating electromagnetic wave packets in curved space @xcite , etc .",
    "it is also important to mention that other alternative approaches for the confinement of a quantum particle on a surface are found in the literature .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new formalism has been proposed in order to construct the hamiltonian of a spin-@xmath5 particle with spin - orbit coupling confined to a surface that is embedded in a three - dimensional space spanned by a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate . in this approach",
    ", the authors consider a gauge field that allows us to express the spin - orbit coupling as a non - abelian @xmath6 gauge field .",
    "they also found that the geometric potential represents a coupling between the transverse component of the gauge field and the mean curvature of the surface that replaces the coupling between the transverse momentum and the gauge field .",
    "an extension of this approach was later accomplished in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to study the scattering process in the nonrelativistic quantum dynamics of a spinless charged particle in the presence of the ab potential @xcite in curved space .",
    "this idea is a continuation of the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where the surface studied is described by a topological cone . in this sequel ,",
    "we study the scattering problem on the cone . using a boundary condition based on self - adjoint extension method ,",
    "we obtain the modified phase shift , the @xmath7 matrix and the scattering amplitude in terms of the physics of the problem . in particular , for the scattering amplitude , we verify that it depends on the energy .",
    "we compare this result with the expression for the scattering amplitude obtained in the spin-@xmath5 ab scattering process and verify that the origin of the dependence on energy for the scattering amplitude is due only to the effects of curvature , which arises from the geometric potential .",
    "the plan of this work is the following . in sec .",
    "[ em ] , we abtain the equation that governs the motion of the particle on the cone in the presence of the ab potential . in sec .",
    "[ sa ] , we solve the equation of motion , apply the boundary conditions allowed by the system and address the scattering problem .",
    "expressions for the modified phase shift , @xmath8 matrix , and scattering amplitude are derived .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained for the spin-@xmath5 ab scattering , and verify that the dependence of the scattering amplitude with energy is purely due to the curvature effects . a brief conclusion in outlined in sec .",
    "in this section , we write the equations that govern the motion of a spinless charged particle constrained to move on a curved surface in the presence of the aharonov - bohm potential .",
    "we begin by decomposing the schrdinger equation into its normal ( @xmath9 ) and surface ( @xmath10 ) components @xcite @xmath11 , @xmath12 \\chi _ { n } ,   \\label{aa9}\\ ] ] and @xmath13 \\chi _ { s } ,   \\label{a9}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the charge of the particle , @xmath16 the covariant components of the vector potential , @xmath17 the potential due to the geometry of the surface and @xmath18 is the electric potential on the surface . equation ( [ aa9 ] ) is just an one - dimensional schrdinger equation for a spinless particle constrained on @xmath19 by the normal potential @xmath20 . as we are only interested in the dynamics on the surface , eq .",

    "hence , such irregular solution must be associated with a self - adjoint extension of the operator @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "after we take into account these considerations , we get ( for @xmath85 ) @xmath88 since @xmath34 function is a short range potential , it follows that the behavior of @xmath49 for @xmath89 is given by @xcite @xmath90 ,   \\label{f1asim}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the scattering phase shift .",

    "( [ smatrix ] ) . equation ( [ amplitude ] ) represents the scattering amplitude for the spinless ab problem in the curved space .",
    "note that this result differ from the usual ab scattering amplitude off a thin solenoid because it is energy dependent .",
    "for the special case when @xmath103 , the scattering amplitude now follows from ( [ srhoz ] ) . as a result , we have @xmath115 in the above equation we can see that the scattering amplitude differs from the usual ab scattering amplitude off a thin solenoid because it is energy dependent through the eq .",
    "( [ smatrix ] ) .",
    "let us clarify this question . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , it is known that the dirac - pauli wave equation @xmath116 have only spin dependence through the magnetic interaction @xmath117 .",
    "however , as pointed out by goldhaber @xcite , since a nonrelativistic particle with gyromagnetic ratio @xmath118 obeying the schrdinger equation,@xmath119 it follows that , for fixed @xmath120 , the large components ( and separately the small components ) of a solution of the dirac equation for a nonsingular magnetic field also solve the schrodinger equation for the same field .",
    "the scattering amplitude of a spin-1/2 particle with gyromagnetic ratio 2 interacting with a localized magnetic field is a function only of wave number @xmath121 , and not explicitly dependent on mass .",
    "this is just the result of eq .",
    "( [ amplitudeab ] ) . for this particular case ,",
    "the helicity operator associated with the dirac particle , @xmath122 and its square @xmath123 are conserved in a static nonsingular magnetic field . for a system that does not involve a localized magnetic field configuration , the quantity @xmath124 is known to be the helicity . to this physical system ,",
    "the scattering amplitude for a dirac particle on such a field configuration must be pure helicity nonflip .",
    "this result can also be interpreted through the commutation of the helicity operator with a purely dirac hamiltonian . on the other hand ,",
    "when we consider a singular magnetic field , it fails to do so in the present case because of the @xmath125 term . in particular , by taking into account the field configuration ( [ vectorb ] ) , one obtains the localized magnetic field @xmath126 however , when we include the spin effects , this result leads to nonconservation of helicity in spin-1/2 ab scattering .",
    "thus , we can say that the failure of helicity conservation manifested in the spin-1/2 ab problem stems from the fact that the @xmath34 function singularity make the hamiltonian and the helicity nonself - adjoint operators @xcite .",
    "hence , their commutation must be analyzed carefully by considering first the correspondent self - adjoint extensions and after computing the commutation relation .",
    "now let us return to our problem .",
    "contrary to the ab scattering of a particle with spin , the results above refer to a spinless particle .",
    "however , as mentioned before , the hamiltonian ( [ grello ] ) contains a singularity that arises from the geometric potential in the metric ( [ metric ] ) . in our case , this singularity is associated with a localized curvature , which is referred to a conical like topological defect .",
    "the singular term in eq . ( [ grello ] ) is equivalent to the term in eq .",
    "( [ fieldb ] ) in the ab scattering of a particle with spin , i.e. , it allows the inclusion of irregular solutions in the problem .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the dependence on energy in the scattering amplitude ( [ amplitude ] ) is only due to the effects of localized curvature .",
    "this can be seen by taking @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ vscone ] ) , which implies @xmath127 and , consequently , singularities are absent .",
    "in the present article , we have studied the scattering process of a spinless charged particle constrained to move on a cone in the presence of the ab potential .",
    "the particle is confined on the surface using the thin - layer procedure , which gives rise to the well - known geometric potential .",
    "this potential is responsible for the arising of the @xmath34 function in the equation of motion . using a boundary condition based on self - adjoint extension method , we have obtained the modified phase shift , the @xmath7 matrix  and the scattering amplitude , all of them in terms of the physics of the problem . in particular",
    ", for the scattering amplitude , we verified that it depends on the energy .",
    "we compared the expression for the scattering amplitude obtained in the spin-@xmath5 ab scattering process .",
    "when we are referring to scattering process of particle with spin , this dependence is a consequence of commutation of the helicity operator with the hamiltonian .",
    "hence , we have the helicity nonconservation .",
    "moreover , we have verified that this conclusion can not be applied to the model addressed here because of the absence of the spin element in the system hamiltonian with a singular magnetic field as in eq .",
    "( [ fieldb ] ) .",
    "finally , we have argued that the origin of the dependence on energy for the scattering amplitude is due only to the effects of curvature , i.e. , through the geometric potential .",
