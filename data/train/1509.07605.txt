    "the characterization of the properties of the host galaxies of qso is an important tool to investigate the role of the agn in their evolution . in the last years",
    "there is growing evidence that ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) agn host are very similar in morphology to inactive galaxies at same redshift .",
    "for instance @xcite found that the host galaxies have normal morphologies in @xmath185% of their sample of x - ray bright agn .",
    "the characterization of the properties of agn hosts offers also the opportunity to investigate the link between the central black hole mass and its host galaxy at moderate to high redshift and to trace the possible co - evolution at different cosmic epochs .",
    "the mass of the central black hole ( bh ) can be derived under the assumption that the broad emitting regions are under the sphere of influence of the supermassive bh using the virial method from the analysis of the broad emission lines of the qso and from empirical relation between the continuum luminosity and the size of the broad line region ( blr ) @xcite .",
    "because of the high luminosity of qso and the prominent emission lines these can be done for a large number of sources using various emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand the characterization of the properties of their host galaxies is more challenging because one has to decompose the starlight of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear emission . since the nucleus is more luminous than the host galaxy this observation requires excellent seeing conditions for ground - based observations or images obtained with hubble space telescope . in spite of these difficulties for several qso it was possible to de - blend the nuclear and starlight contribution of quasars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using ground based data or using hst imaging for relatively low ( z @xmath0 1 ) redshift objects ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for a limited number of qsos the use of 8 - 10 m telescope under superb seeing conditions or with adaptive optics imaging has allowed the study of quasar host at high redshift @xcite and/or with adaptive optics @xcite these observations allowed to trace a a first view of the cosmic co - evolution of smbh and their host galaxies ( see e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a less explored issue is to assess the stellar population of the galaxies hosting active smbh as compared with that of inactive galaxies .",
    "the understanding of the link between stellar population and growth and activation of a massive bh can in fact offer important clues to the role of merging for fueling the central bh . although galaxy interactions and merging have been long assumed as a main drive of the agn phenomenon ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) there are agn surveys that seems to indicate that interactions do not lead to enhancement of nuclear activity @xcite .",
    "agn activity in interacting galaxies is no different from that observed for non interacting galaxies .",
    "the study of the colors of the host galaxy is also important to characterize its nature .",
    "it is well known that the color - magnitude relation for normal galaxies exhibits two sequences .",
    "a _ red sequence _ , populated by massive , bulge - dominated galaxies with older , passively evolving stellar populations , and a _ blue cloud _ , populated by blue , star - forming galaxies of small and intermediate masses ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "past studies indicated that the agn host galaxy lie in the so called _ green valley _ that is the transition region between red sequence and blue cloud @xcite this result suggested that the agn feedback can be responsible in regulating the star formation moving galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence .    the best way to investigate the signature of induced starburst in active galaxies is through the optical spectra of the host galaxies .",
    "however this can be pursued only for a limited number of sources because it requires very efficient spectroscopic capabilities and observations under excellent conditions .",
    "this technique therefore has been used with success only for a limited number of objects at relatively low redshift and with a low luminosity nuclei ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , using integral field units ( ifu ) spectrographs , @xcite and @xcite studied samples of luminous unobscured ( type 1 ) quasars providing the morphology , kinematics and the excitation structure of the extended narrow - line region to probe relationships with the black hole characteristics and the host galaxy .    an alternative approach to obtain clues of recent star formation in the host of quasars is to measure the colors of the host galaxies from the de - blending of the nucleus and host components in multi color images of quasars .",
    "although this can not use the more powerful spectroscopic diagnostic to envisage the underlying stellar population this approach can be adopted for a larger sample of targets provided that the multicolor images be available .",
    "this was done in past for 19 quasars at z @xmath0 0.2 by @xcite who find mixed results and for a large number of @xmath13 bl lac host galaxies by @xcite and @xcite who find bluer than normal hosts .",
    "quasar host that are dominated by a disc component appear to have similar color to that of inactive galaxies while quasars that have hosts dominated by spheroidal component appear bluer than inactive galaxies .",
    "more recently @xcite(hereafter m14 ) and @xcite analyzed the stellar properties of galaxies hosting optically luminous , unobscured quasars at z@xmath0 0.6 using stripe82 images .",
    "they focused on the colors of the host galaxy and found that quasar hosts are very blue and almost absent on the red sequence with a marked different distribution from that of normal ( inactive ) galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we aim to investigate the colors of a sample of @xmath1 50 low redshift z @xmath0 0.3 qso using multicolor images obtained by sdss in the stripe82 area .",
    "this is a stripe along the celestial equator in the southern galactic cap .",
    "it is 2.5@xmath14 wide and covers -50@xmath15ra@xmath16 + 60@xmath14 , so its total area is 275 deg@xmath17 .",
    "stripe 82 was imaged by the sdss multiple times since 2000 only under optimal seeing , sky brightness , and photometric conditions .",
    "the total number of images reaches @xmath1100 for the s strip and @xmath1 80 for the n strip .",
    "the final frames were obtained by co - adding selected fields in r - band , with seeing ( as derived from 2d gaussian fit of stars and provided by sdss pipeline ) better than 2 \" , sky brightness @xmath1619.5 @xmath18 and less than 0.2 mag of extinction.the qso sample is extracted from a much larger ( @xmath1 400 objects ) sample of low redshift quasars in stripe82 for which we performed a complete study of the host galaxies in i - band and their large scale environments @xcite . using the deep co -",
    "added sdss images of stripe82 we derive the properties in all five sdss bands of the host galaxies and we compare with a control sample of ( non - agn ) , inactive galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present our qso sample .",
    "section 3 describes the analysis of the data and the main properties of the host galaxies and in section 4 we discuss our results and we compare our findings with those of m14 and other previous studies .",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmology with h@xmath19 = 70 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 = 0.3 and @xmath22 = 0.7 .",
    "in previous papers of this series we investigated the properties of the host galaxies @xcite(hereafter f14 ) and of the galaxy environments @xcite of a large ( @xmath1 400 ) dataset of low redshift ( @xmath2 ) quasars extracted from the the fifth release of the sdss quasar catalog @xcite , based on the sdss - dr7 data release @xcite and observed in the region of sky covered by the stripe82 @xcite .",
    "these studies were based on the images in @xmath23 band and allowed us to go about @xmath12 magnitudes deeper with respect to the usual sloan data and make possible the study of the qso hosts and their environments .    for this multicolor study we considered only objects at z @xmath0 0.3 because beyond this limit the characterization of the qso host galaxies becomes arduous at bluer filters due to the reduced contrast between the host galaxy and the nuclear emission .",
    "we did a number of tests to evaluate the possibility to detect and measure reliably the quasar hosts for a significant fraction of the targets at various redshift and found that the best compromise that maximize the number of objects resolved in all filters ( but not for all objects in @xmath6 band ) is to set a redshift limit to z @xmath1 0.3 .",
    "in fact while in the @xmath23 filter the fraction of resolved objects can be as high as 70 - 80% up to z @xmath1 0.5 ( cfr .",
    "f14 ; m14 ) this fraction falls below 50% for filters",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath1 10% in the @xmath6 band .    from our previous sample of 416 qso ( f14 ) ,",
    "that were extracted from the qso catalogue @xcite , and imaged in the s82 region we extracted those with @xmath13 .",
    "this yields 60 qso , however 4 are unresolved also in our previous ( f14 ) analysis and are not considered .",
    "one object has been removed from the original list due to the presence of a defect in the image .",
    "we visually inspected the spectra of the remaining 55 qso and found that three objects have emission lines typical of liners ( @xmath25 fwhm @xmath0 1000 km / sec and log([oiii]@xmath265007/@xmath27 , as derived from sdss specline table ) and were eliminated from the sample . under these assumptions we are able to construct a sample of 52 qso , representing the 87% of all qso in stripe82 and with z@xmath00.3 , for which we can study the color of the host galaxy .",
    "the mean redshift of this sub sample is @xmath28 = @xmath29 and the average absolute magnitude of quasar host @xmath30 = @xmath31 .",
    "the mean luminosity of our low z qso is @xmath32=-21.8 as derived from the g apparent magnitude and transformed to b band using @xcite transformations .",
    "as expected the sample is dominated by low luminosity qso and merge into the region of objects that can be classified also as seyfert 1 galaxies ( classical division between qso and seyfert 1 @xcite is @xmath32=-22.2 in our cosmology ) .    in our previous work on the environment of",
    "low z qsos @xcite we defined a control sample of galaxies with similar redshift and host galaxy absolute magnitude distributions . to do this",
    ", we selected all the objects classified as galaxies i.e. non - agn ( note that this comparison sample includes both star - forming and passive galaxies ) in the stripe 82 database for which spectroscopic redshifts was determined and was matched in redshift and galaxy luminosity with the sample of qso hosts ( see f14 for details ) . in order to build a control sample that match the characteristics of our multicolor sub - sample of 52 qso we select all the galaxies with @xmath13 and that are well matched in terms of absolute magnitude of quasar host and redshift distribution .",
    "the control sample of galaxies turned out to have 83 objects with a mean redshift @xmath28=@xmath33 and average absolute magnitude of @xmath30 = @xmath34 , indistinguishable from that of the qso hosts , see figure [ fig : miz ] .",
    "plane ( see text ) . ]    for all the objects in this comparison sample of inactive galaxies we obtained from the stripe82 catalogs the magnitudes in all the five sloan bands .",
    "all these magnitudes , as for the qso host galaxies magnitudes were corrected for extinction using the sdss data @xcite and k - corrected using the package kcorrect @xcite .",
    "for the 52 qso we retrieved the calibrated and combined images in all colors ( @xmath35 ) from sdss stripe 82 dataset @xcite .",
    "these final combined frames were obtained by co - adding selected fields that , in r - band , have a seeing ( as derived from 2d gaussian fit of stars and provided by sdss pipeline ) better than 2 arcsecs , sky brightness @xmath36=19.5 mag/@xmath37 and less than 0.2 mag of extinction ; for this reason in all the 5 bands the final frames have the same number of exposures co - added .",
    "the images used have an average seeing , as given by 2d gaussian fit of stars in the frame from sdss , of 1.49@xmath80.10 arcsecs in @xmath6 , 1.41@xmath80.06 arcsecs in @xmath38 , 1.27@xmath80.06 arcsecs in @xmath39 , 1.2@xmath80.07 arcsecs in @xmath23 and 1.25@xmath80.07 in @xmath4 .    in order to derive the properties of the galaxies hosting the qso we performed a 2d fit of the images of the qso following the same procedure adopted for the analysis of the full sample @xcite .",
    "briefly we assume that the image of the qso is the superposition of two components .",
    "the nucleus in the center and the surrounding nebulosity ( the host galaxy ) .",
    "the first is described by the local point spread function of the image while for the second component we assumed a galaxy model described by a sersic law convolved with the proper psf .",
    "the analysis of these images was performed using the astronomical image decomposition analysis package ( aida , * ? ? ?",
    "the most critical aspect of the image decomposition is the determination of a suitable psf . in the case of sdss",
    "images the field of view is large enough that there are always many stars in the co - added sdss image containing the target to properly derive the psf .",
    "as noted in our previous work @xcite the psf provided by sdss pipeline , although it is computed from the stars in the frame that are close to the position of the target , it does not account properly for the shape of the psf at radii larger than about 3 arcsec .",
    "the difference between the psfield psf and the true radial profile of stars was shown in figure 4 of f14 .",
    "the net effect of using psfield psf is that in all cases where the signal from the quasars extends more than 3 arcsec from the center of the image the decompositions in terms of point source plus a host galaxy may be systematically biased . in these cases host galaxies",
    "are overestimated and in a number of cases true unresolved sources are confused with resolved objects .    to derive a suitable psf for the targets in each filter we selected for each field a number of stars around the qso and computed a psf model composed by the combination of 3 gaussians and one exponential functions .",
    "then we looked at the fit ( @xmath40 and visual inspection of the average radial brightness profile ) of the model for each psf stars ( c.f .",
    "details in f14 ) in order to remove possible bad stars ( poor fit ) and fit again all the `` good '' stars to produce the final psf model ( see an example , in all filters , in figure [ fig : sixpsf ] ) .        using these psf models",
    "we then fit all images of the qso and for all objects we computed the fit of the image of the targets in all filters : @xmath41 ( filter `` i '' was already available ) and then evaluated if the object is resolved ( as in the i band ) or not in all the remaining filters .",
    "we note that , as expected , the nucleus / host ratio increases toward u - band , leading to more unresolved cases there than in red filters , in fact only @xmath150% of objects is found resolved in u.    the last step of the analysis is to fit each quasar with a 2 components model ( point source plus a galaxy ) .",
    "again we proceeded with the same recipes as in @xcite .",
    "for the co - added images we assume a readout noise of 9.5 e@xmath42 and an average gain of 3.8 e@xmath42/adu .",
    "the term for the statistical noise is given by the coefficient @xmath43 that multiply the root square of the counts .",
    "for the residual pattern noise we assumed 2% value . the final classification of the targets in each filter was based on the comparison of @xmath40 for the two fit ( only psf and psf + galaxy ) and further visual inspection of the fit . from this procedure",
    "we classified all objects as resolved or unresolved .",
    "two qso are unresolved in all 5 bands and are present in our list for completeness .        to evaluate the errors on the fit parameters we performed a number of simulations of the targets and then compared the results of the analysis of the simulate data .",
    "for each object , we produced ten simulated images assuming the the best - fit parameters of the target but with different random noise and including somewhat different levels of the background ( based on the uncertainty obtained from the original image ) .",
    "these simulated images were then processed using the same procedure adopted for the original one and the estimate of the error is derived from the comparison of the various best fit parameters . from the distribution of the parameter values we assumed the semi - interquartile range as the error for the derived qso parameters ( see table [ tab : sample ] ) .    because our main aim is to study the colors of the host galaxies",
    "when we compare colors we need to derive the k - correction for each filter .",
    "we estimated the photometric k - corrections using the package kcorrect @xcite , v.4.2 , based on the fit of observed photometric points with nonnegative linear combination of galaxy spectral templates .",
    "we used the default set of 5 galaxy templates that are based on stellar population synthesis model of @xcite .",
    "k - corrections were evaluated at z=0 using the @xmath44 magnitudes corrected for extinction . for half of the sources the fit",
    "was performed using all 5 band while for the other half only 4 filters were used .",
    "the quality of the fit is very good ( @xmath451 ; see figure [ fig : kcor ] ) for 90% and 80% of the galaxies , for the subsamples with 5 and 4 bands , respectively .    similarly for the sample of inactive galaxies we obtain good fit for 85% of the galaxies using in all cases 5 bands .",
    "in figure [ fig : kcor ] we show some example of the fit of the sed of qso host galaxy using kcorrect . from this",
    "fits it is also possible to derive some information of the age , stellar content and in particular for the presence of a young component .",
    "we also computed the stellar masses from the sed fitting and since kcorrect assumes a cosmology with h@xmath19 = 100 km s@xmath20mpc@xmath20 , the stellar masses were scaled to our cosmology as log ( m*h@xmath46 ) , where h = @xmath47/100 = 0.7 . also for the comparison sample of inactive galaxies we derived the stellar masses from the sed fitting and in figure [ fig_mass ] we show the distribution of masses for both samples with respect to the redshift .",
    "the two samples show similar properties in particular , for our sample of resolved objects , we find an average mass of the qso host galaxy of @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the comparison sample of normal galaxies .",
    "the sed fitting gives also information on the fraction of the total star formation , relative to average star - formation rate , that has occurred in the previous 300 myr ( b300 ) and 1gyr ( b1000 ) .",
    "for qso hosts and inactive galaxies we obtained both quantities , in figure [ mas_age ] we show the b300 parameter with respect to the stellar mass @xmath50 . as comparison we plot also the distribution of normal galaxies from the sdss spectroscopic sample at @xmath51 derived from the nyu value - added galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "the plot indicate very similar properties , in particular if we consider that qso hosts are mainly found at log(m/@xmath5210 there are no differences among the two samples .    in table",
