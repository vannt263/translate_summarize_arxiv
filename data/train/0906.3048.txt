    "recent advances in spectropolarimetry have ushered in a new era of detecting and characterizing the surface magnetic fields of hot stars ( e.g. , donati et al .  1997 ;",

    "what still lies ahead is extending these results into the winds , where the magnetic fields can have an important dynamical influence .",
    "indeed , magnetic fields of optically thick winds , like those of wolf - rayet stars , can not be seen in the static layers owing to shrouding by the supersonic wind .    in some instances ,",
    "new detections come when pre - existing observations are subject to closer theoretical scrutiny . in others , theory can _ lead _ and _ motivate _ observations , guiding the detections of signals that might otherwise be too weak to distinguish confidently from noise .",
    "it is this latter goal of theoretical support that motivates the approach of this paper , and as a result we adopt a rough and exploratory treatment of the line formation and magnetic environment .    as the detection of weak ( @xmath6 g )",
    "fields is the goal here , it seems likely that such fields will be combed out into a nearly radial configuration for strong - wind stars , perhaps transitioning into a spiral pattern at larger radii where the flow time approaches the rotation period ( friend & macgregor 1984 ; ignace , cassinelli , & bjorkman 1998 ) .",
    "although pockets of locally elevated magnetic fields may lead to a different class of field detections in the wind , here we explore the more generic case of a smooth , global , and largely radial field , using a split monopole field to grossly represent this general configuration .",
    "hence our goal is to determine the characteristic circular polarization signature of a recombination line formed in a strong wind with a split monopole magnetic field , and to use that prediction to assist observers in making detections if such generic fields exist , given that the first detections will likely be a challenge to distinguish from noise .",
    "we leave the issue of highly asymmetric structures to future work .",
    "the reason that direct diagnostics of radial fields would be of value is that they have dynamical importance whenever the local alfven speed approaches the local wind speed .",
    "thus they are important when 1  b v   b r 10 r _ ( v ^-1/2 ) ( m 10 ^ -5 m_^-1 ) ^-1/2  , where @xmath7 is the magnetic field and @xmath8 is the mass - loss rate .",
    "apparently , for the windspeeds of interest in supersonic winds , @xmath9 km s@xmath5 , there is dynamical significance when @xmath10 100  g. open fields with @xmath7 substantially in excess of 100  g would likely leave a conspicuous imprint on the stellar spindown time ( macgregor , friend , & gilliland 1992 ) , but the impact of somewhat weaker fields would be more difficult to interpret , and a more direct diagnostic of their presence is sought .      throughout",
    "we adopt the weak - field approximation ( landi deglinnocenti & landi deglinnocenti 1972 ; jefferies , lites , & skumanich 1989 ) , whereby the longitudinal zeeman shift and the circular polarization act as though they were responding to a magnetic field that was purely the line - of - sight component of the actual field . taking our wavelength scale @xmath11 ( measured from line center ) to be in units of the doppler shift of a fiducial velocity @xmath12 , designed to be flexible to the context of interest ,",
    "then the contribution to the stokes @xmath13 parameter for some infinitesmal region with a given magnetic field @xmath14 and without regard for any velocity gradient ( that is , not invoking the sobolev approximation ) is [ vstatic ] dv(x )  =  di(x+x )  -  di(x - x ) 2  , where @xmath15 is the contribution to the specific intensity in either polarization in the absence of any @xmath7 field . here",
    "[ deltax ] x  =  _ b _ o c",
    "v_1  =   determines the wavelength shift for a line - of - sight magnetic field @xmath16 , so it determines the modification to the @xmath17 in each polarization . also , @xmath18 is the wavelength of the line , and _ b = 1.4 10 ^ -3  g_eff b",
    "( _ o 5500 ) ^2 is the longitudinal zeeman shift .",
    "the constant @xmath19 depends only on line parameters , specifically the effective lande factor @xmath20 and the line wavelength @xmath18 , and is given by = 7.7 10 ^ -4g_eff ( )  .    at this stage @xmath12",
    "is arbitrarily chosen , but our convention for @xmath21 and @xmath11 will be to use for @xmath12 a fiducial windspeed at the zone of peak line formation , a point which we term @xmath22 because we also scale the radius to this point .",
    "this flexible approach allows the actual value of @xmath11 and @xmath21 to be interpreted from the shape of the line profile itself , rather than requiring independently specified physical scales .",
    "note that the above expressions merely serve to describe the action of the weak - field approximation and the role of the zeeman shift ; below we will add the assumption of of a steep velocity gradient and apply the sobolev approximation , modifying eq .",
    "( [ vstatic ] ) to account for the interplay between the velocity @xmath23 gradient and the @xmath7 gradient .",
    "the weak - field approximation applies for fields whose zeeman shift , expressed in units of velocity , is much smaller than the characteristic broadening velocity of the profile . for unresolved surface fields , that is the rotational velocity of the star , but for winds , it is the windspeed @xmath12 characteristic of the line formation .",
    "the latter can be much faster , and indeed our neglect of rotation requires that it is .",
    "such windspeeds are extremely large on the scale of the zeeman effect , since a 100  g magnetic field produces zeeman shifts of only about 1  km  s@xmath5 in optical lines , and this justifies the use of the weak - field approximation . as such ,",
    "our focus is not on strong - field stars like ap / bp stars ( e.g. , babel & montmerle 1997 ; townsend & owocki 2005 ) , wherein the presence of multi - kg magnetic fields leaves a rigid imprint on the circumstellar dynamics .",
    "instead , we are interested in magnetic fields that are closer to equipartition with the wind kinetic energy , where the field dynamical importance is more subtle , but for detectable fields , would still be important to understand .",
    "this approximation allows for an especially powerful conceptual convenience in the context of _ radial _ fields , because then the line - of - sight component of the @xmath7 field depends on angle in the same way as does the line - of - sight component of the windspeed @xmath23 ( also assumed radial ) . as such",
    ", the zeeman shift has an effect that closely mimics the doppler shift , but with different sign in the two polarizations .",
    "then the presence of a radial @xmath7 field serves as a kind of polarization - dependent modification to the effective wind velocity law , for purposes of line diagnostics . subtracting the intensity profiles from these effectively different wind velocity laws",
    "then gives the stokes flux profile @xmath24 .",
    "this project was begun in ignace & gayley ( 2003 ) , where some conclusions were reached about the expected overall scale of the polarization , and the prospects for detection in the winds of @xmath25 100  g fields seemed challenging , but potentially possible with current technology . however , that analysis included only what we term here the `` gradient effect '' , whereby the zeeman shifts imply that the contributing volume at a given wavelength penetrates to slightly lower @xmath26 in one circular polarization than in the other , an effect related to why the @xmath27 profile slopes downward as @xmath28 increases .",
    "however , the current paper will elucidate an additional equally important effect , the `` binning effect '' , which accounts for the fact that a given wavelength bin , integrated over emission in all directions , will receive contribution over a _ smaller solid angle _ for whichever polarization has a zeeman shift that _ augments _ the dopper shift . or looked at in an equivalent way , the zeeman shifts for that polarization would cause emission into the same solid angle to be stretched over a wider wavelength bin , by augmenting the doppler effect .",
    "when the binning effect is appropriately included , we show here that optically thin recombination lines should be expected to have their stokes @xmath24 signal cancel out when integrated over wavelength on either side of the line , red _ or _",
    "this does not imply that the entire @xmath24 profile cancels , however , because the positive and negative components are somewhat separated in frequency , and the good spectral resolution that is standard in modern spectropolarimetry can resolve the positive from the negative contributions if sufficient care is taken .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of multiple inversions in the sign of the polarization suggests that knowing what spectral shape in @xmath24 to expect may be helpful in distinguishing a real signal from noise .",
    "also , for optically _ thick _ lines , we will explore here two new effects that also modify the stokes @xmath24 profile , which both have to do with the fact that magnetized optically thick lines in the sobolev approximation have different escape probabilities , from the local sobolev zone , in different directions for the different polarizations .",
    "the new effect we term the `` angle effect '' stems from the fact that for a given observed wavelength , the two different circular polarizations must escape their sobolev zones along different angles to appear at the same observed wavelength , and that can favor the escape of one polarizaton over the other .",
    "the other new effect we term the `` shape effect '' , whereby the gradient in the zeeman shift alters the doppler gradient that sets the shape of the sobolev zone , augmenting escape in some directions and reducing it in others .",
    "this latter effect assists the escape of photons when the field gradient augments the velocity gradient , and hinders escape when they offset , and that can also favor one polarization over the other .    as we shall see , accounting for these three new effects , one in thin lines and two more in thick , does not generally alter the overall _ scale _ of the circular polarization , but does alter its detailed spectral _ signature_.",
    "it is hoped that knowing in advance what signature to look for will help observers disentangle what is noise from what is signal , at least in the generic context of a split - monopole field treatment .",
    "let us first consider the case of optically thin lines ( so photons created in the line escape the sobolev zone without scattering ) . here",
    "only one additional effect needs to be added to ignace & gayley ( 2003 ) , the `` binning effect '' .",
    "below we show that the binning effect produces an opposite net circular polarization to the gradient effect , and this signal appears closer to line center , so the two together yield a characteristic `` heartbeat '' signature in @xmath29 that exhibits one sign inversion in each profile wing and one more at line center .",
    "as we are ultimately interested only in the ratio @xmath30 and its profile shape , we can scale both the wavelength @xmath11 ( from line center ) and the radius @xmath26 by their characteristic values at the region of peak line formation .",
    "thus @xmath22 is typically the photospheric radius ( either at the stellar surface or at the wind photosphere for thick winds , and we include no emission from @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 is typically the wavelength that resonates at @xmath22 , which might appear as an edge of a `` flat top '' for profiles with a broad peak , or more generally as a kind of half - width at half - maximum for more rounded profiles .",
    "it is not necessary to be more specific , because the scaling of both @xmath11 and @xmath26 are arbitrary to within a constant factor ",
    "it is only the shape and magnitude of @xmath29 that we need to understand , and the shape of the @xmath27 profile itself defines the operational meaning of @xmath11 .",
    "what is actually measured for an unresolved point source is the flux density ( per frequency bin and per detector area ) @xmath33 , but this includes an inverse - square dependence on the distance @xmath34 to the source , which is not a variable of interest here .",
    "we remove that dependence , and also simplify the appearance of factors of @xmath35 later on , by defining i(x )  =  d^2 f(x )  .",
    "then @xmath24 is defined by decomposing @xmath27 into its contributions from opposite circular polarizations , and subtracting the left - hand (  ) from the right - hand ( + ) components .",
    "we also need to specify the tight connection between wavelength @xmath11 and radius @xmath26 , enforced by the sobolev approximation in the presence of steep @xmath23 gradients , which is controlled by the doppler and zeeman shifts along the direction cosine @xmath36 between the observer and the gas parcel in question . that connection for each of the + and  circular polarizations , using eq .",
    "( [ deltax ] ) for weak fields , is [ xofmu ] x  =  -v(r ) ( 1 b ) _  , where @xmath37 is the velocity scaled to the windspeed at @xmath22 ( and corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath32 if magnetic fields are neglected ) , and [ bpm ] b(r )  =  7.7 10 ^ -4 g_eff ( _ o 5500 ) ( b(r ) ) ( v(r ) ) ^-1 comes from eq .",
    "( [ deltax ] ) .",
    "note that when @xmath7 measured in g equals @xmath23 measured in km s@xmath5 , the numerical value of @xmath19 gives @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath19 depends only on the line in question , lines with larger @xmath19 generate larger @xmath40 and are more favorable for detecting circular polarization .",
    "the overall magnitude of @xmath39 is set by @xmath2 , and this determines the detectability of the signal .",
    "the sign conventions used are that @xmath23 is regarded as positive for radially outward flow , and @xmath7 is regarded as positive for radially outward field , so @xmath39 is positive for radially outward @xmath14 also .",
    "this means that a split monopole field , for a given polarization , has @xmath39 augmenting the effective @xmath23 in the hemisphere where @xmath14 is radially outward , and reducing it in the hemisphere where @xmath14 is radially inward .",
    "the ` + ' polarization for @xmath24 is right circular , and this is always listed as the upper sign when two signs are present .",
    "we will always assume @xmath41 and work only to lowest nonvanishing order , consistent with the weak - field approximation .",
    "another important function is the derivative @xmath42 , which controls the width of the solid - angular slice at each emitting point that will contribute in the @xmath43 wavelength bin in each polarization .",
    "thus @xmath44 controls the binning of the emission ( and results in the binning effect ) , and is given by [ dmu ] | ddx _",
    "=   1  b(r ) v(r )  .",
    "it is apparent that when @xmath45 , so for radially outward @xmath14 , right - hand circular polarization experiences zeeman shifts that enhance the doppler effect and spread the emission from a given solid angle over a wider wavelength bin .",
    "this in turn tends to yield a negative @xmath24 , and oppositely for radially inward @xmath14 .",
    "finally , we will assume throughout the paper that there exists a known line emissivity function @xmath46 , the rate of creation of radiant energy in the line per volume per solid angle ( assuming isotropic creation ) at radius @xmath26 , in either of the two independent circular polarizations ( recall that the weak - field approximation to the longitudinal zeeman effect treats all emission as circularly polarized , and the local creation rate in the two polarizations is indistinguishable ) .",
    "further , we assume that known emissivity is of power - law form , [ emit ] ( r )  =  r^-p  . here",
    "@xmath47 may be treated as a variable to treat various types of emission mechanisms , escape probabilities , ionization degrees , and velocity laws .    since @xmath46 is per volume , the radial integrand for the emission scales as @xmath48 , and we assume @xmath49 and carry the integration to @xmath50 .",
    "the neglect of any dependence of photon creation rate on polarization is a reflection of the fact that the zeeman shift relative to the line wavelength , @xmath51 , is smaller than the scale of @xmath39 by the factor @xmath52 .",
    "hence the effects of @xmath39 , which redistribute polarized emission over the line , appear long before the effects of any real difference in the creation rate of photons in the two polarizations .",
    "since the interest here is in radial @xmath7 fields and radial @xmath23 flows , a great simplification is offered by adopting spherical symmetry .",
    "the main stumbling block in using spherical symmetry with magnetic fields is , of course , that a strictly spherically symmetric field must be monopolar , so we may conclude that any physically attainable field must break spherical symmetry .",
    "however , by choosing a _ split _ monopole field for our study , we preserve the maximal symmetry consistent with zero magnetic divergence , since a split monopole field is constructed from a spherically symmetric monopole field by reversing the field throughout one hemisphere .",
    "because of the close connection between split monopole fields and fields that are truly spherically symmetric ( and hence unphysical ) , it is actually convenient to first calculate the stokes @xmath24 , which we denote @xmath54 , that corresponds to a hypothetical spherically symmetric field .",
    "despite being strictly unphysical , this approach will be seen to have pedagogical value , and in the case when @xmath54 corresponds to a monopole field ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) , it can be mapped to the split monopole result after the fact , just by accounting manually for the hemispheric field reversal .",
    "furthermore , in this paper we consider only the most favorable case where the observer sees the star along one magnetic pole , and then mapping @xmath54 into @xmath24 is as trivial as reversing its sign on one whole side of line center .",
    "these considerations allow us to compute @xmath24 from the @xmath54 in complete spherical symmetry , which is a helpful simplification .",
    "specifically , it allows the line profile to be calculated using a single integral over radius , because the emission in each radial bin @xmath56 maps into each @xmath43 bin according only to the solid - angle fraction established by @xmath57 , where @xmath36 is the direction cosine to _ any hypothetical observer _ that would be in position to detect that emission",
    ". normally we would only be interested in a _ particular _",
    "observer , but due to the complete spherical symmetry , we can count all emission as being detected by an array of equivalent observers in all directions , and merely divide by the solid angle of any particular detector to find the actual observed profile flux . indeed , since we are ultimately interested only in the comparison @xmath58 , there is no need for the final step , as we may just as well count all emission as observed emission .",
    "carrying out the radial integral for the wind emission , and for simplicity ignoring occultation and any photospheric continuum effects ( hence we are picturing fairly strong emission lines ) , the results may be written [ iprof ] i(x )  =  _ ( x)^dr  r^2 ( r ) _ +  + _ ( x)^dr  r^2 ( r ) _ - and [ vprof ] v^*(x )  =  _ ( x)^dr  r^2 ( r ) _",
    "+  - _ ( x)^dr  r^2 ( r ) _ -  , where @xmath59 is the formation depth in each polarization for emission in the outward radial direction at @xmath11 .",
    "that is , @xmath59 solves @xmath60 $ ] , and since we envision all emission as coming from @xmath61 , whenever we would otherwise have @xmath62 we replace @xmath63 with unity . also , since we are working only to lowest nonvanishing order in @xmath39 , there is no need to include any magnetic effects in the calculation of @xmath27 , so for that calculation @xmath64 comes from @xmath65 , and we take @xmath66 .    finally , for pole - on observing of a purely radial field that switches from outward in one hemisphere to inward in the other",
    ", we have @xmath67 .",
    "for other observing angles , there will be some intra - hemispheric cancellation that is straightforward to compute by also carrying out the azimuthal integrations that our current symmetry assumptions allow us to suppress .",
    "for this analysis , we are interested in establishing the maximum detectability threshold for a radial field , so we adopt the most optimistic assumption of pole - on observing , and this also simplifies the mapping from @xmath54 to @xmath24 .      to advance our understanding of the desired diagnostic signature",
    ", we again imagine complete spherical symmetry and move in a pedagogically useful but even more physically impossible direction , by considering @xmath68 .",
    "such a situation not only violates the global divergence - free constraint , it even shows _",
    "divergence whenever @xmath23 induces density changes , as for spherically diverging supersonic winds .",
    "but for schematic purposes , this assumption has the useful characteristic that here the zeeman shift will be in _ constant proportion _ to the doppler shift , except with opposite sign in the two polarizations ( see eq .  [ [ bpm ] ] ) .",
    "hence for optically thin lines , the two polarizations will act _ exactly _ like two winds with @xmath37 rescaled by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a global constant .",
    "such a rescaling has the effect of rescaling the @xmath11 axis of the profile by this same global factor , and rescaling the intensity axis by the inverse amount ( as the total emission in the two polarizations is conserved when the lines are thin enough to avoid polarization redistribution during escape ) .",
    "it is this extremely simple behavior that motivates our schematic assumption .",
    "hence in this case , direct examination of the @xmath27 profile for that line would immediately allow us to compute @xmath54 : v^*(x )  =  1 2 \\ { ( 1+b_o)i[(1+b_o)x ]  -   ( 1-b_o)i[(1-b_o)x ] }  .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath70 , this gives [ voiapprox ] v^*(x ) i(x )  =   b_o  , and for pole - on observers , changing sign in the rear hemisphere ( @xmath71 ) gives [ heuristic ] v(x ) i(x )  =   b_o x |x|  .",
    "for a generally bell - shaped @xmath27 profile , this would produce the results as illustrated in figure  1 , for @xmath72 ( other @xmath70 values would generate a proportional scaling ) .",
    "although a physically unimportant case , the pedagogical value of @xmath68 is that it provides an immediate way to see the _ qualitative _ attributes of the @xmath24 profile for radial @xmath7 fields , given only knowledge of @xmath27 and @xmath70 , and it suggests a useful form for expressing the more quantitative results that follow for a more physically plausible field treatment . specifically , we are introduced to the overall `` heartbeat '' shape , while the general form of eq .",
    "( [ heuristic ] ) explicitly demonstrates the `` binning '' ( first term ) and `` gradient '' ( second term ) effects .",
    "the simplest physically possible radial @xmath7 field configuration is the split monopole , for which @xmath73 ( where the `` 1 '' subscript refers to the value at @xmath22 ) , with a positive sign ( outward ) in one hemisphere and a negative sign ( inward ) in the other . to determine @xmath40",
    ", we need to specify @xmath37 , and here we take the homologous approximation @xmath74 , simulating lines that form in the heart of the acceleration region , neither close to nor far from the static star . again the physical scale of @xmath23 and @xmath26 are arbitrary because we are interested only in the shape of the @xmath24 profile relative to the shape of the @xmath27 profile .",
    "when we assume homologous expansion , @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 , and equations  ( [ iprof ] ) and ( [ vprof ] ) produce [ voithin ] v^*(x ) i(x )  =  _ ^dr  r^1-n ( 1 + b_1 r^-3 )  - _ ^dr  r^1-n ( 1 - b_1 r^-3 ) 2 _ ^dr  r^1-n",
    ". then for @xmath77 we have for the minimum radius of formation of the two polarizations for wavelength @xmath11 r_(x )  =  x  b_1 x^2 and @xmath78 , and for @xmath79 we have @xmath80 , as we neglect line emission inside @xmath31 to simulate a photosphere or an ionization change .",

    "a simple recombination line of a majority species with @xmath75 would correspond to @xmath81 .",
    "the results for @xmath27 and @xmath29 for pole - on inclination with @xmath82 = 4 , 5 , and 6 are shown in figure  2 .      a useful way to express equation  ( [ voithin ] )",

    "note that in the heuristic case @xmath86 from equation  ( [ voiapprox ] ) , we have @xmath87 . when @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath79 where the radial integrals are from @xmath22 to @xmath90 , and when @xmath77 , the radial integrals are from @xmath91 to @xmath90 , and @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for split monopole fields , @xmath94 , and",
    "the generalized form recovers the same results as above .",
    "specifically , the new form shows that @xmath24 receives contribution from a term that depends on @xmath27 itself , and a term that depends on the slope of @xmath27 .",
    "the term that is proportional to @xmath27 stems from the `` binning '' effect , whereby for a given @xmath11 , a polarization whose zeeman shifts augment the doppler shift has its intensity weakened by being spread over more frequency bins , and the term that depends on the slope of @xmath27 stems from the `` gradient '' effect , whereby a polarization whose zeeman shift augments the doppler shift originates from deeper depths so receives contribution from a larger volume .",
    "the opposing signs of these two contributions suggest they tend to cancel when _ integrated _ over either side of the emission profile , and we next explore the simple reason why this integrated cancellation is indeed complete for thin lines .",
    "since we consider radial fields and radial flows , and since @xmath95 is considered to be already highly supersonic , the zeeman shift in the weak - field approximation does not pass any emission across line center , so the forward hemisphere maps into the blue side of the line and the reverse hemisphere into the red .",
    "then the fact that for optically thin lines , the total emission in each polarization is the same in any volume implies that @xmath96 when integrated over either side of the line . seeing this feature in @xmath24 profiles ( as it continues to hold _ approximately _ for optically thick lines as well ) would be a good indication of the presence of approximately radial fields , and it underscores the need for good spectral resolution to see not only the usual zeeman - type overall line asymmetry , but also a polarization reversal on _ each side _ of the line independently , which is the general characteristic of the `` heartbeat '' feature .",
    "note that it is not @xmath29 that integrates to zero  the core portion of the percent polarization tends to be diluted by the bright core of @xmath27 , so @xmath29 would tend to show more clearly the polarization in the wings of @xmath27 .",
    "hence the sign of the wing polarization would dominate if it were @xmath29 that was being integrated over @xmath11 , as suggested in figure  2 .",
    "when the sobolev optical depth in the line obeys @xmath97 , photons created in the line must locally scatter until they are able to escape from resonance , in the familiar ways inherent in the sobolev approximation .",
    "this introduces two new avenues for imprinting a net polarization into the profile that we will analyze next , in the context of a complete redistribution approximation .",
    "optically thick line scattering is vastly simplified by assuming that enough scatterings occur such that all `` memory '' of the initial wavelength ( within the line ) , angle , and polarization of the newly created photon is rapidly lost prior to escape from the sobolev zone .",
    "one may then assume that each scattering is like a new creation event for that photon , independent of its history .",
    "this approximation has a generally good reputation in optically thick environments , though its spectacularly streamlining properties are the main reason it is used .",
    "we will make the same approximation here to take advantage of that simplification , and an investigation of the errors introduced is beyond the scope of this initial investigation into the general detectability of weak radial @xmath7 fields .",
    "the fundamental new complication that appears for thick lines is that the shape of the emergent intensity profile depends not only on the radius - dependent photon creation rate , but also on the angle - dependent escape probability from the sobolev zones . in complete frequency redistribution ,",
    "the sobolev escape probability when @xmath97 is inversely proportional to the sobolev optical depth @xmath98 , along the direction @xmath36 from equation  ( [ xofmu ] ) .",
    "all we require is the _ relative _ escape probability @xmath99 because we are treating only the _ effectively thin _",
    "situation where all photons created in the line escape in the line , so the relative escape probability can be normalized to unity when integrated over escaping @xmath36 .",
    "the zeeman shift changes this normalized relative escape probability to lowest order in @xmath40 into _ ( r , )  =  1  +  _ v ^2  b(r ) ( 1  +  _ b ^2 ) 1  +  _ v/3  b(r ) ( 1  +  _ b/3 )  , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 control the line - of - sight doppler and zeeman shifts along @xmath36 . for @xmath75 , @xmath102 , and for split monopole fields , @xmath103 .    as noted above , @xmath104 is normalized so that @xmath105 , as it is a relative photon escape probability normalized over the ( assumed isotropic ) creation and scattering of photons in the line .",
    "it already assumes an angular escape profile inversely proportional to the optical depth profile , so applies only to lines that are optically thick to scattering , and its normalization further requires that the line be effectively thin in the sense that all photons created in the line eventually escape in the line .",
    "effectively _ thick _ lines would not be ideal candidates for observing @xmath29 , because they would likely form too far out in the wind where @xmath2 is low , so would dilute the @xmath24 signal against a bright and largely unpolarized @xmath27 profile .      integrating the wind emission , and ignoring occultation and any photospheric continuum effects for simplicity , optically thick but",
    "effectively thin lines yield the same _ eventual _ escape as optically thin lines ( i.e. , unity ) , so without zeeman influences they yield the same @xmath27 as in equation  ( [ iprof ] ) .",
    "however , to lowest order in @xmath39 we do have changes to @xmath24 given by [ vprofthick ] v^*(x )  =  _ ( x)^dr  r^2 ( r ) _ + _ + ( r , x )  - _ ( x)^dr  r^2 ( r ) _ - _ -(r , x )  , where the product [ thickproduct ] _ _  =  ( 1  +  _ v x^2 v^2 ) ( 1  +  _ v 3 ) v is expanded to first order in @xmath39 , using @xmath103 . again",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath39 in these expressions are evaluated at the @xmath59 that solves equation  ( [ xofmu ] ) for @xmath106 , and since we treat all emission as coming from @xmath61 , whenever we would otherwise have @xmath107 we replace @xmath63 with unity .",
    "if we again take @xmath75 to treat lines that form in the heart of the acceleration region where the expansion is approximately homologous , we have @xmath102 and @xmath76 , then equation  ( [ thickproduct ] ) gives _ _",
    "=  1 r ( 1  3 b_1 x^2 r^5 )  , and equations  ( [ iprof ] ) and ( [ vprof ] ) now become [ voithick ] v^*(x ) i(x )  =  _ ( x)^dr  r^1-p ( 1 + 3 b_1 x^2 r^-5 )  - _ ( x)^dr  r^1-p ( 1 - 3 b_1 x^2 r^-5 ) 2 _ ( x)^dr  r^1-p  .",
    "then for @xmath77 we again have r_(x )  =  x  b_1 x^2 and @xmath108 , and for @xmath79 we have @xmath80 .",

    "we get  =  -p ( p-2 ) ( p+3 ) b_1 x^-3 with i(x )  =  x^-(p-2 ) ( p-2 )  .",
    "note that the results for @xmath27 are identical in the thick and thin cases , because when @xmath75 the escape from the sobolev zone is isotropic either way , and we are treating only the effectively thin situation where all line photons , once created , will escape before being rethermalized .",
    "the results for @xmath27 and @xmath29 for pole - on inclination and @xmath47 = 4 , 5 , and 6 are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the purpose of this investigation is to seek _ general _ aspects of the circular polarization profile due to weak radial fields , and as such the specific shape of the @xmath27 and the @xmath24 profiles are not the primary concern , but rather the connection _ between _ them .",
    "what are the attributes of the @xmath27 , given @xmath83 , that contribute to generating a detectable @xmath29 polarized fraction ? to address this for thick lines ,",
    "we may again place equation  ( [ voithick ] ) in a form similar to equation  ( [ voiapprox ] ) , except that now [ vthickgen ] v^*(x ) i(x )  =  3 x^2 _ x  +   b(x ) d i d x where again @xmath83 is @xmath40 evaluated at @xmath84 , and @xmath109 is the same emission average as in the thin case .",
    "if we then take @xmath75 and @xmath110 , we have for @xmath79 that @xmath111 and @xmath89 , recovering @xmath112 . for @xmath77",
    ", we have @xmath113 and @xmath93 , so @xmath114 as above .",
    "the above results show that for thin lines , the @xmath54 profile integrates to zero over either side of line center , but this constraint is no longer satisfied by thick lines , because zeeman shifts may actually favor the net escape of the polarization that effectively augments the velocity gradient and enhances escape in that polarization",
    ". however , the overall `` heartbeat '' shape appears for both thick and thin lines , so there is still polarization reversal on each side of the line , and the potential exists for cancellation if the wavelength scale of the inversion is not resolved .",
    "the inversion should appear somewhere near where the slope in @xmath27 is maximal , so observational techniques that co - add bins to increase signal must exert caution in that vicinity , lest the bins so generated be too wide and enhance cancellation .",
    "careful inspection of the signal near sign reversals is thus advisable , if global radial fields are present .",
    "one caveat in regard to the problem of unintentional polarization cancellation should be noted .",
    "our schematic approach of choosing a sharp cutoff in the line formation at @xmath22 is related to the profile kink that separates the core and wings of @xmath27 , and this kink is also associated with the discontinuous spike in the wing polarization seen in figs . 2 , and 3 .",
    "this spiky behavior in the wings of @xmath24 is not seen in fig . 1 , because there is no sharp cutoff involved in the line formation that is implicit in that figure .",
    "hence , we may conclude that the sharp and discontinuous wing spike is an artifact of our treatment , and a smoother transition is to be expected , unless the @xmath27 profile itself transitions abruptly from flat - topped to sloping downward .",
    "a smoother transition would also involve some cancellation near the discontinuity in our spiky results , so one should not interpret the peak polarization at the spikes as being real or observationally attainable . nevertheless , the sign transition is the feature of interest , and the capacity to resolve that feature should inform the choices made when co - adding bins .",
    "our results show that discontinuities in @xmath24 can also appear at line center , as in the unphysical situation seen in fig . 1 where the magnitude of @xmath115 is proportional to @xmath37 ( but has a polarity inversion like the split monopole ) , and also for optically thin lines with a split monopole field as in fig",
    ". 2 . in realistic models ,",
    "the line of magnetic polarity inversion would not appear strictly in the hemisphere perpendicular to the line of sight to the star , so the polarization inversion would be more gradual than we depict , but nevertheless could be very noticeable .",
    "a gradual transition with little polarization near line center , on the other hand , happens for optically thick lines with homologous expansion as in fig .",
    "3 , because then zeeman influences near line center ( @xmath116 ) experience a compensation between the `` binning effect '' ( regulated by @xmath57 ) and the `` shape effect '' ( regulated by @xmath117 ) , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ thickproduct ] ) , which causes @xmath54 to tend to zero as @xmath11 does ( like @xmath118 , we find ) .",
    "this in turn causes @xmath24 to pass not only continuously through zero at line center , but also with zero slope , in contrast to the sharp transition in thin lines . note the `` gradient effect '' and the `` angle effect '' are not active near line center , so thin lines experience only the binning effect there , whereas thick lines experience both the binning effect and the shape effect , affecting the rate of escape along @xmath119 into the @xmath43 bin .",
    "the more generic situation is that of figs . 1 and 2 , where a sharp transition is seen the delicate cancellation that produces fig .",
    "3 is a more specialized behavior , although of course some smoothing of the transition will occur due to any non - ideal aspects of the magnetic geometry and inclination . as a result , even when @xmath7 is globally smooth and radial , it is suggested that observers not discount the possibility of polarization detections _ near _ line center , especially when a sign reversal is seen _ across _ line center .",
    "the behavior of the polarization near line center , its magnitude and the sharpness of the sign inversion , may thus be useful in distinguishing thick from thin lines , and homologous expansion from other forms .",
    "for example , the shape of @xmath27 itself would not suffice to distinguish thick and thin lines under homologous expansion , because then @xmath27 has identical shape whenever the lines are effectively thin , regardless of whether or not they are optically thin , because the escape from the sobolev zone is isotropic in either case .",
    "our most robust results , which depend the least on our model assumptions , is the general form of eqs .",
    "( [ vthingen ] ) and ( [ vthickgen ] ) .",
    "these show how the shape of @xmath27 is dependent on the shape of @xmath24 , in the most flexible terms possible , for thin and thick lines respectively , for split monopole fields seen pole - on .",
    "in that situation , these expressions can actually be used to invert the @xmath24 and @xmath27 profiles into an effective @xmath83 distribution , and thereby probe the @xmath37 profile assuming a monopolar @xmath115 .",
    "even more generally , these points suggest that for any type of polarization detection , considerations involving the underlying field topology and global wind model may dictate the effectiveness of various data analysis strategies , and mapping that connection motivates theoretical studies of other types of field geometries in future",
    ". this may be particularly relevant in light of the reported detection by donati et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) of circularly polarized lines in the disk of fu  ori , demonstrating the capability to detect the longitudinal zeeman effect in circumstellar environments at a sub - percent degree of polarization .",
    "all our results , even those for optically thick lines , assume that the lines are _ effectively _ thin , so all photons created in the line escape in the line .",
    "it should be noted that when this is not the case , the @xmath27 will drop relative to what our expressions give , but the @xmath24 will drop _ even more _ , since @xmath24 forms at the greater depths where @xmath2 is largest , but that is also where the lines would be the most effectively thick and rethermalization would be most severe . this would have to be seen against an unfortunately bright background of @xmath27 that forms farther out , where the wind is less dense and rethermalization is less of a problem , and would be largely unpolarized due to the rapidly dropping @xmath2 .",
    "hence it is suggested that effectively thick lines are to be avoided , despite yielding very bright emission lines , because the presence of many photons is not always a benefit when they serve only to dilute the polarized component .",
    "similarly , emission lines that are too weak would be diluted by unpolarized continuum emission , which we did not include in this study to maintain our focus on strong lines with maximum simplicity .",
    "hence it is suggested that lines of intermediate strength , with peak intensities about as bright as the continuum , and significant emission from regions in the wind moving considerably slower than 1000 km s@xmath5 , would be best suited for detecting global radial fields . lines with larger values of the @xmath19 parameter are also favored .",
    "figures 2 and 3 , and eqs .",
    "( [ vthingen ] ) and ( [ vthickgen ] ) , present the fundamental results of this paper , that the circular polarization profile @xmath29 for a split monopole field should exhibit a characteristic `` heartbeat '' shape , explained heuristically in figure  1 .",
    "the scale of the circular polarization is determined by the @xmath39 parameter , so by the ratio @xmath2 characteristic of the peak line formation region , and we find the peak signal in @xmath29 reaches as high as @xmath120 times @xmath121 for thin lines , and around @xmath122 times @xmath121 for thick lines . here",
    "@xmath47 is the power - law index in the volume emissivity , and @xmath123 for the recombination of the dominant species in a region of nearly homologous expansion .",
    "thus @xmath29 might be expected to peak at a level of nearly @xmath124 , although this may be somewhat optimistic because of smoothing mechanisms that would create some cancellation in the sharpest spikes in @xmath24 .",
    "it was stated earlier that @xmath125 at 5500  , when @xmath7 = 100 g and @xmath23 = 100 km s@xmath5 are characteristic of the peak line - forming region designated @xmath126 , manifested in the profile near @xmath127 where the wings of @xmath27 begin to fall steeply .",
    "hence it would not be surprising if a local @xmath7 field of 100 g at a wind photosphere at 100 km s@xmath5 can yield a peak @xmath29 polarization at the 0.1 % level under ideal conditions .",
    "inversely , the greatest challenge to the detection of fields at the 100  g level is if the dominant contribution to the line emission comes at radii where the wind is substantially faster than 100 km s@xmath5 .",
    "all this appears to show promise that fields strong enough to have any dynamical significance in hot - star winds may lie within the reach of modern instrumental detectability , and it is our hope that these results will help assist observers in making detections of such fields if they do in fact exist .",
    "we find it especially significant that the stokes @xmath13 signature , owing to the doppler shifts of rapidly approaching and receding wind hemispheres , reverses sign once on each side of the profile , rather than doing so only at line center where stokes @xmath13 profiles normally reverse in static photospheric applications .",
    "this gives observers a morphological constraint to look for which might otherwise be mistaken for noise were it not expected from the theory .",
    "sharp inversions across line center are also possible and would be as diagnostically useful as inversions in the wings .",
    "the potential presence of multiple sign changes in the polarized spectrum is a potentially important issue to bear in mind when binning data to increase signal .",
    "rotational modulation of the @xmath29 signal would also help separate signal from noise , if the magnetic axis misaligns with the rotation axis , because such a misalignment would create a periodic variation in the inclination of the magnetic pole .",
    "if the fields are not seen pole - on , the conversion from @xmath54 to @xmath24 must include partial cancellation between the side lobes toward and away from the direction of tilt of the magnetic pole , owing to the reversal in the magnetic polarity across the neutral line of radial fields .",
    "hence the results given here are more fundamentally interpreted as a calculation of the spherically symmetric template @xmath54 , with the determination of the observed @xmath24 following from geometric considerations of the ( possibly varying ) inclination of the magnetic neutral line .",
    "here we consider only the ideal configuration to constrain detectability under the most optimistic conditions clearly , the most pessimistic conditions would include a viewing angle along the magnetic equator , resulting in complete cancellation of the circular polarization at all wavelengths , unless the field is highly asymmetric .",
    "we stress that the split monopolar configuration is chosen here simply to exemplify a field with a high degree of symmetry , and because of its `` generic '' character in a dense radial wind environment .",
    "these seem like more natural assumptions for guiding observations , than would making detailed fits to specific conditions intended to match observations that do not currently exist .",
    "althouth theoretical considerations suggest that when rotation is unimportant , approximately radial fields might thread dense winds , there remain ample opportunities for real winds to deviate from quasi - spherical symmetry , especially when rotation _ is _ dynamically important . for example , evidence for such symmetry breaking is present in the rapidly rotating wr star ez cma ( st - louis et al .",
    "1995 ; morel et al .",
    "1998 ) , so it is certainly possible that magnetic detections in hot - star winds may result from aspherical pockets of intense emission from structures in the wind , rather than from the smooth radial fields considered here .",
    "only future observations can resolve this point .",
    "our current analysis has not considered stellar occultation or emission from the stellar photosphere , as we have envisioned fairly strong recombination lines for whom photospheric occultation and emission would not dominate the wind emission .",
    "neither would it be negligible , however , unless the lines are very strong , but as we have seen , such lines would likely form too far out to be ideal for @xmath29 detections in a weak global @xmath7 field .",
    "thus , for important lines of interest , circular polarization from the red wing may well be reduced by occultation , and from the blue wing may be diluted somewhat by the photospheric continuum .",
    "our results are therefore not yet at the level of direct modeling of observed profiles , such detailed modeling is better attempted once promising observational detections already exist .    also , our simple model does not account for clumping , despite significant evidence that clumping is prevalent in hot - star winds ( hillier et al .",
    "2003 ; zsargo et al .",
    "but since our approach is sensitive to the radial distribution of @xmath128 but not its overall magnitude , only radially varying emission enhancements due to clumping would have an impact .",
    "any such radial dependence could be treated as a straightforward modification to the power - law in @xmath128 , which is one of the reasons we parametrized the emissivity in a fairly general way . since clumping that",
    "did not affect the @xmath7 field would tend to affect @xmath27 and @xmath24 similarly , it would likely not have a significant impact on the degree of polarization .",
    "however , depending on the dynamics of the clumping process , it might engender a local increase in @xmath7 , increasing the field detectability in pockets where the emission is especially strong .",
    "these are viewed as quantitative details that must be considered at the level of profile fitting once the basic effects are detected .    besides these issues",
    ", it will also be important to expand our approaches to other geometries .",
    "already , we have made an initial attempt at predicting the @xmath13 profile from a keplerian disk ( ignace & gayley 2008 ) .",
    "further explorations of disks and extensions to rigidly corotating structures ( e.g. , relevant to ap / bp stars like @xmath129 ori e , townsend , owocki , & groote 2005 ) will be pursued in the future .",
