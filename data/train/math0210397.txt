    "one of the main mechanisms of integrability of evolution equations is the presence of two compatible hamiltonian structures . in this paper",
    "we compare hamiltonian properties of three extensively studied nonlinear equations of mathematical physics , related to various hydrodynamical approximations : the korteweg - de vries equation @xmath0 the camassa - holm equation @xmath1 derived as a shallow water equation in @xcite ( see also the paper @xcite ) , and the hunter  saxon equation @xcite @xmath2 describing weakly nonlinear unidirectional waves .",
    "all three equations are known to be bihamiltonian and to possess infinitely many conserved quantities , as well as remarkable soliton or soliton  like solutions .",
    "a motivation for our paper was the paper @xcite , which described scattering theory for all three equations in a unified way .    as we show in this paper ,",
    "the main reason why such a common treatment is possible is that all these equations have the same symmetry group .",
    "it turns out to be the virasoro group , a one - dimensional extension of the group of smooth transformations of the circle .",
    "more precisely , the virasoro group serves as the configuration space , and all three equations can be regarded as equations of the geodesic flow related to different right - invariant metrics on this group ( in the case of kdv and ch ) or on an associated homogeneous space ( in the case of hs ) .",
    "( here we will be mostly concerned with the periodic case , though many statements can be extended to the case of rapidly decaying potentials on the real line . )",
    "the main goal of this paper is to give a description of the three equations as _ bihamiltonian _ systems on the dual to the virasoro algebra , and to relate them to the geometry of the virasoro coadjoint orbits .",
    "one of the corresponding hamiltonian ( or poisson ) structures is provided by the linear lie - poisson bracket , and it is the same for all three equations .",
    "the other poisson structure is constant and can be viewed as a `` linear structure frozen at a point . ''",
    "the corresponding `` freezing points '' are different for each equation .",
    "we will also see that , in a sense , equations ( [ eq : kdv ] ) , ( [ eq : ch ] ) , and ( [ eq : hs ] ) exhaust all generic possibilities , and among them the camassa - holm equation ( [ eq : ch ] ) is the `` most general '' equation that can be obtained by the `` freezing argument '' method on the dual virasoro space .",
    "we tried to make the paper self - contained , including in it necessary background on the euler equations and the classification of virasoro orbits . for additional information",
    "we refer the interested reader to the expositions in @xcite or @xcite , as well as to the original papers listed in the bibliography .    in @xcite v. arnold suggested a general framework for the euler equations on an arbitrary ( possibly infinite - dimensional ) group , which we recall below . in this framework",
    "the euler equation describes a geodesic flow with respect to a suitable one - sided invariant riemannian metric on the given group .    in section 2",
    "we show how arnold s approach to the euler equation works for the virasoro group and provides a natural geometric setting for the korteweg  de vries and camassa  holm equations . in section 3",
    "we give a hamiltonian reformulation of the euler equation . in section 4",
    "we extend this approach to include geodesic flows on homogeneous spaces and then use it to describe the hunter ",
    "saxton equation and its relatives .",
    "this extension might be thought of as a version of the hamiltonian formalism for homogeneous spaces developed in @xcite , @xcite , which is applied to the case of a degenerate metric and in our infinite - dimensional situation .    in sections",
    "56 we develop the bihamiltonian formalism for the euler systems .",
    "we show why the three equations above represent three main classes ( and exhaust the rotation - invariant ) bihamiltonian systems on the virasoro algebra that can be integrated by means of the `` freezing '' ( called also , the translation of ) argument method .",
    "it turns out that the above three equations correspond to three different types of virasoro coadjoint orbits of low codimensions .    in our classification of poisson pairs and the corresponding equations we rely heavily on the classical classification of the virasoro orbits , and we recall it in the appendix .",
    "an interesting open question is to extend the classification of the equations to orbits of higher codimension , as well as to show how the discrete invariant of virasoro orbits manifests itself in the related bihamiltonian systems .",

    "<S> we show that the following three systems related to various hydrodynamical approximations : the korteweg  de vries equation , the camassa  holm equation , and the hunter  </S>",
    "<S> saxton equation , have the same symmetry group and similar bihamiltonian structures . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that their configuration space is the virasoro group and all three dynamical systems can be regarded as equations of the geodesic flow associated to different right - invariant metrics on this group or on appropriate homogeneous spaces . in particular , we describe how arnold s approach to the euler equations as geodesic flows of one - sided invariant metrics extends from lie groups to homogeneous spaces .    we also show that the above three cases describe all generic bihamiltonian systems which are related to the virasoro group and can be integrated by the translation argument principle : they correspond precisely to the three different types of generic virasoro orbits . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss interrelation between the above metrics and kahler structures on virasoro orbits as well as open questions regarding integrable systems corresponding to a finer classification of the orbits . </S>"
