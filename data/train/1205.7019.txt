    "the transport of fermions is central to many areas in physics .",
    "fermion transport can be seen in various systems , including electronic matter , stars during collapses and explosions , and quark - gluon plasma . in particular , the transport of spin is highly relevant to potential technological applications known as spintronics .",
    "the subject of spintronics is to design devices to control spin evolution and dynamics for information storage , transfer , and manipulation @xcite .",
    "thanks to the current state of cold gas experiments , cold gas systems provide a unique opportunity to study these transport properties in a controlled fashion .",
    "the ability of engineering optical lattices in arbitrary geometries in different dimensionalities opens up exciting avenues to visualize and gain deeper understanding of fundamental many body physics .",
    "recent progress in experimental techniques of ultra - cold atoms , such as the technique of detecting a single - site  @xcite , allows one to probe not only the static properties , but also the dynamics of the atoms in optical lattices .    on shorter timescales ,",
    "a systems of ultracold atoms can be used as an effective simulator for thermal equilibrium physics in closed many - body quantum systems .",
    "in contrast , on longer time scales , the presence of underlying inhomogeneous trapping potential provides an ideal platform for studying numerous non - equilibrium phenomena . in cold gas experiments in the presence of population imbalance ,",
    "inhomogeneous trapping potential creates a density imbalance throughout the lattice .",
    "this density imbalance mimics a magnetization and drives the spin current in the cold atom setups . in solid state devices spin current",
    "is produced by injecting spins into the device and can thus be probed by magnetic microscopy or neutron scattering .",
    "after the recent proposal on the ultra - cold atom analog of electronic semiconductor devices known as `` atomtronics ''  @xcite , the study of transport phenomena gained a tremendous momentum  @xcite . in the absence of optical lattice ,",
    "spin transport in strongly interacting fermi gases has been experimentally investigated in two laboratories at mit and rice university  @xcite . in general , the non - equilibrium dynamics of cold atoms in optical lattices are studied after an adiabatic or sudden change of the atom or lattice parameters @xcite . while the dynamics for the adiabatic process are expected to follow the change of the system hamiltonian , the sudden quench leads to the non - equilibrium physics that allows for the understanding of relaxation dynamics in the presence of many - body interactions .",
    "although non - equilibrium dynamics due to the adiabatic or sudden changes have been widely studied , longer time scale dynamics due to the inhomogeneous trapping potential have been largely unexplored .",
    "the spin of the atoms referred to in this paper are one of two hyperfine states available to the atoms .",
    "therefore , we treat the spin as a scalar quantity which points either parallel ( up ) or antiparallel ( down ) to some arbitrary direction of quantization .",
    "the magnetization @xmath0 defined below is proportional to the difference in up and down atom densities . as the overall magnetization in the system",
    "is produced by the fixed population imbalance and the interactions are spin - independent , the total magnetization is a conserved quantity .",
    "the local magnetization can not disappear locally , but can only relax slowly over the entire system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how atoms relax by the magnetization being physically transported within the trap .",
    "indeed , this transport process occurs only in the presence of inhomogeneous potential via a diffusion motion in a larger time scale provided by the underlying harmonic potential .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the spin diffusion of one dimensional lattice fermions in the presence of an external harmonic potential .",
    "we consider longer timescale ( defined later ) dynamics of population imbalanced fermions and study the spin diffusion current and local spin diffusion coefficient , and how these values effect the damping rate of the spin diffusion modes .",
    "we find evidence of spin current in the metallic regions of the lattice , while there being no spin current in insulating regions .",
    "further , in the weak coupling limit , we calculate local spin diffusion coefficient for all regions of the lattice .",
    "the damping rate of spin diffusion modes are estimated using the continuity equation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce our model and formalism . in section iii , we calculate the ratio of spin current to local diffusion coefficient for characteristic values of large and small interaction , and show the interplay between magnetization and susceptibility effects to spin current .",
    "further , the local spin diffusion coefficient is found over the lattice for the weak coupling limit . finally , the damping rate of diffusion modes is estimated within a metallic portion of the cloud .",
    "we display our results with figures in the appropriate dimensionless quantities . in section iv",
    ", we summarize the results and connect them to experiments .",
    "we consider a cloud of atoms consisting of two hyperfine states denoted by spin @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the population imbalance @xmath3 is finite , where @xmath4 is the total number of atoms in two hyperfine states of the same atom .",
    "these atoms are subjected to a combined optical lattice and harmonic trapping potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be represented by the one - dimensional hubbard model .    @xmath5    where @xmath6 creates ( destroys ) a fermi atom with pseudospin @xmath7 at lattice site @xmath8 .",
    "the density operator is @xmath9 and @xmath10 indicates the nearest neighbor pair of sites .",
    "the average chemical potential @xmath11 and the chemical potential difference @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the chemical potential of hyperfine state @xmath14 .",
    "the on - site interaction @xmath15 can be repulsive or attractive",
    ". its magnitude and sign can be controlled by the _ s_-wave scattering length of the two fermi species . in the present work ,",
    "we consider only the positive @xmath15 . in cold - gas experiments , the ratio @xmath16 is controlled by the intensity of the standing laser waves ( the tunneling amplitude @xmath17 is exponentially sensitive to the laser intensity while the on - site interaction @xmath15 is weakly sensitive ) .",
    "experimentally , the 1d geometry can be realized by a strong confinement in the transverse direction with an additional periodic potential applied along the other direction .",
    "we consider a tight one dimensional geometry such that the level spacing in transverse direction is much larger than the energy per particle of the axial direction .    in the presence of the underlying harmonic oscillator potential , the average chemical potential @xmath18 monotonically decreases from the center to the edge of the trap .",
    "the spin diffusion current driven by this spatial variation of the chemical potential is given by the modified fick s law  @xcite ;    @xmath19    where the magnetization density @xmath20 , the spin susceptibility @xmath21 , and the spin diffusion coefficient @xmath22 are values that vary in space , even at equilibrium . here",
    "@xmath23 is the density of hyperfine state @xmath14 at position @xmath24 .",
    "first , we solve the homogeneous hubbard model for the population imbalance system using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) technique and numerically calculate the magnetization and the spin susceptibility as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . by combining the tba solutions with the local density approximation ( lda )",

    "the spin current given in eq .",
    "( [ fl ] ) is driven by the density imbalance and is a longer timescale result .",
    "there are several time scales associated with the experimental setup .",

    "there are two other larger time scales , one associated with trapping frequency @xmath35 and the other associated with the lattice @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the fermi velocity .",

    "@xcite , where @xmath39 , thus , the addition of a lattice with the timescale parameter regime being @xmath40 is feasible in current setups .",
    "using lda , the derivative with respect to spatial coordinate can be converted into a derivative over the average chemical potential @xmath41 . noticing that @xmath42 is independent of the spatial coordinate and using the relations @xmath43 and @xmath44 , spatial dependence of the ratio of spin current and diffusion coefficient",

    "the local diffusion arises from the collisions with opposite spin atoms .",
    "as the time between scattering event @xmath46 is proportional to the local spin diffusion coefficient ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath47 becomes very large when the density @xmath48 and holes @xmath49 are small .",
    "this is the reason why the ratio of spin current to diffusion coefficient @xmath50 is almost zero at the center and at the edges .",
    "the magnetization is almost constant in the mott insulator region , so that @xmath50 is zero in this region . a similar current pattern ( from edge towards the center )",
