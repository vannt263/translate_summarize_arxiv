    "glass transition on surface / interface / thin film has drawn intensive interests in the last two decades for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the importance of surface and thin film in materials science and engineering requires a better understanding of its dynamic and thermodynamic properties .",
    "secondly , the confined geometry is a good approach to understand the mysterious glass transition itself , especially to explore the dynamic properties within the thin film geometry .",
    "numerous works of both experimental and simulation / calculation approaches have been done [ 1 - 23 ] on glass transition on surface / thin film .",
    "keddie and co - workers firstly investigated the supported thin film of ps by ellipsometric measurements @xcite .",
    "they prepared several ps films supported by silicon wafers with thickness from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "the measurements indicated the deduction of the @xmath2 with thickness under 400@xmath3 .",
    "an empirical relationship between thickness and @xmath2 was given as : @xmath4 , \\label{tg_reduction}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the glass transition temperature of the bulk ps .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the parameters fitted to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , @xmath10 is the thickness of the film . following keddie s work ,",
    "many researches have been done on different supported thin films of various polymers [ 2 - 3 ] by different characterization methods , such as x - ray reflectivity , positron annihilation , and dielectric @xcite .",
    "most results have demonstrated the same phenomenon that for liner polymer the @xmath2 decreases with the thickness of films .",
    "however the supported film has a considerable film - substrate interaction , which makes the conclusion controversial .",
    "strong attractive interaction between the substrate and thin film may increase the @xmath2 of thin film above the bulk @xmath2 [ 6 ] .",
    "van zanten et al . measured @xmath2 of poly-2-vinylpyridine on oxide - coated si substrates , and found it increase by @xmath11k than the bulk @xmath2 , for a @xmath12 film [ 7 ] .",
    "forrest and co - workers have done pioneer works in measuring the @xmath2 of free - standing thin films [ 8 - 10 ] .",
    "they measured the @xmath2 of free - standing ps films with thickness from @xmath13 to @xmath14 and different molecular weights by brillouin light scattering and transmission ellipsometry .",
    "their results showed that the @xmath2 decreases with the thickness of ps thin film with a much larger magnitude : for example , the @xmath2 of @xmath15 film with _ mw _ within @xmath16k to @xmath17k reduces by 70k below the @xmath5 , while this magnitude is around @xmath18k for supported films . the empirical equation ( eq.[tg_reduction ] ) derived for supported film still holds for the low _ mw _ free - standing films .",
    "with @xmath19 , the parameter @xmath20 was found to be @xmath21 which is twice of it found for supported films .",
    "other than the experimental work , computer simulation and calculation have also been developed to investigate the glass transition on surface / thin film , and most of them are for polymer systems [ 11 - 23 ] . molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo ( mc ) method were usually employed with various modelings , and confirmed the @xmath2 decrease with the thickness reduction for both supported and free standing film , or @xmath2 increase in some particular substrate - film cases .",
    "the eq.[tg_reduction ] derived from experiments can also be validated by simulations , nevertheless the explanation for the mechanism of @xmath2 reduction is still a matter of debate .",
    "most md simulations verified the experimental observation that for supported film , a strong substrate - film interaction will increase the @xmath2 above the value in the bulk , while the weak substrate - film interaction will lead @xmath2 reduction , and free - standing film shows a much larger @xmath2 reduction than supported film with weak substrate - film interaction [ 12 ] .",
    "mattice and co - workers firstly reported the mc simulation in this field [ 13 , 14 ] .",
    "de pablo et.al .",
    "reported a mc simulation on free - standing films of both linear and cyclic polymeric chains [ 23 ] .",
    "basically the @xmath2 reduction with smaller thickness was confirmed in the above investigations . in de pablo and co - workers work",

    "[ tg_reduction ] with slight difference on the parameters fitting .",
    "although the glass transition is not a unique property of polymers , most simulation works were modeled for polymer systems , while the works on small molecule systems are very rare . meanwhile , ising spins glass has also been widely utilized to study the glass transition [ 24 - 37 ] . by different lattices adopted and interactions setup the ising model is capable to describe various systems , such as gas , liquid , crystal and glass , and consequently the phase transitions , like melting and glass transition [ 24 ] . however , very few of the efforts were on surface / thin film glass transition of ising spin glass .",
    "this field had been explored by gujrati et al . by applying ising model on a modified bethe lattice to describe the thermodynamics of polymer systems near surface [ 38 - 42 ] . in this paper",
    "we follow the similar method to study the glass transition of ising spin glass on the surface / thin film on a specially constructed recursive lattice .",
    "except in some rare cases [ 43 - 45 ] , a many - body system with interactions on a regular lattice is difficult to be solved exactly because of the complexity involved with treating the combinatorics generated by the interaction terms in the hamiltonian when summing over all states .",
    "the mean - field approximation is commonly adopted to solve this problem , e.g. the flory model of semiflexible polymers [ 46 , 47 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "recursive lattices enable us to take the explicit treatment of combinatorics on these lattices and no approximation is necessary [ 25 - 28 , 48 ] . the recursive lattice is chosen to have the same coordination number as the regular lattice it is designed to describe . as usual , the coordination number @xmath22 is the number of nearest - neighbor sites of a site .",

    "transition temperatures of @xmath227and @xmath228 with other parameters fixed to be 0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig27 ] .",
    "[ ptb ]        from the graph above , we can see that the parameter @xmath46  has a similar effect to jp : positive j  will make the system more stable and increase both transition temperatures , and vice versa .",
    "we also found that , unlike the limited value of @xmath42 , @xmath46  can be assigned with large value such as @xmath228 without destroying the stable solutions .",
    "the transition temperatures variation with different @xmath46  are summarized in table 3 .",

    "this difference could be useful in modifying the parameters setup to describe the real systems or experimental results . for a real system , factors affecting the thermodynamics can act in different ways , some of them may lift / reduce both transition temperatures but keep the supercooled liquid region constant , or some may change the window size of supercooled liquid state .",
    "as mentioned above , for convenience we setup the energy parameters in the bulk and on the surface , such as @xmath42 and @xmath221 , to be the same .",
    "nevertheless , our lattice has a fixed bond length ( this length is unit @xmath24 in ising model ) between neighbor sites on the surface and in the bulk , and we also know that the asymmetric interactions and the surface tension are the main reason of unique properties of the surface . therefore with a fixed bong length , we have to somehow modify the surface interaction circumstance to mimic the surface tension or asymmetric interactions .",
    "this can only be made possible with different @xmath41 and @xmath63 setup .",
    "thus we fixed the bulk nearest - neighbor interaction parameter @xmath41 to be @xmath50 , and observe how the variation of surface bond interaction @xmath63 affect the thermodynamics on the surface .",
    "the transition temperatures change with variation of @xmath229 is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig28 ] and table 4 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig28 ] we can conclude that larger absolute value of negative @xmath63 makes the system more stable and increases both melting and ideal glass transition temperatures .",
    "the variation of @xmath63 revealed that the surface is more stable with large surface tension ( @xmath230 ) , or easier to undergo transitions than in the bulk with small surface tension ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "positive @xmath63 was also been tested however no stable solution can be reached .",
    "this is because the positive @xmath63 will prefer ferromagnetic - aligned spins arrangement which only has @xmath24-cycle solution available . on the other hand",
    "it is also hard to imagine a homogeneous system with particles attractive to each other in the bulk but repulsive on the surface .",

    "thus at high temperature one site has @xmath131 probability to be occupied by either @xmath134 or @xmath137 spin .",
    "if a non - zero value of magnetic field @xmath232 exists , we can expect the 1-cycle solution off the central @xmath130 line or asymmetric 2-cycle solutions .",
    "a positive @xmath232 will prefer more + spins and moves the 1-cycle solution higher than @xmath130 , or vice versa . in our previous research on bulk husimi lattice ,",
    "the three spins interaction ( triplet ) @xmath45 acts similarly to magnetic field @xmath232 in changing the bias of spins .",
    "however , in srl the @xmath45 and magnetic field @xmath232 are not useful , although for a general presentation we still have them in our lattice model and energy equations .",
    "the reason is that , the uneven property of the surface on srl determines the 1-cycle solution can only be @xmath130 . if a non - zero magnetic field @xmath232 or triplet interaction @xmath45 presents , the 1-cycle solution on the surface can not be achieved .",
    "the single bond unit does not have triple interaction @xmath45 and the effect of @xmath232 is much smaller than it is in the square unit , therefore the anti - aligning property of the single will always prefer to have different spins on it . in another word ,",
    "if a 1-cycle solution can be achieved on the single surface bond , it must be the @xmath130 solution .",
    "even we can still calculate the thermodynamics of 2-cycle solution on the surface , we must have the corresponding 1-cycle solution to determine the melting and ideal glass transitions .",
    "therefore , we have to abandon the variation of @xmath232 and @xmath45 , which is a disadvantage of the srl .    .",
    "we applied recursive lattice technique to investigate the thermodynamics and ideal glass transition on the surface / thin film of ising spin system with a theoretical base . a recursive lattice ( srl )",
    "were constructed to describe a regular finite size square lattice , with a 2d bulk surrounded by 1d surface .",
    "the srl utilizes the finite - sized husimi lattice , which is integrated by 2d square units , to be the bulk part , and adopts single bond to connect the finite - sized bulk parts .",
    "these single bonds and the outsider bonds of bulk trees assemble the surfaces surrounding the bulk part and slipping through independent bulk parts .",
    "the lattice is constructed with particular approximations and compromises and is believed to be reliable approximation to the regular square lattice in the aspect of coordination numbers , i.e. the number of neighbor sites is @xmath27 inside the bulk and @xmath26 on the surface .",
    "the ising spins of two possible states @xmath134 or @xmath137 are put on the sites of srl .",
    "we assigned anti - ferromagnetic interaction in the model and different spin states in neighbor pairs are preferred to be the stable state ( crystal ) .",
    "the partition function of a sub - tree with its base spin state fixed is defined as partial partition function ( ppf ) .",
    "based on the recursive properties , the ppf of one sub - tree can be expressed as a function of the ppfs of its sub - sub - trees and a local weight .",
    "this recursive relation enables us to derive the ratio of pffs on one site .",
    "this ratio is called solution from which the thermodynamics of system can be achieved by gujrati trick .",
    "two kinds of stable solutions usually can be achieved by recursive calculation .",
    "one is in 2-cycle form and represents the ordered state , the other is in 1-cycle form representing the amorphous / metastable state .",
    "the thermal behaviors of 2-cycle and 1-cycle solutions indicate the melting transition by the cross point of free energies of two solutions , and the ideal glass transition by the negative entropy of 1-cycle solution .",
    "our results agree with others work that the transition temperatures are dramatically reduced on the surface / thin film comparing which in the bulk .",
    "nevertheless our work shows that , regardless of specific properties of particular materials , either polymer or small molecules , this transition temperature reduction can be simply due to the dimension downgrade and lower interaction energy on the surface .",
    "the effects of different interaction energy parameters other than nearest - neighbor interaction such as diagonal interaction and four spins ( quadruplet ) interaction were investigated .",
    "the variation of energy parameter could either increase or decrease the stability of system and change the transition temperatures according to the hamiltonian .",
    "the behaviors of energy parameters can be used to setup a particular model to describe the real system .",
    "while our finding agrees well with others experimental and simulation results , comparing to others work , there are two advantages in our approach : 1 ) in this work our model focuses on the small molecules system , it reveals the basic dimension origin of transition temperatures reduction without involving the long chain properties of polymer system ; 2 ) the thermodynamics of systems are derived by exact calculation method , the computation time is much shorter than typical simulation methods , usually the calculation of one set of parameters in the interesting temperature region can be done in less than 100 seconds ."
