    "we are designing a fast topological trigger system  @xcite with the goal of reducing the energy threshold for detection of gamma rays by a factor of two below the threshold of current imaging atmospheric - cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) around 130  gev .",
    "this trigger will analyze in real time the trigger - maps across all telescopes in the array and thereby improve the rejection of background over the current generation of trigger systems .",
    "aspects that ultimately determine how low the energy threshold can be , include not only the speed and sophistication of the trigger , but also the memory depth in the front - end electronics and the speed of the data acquisition system",
    ". this topological trigger may be part of a veritas upgrade proposal  @xcite or it may interface with a highly integrated camera on next generation iacts , such as the advanced gamma - ray imaging system ( agis ) .",
    "the current generation of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) typically achieve gamma - ray collection areas of @xmath0  m@xmath1 above 1  tev .",
    "the gamma - ray collection area of veritas is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : collection_area ] at nominal trigger conditions ( _ solid line _ ) . the photomultiplier tube ( pmt )",
    "thresholds are set at 5  photoelectrons ( pe ) , resulting in an energy threshold at the trigger level , e@xmath2 , of e@xmath3112  gev .",
    "a lower energy threshold could be achieved by decreasing the pmt thresholds .",
    "[ fig : collection_area ] shows two scenarios of lowered pmt thresholds that result in enhanced collection area below @xmath4100  gev .",
    "however , these thresholds are not easily achievable because lowering the pmt threshold results in steeply rising data rates from background events : cosmic rays and night - sky background ( nsb ) light .",
    "rejection of background events with veritas is achieved through an efficient three - stage trigger  @xcite . at the primary level ( l1 ) ,",
    "pmts generate a trigger if at least @xmath45  pe are detected within about 3  ns . following the threshold requirement , a pattern - sensitive logic ( l2 ) searches for 3 nearest - neighbor pmts that trigger within a time span of about 7  ns .",
    "this camera trigger then sends a timing edge over optical fiber to a central station ( l3 ) .",
    "a trigger is issued by l3 only if at least 2 telescopes produced a trigger within 100  ns of each other .",
    "all parameters of the trigger setup are adjustable and were optimized for stable operation with less than 10% dead - time under a variety of observing conditions , including moon light .",
    "the trigger rates of one of the telescopes and of l3 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : array_bias ] as a function of the pmt threshold .",
    "it can be seen that cosmic rays are the main source of background at the current operating threshold of 50  mv ( equivalent to 5  pe ) . however , if the pmt threshold is reduced to 3  pe , then a trigger would have to more efficiently reject both , nsb and cosmic rays .",
    "[ fig : array_bias ] indicates that at a threshold of 3  pe , the efficiency for rejection of nsb must be improved by @xmath5 and that of cosmic rays by 70% .",
    "such a background reduction is possible if the stereo images ( trigger maps ) could be analyzed in real time at the array level .",
    "we are developing a trigger that implements a geometrical algorithm at the array level to reject more efficiently both , nsb and cosmic rays . in turn",
    ", the reduced background rate would allow the energy threshold to be lowered without increasing the telescope dead - time .",
    "30  mv ( about 3  pe ) without increasing the dead - time .",
    ", width=288 ]",
    "the topological trigger consists of high - speed camera - level triggers that transmit image parameters to the array trigger for real - time event classification .",
    "the design is implemented with field - programmable gate arrays ( fpgas ) that allow the trigger to be adaptable to different observing modes ( e.g. a ring - shaped acceptance region for low - energy pulsar studies ) or concurrent special physics triggers ( e.g. searching for short bursts of gamma rays ) .    while the design is flexible in the specific deployment , the hardware specification were chosen so as to be compatible with veritas . in order to maintain a responsive system with a dead - time of less than 10 the first level of the topological trigger ( l1.5 )",
    "samples the discriminated camera signals at a rate of 400 mhz and searches for hits of three nearest neighbor pixels .",
    "there are three l1.5 cards per camera .",
    "the time window to detect coincidences is programmable to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio for detection of gamma rays .",
    "a fast l1.5 is essential since gamma - ray events as imaged by the telescope are of @xmath45  ns duration .",
    "currently , veritas is operating with a 7  ns coincidence window on each telescope .",
    "the increased speed alone makes it possible to lower the energy threshold without increasing the single - telescope trigger rate . to achieve the required level of timing accuracy across the camera , programmable delay lines",
    "are implemented on l1.5 .",
    "this is necessary since nonuniform delays between pixels are introduced by cable lengths and variations in the high - voltage .",
    "the processing speed of l1.5 is well matched to the 2 ns samples recorded by the fadcs and facilitate an appropriate reduction of the energy threshold in the off - line analysis .",
    "the hit pixels are then sent to a second trigger level ( l2 ) that parameterizes the image shape and transmits this information along with the gps time stamp to the array - level trigger ( l3 ) at a rate of 10 mhz via a fiber optic link .",
    "the fpga - based event analysis on l3 searches for coincident time - stamps from multiple telescopes and carries out a comparison of the image parameters against a look - up table at a rate of up to 10  khz .",
    "we have identified an algorithm  @xcite , described below , that is relatively simple to implement on l3 and is suitable for gamma / hadron separation below 100  gev .",
    "the algorithm we intend to implement on l3 is based on the parallactic of shower - images seen from different points on the ground . as described in  @xcite ,",
    "only a first moment - parameterization of each image is required and is practical to implement within the limited time of @xmath410  @xmath6s available for data transmission and image processing .",
    "the method is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : parallactic ] for a gamma - ray and a cosmic - ray primary arriving on - axis .",
    "gamma rays produce narrow and well - defined images in each telescope , while cosmic rays produce sub - showers and result in erratic distribution of the cherenkov light between telescopes .",
    "the parallactic displacement results from the different view points of telescopes on the ground and displaces the image away from the camera center . by drawing lines through the image centroid and the camera center",
    ", pairs of telescopes produce an intersection . by projecting the intersecting lines on the ground ,",
    "the impact location is reconstructed .",
    "the spread of the pair - wise intersecting points is smaller for gamma rays than for cosmic rays .",
    "the figure of merit , called _ parallaxwidth _ , is defined by the coordinates of the intersecting points , @xmath7 , for each telescopes @xmath8 , and the average over all such intersections , @xmath9 : @xmath10        the efficiency of the _ parallaxwidth _ parameter in separating gamma rays from cosmic rays is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parallax_dist ] for an array of 50 telescopes .",
    "gamma rays were simulated at 100  gev , while cosmic rays were drawn from a power - law distribution with index -2.7 between 50  gev and 10  tev .",
    "the arrival direction for both , gamma and cosmic rays is on - axis , with telescopes pointed at zenith . since",
    "cosmic rays are distributed isotropically , we are presenting a worst - case scenario for suppression of cosmic rays since off - axis cosmic rays will have even larger spread in the parallaxwidth parameter .",

    "[ fig : parallax_dist ] results from a minimum of 3 telescopes participating with a pmt threshold of 3.5  pe .",

    "a proof - of - principle trigger system is currently being developed by iowa state university and argonne national lab .",
    "the hardware necessary for a complete single - telescope trigger has been produced and verified in the lab .",
    "the trigger resides in one vme crate containing three l1.5 cards , one l2 card , and thirteen input / output ( i / o ) cards .",
    "the i / o cards are necessary to test the topological trigger on a veritas telescope without disturbing night - time observations . for l3 ,",
    "we have purchased a pci - based fpga card from faster technology that features four fiber optical connections to the telescopes .",
    "the signal routing from the i / o cards to the l1.5 cards occurs over a custom backplane with gigabit connectors .",
    "the operation of the l1.5 cards has been verified at 400  mhz through direct pattern injection into the i / o cards .",
    "testing of the trigger was conducted in parallel with the standard trigger during late march 2009 on a single veritas telescope .",
    "the fpga architecture includes adjustable front - end input delays to equalize the trigger arrival - times across all channels .",
    "variations arise due to cable lengths and high - voltage settings .",
    "delays up to 5  ns can be accommodated in the fpga and are programmable with a precision of 0.078  ns .",
    "the measured timing distribution before and after compensating for the delay - variations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay ] . following the delay - line calibration ,",
    "simultaneous measurements were taken of the trigger rate versus pmt threshold , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias ] .",
    "we observe a reduction in the night - sky accidentals by 50% and an increase of the cosmic - ray rate by 20% .",
    "the reduction in the night - sky background ( nsb ) rate is expected due to the faster coincidence logic ( 6  ns vs. 7 ns window ) . the increased cosmic - ray rate may be due to a larger trigger area at the edge of the field of view ( 10% ) , and the fact that delay corrections are not applied to the veritas trigger inputs .",
    "the single - telescope trigger test was thus successful and we anticipate further reducing the nsb rate by shortening the coincidence window to 3  ns through firmware development .",
    "we would like to thank the veritas collaboration for use of the telescope and support during the trigger test .",
    "this research is supported by iowa state university , argonne national lab through the ldrd program , and the us department of energy through the advanced detector research program ( defg0207er41497 ) ."
