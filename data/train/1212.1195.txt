    "long - range rapidity correlations between pairs of hadrons produced at small azimuthal angles with respect to each other were discovered recently in heavy ion ( @xmath3 ) @xcite , proton  proton ( @xmath4 ) @xcite , and proton  nucleus ( @xmath5 ) collisions @xcite . due to the particular shape of the corresponding correlation function , with a narrow correlation in the azimuthal angle @xmath2 and a wide correlation in pseudo - rapidity separation @xmath6 , these correlations are often referred to as the `` ridge '' .",
    "there appears to be a consensus in the community that the origin of these long - range rapidity correlations is in the very early - time dynamics immediately following the collision .",
    "a simple causality argument demonstrates that a correlation between two hadrons produced far apart in rapidity may arise only in their common causal past , that is , in the early stages of the collision @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed dynamical origin of these `` ridge '' correlations is not completely clear .",
    "it has been proposed in the literature @xcite that the `` ridge '' correlations may arise in the classical gluon field dynamics of the parton saturation physics / color glass condensate ( cgc ) .",
    "( for reviews of saturation / cgc physics see @xcite . )",
    "indeed classical gluon fields , which in the mclerran  venugopalan ( mv ) model @xcite dominate gluon production in heavy ion collisions , do lead to a rapidity - independent distribution of the produced gluons @xcite over rapidity intervals of up to @xmath7 , which is the upper limit of their validity ( with @xmath8 the strong coupling constant ) . correlations between such classical fields , introduced in the process of averaging over their color sources , do have a long range in rapidity @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was observed in @xcite that the diagrams giving rise to such rapidity correlations also lead to a narrow correlation in the azimuthal direction , in qualitative agreement with the shape of the `` ridge '' correlation .",
    "one has to keep in mind that in heavy ion collisions the early - stage azimuthal correlation may be washed out by the final state interactions leading to thermalization of the produced medium and its hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "( note though , that the rapidity correlation is not likely to be strongly affected by such late - time dynamics . )",
    "it was argued , however , that the effect of the radial flow in the hydrodynamic evolution of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) would be to ( re-)introduce the azimuthal correlations @xcite .    another potential complication with the cgc explanation of the `` ridge '' is the fact that rapidity - dependent corrections to classical gluon fields do become important at rapidity of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "these corrections come in through the non - linear balitsky  kovchegov ( bk ) @xcite and jalilian - marian  iancu  mclerran  weigert  leonidov  kovner ( jimwlk ) @xcite evolution equations .",
    "rapidity - dependent corrections are very important for describing the hadron multiplicity distribution in rapidity , @xmath10 , in the cgc framework @xcite .",
    "as @xmath10 does depend on rapidity rather strongly in rhic heavy ion data , and also strongly ( albeit less so ) in the lhc data , it is very hard to describe without the rapidity - dependent nonlinear evolution .",
    "it is possible that similar rapidity - dependent corrections may significantly affect and potentially destroy the long - range structure of the rapidity correlations due to classical gluon fields of the mv model .",
    "note that progress on this issue has been made in @xcite , indicating that inclusion of small-@xmath11 evolution still leaves the `` ridge '' reasonably flat in rapidity until @xmath12 when the correlation disappears .    to elucidate the above questions and concerns , and to improve the precision of the cgc predictions for the `` ridge''-like correlations , it is important to be able to calculate the two - particle correlation in the cgc framework beyond the lowest order . while some works do consider the role of small-@xmath11 evolution and multiple rescatterings in the correlation function @xcite , most of the phenomenological approaches @xcite simply include the saturation effects into the lowest - order calculation by evolving the unintegrated gluon distributions with the running - coupling bk ( rcbk ) nonlinear evolution @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to begin to analytically include saturation effects into the two - gluon correlation function in nucleus  nucleus collisions",
    ". indeed full inclusion analytic of saturation effects originating in both nuclei would be a very hard problem : even the single gluon production in the quasi - classical mv limit of @xmath3 collisions can be dealt with only numerically at present @xcite . to make the problem more tractable we assume that one of the colliding nuclei is much larger than the other one , such that saturation effects are important only in interactions with the larger nucleus . in a more formal language @xcite for the quasi - classical mv model , we assume that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the atomic numbers of the smaller and larger nuclei , while @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ". equivalently one can say that we are interested in production of gluons with transverse momentum @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the saturation scale of the smaller nucleus .",
    "we do not impose any constraints on @xmath20 compared to the saturation scale @xmath21 of the larger nucleus ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we stress here that this setup is not what is usually referred to as the @xmath5 collision in the saturation / cgc terminology : since @xmath23 , the two gluon production cross section is dominated by the gluons produced in interactions of _ different _ nucleons in the smaller nucleus , which may also be viewed as a lowest - order saturation correction .",
    "below we calculate the two - gluon production cross section and the corresponding correlation function including the all - order saturation effects in the larger nucleus , while keeping them to the lowest non - trivial order in the smaller nucleus .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] we set up the problem . in the process of properly defining the correlation function",
    "we unexpectedly find a correlation originating in a simple fact that the nucleons in both nuclei are confined to within the nuclear radii .",
    "the effect is quite generic , and is not specific to the saturation / cgc approach used in the calculations in much of this paper : this correlation should be present in any model of @xmath3 collisions which properly takes into account the geometry of the collision .",
    "we refer to these correlations as the `` geometric correlations '' .",
    "we argue that this effect gives a non - trivial contribution to the correlator even if the two - gluon production cross section is given by disconnected feynman diagrams , i.e. , the correlation is not generated dynamically in the interactions .",
    "this correlation may be long - range in rapidity , though it does not have any non - trivial azimuthal structure .",

    "[ sec : longrange ] in terms of the wilson line correlators .",
    "we show that the two - gluon production cross section is related to various correlators of four adjoint wilson lines : the adjoint dipole , quadrupole , and a double - trace operator .",

    "we evaluate the wilson - line correlators describing the interaction with the target nucleus using the quasi - classical mv approximation and the large-@xmath24 limit . by analyzing the two - gluon correlation function at the lowest non - trivial order , and in agreement with the earlier calculations in the literature",
    "@xcite , we find both the near - side ( @xmath1 ) and away - side ( @xmath25 ) long - range rapidity correlations .",
    "( here @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle between the momenta of the produced gluons . )",
    "the two correlations are identical in their azimuthal shapes ( as functions of @xmath2 ) , such that the correlator can be expanded into a fourier series in terms of only the even harmonics @xmath26 .",
    "we discuss the possibility that such non - flow correlation may complicate experimental extraction of the contribution of the true qgp flow to the flow observables @xmath27 .",
    "in addition to the geometric and long - range rapidity correlations , the obtained two - gluon production cross section contains hanbury - brown  twiss ( hbt ) correlations @xcite .",

    "we denote by @xmath282 the interaction with a single nucleon by a two - gluon exchange : it is a matrix in the color space of the @xmath272-channel gluons . since in the correlator the top ( bottom ) two @xmath272-channel gluons are in the color - singlet state both before and after the interaction , we write @xmath283 \\ , tr [ u_{{\\bm x}_3 } u_{{\\bm x}_4}^\\dagger ]    \\rangle = \\langle p_1 | e^{\\hat m } | p_1 \\rangle . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding the exponential in a power series and inserting unit operators @xmath284 between all the @xmath282 s yields @xmath285 \\ , tr [ u_{{\\bm x}_3 } u_{{\\bm x}_4}^\\dagger ]    \\rangle = \\left ( e^m \\right)_{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath286 matrix @xmath287 is defined by its elements , @xmath288 all one has to do now is to find the matrix @xmath287 from , exponentiate it , picking up the `` @xmath289 '' matrix element of the exponential .",
    "such a calculation , while straightforward , is rather involved : here we will utilize the large-@xmath24 limit to construct an approximate result .",

    "see that if we start in the color - singlet state @xmath291 for the top ( bottom ) gluon pair , a single interaction can either leave the two gluons in the color - singlet state , or can flip them into a color - octet state @xmath292 .",
    "the latter transition comes in with an order-@xmath293 suppression factor . in order to evaluate we have to start and finish with a color - singlet state : to order-@xmath139",

    "<S> we study two - particle long - range rapidity correlations arising in the early stages of heavy ion collisions in the saturation / color glass condensate framework , assuming for simplicity that one colliding nucleus is much larger than the other . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the two - gluon production cross section while including all - order saturation effects in the heavy nucleus with the lowest - order rescattering in the lighter nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we find four types of correlations in the two - gluon production cross section : ( i ) geometric correlations , ( ii ) hbt correlations accompanied by a back - to - back maximum , ( iii ) away - side correlations , and ( iv ) near - side azimuthal correlations which are long - range in rapidity . the geometric correlations ( i ) are due to the fact that nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus and may lead to long - range rapidity correlations for the produced particles without strong azimuthal angle dependence . somewhat surprisingly , long - range rapidity correlations ( iii ) and ( iv ) have exactly the same amplitudes along with azimuthal and rapidity shapes : one centered around @xmath0 with the other one centered around @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle between the two produced gluons ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus observe that the early - time cgc dynamics in nucleus - nucleus collisions generates azimuthal non - flow correlations which are qualitatively different from jet correlations by being long - range in rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> if strong enough , they have the potential of mimicking the elliptic ( and higher - order even - harmonic ) flow in the di - hadron correlators : one may need to take them into account in the experimental determination of the flow observables . </S>"
