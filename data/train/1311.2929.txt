    "since however the estimate has been used mainly to prove the convergence rate of the glimm scheme , we felt necessary to offer also a direct proof for this approximation scheme .",
    "it turns out that even if the fundamental ideas are the same , the two proofs are sufficiently different in some points to justify a separate analysis . in our opinion , in fact , it is not trivial to deduce one from the other .      as observed in @xcite , one of the main problems in obtaining an estimate of the form , is that the study of wave interactions can not be local in time , but one has to take into accoun the whole sequence of interactions - cancellations for every couple of waves .",
    "this is a striking difference with the glimm interaction potential @xmath94 , where the past history of the solution is irrelevant .",
    "previous attempts tried to adapt glimm s idea of finding a _ quadratic potential @xmath95 _ which is decreasing in time and at every interaction has a jump of the amount .",
    "apart technical variations , the idea is to transform the function @xmath18 of into @xmath96 : = \\sum_{w \\not= w ' } \\frac{|\\sigma(w ) -",
    "\\sigma(w')| |w| |w'|}{|w| + |w'|}.\\ ] ] for monotone initial data @xmath31 , this functional is sufficient ; however in @xcite f. ancona and a. marson show that @xmath95 defined above may be not bounded , so that in @xcite they consider the functional @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the position of the wave @xmath13 at time @xmath19 .",
    "notice that at the time of interaction of the wavefronts @xmath13 , @xmath14 one has @xmath99 ( there are no wavefronts between the two interacting ) , so that for the couple of waves @xmath13 , @xmath14 one has @xmath100    if the flux function @xmath101 has no finite inflection points , the waves @xmath102 can join in wavefronts ( because of an interaction ) and split again ( because of a cancellation ) an arbitrary large number of times .",
    "this implies that the functional @xmath103 ( as well as the other quadratic functionals introduced in the literature ) does not decay in time , but can increase due to cancellations .",
    "hence , instead of proving directly that the quadratic functional @xmath104 controls the interactions , in @xcite the authors consider a term @xmath105 which bounds the oscillations of @xmath104 for the waves not involved in an interaction , and prove that @xmath106 } \\frac{|\\sigma - \\sigma'| s s'}{s + s ' } \\leq ( q^\\text{{am}}(t_1 ) + g(t_1 ) ) - \\big ( q^\\text{{am}}(t_2 ) + g(t_2 ) \\big).\\ ] ] since @xmath103 is quadratic by construction because of the lipschitz regularity of the speed @xmath15 ( inequality ) and @xmath107 , @xmath108 , they reduce the quadratic interaction estimate to the following estimate : @xmath109    our approach is slightly different : we construct a quadratic functional @xmath110 such that its total variation in time is bounded by @xmath111 , and at any interaction decays at least of the quantity ( or more precisely of the quantities in the l.h.s . of or concerning that interaction ) . the functional can increase due to cancellations , but in this case we show that its positive variation is controlled by the total variation of the solution times the amount of cancellation . being the total variation a lyapunov functional , it follows that @xmath112 so that , being @xmath113 , the functional @xmath114 has total variation of the order of @xmath115 . in particular , @xmath116 the estimates , concerning cancellations is much easier ( and already done in the literature , see @xcite ) , and we present it in propositions [ w_canc_3 ] , [ canc_3 ] , depending on the approximation scheme considered . in the case of cancellations , in fact , there is a first order functional decreasing , namely the total variation .    for simplicity we present the sketch of the proof in the wavefront tracking case",
    "we define again a functional @xmath0 of a form similar to , @xmath117 but with @xmath118 main differences .    1 .",
    "first of all its definition involves the waves @xmath35 , not the wavefronts @xmath13 .",

    "this makes @xmath0 not local in time and space .",
    "the denominator of is not the total variation of @xmath26 between two wavefronts @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( containing @xmath35 , @xmath119 respectively ) as it is the case in , but only the total variation between the two waves @xmath35 , @xmath119 . observe that @xmath125    by the lipschitz regularity of the speed given to the waves by solving a riemann problem , it is fairly easy ( and proved in section [ w_functional_q ] ) that @xmath126    we observe first that the functional @xmath110 restricted to the couple of waves which have never interacted is exactly ( apart from the constant @xmath121 ) the original glimm functional @xmath127 : = \\sum_{w \\not= w ' } |w| |w'|.\\ ] ] since the couple of waves which have never interacted is decreasing , this part of the functional is decreasing , and as observed before it is sufficient to control the quadratic estimates for couple of waves which have never interacted .    the choice of the denominator in yields that our functional @xmath128 is not affected by the issue of large oscillations , as observed in @xcite , even if its form is similar to @xmath103 : indeed , in our case",
    ", the denominator we choose does not depend on the shock component which the waves belong to , and thus cancellations do not affect it .",
    "next , the riemann problem used to compute the quantity @xmath124 is made of all waves @xmath129 which have interacted with both waves @xmath35 and @xmath119 .",
    "we now show how it evolves with time .",
    "interaction : :    if at @xmath130 an interaction occurs , and @xmath35 ,    @xmath119 are not involved in the interaction , the set of waves    which have interacted with both is not changing ( since they are    separated , at most one of them is involved in the interaction ! ) , which    means that    @xmath131 .",
    "if    @xmath35 , @xmath119 are involved in the interaction ,    then the couple disappears from the sum , because when two wavefronts    with the same sign interact a single wavefront comes out .",

    "otherwise the change in @xmath132 corresponds to the    change in speed obtained by removing some waves in a riemann problem ,    and adding all these variations one obtains that the oscillation of    @xmath110 can be estimated explicitly as in the case    of a single cancellation ( i.e. the total variation of the solution    times the amount of cancellation ) .    the cancellation case , corresponding to the positive total variation in time of @xmath110 , is thus controlled by @xmath133 and since @xmath113 and @xmath134 it follows that @xmath135    when an interaction between @xmath13 , @xmath14 occurs , the discussion above shows that we can split the waves involved in the interaction into @xmath118 sets :    1 .   a set @xmath136 of waves in @xmath13 which have never interacted with the waves in @xmath14 ; 2 .   a set @xmath137 of waves in @xmath13 which have interacted with a set @xmath138 of waves in @xmath14 ; 3 .   a set @xmath139 of waves in @xmath14 which have never interacted with the waves in @xmath13 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s_convex_env ] provides some useful results on convex envelopes .",
    "part of these results are already present in the literature , others can be deduced with little effort .",
    "we decided to collect them for reader s convenience .",
    "two particular estimates play a key role in the main body of the paper : the regularity of the speed function ( theorem [ convex_fundamental_thm ] and proposition [ convex_fundamental_thm_affine ] ) and the behavior of the speed assigned to a wave by the solution to riemann problem @xmath92 $ ] when the left state @xmath143 or the right state @xmath144 are varied ( propositions [ tocca ] , [ vel_aumenta ] , [ differenza_vel ] and [ incastro ] ) .",
    "the next two sections contain the main results of the paper . as we said , for technical reasons",
    "the proofs differ depending on the approximation scheme considered , but , in order to simplify the exposition , we tried to keep a similar structure of both sections .",
    "section [ sect_wavefront ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ w_main_thm ] .",
    "after recalling how a wavefront approximated solution @xmath25 is constructed , we begin with the construction of the wave map @xmath74 in section [ front_waves ] . as we said , due to the fixed size @xmath71 of the waves , the set of waves @xmath145 will be a finite subset of @xmath146 , and we replace the properties of @xmath74 given at the beginning of this introduction with the ( easier to work with ) definition of _ enumeration of waves _ , definition [ w_eow ] .",
    "this is the triple @xmath147 , where @xmath74 is the position of the waves @xmath35 and @xmath148 is its right state .",
    "the equivalence of the two definitions is straightforward . in section [ w_pswaves ]",
    "we show that it is possible to construct a function @xmath36 such that at any time @xmath149 is an enumeration of waves , with @xmath148 independent on @xmath19 .",

    "first we study the estimate when a single cancellation occurs .",
    "this estimate is standard , since the cancellation is controlled by the decay of a first order functional , namely @xmath150 .",
    "the precise estimate is reported in proposition [ w_canc_3 ] , where the dependence w.r.t . @xmath150 and",
    "@xmath121 is singled out .",
    "corollary [ w_canc_4 ] completes the estimate for the case of cancellation points .",

    "this proposition proves for the case of interaction points , completing the proof of theorem [ w_main_thm ] .",
    "as we said , one of the main features of the enumeration of waves is that we can speak of couple of waves which have already interacted . in section [ w_waves_collision ]",
    "we prove some important properties of these couples of waves .",
    "lemma [ w_interagite_stesso_segno ] shows that they must have the same sign , and , because in the scalar case no new waves are created , all the waves between @xmath35 and @xmath119 have interacted with @xmath35 and @xmath119 , lemma [ w_quelle_in_mezzo_hanno_int ] . in this section",
    "it is also defined the interval of waves @xmath151 , which is the set of waves @xmath152 which have interacted with both @xmath35 and @xmath119 .",
    "propositions [ w_unite_realta ] and [ w_divise_tocca ] prove that , even if the solution to the riemann problem generated by the waves @xmath151 assigns artificial speeds to @xmath35 , @xmath119 , the property of being separated or not in the real solution can be deduced from the solution to the riemann problem @xmath151 . from this fact",
    "we can infer a lot of interesting properties of the riemann problem @xmath151 : the most important one is that we can know the values @xmath26 where @xmath153 .    in section [ w_functional_q ]",

    "we study separately the behavior of @xmath110 at interactions and cancellations .",
    "theorem [ w_decreasing ] proves that the functional @xmath110 decreases at least of the quantity at a single interaction point , while theorem [ w_increasing ] shows that the increase of @xmath110 at each cancellation point is controlled by the total variation of the solution times the cancellation .",
    "these two facts conclude the proof of proposition [ w_thm_interaction ] , as shown in section [ sss_sketch_proof ] .",
    "section [ s_glimm_scheme ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ main_thm ] .",
    "as we said , the ideas of the proof are similar , but from the technical point of view there are substantial differences , making this case slightly more complicated . in this introduction",
    "we will underline these variations , so that the reader can easily pass from one proof to the other , also because we tried to keep the structure of the two main sections similar .",
    "as we already said , the first main difference is in the definition of enumeration of waves , definition [ eow ] .",
    "in fact , for the glimm scheme the set of waves @xmath145 is a subset of an interval in the real line ( namely @xmath154 $ ] ) , and moreover the map @xmath46 has to pass trough the grid points .",
    "this forces us to define the speed @xmath37 of a wave @xmath35 at time @xmath19 not by just taking the time - derivative of @xmath36 , but by considering the real speed given to @xmath35 by the riemann problem at each grid point as in .",
    "this analysis is done in section [ pswaves ] .",
    "another difference is that the glimm scheme , due to the choice of the sampling points , `` interacts '' with the solution ( i.e. it may alter the curve @xmath46 ) even when no real interaction - cancellation occurs .",
    "this is why we need to study an additional case , namely when no interaction / cancellation of waves occurs at a given grid point , and this is done in proposition [ p_no_interaction ] : the statement is that trivially nothing is going on in these points , but we felt the need of a proof .",
    "proposition [ canc_3 ] , namely the case of cancellation points , is analog to the wavefront tracking case . also the structure and",
    "properties of the functional @xmath110 we are going to construct in the glimm scheme case are similar to the wavefront approximation analysis , the main difference being that several interactions and cancellations occur at each time step .",
    "we thus require that the set of pairs of waves present in the solution at time step @xmath155 ( i.e. not moved to @xmath156 ) , namely @xmath157 , can be split into two parts : one part concerns the interactions , and decreases of the right amount , the other one concerns cancellations and increases of a quantity controlled by the total variation of the solution times the amount of cancellation .",
    "the remain part of the section is the proof of these two estimates , from which one deduces theorem [ main_thm ] along the same line outlined in section [ sss_sketch_proof ] .",
    "first , we define the notion of waves which have already interacted , definition [ d_glimm_interacted ] , and waves which are separated ( or _ divided _ ) , definition [ waves_divided ] .",
    "notice that even if they occupy the same grid position for some time step , they are considered divided in the real solution if the riemann problem at that grid point assigns different speeds to them .",
    "the statement that the artificial riemann problems we consider separate waves as in the real solution is completely similar to the wavefront case , proposition [ unite_realta ] , but the proof is quite longer .    in the last section , section [ ss_glimm_funct_q ]",
    "we define the functional @xmath110 , and due to the continuity of the set of waves @xmath145 we show a regularity property of the weight @xmath158 so that no measurability issues arise .",
    "the proof of the two estimates ( interactions and cancellations ) is somehow longer than in the wavefront tracking case but it is based on the same ideas , and this concludes the section .    in appendix [ app_conter ] we present a counterexample to formula ( 4.84 ) in lemma 2 , pag .",
