    "theoretical calculations of the polarizations involving the @xmath1 spin , , and the transverse spin of the lepton , , at the @xmath11 or even lower levels , in comparison with experimental measurements will provide tests of : ( a ) the standard model , ( b ) radiative corrections to the standard model , and ( c ) new physics beyond the standard model . for the latter we will look at the effects of charged doublet majorons @xcite on the polarizations .",
    "as we shall show , without any radiative corrections , in the case @xmath12 decay , the standard model predicts polarizations around 1% ; radiative corrections modify these at the @xmath13 level with a 10% change as the mass of the higgs varying between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these effects are larger when the lepton momentum is parallel to the quantization axis for the @xmath1 spin ; unfortunately , due to angular momentum conservation , the rate is very small , and vanishes in the limit @xmath16",
    ".    we shall be more interested in triple correlation , , where is the momentum difference of the outgoing lepton and neutrino .",
    "the polarizations in this correlation are proportional to the imaginary parts of the decay amplitudes .",
    "radiative corrections in the standard model yield polarizations at the order of @xmath17 ; however , one loop correction due to the exchange of charged majorons can result in significantly larger polarizations .",
    "in section [ polkin ] we obtain various polarization expressions in terms of the matrix elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 in @xmath1 decays . in section [ radcorr ] radiative corrections are evaluated to one loop , both in the standard model and the doublet majoron model .",
    "results are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "in the case which neutrinos are left handed and massless , the most general @xmath20 vertex has the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are dimensionless quantities to be evaluated . to the lowest order , we have @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as will be shown below , the polarizations of leptons depend only on @xmath26 , thus the radiative corrections to @xmath18 which are small can be ignored . in any case @xmath18",
    "is determined by the the rate of @xmath27 .",
    "in addition the corrections to @xmath19 are kept to the lowest order in @xmath28 . since this factor already appears in the definition of @xmath19 in eq .",
