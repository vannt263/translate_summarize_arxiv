    "then we proceed by the method described at the beginning of this section .",
    "since the flattenable arrangements are the main tool in the construction in the previous section , it is natural to ask whether every arrangement of segments can be flattened . a necessary condition for an arrangement to be flattenable is the existence of a line crossing all the segments , in a sufficiently flattened realization .",

    "an _ arrangement of pseudosegments _ is a set of simple curves in the plane such that every two of the curves have at most one common point and any such point is a proper crossing . if @xmath46 is an arrangement of pseudosegments , then each curve from @xmath46 , and also any curve @xmath101 such that @xmath102 is an arrangement of pseudosegments , is called a _",

    "both @xmath103 and @xmath104 cut the plane into two connected regions .",
    "since the subgraph of @xmath97 induced by the grid and short vertices is connected and separated from the frame cycle by the joining vertices , the union of the grid and short pseudosegments is connected and disjoint from @xmath103 .",
    "thus we can without loss of generality assume that all the grid and short pseudosegments lie in the region @xmath105 bounded by @xmath103 .",
    "the order of the intersections of the joining pseudosegments with @xmath103 along the boundary of @xmath105 is uniquely determined .",
    "each grid pseudosegment together with its two joining pseudosegments divides @xmath105 into two connected components .",

    "connected components and the `` horizontal '' order of the vertical pseudosegments is uniquely determined .",
    "each horizontal pseudosegment has to start in the leftmost region and end in the rightmost region and is forced to cross the vertical pseudosegments in the same order and orientation .",
    "similarly each vertical pseudosegments has to cross all the horizontal pseudosegments in the same order and orientation .",
    "it follows that the grid pseudosegments form a `` pseudogrid '' homeomorphic to the grid in figure  [ obr_3_noncross ] .",
    "therefore , we can further assume that the grid pseudosegments are straight - line segments forming a regular square grid .",
    "label the vertical and the horizontal segments of the grid consecutively by @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the odd - numbered segments form a _ coarse _ grid of @xmath108 _ big _ squares .",
    "each of the eight short pseudosegments is contained in one of the big squares , since for each orthogonal pair @xmath109 of the even - labeled grid segments , the big square determined by the segments @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the only face in the arrangement @xmath112 intersected by both @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( here @xmath115 denotes the set of short pseudosegments in @xmath46 ) .",

    "it follows that @xmath77 can intersect at most @xmath22 big squares in one traversal , and at most @xmath118 big squares in two traversals .",
    "now suppose that @xmath77 starts outside and ends inside the grid .",
    "suppose further that @xmath77 intersects @xmath3 big squares during the first traversal and then @xmath44 big squares after entering the grid for the second time .",
    "then @xmath77 has to cross at least @xmath119 coarse grid segments .",
    "since @xmath77 avoids one of the boundary segments , we have @xmath120 .",
    "if @xmath77 starts and ends inside the grid and intersects @xmath3 big squares before it reaches the boundary of the grid for the first time , @xmath44 during the following traversal , and @xmath121 after it enters the grid for the second time , it has to cross at least @xmath122 coarse grid segments .",
    "that gives us @xmath123 .",
    "it follows that any pseudosegment can intersect at most @xmath40 big squares , thus at most @xmath40 short pseudosegments .",

    "see figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_core ] , right . as all the right endpoints are close to @xmath65 , the points @xmath129 , @xmath132 and @xmath135 are also close to @xmath65 since they are to the right from the right endpoint of @xmath134 or @xmath131 , and to the left from the right endpoint of @xmath133 or @xmath130 .",

    "since all the vertices of @xmath139 are close to @xmath65 , the left endpoint of @xmath140 is close to @xmath65 as well , a contradiction .    by lemma  [ lemma_core ]",
    ", we only have to add some other segments to @xmath9 so that in any realization of the resulting arrangement @xmath46 in the plane such that all segments cross a common line @xmath125 , the subarrangement @xmath9 ( together with the line @xmath125 ) is homeomorphic to the arrangement in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_core ] , left .",
    "we add @xmath141 segments parallel to @xmath130 and @xmath141 segments parallel to @xmath133 , so that they form an @xmath142 grid as in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_grid ] .",
    "all these @xmath143 segments are called _ grid _ segments . as in the construction in the previous section , by taking every odd grid segment we get a coarse @xmath144 grid .",
    "these segments are denoted by @xmath145 and @xmath146 and drawn by full lines in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_grid ] .",
    "we add @xmath147 _ short _ segments to @xmath147 cells of the coarse grid along the diagonal , each short segment crossing two ( even ) grid segments .",
    "we obtain an arrangement @xmath148 where the intersections between segments are defined by the drawing in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_grid ] .    to get the final arrangement @xmath46 , we add a frame and some joining segments , as in the construction in the previous section .",
    "we add one joining segment for each @xmath134 and @xmath131 , and two joining segments for each grid segment . in total , we add @xmath149 joining segments connected to every other segment of a cycle of length @xmath150 .",
    "it is easy to ensure that all the added segments still cross the line @xmath125 ; see figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_frame ] for an example with smaller grid .",
    "now we fix an arbitrary ( sufficiently flattened ) realization @xmath151 of @xmath46 such that there is a line @xmath125 crossing all segments from @xmath151 .    by the same argument as in the previous section , the grid segments form a grid homeomorphic to the grid in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_grid ] . the line @xmath125 can pass through at most @xmath147 cells of the coarse grid , since it crosses two of the segments @xmath152 when entering and leaving the grid , and one other segment @xmath153 or @xmath154 between every two cells in the coarse grid .",
    "each of the @xmath147 short segments has to lie in the same cell as in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_grid ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath125 passes exactly through these @xmath147 cells and also in the same order as in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_grid ] . as a consequence",
    "we get that the orientation of the segments @xmath145 and @xmath146 induced by the grid is consistent with the left - right orientation induced by the line @xmath125 , as in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_grid ] .",
    "the segment @xmath140 has to lie inside the same @xmath155 subgrid of the coarse grid as in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_grid ] .",
    "moreover , since it crosses @xmath125 , it also has to start and end in the same two cells ( but the cells it passes through are not uniquely determined ) .",
    "since both @xmath134 and @xmath131 are connected to the frame between specific pairs of grid segments , one of their endpoints lies outside the grid and the other endpoint lies in the same cell as in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_grid ] .",
    "we can restrict the position of @xmath134 and @xmath131 even further . since @xmath134 crosses the short segment @xmath156",
    ", it has to pass through the corresponding cell . as a consequence",
    "we get that the intersection of @xmath134 with @xmath125 lies `` below '' the intersection of @xmath140 with @xmath125 , otherwise @xmath134 would cross @xmath140 or cross @xmath157 twice .",
    "similarly , as @xmath131 crosses @xmath158 , it has to cross @xmath125 `` above '' the intersection of @xmath140 with @xmath125 . also , by the same reason , starting from the endpoint inside of the grid , both @xmath134 and @xmath131 cross @xmath125 before they cross @xmath133 or @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , the sub - arrangement of @xmath124 and @xmath125 in @xmath151 is homeomorphic to the arrangement in figure  [ obr_4_nonflat_core ] and the proof of theorem  [ veta_crossable_nonflat ] is finished .",
