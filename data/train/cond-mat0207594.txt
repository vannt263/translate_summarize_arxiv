    "to date there has been no consensus for the mechanism of cuprate superconductivity .",
    "the diverging views are primarily due to complications incurred by competing orders in these strongly correlated doped mott insulators .  @xcite the competing orders can result in a variety of phases in the ground state , depending on whether the cuprate is hole doped ( p - type ) or electron doped ( n - type ) , and also on the carrier doping level , the electronic coupling strength between neighboring cuo@xmath1 planes , and the degree of disorder.@xcite in order to sort through the complications , it is necessary to identify universal characteristics among all cuprate superconductors .    among the noteworthy phenomena associated with the cuprates , @xmath2-wave pairing symmetry,@xcite spin fluctuations,@xcite pseudogap phenomenon,@xcite strong phase fluctuations@xcite and stripe phases@xcite have been considered as important to the underlying mechanism . in particular , the pseudogap phenomenon is widely regarded as a precursor to superconductivity , and its doping dependence together with the non - fermi liquid behavior in the pseudogap regime have led to the hypothesis for a quantum critical point ( qcp ) near the optimal doping level@xcite as well as other models such as preformed cooper pairs,@xcite bose - einstein condensation at @xmath3,@xcite @xmath2-density wave phase with orbital currents in the pseudogap regime,@xcite and spin gap scenario .",
    "@xcite however , these models have been developed around experimental findings in the p - type cuprates . given that the cuprates can not be properly described by a simple one - band hubbard model and therefore lack apparent particle - hole symmetry , it is not obvious whether all phenomena in the p - type cuprates can be generalized to the n - type cuprates .    in this work ,",
    "we compare the quasiparticle tunneling spectra of a variety of p - type and n - type cuprate superconductors , with special emphasis on the doping dependence and the effects of quantum impurities in the cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "the physical implications of our investigation are discussed .",
    "the p - type cuprates studied in this work include the under- and optimally doped @xmath4 ( ybco ) , overdoped ybco with ca - substitution , an optimally doped ybco with 0.26% zn and 0.4% mg substitutions for cu in the cuo@xmath1 planes,@xcite and the under- and optimally doped @xmath5 ( lsco ) system.@xcite the spectra are taken using a low - temperature scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) , with the average quasiparticle momentum along different crystalline axes .",
    "the surface preparation with chemical etching method and surface characterizations are described elsewhere.@xcite      the pairing symmetry and momentum ( @xmath6)-dependent pairing potential @xmath7 can be derived self - consistently by applying the generalized btk analysis to the directional tunneling spectra taken on each sample.@xcite we find that the pairing symmetry of p - type cuprates is dependent on the doping level and the crystalline structure . for cuprates with orthorhombic structure such as the ybco system ,",
    "the pairing symmetry is predominantly @xmath2-wave in the underdoped regime and ( @xmath8)-wave with a significant @xmath9-wave component increasing with doping in the overdoped limit.@xcite on the other hand , for tetragonal samples such as the @xmath10 ( bscco ) and lsco , the pairing symmetry is consistent with pure @xmath2-wave for all doping levels .",
    "moreover , no discernible complex order parameter could be detected in the p - type cuprates based on our sts studies.@xcite therefore no obvious qcp with a universal broken symmetry can be identified in the p - type cuprates based on our tunneling studies .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2-component of the superconducting gap ( @xmath11 ) in the ybco system is only weakly dependent on the doping level for the optimal and underdoped samples,@xcite and is reduced significantly in the overdoped regime , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "these gap values do not persist above @xmath3,@xcite and are therefore consistent with the pairing potential .",
    "our findings are in contrast to the point - contact spectra of bscco that exhibit a rapidly increasing averaged energy gap with decreasing doping,@xcite and the large averaged gap of the underdoped bscco appears to merge with the pseudogap .",
    "however , recent tunneling experiments on bscco mesas suggest that the spectral pseudogap does not have the same physical origin as the superconducting gap.@xcite we also note that the @xmath12 ratio in ybco increases with decreasing doping level , suggesting increasing electronic correlation in the underdoped regime.@xcite    in general , the quasiparticle spectra of the ybco system exhibit long - range spatial homogeneity for most doping levels,@xcite in contrast to the nano - scale spectral variations found in some underdoped bscco.@xcite this difference may be attributed to the more homogeneous oxygen distribution in ybco , where oxygen vacancies exist in the cuo - chains and are often structurally ordered .",
    "in contrast , oxygen vacancies in bscco can exist in different atomic planes and are generally disordered , thereby giving rise to nano - scale inhomogeneity in underdoped bscco . from the perspective of competing orders , nano - scale phase separations can occur for limited doping levels . indeed , significantly more homogeneous tunneling gap values have been reported for tunneling directly into the cuo@xmath1 plane of a bscco sample,@xcite implying that nano - scale phase separations need not be a natural consequence of short superconducting coherence lengths .",
    "an important consequence of either @xmath2 or @xmath13 pairing symmetry is the existence of low - energy nodal quasiparticle excitations .",
    "these fermionic excitations can interact strongly with quantum impurities in the cuo@xmath1 plane and significantly influence the local quasiparticle spectra near impurities.@xcite furthermore , the existence of nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic cu@xmath0-cu@xmath0 correlation in the superconducting state can induce effective kondo - like magnetic moments on the neighboring cu@xmath0 ions of a spinless impurity ( such as zn@xmath0 , mg@xmath0 , al@xmath14 and li@xmath15 with @xmath16),@xcite as confirmed from nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr)@xcite and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins)@xcite experiments .",

    "where @xmath40 is the density of states at the fermi level and @xmath41 assumes isolated and equivalent magnetic impurities at all sites .",
    "in contrast , for _ induced _ magnetic moments on the neighboring cu@xmath0 sites due to a spinless impurity , the perturbation hamiltonian @xmath42 must include the four cu sites @xmath33 adjacent to the impurity with @xmath43 and also involve screening channels associated with @xmath9- , @xmath44- , @xmath45- and @xmath24-wave like conduction electrons on the four sites.@xcite the resulting quasiparticle spectra exhibit a single resonant peak at the impurity site and alternating intensities and signs of the peak energy away from the impurity.@xcite    we have performed sts studies on an optimally doped ybco with @xmath46 zn and @xmath47 mg substitution .",

    "significantly far away from any impurities , the tunneling spectra are similar to typical c - axis quasiparticle tunneling spectra in pure ybco , although the global superconducting gap @xmath11 is suppressed to @xmath49 ev from the value @xmath50 mev in pure ybco , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a).@xcite moreover , the energy @xmath51 associated with the `` dip - hump ''",
    "satellite features also shifts substantially relative to that in pure ybco .",
    "the dip - hump features have been attributed to quasiparticle damping by many - body excitations such as spin fluctuations or phonons,@xcite and the resonant energy of the many - body excitation can be empirically determined via @xmath52 .",
    "we find that @xmath53 decreases significantly to @xmath54 mev from the value @xmath55 mev in pure ybco .",
    "this drastic decrease suggests that phonons are unlikely the relevant many - body excitations that contribute to the satellite features .",
    "on the other hand , the local spectral evolution suggests that there are two types of impurities , one with a resonant scattering energy @xmath56 mev and the other with @xmath57 mev at the impurity site.@xcite the intensity of the resonant peak decreases rapidly within approximately one fermi wavelength along the cu - o bonding direction , as shown in the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "moreover , the resonant scattering peak appears to alternate between energies of the same magnitude and opposite signs as the stm tip is displaced away from an impurity , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "some of these spatially varying spectra near impurities even reveal slow temporal variations over long times ( about @xmath58 s ) .",
    "although more detailed studies and proper consideration of the tunneling matrix@xcite are needed to fully understand the relative contributions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the presence of temporal variations might be more consistent with the kondo effect .",
    "for comparison with other systems , however , we may assume pure potential scattering and use eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot ] ) to derive the corresponding phase shifts associated with the spinless quantum impurities .",
    "we obtain @xmath59 and @xmath60 in comparison with the phase shift ( @xmath61 ) due to zn in bscco@xcite , suggesting that the impurity scattering strength in ybco is weaker .",
    "despite strong consensus for the pairing symmetry in p - type cuprates as being predominantly @xmath2,@xcite the situation associated with the n - type cuprates remains controversial . in the case of one - layer n - type cuprates @xmath62 system ( ln = nd ,",
