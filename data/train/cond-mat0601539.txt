    "properties of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) of alkali atom gases attract a considerable current interest . recently quantized vortices and lattices of vortices",

    "these vortices were investigated in a large number of theoretical works for the case @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "however , superfluid phases in the @xmath0 bec were analyzed only for the case of the absence of magnetic field and rotation @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "ueda1,ueda2 ) .",
    "spinor @xmath0 bec has one more interaction parameter as compared to the @xmath1 bec because of the larger spin value .",
    "therefore , there are three possible phases in absence of magnetic field : polar , ferromagnetic and cyclic states .    due to the internal degree of freedom",
    ", a rich variety of exotic vortices have been proposed in @xmath1 spinor bec s by a large number of authors kasamatsu2005 .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 spinor bec s with the ferromagnetic spin interaction exhibit so(3 ) symmetry in spin space , which means that the local spins may sweep the whole or half the unit sphere .",
    "it has been found that this topological excitation , called the mermin - ho vortex , can be stabilized in the rotating system @xcite . in the case of @xmath0 spinor bec s ,",
    "the possibility of such the coreless vortex state has been predicted by zhang _",
    "however , in the possible kinds of atoms , such as @xmath4rb and @xmath2na , the estimated spin interactions are situated in the close vicinity of the phase boundary between polar and cyclic phases @xcite ; the detailed study on the rotating ground state with the cyclic spin interaction is an unexplored region .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study vortex structure in rotating spinor @xmath5 condensate having finite magnetization .",
    "the condensate wave function has five components .",
    "we solved the extended gross - pitaevskii equations both numerically and variationally using trial functions for each component of the wave function .",
    "there is a good agreement between the results of both methods .",
    "we restricted our consideration only to the case of axially - symmetric solutions .",
    "energies of polar , ferromagnetic and cyclic states with various sets of winding numbers for different components of the order parameter were evaluated .",

    "the energy of the system depends on three interaction parameters @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 which can be defined as @xcite@xmath15where ( @xmath16 ) @xmath17and @xmath18 is the scattering lengths characterizing collisions between atoms with the total spin @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",

    "only one component of the order parameter is nonzero : @xmath34 in cyclic phase , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an arbitrary phase ( energy of the system is degenerate with respect to @xmath39 ) . in polar phase , there are three possibilities : in the first case @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 in the second case @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 , and in the third case @xmath46  and all other components are equal to zero . here",

    "extended gross - pitaevskii equations can be obtained in a standard way from the condition of minimum of free energy of the system eq .",
    "( energy_def ) : @xmath55where a chemical potential @xmath56  is interpreted as the lagrange multiplier .",
    "we use the total number of particles @xmath57  and the magnetization @xmath27  as independent variables .",
    "five nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equations eq .",
    "( [ gp_eq ] ) are coupled and they can be solved numerically .",
    "however , some important consequences can be derived from the preliminary analysis of these equations . in this paper , we consider only axially - symmetric solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equations . in this case , each component of the order parameter @xmath58  can be represented as @xmath59where @xmath60 is a polar angle and @xmath61  is a winding number .",
    "axial symmetry of the solution implies that there are some constraints for the possible sets of @xmath62 it can be shown from eq .",
    "( [ gp_eq ] ) that @xmath61  obeys the following equations @xmath63eqs .",
    "( [ l_rule_1])-([l_rule_3 ] ) were obtained under the condition that all the five components of the order parameter are nonzero .",
    "if some of these components are equal to zero identically then other possibilities appear for the @xmath61  values .",
    "we list here all the possible phases different from ordinary vortex - free state : @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 here numbers denote values of @xmath79 , `` @xmath80 '' denotes zero value of the corresponding component of the order parameter .",
    "we restricted ourselves only to the cases , when the largest winding number does not exceed @xmath21 , vortices with higher winding numbers are assumed to be nonstable .",
    "now we can find the solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equations for each phase listed above .",
    "for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ gp_eq ] ) , we apply a numerical method , which was used before in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "besides the numerical solution , we also use a variational _ ansatz _ based on trial functions for each component of the order parameter .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ gp_eq ] ) that each component of the order parameter has an asymptotic @xmath81 at @xmath82  and that in the expansion of @xmath83  in powers of @xmath10 there are only terms proportional to @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is an integer number .",
    "superfluid density vanishes at infinite distances from the center of the potential well and @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , we have chosen the following trial function @xmath88 \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{r^{2}}{2r_{j}^{2}% } \\right ) ,   \\label{trial_function_def}\\]]where @xmath89 , @xmath90  and @xmath91 are variational parameters .",
    "parameters @xmath92 are not completely independent since they are related by one equation that is a condition of equality of number of atoms to the given number .    in the limit of noniteracting gas , gross - pitaevskii equation becomes linear with respect to the order parameter .",
    "in this case , it is easy to see that @xmath93  in the thomas - fermi regime this is no longer valid and the system tries to minimize its energy by changing parameters @xmath90  and @xmath91  as compared to the limit of an ideal gas .",
    "according to our estimates , for the case of one - component order parameter , trial function ( trial_function_def ) is able to give rather accurate results for the energy and for the rotation frequency of transition from the vortex - free to the vortex state even in the moderate thomas - fermi limit .",
    "therefore , in this paper we apply the method to the case of five - component order parameter .",
    "note that variational approaches were applied before for the analysis of vortex structures in mesoscopic superconductors within the ginzburg - landau theory , see e.g. @xcite , and for vortices in scalar and spinor bec @xcite .    using eq .",
    "( [ energy_def ] ) and the normalization condition for the order parameter one can find the energy of the system analytically as a function of variational parameters for each set of @xmath61 .",
    "however , final expression for the energy is rather cumbersome and we do not present it here .",
    "values of variational parameters can be calculated by a numerical minimization of the energy .",
    "we consider the situation , when the concentration of atoms in @xmath94-direction is equal to @xmath95 @xmath96 , and the scattering length @xmath97 equals @xmath98 @xmath99 .",
    "according to the estimates made in ref .",
    "ciobanu , @xmath2na , @xmath100rb , @xmath4rb , @xmath101rb correspond to points on the phase diagram in @xmath102 vs. @xmath103 plane ( in absence of magnetic field and rotation ) , which are situated in the close vicinity to the phase boundaries between ferromagnetic , polar and cyclic states ( see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "there are even some uncertainties in positions of these points on the phase diagram because of the error bars in @xmath104 .",
    "it was assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath2na , @xmath100rb , and @xmath101rb bec s are in polar , ferromagnetic , and cyclic states , respectively , and @xmath4rb corresponds to the phase boundary between the polar and cyclic states . in this paper , we perform all the calculations for the polar state at @xmath105 , @xmath106 . for the cyclic state we put @xmath105 , @xmath107 . and for the state situated on the phase boundary between cyclic and polar state , which we call cyclic+polar , we use @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "we calculated the dependences of the energy of the system on the magnetization for these three phases for different vortex states , when the system is rotated with the frequency @xmath110 .",
    "our results obtained by the numerical solution to the gross - pitaevskii equations are presented on fig .  1 for cyclic ( a ) , polar ( b ) , and cyclic+polar ( c ) states .",
    "in table 1 we show numerically and variationally calculated values of the magnetization , at which the transitions occur between different phases for the case of cyclic state ( fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) . in this table , `` a '' denotes the transition between @xmath111  and @xmath112  states , `` b '' between @xmath113  and @xmath114  states , and `` c '' between @xmath114  and @xmath115  states .",

    "1(a ) ) , which were calculated numerically and variationally . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for lower magnetization , condensate has to be distributed between the states with @xmath116 .",
    "it turns out that again in all phase diagrams in fig .",
    "1 the ground state is represented by the phase @xmath114 in rather broad range of @xmath27 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in this case , it is favorable to put most of the particles in the state with winding number @xmath19 in order to occupy the inner part of the trap .",
    "most of remaining particles are condensed to the state with winding number @xmath20 occupying the outer part of the trap and thus decreasing the energy of interaction ( in `` density '' channel ) of particles with @xmath117  and @xmath20 .",
    "typical profiles of the particles densities in different hyperfine states for this vortex phase are shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) for the cyclic state at @xmath118 .",
    "2(d ) indicates @xmath10-dependences of the order parameters @xmath119  and @xmath120 , which physically are similar to that in the case of @xmath115 state shown in fig .",

    "we can conclude that at high magnetizations , @xmath122 , the state with lowest energy is mostly determined by interactions in the `` density '' channel , whereas at low magnetization @xmath123 , spin interactions play an important role . in fig .",
    "2(e ) and ( f ) we present the @xmath10-dependences of the superfluid density in different hyperfine states and order parameters @xmath119  and @xmath124 for the cyclic+polar @xmath125 state at @xmath126 , where this phase has the lowest energy . in this case",
    ", particles are distributed between states @xmath127 and @xmath128 . the state with @xmath129",
    "has a winding number @xmath19 , and these particles occupy a space with minimal trapping potential .",
    "all other particles are condensed in the state with winding number @xmath20 thus decreasing the interaction energy in the `` density '' channel . as a result",
    ", the order parameter @xmath119 is nonzero everywhere except of the point @xmath130 , since at any @xmath131 there are particles in the states with @xmath132 , and the formation of singlet pairs is possible .",
    "the order parameter @xmath124  is nonzero at @xmath130 and @xmath87 , since in both cases there are particles condensed in the states with nonzero @xmath133 . at the same time , at small values of @xmath10 most of particles are condensed in the state with @xmath127 and at larger @xmath10 in the state with @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , there is an abrupt change in the spin direction at intermediate values of r. this results in the vanishing of @xmath135 near the vortex core .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the spin texture , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , for the phases @xmath125  and @xmath138  in cyclic state . in the first case , in the vortex - core region , the spins are polarized along the z - direction . in the outer region",
    "the spin vanishes and @xmath119 grows , where the spin amplitude has a node and the pure polar state forms . in the second case , in the outer region , the spins are polarized along the z - direction . in the core - region ,",
    "the spins lean toward the origin .",
    "at the origin , the spin vanishes and the pure polar state forms ( @xmath139 ) , because the spin texture exhibits the @xmath20-dimensional radial disgyration in the core region .",
