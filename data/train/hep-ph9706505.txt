    "in ref .  @xcite it was demonstrated that based on the hadron - parton duality one can discribe rather well the diffractive @xmath0-meson electroproduction on the unpolarized target in the framework of perturbative qcd , not only for the longitudinal part of the cros section but also for the transverse one . at large energies ( i.e. in the small @xmath1 region )",
    "the amplitude of this process is proportional to the gluon density and the cross section is proportional to the gluon density squared .",
    "correspondingly , on the polarized nucleon the spin dependet part of the amplitude should be given in terms of the polarized parton densities @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in the present paper , the same hadron - parton duality hypothesis will be used to calculate the spin dependent part of the amplitude of diffractive @xmath0 leptoproduction within the leading log approximation ( lla ) of perturbative qcd .",
    "was done in @xcite assuming a nonrelativistic @xmath7 meson wave function . ]",
    "first we recall the hadron - parton duality hypothesis .",
    "let us consider the amplitude of the open @xmath8 leptoproduction , project it on the state with the spin @xmath9 ( isospin @xmath10 ) and average over a mass interval @xmath11 ( typically @xmath12 gev@xmath13 ) in the region of @xmath0 mass . in this domain",
    "the more complicated partonic states ( @xmath14 ) are suppressed , while on the hadronic side the @xmath15 states are known to dominate .",
    "thus for low @xmath16 we mainly have @xmath17 or in other words @xmath18 where the limits @xmath19 and @xmath20 are chosen so that they appropriately embrace the @xmath0-meson mass region and @xmath21 means the projection of the @xmath8 system onto the @xmath9 , @xmath10 state .",
    "the procedure of the projection onto the @xmath9 state is described in sect .",
    "then in sect.3 we calculate the spin dependent born amplitude for @xmath22 process in the small @xmath23 region ; here @xmath24 is the heavy photon virtuality and @xmath25 is the photon proton energy squared .",
    "taking into account the leading log@xmath26 corrections within the lla in sect.4 we express the result in terms of the parton distributions @xmath5 and @xmath6 and compare it with the formulae for the unpolarized case .",
    "this way the spin - spin asymmetry for the diffractive open quark production is calculated . finally in sect .",
    "5 we discuss the asymmetry for @xmath0-meson production .",
    "the cross section of diffractive open quark leptoproduction @xmath27 where : @xmath28 is the electric charge of the quark ( say , @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 is the number of colours while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the transverse momentum and photon momentum fraction carried by the quark ; @xmath33 is the quark mass , @xmath34 is the quark helicity and @xmath35 is the amplitude of the process .    to decompose the cross section onto the definite ( @xmath8 ) spin ( @xmath36 )",
    "state one can integrate over @xmath37 and write @xmath38 with the coefficients @xmath39 given by the projection of the amplitude with the help of the conventional spin rotation matrices @xmath40 @xmath41 the factor @xmath42 comes from the denominator in the @xmath43-function after the @xmath44 integration of ( 2 ) while the @xmath45 reflects the normalization of the spin rotation matrices @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the projection of the spin @xmath49 onto the initial photon or quark axis respectively ; the value of @xmath47 is given by the helicity of heavy photon , while for the quark helicity @xmath50 the value of @xmath51 due to helicity conservation of the @xmath52-vertex ; @xmath53 is the quark polar angle which may be expressed in terms of @xmath32 as @xmath54 .",
    "the projection onto the isospin @xmath10 state gives just the factor @xmath55 in accordence with the well known @xmath56 ratio in vector dominance model .",
    "let us consider for the begining interaction with the quark target .",
    "the born amplitude of the diffractive reaction @xmath57 is described by the sum of the diagrams shown in fig.1 .    at large energies",
    "@xmath58 the main contribution comes from the longitudinal polarizations of t - channel gluons ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 in fig.1 ) , i.e. the spin part of gluon propagator is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the target ( quark or nucleon ) mass , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the 4-momenta of the target ( initial quark or proton ) , recoil quark ( or proton ) and photon correspondingly and we assume that the momentum transfered @xmath67 is small .",
    "indeed , in the forward direction the transverse component @xmath68 and the longitudinal part gives @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "however the longitudinal t - channel ( coulomb - like ) gluon looses the information about the polarization of the target . thus at least one gluon must have transverse polarization .",
    "indeed for the longitudinally polarized target with spin vector @xmath71 the spin dependent part of the trace in the bottom of the diagram fig.1 ( the target loop ) looks like @xmath72\\ ; = \\ ;   -2i\\epsilon^{\\sigma\\sigma'\\alpha\\beta}l_\\alpha p_\\beta\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the antisymmetric tensor and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) corresponds to the polarization of the left ( right ) t - channel gluon in fig.1 .",
    "( considering the forward amplitude we put the momentum transfer @xmath76 . ) + as @xmath77 is the longitudinal vector while the @xmath78 , two other indices @xmath79 should be the transverse ( say , @xmath80 ) and the longitudinal @xmath81 ones .",
    "so the spin dependent contribution of the lower part of the graph takes the form @xmath82 here the gluon polarization vector @xmath83 ( see eq.(5 ) ) ; @xmath84 is the two - dimensional antisymmetric tensor acting in the transverse plane .",
    "the denominator @xmath85 comes from the two gluon ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) propagators ( recall that in the forward direction @xmath86 ) .    to find the contribution corresponding to the upper quark loop we use the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite and calculate first the matrix element of the @xmath52 transition putting both the quarks ( with helicities @xmath34 and @xmath87 ) on mass shell .    for the transversely polarized photon the matrix element reads @xmath88,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the photon polarization vector ;",
    "the first factor @xmath90 reflects the normalization ( @xmath91 ) of the quark fields .",
    "the quark - gluon vertex conserves the helicity of the high energy quark and the momentum fraction @xmath32 is not changed either .",
    "therefore only the transverse momentum of the quark @xmath31 in eq.(7 ) may be different from the final quark momentum @xmath92 . in order to simplify the projection onto the @xmath93 state we use the momentum @xmath94 in the rest frame of the @xmath8-system",
    "( the @xmath32 axis is directed along the target proton momentum ) and put the light quark mass @xmath95 .",
    "so the value of @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 is the mass of the @xmath8 pair and @xmath53 is the quark polar angle ) .",
    "for the case of the longitudinal polarizations ( @xmath98 ) of both t - channel gluons the quark - gluon vertex @xmath99 looks as the emission of a soft ( @xmath100 ) gluon by a classical colour charge ( i.e. by the current @xmath101 ) giving the factor @xmath102 for each vertex .",
    "this factor @xmath103 cancels the normalization factors ( @xmath104 ) of the quark fields .",
    "so the contribution of the upper part of feynman diagram shown in fig.1a takes the form  @xcite @xmath105\\;.\\ ] ] the new factor @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) comes from the energy denominator @xmath108 and corresponds to the propagator of quark @xmath109 .",
    "however in our case one of the t - channel gluons has the transverse polarization @xmath110 ( see eq.(2 ) ) . when this gluon couples to the quark line it gives the factor @xmath111 instead of the old one @xmath112 for a longitudinal gluon polarization vector @xmath113 .",
    "note that , as it was confirmed by the explicite calculation of the trace , within the lla the quark - gluon vertex may be written as the emission of a soft ( @xmath100 ) gluon by a classical colour charge ( i.e. by the current @xmath114 ) for the polarized case also .",
    "thus for the spin dependent part of the amplitute fig.1a in comparison with eq.(8 ) one looses the factor @xmath115 but gets the @xmath116 ; an extra factor of two reflects the contributions of two terms in the expression ( 6 ) ( due to the permutation of gluon polarizations ) .    to select the leading logarithm in the @xmath117 integral ( coming from the region of @xmath118 )",
    ", we have to separate in the numerator the term proportional to @xmath119 .",
    "there is no such term in the fig.1a contribution , but in the case of fig.1b , where @xmath120 , one can take the product @xmath121 and put @xmath122 in the denominator .",
    "term coming from the expansion of the denominator @xmath123 does not contribute as , after the averaging over the @xmath124 direction ( in the azimuthal plane ) , the product @xmath125 gives zero .",
    "indeed , the intergral over the azimuthal angle @xmath126 reads @xmath127 . ]",
    "so the amplitude corresponding to the fig.1b takes the form @xmath128}{\\bar{q}^2+k^2_t}\\frac{2(e^\\pm\\cdot l_t)(e^\\perp\\cdot k_t)}{zs}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 is the colour coefficient .    adding the contribution of another graph where the left t - channel gluon couples to the antiquark with @xmath130 ( instead of @xmath131 for the quark ) and neglecting the @xmath132 in our small ( @xmath133 ) mass region one finally gets @xmath134 here we average over the dirrection of vector @xmath135 in azimuthal plane and the equalities @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( with @xmath138 ) is used .      note that for the unpolarized case the amplitude given by the gluon exchange was proportional to the gluon density @xmath139 and in the born approximation it tends to @xmath140 at @xmath141 .",
    "the quark exchange corresponds ( in the same born approximation ) to the quark structure function which was negligible ( @xmath142 ) at small @xmath141 .",
    "in contrast , the spin dependent part of the amlitude ( 10 ) is proportional to @xmath1 , reflecting the fact that the polarized gluon distribution @xmath143 ( modular the @xmath144 corrections ) in the small @xmath1 region .",
    "the quark distribution @xmath145 possesses the same property . indeed , in the polarized dglap evolution the splitting kernels @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 have no @xmath149 singularity ( such a singular term in @xmath150 provides the @xmath151 behaviour of the unpolarized gluons @xmath152 ) .",
    "therefore now we can not omit the quark exchange amplitude .",
    "in other words after the @xmath52 transition one has consider not only the quark - quark scattering ( shown in fig.1 ) but the antiquark - quark annihilation ( see fig.2 ) as well .",
    "thanks to the helicity conservation , in the forward direction ( @xmath68 ) the amplitude shown in fig.2 conserves the helicity of initial quark line @xcite ; it contains the factor @xmath153 , where : @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the helicities of the initial and final antiquark whilst @xmath156 denotes the helicity of target quark .",
    "+ the momentum fraction @xmath32 of the fast antiquark is also not changed . from this point of view both the gluon and the quark exchange act in the same way .",
    "the only difference is the precise form of the quark - quark amplitude .    in the small @xmath1 region ,",
    "the leading logarithmic contribution of the quark - antiquark annihilation amplitude is well known @xcite . @xmath157 ( with @xmath158 ) .",
    "thus the contribution of the feynman diagram shown in fig.2 ( fast antiquark with the momentum fraction @xmath130 and @xmath159 annihilates with the target quark ) reads : @xmath160    with the help of the relation @xmath161 it may be written as @xmath162",
    "in order to make the ( born ) calculation more realistic we have to include the ladder evolution gluons ( shown symbolically by the dashed lines in fig.1,2 ) and to consider the process at the proton , rather than the quark , level ; i.e. the heavy photon diffractive dissociation on the proton target .",
    "this is achieved by the replacements : @xmath163 for the gluon exgange amplitude and @xmath164 for the antiquark - target quark annihilation .    indeed , the logarithmic @xmath165 integration in eq .",
    "( 10 ) is nothing else but the first step of the dglap evolution of the spin dependent gluon distribution @xmath166 with the splitting function @xcite @xmath167 for @xmath168 .",
    "correspondingly , in the quark case of eq .",
    "( 13 ) this is the first step of the dglap evolution of the spin dependent quark distribution @xmath169 with the splitting function @xcite @xmath170 for @xmath168 .    strictly speaking , even at zero transverse momentum @xmath68 one",
    "does not obtain the exact gluon structure function , as a non - zero component of the longitudinal momentum is transferred through the two - gluon ( two - quark ) ladder .",
    "however , in the region of interest , @xmath70 , the value of @xmath171 is so small that we may safely put @xmath172 and identify the ladder coupling to the proton with @xmath173 ( or with @xmath174 in the quark case ) ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "the arguments of the parton structure function should be @xmath175 and @xmath176 .    now in the leading log@xmath177 approach the spin dependent parts of the amplitudes ( 10,13 ) read @xmath178 @xmath179 and @xmath180 for the antiquark component of the target wave function .",
    "+ in the last two equations ( 17,18 ) the helicity of fast quark ( antiquark ) is strongly correlated with the target helicity ( @xmath181 see eqs .",
    "( 12,13 ) ) and the polarized quark distribution @xmath182 . on the other hand in eq .",
    "( 16 ) there is no such a correlation and calculating the cross section with fixed helicities of the initial photon and proton one has to sum two contributions ( with @xmath183 and @xmath183 ) .      in the same notation",
    "the forward amplitude for the unpolarized case ( and a transversely polarized photon ) looks like : @xmath184 in other words the whole amplitude is proportional to @xmath185 @xmath186 note that @xmath187 .",
    "therefore the @xmath173 term changes the sign when one reverses the helicity of incoming photon .. instead of @xmath188 ( see eq . ( 5 ) ) ] for the quark case the amplidudes ( 17,18 ) change the sign either due to the sign of @xmath189 or due to the second ( @xmath190 ) term in the numerator corresponding to the photon helicity",
    ".    in terms of the spin - spin asymmetry @xmath191 , eq.(20 ) means that for the heavy photon `` elastic '' diffractive dissociation @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the lepton momentum fraction carried by the photon in the target proton rest frame . ]",
    "@xmath194 the arrows indicate the helicities of the incoming photon and the target nucleon and for the moment we omit the quark contribution in eq .",
    "( 21 ) .    as in the case of @xmath7 leptoproduction an extra factor 2 in eq .",
    "( 21 ) comes in because the cross section of the diffractive process is proportional to the parton ( gluon ) density squared .",
    "note , however , that due to the fermi motion which washes out the effect , the effective analysing power of the @xmath0-meson production turns out to be 4 times smaller in comparison with the nonrelativistic @xmath7-meson ( see @xcite ) .    the whole expression in the limit of @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( which is reasonable at small @xmath1 ) takes the form @xmath197",
    "\\left((1-z)\\delta \\bar{q}(x,\\bar{q}^2)-z\\delta q(x,\\bar{q}^2)\\right ) } { 3[z^2+(1-z)^2]g(x,\\bar{q}^2)}\\ ] ]    it is anticipated that the main part of the corrections ( nlo contributions ) are cancelled when calculating the asymmetry by eqs .",
    "( 21,22 ) .",
    "for example , the uncertainty coming from the value of the qcd coupling constant ( more exactly from the scale at which @xmath144 is evaluated ) do cancel in the ratio eq.(22 ) .",
    "thus the accuracy of the expressions ( 21,22 ) for the asymmetry is expected to be even better than that of the unpolarized diffractive amplitude .",
    "in order to obtain the spin - spin asymmetry for the case of diffractive @xmath0-meson production we have to project the amplitudes ( 16 - 18 ) onto the spin @xmath93 state as it was discribed in sect.2 ( see eq . ( 4 ) ) .    of course at the begining the photon produces the @xmath8 pair in a pure @xmath93 state with the @xmath53 distribution @xmath198 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath53 distribution is given by the factor @xmath199 $ ] in the matrix element ( 7 ) and for , say , photon helicity + 1 ( @xmath200 ) and @xmath183 it is equal to @xmath201 .",
    "however , interaction with the target distorts the @xmath8 state due to the @xmath26 dependence of the structure functions and an extra factor @xmath202 in the denominators of eqs .",
    "( 16 - 18 ) .    strictly speaking the integral over @xmath203 ( 4 ) should be done numerically with the concrete parton distributions ( in the amplitudes @xmath35 ) . instead of this",
    "let us discuss the singularities and the main structure of the integral ( 4 ) .    in the scaling limit",
    "( parton densities have no @xmath26 dependence ) the singularities at @xmath204 ( i.e. @xmath205 or @xmath206 ) comes from the @xmath207 factor in the denominators @xmath208 of eq.s ( 16 - 18 ) .",
    "note that at fixed mass @xmath209 the value of transverse momentum @xmath210 and after the @xmath93 projection the integral ( 4 ) has only the logarithmic singularity ( in the small @xmath107 region ) which is usual for conventional deep inelastic process .",
    "if , for simplicity , we assume that in the whole essential region of @xmath212 the small @xmath1 parton distribution may be parametrized as @xmath214 with the fixed value of @xmath215 , it is easy to calculate the coefficients @xmath39 using the identity @xmath216 or for the case of small @xmath217 just to put @xmath218 note that due to the factors @xmath32 or @xmath219 in the quark exchange amplitudes ( 17,18 ) , we have only one singular point : @xmath206 at @xmath220 for the case of fast antiquark - quark annihilation ( 17 ) and @xmath206 at @xmath221 for the case of eq .",
    "it leads to a numerical suppression of the quark exchange contribution in comparison with the gluon exchange one where for any @xmath50 one has the singularity at both points @xmath206 and @xmath205 .",
