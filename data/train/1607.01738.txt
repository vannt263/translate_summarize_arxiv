    "a grand challenge problem at the forefront of space physics and astrophysics is to understand how the energy of turbulent plasma flows and electromagnetic fields is converted into energy of the plasma particles , either as heat or some other form of particle energization . under the typically low - density and high - temperature conditions of turbulent plasmas in the heliosphere , such as the solar wind ,",
    "the turbulent dynamics is weakly collisional , requiring the application of six - dimensional ( 3d-3v ) kinetic plasma theory to follow the evolution of the turbulence , where the damping of the turbulent fluctuations occurs due to collisionless interactions between the electromagnetic fields and the individual plasma particles .",
    "although _ in situ _ spacecraft measurements in the solar wind provide detailed information about the electromagnetic and plasma fluctuations , these measurements are typically limited to one point ( or , at most , a few points ) in space . of great benefit to plasma turbulence research",
    "would be a scheme to use single - point measurements of the electromagnetic fields and particle velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) to diagnose the collisionless damping of the turbulent fluctuations and to characterize how the damped turbulent energy is distributed to particles with different velocities .",
    "here we present an innovative technique to identify and characterize the collisionless mechanisms that govern the net transfer of energy from the electromagnetic fields to the plasma particles by correlating measurements of the electromagnetic fields and particle vdfs at a single point in space .",
    "these _ field - particle correlations _ yield a local estimate of the rate of particle heating , and further provide a characteristic _ velocity - space signature _ of the collisionless damping mechanism that leads to the energization of the plasma particles .",
    "early attempts to explore wave - particle interactions using spacecraft measurements sought the spatial or temporal coincidence of wave fields with enhanced particle fluxes @xcite .",
    "later , wave - particle correlators were flown on rockets and spacecraft to identify the phase - bunching of electrons by correlating the counts of electrons in a single energy and angle bin with the phase of the dominant wave @xcite .",
    "motivated by modern particle instrumentation with improved temporal and phase - space resolution , the field - particle correlation technique described here takes a significant leap forward by recovering the correlation as a function of particle velocity , generating a much more detailed velocity - space signature of the collisionless interactions .",
    "although the novel field - particle correlation technique devised here is intended for use in diagnosing the damping of turbulent fluctuations in the weakly collisional solar wind , to illustrate the concept in a simplified framework , we present here its application to the 1d-1v vlasov - poisson system to explore the collisionless damping of electrostatic fluctuations in an unmagnetized plasma .",
    "after this demonstration of the fundamental concept of using field - particle correlations to investigate collisionless damping of fluctuations , we discuss the application of this technique to spacecraft observations of solar wind turbulence .",
    "the dynamics of electrostatic fluctuations in a collisionless plasma is governed by the vlasov - poisson equations , where the vlasov equation determines the collisionless evolution of the distribution function for each species @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the poisson equation determines the self - consistent evolution of the electric field , @xmath2 , dictated by the fluctuating charge density in the plasma .    to diagnose the collisionless transfer of energy between fields and particles , we define the _ phase - space energy density _ for a particle species @xmath0 as @xmath3 , the energy density per unit length per unit velocity . integrating @xmath4 over velocity yields the standard",
    "_ spatial energy density _ , and integrating over volume produces the total microscopic kinetic energy of the species , @xmath5 . splitting @xmath6 into equilibrium and perturbed components ,",
    "@xmath7where the magnitude of @xmath8 is limited only by the physical constraint @xmath9we can use the vlasov equation to obtain an equation for the rate of change of @xmath4 , @xmath10 the rate of change of @xmath4 is governed by three terms : from left to right , the ( linear ) ballistic term , the linear wave - particle interaction term , and the nonlinear wave - particle interaction term . when integrated over space using either periodic or infinitely distant boundary conditions , the ballistic and linear wave - particle interaction terms yield zero net energy transfer .",
    "only the nonlinear wave - particle interaction term produces a net change in particle energy .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath11 governs the net rate of energy transfer between the electromagnetic fields and plasma particles that is associated with collisionless damping @xcite .    taking the average of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwxvdt ] ) over the entire spatial domain  the approach taken in quasilinear theory  provides a rigorous approach to determine the net transfer of energy between the fields and particles , but the spatial information necessary to perform this average is not observationally accessible using single - point measurements . at a single point @xmath12 , all three terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwxvdt ] ) are nonzero .",
    "these terms describe both the _ oscillatory energy transfer _ associated with wave motion and the _ secular energy transfer _ associated with a net transfer of energy between fields and particles . unless the collisionless damping rate is particularly strong ,",
    "the magnitude of the oscillatory energy transfer described by these terms is generally much larger than that of the secular energy transfer , so the key challenge is to devise a procedure to isolate the small - amplitude rate of secular energy transfer governed by the nonlinear wave - particle interaction term .",
    "note that this local approach is valuable even in numerical simulations where full spatial information is accessible , because there is significant evidence that energy dissipation is often highly localized in space @xcite , so spatial averaging may obscure the details of the local dissipation mechanism , making it more difficult to identify the physical mechanism responsible .",
    "the form of the nonlinear wave - particle interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwxvdt ] ) suggests that the rate of change of phase - space energy density can be estimated by correlating single - point measurements of the electric field and particle vdfs .",
    "below we specify the procedure to isolate the local secular transfer of energy associated with the collisionless damping of electrostatic fluctuations in a 1d-1v vlasov - poisson plasma .",
    "labeling discrete measurement times as @xmath13 for @xmath14 , we define the single - point measurements at position @xmath12 and time @xmath15 of the field as @xmath16 and the perturbed distribution function as @xmath17 . for a correlation interval of @xmath18 , we define the field - particle correlation at time @xmath19 at position @xmath12 by @xmath20 note that this correlation is not normalized since the product directly corresponds to the rate of energy transfer , so the amplitude variation of this product as a function of velocity yields valuable information about the nature of the collisionless field - particle interaction .    for single - point measurements , the general idea of diagnosing the energy transfer at each point in phase space",
    "reduces to determining the distribution of the energy transfer rate in velocity space , producing a velocity - space signature characteristic of the physical mechanism .",
    "different collisionless mechanisms are likely to have distinct velocity - space signatures of the energy transfer .",
    "we illustrate this field - particle correlation analysis method for the case of the landau damping of langmuir waves in a 1d-1v vlasov - poisson plasma , but _ the concept of using field - particle correlations to diagnose collisionless energy transfer is extremely general_. in principle , this method can use single - point spacecraft measurements to examine the energization of particles in any weakly collisional heliospheric plasma .",
    "using the nonlinear vlasov - poisson simulation code ` vp ` @xcite , we apply field - particle correlations to examine collisionless damping in three cases : ( i ) a moderately damped standing langmuir wave pattern with @xmath21 ; ( ii ) a weakly damped standing langmuir wave pattern with @xmath22 ; and ( iii ) a moderately damped single propagating langmuir wave mode with @xmath21 , where @xmath23 is the electron debye length . for cases",
    "i & ii , @xmath24 is a sine wave with wavelength @xmath25 ; for case iii , @xmath24 satisfies the langmuir wave linear dispersion relation .",
    "the ` vp ` code evolves the nonlinear vlasov - poisson system of equations for ion and electron species using second - order centered finite differencing for spatial and velocity derivatives and a third - order adams - bashforth scheme in time .",
    "spatial boundary conditions are periodic and a green s function solution is used to determine @xmath26 .",
    "all cases have plasma parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 and numerical resolution @xmath29 and @xmath30 with a simulation domain of length @xmath31 .",
    "the cases with @xmath32 have a resonant velocity of @xmath33 and a linear damping rate of @xmath34 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] , we plot the instantaneous rate of change of @xmath35 due to the nonlinear wave - particle interaction term , @xmath36 , at @xmath37 for the three cases ( a)(c ) . without calculating the correlation @xmath38 over an appropriate time interval @xmath39",
    ", the largest rates of energy transfer do not necessarily correspond to the resonant velocities , @xmath40 ( dot - dashed black lines ) .",
    "the reason is that the larger amplitude oscillating energy transfer of the langmuir waves masks the smaller amplitude secular energy transfer of the collisionless damping .",
    "also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] is the time evolution of the electrostatic field energy @xmath41 ( long - dashed gray ) and the perturbed electron energy @xmath42 ( dashed red ) , showing that @xmath43 because the landau damping of langmuir waves transfers little of the electrostatic field energy to the ions for @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we focus here strictly on energy transferred to electrons .",
    "we also plot the nonlinear wave - particle interaction term integrated over all phase - space and time , @xmath44 ( dotted blue ) , demonstrating that this term alone contains all of the net energy transfer to the electrons .",
    "finally , at the single - point @xmath37 , we plot the time - integrated transfer rate , @xmath45 ( solid black ) , showing that we obtain a significant net transfer of energy from the field to the electrons for both moderately damped cases with @xmath21 .    to isolate the small - amplitude secular energy transfer in the presence of a much larger amplitude oscillating energy transfer , we must select an appropriate correlation interval @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] , we plot the correlation @xmath46 from eq .",
    "[ eq : cfp_sum ] for a range of correlation intervals @xmath47 ( colorbar ) for case i both for ( a ) an off - resonance velocity @xmath48 and ( b ) an on - resonance velocity @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 curve ( dark blue ) corresponds to a vertical slice along fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](a ) at the selected velocity @xmath51 . as the correlation interval @xmath39 increases , the large amplitude signal of the oscillating energy transfer is increasingly averaged out . for this case , the normalized wave period is @xmath52 , and we find that for correlation intervals @xmath53 , the large - amplitude oscillating energy transfer rate is significantly reduced , revealing the smaller amplitude secular energy transfer rate beneath . integrating the correlation in time , @xmath54 ,",
    "we find ( c ) little net energy at the non - resonant velocity , and ( d ) significant particle energization at the resonant velocity @xmath49 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullcorr ] , we plot the key results of this letter , the field - particle correlations @xmath38 for @xmath55 as a function of velocity and time for cases i  iii , ( a)(c ) . with a suitably long correlation interval @xmath53 ,",
    "the large amplitude signal of the oscillating energy transfer , dominating fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] , is diminished , revealing the secular transfer of energy .",
    "this velocity - space signature of the secular energy transfer rate is concentrated around the resonant velocity for the moderately damped cases , indicating a resonant process .",
    "integrating @xmath38 over velocity yields the net energy transfer rate at that point in space ( offset panels ) , equal to @xmath56 .",
    "this velocity integration demonstrates a net transfer of energy to the particles , but loses all velocity - space information that can be used to identify the nature of the collisionless energy transfer mechanism .",
    "the weakly damped case has a relatively insignificant energy transfer rate . in panels ( d)(f ) , we plot the accumulated change in the electron phase - space energy density , @xmath57 , showing a loss of energy at @xmath58 and gain of energy at @xmath59 for the moderately damped cases .",
    "this velocity - space signature corresponds physically to a flattening of the distribution function at the resonant velocity , consistent with the evolution of the spatially averaged electron vdf predicted by quasilinear theory @xcite .",
    "the nearly - monotonic increase of @xmath60 for the moderately damped cases shows that @xmath38 serves as a measure of collisionless damping rate and not merely the presence of monochromatic waves .",
    "proposed collisionless damping mechanisms in the solar wind fall into three classes : ( i ) coherent collisionless wave - particle interactions , such as landau damping , transit - time damping , or cyclotron damping @xcite ( ii ) incoherent collisionless wave - particle interactions , primarily leading to stochastic ion heating @xcite ; and ( iii ) dissipation in coherent structures , specifically current sheets , generally involving collisionless magnetic reconnection @xcite . under weakly collisional conditions ,",
    "all of these mechanisms are mediated by interactions between the electromagnetic fields and the individual plasma particles , and therefore all will lead to a correlation between the fields and particle vdfs .",
    "each mechanism is likely to generate a distinct velocity - space signature that can be diagnosed using the general approach of field - particle correlations .    for the case of the damping of solar wind turbulence , the appropriate form of the correlation will depend on the specific mechanism .",
    "for example , ion transit - time damping @xcite  the magnetic analogue of landau damping  will involve a correlation of the parallel perturbed magnetic field @xmath61 and the ion parallel vdf @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , the appropriate component of the field may be difficult to measure in space , such as the parallel component of the electric field , @xmath63 , that leads to landau damping . in this case , since the electromagnetic components are related by maxwell s equations , another field component may be used as a proxy ( since , at least in some instances , the fields have been shown to satisfy linear eigenfunction relationships @xcite ) .",
    "although the proxy correlation no longer corresponds directly to the transfer rate of phase - space energy density , it may nonetheless indicate the order of magnitude of the net energy transfer and its velocity - space signature may reveal the resonant nature of the interaction .",
    "the super - alfvnic flow of the solar wind is often exploited to interpret the temporal fluctuations measured by the spacecraft as the result of spatial fluctuations being swept past the spacecraft by the solar wind flow , an approximation known as the taylor hypothesis @xcite . how does this solar wind flow impact the field - particle correlation technique ?",
    "the key step is to perform the correlation over a suitably long correlation interval @xmath39 in order to average out the generally larger - amplitude oscillating energy transfer .",
    "fundamentally , to average out the oscillatory component , all that is necessary is that the measurements span more than @xmath64 of the wave phase @xmath65 , a function of time and position , @xmath66 .",
    "if the point of measurement is moving in space , @xmath67 , then the method simply requires that the phase @xmath68 span more than @xmath64 over the correlation interval @xmath39 , so the technique is essentially insensitive to the solar wind flow .",
    "the confirmation of this assertion in a fully turbulent system is the focus of ongoing work .",
    "the broadband nature of turbulent fluctuations could potentially smear out the velocity - space signature associated with damping at a particular wavelength .",
    "preliminary studies @xcite indicate that the narrow range of length scales over which certain damping mechanisms operate may alleviate this potential problem .",
    "finally , it may be impractical to compute the velocity derivative of the perturbed distribution function due to the noise and limited resolution of spacecraft measurements , so we may use an alternative correlation @xmath69 note that this correlation is related to @xmath38 by an integration by parts in velocity , so the velocity - integrated energy transfer rate is identical to that of @xmath38 ( see offset panels in fig .

    "i are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2 ] , yielding a velocity - space signature that indeed indicates a resonant process .",
    "here we present a novel field - particle correlation technique that requires only single - point measurements of the electromagnetic fields and particle vdfs to return an estimate of the net rate of energy transfer between fields and particles .",
    "furthermore , this innovative method yields valuable information about the distribution of this energy transfer in velocity space , providing a vital new means to identify the dominant collisionless mechanisms governing the damping of the turbulent fluctuations beyond that provided by measurements of velocity - integrated quantities such as @xmath72 .",
    "this field - particle correlation technique fully exploits the vast treasure of information contained in the _ fluctuations _ of the particle vdfs , potentially enabling new discoveries using single - point spacecraft measurements .",
