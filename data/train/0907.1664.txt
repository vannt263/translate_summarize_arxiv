    "the @xmath3 thick stratum corneum ( sc ) , the outermost layer of the skin @xcite , comprises rigid keratin filled pancake shaped non - viable cells ( corneocytes ) in an extra - cellular lipid matrix .",
    "this sc lipid matrix is believed to be the main barrier against water loss , with permeability values three to five orders of magnitude smaller compared to phospholipid bilayers forming plasma membranes @xcite .",
    "this high permeation barrier is vital for life to maintain the required ionic concentration inside the body for proper biochemical reactions . at the same time , controlled modulation of the barrier properties has the potential for non - invasive drug delivery @xcite and restoration of the barrier function in compromised skin @xcite .",
    "the sc lipid matrix is conspicuous in having a large fraction of lipids from the ceramide ( cer ) family with long and asymmetric acyl tails .",
    "the other major components of the lipid matrix are cholesterol ( chol ) and free fatty acid ( ffa ) @xcite .",
    "the bricks and mortar model @xcite , one of the widely accepted models for the sc arrangement , pictures corneocytes as essentially impermeable bricks joined by the thin lipid matrix forming the mortar phase .",
    "one of the explanations put forward for the extremely low permeability of the sc is that the permeating molecules traverse a tortuous route through the lipid matrix . in this picture",
    ", the special chemical structure of the lipids plays no important role for the passive permeation .",
    "an apparent experimental justification for this picture is a very large lag time between introducing a radioactive molecule at one side of the sc and detecting it on the other side . with a simple diffusion model , even for water",
    ", one needs to invoke a path length two orders of magnitude larger than the physical thickness of the sc layer considered @xcite .",
    "this picture assumes that water does not penetrate the corneocytes .",
    "however , the corneocytes contain small hygroscopic molecules such as amino acids @xcite ( collectively referred to as _ natural moisturizing factor _ or nmf @xcite ) . for fully hydrated sc",
    ", water diffusivity in the corneocyte is estimated to be within a factor 2 - 3 of the diffusivity in bulk water @xcite .",
    "so , it is a bit contradictory to consider them as acting as an impenetrable barrier against water transport .    in this work ,",
    "we limit our studies to simulations of hydrated lipid bilayers alone but include the minimal chemical details appropriate for the sc lipid matrix , and perform a series of molecular dynamics simulations to probe the permeability of the fully hydrated bilayers .",
    "ceramide sphingolipids contain a fatty acid tail attached to a sphingosine motif .",
    "the fatty acid tail is highly polydisperse in length @xcite . also , there are at least 9 different classes of ceramides in human stratum corneum , with slight variations of the head groups , and , in case of ceramide  1 , an additional esterified long fatty acid attached to the longer hydrocarbon tail .",
    "free fatty acids also have a large polydispersity _ in  vivo _ @xcite . for simplicity , we only consider ceramide  ns  24:0 ( ceramide 2 ) , with its fatty acid tail containing 24 carbons .",
    "similarly , the only free fatty acid we consider contains 24 carbon atoms .",
    "this particular length was chosen to represent the majority fraction of ceramide and free fatty acid present in the human stratum corneum @xcite .",
    "cer with their long asymmetric tails control the main distinguishing features of sc lipid membranes compared to phospholipids @xcite .",
    "the absence of any large head group leads to close packing of hydrocarbon tails .",
    "we have performed simulations of pure cer bilayers , along with more realistic bilayers with cer , chol and ffa present in either 1:1:1 or 2:2:1 molar ratios .",
    "simulation studies of water permeation for phospholipid bilayers , using very similar force - field as employed in this study , exist in literature at @xmath4 @xcite . to compare and contrast between phospholipid bilayers and sc lipid bilayer , we also simulated at @xmath4 .",
    "for the 2:2:1 composition ratio , where comparisons are made with experimental results , we have done additional simulations at @xmath0 .",
    "our main findings are that the diffusion of water molecules inside the lipid bilayer is highly anisotropic , and the excess chemical potential for water is much higher than in typical fluid phospholipid bilayers at the same temperature . in the presence of the high free energy barrier ,",
    "the simple absorption - diffusion picture , with which much of the experimental results are interpreted in the literature , is no longer valid .",
    "instead , the time taken by a water molecule to cross the bilayer is determined by the kramers first passage time across the bilayer .",
    "our results suggest that for water , the experimentally determined lag time and thickness of the stratum corneum can be reconciled without invoking concepts like tortuosity when the free energy barrier is accounted for correctly .",
    "to calculate the permeability coefficient from simulations , we constrain a water molecule at a fixed @xmath5 distance from the lipid bilayer mid - plane . here",
    ", the @xmath5 direction is the direction normal to the bilayer with the bilayer center of mass being at @xmath6 . in this paper",

    "the value of the local excess chemical potential can be calculated through numerical integration from the bulk water phase .",
    "the auto - correlation of the force is related to the diffusion coefficient through a kubo relation @xcite @xmath11 where , @xmath12 is the universal gas constant , @xmath13 the absolute temperature and @xmath14 . the macroscopic permeability coefficient @xmath15 , the ratio between the flux and concentration difference ( @xmath16 ) , is macroscopically defined through @xcite @xmath17 where the integration runs over the bilayer thickness .",

    "we find that , compared to phospholipids simulated with very similar force fields and at the same temperature as in this study , the sc bilayers show nearly twice as high a chemical potential barrier against water permeation .",
    "the high degree of correlation of the free energy profile with the lipid density profile suggests that the main reason for this large free energy barrier is because the ceramide lipids lead to dense packing of the acyl tails .",
    "water diffusivity across the bilayer does not change drastically as compared to phospholipids .",
    "high degree of tail ordering ensures that once the water molecule is inside the hydrocarbon region , it can move without large extra free energy cost along the chain - orientation direction .",
    "however , diffusivity in the perpendicular direction ( in - plane diffusivity ) is decreased by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the permeability coefficients from our simulations are much smaller than the experimental results . in our analysis",
    ", we showed that the high free energy barrier necessitates the use of a first passage time to estimate the lag time , and neglect of the barrier leads to an apparent pathlength that is much larger than the physical thickness of the sample .",

    "it is possible to discern the importance of the free energy barrier on the lag time from experiments at different temperatures .",

    "<S> stratum corneum , the outermost layer of skin , consists of keratin filled rigid non - viable corneocyte cells surrounded by multilayers of lipids . </S>",
    "<S> the lipid layer is responsible for the barrier properties of the skin . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the excess chemical potential and diffusivity of water as a function of depth in lipid bilayers with compositions representative of the stratum corneum using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum in the excess free energy of water inside the lipid bilayers is found to be twice that of water in phospholipid bilayers at the same temperature . </S>",
    "<S> permeability , which decreases exponentially with the free energy barrier , is reduced by several orders of magnitude as compared to with phospholipid bilayers . </S>",
    "<S> the average time it takes for a water molecule to cross the bilayer is calculated by solving the smoluchowski equation in presence of the free energy barrier . for a bilayer composed of a 2:2:1 molar ratio of ceramide  ns 24:0 , cholesterol and free fatty acid 24:0 at @xmath0 , we estimate the permeability @xmath1 and the average crossing time @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the permeability is about 30 times smaller than existing experimental results on mammalian skin sections . </S>"
