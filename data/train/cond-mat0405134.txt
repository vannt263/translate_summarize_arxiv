    "in ni@xmath5mnga heusler alloy , a structural transformation from cubic austenitic to tetragonal martensitic phase is observed upon cooling .",
    "the interest in the study of ni@xmath5mnga - based alloys has mainly been conditioned by the fact that the martensitic phase in these alloys is ferromagnetic .",
    "the combination of ferromagnetic ordering and martensitic transformation allows realization of magnetically driven shape memory effect , which expands considerably the area of technical applications of this effect .    despite a large number of experimental and theoretical studies ,",
    "many fundamental aspects of ni@xmath5mnga - based alloys are not clearly understood yet .",
    "for instance , magnetic properties of thoroughly studied ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga system were not sufficiently clarified . for these alloys , the compositional dependencies of curie temperature @xmath6 and martensite - austenite transformation temperature @xmath7 were determined but the temperature and compositional dependencies of magnetization have been not investigated in details . in particular , no systematic study was performed on the jump of magnetization at martensitic transition , which determines the shift of @xmath7 under external magnetic field .",
    "besides , the exchange interaction parameters have been not estimated for these alloys .",
    "all these factors are important to get a better insight into physical mechanisms , underlying the magnetically driven shape memory effect .",
    "this paper deals with a systematic study of magnetic properties of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga ( @xmath2 ) alloys .",
    "the high - temperature austenitic phase of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga heusler alloys has a cubic structure of fm@xmath8 m space group . a structural transition to a modulated tetragonal ( @xmath9 )",
    "phase is observed in these alloys on cooling .",
    "it is worth noting that the crystal structure and space group of the low - temperature phase is still a subject of controversy ( see , for example , refs .  ) which is aggravated by a compositional dependence of the crystal structure of martensite .",
    "thus , for example , recent results of high - resolution neutron diffraction  @xcite give ground to conclude that for the stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga composition the martensitic phase , being considered for a long time as a tetragonal , has indeed an orthorhombic symmetry of pnnm space group . the structural martensitic transformation in ni@xmath5mnga - based heusler alloys",
    "was described as driven by a band jahn - teller effect .",
    "@xcite    the martensitic transformation temperature @xmath7 , which is about 200  k in stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga , linearly increases with @xmath10 in ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga alloys and reaches about 330  k at @xmath11 ( ref .  ) .",
    "the alloys with a higher ni content were not studied so far .",
    "note that different values of @xmath7 are given in literature , indicating probably the sensitivity of physical properties of these alloys to structural disorder  @xcite and/or deviations from the nominal composition .",
    "the ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga alloys are ferromagnetic at low temperatures .",
    "the curie temperature @xmath6 is about 370  k in stoichiometric composition ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "@xmath6 approximately linearly decreases with increasing ni content , so that for @xmath13 curie temperature merges with the martensitic transformation temperature @xmath7 .",
    "hence , the alloys with @xmath14 experience a structural ( martensitic ) transition from paramagnetic austenite to ferromagnetic martensite . at the same time , the magnetic state of the alloys with a lower ni content does not change during martensitic transformation and both austenitic and martensitic phases are ferromagnetic .",
    "the martensitic transformation , however , influences the magnetic parameters of these alloys and reveals itself in a sharp change of magnetic anisotropy and magnetization saturation .",
    "@xcite    the neutron diffraction measurements of stoichiometric composition  @xcite show that the magnetic moment is localized mainly on mn atoms .",
    "the reported values of the mn magnetic moment range from 3.8 to 4.2 @xmath15 .",
    "the magnetic moment of ni atoms is considerably smaller , about 0.2 - 0.4 @xmath15 .",
    "the concentration dependence of magnetic moment in ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga alloys has been not reported .",
    "it is known only that magnetization saturation decreases with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "polycrystalline samples of ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga alloys were prepared by a conventional arc - melting method in the atmosphere of spectroscopically pure argon gas .",
    "the samples were homogenized at 1050  k for 9 days with subsequent quenching in ice water . for the measurements of physical properties",
    "those samples were used whose weight loss during arc - melting was less than 0.2% .",
    "the measurements of magnetic properties were performed on samples with @xmath10 = 0 , 0.04 , 0.08 , 0.12 , 0.16 , and 0.19 ; some measurements were also done on the sample with @xmath16 .",
    "the magnetization up to 5  t was measured in a temperature range 5  700  k by a squid magnetometer `` quantum design '' ; it was also measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) in magnetic fields up to 1.8  t. additionally , measurements in pulsed magnetic fields up to 10  t were performed .",
    "spontaneous magnetization @xmath17 at low temperatures was determined by linear extrapolation of @xmath18 dependencies from high fields .",
    "@xmath17 in the vicinity of curie temperature , where @xmath18 dependencies are non - linear , was estimated by belov - arrott method for second - order magnetic phase transitions . using this method ,",
    "the curie temperatures were determined for every alloys except the @xmath19 sample , where the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition is a first - order phase transition .",
    "the paramagnetic susceptibility of the alloys was defined from @xmath20 dependencies measured above @xmath6 up to 700  k in a magnetic field of 0.2  t.    the latent heat of martensitic transition was determined from differential scanning calorimetry , performed by a pyris-1 dsc equipment .",

    "temperature dependencies of spontaneous magnetization @xmath17 of the ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga alloys are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that @xmath17 gradually decreases with increasing temperature and exhibits a pronounced change ( smeared jump ) when approaching a certain temperature @xmath7 .",
    "this jump in magnetization is caused , as has been shown in numerous studies ,  @xcite by a structural phase transition from martensite to austenite . as evident from these measurements ,",
    "the austenitic phase is ferromagnetic above @xmath7 for @xmath21 , while in the @xmath19 alloy the transformation from martensite to austenite is accompanied by a transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state .",
    "the compositional dependence of the martensitic transformation temperature @xmath7 is shown in fig .",
    "this figure also shows the dependence of ferromagnetic ordering temperature @xmath6 on ni content @xmath10 .",
    "it is seen that both these dependencies are practically linear with @xmath7 increasing and @xmath6 decreasing with ni content .",
    "these temperatures merge in a range of @xmath22 .",
    "the phase diagram of the ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga system obtained in the present study is in good agreement with previously found one .",
    "@xcite    the magnetic moment of these alloys , @xmath23 , was obtained by extrapolation of @xmath3 to 0  k. it was found that @xmath23 approximately linearly decreases at substitution of mn by ni , as is shown in fig .",
    "the value of magnetic moment in the stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga appears to be close to those reported in others studies .",
    "@xcite    the @xmath3 dependencies in ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga alloys , shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "evidence that the change of spontaneous magnetization at martensite - austenite transformation increases with ni content .",
    "a jump of magnetization at this transition is also observed in magnetic fields larger than the saturation field , as is shown in fig .",
    "the compositional dependencies of the magnitudes of magnetization jump @xmath4 measured in various magnetic fields are shown in fig .",
    "5 .    as can be seen from fig .  4 , with increasing magnetic field the magnetization jumps shift to higher temperatures .",
    "this is due to the influence of magnetic field on martensitic transformation temperature .",
    "it follows from these measurements that the shift @xmath24 of @xmath7 under magnetic field increases weakly with ni content ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the influence of a magnetic field on the martensite - austenite transition temperature was studied only for @xmath12 ( ref .  ) and @xmath14 ( refs .  )",
    "compositions . for the stoichiometric composition",
    "the shift of @xmath7 under magnetic field was estimated as @xmath25  k / t .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath26 and @xmath19 compositions , @xmath27  k / t was reported in refs .  , whereas in ref .",
    "this quantity was estimated as 3.5  k / t .",
    "it is worth noting that the shift of @xmath7 is determined with a significant error .",
    "this is caused mainly by the fact that the jump of magnetization at martensitic transformation is broad which makes difficult correct determination of @xmath7 temperature .",
    "besides , martensitic transformation is a first - order structural phase transition and is characterized by a temperature hysteresis .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 temperature can differ from the temperature at which the jump of magnetization occurs .",
    "the most correct method to determine @xmath7 is to determine this temperature as the average of the temperatures , at which magnetization jump is observed on cooling and heating , respectively . in the present study , @xmath7 was determined as a temperature of the magnetization jump while heating the sample .",
    "the temperature hysteresis loop was measured for the @xmath19 sample .",
    "it was found ( see fig .",
    "4 ) that @xmath7 determined at increasing temperature differs from @xmath7 estimated from averaging of measurements in hysteretic regime by 23 k. the width of the temperature hysteresis loop is approximately the same in different magnetic fields , so the additional error in determination of the shift of @xmath7 caused by a magnetic field does not exceed 0.3  k.    .theoretical and experimental values of the shift @xmath28 of the martensitic transition temperature @xmath7 in a magnetic field @xmath29 = 2  t for ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that these calculations are based on assumptions that the magnetic moments of constituting atoms does not change with deviations from stoichiometry and that the ni atoms possess similar moments in different crystallographic sites . in general this is not the case , because magnetism of heusler alloys is described in a band model .",
    "it means that the values of magnetic moments depend on density of states at fermi level and on the exchange splitting parameter , being therefore the concentration and structure dependent values . as has been noted in ref .",
    ", in ni@xmath5mnx heusler alloys the distance between the atoms is sufficiently large so that direct overlap of electron orbitals is negligible and the delocalization effects are of secondary importance .",
    "therefore , in the first approximation a localized moments model is applicable for the description of magnetic properties of these alloys .",
    "however , from the results of magnetic and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of ni@xmath5mnga  @xcite it was concluded that in this alloy the mn magnetic moments are mainly localized , while ni magnetic moments are essentially delocalized .",
    "the character of magnetism can be judged from the comparison of the magnetic moments of the constituting atoms and their effective magnetic moments ( see table  2 ) .    in the model of localized magnetic moments for the spin - only state ( orbital moment",
    "is quenched ) the interrelation between effective magnetic moment and the moment in the magnetically ordered state is given by wohlfarth - rhodes equation    @xmath30    in the band model the value of @xmath31 calculated from eqn .",
    "( 3 ) should be smaller than the experimental value of the effective moment due to the influence of delocalization effects .",
    "the values of @xmath31 for the mn and ni subsystems are given in table  2 .",
    "as evident from these data , for both mn and ni subsystems @xmath32 and @xmath31 are close to each other , although in both cases @xmath31 is slightly smaller than @xmath32 . within the experimental error of the measurements",
    "the @xmath33 ratio is the same for both mn and ni subsystems .",
    "thus , present experimental data do not suggest that the ni subsystem is more delocalized that the mn one .        it should be understood , however , that the magnetic moments in the magnetically ordered state were determined in the martensitic phase , whereas the effective magnetic moments were calculated from the paramagnetic susceptibility measured in the austenitic state .",
    "it makes no difference if magnetism is described in the localized model , because in this case the magnitude of magnetic moment depends weakly on the crystallographic environment . in the band model ,",
    "magnetic moments depend on the degree of overlap of electron orbitals , which changes at structural transformation . because of this",
    ", a possibility that the magnetic moments will change at structural transition must not be ruled out .",
    "the qualitative arguments given above are supported by the experimental data reported in ref .  , which indicate that the magnetic moment of mn is the same in austenitic and martensitic phases , whereas magnetic moment of ni in austenitic phase is larger than that in the martensitic phase .",
    "the latter observation is conditioned by a higher density of states of ni at the fermi level in austenitic state than that in the martensitic state , as electronic structure calculations have revealed .",
    "@xcite    as evident from fig .  2 , curie temperature of the austenitic phase decreases at substitution of mn for ni .",
    "this is due to the fact that this substitution leads to an increase in the number of atoms with smaller magnetic moments .",
    "similar tendency takes place presumably for a virtual curie temperature of the martensitic phase .",
    "this follows from the observation that in the low - temperature martensitic phase magnetization of the ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga alloys with a higher @xmath10 decreases more rapidly with increasing temperature .",
    "the magnetization data shown in fig .  1 allow estimation of virtual curie temperature of the martensitic phase .",
    "8 shows temperature dependencies of reduced spontaneous magnetization @xmath34 of the alloys as a function of reduced temperature @xmath35 .",
    "it is seen that the magnetization of austenitic phase and the magnetization of martensitic phase change with temperature in different way , whereas the reduced magnetizations of these phases are similar for different compositions .",
    "it can be assumed that the difference in @xmath36 of martensite and austenite is due to the difference in their curie temperatures . comparing @xmath36 dependencies of martensitic and austenitic phases ,",
    "it is possible to reconstruct the virtual curie temperature of martensitic phase , which is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "it appears to be 17% higher than the curie temperature of austenitic state .",
    "this value is twice as large as that obtained from phenomenological landau theory .",
    "@xcite     as a function of reduced temperature @xmath37 for the ni@xmath0mn@xmath1ga alloys .",
    "the solid line is reduced magnetization of virtual martensitic phase.,width=264 ]    the larger value of curie temperature of martensite as compared to curie temperature of corresponding austenite is due to changes in interatomic distances and in overlap of electronic orbitals . as evident from the analysis of experimental data ,",
    "this effect can not be attributed solely to a change in the unit cell volume at martensitic transformation .",
    "indeed , a study of the influence of hydrostatic pressure on curie temperature @xmath6 and martensitic transformation temperature @xmath7 of stoichiometric ni@xmath5mnga  @xcite has shown that the exchange interaction of the austenite increases with decreasing unit cell volume .",
    "at the same time , it is known  @xcite that the unit cell volume of martensite is larger than that of austenite .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the primary role in martensitic transformation in ni@xmath5mnga heusler alloys belongs to the crystal lattice distortions .",
    "such a mechanism of the influence of a structural transition on exchange interaction in intermetallic compounds gd@xmath38(si@xmath39ge@xmath1)@xmath40 was discussed recently in ref .  .",
    "as evident from fig .  5",
    ", the magnitude of magnetization jump @xmath4 at structural transition strongly increases with ni content .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the increase of @xmath10 leads to the increase of @xmath7 . under these circumstances , the difference between magnetizations of martensite and austenite at @xmath7 increases as well .",
    "it is also seen from fig .  5 that the magnetization jumps @xmath4 at @xmath7 diminishes at increasing magnetic field , which is the most pronounced at high @xmath10 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath4 in the alloys with a small @xmath10 results from the fact that the martensitic transformation in these alloys occurs at temperatures far below curie temperature @xmath6 and therefore the influence of a magnetic field on magnetization is weak . in the alloys with a large @xmath10",
    ", @xmath7 is close to @xmath6 of the austenitic phase and the external field strongly affects magnetization of this phase , whereas magnetization of the martensitic phase depends weakly on the magnetic field .",
    "it has been already mentioned that the temperature of structural transition shifts to higher temperatures upon application of a magnetic field .",
    "such behavior is governed by the influence of zeeman energy , which stabilizes martensitic phase with a larger magnetization .",
    "experimental data on the shift of @xmath7 are presented in table  1 .",
    "these results indicate that for the alloys studied the shift is rather small ( 12  k as the magnetic field changes for 2  t ) and slightly enhances with increasing ni content .",
    "the table also contains theoretical estimation of the shift of @xmath7 in magnetic field , derived from a thermodynamical clapeyron - clausius relation for first - order phase transitions :    @xmath41    the agreement between experimental and theoretical values can be considered as satisfactory .",
