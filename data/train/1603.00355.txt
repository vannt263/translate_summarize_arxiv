    "as a quintessentially quantum - mechanical model and because of its relevance to the unsolved problem of high - temperature superconductivity , the @xmath6 two - dimensional ( 2d ) square - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet ( slhafm ) remains one of the most actively studied systems in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "it is described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the strength of the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction ) and , because of strong thermal and quantum fluctuations , is resistant to long - range order for temperatures @xmath9  k  [ ] .",
    "considerable theoretical attention has been paid to additions to this ideal model , including external magnetic fields , next - nearest - neighbor coupling , or departures from isotropy in the interactions . predicted consequences of such deviations include alterations to the excitation spectra  @xcite , changes in the universality class  @xcite , the emergence of exotic magnetic phases  @xcite , and the promotion of a variety of ordered states  @xcite .",
    "practical realizations of the slhafm involve crystalline materials that are inevitably three dimensional from a structural standpoint  @xcite ; this introduces possible interlayer magnetic coupling between adjacent square - lattice planes , which , if present , will raise the magnetic ordering temperature to non - zero values and , potentially , obscure the effects of the other perturbations  @xcite . reducing the interlayer coupling may allow the above effects to come to the fore , permitting the associated theoretical predictions to be investigated in the laboratory . in this context ,",
    "the closest experimental approximations to ideal 2d magnets have typically made use of copper - oxygen superexchange bonds  @xcite . however , crystal - engineering efforts have given rise to a number of reduced - dimensionality molecular candidates  @xcite in which the interlayer coupling is reduced to levels seen in the best inorganic materials . in this way it has been possible to show evidence of changes in universality class as a function of magnetic field in a molecular slhafm  @xcite .",
    "an added advantage of molecular systems is the ability to make controlled adjustments to the crystal structure , thereby tuning interaction strengths and better testing the predictions of the slhafm and associated models . to this end",
    ", we and others have previously shown that it is possible to gain a degree of control over the primary exchange energy in low - dimensional molecular antiferromagnets via constitutional changes that include deuteration  @xcite , anion substitution  @xcite , exchange of halide ligands  @xcite , and the application of high pressures  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine a family of materials based on 2d arrays of magnetic cu(ii ) ions linked by pyrazine ( c@xmath2h@xmath2n@xmath0 ) ligands in order to investigate the effects of tuning the interlayer coupling strength . by varying the layer separation through the interchange of axial ligands , we study to what extent the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature can be manipulated , and whether it is possible to approach the ideal 2d limit .",

    "the dipole interaction has a @xmath160 distance dependence  @xcite , which is similar to the estimate determined above by comparing the upper bounds of the interlayer exchange couplings in * 1 * and * 3*.    we have performed dipole - field calculations given a certain assumed collinear antiferromagnetic structure inspired by the structure suggested for * 4 * on the basis of neutron - diffraction experiments  @xcite .",
    "the calculations leave the direction of each individual moment variable . and hence allow the dipolar anisotropy to be determined for the assumed magnetic structure ; results are shown in table  [ magtab ] .",
    "the interlayer dipolar coupling @xmath112 decreases rapidly with interlayer separation and is largest for * 1*. for * 1 * and * 4 * @xmath112 is found to be similar to the magnitude of interlayer coupling necessary to account for the measured @xmath109 ratio , suggesting that dipolar interactions could play a significant role in driving the magnetic ordering in these compounds .",
    "we point out that our dipolar calculations assume an ordered moment size of 1@xmath161 .",
    "quantum fluctuations are expected to reduce the moment in reduced - dimensionality magnets and an ordered moment of 0.62@xmath161 is expected for the ideal 2d slhafm at zero temperature  @xcite . in such circumstances , the quoted energy scales of the dipolar interactions must hence be reduced by a factor of up to 0.38 . however , the ordered moment of cu(pyz)@xmath0(clo@xmath2)@xmath0 has been measured to be as low as @xmath162 ( see ref .  ) , so the dipolar interactions could potentially be reduced even further .",
    "the preceding analyses attribute the finite value of @xmath76 entirely to some kind of coupling between the copper - pyrazine planes .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the magnetic order in these types of material could be driven by a combination of interlayer coupling and spin - exchange anisotropy within the layers ( a departure from a heisenberg - type interactions )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14-factor anisotropy determined above shows that the spin - orbit coupling that gives rise to spin - exchange anisotropy is present in the materials considered here .",
    "the hamiltonian relevant to these systems is consequently amended to @xmath163 \\nonumber \\\\ + j_2 \\sum_{{\\left\\langle i , k\\right\\rangle}_{\\|}}{s_i \\cdot",
    "s_k }   + j_\\perp \\sum_{{\\left\\langle i , j\\right\\rangle}_{\\perp}}{s_i \\cdot s_j } \\nonumber \\\\   - g\\mu_{\\rm b}b \\sum_i{s_i^z } \\label{hamfull}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have included both nearest - neighbor ( @xmath122 ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath123 ) intralayer interactions , as well as the interlayer coupling ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "@xmath164 is the spin - exchange anisotropy parameter and is expected to be small and positive ( @xmath87-like ) for quasi - two - dimensional @xmath6 systems . ignoring the @xmath123 and @xmath91 terms , quantum - monte - carlo simulations predict a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless - type transition to three - dimensional magnetic order driven by even very small levels of spin exchange anisotropy  @xcite and obtain @xmath109 ratios similar to those measured here arising from @xmath165 .",
    "reference  , again neglecting any effects of @xmath123 , found evidence for spin - exchange anisotropy in low - field magnetization and low - temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements of several quasi - two - dimensional copper - pyrazine polymeric magnets , including compound * 4*. the observation of a change in slope , or kink , in @xmath94 obtained with the field applied parallel to the planes allowed the authors to conclude @xmath166 for * 4 *  [ ] . using neutron - spectroscopy measurements on the aforementioned compound , some of the same authors later determined values of @xmath167  k and @xmath168  [ ] .",
    "esr  @xcite and heat capacity  @xcite data were used to estimate @xmath169 and @xmath170 for the pf@xmath65 counterion analogues of * 1 * and * 2 * , respectively .",
    "low - field magnetization data taken using polycrystalline samples of * 1 * , * 2 * and * 3 * are shown in figure  [ kinkfig](a)-(c ) .",
    "these experiments were performed at 500  mk so that the sample is in the magnetically ordered state .",
    "figure  [ kinkfig](d ) shows similar data for * 4 * at 1.8  k taken from  @xcite . in this case , a single crystal was used and the magnetic field aligned both parallel and perpendicular to the cu  pyz planes .",
    "the kink in @xmath94 arising from the spin - exchange anisotropy is clearly observed with the parallel - field orientation .",
    "this kink occurs when the applied in - plane field is increased above the anisotropy field , @xmath171  [ ] . at this point",
    "the moments can begin to rotate out of the easy plane , leading to an enhancement in the dynamic susceptibility and hence a kink in the magnetization  @xcite .",
    "the equivalent feature in the data for the polycrystalline samples is reduced in clarity by comparison ; nevertheless , a change in slope is apparent for all compounds .",
    "the fields at which this kink appears , the anisotropy field @xmath172 , are determined from the position of the large peak in @xmath173 and are found to be 0.08  t ( * 1 * ) , 0.11  t ( * 2 * ) and 0.11  t ( * 3 * ) .",
    "@xmath164 can be found by taking the ratio of @xmath171 and @xmath89  [ ] and is found to be similar in magnitude ( @xmath174 ) for all members of the family .",
    "the size of the energy scale associated with this anisotropy is estimated from the product of @xmath8 and @xmath164 and these values are tabulated in table  [ magtab ] .    , are determined by the peaks in @xmath173 ( solid line ) .",
    "( e )  experimentally determined values of @xmath109 and the @xmath87-type spin exchange anisotropy , @xmath175 , for the compounds mentioned in the text ( points ) .",

    "( e )  experimentally determined values of @xmath109 and the @xmath87-type spin exchange anisotropy , @xmath175 , for the compounds mentioned in the text ( points ) .",
    "also shown is the theoretical relation ( line ) determined via quantum - monte - carlo simulations  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    if we assume that the polycrystalline compounds also exhibit an @xmath87-type anisotropy , we can determine the effect this has on the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "figure  [ kinkfig](e ) plots the experimental values of @xmath109 against @xmath164 for the four compounds , as well as some other quasi-2d copper - based antiferromagnets . also shown",
    "is the function @xmath176 which is empirically determined via quantum - monte - carlo calculations  @xcite and relates the ordering temperature to @xmath164 , assuming that the nearest - neighbor , anisotropic intralayer exchange is the only term in the hamiltonian ( i.e. neglecting @xmath123 and @xmath91 in equation  [ hamfull ] ) . following reference  , we expect that if an experimental point lies on this line then the ordering temperature can be entirely accounted for by the magnitude of @xmath164 .",
    "if , however , the point lies significantly above the theoretical curve , then the long - range ordering is being assisted by another process , such as interlayer coupling . as can be seen , the experimentally - derived data point for * 1 * , which has the shortest interlayer distance of our four materials , lies some way from the theoretical line , while * 4 * , with a slightly larger interlayer separation , is much closer .",
    "the points for compounds * 2 * and * 3 * , with their bulky axial ligands and therefore large separation between planes , lie close together , not far from the theoretical curve .",
    "this implies that interlayer coupling appears to becomes less important in determining the ordering temperature as the copper - pyrazine layers are forced apart .",
    "we can compare our results with those from related materials .",
    "as has been mentioned , [ cu(hf@xmath0)(pyz)@xmath0]pf@xmath60 has a higher @xmath8 , @xmath76 and @xmath164 than [ cu(hf@xmath0)(pyz)@xmath0]clo@xmath2 ( * 1 * ) . as a consequence",
    "the data point for this material lies closer to the theoretical prediction in figure  [ kinkfig](e ) than does compound * 1*. the measured interlayer separation in the pf@xmath60 material is 6.785    at 15  k , which is slightly larger than the equivalent distance of 6.594    measured in * 1 * at 50  k. also shown in the graph are the points for [ cu(pyo)@xmath0(pyz)@xmath0](pf@xmath60)@xmath0 and cu(pyz)@xmath0(bf@xmath2)@xmath0  @xcite , but as the structures of these compounds are not known at 100  k or below , a comparison with our materials is difficult .",
    "the data point for the former material lies right on the theoretical curve .",
    "its interlayer separation at room temperature is known to be 13.189   , compared with 12.471    at the same temperature for * 2 * , thus reinforcing the trend . however , at low temperatures this separation will certainly not be as big as that for * 3 * with the large 4-phpyo ligands , suggesting that factors beyond just the interlayer separation are important for understanding how the different interactions determine the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "new theoretical models will have to be developed in order to achieve an independent estimate of both @xmath164 and @xmath91 from the hamiltonian in equation  [ hamfull ] .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ kinkfig](e ) implies that the magnetic order observed in compounds * 2 * and * 3 * is predominantly driven by the spin exchange anisotropy . in contrast , in order to account for the transition temperature of compound * 1 * , @xmath164 would have to be at least an order of magnitude larger than is measured .",
    "therefore , interlayer couplings , probably including dipolar interactions , must play an important role in stabilising the ordered state of this material .",
    "we have engineered a family of molecular materials [ cu(hf@xmath0)(pyz)@xmath0]clo@xmath2 ( * 1 * ) , [ cu@xmath3(pyz)@xmath0](clo@xmath2)@xmath0 [ @xmath4 = pyo ( * 2 * ) and 4-phpyo ( * 3 * ) ] that exhibit highly-2d antiferromagnetism . by changing the axial ligands we have shown that it is possible to vary considerably the interlayer spacings in these materials while at the same time retaining the copper - pyrazine nearly - square - lattice motif to a very good precision . by developing a consistent esr measurement procedure in conjunction with pulsed - field magnetometry ,",
    "we have shown that the ligand substitution has only a small effect on the single - ion properties or the magnitude of effective nearest - neighbor exchange interactions within the 2d layers .",
    "long - range magnetic order is observed in all members of the family and the ordering temperatures are found to decrease relatively slowly with increasing interlayer separation , varying at a rate of @xmath177  mk /  .",
    "this slow variation implies that other mechanisms in addition to or besides interlayer superexchange drive the ordering transition . by determining the anisotropy fields in these materials",
    "we conclude that a combination of spin - exchange anisotropy and interlayer coupling ( superexchange and/or dipolar interactions ) gives rise to the observed transition temperatures in these materials .",
    "in particular , the small spin - exchange anisotropy in the intralayer exchange interaction becomes increasingly more dominant in determining the long - range ordering temperature as the layer spacing increases .",
    "cu(pyz)@xmath0(clo@xmath2)@xmath0 ( * 4 * ) is a well - known molecular antiferromagnet , and has similar copper - pyrazine planes to our family of compounds .",
    "nevertheless , the intralayer exchange energy @xmath8 , and ( hence ) the magnetic ordering temperature , are significantly higher for this material , reminiscent of the larger values of @xmath8 found in some members of the the [ cu(hf@xmath0)(pyz)@xmath0]@xmath64 family of polymers . to fully determine how this difference arises , as well as to ascertain in more general terms the means by which exchange is mediated through pyrazine and other molecular ligands , considerable further work ( e.g. density functional theory , neutron scattering , spin density mapping ) will be required .",
    "our results imply that characterising the mechanism of the in - plane symmetry breaking in real examples of highly two - dimensional @xmath6 antiferromagnets is necessary to achieve a complete understanding of their phase diagram and particularly the precise nature of the ordered phases observed at very low temperatures ( e.g. nel , berezinsky  kosterlitz  thouless , or 3d xy ) .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that similar considerations regarding in - plane symmetry are probably vital for explaining the high - temperature superconductivity observed in under - doped cuprates ( see ref .   and references therein ) , whose parent phase is also a quasi - two - dimensional @xmath6 square - lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "in addition , our data provide guidelines for future attempts to create extremely two - dimensional quantum magnets with highly suppressed ordering temperatures , thereby engineering a magnetic system in close proximity to a quantum critical point in the temperature - coupling phase diagram .",
    "clearly it is not sufficient to curb the interlayer coupling alone ; even in @xmath6 systems efforts must be taken to suppress any intralayer magnetic anisotropy .",
    "we point out that for the related material [ cu(hf@xmath0)(pyz)@xmath0]sbf@xmath60 it was not possible to detect any spin - exchange anisotropy using either magnetometry or neutron diffraction down to the lowest temperature measured  @xcite , suggesting that the observed transition to long - range order is driven predominantly by interlayer coupling . that material , unlike the systems considered here , has tetragonal structural symmetry in the ordered phase , and it is probable that the magnetic anisotropy we observe in our materials is linked to their reduced structural symmetry .",
    "whether it is possible to produce a molecule - based material with tetragonal symmetry at low temperatures _ and _ a large interlayer spacing is the subject of continuing research .",

    "<S> using a mixed - ligand synthetic scheme , we create a family of quasi - two - dimensional antiferromagnets , namely , [ cu(hf@xmath0)(pyz)@xmath0]clo@xmath2 [ pyz = pyrazine ] , [ cu@xmath3(pyz)@xmath0](clo@xmath2)@xmath0 [ @xmath4 = pyo = pyridine - n - oxide and 4-phpyo = 4-phenylpyridine - n - oxide . </S>",
    "<S> these materials are shown to possess equivalent two - dimensional [ cu(pyz)@xmath0]@xmath5 nearly square layers , but exhibit interlayer spacings that vary from 6.5713    to 16.777   , as dictated by the axial ligands . </S>",
    "<S> we present the structural and magnetic properties of this family as determined via x - ray diffraction , electron - spin resonance , pulsed- and quasistatic - field magnetometry and muon - spin rotation , and compare them to those of the prototypical two - dimensional magnetic polymer cu(pyz)@xmath0(clo@xmath2)@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , within the limits of the experimental error , the two - dimensional , _ intralayer _ exchange coupling in our family of materials remains largely unaffected by the axial ligand substitution , while the observed magnetic ordering temperature ( 1.91  k for the material with the hf@xmath0 axial ligand , 1.70  k for the pyo and 1.63  k for the 4-phpyo ) decreases slowly with increasing layer separation . despite the structural motifs common to this family and cu(pyz)@xmath0(clo@xmath2)@xmath0 , the latter has significantly stronger two - dimensional exchange interactions and hence a higher ordering temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these results , as well as the mechanisms that might drive the long - range order in these materials , in terms of departures from the ideal @xmath6 two - dimensional square - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that both spin exchange anisotropy in the intralayer interaction and interlayer couplings ( exchange , dipolar , or both ) are needed to account for the observed ordering temperatures , with the intralayer anisotropy becoming more important as the layers are pulled further apart . </S>"
