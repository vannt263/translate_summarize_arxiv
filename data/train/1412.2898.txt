    "unique superconducting ( sc ) properties in the high field region of the quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath2-wave superconductor cecoin@xmath0 and , in particular , the presence of its additional high field sc phase ( hfsp ) in the in - plane field configuration have attracted much interest so far . in 2003 , this hfsp has been discovered @xcite and , based on the fact that this material shows an unusually strong paramagnetic pair - breaking ( ppb ) , has been identified with a realization of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite as a vortex phase @xcite .",
    "after that , an antiferromagnetic or spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order has been detected in hfsp in a neutron - scattering measurement @xcite .",
    "different models have been proposed to explain why this sdw order occurs _ only _ in this high field region of the @xmath3-wave sc phase . some of them have found its origin in the strong ppb @xcite , while the others have ascribed its origin to other aspects such as the vortex lattice structure @xcite , fflo modulation @xcite , and an additional @xmath1-triplet order @xcite .",
    "recently , a neutron scattering measurement has been reported @xcite which detects a sudden change of the direction of the sdw modulation occurring when the magnetic field is rotated within the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane through a crystal main axis [ 100 ] . in the field precisely parallel to [ 100 ] , the incommensurate part @xmath6 of the sdw modulation vector can take either of two degenerate directions parallel to the gap nodes of the @xmath3-pairing function .",
    "the experiment indicates that even a tiny deviation of the field direction from [ 100 ] to [ 110 ] ( [ 1@xmath70 ] ) lifts this degeneracy and results in a _ discontinuous _ rotation of @xmath6 to the [ 1@xmath70 ] ( [ 110 ] ) direction .",
    "the authors have argued @xcite that the scenario @xcite requiring the presence of the triplet pairing in hfsp , which induces the sdw order in the @xmath3-wave pairing state , is promising and that the pictures ascribing the origin of the sdw _ only _ to some spatial modulation of the sc order parameter are not relevant to this phenomenon .",
    "previously , the present authors have proposed the picture @xcite that hfsp of cecoin@xmath0 is a coexistent phase of two orders induced by strong ppb , i.e. , the sdw order created by an interplay between the @xmath3-wave sc pairing and ppb and the fflo sc order with a spatial modulation parallel to the field .",
    "the fact that this hfsp is extremely sensitive @xcite to the purity of the material has been previously interpreted as an evidence of the presence of a spatial modulation parallel to the applied field @xcite .",
    "further , nmr data have clarified a field - dependence of the quasiparticle weight in hfsp which is consistent only with the scenario @xcite invoking the presence of nodal planes perpendicular to the field @xcite .",
    "therefore , it should be clarified whether the neutron data @xcite is consistent or not with this fflo picture .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically examine a sudden switching @xcite of the magnetic domain upon the in - plane field rotation in hfsp of the superconductor cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "first , we point out that such a switching of the sdw modulation direction does not occur in any state with a spatially uniform sc order parameter @xcite and show in details that this phenomenon is explained within the picture of the ppb - induced sdw order and without assuming the @xmath1-triplet order if hfsp includes the fflo spatial modulation parallel to the field @xcite .",
    "this result implies that the strong ppb is the main origin of the presence of hfsp and the sdw order there .    in sec.ii ,",

    "the sign of @xmath98 and @xmath99 is determined by trigonometric factors of different origins , the ppb effect due to the zeeman energy , the @xmath6-direction reflected in @xmath100 , and effects of a nonvanishing @xmath53 .",

    "the expressions are symmetric in the sign of @xmath107 , and thus , the two configurations symmetric with respect to [ 100 ] are degenerate in energy with each other .",
    "further , the @xmath79-values in the present system with strong ppb is not so large that the two - fold symmetry due to the vortices in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane is a weaker effect compared with the four - fold symmetry of the pairing function @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , the free energy density @xmath65 has its extreme values around @xmath108 , while the curvature @xmath109 depends on the magnitude of the incommensurability @xmath110 .",
    "typically , for larger @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , @xmath65 is minimized around @xmath113 ( see fig.3 ) .",

    "the value @xmath114 has been used .",
    "once @xmath10 becomes nonzero , however , the degeneracy is lifted by the presence of the vortices and the fflo modulation .",
    "interestingly , these two effects favor _ different _ orientations of @xmath6 from each other . to see this , let us first focus on the @xmath115 case , i.e. , the ordinary vortex lattice with no fflo modulation , by assuming @xmath116",
    ". as fig.3(b ) shows , the free energy in lower fields than hfsp , i.e. , @xmath117 , is lower when @xmath118 , implying the tendency that @xmath6 is oriented along the vortex axis parallel to @xmath11 .",
    "this feature has also been verified elsewhere @xcite .",
    "if hfsp is merely a coexistent phase of the ordinary vortex lattice with the @xmath3-wave sc pairing and a sdw order @xcite , @xmath119 would has the same sign as that of @xmath10 , in contrast to the experimental observation @xcite .",
    "therefore , hfsp must have a different factor for changing the sign of @xmath119 . according to the original proposal on hfsp of cecoin@xmath0 @xcite",
    ", we next examine the corresponding results in the case with the fflo modulation . in eq.(5 ) , the sign of @xmath119 minimizing the free energy is determined by keeping the sign of the product of two kinds of trigonometric factors , the factor including @xmath6 and that including @xmath53 , unchanged : for instance , in @xmath99 , the sign of @xmath120 is reversed by a large change of @xmath6-direction , because the dominant @xmath101-direction is , as already mentioned , limited by the orbital pair - breaking , and this sign reversal is compensated rather by sign changes of other trigonometric factors including @xmath53 .    in fig.4",
    ", the resulting @xmath10-dependence of @xmath119 is shown as a solid curve .",
    "the use of eq.(3 ) with a nonzero @xmath53 leads to the result that the free energy is lowered in the configuration with @xmath121 , suggesting that the orientation @xmath122 is favored , in contrast to that in the @xmath115 case . in a narrow region in the close vicinity of the second order transition entering hfsp where @xmath123 is small ( @xmath124 ) , the configuration @xmath125 is realized , as in the low field vortex lattice ( see fig.2 ) . for larger",
    "@xmath126 of order unity , however , the fflo modulation acts on the @xmath6 orientation more strongly than the anisotropy due to the vortices , and the configuration @xmath121 results in , although @xmath119 favors values , more or less , close to @xmath127 due to the four - fold symmetry of the gap function @xmath128 .",
    "physically , it implies that @xmath6 tends to be oriented along the fflo nodal planes .",
    "this `` pinning '' of @xmath6 to the nodal planes seems to be the origin of the quick approach of the @xmath6-vector to [ 1@xmath70 ] as @xmath10 is slightly increased from zero .",
    "in fact , it is clear from fig.1 that , according to the above - mentioned pinning effect , the tilt of the nodal plane due to a slight and positive ( negative ) @xmath10 favors @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "further , since the effect of the fflo modulation on the @xmath6-orientation is much bigger for the ppb strength used here ( see fig.3 ) than that of the in - plane anisotropy due to the vortices , a change of @xmath10 at @xmath45 [ 100 ] with @xmath125 , expected in the ordinary vortex lattice , does not occur in this case .",
    "in addition , the feature seen in the solid curve of fig.4 that @xmath131 for smaller @xmath132 values can also be understood from fig.1 by taking account of this pinning of @xmath6 to the nodal planes .    the dashed curve in fig.4 shows the corresponding @xmath119 v.s .",

    "<S> resolving the high - field superconducting phase ( hfsp ) , often called as the q - phase , and the antiferromagnetic or spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order appearing in the phase remains a crucial issue on the superconductor cecoin@xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> this result corroborates the picture that hfsp of cecoin@xmath0 and the sdw order found only in the phase are consequences of the strong paramagnetic pair - breaking in this @xmath2-wave superconductor . </S>"
