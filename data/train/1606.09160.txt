    "the quest for the experimental investigation of hot and dense strongly interacting matter has always had a fruitful connection to hydrodynamics .",
    "the development of hydrodynamical models that incorporate more and more details about the expansion dynamics of the matter produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions has been going together hand - in - hand with the richer and richer experimental observations on the particle production mechanism . from the early days of statistical modelling of multiplicity distributions in high - energy collisions ( pioneered by fermi ) through the hydrodynamical description of rapidity distributions ( by the famous landau - khalatnikov solution  @xcite as well as the hwa - bjorken solution  @xcite ) nowadays we have various exact analytic as well as numerical solutions of hydrodynamics at hand .",
    "these strive to describe refined observations on essentially three - dimensional momentum spectra ( rapidity as well as transverse mass distributions along with vaious order azimuthal anisotropies ) , two - particle bose - einstein ( also named hbt ) correlations with resolving power on average momentum , azimuthal angle , and many other observables .",
    "it is impossible to review all these developments here ; for a brief summary of hydrodynamical modeling , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "a relatively recent research direction in heavy - ion physics phenomenology is to take the rotation of the created matter into account . in non - central heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the non - zero initial angular momentum of the matter influences the time evolution , and numerical modellings of this rotation ( of which now there are many , some pioneering work is to be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) predict effects on several observables . according to these models",
    ", the effect of rotation can generally be thought of as that of an effective radial flow  @xcite that influences the spectra , the elliptic flow as well as two - particle hbt correlations .",
    "an equally important prediction was that assuming local thermal equilibrium for spin degrees of freedom  @xcite , baryons will be produced with non - zero polarization from a rotating system  @xcite . to observe this , @xmath0 baryons are promising candidates , since their polarization can be measured with current experimental setup , by studying their decay kinematics .    on another notice ,",
    "it was known for long that particle production from an ellipsoid - like source results in a characteristic oscillation of the hbt radius parameters as a function of pair azimuthal angle , and if the ellipsoid is tilted in coordinate space by a fixed angle , it results in the appearance of new cross - terms in the gaussian approximation of the correlation function .",
    "a simple model with these features can be read in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a more advanced , exact hydrodynamical derivation is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . refs .",
    "@xcite also proposed the differential hbt method to infer the angular momentum of the fireball , although it was pointed out that it is hard to disentangle the effects of rotation on the hbt radii .",
    "nowadays one of the most interesting questions in heavy - ion physics concerns the existence ( and if it exists , the location ) of a critical endpoint on the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter , as well as the precise experimental determination of the location of the quark - hardon transition on this phase diagram .",
    "already some finite - size scaling investigations of measured system sizes and freeze - out durations in heavy - ion collisions suggest that the critical endpoint is in reach with current beam energies at the rhic accelerator  @xcite .",
    "however , as of now , much additional work is needed to underpin this statement and to explore the phenomenological properties of this transition .",
    "one means to this end is to systematically investigate the equation of state of the produced matter as a function of beam energy .",
    "the determination of the rotation of the system can give a very useful input to achieve this goal .",
    "the importance of rotation  besides that as an effect that influences final state observables , it is interesting on its own  is that the time evolution of the angular velocity of an expanding system depends on how violent is the expansion , which in turn depends on the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter .",
    "the main reasons behind this are easy to grasp . on one hand , if the initial energy density is fixed , then a softer eos results in less rapid increase of the moment of inertia ( because of lower pressure ) , which leads to higher angular velocity as compared to the case of a stiffer eos .",
    "another effect is that adiabatic expansion of a substance with a softer eos means slower decrease of the temperature for a given volume change , meaning that there is more time for the system to rotate before reaching the freeze - out temperature , where the final state observables take their values . in the following",
    "we will demonstrate how the interplay of these two effects influence the final rotation angle of the expanding system .",
    "rotation is also noteworthy because if one wants to investigate the eos of the matter using hadronic final state observables , it is important to have knowledge on the initial conditions of the flow , since different initial conditions and equations of state can lead to similar final states , making the final state taken alone incapable of determining the eos .",
    "the initial rotational angle of the system can be thought of as either zero or at least as a monotonic function of the energy of the colliding heavy ions , while the eos  and thus the final rotation angle  is not necessarily monotonic : when searching for the critical point via the softening of the eos , it is precisely such a non - monotonic behavior that one is looking for .",
    "the vast work in the field of numerical hydrodynamics and models based on analytic solutions of hydrodynamics supplement each other well .",
    "analytic models that use exact solutions of both relativistic and non - relativistic hydrodynamics for the description of particle production are naturally harder to find and more specialized in their initial conditions , but once found , they give general insights in the mechanisms involved in the origin of observables .    as far as we know ,",
    "the first rotating solutions of relativistic perfect fluid hydrodynamics were found by the simultaneous solution of collisionless boltzmann equation  @xcite and the equations of perfect fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "recent developments concerning exact relativistic and non - relativistic hydrodynamical solutions with rotation were found also in the framework of ads / cft correspondence . given that high energy heavy ion collisions and quark - gluon plasmas ( qgp - s ) produced in these collisions are generically endowed with very large angular momenta , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed to incorporate angular momentum in holographic models . in the case in which the plasma rotates ,",
    "allowing for a non - vanishing initial angular momentum usefully improves holographic estimates of the value of the quark chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that local rotation has effects on the qgp at high values of the baryonic chemical potential , which are not only of the same kind as those produced by magnetic fields , but which can in fact be substantially larger .",
    "furthermore , the combined effect of rotation and magnetism is to change the shape of the main quark matter phase transition line in an interesting way , reducing the magnitude of its curvature  @xcite .",
    "rotation ( local vorticity ) and non - vanishing shear stress was also investigated in the solutions found in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "these results gave much thrust to the effort to better understand the rotational expansion of heavy ion collisions and to disentangle the various effects of the rather high initial angular momentum in these collisions .",
    "in this paper we present a rotating exact solution of the non - relativistic hydrodynamical equations , that is well suited to the geometrical picture of the strongly interacting matter created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the presented solution features ellipsoidal level surfaces of temperature as well as density , with three different principal axes .",
    "it is a natural generalization of our earlier results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , where we explored exact analytic non - relativistic rotating spheroidal solutions ( where the two principal axes of the level surface ellipsoids perpendicular to the rotation is equal to each other ) , as well as the effect of rotation on the observables .",
    "our new solution also fits into a long line of self - similar but not rotating solutions of hydrodynamics , both relativistic and non - relativistic ones  @xcite .",
    "these solutions , as well as the so - called buda - lund hydrodynamical parametrization  @xcite , that gives a reasonable relativistic extension of them , have proven to be adequate tools in the description of hadronic observables .    the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ s : basics ]",
    "we recite the hydrodynamical equations suited for the treatment of our problem at hand .",
    "it turns out that the solution that we are after can be easily written up in a rotating reference frame instead of the laboratory frame of the colliding nuclei . in section  [ s :",
    "solution ] we present the solution for an expandig rotating triaxial ellipsoid ( i.e. an ellipsoid with three different principal axes ) : section  [ ss : hydrosol ] presents the solution itself in a compact way ( those interested only in this should look up this section ) , while discussion is left to sections  [ ss : analysis ] and [ ss : conserved ] , and technical details about the derivation is left to appendix  [ s : app : generalsol ] . in section  [",

    "the detailed investigation of the available experimental data is beyond the scope of this paper , however , we point out that the simultaneous measurement of the harmonic flow parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and the azimuthal oscillation of hbt radii ( especially the cross - terms in the so - called bertsch - pratt parametrization ) gives a means to determine the angular velocity as well as the final tilt angle of the ellipsoidal expanding system , providing a path to determine the softest point of the equation of state as outlined above . finally we summarize and conclude .",

    "we pointed out that in the general case of rotating _ and _ tilted source ( on which our exact ellipsoidal hydrodynamical solution gives a fairly reasonable picture ) the tilt angle of the ellipsoidal system is not identical to the tilt angle of the single - particle spectrum or that of the hbt correlation function .",
    "we derived expressions that connect these variables , and demonstrated their time dependence ( and their values taken at the freeze - out of the hydrodynamical evolution ) for a reasonable set of initial conditions , although a more detailed investigation of this dependence is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in particular , we argued that the tilt angle observable from the oscillating hbt radii and from the single - particle spectrum becomes a non - monotonic function at the softest point of the equation of state , which suggest that this variable will be useful and straightforward to measure observable to signal the qcd critical point .",
    "we have also found that in the longitudinal center of mass system of the boson pairs the out - long and the side - long cross - terms oscillate for rotating and expanding triaxial hydrodynamical systems and they are phase - shifted by @xmath311 as compared to one another , providing straighforward experimental testing possibilitiy for the qualitative features obeyed by in our new , rotating and expanding , triaxial ellipsoidal hydrodynamical solutions .",

    "<S> we calculate the hadronic final state observables such as single - particle spectra , directed , elliptic and third flows , as well as hbt correlations and corresponding radius parameters , utilizing simple analytic formulas . </S>",
    "<S> the final tilt angle of the fireball , an important observable quantity , is shown to be not independent of its exact definition : one gets different tilt angles from the geometrical anisotropies , from the single - particle spectra , and from hbt measurements . taken together , the tilt angle in the momentum space and in the relative momentum or hbt variable may be sufficient for the determination of the magnitude of the rotation of the fireball . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that observing this rotation and its dependence on collision energy could characterize the softest point of the equation of state . thus determining the rotation may be a powerful tool for the experimental search for the critical point in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter . </S>"
