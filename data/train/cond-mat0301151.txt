    "many complex systems , including social , biological , physical , economic , and computer systems , can be studied using network models in which the nodes represent the constituents and links or edges represent the interactions between constituents @xcite .",
    "one of important measures of the topological structure of a network is its connectivity distribution @xmath6 , which is defined as the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly @xmath7 edges . in traditional random graphs",
    "@xcite as well as in the small - world networks @xcite the connectivity distribution shows exponential decay in the tail .",
    "however , empirical studies on many real networks showed that the connectivity distribution exhibits a power law behavior @xmath8 for large @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "networks with power - law connectivity distributions are called _ scale - free _ ( sf ) networks . typical examples of sf networks include the internet @xcite , world - wide - web @xcite , scientific citations @xcite , cells @xcite , the web of actors @xcite , and the web of human sexual contacts @xcite .",
    "the first model of sf networks was proposed by barabsi and albert ( ba ) @xcite . in ba networks two important ingredients",
    "are included in order to obtain power law behavior in the connectivity distributions , namely the networks are continuously _ growing _ by adding in new nodes as time evolves , and the newly added nodes are _ preferentially attached _ to the highly connected nodes .",
    "the idea of incorporating preferential attachment in a growing network has led to proposals of a considerable number of models of sf networks @xcite ( see also refs . @xcite and references therein ) .    in most growing network models ,",
    "all the links are considered equivalent . however , many real systems display different interaction strengths between nodes .",
    "it has been shown that in systems such as the social acquaintance network @xcite , the web of scientists with collaborations @xcite , and ecosystems @xcite , links between nodes may be different in their influence and the so - called the weak links play an important role in governing the network s functions .",
    "therefore , real systems are best described by weighted growing networks with non - uniform strengths of the links . only recently",
    ", a class of models of weighted growing networks was proposed by yook , jeong and barabsi ( yjb ) @xcite . in the basic weighted scale - free ( wsf ) model of yjb , both the topology and the weight are driven by the connectivity according to the preferential attachment rule as the network grows .",
    "it was found that the total weight distribution follows a power law @xmath9 , with an exponent @xmath2 different from the connectivity exponent @xmath5 .",
    "it was also shown analytically that the different scaling behavior in the weight and connectivity distributions are results of strong logarithmic corrections , and asymptotically ( i.e. , in the long time limit ) the weighted and un - weighted models are identical @xcite .    in real systems",
    "one would expect that a link s weight and/or the growth rate in the number of links of a node depend not only on the  popularity \" of the node represented by the connectivity , but also on some intrinsic quality of the node .",
    "the intrinsic quality can be collectively represented by a parameter referred to as the  fitness \" @xcite . besides popularity",
    ", the competitiveness of a node in a network may depend , taking for example a node being an individual in a certain community , on the personality , survival skills , character , etc .. a newly added node may take into account of these factors beside popularity in their decision on making connections with existing nodes and on the importance of each of the established links .",
    "clearly , there is always a spectrum of personality among the nodes and therefore a distribution in the fitness . while one may argue that factors determining the popularity may overlap with those in fitness , it is not uncommon that popularity is not the major factor on the importance of a connection .",
    "for example , we often hear that a popular person actually has very few good friends , and an influential and powerful figure in a network may often be someone very difficult to work with . in the present work ,",
    "we generalize the wsf model of yjb to study the effects of fitness . in our model ,",
    "the weights assigned to the newly added links are determined stochastically either by the connectivity with probability @xmath0 or by the fitness of nodes with probability @xmath1 .",
    "the scaling behavior of the total weight distribution is found to be highly sensitive to the weight assignment mechanism through the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we present our model and simulation results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : solution ] , we derive an analytical expression between the total weight and the total connectivity of a node and provide a theoretical explanation on the features observed in the numerical results .",
    "results on a generalized model with a fitness - dependent link formation mechanism are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , together with a summary of results .",
    "the topological structure of our model follows that of the ba model of sf networks @xcite .",
    "a small number ( @xmath10 ) of nodes are created initially . at each time step , a new node @xmath11 with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) links is added to the network .",
    "these @xmath12 links will connect to @xmath12 pre - existing nodes in the system according to the preferential attachment rule that the probability @xmath14 of an existing node @xmath15 being selected for connection is proportional to the total number of links @xmath16 that node @xmath15 carries , i.e. , @xmath17 the procedure creates a network with @xmath18 nodes and @xmath19 links after @xmath20 time steps .",
    "geometrically , the network displays a connectivity distribution with a power law decay in the tail with an exponent @xmath21 , regardless of the value of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a weighted growing network is constructed by assigning weights to the links as the network grows . to incorporate a fitness - dependent weight assignment mechanism ,",
    "a fitness parameter @xmath22 is assigned to each node @xcite .",
    "the fitness @xmath22 is chosen randomly from a distribution @xmath23 , which is assumed to be a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath24 $ ] for simplicity .",
    "with probability @xmath0 , each newly established link @xmath25 is assigned a weight @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a sum over the @xmath12 nodes to which the new node @xmath11 is connected .",

    "the weights are driven entirely by the fitness of the nodes . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the present model provides a possible stochastic weight assignment scheme in which a newly added node , e.g. representing some newcomer into a web , considers either the popularity , or the fitness of its connected neighbor in determining the influence of such a connection .",
    "we performed extensive numerical simulations on the model . in our simulations , we studied networks up to @xmath34 nodes with @xmath35 . for each value of @xmath0 ,",
    "results are obtained by averaging over 10 independent runs .",
    "first we study the total weight distribution @xmath36 , which is defined as the probability that a randomly selected node has a total weight @xmath37 .",
    "the total weight of a node @xmath15 is given by the sum of the weights of all links connected to it , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "figure 1 shows that @xmath36 behaves as a power law @xmath39 , with an exponent @xmath2 that decreases from the value of @xmath40 at @xmath3 continuously as @xmath0 increases . for @xmath32 , @xmath41 , a result in agreement with that of the wsf model of yjb @xcite . for @xmath3 , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) showing that @xmath36 follows the same scaling behavior as @xmath6 .",
