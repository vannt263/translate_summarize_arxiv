    "large dense matrices arising out of many applications such as integral equations , interpolation , inverse problems , etc . , can be efficiently represented as hierarchical matrices , which are data sparse representations of certain class of dense matrices .",
    "detailed discussions on different hierarchical matrix structures can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the fmm enables computing fast matrix vector products for a sub - class of these hierarchical matrices , i.e. , obtaining @xmath5 , where the matrix @xmath6 is a fmm matrix at a computational cost of @xmath7 , given a tolerance @xmath8 . in this article",
    ", we provide an algorithm to answer the opposite question :     can we construct a direct solver for the linear system @xmath9 , given the right hand side @xmath10 and a specified error tolerance @xmath8 , where @xmath6 is a fmm matrix at a computational cost of @xmath7 ? \"    traditionally , solving linear systems of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath6 is a fmm matrix has been done using iterative solver . however , in recent times , there has been an increasing focus on constructing fast direct solvers for these hierarchical matrices  @xcite .",
    "this endeavor has been fruitful in the case of hierarchical matrices with weak - admissibility criteria ( strong low - rank structure ) , i.e. , the interaction between non - overlapping regions is represented as a low - rank interaction .",
    "this includes the hodlr  @xcite and hss matrices  @xcite .",
    "however , the weak admissibility criteria ( strong low - rank structure ) is restrictive .",
    "the rank of the non - overlapping clusters is more or less constant for problems arising out of @xmath11d manifolds but is no longer valid for singular green s function of elliptic pde s on @xmath4d and @xmath12d manifolds , i.e. , the rank of interaction between neighboring clusters is no longer independent of @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , the rank grows as @xmath14 on @xmath4d manifolds and grows as @xmath15 on @xmath12d manifolds .",
    "hence , the scaling of existing fast direct solvers is no longer linear in higher dimensions .",
    "this article addresses this issue by constructing a fast direct solver , which relies only on compressing the interaction corresponding to non - neighboring clusters .",
    "more precisely , the article presents a new fast direct solver for solving linear systems of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an fmm matrix , in @xmath7 operations with a controllable error @xmath8 .",
    "the algorithm also extends to the more general class of matrices known as @xmath0 matrices ( hierarchical matrices with nested basis ) with strong admissibility criteria ( weak low - rank structure ) .    below are the class of problems that the solver proposed in this article is capable of solving .    1 .",
    "* integral equations : * integral equations arising from elliptic partial differential equations are of the form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the unknown function and @xmath21 are known functions .",

    "the nested low - rank decomposition of the well - separated clusters are obtained using chebyshev interpolation by using @xmath26 chebyshev nodes along one dimension , i.e. , a total of @xmath27 chebyshev nodes in @xmath4d , followed by svd compression to further reduce the rank .",
    "the compression of the fill - ins is obtained using a tweaked version of the adaptive cross approximation algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the tolerance used to compress all the blocks is @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 was taken as @xmath30 .    as seen from all the benchmarks , it is important to note that the rank of the compressed blocks for the ifmm remains independent of @xmath13 , whereas for the hodlr solver the rank scales up ( roughly like @xmath31 ) with @xmath13 .",

    "@xmath33 .    @xmath34 .",
    "the article proposes the  inverse fast multipole method \" .",
    "the ifmm is a fast direct solver that the solver works on the same data structure as the fast multipole method and relies on compressing only the interactions corresponding to well - separated clusters .",
    "the highlight of the solver is that the computational cost scales linearly in the number of unknowns in all dimensions , provided the interactions corresponding to the well - separated clusters at all stages in the algorithm can be efficiently represented as a low - rank matrix .",
    "numerical benchmarks presented validate the @xmath7 scaling of the algorithm for the kernels considered .",
    "the ifmm can be extended to integral equations , where the resulting linear system obtained after discretization can be solved at a computational complexity of @xmath7 .",
    "it is also important to note that the ifmm can be applied to elliptic pdes when discretized using local finite difference or fine element methods . in this case",
    ", the ifmm will operate on a sparse matrix , which is a special case of a hierarchical matrix with the rank corresponding to well - separated clusters being zero .",
