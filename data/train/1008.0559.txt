    "it is well known that there are only two central force laws for which all bounded orbits are closed.@xcite by `` closed , '' we mean that the orbiting object returns to the same spatial location with the same velocity in a finite amount of time ( specifically , it returns to the same location in phase space ) . by `` bounded , '' we mean that the distance @xmath0 between the orbiting object and the central object always remains between two fixed values , @xmath1 , called the radial turning points , or in the case of elliptical orbits they are called periapsis and apoapsis .",
    "this result is known as bertrand s theorem,@xcite first obtained in 1873 .    if the attractive force is represented by a power law , @xmath2 , then only @xmath3 ( an inverse square force given by newton s law of gravitation or coulomb s law ) and @xmath4 ( a spring - like force given by hooke s law ) admit closed orbits , both of which happen to be elliptical .",
    "in fact , the orbits in these two potentials satisfy the additional criterion that they are `` non - crossing . ''",
    "a bounded orbit does not cross itself in configuration space if the ratio of its orbital period , @xmath5 , to the period of its radial oscillations , @xmath6 , is an integer . here",
    ", we use the parameter @xmath7 to denote this ratio . in the case of newtonian gravity @xmath8 , which means that there is only one periapsis and",
    "one apoapsis per orbit , and the central body resides at one focus of the elliptical orbit . in the case of hooke s law , however , @xmath9 , and the central body is located at the center of the elliptical orbit .",
    "this means that there are _ four _ turning points ( two close , two far ) in each orbit .",
    "the implications of bertrand s theorem have been investigated extensively , ranging from the symmetries inherent in the potentials to the deep connections between classical and quantum mechanics that it reveals.@xcite the fact that an orbit is closed means that , besides energy and angular momentum , there must be an additional conserved quantity  the runge - lenz vector.@xcite also , closely related to the fact that only @xmath10 and @xmath11 admit closed classical orbits is the result that these two potentials result in an exactly solvable schrodinger equation.@xcite in addition , these two potentials are `` dual '' in the sense that one problem can be obtained from the other by a change of variable.@xcite in addition , many authors have obtained proofs of the theorem that are more elegant and pedagogical than the original,@xcite and central potentials other than power - law have been investigated.@xcite    in this work we focus on analytical methods suitable for the intermediate mechanics student , as well as numerical techniques that can be used to find closed orbits ( especially those with interesting shapes ) in central forces other than inverse square or hooke s law .",
    "the types of closed orbits that can be obtained are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : classify ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : brownbertrand ] , bertrand s proof of his eponymous theorem is briefly outlined , and a more pedagogical proof , first given by brown,@xcite is covered in detail . this detail",
    "is needed because brown s method includes the mathematical insight necessary to analyze large amplitude perturbations from stable circular orbits . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : finitepert ] we obtain conditions that must be satisfied so that these large - amplitude orbits are closed , and several representative trajectories are obtained numerically .",
    "for all power law central forces other than inverse - square and hooke s law , most orbits , while they may remain bounded , are not closed . however , there are three cases in which the orbits _ are _ closed .",
    "first , as long as @xmath12 , all power law central forces exhibit a stable , closed , circular orbit at the radial location @xmath13 where the effective force @xmath14 is zero @xmath15 where the second term is the `` centrifugal force , '' @xmath16 is the ( constant ) angular momentum , and @xmath17 is the mass of the orbiting object .",
    "this stable radial location is given by @xmath18 .",
    "of course , if @xmath19 there are no stable circular orbits . indeed , when @xmath20 , newton showed that the trajectory is a so - called cotes spiral.@xcite    any deviation from a circular trajectory allows the possibility that the orbit may no longer be closed .",
    "however , the second case in which closed orbits arise is when the orbiting object is perturbed only slightly from the stable circular orbit .",
    "if @xmath0 is infinitesimally close to @xmath13 , then the effective potential energy ( defined as usual by @xmath21 ) can be expanded about @xmath13 @xmath22 where the effective spring constant is @xmath23 two types of periodic motion are now superposed , the previous orbital motion as well as a radial oscillation in the simple - harmonic effective potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ueff ] ) .",
    "the period of these radial oscillations is @xmath24 . since the orbital period , obtained by taking a ratio of the circumference , @xmath25 , to the orbital velocity , @xmath26 , is given by @xmath27 , the ratio of the two periods is@xcite @xmath28 if @xmath29 is such that @xmath30 is a rational fraction , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are integers , then this `` almost - circular '' orbit will be closed .",
    "hence , for certain forms of the power law that satisfy @xmath34 orbits that are only slightly perturbed from a circular orbit are closed .",
    "bertrand@xcite was able to show that in two special cases , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , orbits with large ( not just infinitesimal ) deviations from a circular trajectory remain closed .",
    "this analysis suggests that other solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdasmall ] ) , e.g. , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , admit closed orbits for infinitesimal perturbations from a circular orbit . however , we show in sec .  [",
    "sec : finitepert ] that for _ all _ values of @xmath29 that exhibit stable circular orbits , _ finite _ perturbations from a circular orbit can result in values of @xmath41 that are rational fractions .",
    "this is the third case , mentioned above , in which the orbits are closed.in this situation , most of the energy - angular momentum parameter space results in non closed orbits , but certain discrete values of these two parameters result in closed orbits .",
    "further , most of these are `` crossing '' orbits in which the trajectory crosses itself one or more times before returning to the original location , which means that they correspond to a rational fraction where @xmath42 .",
    "there are a few instances in which @xmath41 is an integer , though , and these orbits can be triangular ( @xmath43 ) or even square ( @xmath44 ) in shape .",
    "these large values of @xmath41 , however , require large positive values of @xmath29 .",
    "of course , the previous conclusions , as well as the analysis below , are not limited to power law central forces .",

    "this distribution turns out to be a good approximation for elliptical galaxies and dark matter haloes .",
    "the focus in these studies has been on understanding how the orbits affect the dynamics of the system , and not on whether each individual orbit is closed or not .",

    "( [ eq : betalambdaplus3 ] ) above , and therefore obtain orbital resonance conditions that can assist understanding galactic dynamics , such as bars in spiral galaxies .",

    "then a small radial impulse is imparted to the object ( in order to conserve the angular momentum @xmath16 ) which results in a nonzero radial velocity @xmath65 .",
    "of course , the subsequent trajectory consists of a harmonic oscillation of the radial coordinate , @xmath0 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is just the frequency of small radial oscillations , as we obtained above , and @xmath68 is the amplitude of the radial oscillations . there is a simple relation between the initial radial velocity @xmath65 and the amplitude @xmath68 , which is @xmath69 , or @xmath70 and which comes from elementary simple - harmonic - motion theory.@xcite    bertrand s theorem , however , is a statement about the character of _ finite _ radial oscillations , and the restriction to infinitesimal amplitudes must therefore be relaxed .",

    "this fact was already clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : brownresult ] ) .",
    "as @xmath65 increases from zero , @xmath41 will take on a continuum of real values less than 3 , most of which will not be rational .",

    "then , closed orbits can be found when the trajectory returns to the same phase space location after an integral number of orbits .",

    "therefore 20 crossings of the positive @xmath113 axis , the trajectory returns to the same phase space location .",
    "this confirms that the orbit is closed .",
    "in fact , the trajectory can be followed for several `` recurrence periods , '' i.e. , 40 or 60 orbits , to make sure that the poincar section is periodic in the long term .",
    "in addition to confirming that the orbit is closed , the surface of section suggests a technique that works for the second method : root finding _ via _ the shooting method.@xcite here , the shooting method works in the standard way , by casting the problem as a two - point boundary value problem .",
    "the initial condition is varied  in this case @xmath65 ( the other three initial conditions , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath86 , remain fixed )  and the equation of motion is integrated until the desired final condition is obtained .",
    "the final condition here is that for an orbit with @xmath117 , the distance in phase space between the `` zeroth '' crossing of the positive @xmath113 axis and the @xmath33th crossing be zero , i.e. , they must be identical . of course ,",
    "a good initial guess for @xmath65 is needed , and this is supplied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : browninvert ] ) .",
    "in addition , a robust root - finding method must be employed .",
    "since the derivative of our `` function '' ( distance in phase space as a function of @xmath65 ) is not available analytically , and since the tolerance of the root - finding method should not exceed the tolerance of the numerical integration , the simple secant method should work fine . on the other hand , since the phase space distance is a positive definite quantity , the desired distance is not just a root , but also a minimum .",
    "for this reason , a minimization method , such as brent s method,@xcite can also be used .",
