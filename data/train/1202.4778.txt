    "twisted gromov - witten invariants have been introduced in @xcite for manifold target spaces and extended by @xcite to the case of orbifolds .",
    "the original motivation was to express gromov - witten invariants of complete intersections ( the `` twisted '' ones ) in terms of the gw invariants of the ambient space ( the untwisted ones ) .",

    "the main tool in the computations is the grothendieck - riemann - roch theorem for stacks of @xcite , applied to the morphism @xmath5 : this gives differential equations satisfied by the generating functions of the twisted gw invariants . to the gromov - witten potential of an orbifold @xmath0",

    "we denote the moduli spaces of degree @xmath8 maps of genus @xmath9 with @xmath10 marked points by @xmath2 .    just like in the case of manifold target spaces , there are evaluation maps @xmath11 at the marked points .",
    "although it is clear how these maps are defined on geometric points , it turns out that to have well - defined morphisms of deligne - mumford stacks the target of the evaluation maps is the rigidified inertia stack of @xmath0 .",
