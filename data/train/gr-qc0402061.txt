    "the asymptotically flat schwarzschild spacetime is well - known @xcite to have a thermal instability : the hawking temperature for a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 which implies that the specific heat @xmath2 the instability is attributed , within a standard canonical ensemble approach , to the superexponential growth of the density of states @xmath3 which results in the canonical partition function diverging for large @xmath0 .",
    "the problems with an approach based on an equilibrium canonical ensemble do not exist , at least for isolated spherically symmetric black holes , formulated as _ isolated horizons _",
    "@xcite of fixed horizon area ; these can be consistently described in terms of an equilibrium _ microcanonical _ ensemble with fixed @xmath4 ( and hence disallowing thermal fluctuations of the energy @xmath0 ) . for @xmath5 , it has been shown using loop quantum gravity @xcite , that all spherically symmetric four dimensional isolated horizons possess a microcanonical entropy obeying the bekenstein - hawking area law ( bhal ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "further , the microcanonical entropy has corrections to the bhal due to quantum spacetime fluctuations at fixed horizon area . these arise , in the limit of large @xmath4 , as an infinite series in inverse powers of horizon area beginning with a term logarithmic in the area @xcite , with completely finite coefficients , @xmath6 where @xmath7    on the other hand , asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes with spherical symmetry are known @xcite to be describable in terms of an equilibrium canonical ensemble , so long as the cosmological constant is large in magnitude .",
    "for this range of black hole parameters , to leading order in @xmath8 the canonical entropy obeys the bhal . as the magnitude of the cosmological constant",
    "is reduced , one approaches the so - called hawking - page phase transition to a ` phase ' which exhibits the same thermal instability as mentioned above .    in this talk , we focus on the following    * is an understanding of the foregoing features of black hole entropy on some sort of a ` unified ' basis possible ?",
    "we shall argue , following @xcite that it is indeed so , with some rather general assumptions . * in addition to corrections ( to the area law ) due to fixed area quantum spacetime fluctuations computed using a microcanonical approach , can one compute corrections due to _ thermal _ fluctuations of horizon area within the canonical ensemble ? once again",
    ", the answer is in the affirmative with some caveats .",
    "the result found in @xcite , at least for the leading @xmath9 corrections , turns out to be _",
    "universal _ in the sense that , just like the bhal , it holds for all black holes independent of their parameters .",
    "following @xcite , we start with the canonical partition function in the quantum case @xmath10 recall that in classical general relativity in the hamiltonian formulation , the bulk hamiltonian is a first class constraint , so that the entire hamiltonian consists of the boundary contribution @xmath11 on the constraint surface . in the quantum domain , the hamiltonian operator can be written as @xmath12 with the subscripts @xmath13 and @xmath14 signifying bulk and boundary terms respectively . the hamiltonian constraint is then implemented by requiring @xmath15 for every physical state @xmath16 in the bulk .",
    "choose as basis for the hamiltonian in ( [ deco ] ) the state @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that the partition function may be factorized as @xmath18 thus , the relevance of the bulk physics seems rather limited due to the constraint ( [ hcon ] ) .",
    "the partition function further reduces to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the space of bulk states @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the ` boundary ' partition function given by @xmath23 since we are considering situations where , in addition to the boundary at asymptopia , there is also an inner boundary at the black hole horizon , quantum fluctuations of this boundary lead to black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the factorization in eq.([redp ] ) manifests in the canonical entropy as the appearance of an additive constant proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "since thermodynamic entropy is defined only upto an additive constant , we may argue that the bulk states do not play any role in black hole thermodynamics .",
    "this may be thought of as the origin of a weaker version of the holographic hypothesis @xcite .    for our purpose",
    ", it is more convenient to rewrite ( [ zs ] ) as @xmath25 where , we have made the assumptions that ( a ) the energy is a function of the area of the horizon @xmath8 and ( b ) this area is quantized . the first assumption ( a ) basically originates in the idea in the last paragraph of that black hole thermodynamics ensues solely from the boundary states whose energy ought to be a function of some property of the boundary like area . the second assumption ( b )",
    "is actually explicitly provable in theories like ncqgr as we now briefly digress to explain .",
    "the basic canonical degrees of freedom in ncqgr are holonomies of a distributional @xmath26 connection and fluxes of the densitized triad conjugate to this connection .",
    "the gauss law ( local @xmath26 invariance ) and momentum ( spatial diffeomorphism ) constraints are realized as self - adjoint operators constructed out of these variables .",
    "states annihilated by these constraint operators span the kinematical hilbert space .",
    "particularly convenient bases for this kinematical hilbert space are the spin network bases . in any of these bases ,",
    "a ( ` spinet ' ) state is described in terms of _ links _ @xmath27 carrying spins ( @xmath26 irreducible representations ) @xmath28 and _ vertices _ carrying invariant @xmath26 tensors ( ` intertwiners ' ) .",
    "spacetime curvature has support only on network .",
    "a particularly important property of such bases is that geometrical observables like area operator is diagonal in this basis with _ discrete spectrum_. an internal boundary of a spacetime like a horizon appears in this kinematical description as a punctured @xmath29 with each puncture having a deficit angle @xmath30 , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "1 _ internal boundary ( horizon ) pierced by spinet links _    for macroscopically large boundary areas @xmath5 , the area spectrum is dominated by @xmath31 .",
    "this is the situation when the deficit angles at each puncture takes its smallest nontrivial value , so that a classical horizon emerges .",
    "that implies that @xmath32 this completes our digression on ncqgr .",
    "going back to eq .",
    "( [ zss ] ) , we can now rewrite the partition function as an integral , using the poisson resummation formula @xmath33 for macroscopically large horizon areas @xmath34 , @xmath35 , so that the summation on the _ rhs _ of ( [ poi ] ) is dominated by the contribution of the @xmath36 term . in this approximation",
    ", we have @xmath37 \\label{appr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 .",
    "now , in equilibrium statistical mechanics , there is an inherent ambiguity in the definition of the microcanonical entropy , since it may also be defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the density of states .",
    "the relation between these two definitions involves the ` jacobian ' factor @xmath41 @xmath42 clearly , this ambiguity is irrelevant if all one is interested in is the leading order bhal .",
    "however , if one is interested in logarithmic corrections to bhal as we are , this difference is crucial and must be taken into account .",
    "we next proceed to evaluate the partition function in eq .",
    "( [ appr ] ) using the saddle point approximation around the point @xmath43 where @xmath0 is to be identified with the ( classical ) mass of the boundary ( horizon ) . integrating over the gaussian fluctuations around the saddle point , and dropping higher order terms , we get , @xmath44 \\ } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\cdot & \\left [ { \\pi \\over -s_{mc}''(m ) } \\right]^{1/2}~. \\label{spa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath45 , we obtain for the canonical entropy @xmath46 @xmath47 where , @xmath48 eq .",
    "( [ scan ] ) exhibits the equivalence of the microcanonical and canonical entropies , exactly as one expects when thermal fluctuation corrections are ignored .",
    "a few elementary manipulations on ( [ delta ] ) yield @xmath49~\\left({d{\\cal a } \\over dx}\\right)^2|_{e = m}~. \\label{delt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we observe that the microcanonical entropy obeys the bhal _ universally _ , i.e. , independent of the horizon parameters , and may even have universal logarithmic corrections in the horizon area .",
    "however , the factors in the _ rhs _ of ( [ delt ] ) underbraced ` non - univ . '",
    "depend explicitly on the area dependence of the energy and is hence a function of the horizon parameters .",
    "we now make the following assumptions    * assume @xmath50 * assume @xmath51    recall also that @xmath52 .",
    "substitution in eq .",
    "( [ delt ] ) now leads to the following simple formula @xmath53 the thermal fluctuation correction to the canonical entropy of a spacetime with an inner boundary is * universal * , independent of @xmath54 ; it is also insensitive ( for large areas ) to the log(area ) corrections in the microcanonical entropy due to quantum spacetime fluctuations .",
    "we note en passant that the contribution due to @xmath55 was first included in the canonical ensemble in ref .",
    "@xcite , although not on the grounds we have included it in this paper . an earlier paper by us @xcite which delineated the contribution of fixed - area quantum spacetime fluctuations to the bhal as distinct from thermal fluctuation effects missed out this ` jacobian ' term .",
    "similar is the case with ref.@xcite which also used the saddle point approximation to express the microcanonical entropy in terms of the canonical entropy . in terms of @xmath46 , as in @xcite , may be technically advantageous on occasion , but conceptually difficult to comprehend , since the former excludes all energy fluctuations which the latter incorporates .",
    "thus , when @xmath56 is expressed in terms of @xmath46 , the @xmath57 correction we have found merely cancels an equal and opposite term in @xmath46 in the treatment of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is hard to conclude from this treatment the fact that asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes , with fixed horizon area , can well be in equilibrium within a _ microcanonical _ ensemble . ]",
    "rcalling that there is at least ` circumstantial ' evidence that the microcanonical entropy has a ` universal ' form @xcite-@xcite , identical to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite quoted in eq .",
    "( [ smc ] ) , the total canonical entropy , including both the ` finite - size ' logarithmic corrections due to quantum spacetime fluctuations and the thermal energy ( area ) fluctuations , is given by @xmath58 clearly , the nature of the quantum and thermal fluctuations corrections preseves the desired property of superadditivity for the canonical entropy .",
    "two remarks are in order at this point : first of all , the form of the @xmath56 quoted in eq .",
    "( [ smc ] ) arises from the assumption that the residual gauge subgroup of local lorentz ( @xmath59 invariance , which survives on the cauchy slice of the isolated horizon , is assumed to be @xmath26 .",
    "the log correction found in @xcite originates from counting the boundary states of an @xmath26 chern simons theory , where the boundary has the topology of a punctured @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the boundary conditions appropriate to a non - rotating isolated horizon leave only a compact @xmath61 subgroup of this @xmath26 on the cauchy slice of the isolated horizon .",
    "if so , the @xmath62 in ( [ smc ] ) is replaced by @xmath63 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and consequently there is _ no _",
    "log(area ) correction to the canonical entropy , as the thermal fluctuation correction precisely cancels the quantum spacetime fluctuation correction .",
    "this is reminiscent of the phenomenon of ` non - renormalization ' that often occurs in certain quantum field theories .",
    "this cancellation is universal in the sense that it should hold for all non - rotating isolated horizons and presumably for rotating ones as well .",
    "the second remark pertains to the role of the index @xmath64 appearing in the assumption regarding the power law relation between the boundary energy and boundary area .",
    "observe that the area dependence of the correction term is quite independent of @xmath64 . however .",
    "@xmath64 has a crucial role to play : it determines the range of validity of the saddle point approximation used to evaluate @xmath65 . for @xmath66 , both @xmath46 and",
    "the canonical gibbs free energy remain real , implying that the saddle point has been correctly found . for @xmath67 , however , both the canonical entropy and the free energy acquire an imaginary piece , signifying a _ breakdown _ of the saddle point approximation . forcing the saddle point at the value",
    "@xmath0 implies that this is a point of _ unstable _ equilibrium .",
    "thus , for example , using the formulas worked out in @xcite , @xcite , we obtain    * @xmath68 for the non - rotating 2 + 1 dimensional btz black hole so long as the horizon radius @xmath69 , signifying the validity of the calculation in this case ; * @xmath70 for the four dimensional ads schwarzschild black hole , also indicating that the formula is reliable for this case in the same range of @xmath71 .",
    "but , * @xmath72 for the four dimensional asymptotically flat schwarzschild black hole , delineating the thermal instability mentioned at the very outset .",
    "the thermal instability for @xmath67 is generic for _ all _ asymptotically flat ( and also ds ) black holes at large area , including the extremal limits . on the other hand , for the ads black holes ,",
    "so long as one stays away from the hawking - page phase transition to the ads gas phase , there is no thermal instability @xcite .",
    "the canonical entropy of gravitating systems with horizons has a universal correction to the area law due to thermal fluctuations , in the form of @xmath73 , provided certain very general assumptions are made about the relation between the energy and the area of the boundary . within these assumptions ,",
    "asymptotically flat black holes display an unstable thermal equilibrium exactly as expected on general grounds .",
    "inclusion of the finite - size quantum corrections , in a microcanonical ensemble corresponding to fixed boundary area , leads either to a net logarithmic correction to the area law for canonical entropy obeying superadditivity , if the gauge group on the boundary is @xmath26 , or to _ no _ net logarithmic correction at all , if the gauge group is compact @xmath61 .    at the top of the agenda for future work , then , is the investigation of the assumptions made , within the framework a theory of quantum gravitation like ncqgr .",
    "one expects to have a better understanding of the thermal instability encountered for asymptotically flat ( and also ds ) black holes form such an exploration .",
