    "the inverse aspect ratio is is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the minor radius of a tokamak and @xmath12 is its major radius .",
    "a `` flux '' function @xmath13 is defined as the sum of the terms in square brackets in equation ( [ eq : wave_equation ] ) @xcite .",
    "this second order differential equation is decomposed into a pair of coupled differential equations in which the derivative of each of the two variables @xmath3 and @xmath13 can be expressed as a linear function of the other . at resonances ,",
    "the definition for @xmath13 becomes non - invertible , though a frobenius expansion reveals that @xmath13 remains finite at this point .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath13 at the resonance can be used to calculate the discontinuity in @xmath3 at that point .",

    "unfortunately , the addition of the resistive term increases the order of the differential equation that must be solved .",
    "hence , applying this resistive technique is relatively computationally intensive .",
    "use of the resistive method requires that resistivity be sufficiently large that at least two discretised continuum modes are excited @xcite and that the resistive contribution to the damping is negligible except near the resonance .",

    "the causality condition specifies which side of the poles the contour must lie on , similar to the case of landau damping @xcite .",
    "this condition implies that all poles due to resonances must be between the complex contour and the real axis .",
    "other poles , which are not physically meaningful , may result from the analytic continuation of equilibrium quantities .",
    "the contour must also remain on the same side of these as the real axis to avoid spurious contributions to the eigenmode and eigenfrequency . providing that these conditions are met , @xmath18 will be independent of the contour used .",

    "this suggests a damping ratio of between @xmath98 and @xmath99 , significantly smaller than the resistive estimate .",
    "however , further increasing the resolution to @xmath100 and then @xmath101 grid points results in a rapid increase in the calculated damping ratio . in comparison ,",
    "the real part of the tae  frequency computed by nova  converges to @xmath102 for @xmath94 radial grid points , agreeing closely with the resistive calculation using cka  ( to within @xmath103 ) .",
    "the mode structure also converges and is in close agreement with cka except in the region near the resonance .",
    "a sharp peak is observed at the resonance , with its size generally increasing with estimated damping .",
    "the wave functions are not symmetrical about the singularity in the region surrounding the peak , contrary to the logarithmic form of the singularity indicated by a frobenius expansion .",
    "this results in an erroneus discontinuity in the wave function at the singularity .",
    "the convergence of the perturbative continuum damping estimate with respect to radial grid resolution has been investigated for several additional cases . using nova taes  were found for various different values of @xmath0 and different @xmath32 and @xmath104 profiles .",
    "the effect of clustering radial grid points near the resonance was also examined . in each case",
    "the continuum damping estimate did not satisfactorily converge with radial grid resolution .",
    "indeed , it was found that addition of a single additional grid point could sometimes dramatically change the continuum damping calculated .",
    "the failure of the continuum damping estimate of nova  to converge appears to be due to the failure of the ideal mhd  code to properly incorporate the singularity due to the resonance .",
    "nova  represents the wave function using a linear combination of b - spline functions .",
    "splines are piecewise polynomials of order @xmath0 which are differentiable to order @xmath105 at interior points .",
    "b - splines have the distinction of having minimal support@xcite , simplifying the matrix eigenvalue problem by minimising the number of non - zero elements encountered .",
    "polynomial functions can not accurately represent the logarithmic singularity of the tae  at the resonance . in an abstract sense ,",
    "the tae  solution found using a finite element is a projection of the exact solution onto the solution space spanned by this basis set .",
    "when the bilinear form operates on the difference between the exact and finite element solutions and any element of the basis set , the result is zero , a condition referred to as galerkin orthogonality .",
    "therefore , the location of the radial grid points around the singularity , which determines the basis functions , significantly affects the tae  solution obtained in this region .",
    "this means that it is not possible to accurately or consistently compute the damping using the perturbative approach , which relies on the value of the tae  flux function at the resonance .",
    "this problem would be encountered by any finite element implementation of the perturbative method which does not use appropriate singular finite elements to represent the function near resonances . as the radial grid resolution",
    "is increased , the logarithmic singularity is not resolved .",
    "the piecewise polynomial basis functions can not accurately represent the singular wave function in a region encompassing the grid points nearest to the resonance .",
    "this leads to a grid - dependent jump in the wave function across the resonance",
    ". this jump does not decay with increasing grid resolution , despite the reduction in the region where the logarithmic behaviour is poorly represented .",
    "this is because dilation of a logarithmic function , @xmath106 , with respect to the variable @xmath107 merely corresponds to a translation in the function .",
    "a potential solution to the convergence issue would be to use a singular finite element to represent the singularity at this point .",
    "another method would be to accurately determine the location of the resonance and ensure that nearby grid points are spaced symmetrically around it .",
    "each of these methods would require foreknowledge of the location of the continuum resonance , which is itself dependent upon the tae  frequency .",
    "while such measures may improve convergence , they do not address the inaccuracy inherent in the perturbative technique identified in section [ sec : perturbative_vs_contour ] .",
    "moreover , such modifications are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "although a large number of harmonics are included in these calculations , it was found that the dominant components of the tae  were the @xmath108 and @xmath78 harmonics , as expected .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that considering additional modes significantly alters the damping calculated .",
    "this was supported by the observation that adding additional modes to the simplified perturbative tae  calculation of the previous section does not significantly alter the frequency , damping or structure of the mode .",

    "the perturbative technique examined can provide a qualitative understanding of how continuum resonance damping varies with equilibrium parameters .",
    "however , the magnitude of damping calculated by the perturbative technique generally has a significant error with respect to the accepted value .",
    "this is found even for cases with simplified geometry and very small damping .",
    "the observed discrepancy results from violation of the assumption in the perturbative method that the flux function @xmath13 does not change significantly due to the inclusion of the discontinuity at the resonance .",
    "moreover , the perturbative method has inherently poor convergence when applied to ideal mhd  finite element codes without appropriate singular basis functions .",
