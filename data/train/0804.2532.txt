    "in rayleigh - bnard convection , fluid confined in a box is heated from below and cooled on top .",
    "when the temperature difference is large enough , convective motion sets in .",
    "the flow state is characterized by the geometry of the box and two control parameters : the rayleigh number ( ra ) , which measures the strength of the thermal forcing and the prandtl number ( pr ) , which is the ratio of the diffusivities of momentum and heat of the fluid .",
    "the two parameters are defined by ra @xmath3 , and pr @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the temperature difference , @xmath6 is the height of the box , @xmath7 the acceleration due to gravity , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are respectively the volume expansion coefficient , kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity of the fluid .",
    "when ra is sufficiently large , the convective motion becomes turbulent .",
    "turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection has been a system of great research interest  ( see , for example ,  @xcite for a review ) . in particular ,",
    "an interesting question is how the heat transport of the fluid , measured by the nusselt number ( nu ) , which is defined as the actual heat transport normalized by that when there were only pure conduction , depends on ra in the limit of very high ra .",
    "more than 40 years ago , kraichnan predicted  @xcite that in this asymptotic limit , @xmath11 for pr @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 . here",
    "re@xmath15 is the reynolds number measuring the root - mean - squared horizontal velocity fluctuations @xmath16 at mid - height @xmath17 .",
    "such a scaling behavior of nu @xmath0 ra@xmath1 and re@xmath18  @xmath0ra@xmath1 is taken to be a signature of the so - called ultimate state of turbulent convection .",
    "this predicted asymptotic increase of nu as ra@xmath1 is stronger than the observed dependence of ra@xmath19 with @xmath20 around 0.3 at moderate ra . according to kraichnan ,",
    "the convective eddies , produced in the bulk of the turbulent convective flow , generate turbulent shear boundary layers near the walls and it is the small - scale turbulence present in these boundary layers that dominates and enhances the heat transport .",
    "thus , the shear boundary layers play a crucial role in giving rise to the ultimate - state scaling in kraichnan s work .    on the other hand , a recent theory proposed by grossmann and lohse  @xcite agrued that the kinetic and thermal boundary layers would either break down or do not contribute to the energy and thermal dissipation and",
    "thus do not play any role in the heat transport at very high ra . in this bulk - dominated state ,",
    "the grossmann - lohse ( gl ) theory predicted that for fluids with moderate pr : @xmath21 where re@xmath22 is the reynolds number measuring the mean large - scale circulating flow velocity @xmath23 near the boundaries .",
    "thus gl predicted the same scaling of ra@xmath1 for nu and re@xmath24 for fluids with moderate pr .",
    "the pr - dependence predicted in the gl theory agrees with that of kraichnan for pr @xmath25 but not for @xmath26 .",
    "we emphasize that although the predicted asymptotic dependence of nu and re@xmath24 or re@xmath18 are both ra@xmath1 in the two theories , the assumed roles of the boundary layers in heat transport in the asymptotic regime are rather different .    the ultimate state of turbulent convection has been elusive  @xcite in that definitive experimental evidence is lacking .",
    "an increase in the nu - ra scaling exponent was found around ra=@xmath27 by chavanne _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in experiments using low temperature helium gas , and was interpreted as the transition to the ultimate state .",
    "however , similar experiments by niemela",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the measurements of nu can be well represented by nu  @xmath0  ra@xmath28 for ra up to around @xmath29 .",
    "this puzzling discrepancy in the two experiments remains unresolved .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the increasing difficulty to keep the experiments within the boussinesq approximation at high ra  @xcite .",
    "gl s work led to the idea of attaining the ultimate - state scaling at moderate ra by an artificial destruction of the boundary layers  @xcite . by numerically simulating the bulk of turbulent rayleigh - bnard convective flow , modeled by three - dimensional homogeneous turbulent convection with periodic boundary conditions  @xcite , lohse and coauthors",
    "@xcite reported results that are consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ glbulknu ] ) and ( [ glbulkre ] ) , when re@xmath24 is replaced by the reynolds number measuring the root - mean - squared velocity fluctuations .",
    "it has been found that  @xcite . for three - dimensional homogeneous turbulent convection ,",
    "buoyancy is relevant only at the largest scales . on the other hand the bolgiano length  @xcite , which is",
    "an estimate of the length scale above which buoyancy forces are dominant , increases with ra at moderate ra .",
    "thus it is unclear whether or not buoyancy remains to be relevant only at the largest scales at very high ra .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the scaling of heat transport using a model for homogeneous turbulent convection in which buoyancy is acting directly on most of the scales . in this paper , we perform such a study using a shell model for homogeneous turbulent convection , and buoyancy is acting on most of the scales in some parameter range .",
    "we investigate the scaling behavior of nu and the reynolds number ( re ) measuring the root - mean - squared velocity fluctuations .",

    "homogeneous turbulent convection , which represents the bulk of turbulent rayleigh - bnard convection , has been proposed  @xcite as a three - dimensional convective flow in a box , with periodic boundary conditions , driven by a constant temperature gradient along the vertical direction . in boussinesq approximation",

    "moreover , buoyancy directly affects the statistics of the system such that the scaling behavior of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is given by the bolgiano - obukhov scaling  @xcite  ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) plus corrections rather than kolmogorov 1941 scaling  @xcite  ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) plus corrections . in other words",

    "<S> this suggests that if buoyancy acts on most of the scales in the bulk of turbulent convection at very high ra , then the ultimate state can not be a bulk - dominated state . </S>"
