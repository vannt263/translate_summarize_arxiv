    "the past decade has seen significant progress in our knowledge of the observational properties of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "from a timing point of view , the presence of binary companions has been practically ruled out @xcite , and subsequently their potential for great rotational stability was demonstrated @xcite , thereby allowing the discovery that axps can exhibit spin - up glitches @xcite , and large ( factor of @xmath210 ) torque variations @xcite . from a radiative point of view , axps are now known to show a variety of different variability phenomena , including long - lived flares @xcite , short sgr - like bursts @xcite , large outbursts ( @xcite ; tam et al . , submitted ) , and slow , low - level flux and pulse profile variability ( @xcite ; gonzalez et al . ,",
    "submitted ) .",
    "spectrally , though previously studied only in the soft x - ray band , axps are now seen in the radio band @xcite , through the mid- @xcite and near - ir ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the optical range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , up to hard x - ray energies @xcite .",
    "the evidence thus far argues strongly that axps , like their close cousins , the soft gamma repeaters , are magnetars ",
    "young , isolated neutron stars powered by a large magnetic energy reservoir , with surface fields of @xmath3  g @xcite .    in spite of this progress ,",
    "however , many aspects of axps remain mysterious . particularly so are their variability properties . what is the origin of the variety of different types of variability ?",
    "although bursts can be explained as sudden crustal yields , slower evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been suggested to be due to slow magnetospheric twists @xcite .",
    "some support for this picture has been argued to come from observed correlations between flux and spectral hardness @xcite , although @xcite argue that such a correlation need not originate uniquely from the magnetosphere and could be purely thermal .",
    "at least some radiative variability has been seen to be correlated with timing behavior .",
    "the best example of this occured in the 2002 outburst of axp 1e  2259 + 586 in which the pulsar suffered a large spin - up glitch apparently simultaneously with a major x - ray outburst @xcite . @xcite",
    "describe a similar radiative outburst in axp cxou j164710.2@xmath0455216 , and report a large contemporaneous glitch , as did @xcite recently for axp 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 .",
    "by contrast , axp rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  exhibited two glitches with no evidence for a corresponding radiative event @xcite although @xcite suggested possible low - level pulse profile changes associated with the second glitch .",
    "@xcite also suggested that observed flux and spectral changes may be associated with glitches and predicted a third glitch would be observed after mid-2005 on the basis of an observed flux increase and apparently correlated spectral changes .",
    "here we report on 8.7 and 7.6  yr of monitoring of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045 , respectively , using the proportional counter array ( pca ) aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "we report the discovery of one new glitch and three new glitch candidates in rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 as well as three new glitches in 1e  1841@xmath0045 , including one of the largest glitches , in terms of fractional frequency increase , thus far observed in any neutron star .",
    "we also present pulsed flux time series for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045  which reveal little or no evidence for correlated changes with glitches , although rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910shows low - level pulsed flux variability at many epochs .",
    "we also report a pulse profile evolution analysis which shows that both pulsars profiles are evolving slowly with time , though in neither case does this evolution show a clear correlation with timing behavior .",
    "these results demonstrate that axps rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045  are frequent glitchers . they also demonstrate that although axp timing glitches can occur simultaneously with significant long - lived radiative enhancements , they need not always do so .",
    "the results presented here were obtained using the pca on board _",
    "rxte_. the pca consists of an array of five collimated xenon / methane multi - anode proportional counter units ( pcus ) operating in the 2@xmath060 kev range , with a total effective area of approximately 6500  @xmath4 and a field of view of @xmath21@xmath5 fwhm @xcite .",
    "our 294 observations of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and our 136 observations of 1e  1841@xmath0045  are of various lengths ( see tables  [ tableobs1 ] and  [ tableobs2 ] ) . most were obtained over a period of several years as part of a long - term monitoring program , but some are isolated observations ( see figures  [ figureobs1 ] and  [ figureobs2 ] ) .    for the monitoring , we used the goodxenonwithpropane data mode except during cycles  10 and  11 when we used the goodxenon mode . both data modes record photon arrival times with 1-@xmath6s resolution and bin photon energies into one of 256 channels . to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we analysed only those events from the top xenon layer of each pcu .",
    "photon arrival times at each epoch were adjusted to the solar system barycenter .",
    "resulting arrival times were binned with 31.25-ms time resolution . in the rxs",
    "j170849.0@xmath0400910  timing analysis , we included only events in the energy range 2@xmath06  kev , to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the pulse .",
    "similarly , for 1e  1841@xmath0045  we included events in the energy range 2@xmath011  kev .",
    "each barycentric binned time series was folded using an ephemeris determined iteratively by maintaining phase coherence as we describe below . resulting pulse profiles , with 64 phase bins , were cross - correlated in the fourier domain with a high signal - to - noise template created by adding phase - aligned profiles from all observations .",
    "the cross - correlation returned an average pulse time of arrival ( toa ) for each observation corresponding to a fixed pulse phase .",
    "the pulse phase @xmath7 at any time @xmath8 can usually be expressed as a taylor expansion , @xmath9 where @xmath10  @xmath11  1/@xmath12 is the pulse frequency , @xmath13  @xmath11  @xmath14/@xmath15 , etc@xmath16 , and subscript `` 0 '' denotes a parameter evaluated at the reference epoch @xmath17 .",
    "the toas were fitted to the above polynomial using the pulsar timing software package tempo .",
    "note that we also searched for x - ray bursts in each 220  kev barycentered , binned time series using the methods described in @xcite , however no bursts were found in any of our rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  or 1e  1841@xmath0045  data sets .",
    "figure [ figure1708big ] and table  [ table1708big ] summarize our results for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 .",
    "the pulsar s spin evolution can be characterized by steady spin - down , punctuated by sudden episodes of spin - up , i.e. , glitches , in addition to candidate glitch events and apparently random noise .",
    "we provide in table  [ table1708big ] pulse ephemerides for inter - glitch ranges labelled as in the top panel of figure  [ figure1708big ] .",
    "residuals after subtraction of these models are shown in the next panel of figure  [ figure1708big ] .",
    "overall the models describe the data well .",
    "however , particularly when our timing precision was highest ( i.e. , before 2003 ) , some low - level but significant deviations are seen on time scales of weeks to months .",
    "their origin is unknown but is likely related to `` timing noise , '' commonly seen in other axps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ubiquitously in radio pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that @xcite performed simulations which showed that pulse profile changes similar to those observed in this source ( see  [ sec : profiles1708 ] ) did not result in timing offsets significantly larger than our reported toa uncertainties .",
    "hence , the features in the timing residuals reported here are not a result of pulse profile changes .",
    "in addition to the two previously reported glitches ( which we have reanalysed , finding results consistent with those already in the literature ; see @xcite ) , we have identified a third unambiguous glitch that occured near mjd 53551 ( 2005 june 30 ) .",
    "note that the exact glitch epoch is unknown due to our non - continuous monitoring ; we report an epoch for which the phase jump is zero .",
    "this is because a non - zero phase jump at the time of the glitch would suggest an unphysically large torque on the star .",
    "this third glitch had fractional frequency jump @xmath18 , and no obvious recovery .",
    "this glitch amplitude is intermediate between those of the previous two observed glitches , and the lack of recovery is similar to what was seen in the first glitch , but in marked contrast with the second glitch , as is clear from figure  [ figure1708glitches ] .",
    "a sudden change in post - glitch spin - down rate for the third glitch is difficult to constrain , because of a possible additional glitch that occured not long after , as we describe below .",
    "indeed glitch - induced long - term changes in @xmath13 aside from that following the first glitch , as described by @xcite , are difficult to identify given the apparent timing noise processes .",
    "table  [ table1708glitches ] summarizes the parameters of the three certain glitches of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , assuming a glitch model consisting of a permanent change in @xmath10 and @xmath13 and a frequency change @xmath19 that decayed on a time scale of @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the frequency evolution pre - glitch , @xmath23 is a instantaneous frequency jump , @xmath24 is the post - glitch frequency increase that decays exponentially on a time scale @xmath20 , @xmath25 is the glitch epoch , and @xmath26 is the post - glitch change in the long - term frequency derivative .    for the second glitch ,",
    "residuals after subtraction of a simple glitch with fractional exponential recovery have clear remaining trends , as is clear in figures [ figure1708big ] ( second panel ) and [ figure1708glitches ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "systematic trends after simple glitch model subtraction were also reported by @xcite for the 2002 glitch in 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "we also find this in the largest glitch in 1e  1841@xmath0045  ( see   [ sec : timing1841 ] ) .",
    "@xcite showed that for 1e  2259 + 586 , the glitch fit was significantly improved by adding an exponential growth term .",
    "we have tried fitting this model to the second glitch from rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  but find no improvement , with the preferred growth term consistent with zero .",
    "in addition to the new certain glitch we report above , we find strong evidence for an additional three glitches , each having fractional amplitude similar to the first certain glitch seen in this source .",
    "the properties of these candidate glitches are summarized in table  [ table1708cands ] .",
    "timing residuals around the epochs of these glitches are shown in figure  [ figure1708cands ] , in the top panel .",
    "residuals following the subtraction of a glitch model are shown in the middle panel of that figure .",
    "we refer to these as candidates only because a 4-th order polynomial fit to the same data results in similar residuals ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figure1708cands ] ; table  [ table1708alt ] ) without the need to invoke a sudden event .",
    "the distinction between true glitches and timing noise is often difficult to make for small - amplitude glitches , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "one way to distinguish , at least statistically , is that apparent discontinuities attributable to timing noise should not have a preferential direction , i.e. , apparent spin - down ` glitches ' should be seen too .",
    "an examination of the frequency panel in figure  [ figure1708big ] reveals apparent frequency jumps at the candidate glitch levels in both directions , suggesting one or more of the candidates could indeed be timing noise . continued monitoring to acquire a larger database of such apparent discontinuities will help clarify this issue .",
    "subsequent to our submission and posting of this paper , @xcite posted the results of a similar analysis of a subset of these same data .",
    "some of their results are consistent with ours however others differ .",
    "they reported two glitches , the first of which corresponds to our second candidate glitch ( table  [ table1708cands ] ) .",
    "for that glitch , the reported fit parameters are similar though not identical to ours .",
    "their second glitch corresponds to our third glitch in table  [ table1708glitches ] . for that glitch ,",
    "the reported frequency jump at the glitch epoch was similar to ours but the jump in frequency derivative was significantly different .",
    "we find that this difference is due to their inclusion of more post - glitch toas when fitting the glitch .",
    "we did not include these toas because of a candidate event that occurs shortly thereafter , but which israel et al .",
    "did not report .",
    "in addition to this difference , the frequency value reported in their post - glitch ephemeris , 0.09088624(2 )  hz , is 42@xmath27 away from the value 0.090885327(8 )  hz that we measure at the same epoch using our post - glitch ephemeris .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are 1@xmath27 uncertainties .",
    "we do not understand this difference .",
    "figure  [ figure1841big ] and table  [ table1841big ] summarize the long - term timing behavior of 1e  1841@xmath0045 . as for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910",
    ", the spin evolution of 1e  1841@xmath0045  is well characterized by regular spin - down punctuated by occasional sudden spin - up events , plus timing noise .",
    "ephemerides in table [ table1841big ] are given for the glitch - free intervals indicated in the top panel of figure  [ figure1841big ] .",
    "as for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , the long - term timing residuals show some unmodelled trends whose origin is unknown .",
    "we consider these trends timing noise , as did @xcite in their analysis of @xmath22  yr of data from this object .",
    "note that the ephemeris in table [ table1841big ] labeled b2 is the same as that labeled b except for the omission of data immediately post - glitch ( see caption to fig .",
    "[ figure1841big ] ) .",
    "the frequency panel in figure  [ figure1841big ] and first panel in figure  [ figure1841glitches ] make clear that 1e  1841@xmath0045  suffered a large glitch , with significant recovery , near mjd 52460 ( 2002 july 5 ) .",
    "this epoch is estimated , as for all glitches reported in this paper , by taking the epoch at which the phase jump is zero .",
    "note that for this glitch there were several such epochs and the one we are reporting gives the most conservative frequency jump assuming an exponential recovery .",
    "the least conservative possible frequency jump is @xmath2  50% larger .",
    "the glitch fractional amplitude was @xmath28 ( see table  [ table1841glitches ] ) , among the largest yet seen from any neutron star .",
    "a fraction @xmath29 of the glitch recovered on a time scale of 43  days .",
    "this glitch is thus similar to the second certain glitch seen in rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , and to the 2002 glitch in 1e  2259 + 586 , which also showed significant recoveries on time scales of weeks . also , like the second glitch of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , this large glitch in 1e  1841@xmath0045is not well modelled by equation  [ eq : glitch ] , as is clear in the residuals plot in figure  [ figure1841glitches ] . accompanying",
    "this frequency glitch was a substantial long - term increase in the the magnitude of @xmath13 , with fractional increase @xmath30 .",
    "this is discussed further in  [ sec : disc_glitch ] .",
    "because of the sparsity of the data around the glitch epoch , we found an alternate ephemeris for the period of time covered by ephemeris  b ( fig .  [ figure1841big ] , table  [ table1841big ] ) .",
    "the fit parameters are @xmath31  hz , @xmath32  hz  s@xmath33 , @xmath34  hz  s@xmath35 , and @xmath36  hz  s@xmath37 at the reported glitch epoch mjd 52464.00448 , with rms phase residual of 0.019 .",
    "this ephemeris disagrees with ephemeris b in the shape of the recovery ( see dotted curve in panel  3 of fig .",
    "[ figure1841big ] ) but agrees with it after the end of the recovery . using the parameters of this alternate ephemeris , the change in @xmath10 at the glitch epoch would be @xmath38  hz much smaller than the one reported in table  [ table1841glitches ] .",
    "however , we hesitate to interpret the glitch using this ephemeris because of the very unusual and unique shape of the recovery it predicts .",
    "note that this alternate ephemeris also shows a long - term increase in the magnitude of @xmath13 after the glitch .",
    "we also report the detection of two additional , smaller glitches , as summarized in table  [ table1841glitches ] and displayed in figures  [ figure1841big ] and [ figure1841glitches ] .",
    "neither glitch displays significant recovery , and both are well modelled by a simple permanent frequency jump .",
    "another interesting axp property we can study thanks to _ rxte _ monitoring is the evolution of the pulse profile .",
    "we performed a pulse profile analysis on each axp using ftools version 5.3.1 .",
    "we used the following steps : for each observation , we ran the ftool ` make_se ` to combine the goodxenon files .",
    "we then used the ftool ` fasebin ` to make a phase - resolved spectrum of the entire observation with 64 phase bins across the profile . when we ran ` fasebin ` , we selected layer  1 of the detector , disregarded the propane photons , and included the photons from pcus  1 ,  2 ,  3 , and  4 .",
    "we omitted pcu  0 , for which an independent analysis of axp 4u 0142 + 61 revealed spectral modeling irregularities @xcite . `",
    "fasebin ` also took care of barycentering the data . for each observation , we then used ` seextrct ` to make a phase - averaged spectrum for the same set of detector layers and pcus .",
    "the phase - averaged spectrum was then used by the perl script ` pcarsp ` to make a response matrix .",
    "we loaded the phase - resolved spectra and the response matrices into the x - ray spectral fitting package ( xspec ) and selected photons belonging to three energy bands : 2@xmath010 , 2@xmath04 , and  4@xmath010  kev . using xspec , we extracted a count - rate pulse profile for each of the energy bands .",
    "the profiles included xspec - obtained 1@xmath27 error bars on each of the phase bins . to obtain a pulse profile in units of count rate per pcu",
    ", we divided the overall profile by a pcu coverage factor that took into account the amount of time each pcu was on .",
    "we then aligned the 64-bin profiles with a high signal - to - noise template using a similar cross - correlation procedure to the one used in the timing analysis .",
    "then , for each glitch - free interval , we summed the aligned profiles , subtracted the dc component , and scaled the resulting profile so that the value of the highest bin is unity and the lowest point is zero .",
    "average profiles for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  in the three energy bands are presented in figure  [ figure1708profiles ] . in a given band ,",
    "the different profile qualities are due to different net exposure times .",
    "energy dependence is clearly visible to the eye as well as small fluctuations .",
    "for example , in the 24  kev band , the small peak off the main pulse has clearly fluctuating intensity .",
    "this small peak gets larger at higher energy , as seen in the 210  kev band . in the 410  kev band",
    ", the smaller peak seems to blend with the main low - energy peak to yield a broad single peak structure , although fluctuations in that structure are apparent .    to study these fluctuations quantitatively , we subjected each profile to a fourier analysis .",
    "figure  [ figure1708harm1 ] shows the evolution of the first three profile harmonics with time .",
    "although there are hints of variation in all energy bands , only variations in the hard 410  kev band are statistically significant ( as determined by the @xmath39 statistic from a fit to a constant value ) ; the decline of the second and third harmonics in the hard band have probabilities of 0.0007% and 0.0012% , respectively , of being due to chance .",
    "thus in the hard band the profile is certainly becoming more sinusoidal , in agreement with what is inferred by eye .",
    "the above analysis shows that the profile is changing , but not whether these changes are truly correlated with the glitch epochs , since changes could be occuring throughout . to search for pulse profile changes correlated with glitch epochs , as were claimed by @xcite ,",
    "we divided glitch - free intervals into several sub - intervals ( typically of duration @xmath230 days ) for which independent profiles were created .",
    "the number of sub - intervals was chosen by trading off signal - to - noise ratio for time resolution .",
    "these sub - interval profiles were then fourier analysed .",
    "the evolution of the fourier powers in the first three harmonics in the 210  kev profile are shown in the top panel of figure  [ figure1708harmonics ] .    to determine whether the apparent fluctuations are statistically significant",
    ", we fit a constant value to each time series and from the @xmath39 of the best fit , found that the probabilities of the fluctuations being due to random noise are 68 , 96 and 69% for @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "this analysis thus shows no evidence for profile changes associated with the glitch epochs , including the second glitch .",
    "however the reduced signal - to - noise ratios in the sub - interval average profiles , required for interesting time resolution , makes us insensitive to subtle profile changes . to search for glitch - correlated pulse profile changes in a different way , for each sub - interval we calculated the reduced @xmath39 of the difference between that sub - interval s average profile and the previous one .",
    "the time series of these @xmath39 values is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ figure1708harmonics ] .",
    "there is clearly no evidence for any profile change at the second glitch , or at the third certain glitch .",
    "there is some hint of profile changes at the first and second candidate glitches , however a k - s test shows that our @xmath39 values as a group have a probability of 39% of originating from @xmath39 distribution .",
    "interestingly though , the probability of the single high @xmath39 value we measure at the second candidate glitch occuring randomly is only @xmath41 ; that at the first glitch is 1.7% and at the first glitch candidate is 0.4% .",
    "thus we do find possible evidence in this analysis for glitch - correlated pulse profile changes , though the best evidence for significant changes occurs only at two candidate glitches , i.e. , the lowest amplitude events .",
    "summed profiles for 1e  1841@xmath0045  in three energy bands for the five glitch - free intervals defined in the top panel of figure  [ figure1841big ] are shown in figure  [ figure1841profiles ] . as for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , some low - level profile fluctuations are suggested , particularly in the relative amplitude of the leading and trailing sides of the large single peak in the 210 kev band ( though clearly this peak could also be considered the blend of two or more adjacent peaks ) .    as for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910",

[ figure1841big ] ) decreased , then slowly relaxed back to the previous range .",
    "however , a @xmath39 test shows the probability of this behavior being due to random noise is 18% , too large to exclude .    to look for pulse profile changes correlated with glitches , again",

    "the evolution of the first three harmonics is shown in the top panel of figure  [ figure1841harmonics ] .",
    "fluctuations are apparent although none is particularly remarkable at any of the glitch epochs , including the first and largest , and the time series for @xmath40 are all consistent with a constant value .",

    "_ rxte _ monitoring also allows the study of the evolution of the pulsed flux of these sources . to obtain a pulsed flux time series for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045",
    ", we did the following .",
    "first , for each observation , we used a procedure similar to that described in  [ sec : profiles ] to make a count rate per pcu pulse profile ( with 64 phase bins across the profile and excluding pcu  0 ) in the energy range 210  kev .",
    "the profiles included xspec - determined 1@xmath27 error bars on the flux value in each of the phase bins .",
    "the pulsed flux for each of the profiles was calculated using the following rms formula : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath44 even fourier component defined as @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the uncertainty of @xmath43 , @xmath47 is the odd @xmath44 fourier component defined as @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the uncertainty of @xmath47 , @xmath50 refers to the phase bin , @xmath51 is the total number of phase bins , @xmath52 is the count rate in the @xmath53 phase bin of the pulse profile , and @xmath54 is the maximum number of fourier harmonics to be taken into account .",
    "we used @xmath55 for both rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045 .",
    "our method for estimating the pulsed flux @xmath56 is equivalent to the simple rms formula @xmath57 ( where @xmath52 is the count rate in the @xmath53 phase bin of the pulse profile and @xmath58 is the average count rate ) , except that we have subtracted the variances ( to eliminate the upward statistical bias ) and only included the statistically significant fourier components . for a detailed discussion on pulsed flux estimates , see archibald , dib & kaspi ( in prep . ) .",
    "our pulsed flux time series for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  is shown in figure  [ figure1708big ] ( bottom panel ) and again in figure  [ figure1708flux ] .",
    "each data point represents the average of pulsed fluxes measured over @xmath21  month .",
    "there appear to be frequent low - level pulse flux variations in this source .",
    "although our error estimates on the pulsed fluxes include only statistical uncertainty ( i.e. , we have made no effort to estimate systematic uncertainties ) , we are given confidence that the fluctuations seen e.g. , near mjd 52000 are real , given how stable the pulsed flux of 1e  1841@xmath0045  is in the same time interval ( see  [ sec : flux1841 ] ) .",

    "the measured pulsed fluxes are consistent with being constant , with their probability of being due to random fluctuations 52% .",
    "there is no evidence for any pulsed flux change at the glitch epochs .",

    "we have now observed a sufficiently large sample of axp glitches that we can make meaningful phenomenological comparisons with glitches in radio pulsars , a much better studied phenomenon .",
    "detection of systematic differences in axp and radio pulsar glitch properties would be interesting as it could signal structural differences between magnetars and conventional radio pulsars .",
    "figure  [ fig : amp_dist ] shows the fractional and non - fractional amplitude distributions of radio pulsar and axp glitches . as is clear from the figure ,",
    "although the fractional glitch amplitudes of axps are generally large by radio pulsar standards , the axp absolute glitch amplitudes , more directly related to the angular momentum transfer during the glitch , are neither especially large nor especially small .",
    "thus , glitching in neutron stars is clearly not correlated with frequency as some studies of radio pulsars have suggested @xcite .",
    "given the spectacular radiative outburst contemporaneous with the large 2002 1e  2259 + 586 glitch , we can speculate that larger angular momentum transfers that occur in radio pulsars could result in even more dramatic outbursts in affected axps , possibly like those seen in xte  1810@xmath0197 @xcite and in the axp candidate ax j1845@xmath00258 @xcite .",

    "however the lack of any observed radiative change in 1e  1841@xmath0045  around the time of its first observed glitch , which was over a factor of two larger than that in 1e  2259 + 586 in terms of absolute frequency jump , argues against this idea .",
    "clearly , the data are indicating that axp glitches , even large ones , can be either radiatively loud or quiet .",

    "indeed @xmath65 for 1e  1841@xmath0045  is the highest glitch activity seen thus far in any neutron star , radio pulsar or axp , to our knowledge .",
    "we also calculated a tentative glitch activity for axp 1e  2259 + 586 , for which we have observed two glitches , the well documented one in 2002 @xcite and a second , smaller glitch that occured very recently and had fractional amplitude @xmath72 and no recovery ( dib et al . , in prep . ) .",

    "previous authors have noted interesting correlations on these plots for radio pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these are seen in our plots as well .",
    "note that upper limits for some radio pulsars of relevant ages fall well below the apparent correlations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we choose not to plot those because , as discussed in that reference , a single glitch of average size would bring them roughly in line with the correlation . note",
    "that the radio pulsar outlier at small age and high @xmath13 in all plots is the crab pulsar , long - known to exhibit few and small glitches .",
    "we also looked for a trend in a plot of @xmath63 or @xmath65 versus surface dipolar field ( as estimated via @xmath76  g ) but found none .    as a group ,",
    "the axps do not especially distinguish themselves when either activity , @xmath63 or @xmath65 is plotted versus spin - down age , though they do increase the scatter .",
    "this suggests a universal correlation with spin - down age .",

    "however , interestingly , the axps as a group all stand out on the diagram of @xmath63 versus @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : actage ] ) , such that for similar spin - down rates , their fractional glitch activities are much larger than in radio pulsars .",
    "@xcite argued that @xmath63 provides a strict lower limit on the fraction of the moment of inertia of the neutron star that resides in the angular momentum reservoir ( generally assumed to be the crustal superfluid ) tapped during spin - up glitches , @xmath77 .",
    "they showed that @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the moment of inertia of the crust and all components strongly coupled to it , and @xmath80 is a `` coupling parameter . '' for radio pulsars , they argued for a universal @xmath80 that implies @xmath81 .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether this same apparently universal relationship holds for axps .",
    "figure  [ fig : gage ] shows @xmath80 plotted versus age for radio pulsars and axps .",
    "as is clear , the @xcite relation seems to hold for the radio pulsars , even with increased glitch statistics . also , axps rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045  lie among the radio pulsars , suggesting similar reservoir fractions .",
    "however the outlier point , 1e  2259 + 586 , has @xmath82 , much larger than the others .",
    "admittedly , for this axp , @xmath63 is estimated from two glitches only , with the 2002 event greatly dominating , so the values are tentative .",
    "still , the large @xmath80 , if real , suggests that at least @xmath225% of the stellar moment of inertia is in the angular momentum reservoir ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the analysis of @xcite ignores recovery , important for the 2002 1e  2259 + 586 glitch , which dominates its @xmath63 .",
    "however in the 2002 glitch , the recovery fraction was only @xmath219% , so even accounting for recovery , @xmath80 for 1e  2259 + 586 is surprisingly high .    as described by @xcite and @xcite , the 2002 1e  2259 + 586 glitch was unusual when compared with those of radio pulsars .",
    "specifically the combination of the recovery time scale and the large recovery fraction @xmath66 conspired to make the pulsar spin down , for over two weeks post - glitch , at over twice its long - term average spin - down rate .",
    "although spin - down rate enhancements post - glitch are often seen in radio pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they usually amount to only a few percent .",
    "a remarkably large post - glitch spin - down rate enhancement was seen also in the second glitch of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and the first observed glitch of 1e  1841@xmath0045 , though to a lesser degree than in 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "of course a much larger increase in spin - down rate post - glitch in rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  or 1e  1841@xmath0045  could have been missed due to our sparse sampling .    one way to quantify the enhanced spin - down",
    "more precisely is using equation  [ eq : glitch ] at @xmath83 , and noticing that the instantaneous spin - down rate at the glitch epoch due to the exponential recovery is given by @xmath84 . comparing this quantity for the axp glitches that show recovery with the pre - glitch time - averaged spin - down rate @xmath13",
    ", we find that for 1e  2259 + 586 @xmath85 , @xmath86 for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , and @xmath87 for 1e  1841@xmath0045 , all very large by radio pulsar standards .    the increase in spin - down rate post - glitch , at least for radio pulsars ,",
    "is generally attributed to a decoupling of a small percentage of the moment of inertia of the star , usually presumed to be part of the crustal superfluid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with constant external torque .",
    "if the observed axp recoveries and temporarily enhanced spin - down rates were interpreted in the same way , it would imply that very large fractions ( ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 ) of the moment of inertia of the star decoupled at the glitch , much larger than the crustal superfluid is reasonably expected to comprise , for any interior equation of state . to avoid this problem , @xcite suggested that a pre - glitch rotational lag between the crust and superfluid might have temporarily reversed at the glitch ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "then the observed larger spin - down rate post - glitch would be due to the crust transferring angular momentum back to the superfluid in order to reestablish equilibrium .    in glitches , the equilibrium angular velocity lag between the crust and more rapidly rotating crustal superfluid",
    "is thought to be the origin of glitches .",
    "this lag is proposed to develop because the crustal superfluid s angular momentum vortices , in many models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , become pinned to crustal nuclei and hence are hindered from moving outward as the star s crust and associated components are slowed by the external torque .",
    "how this lag could reverse is puzzling .",
    "@xcite suggested that a twist of magnitude @xmath88  rad of a circular patch of crust offset in azimuth from the rotation axis could result in sufficient spin - down of the crustal superfluid to account for the properties of the 2002 glitch in 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "they noted further that such a twist also produces x - rays of the luminosity observed in that outburst @xcite .",
    "the absence of any significant radiative changes at the time of largest glitches in rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045  is thus problematic for the crustal twist , and hence lag reversal , model .",
    "we note that it has been argued independently that a similar suggested lag reversal between crust and crustal superfluid in the vela pulsar is unphysical @xcite .",
    "we also note that the large and long - term increase in the magnitude of @xmath13 following the large glitch in 1e  1841@xmath0045  ( see  [ sec : timing1841 ] ) is also interesting .",
    "@xcite showed that , ignoring transient terms , @xmath89 .",
    "for the large 1e  1841@xmath0045  glitch , this implies @xmath90 , much larger than has been seen in any radio pulsar .",
    "one possibility that can explain the large @xmath80 for 1e  2259 + 586 , the large transient increases in the magnitude of @xmath13 in all three large glitches , as well as the large extended @xmath13 change in the first 1e  1841@xmath0045  glitch , is that core superfluid is somehow involved , as it is expected to carry the bulk of the moment of inertia .",
    "we note that core glitches have been discussed in the radio pulsar context for some time , albeit for very different reasons .",
    "although @xcite argued that the crust and core should be strongly coupled on very short time scales , @xcite found that crustal pinning of superfluid vortices can not be occuring in neutron stars , because the maximum pinning force is orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated vortex magnus force .",
    "@xcite argue that crustal vortex pinning can not occur for independent reasons .",
    "if these authors are correct , pulsar glitches would generally not originate in the crust .    why would the clearest evidence for core glitches come from axps ?",
    "the interaction between vortices and quantized magnetic flux tubes in a core superfluid could provide resistance to outward motion of vortices @xcite .",
    "the interior magnetic field playing a role in vortex pinning as studied by @xcite could help explain why such unusual glitch recoveries are seen preferentially in axps , which appear to have much larger magnetic fields than conventional radio pulsars .",
    "perhaps the larger field , which implies a higher density of flux tubes , can effectively pin more superfluid vortex lines in a magnetar core ; with greater magnetic activity , sudden magnetic reconfigurations would result in large core vortex reconfigurations .",
    "we note that @xcite and @xcite argued that the @xcite model must be inapplicable to axps as that model predicts no glitches for periods greater than @xmath91  s. however a more careful reading of @xcite reveals that this prediction does not apply for magnetar - strength magnetic fields .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the high temperatures of axps , as measured from their x - ray spectra , are at odds with the glitch observations .",
    "this is because in the crustal pinning models , the pinning force is highly temperature dependent , such that vortex lines can creep outward much more easily when the temperature is high ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this has long been the explanation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the difference between the crab and vela pulsar glitch behaviors : the hotter crab pulsar glitches less frequently and with smaller frequency jumps because its vortex array can move outward more smoothly .",
    "if this were true , axps , having measured effective temperatures much higher than the crab pulsar , should glitch less frequently and with smaller glitch amplitudes than the crab pulsar , clearly not what is observed . if we abandon the crustal glitch model ( at least in axp glitches ) the absence of the expected temperature dependence and the observed universal age correlation could be explained .",
    "for example , as discussed by @xcite , perhaps relatively smooth outward motion of core vortices could take place before the magnetic flux distribution necessary for impeding them has developed . in this picture , magnetic field distribution , not temperature , is the age - associated property that is a primary factor determining glitch behavior .    finally , @xcite argued , on the basis of seven observations of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  obtained over @xmath210  yr , that observed spectral and flux variations were correlated with glitch epoch .",
    "they predict , given apparent flux increases seen in mid-2004 and mid-2005 , that a glitch should occur soon thereafter ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1708flux ] ) . indeed as we have shown ( see table  [ table1708glitches ] )",
    ", an unambiguous glitch occured just following their mid-2005 observation .",
    "on the other hand , the first candidate glitch ( table  [ table1708cands ] ) occured when the total flux was very low and apparently declining .",
    "thus , if there is a causal connection between long - term flux variations in rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and glitches , either this candidate glitch is not a true glitch , or accompanying radiative changes are only relevant to large glitches .",
    "the sparsity of the total flux measurements , along with the relatively short time scale of the pulsed flux variations we report in rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , suggest that more dense total flux monitoring could reveal yet unseen fluctuations that are not glitch - associated .",
    "the flux variability of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  is discussed further below .",
    "the approximate stabilities of the pulsed fluxes of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045  ( see  [ sec : flux ] ) are in contrast to those seen for axps 1e  2259 + 586 and 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , both of which have shown large pulsed flux variations @xcite , and even 4u  0142 + 61 which has shown a slow pulsed flux increase with time @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the phase - averaged flux of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  has been reported to be highly variable ( @xcite and fig .",
    "[ figure1708flux ] ) , with changes as large as @xmath260% in 2004 - 2005 , while the pulsed flux is not , with maximum contemporaneous change of @xmath92% .",
    "note that this conclusion holds even when the phase - averaged fluxes , reported in the 0.510  kev band , are converted to 210  kev , that used for our _ rxte _ observations .",
    "this suggests an anti - correlation between pulsed fraction and total flux that acts to ensure that the pulsed flux is roughly constant .",
    "if so , pulsed flux is not a good indicator of total energy output for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 .",
    "a similar anti - correlation between total flux and pulsed fraction has been reported for axp 1e  1048@xmath05937 @xcite , although in that case the pulsed flux does not remain constant @xcite , but follows the phase - averaged flux , just with lower dynamic range ( tam et al . ,",
    "submitted ) . for rxs",
    "j170849.0@xmath0400910 , the exactness of the anti - correlation is perhaps surprising .",
    "it could be that all the phase - averaged flux variations are in the 0.52  kev band , invisible to _",
    "rxte_. however this would not jibe with the reported correlation of the phase - averaged fluxes with power - law index @xcite .",
    "we also note that in the phase - averaged flux analysis , the equivalent hydrogen column @xmath93 was allowed to vary from observation to observation , rather than being held fixed at a constant .",
    "this inconsistency could bias the comparison , though likely not by a large amount .",
    "it is tempting to question the relative calibrations of the different instruments used to measure the phase - averaged flux of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , as the greatest dynamic range is implied by lone _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift _ observations , and even the two _ chandra x - ray observatory _ observations were obtained with different instruments . still , admittedly , relative systematic calibration uncertainties are not expected to yield a @xmath9450% dynamic range , as is reported .",
    "regular monitoring with a single imaging instrument could settle this issue .",
    "changes in pulse profile seem to be generic in axps and , as discussed above , are not always correlated with glitches , although in some cases , e.g. , 1e  2259 + 586 , 4u  0142 + 61 , and possibly rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , they are .",
    "spectrally no clear pattern has emerged . in 1e  2259 + 586 , the pulse profile changes following its 2002 event were broadband @xcite , while in 4u  0142 + 61 @xcite and 1e  1841@xmath0045 , they appear more prominent at soft energies . in rxs",
    "j170849.0@xmath0400910 , the changes are more apparent in the hard band . in the context of the magnetar model ,",
    "this hints at crustal motions and surface activity , possibly coupled with magnetospheric activity , with the exact observational manifestation dependent on a variety of factors ranging from viewing geometry to magnetospheric scattering optical depth .",
    "whether ultimately this specific phenomenon will provide insights into the physics of magnetars remains to be seen .",
    "we have reported on long - term _ rxte _ monitoring of axps rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045 , which has allowed us to study these sources timing , pulsed flux , and pulse profile evolutions .    we have discovered four new axp spin - up glitches , one in rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and three in 1e  1841@xmath0045 , plus three new glitch candidates in rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 .",
    "nearly all of the `` classical '' axps have now been seen to glitch , clearly demonstrating that this behavior is generic to the class . moreover , in terms of fractional frequency increases , axps are among the most actively glitching neutron stars known .",
    "further , unlike radio pulsar glitches , axp glitches appear to come in two varieties : those that , like radio pulsars , are radiatively quiet in pulsed flux , and those that are , unlike radio pulsars , radiatively loud , including correlated sudden flux increases and pulse profile changes .",
    "thus far there is no clear correlation between axp glitch size and whether or not it will be radiatively loud or quiet  two of the largest axp glitches thus far were quiet .",
    "we have found a substantial long - term increase in the magnitude of the spin - down rate in the largest glitch from 1e  1841@xmath0045 , and have also shown that large axp glitches often have recoveries that are unusual compared with those seen in radio pulsars .",
    "specifically , their spin - down rates in the days and sometimes weeks after a glitch are significantly larger in absolute value than their long - term spin - down rate .",
    "this latter effect may indicate a temporary reversal in the crust / crustal superfluid lag at the time of the glitch , or possibly more plausibly , and certainly more intriguingly , glitches of the core , which could explain the transient and extended @xmath13 increases , as well as the large @xmath80 value for 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "radiatively , we have found that the pulsed fluxes of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045  are both fairly steady with time .",
    "this is perhaps surprising in light of the large changes in phase - averaged flux that have been reported for rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910 , and suggests , unless the latter are affected by systematic calibration uncertainties , that pulsed flux for this source , as for axp 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 @xcite , is not a good indicator of axp x - ray output .",
    "also , the pulse profiles of rxs  j170849.0@xmath0400910  and 1e  1841@xmath0045  both evolve ; such evolution appears also to be a generic property of axps .",
