    "the purpose of this study is to examine scalar polynomial singularities associated with power - law spacetimes that can be given in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are ( real ) constants and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are functions of @xmath5 only .",
    "helliwell and konkowski @xcite have recently considered the quantum  healing \" of classical singularities in the spacetimes ( [ general ] ) ( for @xmath4 constant and @xmath6 ) . an elementary transformation in @xmath7",
    "can be used to simplify ( [ general ] ) into two cases and in the notation of helliwell and konkowski these are ; @xmath8 for @xmath9 ( type i ) and @xmath10 ( type ii ) .",
    "the present discussion is organized as follows : first we locate all polynomial singularities in these spacetimes , then we examine the affine distance to the singularities along timelike and null geodesics .",
    "further , we examine details in the @xmath11 subspaces , including the construction of double - null coordinates and finally the focusing conditions associated with the singularities .",

    "the tetrad components of the trace - free ricci and weyl tensors vanish identically in four cases : ( i ) @xmath31 , ( ii ) @xmath32 , ( iii ) @xmath33 and ( iv ) @xmath34 . in cases ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) the spacetime is flat . in case",
    "( iv ) the ricci scalar reduces to @xmath35 .",
    "invariants of any spacetime consist of the ricci scalar , the invariant of lowest degree , and invariants of higher degree constructed from appropriate products of the tetrad components of the trace - free ricci and weyl tensors @xcite @xcite . from ( [ ricci ] ) it follows that @xmath36 diverges like @xmath37 as @xmath38 unless @xmath39 substitution of @xmath40 from ( [ beta ] ) into the ricci invariant of next degree shows that the invariant diverges like @xmath41 as @xmath38 unless @xcite @xmath42 substitution of @xmath40 from ( [ beta ] ) and @xmath43 from ( [ next ] ) into the first weyl invariant shows that this invariant diverges like @xmath41 as @xmath38 unless @xmath44 the case @xmath45 gives @xmath46 and @xmath47 , that is , the flat case ( iii ) .",

    "substitution of @xmath40 from ( [ beta ] ) and @xmath50 from ( [ next ] ) into the first weyl invariant shows that this invariant diverges as @xmath41 as @xmath38 for all real @xmath51 and @xmath2 . finally , note that both factors in ( [ next ] ) can not vanish simultaneously for real @xmath51 and @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that for type i power - law spacetimes , except for the four cases ( i ) through ( iv ) , the spacetimes contain a scalar polynomial singularity at @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",
    "now consider the newman - penrose tetrad consisting of ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ n1 ] ) , both with @xmath40 replaced by @xmath54 , along with ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ mbar1 ] ) unchanged .",

    "the ricci scalar itself diverges like @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "it follows that for type ii power - law spacetimes , except for the flat case @xmath66 , the spacetimes contain a scalar polynomial singularity at @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",
    "geodesics of the spacetimes ( [ general ] ) satisfy @xmath67 where @xmath68 in the null case and @xmath69 in the timelike case , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants of the motion and @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an affine parameter .",
    "it follows from ( [ geodesics ] ) that @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are finite and non - zero . as a result ,",
    "the singularities at @xmath52 are at finite affine distance if and only if @xmath77 whereas condition ( [ finite ] ) offers no further restriction on @xmath40 for singularities in type ii spacetimes ( we again have @xmath53 ) , for type i spacetimes we obtain the refined condition @xmath78 for singularities , assuming , as usual , that they must be at a finite affine distance .",
    "in what follows we examine in further detail the @xmath11 subspaces ( designated by @xmath79 ) of the spacetimes ( [ general ] ) . since we are primarily interested in the structure of the singularities at @xmath52 we first explore the conditions under which null geodesics can terminate there . now transforming from @xmath5 to @xmath80 where @xmath81 we have a constant of the motion @xmath82 and the null geodesic equation can be given as @xmath83 where , without loss in generality ,",
    "we have set @xmath84 .",
    "there are four cases of interest : ( i ) if @xmath85 then clearly there are no turning points @xmath86 at finite @xmath7 .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath87 then there is a minimum @xmath7 at @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "( iii ) if @xmath87 then there is a minimum @xmath7 at @xmath88 for @xmath90 .",
    "( iv ) if @xmath91 and @xmath92 then there is a minimum @xmath7 at @xmath93 where @xmath94 as long as the constants of the motion satisfy @xmath95 and @xmath96 if there are minima in @xmath7 along null geodesics then a discussion in the @xmath11 subspace of the spacetimes ( [ general ] ) below the minima is adequate for these geodesics in the sense that they do not populate that region of the @xmath11 subspace .",
    "however , since there are geodesics for which @xmath97 and @xmath82 do not vanish simultaneously and which terminate at @xmath52 , the @xmath11 subspaces are not totally geodesic and discussions restricted to these subspaces are not complete . however , an examination of these subspaces is , though incomplete , very instructive .",
    "we now construct double- null coordinates and examine focusing conditions .",
    "it is clear from ( [ type1ds ] ) and ( [ type2ds ] ) that the trajectories @xmath98 are timelike for @xmath99 .",
    "however , the nature of the singularities at @xmath52 is not clear .",
    "here we construct double - null coordinates to clarify the nature of the singularities . by",

    ". as a result , the singularities at @xmath52 are at finite affine distance only for @xmath53 also as shown above .",

    "trajectories of constant @xmath123 are straight lines through the origin @xmath136 which is a point of internal infinity . a diagram is shown below in figure[type2f ] .      in this section we consider a unified treatment of both types of spacetime .",
    "the vector @xmath137 is tangent to a class of null geodesics of the spacetimes ( [ general ] ) and we use ( [ null ] ) to examine focusing conditions in the @xmath11 subspaces .",
