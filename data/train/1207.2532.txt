    "the importance of thin film technology has been widely recognized in the realms of experimental and applied science , from the manufacture of electronics ( layers of insulators , semiconductors , and conductors from integrated circuits ) to optics ( reflective and anti - reflective coatings , self - cleaning glasses , etc ) and packaging ( e.g. aluminium - coated pet films ) .",
    "indeed , the increasing role of thin films in basic and applied research relies on the development and refinement of nanoscale deposition techniques such as sputtering and molecular beam epitaxy , which allow a single layer of atoms to be deposited at a time  @xcite .    since the growth temperature is one of the critical parameters in the formation of ordered thin films , several experiments have focused on the influence of a temperature gradient during film growth . in an early experiment by tanaka _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , magnetic tb - fe films were grown between two substrates with a temperature gradient , reporting the observation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropies and other gradient - driven structural features .",
    "more recently , schwickert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the `` temperature wedge method '' where a calibrated temperature gradient of several hundred kelvin was established across the substrate during co - deposition of fe and pt on mgo(001 ) and mgo(110 ) substrates .",
    "these experiments generated the @xmath9 ordered phase of fept , which is currently the leading candidate material for ultrahigh density heat assisted magnetic recording ( hamr ) and bit patterned magnetic recording ( bpmr ) media ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "other experiments by yongxiong _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have investigated the evolution of fe oxide nanostructures on gaas(100 ) by using a multi - technique experimental setup that included transmission and reflection high energy electron diffraction and scanning electron microscopy . in these studies ,",
    "nanoscale epitaxial fe films were grown , oxidized , and annealed using a gradient temperature method , which led to nanostripes with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy . as a result of the experimental advances on this field ,",
    "many technological applications have been envisioned as well .",
    "for instance , magneto - optical recording studies of signal reproduction  @xcite have suggested that recording media having multiple magnetic layers in a transverse temperature gradient may suppress magnetic noise from tracks adjacent to the target track during information storage and reproduction  @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", gradients have been studied extensively in the context of diffusion processes and later extended to thermal conductivity and heat conduction problems .",
    "the so - called gradient percolation method was originally introduced to study percolation transition models where the density is the control parameter @xcite and later applied to a variety of problems , such as fractal diffusion fronts  @xcite , overlapping disks in a concentration gradient  @xcite , bond percolation for the kagom lattice  @xcite , invasion percolation under gravity  @xcite , porous media  @xcite , as well as in the study of vegetation distribution  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the gradient method has been extended as a powerful tool to study first- and second - order irreversible phase transitions in far - from - equilibrium systems such as the ziff - gulari - barshad model and forest - fire cellular automata  @xcite . in magnetic systems ,",
    "damage spreading processes in a temperature gradient  @xcite and studies of several one - dimensional models  @xcite have been followed by the investigation of the kinetic ising model in two dimensions under a variety of dynamics  @xcite .    within the broad context of these recent experimental and theoretical investigations ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the irreversible growth of magnetic thin films in a temperature gradient and to provide a full characterization of the gradient - induced critical phase transition .",
    "the magnetic thin film growth process under far - from - equilibrium conditions is investigated by using the so - called magnetic eden model ( mem )  @xcite , an extension of the classical eden model  @xcite in which particles have a two - state spin as an additional degree of freedom .",
    "earlier studies have shown that , growing in @xmath10-dimensional strip geometries in homogeneous thermal baths , mem films are noncritical for @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath12 they undergo an order - disorder phase transition that takes place at @xmath4 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the critical exponents are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , which intriguingly agree within error bars with the exact exponents for the kinetic ising model  @xcite .",
    "since the mem growth process is irreversible and newly deposited particles are not allowed to flip and thermalize once they are added to the growing cluster , the observed correspondence between the mem and the equilibrium ising model remains puzzling .",
    "in this work , we focus on the critical case ( i.e. @xmath12 ) and show that , when applying a transverse temperature gradient maintained by thermal baths between temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at a higher critical temperature ( @xmath16 ) and with different critical exponents .",
    "we also develop a growth bond model and show the existence of bond flux asymmetries caused by the interplay of geometry and thermal bath asymmetries , which shed some light on the growth dynamics and explain qualitatively the shift observed in the critical temperature .",
    "the growth bond model analysis is further supported by the fact that the growing interface is self - affine , thus ensuring that the growing sites are correlated at all size scales .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model and describe the monte carlo algorithm used to simulate mem thin films in a temperature gradient . in section 3 , we present our results and a discussion . finally , section 4 consists of concluding remarks .",
    "the mem in @xmath17dimensions is studied in the square lattice by using a rectangular geometry @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the growth direction .",
    "the location of each spin on the lattice is specified through its coordinates @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the starting seed for the growing cluster is a plane of @xmath23 parallel - oriented spins placed at @xmath24 and cluster growth takes place along the positive longitudinal direction ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "across one of the transverse directions ( the @xmath26axis ) , a temperature gradient is applied by thermal baths at fixed temperatures linearly varying between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . therefore , in our setup each layer at fixed @xmath27 is subjected to a constant temperature @xmath28 maintained by a thermal bath .",
    "we adopt open boundary conditions along the @xmath26direction , while continuous boundary conditions are considered along the @xmath29direction .",
    "clusters are grown by selectively adding two - state spins ( @xmath30 ) to perimeter sites , which are defined as the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) empty sites of the already occupied ones .",
    "let us recall that the substrate is a @xmath31 cubic lattice and therefore each lattice site in the bulk has 6 nn sites .",
    "considering a ferromagnetic interaction of strength @xmath32 between nn spins , the energy @xmath33 of a given configuration of spins is given by @xmath34 where the summation @xmath35 is taken over occupied nn sites .",
    "the boltzmann constant is set equal to unity throughout , and both temperature and energy are measured in units of @xmath36 .",
    "the probability for a perimeter site at @xmath20 to be occupied by a spin is proportional to the boltzmann factor @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the change of energy involved in the addition of the spin and @xmath39 is the temperature at the perimeter site .    at each step",
    ", all perimeter sites have to be considered and the probabilities of adding a new ( either up or down ) spin to each site must be evaluated . using the monte carlo simulation method , after all probabilities are computed and normalized , the growth site and the orientation of the new spin are both simultaneously determined by means of a pseudo - random number .",
    "notice that the mem s growth rules require updating the probabilities at each time step and lead to very slow algorithms compared with analogous equilibrium spin models . since the observables of interest ( e.g. the mean transverse magnetization along the @xmath29direction and its higher moments ) require the growth of samples with a large number of transverse planes of size @xmath40 , clusters having up to @xmath41 spins have typically been grown for lattice sizes in the range @xmath42 . also , let us point out again that , although eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) resembles the ising hamiltonian , the mem is a nonequilibrium model in which new spins are continuously added , while older spins remain frozen and are not allowed to flip , detach , nor diffuse .    as in the case of the classical eden model",
    ", the magnetic eden model leads to a compact bulk and a self - affine growth interface  @xcite ( see sect . 3.4 for a detailed finite - size scaling analysis of the interface width ) .",
    "the growth front may temporarily create voids within the bulk , usually not far from the rough growth interface .",
    "however , since the boundaries of these voids are also perimeter sites , they ultimately become filled at some point during the growth process .",
    "hence , far behind the active growth interface , the system is compact and frozen , and the different quantities of interest can thus be measured on defect - free transverse planes .",
    "notice that the growth of magnetic eden aggregates in @xmath43-strip geometries is characterized by an initial transient length @xmath44 ( measured along the growth direction , i.e. the @xmath45axis ) followed by a nonequilibrium stationary state that is independent of the initial configuration  @xcite .",
    "we considered starting seeds formed by @xmath40 up spins ( i.e. @xmath46 ) but any choice for the seed leads to the same stationary states for @xmath47 . by disregarding the transient region , all results reported in this paper",
    "are obtained under stationary conditions . also notice that , since the films are effectively semi - infinite and the substrate length along the growth direction plays no role , the only characteristic length is the transverse linear size @xmath48 .",
    "= 5.2 in = 2.1 in    let us begin by considering a fixed gradient between temperatures @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the effect of changing this gradient will be discussed later .",
    "figure 1 shows the snapshot of a longitudinal slice for a fixed value of the transverse coordinate @xmath51 .",
    "the temperature gradient is applied along the transverse @xmath26direction , while the system grows from left to right along the longitudinal @xmath52 direction .",
    "notice that the bulk grows compact , because although voids and holes in the bulk may eventually occur , they ultimately become filled at some point during the growth process .",
    "the bottom layers grow in contact with thermal baths at cold temperatures , which favor the formation of well - ordered spin domains .",
    "in contrast , the top layers grow in contact with hot thermal baths that promote bulk disorder . as will be shown below , the interplay of model growth dynamics , geometry , and thermal bath asymmetries lead to the onset of gradient - driven order - disorder critical phase transitions that can be quantitatively characterized .",
    "= 3.3 in    in order to take into account the asymmetries introduced by the temperature gradient , we can quantify the degree of order in the system by considering the magnetization of transverse columns at constant temperature ( i.e. along the @xmath51-axis ) : @xmath53    figure 2 shows the probability distributions of @xmath54 for a system of linear size @xmath55 growing in a temperature gradient between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "notice that different plots correspond to different layers and , therefore , to different temperatures within the gradient s range , as indicated .",
    "as expected for a continuous order - disorder phase transition , the low - temperature distributions are bimodal and peaked at the spontaneous magnetization @xmath56 @xmath57 . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the peaks approach each other and merge smoothly , ultimately leading to a gaussian distribution peaked at @xmath58 for high temperatures , which is characteristic of the disordered phase . indeed , the smooth shift of the distribution maxima across @xmath59 , from the low - temperature nonzero spontaneous magnetization @xmath56 to the high - temperature gaussian centered at @xmath58 , is the signature of true thermally - driven continuous phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "= 3.3 in    notice that the distributions in figure 2 are symmetrical , since there exists a finite probability for fluctuations to grow and switch the magnetization from @xmath60 to @xmath61 and viceversa .",
    "since monte carlo simulations are restricted to finite samples , the standard procedure to avoid these shortcomings due to finite - size effects is to average the absolute value of the order parameter  @xcite . in this context , the appropriate order parameter is the mean absolute magnetization of transverse columns at constant temperature , i.e. @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes averages along the growth direction @xmath52 within the stationary region .",
    "figure 3 shows plots of the mean absolute magnetization as a function of the layer temperature for different system sizes in the range @xmath42 .",
    "for any given system size , at low temperatures the system grows ordered and the magnetization is close to unity , while at higher temperatures the disorder sets on and the magnetization becomes significantly smaller .",
    "however , fluctuations due to the finite system size prevent the magnetization from becoming strictly zero above the critical temperature , so the transition between the low - temperature ordered phase and the high - temperature disordered phase becomes smoothed out and rounded .",
    "as expected , larger systems are less affected by finite - size effects and display sharper transitions .    strictly speaking , however , these results just show evidence of _ pseudo_-phase transitions , which might be precursors of true phase transitions taking place in the thermodynamic limit . in the following , we will characterize in more detail this pseudo - critical phenomenon by measuring other observables on finite - size systems . in the next subsection",
    ", we will use standard finite - size scaling procedures to establish the existence of a non - trivial critical temperature in the @xmath64 limit , as well as to calculate critical exponents that describe the behavior of the infinite system at criticality .",
    "= 3.3 in    let us now consider the magnetic susceptibility @xmath65 , given by @xmath66 for equilibrium systems , the susceptibility is related to order parameter fluctuations by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "although the validity of a fluctuation - dissipation relation in the case of a nonequilibrium system is less evident , we will assume eq .",
    "( [ chimi ] ) to hold also for the mem .",
    "indeed , as shown in earlier studies of nonequilibrium spin models  @xcite , this definition of @xmath65 proves very useful for exploring critical phenomena under far - from - equilibrium conditions . in section 3.2",
    ", we will characterize the critical behavior in the thermodynamic limit through critical exponents and finite - size scaling relations by applying the equilibrium theory to our far - from - equilibrium model .",
    "figure 4 shows plots of @xmath65 vs @xmath39 for different system sizes , as indicated .",
    "as with the thermal dependence of the order parameter shown in figure 3 , the peaks of the susceptibility become rounded and shifted , indicating the existence of pseudo - phase transitions in finite - size mem thin films . increasing the system size ,",
    "the peaks become sharper and higher , as expected for a critical system .",
    "= 3.3 in    since the results presented thus far considered a fixed gradient between the temperatures @xmath49 and @xmath50 , let us now investigate the effects of changing the gradient span @xmath67 . with this aim , we keep the same temperature for the thermal bath at the cold end ( @xmath49 ) and consider a substantially higher temperature for the thermal bath at the hot end ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "figure  [ comparison ] compares the mean absolute magnetization for these two different gradient ranges ( i.e. @xmath69 ) for systems of size @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we observe that increasing the gradient span shifts the magnetization profiles towards higher temperatures .",
    "that is , the temperature of a given layer does not uniquely determine its degree of order , since the mean magnetization of the layer also depends on the overall gradient span under which the film grows .",
    "similar shifts towards higher temperatures are also seen in higher - order moments of the order parameter probability distributions , such as the susceptibility and binder s fourth - order cumulant ( not shown here for the sake of space ) .",
    "alternatively , we can compare systems of different sizes and gradient spans such that the local gradients @xmath72 are the same .",
    "the inset to figure  [ comparison ] shows a comparison between a system of size @xmath73 and gradient span @xmath74 ( dashed lines ) and another system of size @xmath75 and gradient span @xmath76 ( dotted lines ) , both of which have the same local gradient @xmath77 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the mixed case @xmath75 and @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath78 ) .",
    "we observe that the systems with the same local gradient have similar magnetization in layers at intermediate temperatures ( i.e. approximately in the range @xmath79 ) .",
    "however , the magnetization profiles for equal-@xmath80 systems differ noticeably in layers closer to the borders of the sample .",
    "the arrows in figure  [ comparison ] show that the shifts for smaller systems are significantly larger than the corresponding shifts for larger systems .",
    "defining the finite - size pseudo - critical temperature @xmath81 as the temperature corresponding to @xmath82 , the shift for @xmath70 is @xmath83 , while the corresponding shift for @xmath71 is @xmath84 .",
    "this observation suggests that differences arising from changing the gradient span might just reflect finite - size effects that vanish in the @xmath64 limit . in the next subsection",
    ", we study the critical behavior of mem films and confirm that , in fact , these differences are merely finite - size effects that become irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "so far , we have found evidence for the existence of a gradient - driven order - disorder phase transition from the analysis of order parameter probability distributions , the order parameter mean absolute value ( magnetization ) and its fluctuations ( susceptibility ) in the growth of finite - size magnetic films . in this subsection , we apply standard finite - size scaling techniques to show the existence of this phase transition in the thermodynamic limit and to determine critical exponents that characterize the system s critical behavior and universality class .",
    "= 3.3 in    the binder cumulant , defined by @xmath85 is a fourth - order cumulant dependent on the variance and the kurtosis of the order parameter probability distribution .",
    "one important property of the binder cumulant is that , for large system sizes , the low - temperature , ordered region tends to the value @xmath86 , while the high - temperature , disordered region tends to @xmath87 .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit , the function becomes discontinuous exactly at the critical temperature .",
    "moreover , since for second - order phase transitions , the scaling prefactor of the cumulant is independent of the sample size , plots of @xmath88 versus the control parameter lead to a common ( size - independent ) intersection point that corresponds to the location of the critical value of the order parameter in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ cumulant ] shows the binder cumulant as a function of the layer temperature for different system sizes in the range @xmath42 .",
    "the inset to figure  [ cumulant ] shows a detailed view of the same data for the largest lattices ( @xmath89 ) , where the intersection region is indicated by a grey vertical strip .",
    "based on this observation , we determine the critical temperature in the @xmath64 limit as @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , this value is significantly higher than the corresponding critical temperature for the mem growing in an homogeneous thermal bath ( i.e. in the absence of a temperature gradient ) , namely @xmath4 @xcite . in the next subsection",
    ", we will explore the growth dynamics and explain qualitatively this shift in the critical temperature as due to ordering effects caused by a net transverse growth bond flux induced by thermal asymmetries .",
    "notice also that , by fixing the temperature range ( i.e. the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and increasing @xmath48 , we are effectively considering different gradients @xmath90 that become smaller as @xmath48 is increased .",
    "figure  [ cumulant ] , which shows a fixed point in the binder cumulants as the gradients are changed , provides therefore quantitative evidence for the existence of a gradient - independent phase transition taking place at the temperature @xmath91 .    according to the finite - size scaling theory , developed for the treatment of finite - size effects at criticality under equilibrium conditions  @xcite , the difference between the true critical temperature , @xmath91 , and the effective pseudo - critical one , @xmath81 , is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the exponent that characterizes the divergence of the correlation length at criticality .",
    "as mentioned above , we define the finite - size pseudo - critical temperature @xmath81 as the temperature corresponding to @xmath82 .",
    "= 3.3 in    let us point out that , given the lack of a comprehensive theory of non - equilibrium phase transitions , concepts and definitions developed in the context of equilibrium phenomena are customarily borrowed and applied to far - from - equilibrium phenomena as well .",
    "for a review of standard methods , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "indeed , although this approach is ad - hoc and lacks the theoretical foundations of equilibrium systems , it has been used extensively in the literature and has become a powerful means of advancing our knowledge within the realm of non - equilibrium phenomena . for instance , numerical methods such as monte carlo simulations or series expansions are restricted to finite systems and it is therefore important to understand how far finite - size effects influence the properties of the system . as known from equilibrium statistical mechanics , finite - size effects are particularly strong close to the critical point , where the spatial correlation length becomes comparable with the linear dimensions of the system . by introducing the system size as an additional parameter , finite - size scaling laws are used to characterize the steady state of finite far - from - equilibrium systems through appropriate scaling exponents , such as , for instance , the exponent @xmath93 in eq.([scaling1 ] ) above . moreover , this procedure allows us to define universality classes of non - equilibrium systems , as reviewed e.g. in refs .",

    "previously , we pointed out the fact that the gradient - driven order - disorder phase transition occurs at a temperature that is significantly higher than the corresponding critical temperature for the mem growing in an homogeneous thermal bath ( i.e. in the absence of a temperature gradient ) .",
    "the results presented in this subsection allow a qualitative explanation for the shift in the critical temperature .",
    "indeed , the temperature gradient breaks the transverse symmetry along the @xmath26direction , causing the onset of a net transverse growth bond flux .",
    "this flux is directed from the ordered layers ( that grow at @xmath136 ) towards the disordered layers ( that grow at @xmath137 ) , thus expanding the low - temperature ordering effects across layers at higher temperatures .",
    "this gradient - induced transverse ordering mechanism increases the system s critical temperature .",
    "according to the analysis presented in section 3.3 , the system s critical temperature is increased due to gradient - induced transverse ordering mechanisms that originate in the cold layers .",
    "it could be argued , however , that , since the distance between the cold layer at @xmath1 and a layer at a fixed temperature @xmath138 becomes larger as @xmath48 is increased ( while keeping fixed the gradient span @xmath120 ) , then the transverse flux effects may become weaker and eventually negligible in the large-@xmath48 limit . in this subsection",
    "we show that the growth interface is self - affine and its shape is stable and independent of size .",
    "therefore , we confirm that the effects described in section 3.3 are still relevant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "= 3.3 in    in order to track the evolution of the growth interface , we compute the position of the perimeter sites in the active region every time a monolayer of @xmath139 spins is deposited .",
    "the interface width at time @xmath140 is defined by @xmath141 where the sum is taken over the @xmath142 perimeter sites in the active growth region , @xmath143 is the longitudinal coordinate of the @xmath144th perimeter site , and @xmath145 is the center of the interface .",
    "figure  [ transient ] shows the interface width as a function of time for different lattice sizes in the range @xmath42 , where the time unit corresponds to the deposition of @xmath139 spins .",
    "after a short transient period , the interface reaches a stable saturation width , @xmath146 , analogously to other surface growth phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the inset to figure  [ transient ] shows the dependence of @xmath146 on the system size @xmath48 , where the statistical errors are smaller than the size of the symbols .",
    "the fit to the data ( solid line ) shows that @xmath147 , where the roughness exponent is @xmath148 .",
    "that is , the saturation width scales linearly with the system size .",
    "= 3.3 in    by subtracting the interface center , @xmath149 , we can compute the average interface profile in the stationary regime , as shown in figure  [ profile ] .",
    "we find that , when scaled by the mean interface width , interface profiles for different system sizes collapse into a universal shape for the growth interface .",
    "this nearly - linear universal shape is qualitatively consistent with the roughness exponent @xmath150 , as it has quantitatively been determined . in passing , notice also that this universal profile shows a good agreement with the instantaneous snapshot displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that the active growth interface is self - affine and has universal features : the detailed analysis of bond flux asymmetries presented in section 3.3 for a fixed lattice size ( @xmath75 ) remains valid for larger systems .",
    "in particular , our analysis focused on the influence exerted by the low - temperature layers into higher - temperature layers , which therefore is a gradient - induced growth mechanism still relevant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in addition to the roughness exponent @xmath151 , self - affine interfaces are also characterized by a fractal dimension @xmath152 .",
    "in fact , within short length - scales such that @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the longitudinal interface distance along the growth direction between two points separated by a transverse distance @xmath155 , the fractal dimension is @xmath156  @xcite . in the long length - scale limit , moreover , the fractal dimension of the self - affine interface is @xmath157 , irrespective of its roughness  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the growth interface of the mem in a thermal gradient is @xmath157 at both short and long length - scales . indeed , these conclusions are in full agreement with the nearly - linear shape of the growing interface that is consistent with a unitary fractal dimension at all length - scales , as seen in figure  [ profile ] .    here , it is useful to compare the obtained results with those from related , well - studied growth models . for the standard mem growing in a homogeneous temperature bath at high temperatures ,",
    "the attachment of spins is a stochastic ( random ) process that becomes independent of the interaction energy and the temperature  @xcite .",
    "thus , in this limit , the growth interface of the standard mem  @xcite agrees with that of the classic eden model  @xcite , which is well known to belong to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class  @xcite .",
    "the most accurate simulation results for the kpz model in @xmath17dimensions yield @xmath158  @xcite , which agrees well with some of the formerly reported values for kpz  @xcite and the eden model  @xcite .",
    "using this value for the roughness , the fractal dimension of the growth interface of the mem in an homogeneous thermal bath at high temperatures crosses over from @xmath159 ( at short length - scales ) to @xmath160 ( at long length - scales ) .",
    "moreover , we can safely expect that the self - affine properties of the growth interface of the standard mem ( in an homogeneous bath ) be independent of the temperature within a wide range around and below the critical temperature , at least insofar the occurrence of a layering / roughening transition , in the sense of that observed in the @xmath161dimensional ising model  @xcite , can be neglected .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the fractal and self - affine characteristics of the growth interface of the mem in a constant temperature bath are quite different than those of the same model growing in a temperature gradient .    on the other hand , due to the fact that the mem grown under a temperature - gradient constraint exhibits a second - order transition , one may also consider the self - affine properties of the interface between the ordered and the disordered phases .",
    "although for systems under equilibrium conditions a useful ( alternative ) approach is the evaluation of the damaged interface  @xcite , the damage spreading technique can not straightforwardly be applied for the evaluation of an interface in an irreversible growth model .",
    "furthermore , the implementation and application of a cluster counting algorithm  @xcite to our model would require formidable computational task that is beyond the aim of this paper .",
    "additional shortcomings for this kind of calculations are the definition of the suitable cluster ( e.g. swendsen - wang vs physical clusters ) and the occurrence of noticeable corrections to scaling that one needs to evaluate in order to obtain reliable exponents  @xcite , which is also a task that lies beyond our computational capabilities . however , from heuristic arguments based on the standard scaling relationship @xmath162  @xcite , where @xmath163 is the roughness exponent of the order - disorder interface , we can conjecture that @xmath164 , which yields a self - affine order - disorder interface with short length - scale fractal dimension @xmath165 . for comparison , by applying the same scaling relationship to the standard mem growing in an homogeneous thermal bath ,",
    "we obtain @xmath166 and @xmath167 . thus , although the growth interface is very significantly affected by the temperature gradient compared to the thermally homogeneous system , the geometry of the order - disorder interface is not so markedly affected by the gradient constraint and the results for both systems agree within error bars .",
    "in this work , we studied magnetic thin films growing under far - from - equilibrium conditions in @xmath43-dimensional strip geometries , where a temperature gradient is applied across one of the transverse directions .",
    "we modeled the thin film growth process by means of extensive monte carlo simulations performed on the magnetic eden model ( mem ) , in which spins are deposited on a growing cluster with probabilities dependent on a ferromagnetic , ising - like configuration energy .",
    "firstly , we studied the thermal dependence of order parameter probability distributions , the order parameter mean absolute value ( magnetization ) , the order parameter fluctuations ( susceptibility ) and its higher moments ( binder cumulant ) on finite - size magnetic films , which showed the existence of gradient - driven pseudo - phase transitions .",
    "secondly , we applied binder s cumulant method and finite - size scaling analysis in order to characterize quantitatively the critical behavior of mem films growing in a temperature gradient .",
    "the system s critical temperature is @xmath5 , significantly higher than the mem s critical temperature when growing in an homogeneous thermal bath , namely @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents are @xmath96 , @xmath104 , and @xmath107 , which also differ from the mem s exponents in the absence of a temperature gradient  @xcite . by changing the gradient span , we observed finite - size effects that vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence , the critical temperature and exponents are universal for mem films growing in a temperature gradient .",
    "we also investigated the system s growth dynamics by means of a bond model .",
    "we found that the interplay of geometry and thermal bath asymmetries leads to growth bond flux asymmetries and the onset of transverse ordering effects that explain qualitatively the shift observed in the critical temperature .",
    "finally , we analyzed the self - affine growth interface and obtained a collapse of the scaled average growth profile in the stationary regime for different lattice sizes , which shows that growth bond flux asymmetries play a relevant role in the model s growth dynamics even in the thermodynamic limit .    in the context of a great experimental and theoretical interest in magnetic systems growing in temperature gradients , as well as a wide variety of technological applications that benefit from these efforts ,",
    "we hope that this work will contribute to the progress of this research field and stimulate further work .",
