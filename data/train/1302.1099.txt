    "these first - principles results , however , contain all of the unique me physics , that is , if the polarization is reversed either the bulk magnetization will reverse or the antiferromagnetic order will change in such a way that the sign of the bulk magnetoelectric tensor changes sign . to understand the consequences of these two choices",
    "we next derive a simple phenomenological theory  valid for any trimer domain , @xmath6 , and any spin configuration  starting from a microscopic model .",

    "implies that the relative orientation of the spins in consecutive spin planes is arbitrary . the trimer distortion , however , splits the three degenerate interactions into : a single @xmath110 interaction , mediated by two equivalent tm - o - lu1-o - tm exchange pathways , and two @xmath111 interactions , where each interaction is mediated by a tm - o - lu1-o - tm and a tm - o - lu2-o - tm exchange pathway ( see fig.s8b ) .",

    "this is important . in ferrites ,",
    "the afm nature of the interlayer exchange is uniquely determined by the orbital occupancy , it is always afm and therefore ferrites will always prefer @xmath118-type magnetic configurations and the wfm ground state .",
    "( although the interlayer exchange in lmo is fm , which explains why it prefers @xmath119-type magnetic configurations , it is not universally so ; a discussion is given in the supplement ) .",
    "in this paper we have discussed an intriguing consequence of improper ferroelectricity in the hexagonal manganite - like systems .",
    "we have shown for the first time that a non - polar trimer structural distortion not only induces an electrical polarization but also induces bulk weak - ferromagnetism and a bulk linear magnetoelectric vortex structure .",
    "it is a universal feature of a@xmath17-type hexa systems in which the trimer distortion mediates an intrinsic bulk trilinear - coupling of the polarization , magnetization , and antiferromagnetic order .",
    "note that it was recently inferred from neutron diffraction  @xcite that lfo orders above room temperature ( high for a frustrated magnet ) in an afm state with @xmath120 , and at a lower temperature undergoes a reorientation transition to the a@xmath21 phase inducing a @xmath121 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , the a@xmath15 ( @xmath120 by symmetry ) and a@xmath21 ( finite @xmath1 allowed ) states , lie energetically very close to ground state in lfo , which support such a picture .",
    "there is , however , an intriguing alternative scenario involving a crossover from a state in which several magnetic order types are degenerate to the a@xmath17 spin configuration ground state , driven by the trimer distortion .",
    "note that the symmetry of the pe structure not only implies that the a and b spin configurations are degenerate , but in fact that all of the principle spin configurations are degenerate as there can be no in plane anisotropy .",
    "the trimer distortion lifts the degeneracy between the a and b spin configurations as @xmath122 while the in plane anisotropy due to the effective dm - like interaction ( the trimer distortion induced in plane anisotropy of the sia tensor is negligible ) always favors phases with canted spins and is lifted as @xmath123 as we show in the supplemental . in this picture , as temperature is lowered and the trimer distortion increases in magnitude , there is a smooth crossover to the a@xmath17 state .",

    "<S> two themes at the forefront of materials physics are the cross - coupling of distinct types of ferroic order  @xcite and topological defects in systems with spontaneous broken symmetry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> common to both are a plethora of novel phenomenon to understand , and new properties and functionalities to exploit for novel applications . </S>",
    "<S> multiferroics  @xcite are an ideal platform to realize both themes in a single material . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> an exciting development is the discovery of a topologically protected vortex - domain structure in one of the most extensively studied class of multiferroics , the hexagonal ( hexa ) rare - earth manganites . here , </S>",
    "<S> antiphase structural ( ` trimer ' ) domains are clamped to ferroelectric domain walls ( and vice versa )  @xcite forming a ` clover - leaf ' pattern , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> these trimer domains have a particular phase relationship that result in the appearance of structural vortices , which in turn induce magnetic vortices  @xcite , strongly coupled antiferromagnetism and the polarization at the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> this domain wall magnetoelectric phenomenon produces a magnetization localized at the wall  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the key to realizing these unusual effects is the improper nature of ferroelectricity . here </S>",
    "<S> the polarization ( @xmath2 ) which is stable in the paraelectric ( pe ) p6@xmath0/mmc structure , is induced by a zone - tripling structural distortion , @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , referred to as the trimer distortion , is associated with a 2-up/1-down buckling of the r - planes and tilting of the mno@xmath4 bipyramids , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b . </S>",
    "<S> it is nonlinearly coupled to the polarization , @xmath5 the form of which implies that a nonzero trimer distortion induces a nonzero @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> there are three distinct @xmath6 domains ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) corresponding to one of the 3 permutations of 2-up/1-down . </S>",
    "<S> also there are two tilting directions , either towards ( + ) or away from ( @xmath10 ) the @xmath11 axis , i.e. , 1-up/2-down or 2-up/1-down , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this results in six p6@xmath0 cm structural domains . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of the improper origin of ferroelectricity is that the sign of @xmath2 depends on the direction of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this simple fact leads to the nontrivial domain structure of the hexa manganites , fig  [ fig1]a  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> our focus here is on elucidating a remarkable interplay of this trimerization , magnetism , and polarization in the hexa manganite structure . </S>",
    "<S> we show from first principles that the trimer structural distortion not only induces a @xmath2 , but can also induce both a _ bulk _ magnetization , @xmath1 , and a _ bulk _ linear me effect . </S>",
    "<S> we make this clear by connecting an exact microscopic theory of spin - lattice coupling to a simple phenomenological theory . </S>",
    "<S> this not only brings additional insight to known experiments , but leads us to discover entirely new bulk phenomena , not previously seen in a multiferroic such as 1 ) the existence of a linear magnetoelectric ( me ) vortex structure and 2 ) a bulk coupling of ferroelectric ( fe ) and ferromagnetic domains such that if @xmath2 reverses 180@xmath12 so does @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the former is widely accessible in most hexa rmno@xmath0 manganites under large magnetic fields , while the latter is realizable in the ground state of a new family of materials , the hexa rfeo@xmath0 ferrites . </S>",
    "<S> recently thin films of rfeo@xmath0 have been epitaxially stabilized in the hexa p6@xmath0 cm structure  @xcite . by performing a detail comparison of the ferrites to the manganites </S>",
    "<S> we explain why the ground state of all ferrites display an intrinsic , bulk @xmath1 and _ bulk _ linear me effect . </S>"
