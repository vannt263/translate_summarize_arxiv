    ", different ordered phases can be classified in a very similar way to liquid crystals .",
    "for instance , a stripe phase , that breaks translation invariance in one direction , has the same symmetries of the _ smectic _ phase . on the other hand , phases breaking only rotation invariance , but preserving translations , are called _ nematic _ phases .",
    "this equivalence allows us to generically call these phases `` quantum liquid crystals '' @xcite .",
    "in particular , theories for the quantum hall smectic phase@xcite and the nematic fermi liquid@xcite was presented some time ago .    in some strongly correlated systems ,",
    "the superconductor ( sc ) order parameter can break rotational as well as discrete translational invariance , in such a way that the orientational and positional orders are intertwined with the sc and magnetic orders@xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the traditional classification of s - wave , d - wave , etc . , coming from the irreducible representation of the lattice point symmetry group , does no longer apply .",
    "an important particular example is the _ pair density wave _ state ( pdw)@xcite .",
    "it was originally proposed to describe the striking dynamical dimensional decoupling , observed in @xmath1 near @xmath2@xcite .",
    "similar effects have been observed in stripe - ordered @xmath3@xcite and in the magnetic - field induced stripe - ordered phase of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the pdw state can be thought as a condensate of cooper pairs with finite momentum .",
    "interestingly , there is a recent claim that a pdw state has been measured in @xmath5 by means of nanometre - resolution scanned josephson tunneling microscopy @xcite .",
    "the nematic superconductor , that we study in this paper , is induced by the more basic pdw state .",
    "consider , for instance , the simplest unidirectional pdw state characterized by a wave vector @xmath6 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "both order parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , represent cooper pairs ( charge @xmath11 ) with momentum @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the state is characterized by two complex order parameters .",
    "the corresponding phases can be identified as the superconducting phase @xmath12 and the smectic displacement @xmath13 . since @xmath14 are defined modulo @xmath15 , the related phases @xmath16 are defined modulo @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the pdw state supports several topological defects , such as vortices , double dislocations and half - vortices bounded to single dislocations@xcite . by means of thermal melting",
    ", several phases can be reached from the pdw state , producing a very rich phase diagram@xcite .",
    "one of these phases , called _ nematic - superconductor _ ( nsc ) is reached from the pdw state by thermal proliferation of double dislocations .",
    "the proliferation of dislocations restores the translation invariance , retaining the sc as well as the orientational ( nematic ) order .",
    "the nsc is understood as a quadratic combination @xmath18 . in this way",
    ", @xmath19 is a complex homogeneous order parameter , since the combination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 cancels any modulation in @xmath6 .",
    "however , the state still `` remember '' the original orientation of @xmath6 , thus , producing an homogeneous anisotropic state .",
    "interestingly , from its definition , it is simple to check that , under gauge transformations , it transforms with double the phase of the pdw state , since @xmath22 .",
    "then , this superconductor state should be interpreted as a condensation of four particles and not of cooper pairs .",
    "for this reason it is also called `` charge-@xmath23 nematic superconductor '' ( @xmath23-nsc ) .",
    "nematic fluctuations enhance this state since , for weak lattice couplings , the pdw phase turns out to be unstable . indeed , in the limit where the lattice is completely decoupled , two - dimensional positional order can not exist , due to linearly divergent fluctuations@xcite .",
    "it is highly hypothesized that the nsc state could exist in the pseudogap region of cuprates .",
    "indeed , several experimental clues point in this direction .",
    "for instance , fluctuating stripes have been measured@xcite at the onset of the pseudo - gap state of @xmath5 . moreover , measurements of the nernst effect in @xmath24@xcite showed that the pseudogap temperature coincides with the appearance of a strong in - plane anisotropy of electronic origin , compatible with the electronic nematic phase@xcite .",
    "the nsc state has extremely interesting properties .",
    "its main topological defects are half - vortices ( vortices with half a flux ) and disclinations .",
    "thus , thermal melting could produce a metallic nematic phase ( by proliferation of half - vortices ) or even an isotropic superconductor ( by proliferation of disclinations ) .",
    "however , the scenario is not so simple since , as we will show , vortices and disclinations are strongly interacting .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the structure of the topological defects supported by the nsc state . by means of a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , we compute the vortex and the disclination profiles in two different regimes : a very diluted regime , where vortices and disclinations can be considered isolated ( with axial symmetry ) , and a high density regime , where vortices and disclinations tend to form lattice structures .",
    "the effect of local nematicity is to produce a fluctuating metric which produces a geometrical coupling between the nematic and the sc order parameter . in some sense",
    ", the system behaves similarly to an order parameter living in a curved surface@xcite .",
    "we have found that the geometrical coupling tends to align the nematic director perpendicularly or parallel to the supercurrent , depending on the sign of the coupling .",
    "this effect implies that vortices are strongly tightened to disclinations .",
    "we will show that , at short distances , both topological defects interact through a quadratic potential .",
    "the excitations are harmonic oscillations with frequency @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the sc condensation energy and @xmath27 is the geometrical coupling constant . the potential remains attractive when the separation between the vortex and the disclination growths , having a logarithmic dependence at large distances . in the high density regime",
    ", this strongly attractive interaction induces the system to be arranged in a lattice of vortices tightly bounded to disclinations .",
    "while vortices prefer to form triangular lattices , disclinations have a tendency to form square lattices .",
    "then , there is a competition produced by the geometrical coupling , opening the possibility of a structural phase transition between lattices with different symmetries .",
    "the nsc state has never been directly detected , however , there is strong evidence that its parent pdw state has a relevant role near the pseudogap regime and could be recently been observed@xcite .",
    "a clear signature of the existence of the nsc state should be a detection of a half - flux ( @xmath28 ) vortex , possibly by means of a squid loop arrangement@xcite .",
    "due to the strong interaction between vortices and disclinations , in this paper we open the interesting possibility of probing the nsc state by using mechanical probes@xcite .    along the paper we present details of the model and calculations that conduce to the above described main results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : orderparameters ] we review the superconductor and the nematic order parameters and we show how to build the ginzburg - landau theory for the nsc state . in  [ sec : london ] we analyze the simplest approximation , in which the relevant degrees of freedom are the sc and the nematic phases .",
    "section [ sec : vortexdisclination ] is the main part of the paper . in  [ sec : isolatedvortex ] we compute the profile of an isolated vortex - disclination with axial symmetry while in the subsection [ subsec : lattice ] we analyze the case of a high density of vortices and disclinations showing the competition between different lattice symmetries .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in  [ sec : discussion ] and reserve three appendices to show computational details .",
    "the nematic superconductor is an example of a quantum liquid crystal@xcite .",
    "it is an homogeneous electronic state that breaks gauge as well as rotation invariance .",

    "self - contained , we briefly review in this section the ginzburg - landau theory for the nsc state@xcite , paying special attention on the geometrical coupling induced by nematicity@xcite .",

    ", the nematic order parameter behaves as a fluctuating metric@xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that the effect of nematicity as an effective fluctuating metric was recently found in other electronic systems such as fractional quantum hall systems@xcite .",

    "<S> the nematic - superconductor state is an example of a quantum liquid crystal that breaks gauge as well as rotation invariance . </S>",
    "<S> it was conjectured to exist in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates high @xmath0 superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the nematic - superconductor state is characterized by two complex order parameters : one of them is related with superconductivity and the other one describes a nematic order . </S>",
    "<S> it supports two main classes of topological defects : half - vortices and disclinations . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a ginzburg - landau approach to study the structure of these topological defects . due to a geometrical coupling between the superconductor and the nematic order parameters , </S>",
    "<S> we show that vortices are strongly coupled with disclinations . </S>",
    "<S> we have found a restoring force between vortices and disclinations that produces harmonic excitations whose natural frequency depends on the geometrical coupling constant and the superconductor condensation energy . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in a regime with high density of defects , we have found a structural phase transition between vortex - disclination lattices with different symmetries . </S>"
