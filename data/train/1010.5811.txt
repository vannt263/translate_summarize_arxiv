    "the liquid argon time projection chamber ( lar tpc ) @xcite is a homogeneous 3d tracking device for charged particles with excellent - bubble chamber like - imaging properties and at the same time it is a fine grain calorimeter for fully contained particles due to the measurement of the energy loss de / dx . the icarus collaboration has demonstrated the feasibility of this novel technology for large mass detectors .",

    "the goal was to study the drift properties of free electrons in lar in the presence of a magnetic field and to prove that the imaging capabilities are not affected .",
    "a detailed description of the experiment is given in @xcite and results were published in @xcite .",
    "fig.[setup ] is a 3d cad drawing showing a cut through the setup with the essential components of the experiment .",
    "the scintillators on top of the magnet , in the bore hole on top of the cryostat , and at the bottom of the magnet were used to trigger on cosmic ray muons .",
    "the lar cryostat was inserted into the recycled sindrum i magnet from psi which allowed to test the chamber in a maximal field of 0.55 t .",
    "the cryostat consists of three concentrical stainless steel cylinders : the innermost cylinder contains the purified lar with the drift chamber , the second cylinder is a ln@xmath1 bath kept at a pressure of 2.7 bar in order not to freeze out the lar at about 1 bar , and the outermost cylinder is for the insulation vacuum .",

    "the first two detector planes ( induction planes ) are wire chambers with @xmath4 wires oriented at @xmath5 to the vertical and a pitch of 2 mm , and the third plane ( collection plane ) is a pcb with horizontal strips with a width of 1 mm and a pitch of 2 mm ; the chamber has a total of 329 channels . in the beginning of the run a maximal drift field of 1.5kv / cm",
    "was applied and had to be reduced later to to 0.3kv / cm because of hv breakdowns . the lorentz angle for a drift field of 0.5kv / cm and a b - field of 0.5 t",
    "was estimated to be @xmath6 .",
    "+ for initial tests without magnetic field , a coincidence of the scintillators was used to trigger on through - going muons ( trigger rate 0.55 hz ) . to trigger on stopping muons ,",
    "the scintillators on top of the cryostat in the bore hole were used , yielding the time @xmath7 of the event needed to determine the drift time , together with the analog sum of 32 channels of the tpc ; the rate was about 1/min .",
    "about 30400 events were collected and visually scanned , and a small sample of 15 @xmath8-electrons and 8 decay positrons from stopped muons were selected for a first analysis @xcite .",
    "this represents a highly biased sample of well measurable events fully contained in the chamber .",

    "a very interesting option to magnetize a lar tpc would be to build a high temperature superconducting ( hts ) solenoid directly in the lar cryostat of the detector .",
    "since the manufacturers deliver data on the temperature dependence of the properties of their commercial hts cables only up to ln@xmath1 temperature ( @xmath10 ) , we performed a small r&d program to investigate the performance of different hts cables also at lar temperature ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
