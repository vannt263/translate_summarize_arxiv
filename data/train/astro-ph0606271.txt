    "since the early work of @xcite on the draco system , dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies in the local group have been suspected to be heavily dark matter ( dm ) dominated .",
    "analyses of dsph internal dynamics under the assumption of virial equilibrium suggest mass contents far exceeding those inferred from their luminosities , with central mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath9 ) ranging from a few to about a hundred ( in solar units ) .",
    "such @xmath9 imply that dsphs have the largest dm fraction of all galaxy types in the universe . yet , despite the wide range of inferred @xmath9 for dsphs , their central velocity dispersions ( @xmath10 ) and half - light radii ( @xmath11 ) seem to be remarkably similar , @xmath12 km s@xmath1 and @xmath13 pc respectively . using these values , typical total dsph masses of a few times @xmath14 m@xmath4",
    "are inferred ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this mass conspiracy seemingly extends to even the very low end of the galaxy luminosity scale .",
    "an early kinematical survey of the dsph in ursa major ( uma ; @xcite ) , the faintest and most diffuse of the known milky way ( mw ) dwarf satellites ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter w05 ) ) , found @xmath10 = 9.3@xmath15 km s@xmath1 , which , coupled with uma s @xmath11 of 250 pc , also results in a mass of @xmath16 m@xmath4 .",
    "recently , a new galactic dsph candidate has been found in the constellation of botes ( ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b06b ) ) during a search for halo substructure using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) data . along with uma , botes ( boo )",
    "is one of the faintest mw satellites found , having ( at a 60 kpc distance ) an absolute magnitude of @xmath17 ( but maybe brighter ; see  3.2 ) .",
    "in addition , the boo dsph exhibits the most irregular density contours of any galactic dsph ( @xcite ) , which suggests that the satellite may be undergoing tidal disruption .    in this letter , we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of boo candidate stars .",
    "we have identified its kinematical signature , which allows us to estimate its systemic velocity , mass and central density , as well as its @xmath9 .",
    "we also use the spectral data to make a rough measurement of the metallicity of boo giant stars .",
    "though @xcite detected boo as an overdensity in sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) , that dataset was proprietary at the time we selected observing targets .",
    "however , boo appears near the northern limit of the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 , @xcite ) as well . because the core of the boo dsph is well within the dr4 coverage area , we select boo candidate stars in the core and southward of declination @xmath1814.8  ( figure 1 ) .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of boo red giant branch ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branch targets with @xmath19 @xmath20 19.0 , as shown in figure 2 , was carried out with the wiyn 3.5-m hydra multi - fiber spectrograph on ut 2006 may 67 .",
    "targets are distributed throughout the @xmath181-degree wiyn+hydra field of view .",
    "the 600@10.1 grating was used with the red fiber cable to yield a wavelength coverage @xmath21 = 45007200   with a spectral resolution of 2.80   per resolution element . to achieve adequate @xmath22 for velocity determination",
    ", we observed one hydra configuration containing 72 boo candidate stars for @xmath23 min .",
    "we also observed 9 radial velocity ( rv ) standards covering spectral types f through m , each through multiple fibers , yielding a total of 64 rv cross - correlation template spectra .",
    "preliminary processing used the _ iraf _ ccdred package , with spectral reduction following the standard dohydra routine .",
    "rvs were derived using the _ iraf _ fxcor task , with each spectrum cross - correlated against all rv standard spectra .",
    "the regions around the h@xmath24 , mg triplet , and h@xmath25 lines were used for cross - correlation . in the end , we measured reliable rvs for 58 of the 72 observed boo candidates .",
    "rv standards ( observed multiple times ) showed deviations from the published iau values for @xmath26 of less than 1 km s@xmath1 on average .",
    "rv uncertainties were determined using the @xcite method , based on analysis of repeatedly observed standard - star spectra .",
    "this technique takes advantage of the fact that the tonry - davis ratio ( tdr , @xcite ) scales with @xmath22 , so that individual rv uncertainties may be found via : @xmath27 , where @xmath24 is determined from the standards . for our set of 64 standards , we measure @xmath24 = 107 , which yields an average velocity uncertainty of @xmath18 4.0 km s@xmath1 ( tdr @xmath28 25 , with typical @xmath22 of 15 - 20 ) .",
    "with our rv data alone , the signal of boo stars is not clear . to improve the contrast of boo stars with respect to mw contaminants , we make use of the gravity sensitive mgh absorption feature near 5150    to remove foreground galactic dwarfs , as we have done photometrically in our previous dsph studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because the mgh absorption is very strong in all but the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath29 -2 ) k  dwarf stars , visual inspection alone is sufficient to  clean \" our spectroscopic sample of the majority of foreground dwarfs by simply identifying those with strong mgh features , like the one shown in fig .  4 ( see also fig .  1 in @xcite for an illustration ) .    to further clean this sample",
    ", we make use of instrumental lick spectroscopic indices ( @xcite ) .",
    "a proper determination of stellar @xmath30 , log @xmath19 and [ fe / h ] values based on lick indices is beyond the purpose here .",
    "instead , we identify stars with similar metal line strengths using the quantitative indices of the lick system .",
    "figure 3a shows the mg@xmath31 + mg@xmath32 versus mg @xmath33 trend for all stars visually classified as likely giants with rv uncertainties less than 7.5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "figure 3b shows their rv distribution as a function of radial distance from the nominal center of boo .",
    "we have marked those having relatively low and high mg indices with circles and squares respectively .",
    "we also mark with asterisks a group of stars clumped in @xmath26 ( @xmath34 km s@xmath1 in fig.3b ) and mg strength .",
    "these stars have velocities compatible with those expected for debris from the leading arm of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dsph ( @xcite ) ; because boo lies in the background of the sgr leading arm ( see fig . 1 in @xcite )",
    ", giant stars with these rvs are not unexpected in our sample .",
    "figure 3b shows that within the @xmath11 of boo the distribution of stars shows a distinct grouping of giant stars with low mg indices and @xmath35 km s@xmath1 .",
    "such a velocity grouping is unexpected for a random halo population at this galactic position , and is clearly distinct from the distribution of stars beyond @xmath11 , which is centered at 0 km s@xmath1 ( the nominal mean velocity for any mw stellar population at this galactic longitude ) .",
    "a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the populations inside and outside 13   are drawn from different rv distributions with a probability greater than 99.99% .",
    "thus , we identify this group of rv - clumped stars within 13   with the boo dsph .",
    "this  cleaner \" rv distribution inside @xmath11 helps us define a membership criterion to identify boo stars .",
    "we first draw attention to the broadening of the rv distribution beyond @xmath36 .",
    "this behavior might be expected if boo is undergoing tidal stripping , as its distorted morphology suggests .",
    "models of tidally disrupting satellites predict a rising velocity dispersion at large radii ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a trend that is also observed in a number of other galactic dsphs : ursa minor ( umi , @xcite ) , sculptor ( @xcite ) , carina ( @xcite ) , fornax ( @xcite ) , sextans ( @xcite ) and leo i ( @xcite ) . because of the broadening of the rv distribution",
    ", we conservatively use the innermost seven stars to define a 3@xmath37 ( see  3.2 ) rv criterion for membership of @xmath38 km s@xmath1 .",
    "twelve stars lie within this velocity range , all with low mg line strengths , the most widely separated ( within our survey ) at 27   to the south of the boo center .",
    "two likely giants at higher velocity than our 3@xmath37 rv limit are seen in figure 3b .",
    "they lie right in the narrow rgb of boo ( see fig .",
    "2 where they are marked with open circles ) and the strength of their mg features makes them consistent with being boo members ; these stars suggest a possibly dramatic increase of the boo velocity dispersion with radius .      using the innermost seven stars to define the properties of the boo core rv distribution",
    "gives a systemic velocity of @xmath0 km s@xmath1 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath2 km s@xmath1 , calculated using the maximum likelihood method ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this @xmath26 translates into a @xmath39 km s@xmath1 , implying that boo is likely not in a circular orbit , but in a rather radial one .",
    "including all twelve potential @xmath40 members in the calculation yields @xmath41 km s@xmath1 and @xmath42 km s@xmath1 ; the latter corroborating the apparent increase of the velocity dispersion with radius . if we include the two likely high velocity members that lie above the 3@xmath37 rv limit (  3.1 ) , we obtain @xmath43 km s@xmath1 .    as is customary for this type of study , one can use the observed @xmath10 to estimate the mass content in the boo dsph under the assumption that it is in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "while this assumption has been a matter of some debate , it has been shown ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; muoz et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "that unless the satellite is completely destroyed or near complete destruction , the value of @xmath10 indeed reflects the instantaneous mass content . from @xcite ,",
    "the total mass of the dsph system can be approximated by : @xmath44 , where @xmath25 is a correction parameter dependent on the concentration value , @xmath45 is the geometric - mean king core radius in pc , and @xmath46 is a parameter related to @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite approximates @xmath47 and @xmath48 for pressure - supported systems that follow low concentration king models , as dsphs do .",
    "we can further approximate @xmath45 to @xmath11 derived by @xcite ( 13 , corresponding to 225 pc at a distance of 60 kpc ) . with @xmath2 km s@xmath1 we obtain @xmath49 m@xmath4 .",
    "we can also estimate the central mass density in boo as @xmath50 @xcite ; this yields @xmath51 pc@xmath52 .",
    "these results are remarkably similar to the values obtained for the majority of the galactic dsphs .",
    "@xcite points out that local group dsph systems seem to be embedded in dm halos of @xmath53 m@xmath4 regardless of the contribution of their luminous component .",
    "he further finds the following empirical relation between the @xmath9 and the total luminosity of a dsph : @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "adopting an absolute magnitude for boo of @xmath55 ( from @xcite ) yields a total luminosity of @xmath56 l@xmath4 , which , in turn , gives @xmath57 ( m / l)@xmath4 .",
    "we note that this luminosity would make boo even fainter than uma if we adopt for the latter the absolute magnitude estimate of @xmath58 from @xcite .",
    "a visual comparison of the cmds of boo and uma reveals that the boo rgb contains at least a factor of two more stars than that of uma ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since they have comparable half - light radii , this implies that boo must be at least twice as bright as uma .",
    "were we to adopt the @xcite estimate for the uma @xmath59 , this yields a total luminosity for boo of @xmath60 l@xmath4 , making @xmath61 . with either of these values , however , boo lies squarely on the @xcite relation .",
    "the mg i triplet+mgh absorption features near 5150    can be exploited to estimate the boo [ fe / h ] .",
    "we have already shown ( fig .",
    "3 ) that boo stars exhibit by far the weakest mg features of all likely giant stars in our sample .",
    "we have used the ctio 4-m telescope + the hydra multifiber spectrograph , with a comparable instrument setup ( yielding similar spectral resolution ) to that used for the boo observations , for rv measurements of red giant candidates in the globular clusters ( gcs ) ngc 288 and ngc 5634 ( moskowitz et al . , in prep .",
    "these clusters have [ fe / h ] of @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively ( @xcite ) and we use them as metallicity calibrators , selecting for this purpose giant stars that are confirmed rv cluster members . in order to minimize the effect of surface gravity and temperature in the measurements of equivalent width ( ew ) of the mg features , we pick and combine the spectra of stars that lie in the upper part of their respective red giant branches , which provides bright members with fairly similar colors .",
    "figure 4 shows the combined spectra obtained for the two clusters and for boo .",
    "we then add the ews for the three mg lines to compensate for the weakness of the mg features , and assume a linear function between this sum and [ fe / h ] and [ fe / h ] is not unreasonable for [ fe / h ] @xmath64 . ] . using this derived relationship and assuming a similar [ mg / fe ] ratio between the gc and boo stars @xmath65 ) have comparable [ @xmath24/fe ] to galactic gc stars .",
    "] , we translate the ews measured for boo into an extrapolated [ fe / h ] of @xmath66 .",
    "the uncertainties in the ew measurements translate into uncertainties in [ fe / h ] of about 0.2 dex .",
    "this does not include , of course , the error introduced by assuming a linear relationship between ews and [ fe / h ] in the first place , nor the uncertainties due to surface gravity , temperature effects , or possible variations in @xmath24-element abundances between the gcs and boo .    these calculations ,",
    "although only intended to provide a very rough estimation of the metallicity of boo , are consistent with the [ fe / h ] = @xmath67 derived by @xcite using rr lyrae variables , and with the fact that the boo rgb seems to be slightly bluer than that of m92 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath68 ; see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "boo is potentially the most metal poor of the galactic dsphs known to date .",
    "we spectroscopically survey the boo dsph and derive both its systemic velocity ( @xmath69 km s@xmath1 ) and central velocity dispersion ( @xmath70 km s@xmath1 ) , which yields a mass of @xmath49 m@xmath4 .",
    "this mass is similar to that of the other dsph galaxies and puts boo squarely on the  same mass - just different luminosities \" trend identified by @xcite , despite the fact that boo is one of the faintest known galactic satellites .",
    "the dynamical mass derived for boo , taken at face value , implies that this is possibly also the darkest dsph known to date . if other systems of similar luminosity have the same mass , the current pace of discovery of these systems ( three in the past year",
    "; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )  and in only the approximately 20% of the sky covered by the sdss dr5  will help alleviate the current order of magnitude or two deficit of known galactic satellites compared to that predicted by @xmath71cdm simulations , albeit only for one part of the mass spectrum exhibiting the apparent  missing satellites \" shortfall ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while boo seems to be the most dm dominated dwarf , it is , at the same time , the galactic satellite with the most distorted known morphology ( @xcite ) and possibly most dramatic increase in velocity dispersion with radius .",
    "this implies that boo may be among the most disrupted galactic dwarfs , to the extent that it even lacks a proper core ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact a puzzling correlation is now emerging between the dm fraction of a dsph and its morphology , wherein the faintest and most distorted systems ( the umi , uma and boo dsphs ) seem also to present the largest central @xmath9 s .",
    "if the distorted contours are a response to the influence of galactic tides , and if all dsphs indeed have a similar current total mass and density , then why is it that tides seem to affect preferentially the least luminous systems ? perhaps these faintest systems represent the @xcite regime in which disruption has proceeded to the point where the central velocity dispersions are inflated by tides , artificially increasing the derived @xmath9 . but even if so , then it is curious that the current @xmath10 for boo would be inflated to just such a value that the derived ( but artificial ) dynamical mass still participates in the  same mass \" conspiracy of dsph galaxies .",
