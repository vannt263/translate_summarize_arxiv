    "jets and other outflows are commonly observed from young stellar objects , interacting binary stars and active galactic nuclei .",
    "it is generally believed that the outflows are produced by the accretion disks in these systems .",
    "the widely differing properties of the central objects in these systems suggest that a mechanism may be at work that is largely independent of the nature of the central object ( e.g. livio 1997 ) .",
    "a particularly promising mechanism for the acceleration and collimation of outflows involves a large - scale poloidal magnetic field that threads the disk .",
    "the influential model of blandford & payne ( 1982 ) established the significance of the angle of inclination , @xmath1 , of the poloidal magnetic field lines to the vertical at the surface of the disk . when @xmath2 , matter that is just above the surface , being forced to corotate with the foot - point of the field line ,",
    "is accelerated outwards along it by the centrifugal force . at greater distances , the flow may collimate into a jet by magnetic hoop stresses or poloidal collimation .",
    "a clear review of the physics of magnetocentrifugally driven outflows has been given by spruit ( 1996 ) .",
    "several groups have performed axisymmetric numerical simulations of outflows using this mechanism ( e.g.  ustyugova et al .",
    "1995 ; romanova et  al .  1997 ; ustyugova et  al .  1999 ; ouyed & pudritz 1997a , 1997b , 1999 ; krasnopolsky , li , & blandford 1999 ) . like the model of blandford & payne ( 1982 ) , these calculations do not resolve the vertical structure of the disk but treat it as a boundary surface that loads mass at a specified rate on to the magnetic field lines .",
    "while these simulations have convincingly demonstrated some aspects of the magnetocentrifugal model of jet production , several fundamental issues remain to be resolved . in this paper , we will attempt to address two of these questions .",
    "first , what determines the rate of mass loss in the outflow ?",
    "how does this depend on the strength and inclination of the magnetic field , or on other properties of the disk ?",
    "second , what is the long - term evolution of a large - scale magnetic field in a disk ?",
    "is it possible to assemble a magnetic configuration suitable for jet launching , or to maintain it against dissipation ?",
    "a proper understanding of these issues is essential if we are to explain the conditions that regulate the production of astrophysical jets .",
    "the magnetocentrifugal mechanism can explain the acceleration of outflows even when the matter is ` cold ' in the sense that the temperature is much less than the virial temperature or escape temperature .",
    "however , as mentioned by blandford & payne ( 1982 ) and calculated in detail by ogilvie ( 1997 ) and by ogilvie & livio ( 1998 ; hereafter paper  i ) , some amount of thermal assistance is still required to overcome the potential barrier between the surface and the slow magnetosonic point ( ` sonic point ' ) .",
    "the barrier occurs because the field lines are not straight inside the disk and the angular velocity deviates slightly from the keplerian value because of the radial lorentz force associated with the bending of the field lines ( shu 1991 ; wardle & knigl 1993 ) . a proper calculation of the vertical structure of the disk , including these effects , is therefore required in order to determine the height of the potential barrier and the rate of mass loss in the outflow .",
    "indeed , it is obvious from the well - known properties of transonic outflows that the mass loss rate depends on the physical conditions below the sonic point , and that the vertical structure must therefore be resolved .",
    "in paper  i we carried out such a calculation for disks that are rather strongly magnetized in the sense that the magnetorotational instability , which leads to turbulence in accretion disks ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) , is suppressed or nearly so .",
    "we assumed that the magnetic field enforces strict isorotation and showed that the potential barrier increases very steeply as the field is made stronger and the disk becomes more sub - keplerian .",
    "this effect would suppress outflows from strongly magnetized disks unless an additional source of energy , such as coronal heating , were present ( in accord with the suggestion made by livio 1997 ) .",
    "a disadvantage of the calculation in paper  i is that no explanation was given for the source of the effective viscosity of a disk in which the magnetorotational instability is suppressed .",
    "the solutions did not extend to field strengths much below the stability boundary .",
    "when the field is weaker than this , it can not be expected to enforce isorotation , and the model requires some modification .",
    "in addition , the effect of the turbulence on the mean magnetic field should be modeled , most simply through the introduction of an effective magnetic diffusivity .    however , the presence of a turbulent diffusivity may cause problems for the magnetocentrifugal mechanism .",
    "the analysis by lubow , papaloizou , & pringle ( 1994a ) suggests that , if the effective magnetic prandtl number of the disk is of order unity , as might be expected , it is impossible to sustain a steady configuration with a significantly inclined field in a thin disk ( see also heyvaerts , priest , & bardou 1996 ; reyes - ruiz & stepinski 1996 ) .",
    "although the accretion flow tends to drag magnetic flux inwards , the turbulent diffusivity expels flux faster if the inclination is large .",
    "the inclination angle in a steady state is then expected to be comparable to the angular semi - thickness @xmath3 of the disk .",
    "this constraint can be avoided if the accretion flow is due primarily to the loss of angular momentum in an outflow , and might also be relieved by a dynamo operating in the disk if special conditions are met ( campbell , papaloizou , & agapitou 1998 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore a model for the vertical structure of magnetized disks .",
    "we will extend the analysis of paper  i to allow for the possibility of more weakly magnetized disks in which there is turbulence , and strict isorotation does not hold .",
    "we will also give a better treatment of the matching between the disk and the atmosphere by applying photospheric boundary conditions , allowing us to calculate the mass loss rate in the outflow explicitly .",
    "at the same time , we will solve for the rate of dragging of magnetic flux and thereby refine the previous estimates which may have been based on oversimple arguments .",
    "related calculations of the vertical structure of magnetized disks , and of the disk - jet connection , have been made by knigl ( 1989 ) , wardle & knigl ( 1993 ) , li ( 1995 , 1996 ) , ferreira ( 1997 ) , campbell ( 1999 ) , casse & ferreira ( 2000 ) , and shalybkov & rdiger ( 2000 ) .",
    "our method and results are significantly different from all previous calculations and comparisons of the relevant issues will be made towards the end of this paper .",
    "to set this calculation in its proper context , we consider here some of the wider issues relating to magnetized accretion disks and outflows .    for a thin disk without a large - scale magnetic field ,",
    "there is a clear division of the physical problem into two aspects .",
    "first , a model is required for the local vertical structure at any given radius @xmath4 and time @xmath5 .",
    "such a model takes the surface mass density @xmath6 as a parameter and predicts quantities such as the vertically integrated viscous stress @xmath7 . the vertical structure may be assumed to be stationary on the dynamical time - scale .",
    "second , the one - dimensional conservation equations for mass and angular momentum determine how @xmath8 evolves on the viscous time - scale , given the local relation between @xmath7 and @xmath6 ( e.g. lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) .",
    "for a disk with a large - scale poloidal magnetic field but no outflows ( e.g. a polytrope with a force - free or vacuum exterior ) , the situation is similar but more complicated .",
    "now the local vertical structure at a given radius depends not only on @xmath6 but also on the vertical magnetic field @xmath9 and the inclination angle @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to an evolutionary equation for @xmath6 , there is a one - dimensional conservation equation for magnetic flux , which determines how the flux function @xmath10 evolves on the viscous time - scale .",
    "@xmath9 is simply related to the radial derivative of @xmath11 .",
    "finally , the force - free magnetic equilibrium in the exterior of the disk leads to a global relation between @xmath11 and the inclination angle @xmath1 .",
    "the full problem therefore involves an integro - differential equation .",
    "this has been considered by lubow et al .",
    "( 1994a ) , although they did not examine the effect of the magnetic field on the vertical disk structure .",
    "when outflows occur along the magnetic field lines , further couplings exist .",
    "the exterior magnetic field is modified from the force - free solution by the inertial forces associated with the outflow .",
    "this effect depends on the amount of mass loading , and is therefore coupled to the launching problem .",
    "the exterior field is no longer purely poloidal but becomes significantly twisted beyond the alfvn surface , although non - axisymmetric ( e.g. kink ) instabilities may set in here ( e.g. spruit , foglizzo , & stehle 1997 ) .",
    "this part of the solution is established on the alfvn travel time to the alfvn surface , which is comparable to the dynamical time - scale of the disk . finally , the mass loss and especially the angular momentum loss in the outflow feed back into the evolutionary equations for the disk .",
    "the full problem therefore involves three aspects : the local vertical structure of the disk and the launching problem ; the global structure of the exterior magnetic field and the dynamics of the outflow along those field lines ; and the evolution of mass , angular momentum , and magnetic flux on a longer time - scale .",
    "the first aspect is the subject of this paper , while the second aspect is well described by some of the numerical simulations referred to above .",
    "the third aspect has been considered implicitly in steady models such as that of casse & ferreira ( 2000 ) , but the development of a complete evolutionary scheme for mass , angular momentum and magnetic flux in the general , non - steady case remains a challenge ( see lovelace , newman , & romanova 1997 for a simplified version of such a scheme ) .",
    "there has been some confusion in the literature regarding the interplay between these aspects of the problem .",
    "for example , studies of the launching problem have often imposed the condition that the poloidal magnetic flux should not migrate radially ( e.g. knigl 1989 ; li 1995 ) .",
    "that is , there should be an instantaneous balance between inward advection of flux by the accretion flow , and outward transport due to turbulent , ohmic , or ambipolar diffusion .",
    "this may not always be appropriate because the migration occurs on the viscous time - scale , whereas the solution of the launching problem need only be stationary on the dynamical time - scale . in wardle & knigl ( 1993 ) the rate of flux migration",
    "was treated as a free parameter .",
    "moreover , some of these studies appear to predict the value of the toroidal magnetic field at the surface of the disk , @xmath12 , even when the dynamics of the outflow beyond the sonic point has not been considered ( e.g. campbell 1999 ) or when there is no outflow ( e.g. shalybkov & rdiger 2000 ) .",
    "this is unsatisfactory because @xmath12 determines the external magnetic torque acting on the disk , which certainly depends on the dynamics of the outflow in the trans - alfvnic region .",
    "these incorrectly specified studies may be motivated by the fact that the model of blandford & payne ( 1982 ) appears to require @xmath12 to be determined by the disk ( through their parameter @xmath13 ) . however , this is misleading and may be attributed to the fact that the blandford & payne model is underconstrained because it is missing a boundary condition at large distances from the disk ( cf .",
    "ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "indeed , solutions of their model generically behave unphysically at large distances without having passed through the modified fast magnetosonic point . in contrast , krasnopolsky et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) have given a clear discussion of which quantities may or may not be specified as boundary conditions when treating the disk as a boundary surface . in their model @xmath12 is determined by the outflow , not by the disk .    in our local study , therefore , we will not impose the constraint of zero flux migration ; rather , we will impose the value of @xmath14 and determine the rate of flux migration .",
    "usually we will specify @xmath15 , meaning that the outflow is absent or exerts only a weak torque .",
    "efficient magnetocentrifugal outflows are expected to have @xmath16 , with the toroidal field becoming comparable to the poloidal component only at greater distances from the source , where the alfvn surface is located ( spruit 1996 ) .",
    "as noted above , an important investigation of the evolution of the poloidal magnetic flux was made by lubow et  al .",
    "( 1994a ) , who concluded that , if the disk is turbulent , with an effective magnetic prandtl number of order unity , the accretion flow will be almost entirely ineffective in dragging in magnetic flux .",
    "this can be explained by noting that the effective magnetic reynolds number of the accretion flow , based on the disk thickness @xmath17 , is small , of order @xmath3 ( heyvaerts et  al .",
    "similar arguments suggest that a configuration in which the field lines are bent significantly from the vertical ( e.g.  to achieve @xmath2 ) can not be sustained on the viscous time - scale .",
    "these arguments are based on a kinematic analysis of the magnetic induction equation in which the radial velocity and magnetic diffusivity are prescribed quantities .",
    "they also depend on a simple order - of - magnitude treatment of the vertical structure of the magnetic field . in this paper",
    "we will present a numerical treatment of a set of equations , including the induction equation , in which the radial velocity is self - consistently determined .",
    "this is important because , in a jet - launching configuration , the magnetic field must become dynamically dominant above some height and will then control the radial velocity .",
    "we will find results that differ significantly from the estimates of lubow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) under some circumstances . before presenting the numerical model",
    ", we therefore reconsider the problem of the induction equation from an analytical viewpoint .",
    "we assume that the mean poloidal magnetic field is axisymmetric and may be described by a flux function @xmath18 such that @xmath19 for a thin disk containing a bending poloidal field of dipolar symmetry , the flux function has the form ( ogilvie 1997 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "then @xmath22 and @xmath9 are comparable in magnitude if @xmath23 . the flux content of the disk is determined essentially by @xmath24 , while @xmath25 allows for bending of the field lines within the disk .",
    "we assume that the mean magnetic field in a turbulent disk may be treated within the framework of mean - field electrodynamics ( e.g.   moffatt 1978 ) . in the absence of a mean - field dynamo effect ( or in the absence of a toroidal field ) , the flux function then satisfies the mean induction equation , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mean velocity and @xmath28 the turbulent magnetic diffusivity . in a thin disk",
    "the dominant terms are @xmath29 the neglected terms are all smaller than those retained because @xmath21 and @xmath30 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side is also sometimes neglected ( e.g. lubow et al .",
    "1994a ) .",
    "although this equation appears to be an evolutionary equation for @xmath24 it should be observed that the equation is defined for all values of @xmath31 whereas @xmath24 is a function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 only .",
    "moreover , the equation is not closed because of the term involving @xmath25 .",
    "following lubow et al .",
    "( 1994a ) , we might attempt to close the equation by vertical averaging . conventionally in accretion - disk theory one uses density - weighted averages @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the density and @xmath36 is the surface density , the integrals being over the full vertical extent of the disk .",
    "the density - weighted average @xmath32 is particularly appropriate because it is directly related to the mass accretion rate .",
    "the vertical average of the induction equation is then @xmath37 lubow et al",
    ". proceeded by approximating the last term as @xmath38 .",
    "this closes the equation because @xmath39 , which is proportional to the vertically integrated toroidal electric current , can be globally related to the flux function by considering the force balance exterior to the disk .",
    "if the exterior region is treated either as an insulating vacuum , or as a force - free medium with vanishing @xmath40 , the exterior poloidal field is potential .",
    "this leads to a global relation of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a certain linear integral operator ( see also ogilvie 1997 ) .",
    "this order - of - magnitude estimate of the final term appears reasonable if the field lines bend mainly in the densest layers of the disc near the midplane .",
    "however , the term might be significantly overestimated if the bending occurs mainly in the upper layers of the disk where @xmath43 is likely to be considerably smaller .",
    "another way of averaging the induction equation reinforces this concern .",
    "if the equation is divided by @xmath28 and integrated with respect to @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 now the precise shape of the field line has truly been eliminated in favor of @xmath39 .",
    "this therefore appears to be the ` correct ' way of averaging the equation .",
    "however , we are now faced with vertical averages of @xmath48 and @xmath28 weighted by @xmath49 , not by @xmath35 . even if @xmath28 is independent of @xmath31 , these could be significantly different from the density - weighted averages , leading to different conclusions about flux dragging .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , the presence of the magnetic field will in general change the vertical profiles of @xmath48 and @xmath28 .",
    "if the field is extremely weak so that the induction equation may be treated ` kinematically ' , then the @xmath49 averaging method is surely the correct one .",
    "however , the vertical profile of @xmath48 , in particular , is determined by subtle effects ( e.g. kley & lin 1992 ) and is easily distorted by even weak lorentz forces . in this case",
    "we can not obtain a closed equation because @xmath50 can not be determined from a knowledge of the mass accretion rate .",
    "the essential difficulty is that , while @xmath32 is the relevant mean velocity for mass accretion , @xmath50 is the appropriate mean for flux accretion",
    ". these could be significantly disparate and could even differ in sign .",
    "the above discussion shows that the only solution to this problem is to solve explicitly for the vertical structure of the disk including the physics that determines the vertical profile of the radial velocity .",
    "we now consider the set of equations governing the local vertical structure of a disk containing a mean poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the equations of paper  i will be augmented by the inclusion of additional physical effects .",
    "the angular velocity is written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the keplerian value , and @xmath53 .",
    "the flux function is written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and we approximate @xmath54 so that @xmath9 is independent of @xmath31 .    the required equations may be approximated as follows .",
    "the radial component of the equation of motion is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the permeability of free space .",
    "the azimuthal component is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the vertical component is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the pressure .",
    "the poloidal part of the induction equation is @xmath61 the toroidal part is @xmath62 the energy equation is @xmath63 ,    \\label{energy}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the radiative energy flux , with @xmath65 the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath66 the temperature , and @xmath67 the rosseland mean opacity .    these equations must be supplemented by constitutive relations specifying the equation of state , the opacity , the viscosity , and the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "we will adopt the ideal - gas equation of state , @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath70 the mean molecular mass , and @xmath71 the mass of the hydrogen atom ) , and a generic power - law opacity , @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are constants .",
    "this includes the cases of thomson scattering opacity ( @xmath76 ) and kramers opacity ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) .",
    "the viscosity is less certain , and we will adopt the standard prescription @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a dimensionless constant . for the magnetic diffusivity , we assume that the magnetic prandtl number , @xmath81 is constant",
    ".    we will further assume either that @xmath80 is a fixed parameter ( ` _ fixed alpha hypothesis _ ' ) , or that @xmath80 can adjust so as to keep the equilibrium at marginal magnetorotational stability , as explained in section  4.8 below ( ` _ marginal stability hypothesis _ ' ) .",
    "several terms in the equations have been omitted on the grounds that the disk is thin and the solution should be stationary on the dynamical time - scale ( although not necessarily on the viscous time - scale ) .",
    "the radial pressure gradient , the vertical variation of radial gravity , and the inertial terms associated with the meridional flow , have been neglected as usual . however ,",
    "enough terms have been retained to determine the profile of radial velocity in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "generally , @xmath82 has been neglected relative to @xmath83 , and @xmath25 relative to @xmath24 , except where physically essential .",
    "it has also been assumed that the viscosity does not act on the shear components @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "such terms are expected to be relatively unimportant in most cases of interest , and it was found that the inclusion of these terms increases the order of the differential system and makes it difficult to obtain a solution .",
    "it is especially unclear how to connect a viscous disk to an inviscid atmosphere , when these terms are included , without introducing an artificial boundary layer .",
    "we did not include a dynamo alpha - effect in the equations for the mean magnetic field . although there is no difficulty in principle in doing so ,",
    "this effect is even less well understood than the turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity , and we chose to avoid this additional complication in the present study .    finally , in the energy equation ( [ energy ] )",
    "it has been assumed that the heat generated in each annulus is radiated away locally and not advected through the disk .",
    "the equations of section  4.1 describe the local vertical structure of an accretion disk with a mean poloidal magnetic field . when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions ,",
    "as described below , they constitute a problem similar in type to a stellar structure calculation , although the details are of course very different .",
    "obviously it is possible in principle to include a more detailed equation of state , accurate opacity tables , a more sophisticated approach to radiative transfer , and further possibilities such as convective energy transport .",
    "however , the principal uncertainties concern the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity .    in fact , these equations are not strictly local in radius and time because some radial derivatives and one time - derivative remain .",
    "the case of @xmath86 is trivial .",
    "the terms @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the poloidal part of the induction equation are retained in order to determine whether the magnetic flux migrates inwards ( @xmath89 ) or outwards as a result of the local disk solution .",
    "the gradient @xmath88 can affect this result because it contributes to the diffusion of flux .",
    "therefore @xmath88 appears as a parameter of the local model and @xmath87 as an eigenvalue ; note that both are independent of @xmath31 .",
    "the case of @xmath90 is more problematic .",
    "this viscous term is retained in the angular momentum equation because it partially determines the radial velocity , which in turn causes radial advection of magnetic flux and also affects the shape of the field lines , at least when the field is weak .",
    "this term may be approximated by arguing that @xmath91 in the neighborhood of the radius under consideration , where @xmath92 is the vertically integrated dynamic viscosity , @xmath17 the semi - thickness , and @xmath93 an undetermined dimensionless function . under this assumption ,",

    "the solution extends up to a photospheric surface @xmath101 at which it is matched to a simple atmospheric model , discussed below .",
    "the photospheric boundary conditions are @xmath102 and @xmath103 where the subscript ` s ' denotes a surface value .",
    "we also have @xmath104 there , where @xmath39 and @xmath12 are assigned values which , physically , are determined by the solution of the global exterior outflow problem ( not considered here ) .    with these boundary conditions the equation of angular momentum conservation , obtained from a vertical integration of equation ( [ motion_phi ] ) , has the form @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the mass accretion rate , not necessarily constant .",
    "this shows the contributions to angular momentum transport from magnetic and viscous torques .",
    "the solution is determined as follows .",
    "one guesses the values of the quantities @xmath17 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "this fixes the atmospheric model and determines @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath12 are given .",
    "one must further guess @xmath87 to start the downward integration .",
    "the three guessed quantities should be adjusted to match the three symmetry conditions on @xmath100 .",

    "the magnitudes of the turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are determined by the prescribed value of @xmath80 .",
    "a problem with this approach , as will be seen in the next section , is that equilibrium solutions can then be obtained that are magnetorotationally unstable even when the effect of the turbulent diffusivity on stability is taken into account .",
    "this suggests that the model may be physically inconsistent for these examples , because the ` channel solution ' ( hawley & balbus 1991 ) would continue to grow exponentially .",
    "furthermore , there is a close connection between the stability of the equilibria and properties such as the shape of the field lines ( ogilvie 1998 )",
    ". we will find solutions that we believe to be unstable , in which the field lines bend more than once , and which have other undesirable properties .",
    "a resolution of these difficulties is suggested by the numerical simulations of magnetorotational turbulence , which indicate that _ the turbulence is much more vigorous in the presence of a mean poloidal magnetic field _ ( hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 ) , provided that the field is not so strong as to suppress the instability .",
    "indeed , stone et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found it impossible to run a simulation in a stratified disk with a net vertical field , while miller & stone ( 2000 ) found a dramatic difference between simulations with no net field and those with a fairly weak uniform vertical field .    in an effort to understand and model this behavior , we propose the following physical hypothesis for turbulent disks with a mean field : _ the value of @xmath80 adjusts so that the equilibrium is marginally stable to the magnetorotational instability when the turbulent magnetic diffusivity is taken into account_. we remark that a similar situation occurs in stellar convection , where an equivalent hypothesis can be used as a basis for the mixing - length theory . in a further example of this approach , kippenhahn & thomas ( 1978 ) modeled the outcome of a shear instability by imposing marginal stability according to the richardson criterion .",
    "when the mean poloidal magnetic field is very weak , the instability favors small length scales and only a small value of @xmath80 is required to suppress it . for stronger fields ,",
    "the required value of @xmath80 will be larger .",
    "for even stronger fields with @xmath161 on the mid - plane , the instability is suppressed or nearly so even without any diffusivity , and @xmath80 will be small or zero .",
    "this variation of @xmath80 with the strength of the mean poloidal field is qualitatively in agreement with that found in numerical simulations ( hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 ; brandenburg 1998 ) , suggesting that our physical hypothesis is reasonable .",
    "however , our model will require this hypothesis to extend into a parameter range that can not be ( or at least has not been ) reproduced in numerical simulations of stratified disks .",
    "although a magnetorotationally unstable disk may contain numerous unstable modes , it has been argued by ogilvie ( 1998 ) that , in ideal mhd , the last mode to be stabilized is an axisymmetric mode with vanishing radial wavenumber ( i.e. @xmath162 rather than @xmath163 ) , and is the first mode of odd symmetry about the mid - plane .",
    "marginal stability of the annulus is then imposed by locating the marginal stability condition for this critical mode .",
    "we conjecture that this remains true when dissipation is included .    from a consideration of the linearized equations in the limit of vanishing eigenfrequency",
    ", we find that such a mode should involve only horizontal motions and satisfy the horizontal components of the perturbed equation of motion , @xmath164 @xmath165 and the perturbed induction equation , @xmath166 @xmath167 where @xmath168 denotes a linearized eulerian perturbation .",
    "these equations should be compared with the unperturbed equations ( [ motion_r])([motion_phi ] ) and ( [ induction_rz])([induction_phi ] ) .",
    "note that this problem is different from the marginal stability problem considered in paper  i , where the magnetic diffusivity was zero .",
    "the critical mode is expected to be the first mode of odd symmetry about the mid - plane ( ogilvie 1998 ) .",
    "this should satisfy the symmetry conditions @xmath169 on the mid - plane , and the photospheric boundary conditions @xmath170 ( since @xmath39 and @xmath12 are fixed in the local model ) .",

    "however , the equilibrium will not in general possess a marginal mode satisfying the correct boundary conditions . by integrating the equations for a marginal mode simultaneously with those defining the equilibrium , we aim to tune @xmath80 until a marginal mode is obtained .",
    "if this mode is the first mode of odd symmetry , we then believe we have determined the value of @xmath80 corresponding to a marginally stable equilibrium .    a crude estimate of this may be obtained by approximating the second derivative with respect to @xmath153 as @xmath174 .",
    "this leads to the estimate @xmath175 which has the properties described above .",
    "it might be argued that our marginal stability condition is too strong because the presence of one or two unstable modes of relatively long radial wavelength might not contribute significantly to turbulent transport .",
    "however , if the critical mode is not stabilized , it will lead to the growth of the fundamental ` channel solution ' , which is very efficient in transporting angular momentum and probably hydrodynamically unstable in three dimensions , leading to enhanced turbulence .",
    "admittedly , the description of the disk under these circumstances is a matter of some uncertainty .",

    "the illustrative accretion rate is @xmath220 , which is less than the eddington accretion rate @xmath221 for an accretion efficiency of @xmath222 .",
    "the profile of radial velocity is of particular interest , since this will affect the advection of the magnetic field .",
    "the radial velocity is _ positive _ on the mid - plane and becomes negative at larger @xmath31 , the density - weighted average being of course negative .",
    "this result has been found previously by several authors ( e.g.  urpin 1984 ; kley & lin 1992 , where further analysis of this phenomenon may be found ) . in the present model it results from the vertical profile of the viscosity , specifically from the @xmath223 term in equation ( [ ur ] ) .",
    "we first adopt the fixed alpha hypothesis and search for magnetized solutions , taking parameter values @xmath203 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 in addition to @xmath76 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and the illustrative values for @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "there are two limits in which physically acceptable solutions are easily obtained over a wide range of inclination angles : very weak fields , and strong fields .",
    "we illustrate two such cases , with @xmath227 , in figs  2 and  3 .    in the very weakly magnetized solutions , the magnetic field behaves kinematically and the equilibrium structure of the unmagnetized solution is not significantly distorted ( e.g.  the radial velocity profile is almost indistinguishable from that in the unmagnetized solution ) .",
    "the poloidal field lines bend smoothly according to a balance between advection and diffusion .",
    "isorotation is not enforced ( there is only a minuscule deviation from keplerian rotation ) and the field is strongly wound up ( @xmath228 ) in the example shown , with @xmath227 .",
    "the poloidal field lines continue to bend as the photosphere is approached .",
    "this is permitted because @xmath229 is very large throughout . our atmospheric model , which assumed @xmath230 , is not relevant here and certainly the outflow solution should be disregarded .",
    "it is not clear how to treat the atmosphere in a case such a this , because it is not understood whether the radial flow and magnetic diffusivity continue above the photosphere .    by setting @xmath15",
    ", we have ensured that the radial mass flux is caused by viscosity alone ( cf .",
    ".  [ [ am ] ] ) .",
    "as expected , the radial velocity causes the flux to migrate inwards for almost vertical fields , but outwards for larger inclination angles . with @xmath225 and @xmath226 ,",
    "one finds the intermediate case @xmath231 at @xmath232 .",
    "this is much larger than @xmath218 , indicating that our concerns expressed in section  3 were well founded .",
    "alternatively , one can prevent the flux from being expelled ( i.e.  achieve @xmath231 ) when @xmath227 by increasing @xmath111 from @xmath233 to @xmath234 .",
    "increasing @xmath235 does not change @xmath187 significantly .    for strong fields ,",
    "we recover solutions very similar to those we obtained in paper  i. in the example shown in fig .  3",
    ", the disk is significantly compressed by the lorentz force ( compare the plot of @xmath178 with the unmagnetized case ) , and is hotter ( cf .",
    "@xmath179 ) and more luminous ( cf .",
    "@xmath180 ) than its unmagnetized counterpart .",
    "most of the bending of the poloidal field lines occurs near the mid - plane where @xmath229 is close to unity .",
    "the field enforces isorotation , resulting in sub - keplerian rotation , and very little toroidal field is produced .",
    "a feature of the solution is that the radial velocity , although everywhere subsonic , is rather large and non - uniform in direction .",
    "the reason for the profile of @xmath191 is that the flux is being expelled rapidly ( @xmath236 ) by turbulent diffusion . in the upper layers , where @xmath229 is small",
    ", the fluid must follow the field and therefore flows rapidly outwards . to achieve the net accretion rate imposed by the vertically integrated viscous stress , a strong inflow",
    "is then required close to the mid - plane .",
    "such a profile might even be considered advantageous for jet launching , since the outflow itself must involve a positive radial velocity .    with @xmath237 , as in this example , and assuming @xmath225 , zero flux migration is found at @xmath238 .",
    "this is now close to @xmath218 as expected from simple arguments , probably because the field - line bending occurs close to the mid - plane .    on the other hand",
    ", these considerations may be inconsistent because the example in fig .",
    "3 is magnetorotationally stable and therefore unlikely to be turbulent . of course",
    ", if there is no turbulent magnetic diffusivity , the origin of the viscosity should also be questioned .    for a range of intermediate field strengths ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "solutions are not found in which the field lines bend in the simple way seen in figs  2 and  3 .",
    "instead , branches of solutions appear in which the field lines bend several times as they pass through the disk .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "according to ogilvie ( 1998 , theorem  1 ) such a solution would be magnetorotationally unstable in ideal mhd .",
    "the multiple bending is closely related to the appearance of the ` channel solution ' which is the first stage of the magnetorotational instability for a vertical field .",
    "we conjecture that such multiple - bending solutions are also unstable when the turbulent magnetic diffusivity is taken into account ( in both the equilibrium and perturbation equations ) , although this has not been proven .",
    "if correct , this would imply that solutions of this type are physically inconsistent and ought to be disregarded , which in turn would suggest that no steady solution is possible for these intermediate field strengths .",
    "_ however , our alternative proposal , the marginal stability hypothesis , allows for a possible solution of this difficulty .",
    "_      under the marginal stability hypothesis , the strength of the turbulence ( quantified through the parameter @xmath80 ) is just sufficient to bring the equilibrium to marginal magnetorotational stability .",
    "this enables us to find single - bending solutions in a continuous range of field strengths from very small values up to the strength at which the instability is suppressed even without a turbulent diffusivity .",
    "we adopt the same parameters as in the previous section , except that @xmath80 is now to be determined as part of the solution .",
    "5 shows how the required value of @xmath80 varies with @xmath239 for solutions with vertical fields ( @xmath240 ) .",
    "this has the general form expected from the crude estimate , equation ( [ crude ] ) .",
    "however , it is somewhat worrying that values of @xmath80 in excess of unity may be required .",
    "it is often argued that @xmath80 should not exceed unity because the turbulence would then have to be supersonic , or to have a correlation length greater than the disk thickness ( e.g.  pringle 1981 ) .",
    "it is not clear whether these constraints necessarily apply to magnetorotational turbulence , which is dominated by anisotropic maxwell stresses whose correlation length in the azimuthal direction could exceed @xmath17 ( e.g.  armitage 1998 ) , but which could be limited instead by magnetic buoyancy .",
    "moreover , the effective transport coefficients may themselves be anisotropic in the presence of a strong mean field ( e.g.  matthaeus et  al .",
    "1998 ) and the magnetic prandtl number may also differ from unity . indeed , it is not certain whether the effects of the turbulence can be described adequately in terms of an effective diffusivity ; it may be that coherent magnetic structures are formed .",
    "nevertheless , the question remains as to whether the turbulence can truly reach a level sufficient to achieve marginal stability in the presence of a significant mean field .",
    "the numerical simulations by hawley et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) are in qualitative agreement with fig .  5 but suggest that , when the field strength is just below the stability boundary for a given computational domain , the channel solution may continue to grow without degenerating into turbulence .",
    "however , simulations of stratified models with fairly strong mean vertical fields do not appear to have been successful .    an example solution calculated under the marginal stability hypothesis",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "this has @xmath241 and should be contrasted with the solution in fig .  4 which has the same vertical field strength but a fixed @xmath203 .",
    "the marginally stable solution has field lines with a single bend which become straight not far below the photosphere .",
    "the pressure and temperature decline smoothly and monotonically with increasing height .",
    "the field is not significantly wound up ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "the principal aim of this paper was to determine how the mass loss rate in the outflow , @xmath243 , varies with the strength and inclination of the magnetic field . in fig .",
    "7 we show the result of this calculation under the fixed alpha hypothesis with @xmath203 and other parameters as given in section  5.3 .",
    "note that the reciprocal of @xmath244 is approximately the number of orbits in which the disk would be evaporated if not replenished by the accretion flow . in fig .",
    "8 we plot the quantity @xmath245 as a function of @xmath239 for solutions with @xmath227 .",
    "this alternative dimensionless measure of the outflow rate is the local mass loss rate per unit logarithmic interval in radius , divided by the accretion rate .",
    "the outcome is as we found in paper  i. the solutions shown are magnetorotationally stable .",
    "close to the edge of the solution manifold , the outflow is very vigorous , but if the field strength is increased by only a factor of two above the stability boundary , the outflow is suppressed by twenty orders of magnitude or so . as explained in paper  i , this happens because the disk becomes significantly sub - keplerian ( cf .",
    "3 ) and the outflow experiences a large potential barrier ( whose strength is roughly proportional to @xmath246 ) .",
    "this means that , in the absence of additional heating , external irradiation , or other driving mechanisms , outflows are suppressed from strongly magnetized disks . for a fixed field strength ,",
    "the outflow is maximized at an intermediate inclination angle of 40@xmath247 .",
    "the corresponding results for the marginal stability hypothesis are shown in figs  9 and  10 .",
    "note that this is a complementary region of parameter space corresponding to turbulent disks .",
    "the behavior of the mass loss rate is now completely different and perhaps more intuitive : it increases monotonically with increasing @xmath239 and with increasing  @xmath1 .",
    "however , the solution branch terminates before excessive mass loss rates are achieved .",
    "this suggests that a large potential barrier is not incurred for turbulent disks and that they are more promising for jet launching .",
    "the potential barrier is smaller because the magnetic field is weaker , resulting in a smaller lorentz force and a smaller deviation from keplerian rotation .",
    "these two sets of results were obtained under different physical assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , they both suggest that efficient jet - launching solutions are found in a limited range of field strengths , and in a limited range of inclination angles in excess of @xmath248 . in both cases there are difficulties in interpreting the solutions .",
    "the more strongly magnetized solutions obtained under the fixed alpha hypothesis are magnetorotationally stable , and the origin of the dissipation in the disk remains unclear .",
    "the more weakly magnetized solutions obtained under the marginal stability hypothesis typically require values of @xmath80 in excess of unity to bring the equilibrium to marginal magnetorotational stability .",
    "we have developed a model of the local vertical structure of magnetized accretion disks that launch magnetocentrifugal outflows . given certain assumptions concerning the dissipative processes ( turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity ) in the disk",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to compute the mass loss rate in the outflow as a function of the surface density and the strength and inclination of the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "the net accretion rates of mass and magnetic flux are also determined .",
    "this information is precisely complementary to that obtained from numerical simulations of the subsequent acceleration and collimation of a ` cold ' outflow ( e.g.   krasnopolsky et  al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the following result appears to be quite robust . for disks in which the mean poloidal magnetic field is sufficiently strong to stabilize the equilibrium against the magnetorotational instability",
    ", we find that the mass loss rate decreases extremely rapidly with increasing field strength , and is maximized at an inclination angle of 40@xmath247 . for turbulent disks with weaker mean fields , we find that the mass loss rate increases monotonically with increasing strength and inclination of the field , but the solution branch terminates before excessive mass loss rates are achieved .",
    "this suggests that turbulent disks with moderate mean fields are more promising for jet launching , but there may be situations in which a steady solution is impossible .    for each solution",
    "we have determined the net rate of flux migration , which depends on a competition between inward dragging by the accretion flow , and outward transport due to turbulent diffusion .",
    "the results depend on the effective magnetic prandtl number of the turbulence , which has never been measured .",
    "however , we find that inward migration is more likely to occur in the case of a weak mean field , which bends at greater heights in the disk . in this case",
    ", inward dragging may be many times more effective than estimated in previous studies ( lubow et  al .",
    "1994a ) , with the result that a net inward migration of flux may occur even when the inclination angle is sufficient for jet launching , provided that the disk is not very thin .",
    "this issue requires further analysis and a better understanding of the kinematic behavior of the magnetic field . for stronger fields ,",
    "we find fairly good agreement with previous studies , and the jet - launching configurations are much more difficult to maintain against dissipation .",
    "we speculate that this may lead naturally to a situation in which the flux is regulated to a value suitable for jet launching .",
    "however , we have not modeled the possible effect of an internal dynamo in the disk .",
    "in addition , it is quite probable that instabilities will arise when the global coupling between the outflow and the flux evolution is considered ( lubow , papaloizou , & pringle 1994b ; cao & spruit , in preparation ) .",
    "several other authors have considered the vertical structure of magnetized disks and the problem of the disk - jet connection .",
    "our formulation is distinctive in that we have shown how to calculate the mass loss rate and the accretion rates of mass and magnetic flux at any radius from a knowledge of the local surface density and the strength and inclination of the magnetic field . when coupled with a numerical simulation of the outflow beyond the sonic point",
    ", this would provide a closed evolutionary scheme for a time - dependent magnetized accretion disk with an outflow .",
    "it is crucial that we allowed the external magnetic torque on the disk to be determined by the exterior outflow solution rather than the interior solution of the vertical disk structure .",
    "there are further differences in the detail of our approach .",
    "wardle & knigl ( 1993 ) discussed many of the issues that we have addressed , but we differ from them in considering an optically thick disk with turbulent transport and energy dissipation , as opposed to an isothermal , inviscid disk with ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we are also able to calculate the net rate of flux accretion rather than specifying it as a parameter .",
    "similar comparisons may be made with the analysis of li ( 1995 ) .",
    "the model of campbell ( 1999 ) shares some features with the present paper , but his outflow solution treats the magnetic field lines as parabolae throughout the disc and the transonic region , while our solutions ( e.g.  fig .",
    "6 ) indicate that the field lines become straight in the atmosphere , provided that the plasma beta is less than unity .",
    "if @xmath249 in the atmosphere , the magnetocentrifugal mechanism does not work .",
    "interesting comparisons may be made with the steady , self - similar model of casse & ferreira ( 2000 ) . in common with those authors",
    ", we find that values of @xmath80 exceeding unity , and/or anisotropic effective turbulent diffusion coefficients , may be helpful or necessary in obtaining plausible solutions for efficient jet - launching disks .",
    "admittedly , our model has some limitations .",
    "our simple modeling of the effects of the turbulence is consistent with the very limited information available from numerical simulations , although we have not included a dynamo @xmath80-effect .",
    "we have assumed that the atmosphere is magnetically dominated so that the poloidal field lines act as rigid channels for the outflow .",
    "this constraint could be relaxed in future work at the expense of introducing considerable complications in solving for the atmospheric flow , and in matching to the exterior solution .",
    "future work should aim at obtaining a better understanding of the interaction of the mean magnetic field with the turbulence .",
    "numerical simulations might be used to measure the effective magnetic diffusivity tensor and how it depends on the strength of the field .",
    "a crucial issue is whether , when the mean field is a significant fraction of the value required for magnetorotational stability , the ` channel solution ' of the instability persists or degenerates into turbulence .",
    "ideally the whole problem that we have defined , including the correct boundary conditions , would be solved using a numerical simulation .",
    "we have included some non - local effects ( section  4.4 ) but most of the relevant terms are included in the shearing - box local accretion disk model ( e.g.  stone et  al .",
