    "the nonlinear nature of vibrational excitations in low - dimensional molecular lattices plays a key role for energy transfer as well as energy storage in both physical , chemical and biological systems .",
    "this feature was first pointed out by davydov and co - workers @xcite to explain how the energy released by the hydrolysis of atp , partially stored in the high frequency c = o vibration ( amide - i ) of a peptide group of a protein , can be transported from one end of the protein to the other .",
    "the dipole - dipole coupling between the different peptide groups leads to the delocalization of the internal vibrations and to the formation of vibrons .",
    "the interaction between the vibrons and the phonons of the protein induces a nonlinear dynamics which counterbalances the dispersion created by the dipole - dipole coupling .",
    "it yields the creation of the so called davydov s soliton which appears as the solution of the nonlinear schrodinger ( nls ) equation within the continuum approximation .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that several properties , such as the space dimension @xcite and the discreteness of the lattice @xcite , tend to destroy the integrability of the nls equation .",
    "however , a remarkable feature given by the discrete version of this equation is the occurrence of intrinsic localized modes or discrete breathers ( for a recent review , see for instance ref .",
    "contrary to solitons , intrinsic localized modes do not require integrability for their existence and stability .",
    "they are not restricted to one - dimensional lattices and it has been suggested that they should correspond to quite general and robust solutions @xcite . in molecular lattices ,",
    "discrete breathers can be induced by the intramolecular anharmonicity of the molecules .",
    "indeed , within the semi - classical approximation @xcite , the vibron dynamics is described by the discrete nls equation . as a result",
    ", the presence of an intrinsic localized mode corresponds to a local accumulation of the internal energy , which might be pinned in the lattice or may travel through it .",
    "breather excitations are thus expected to be of fundamental importance for both vibrational energy storage and transport in molecular lattices .    in spite of the great interest that breathers have attracted ,",
    "no clear evidence has yet been found for their existence in real molecular lattices .",
    "by contrast , two - vibron bound states ( tvbs ) , which can be viewed as quantum breathers , have been observed in several systems .",
    "indeed , in quantum lattices , the intramolecular anharmonicity , which is responsible for the interaction between the vibrons , favors the formation of bound states @xcite .",
    "when two vibrons are excited , a bound state corresponds to the trapping of two quanta over only a few neighboring molecules with a resulting energy which is lesser than the energy of two quanta lying far apart .",
    "the lateral interaction yields a motion of such a state from one molecule to another , thus leading to the formation of a delocalized wave packet with a well - defined momentum .",
    "as mentioned by scott@xcite , these bound states can thus be viewed as the quantum counterpart of breathers or soliton excitations . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the formation of tvbs in low - dimensional molecular lattices was observed in molecular adsorbates such as h / si(111 ) @xcite , h / c(111 ) @xcite , co / nacl(100 ) @xcite and co / ru(100 ) @xcite using optical probes .",
    "bound states in the system h / ni(111 ) were investigated using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "in addition , the powerfulness of two - vibron infrared spectroscopy in probing the structure of admonolayers has been recently demonstrated both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the stability of both classical and quantum breathers under the influence of a fluctuating thermal bath is of fundamental importance for energy storage and energy transport at finite temperature .",
    "for instance , at biological temperature , the lifetime of the davydov s soliton is still an open question .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the amide - i excitation , in vivo , corresponds to a localized state @xcite . instead of traveling in a coherent manner",
    ", it follows a stochastic , diffusional path along the lattice . in other words , the single - vibron davydov soliton does not last long enough to be useful at biological temperatures and multi - vibron solitons have been proposed as good candidates @xcite . in the same way , the influence of white noise and nonlinear damping on the stability of the breathers of the discrete nls equation has been studied @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the lifetime of the breathers increases as the nonlinearity increases and is inversely proportional to the noise variance .",
    "by contrast , for quantum lattices , it was pointed out by jakob et al .",
    "@xcite that the dephasing constant of tvbs is larger than the single - vibron dephasing constant by a factor four .",
    "this feature , which occurs when both kinds of states interact in the same way with the thermal bath , leads to a decrease of the tvbs lifetime when compared with the single - vibron lifetime .",
    "similar results were previously obtained by bogani et al .",
    "@xcite who have characterized the relaxation of bound states in the combination regions of two internal modes in a molecular crystal .",
    "the authors have shown that the lifetime of a bound state decreases as the anharmonicity increases , excepted at very low temperature .",
    "they assumed that the anharmonicity yields the occurrence of a bound state with zero linewidth and that the relaxation , mediated by the phonons of the crystal , leads to the decay of the bound state into the two - vibron continuum .    in this paper ,",
    "a theoretical study is performed to investigate the tvbs lifetime in the overtone region of a one - dimensional molecular lattice .",
    "the bound states , which are described by using a local approach , belong to a finite linewidth energy band located below the continuum of two - vibron free states .",
    "the relaxation processes are considered by introducing a coupling between the vibrons and a thermal bath formed by a set of low frequency phonons .",
    "such a coupling , which is assumed to be responsible for dephasing mechanism only , does not allow for energy relaxation .",
    "in other words , the interaction with the thermal bath does not modify the vibron number but induces transitions between the different two - vibron eigenstates .",
    "the formalism can be applied to describe different physical situations such as the dynamics of low - dimensional adsorbed nanostructures ( molecular nanowire adsorbed on stepped surfaces ) and the collective vibration of the peptide groups in a protein ( vibrons in @xmath0-helix polypeptide proteins ) . in the first situation ,",
    "the thermal bath is formed by the phonons and the librons of the adsorbed nanowire and by the phonons of the substrate @xcite . in the second situation ,",
    "it is characterized by the low frequency vibrational modes of the protein as well as by the biological surrounding .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the hamiltonian of the vibrons and of the thermal bath , as well as the coupling hamiltonian , are described . in sec .",
    "iii , we first summerize the number states method used to characterize the tvbs and the equivalence between the two - vibron dynamics and the motion of a single fictitious particle in a one - dimensional lattice is established . then , the tvbs relaxation rate due to the coupling with acoustic phonons is expressed in terms of the two - vibron green operator which is finally determined . in sec .",
    "iv , a detailed analysis of the behavior of the rate is performed depending on the values taken by the relevant parameters of the problem ( the anharmonicity , the temperature , the thermal bath dimension ) .",
    "these results are finally discussed in sec . v.",
    "let us consider a set of @xmath1 molecules periodically distributed on the sites of a one - dimensional lattice . to characterize the vibron dynamics of this molecular lattice",
    ", we assume that each molecule @xmath2 behaves as an internal high frequency oscillator described by the standard creation and annihilation vibron operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the collective dynamics of the internal vibrations is expressed as ( using the convention @xmath5 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 defines the internal vibration hamiltonian of the @xmath2th molecule and @xmath8 represents the lateral dynamical coupling between the internal coordinates at the quadratic order . to minimize the number of parameters",
    ", we consider interactions between nearest neighbor molecules and define the hopping constant @xmath9 .",
    "note that long range lateral interactions may affect the two - vibron dynamics by inducing changes in the vibron dispersion curve .",
    "however , these effects are expected to be rather weak for a one - dimensional lattice and are disregarded in the present work .",
    "the internal vibration hamiltonian @xmath7 , including the intramolecular anharmonicity of each molecule , is described according to the model of kimball et al",
    ". @xcite . in this model , the intramolecular potential",
    "is expanded up to the fourth order with respect to the internal coordinate and a unitary transformation is performed to keep the vibron - conserving terms , only .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian @xmath10 is essentially a bose version of the hubbard model with attractive interactions written as , @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for the internal frequency of the @xmath2th molecule and @xmath13 denotes the positive anharmonic parameter .",
    "these molecules interact with their surrounding which acts as a thermal bath and which is responsible for the relaxation mechanism . to mimic the influence of the surrounding of the molecules",
    ", we assume that the thermal bath is formed by a set of low frequency harmonic oscillators which the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for the boson operators of the @xmath17 th mode with frequency @xmath18 . by neglecting the population relaxation",
    ", the thermal bath leads to stochastic fluctuations of the dynamical parameters ( internal frequency , anharmonic parameter , force constant ) which characterize the vibron dynamics . in this work",
    ", we consider that the main effect of the bath is to induce a random modulation of the internal frequency of each molecule .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian between the vibrons and the thermal bath is thus written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an operator with respect to the bath variables . in a general way",
    ", it depends on the bath coordinates in a very complicated manner .",
    "however , to simplify our discussion we consider the linear approximation in which @xmath20 is expressed as @xmath21 the previous model has been extensively used to study relaxation mechanisms in condensed matter ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) and it has been shown that the effect of the thermal bath is completely determined by the coupling distribution @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 the theory presented below to calculate the tvbs relaxation rate depends on the coupling distribution and can thus be applied to different kinds of thermal baths . in the present work",
    ", we shall restrict our analysis to an interaction with a set of acoustic phonons . in that case , the coupling distribution is determined by assuming a debye model for the phonon density of states coupled with a deformation potential approximation @xcite . therefore , @xmath22 scales as @xmath24 , where @xmath0 stands for the dimension of the phonon lattices , and is defined as , @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the cutoff frequency of the phonon bath . note that , in the present paper , the bath dimension is considered as a parameter which can take the values 1 , 2 and 3 in order to represent different physical situations . for instance , for an adsorbed",
    "one - dimensional molecular lattice , the vibrons can be coupled preferentially with the phonons of the molecular lattice .",
    "the resulting bath dimension is thus equal to one . in the same way",
    ", for a molecular adsorbate decorating a surface step , the vibrons can be coupled with the step phonons which exhibit a one - dimensional nature .",
    "moreover , we can imagine other situations such as a strong coupling with either surface phonons or bulk phonons for which the bath dimension is equal to two or three , respectively .",
    "in this section , the number states method @xcite is summarized in order to characterize the two - vibron states of the molecular lattice . within this method , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath10 ( eq.([eq : hv ] ) ) are determined by taking advantage of the fact that @xmath10 commutes with the operator @xmath27 which counts the total number of vibrational quanta . as a result , the hilbert space @xmath28 of the vibrational states can be written as the tensor product @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the subspace connected to the presence of @xmath31 vibrational quanta .",

    "moreover , specific boundary conditions are introduced depending on the parity of the number @xmath1 @xcite . however , by considering the limit @xmath53 , these features will be disregarded in this work .    since the total momentum @xmath46 is a good quantum number , the hamiltonian @xmath10 appears as block diagonal in the intermediate basis @xmath50 ( eq.([eq : bloch1 ] ) ) and the schrodinger equation can be solved for each @xmath46 value . for a given @xmath46 value ,",

    "in addition , the relaxation rate for the tvbs with wave vector @xmath146 appears now greater than the relaxation rate for the tvbs with wave vector @xmath147 but , as previously , the difference is less and less important as the anharmonicity increases . as shown in fig .",
    "7b , the ratio @xmath172 decreases as the anharmonicity increases .",

    "note that , the various curves exhibit two regimes depending on the anharmonicity since the ratio rapidly decreases at low anharmonicity , i.e. @xmath183 , whereas it decreases more slowly at high anharmonicity .    the same results are shown in figs . 8a and 8b when the bath dimension is equal to @xmath168 .",
    "as in the previous case , the ratio @xmath170 is almost independent on the anharmonicity at very low temperature ( @xmath171 ) , but decreases as the anharmonicity increases when @xmath179 ( fig .",
    "for instance , when @xmath174 and @xmath146 , the tvbs relaxation rate is equal to @xmath184 time the single - vibron rate when @xmath176 whereas this ratio is equal to @xmath185 when @xmath178 .",
    "moreover , the relaxation rate for the tvbs with wave vector @xmath146 is greater than the relaxation rate for the tvbs with wave vector @xmath147 .",
    "note that , at high temperature , the rate clearly shows two distinct regimes since it exhibits a fast decrease at low anharmonicity ( @xmath186 ) whereas it decreases more slowly at high anharmonicity and becomes almost constant . as shown in fig .",
    "8b , the ratio @xmath172 behaves in a fully different way with respect to the two previous situations . at low temperature , i.e. @xmath171 , it is lesser than unity and decreases as the anharmonicity increases .",
    "when the temperature is equal to @xmath180 , it first slightly decreases at very low anharmonicity ( @xmath151 ) , then it increases with @xmath13 to reach a maximum value equal to @xmath187 at @xmath188 . finally , as increasing the anharmonicity from the previous value , the ratio decreases . at higher temperature ,",
    "i.e. @xmath189 and @xmath190 , the ratio shows a similar behavior but increases more drastically .",
    "note that it does not reach a maximum value into the anharmonicity range considered in this work .",
    "to interpret and discuss the previous numerical results , let us first focus our attention on the temperature dependence of the tvbs relaxation rate . indeed , whatever both the anharmonicity and the bath dimension , the rate exhibits a powerlaw and a linear dependence on the temperature at low and high temperature , respectively .",
    "these features are due to the fact that the relaxation involves single phonon processes in the course of which a phonon is absorbed or emitted . as a result",
    ", the rate depends linearly on the phonon bose - einstein distribution which is responsible for the observed behavior .",
    "when @xmath146 , the tvbs frequency lies at the bottom of the tvbs band .",
    "the relaxation involves phonon absorption only , and , therefore , the corresponding rate vanishes as the temperature tends to zero since the number of phonons becomes infinitesimally small .",
    "by contrast , for a finite wave vector , phonon emission can occur leading to a finite value of the rate at zero temperature .",
    "note that in our simulation we used a positive value for the lateral force constant @xmath9 . as a result , the single vibron state @xmath143 , which was considered as the reference for the calculation of the rate @xmath145 , lies at the top of the single - vibron band .",
    "therefore , @xmath145 reaches a finite value at @xmath191 since phonon emission can takes place and depends linearly on the temperature at high temperature .    the more surprising results are clearly related to the behavior of the tvbs relaxation rate with respect to the anharmonicity .",
    "indeed , whatever the value of the bath dimension , the rate is a slowly varying function of the anharmonicity at very low temperature , and the relaxation path involves the decay of the tvbs over the other tvbs , only ( see figs .",
    "7b , 8b and 9b , for @xmath171 ) .",
    "however , at sufficiently high temperature ( @xmath192 ) , the numerical results indicate that the rate exhibits two distinct regimes depending on the bath dimension . when @xmath156 , the tvbs relaxation rate increases with the anharmonicity and reaches a limiting value almost four time greater than the single - vibron rate .",
    "moreover , the main contribution of the rate involves the relaxation over the other tvbs , only . in a marked contrast , when the bath dimension is equal to 2 and 3 , the rate decreases as the anharmonic parameter @xmath13 increases .",
    "when @xmath164 , the relaxation involves the decay of the tvbs into both tvbs and tvfs , the two processes contributing in a similar way to the rate .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath168 , the decay into the tvbs becomes negligible and the main contribution of the rate involves transitions from the tvbs to the continuum of tvfs .",
    "such features originate in the convolution product between the projected dos @xmath193 and the coupling distribution @xmath22 weighted by the bose - einstein distribution . when @xmath157 , the bose - einstein distribution decreases exponentially with the phonon frequency and thus favors the exchange of very low frequency phonons .",
    "therefore , whatever the bath dimension , the tvbs can not decay into the tvfs continuum and relaxes over the other tvbs .",
    "when @xmath194 , both phonon emission and phonon absorption contribute similarly to the rate since @xmath195 .",
    "the rate reduces to the convolution between the projected dos and the distribution @xmath196 .",
    "this latter function scales as @xmath197 and is constant when @xmath198 whereas it increases with @xmath199 when both @xmath164 and @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath156 , the relaxation of the tvbs mediated by phonon exchange occurs with the same probability whatever the value of the frequency of the phonon involved in the process . as a consequence ,",
    "the behavior of the rate is governed by the strength of the coupling between the tvbs and the other two - vibron states induced by the vibron / phonon interaction . from eqs.([eq : rate4])-([eq : dos ] ) , this coupling , which is expressed as the integration of the projected dos , leads to a relaxation rate written as @xmath201 after some straightforward calculations , eq.([eq : rate1d ] ) leads to a ratio @xmath170 expressed as @xmath202 the ratio @xmath170 increases with the anharmonicity , in perfect agreement with the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "6a , and evolves from 2 when @xmath66 to 4 when a tends to infinity . in other words , for a small anharmonicity , the tvbs relaxation rate is twice the single - vibron rate which indicates that the two vibrons are almost independent , i.e. the tvbs rate appears as the sum of the rates connected to each vibron . as increasing the anharmonic parameter , the length of the bond between the two vibrons ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) ) reduces and the local nature of the vibron population increases to reach a limiting value equal to 2 . the strength of the coupling , proportional to the square of the population , leads to a factor 4 between the tvbs rate and the single - vibron rate . note that as increasing the value of the wave vector , the local nature of the tvbs increases since the length of the bond between the two vibrons decreases ( cf eq.([eq : xi ] ) ) leading to an enhancement of the relaxation rate .    in a marked contrast ,",
    "when @xmath164 and @xmath200 , the behavior of the tvbs relaxation rate results in the competition between the projected dos and the coupling distribution @xmath196 which contribute in an opposite way .",
    "indeed , the projected dos , which is maximum in the frequency range of the bound states , favors transitions from the tvbs to the other tvbs .",
    "such transitions can thus be induced by the exchange of low frequency phonons",
    ". however , the coupling distribution @xmath196 , which increases with the phonon frequency , favors transitions mediated by high frequency phonons from the tvbs to the tvfs continuum . at high temperature ,",
    "the numerical results clearly show that the decay of the tvbs into the tvfs continuum is the main contribution of the rate .",
    "this feature indicates that the influence of the phonon coupling distribution prevails .",
    "however , the contribution of the projected dos in the frequency range of the tvfs decreases drastically as the anharmonicity increases and counterbalances the growth of the phonon coupling distribution . as a result ,",
    "the rate decreases with respect to the anharmonic parameter . the effect of the phonon coupling distribution becomes stronger as the bath dimension increases .",
    "indeed , when @xmath164 , both decays into the tvbs and tvfs continuum , occur with almost the same probability .",
    "however , when @xmath168 , the latter path for the relaxation becomes strongly dominant .",
    "note that as increasing the value of the wave vector , the energy difference between the tvbs and the tvfs continuum decreases . as a result ,",
    "the frequency of the phonon exchanged during the relaxation mechanism decreases leading to a lesser value for the relaxation rate since the coupling distribution @xmath203 is reduced .    when the anharmonicity is sufficiently strong , an analytic expression of the projected dos in the frequency range of the tvbs can be determined .",
    "indeed , by performing a second order expansion of eq.([eq : tvbse ] ) with respect to @xmath204 , the frequency of the tvbs is expressed as @xmath205 .",
    "therefore , the tvbs dynamics can be compared with the dynamics of a single vibron characterized by a force constant @xmath206 .",
    "the projected dos @xmath207 is thus given by the single vibron density of states eq.([eq : g1v ] ) according to the correspondences @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "the rate @xmath210 for the decay of the tvbs into the other tvbs is thus given by eq.([eq : ratesv ] ) with the previous correspondences and by adding a factor four to account for the population effect .",
    "for instance , at high temperature , the rate for the relaxation of the tvbs with zero wave vector is written as @xmath211 where @xmath212 is defined in terms of the gamma function as @xmath213 .",
    "as shown in eq.([eq : rbb ] ) , the rate @xmath214 , which scales as @xmath215 , is constant when @xmath156 whereas it decreases when @xmath216 .",
    "although no analytical expression for the rate @xmath217 can be determined , the numerical results clearly show that this rate scales as 1/a when @xmath156 and becomes negligible compared with @xmath210 .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath164 and @xmath200 , the rate @xmath217 decreases with @xmath13 according to a law decaying more slowly than @xmath215 , and is the dominant contribution of the rate .    at this step , let us mention that the numerical results presented in the previous section were obtained by considering integer values for the bath dimension .",
    "however , the formalism can be applied to real values of the bath dimension .",
    "in particular , at high temperature and strong anharmonicity , our calculations predict that the tvbs relaxation rate decreases with the anharmonicity when @xmath216 .",
    "in addition , the dominant relaxation pathway corresponds to the decay of the tvbs into the other tvbs over a large @xmath0 range , i.e. @xmath218 where @xmath219 . in that case , the total relaxation rate is thus approximately given by eq.([eq : rbb ] ) .",
    "for instance , when @xmath220 and @xmath178 , the ratio @xmath221 is equal to unity for a bath dimension @xmath222 .",
    "to illustrate the previous theoretical calculations , let us compare our results with experimental data .",
    "the system co / nacl(100 ) was previously studied using molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the co monolayer has a @xmath99 structure with a rectangular unit cell containing two molecules mutually perpendicular .",
    "since the lateral interaction was shown to be strongly anisotropic , the vibron dynamics of the monolayer exhibits a one - dimensional character .",
    "for instance , along the longer size of the unit cell , the lateral force constant between nearest neighbor molecules is positive and equal to @xmath223 @xmath98 .",
    "assuming an anharmonic parameter equal to the gas phase value , i.e. @xmath224 @xmath98 , the reduced anharmonicity is @xmath225 . at @xmath226 k and for a bath dimension @xmath156 , the theoretical ratio @xmath158 is equal to 1.3 .",
    "note that for a bath dimension equal to 2 or 3 , the ratio is drastically reduced by a factor of about 10 .",
    "this result is in a perfect agreement with the experimental ratio , equal to 1.55 , obtained by dai and ewing @xcite .",
    "a genuine one - dimensional lattice was obtained by jakob @xcite by carefully controlling the adsorption of co on a pt(111 ) surface exhibiting steps . as measured by the author ,",
    "the dynamical coupling between the molecules is responsible for a blueshift @xmath227 @xmath98 . by assuming nearest neighbor interactions",
    ", this coupling leads to a positive lateral force constant @xmath228 @xmath98 .",
    "in addition , the anharmonicity of the system , measured by jakob , yields a reduced parameter @xmath229 . by following the experiment performed by the author",
    ", we thus obtain a ratio @xmath230 at @xmath231 k , which is in good agreement with the experimental ratio equal to 1.5 .    to conclude ,",
    "let us discuss the main implications of the previous results on the energy transport mediated by tvbs . indeed , from a quantum kinetic point of view , the vibron / phonon interaction is responsible for the breaking of the coherence and favors a diffusional motion of the vibrons after a time scale of about the dephasing time @xcite .",
    "the previous results clearly show that such a diffusional motion , for tvbs , drastically depends on the bath dimension . when @xmath156 , the coupling with the phonons is not strong enough to break the bond between the two vibrons which can not decay into the continuum of tvfs .",
    "therefore , the thermal bath keeps the internal coherence between the two vibrons but induces momentum scattering which is responsible for transitions from a tvbs to another tvbs .",
    "such a scattering in momentum space corresponds to incoherent hops in real space in the course of which the center of mass of the two vibrons has a diffusional motion .",
    "therefore , although the energy is transported in an incoherent way , it diffuses by packets along the lattice .",
    "note that since the tvbs relaxation rate is almost four time greater than the corresponding single - vibron rate , a similar ratio is expected for the diffusion coefficients . by contrast ,",
    "when @xmath164 or @xmath200 , the phonon bath favors the breaking of the bond between the two vibrons over a large anharmonicity range . as a result , the decay of the tvbs into the continuum of tvfs takes place and the two particles will tend to diffuse independently leading to the uniformization of the energy along the lattice .    finally , let us mention some remarks on forthcoming work .",
    "first , the present results were obtained by considering the coupling between the vibrons and acoustic phonons . however , as discussed in sec .",
    "ii , the formalism can be applied to different kinds of thermal bath . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate the effect of optical phonons which can be responsible for the occurrence of resonances between the tvbs band and the tvfs continuum .",
    "these features were pointed out experimentally by jakob et al .",
    "@xcite when studying the linewidth of the overtone of the system co / ru and attributed to the coupling with the frustrated translation mode of the monolayer .",
    "second , we have restricted our analysis to processes involving a single phonon , only . however , two - phonon processes can contribute significantly to the relaxation rate , depending on the bath dimension .",
    "for instance , two - phonon processes may enhance the spectral distribution of the vibron / phonon coupling at low frequency favoring the decay of tvbs into the tvbs band .",

    "<S> the lifetime of two - vibron bound states in the overtone region of a one - dimensional anharmonic molecular lattice is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the anharmonicity , introduced within an attractive hubbard hamiltonian for bosons , is responsible for the formation of bound states which belong to a finite linewidth band located below the continuum of two - vibron free states . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of these bound states into either bound or free states , is described by considering the coupling between the vibrons and a thermal bath formed by a set of low frequency acoustic phonons . the relaxation rate is expressed in terms of the spectral distribution of the vibron / phonon coupling and of the two - vibron green operator which is calculated exactly by using the number states method . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the two - vibron bound states relaxation rate is analyzed with a special emphasis on the influence of the anharmonicity . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the rate exhibits two distinct regimes depending on the thermal bath dimension . </S>",
    "<S> when the bath dimension is equal to unity , the rate increases with the anharmonicity and the decay of the two - vibron bound states into the other bound states appears as the main contribution of the rate . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , when the bath dimension is equal to 2 and 3 , the rate decreases as the anharmonicity increases indicating that the two - vibron bound states decay into the two - vibron free states continuum . </S>"
