    "investigations of current fluctuations in mesoscopic conductors enable one to extract important information about their microscopic properties , such as , e.g. , transmissions @xmath1 of their conducting channels .",
    "a great deal of information is provided by the analysis of shot noise @xcite .",
    "for instance , experimental confirmation of shot noise suppression in diffusive conductors ( as compared to its poisson value ) by the fano factor @xmath2 served as a strong argument supporting the validity of the universal transmission distribution @xmath3 in such conductors , see refs . for more details on this subject .",
    "it was also realized , that transmission distributions in composite conductors , such as , e.g. , a tunnel junction attached to a diffusive wire can behave in a rather non - trivial way .",
    "for instance , it was observed experimentally that the low energy andreev conductance of hybrid normal - superconducting structures may coincide with its conductance in the normal state .",
    "this zero - bias anomaly phenomenon @xcite was explained @xcite by finding out that the transparency distribution for a composite system reduces to that of a diffusive conductor provided the resistance of the latter exceeds that of the tunnel barrier .",
    "this phenomenon can be interpreted as disorder - induced opening of tunneling channels .",
    "yet another non - trivial property of composite conductors involving many coherent scatterers is that shot noise in such systems turns out to be identical to that in a diffusive element even if none of these scatterers is diffusive .",
    "these property was initially established for chains of tunnel barriers @xcite and later demonstrated also for other situations @xcite .",
    "most generally , one can consider a chain of @xmath4 different coherent conductors with arbitrary transmission distributions @xmath5 of their conducting channels and define their resistances @xmath6 and fano factors @xmath7 as @xmath8 with @xmath9 standing for the charge of the electron .",
    "as usually , shot noise in such composite conductor with resistance @xmath10 can be described by the correlation function @xmath11 where @xmath12 accounts for current fluctuations around its average value @xmath13 and @xmath14 is externally applied voltage bias . here and below averaging @xmath15 should in generally be understood as the expectation value for the corresponding current operators . for the symmetric version of the correlator ( [ shot ] ) in the zero frequency limit and at zero temperature one has @xmath16 , where the fano factor @xmath17 of this general composite conductor reads @xcite @xmath18 this formula clearly demonstrates that in the limit of sufficiently large @xmath4 one has @xmath19 , i.e. a long chain of arbitrary  not necessarily diffusive  conductors universally behaves as a diffusive conductor .    along with shot noise",
    "one can also investigate higher current cumulants . according to full counting statistics ( fcs ) theory @xcite these cumulants are in general expressed not only in terms of the fano factor @xmath17 but also contain other combinations of channel transmissions .",
    "for instance , the third current cumulant @xmath20 after its proper symmetrization @xcite can be cast to the form @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the function of bias voltage @xmath14 , temperature @xmath24 and frequencies @xmath25 to be defined below .",
    "thus , by studying the cumulant ( [ third ] ) one can recover not only the fano factor @xmath17 but also the combination ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "experimental investigations of the third current cumulant have already started @xcite , thereby making @xmath26 ( along with @xmath17 ) a directly measurable quantity .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of electron - electron interactions the combination ( [ gamma ] ) also affects the second current cumulant @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath26 can in principle be extracted from the noise measurements as well .    in the light of all these developments",
    "it would be useful to formulate a general approach enabling one to recover the parameter @xmath26 ( [ gamma ] ) for composite conductors . in the present paper",
    "we will address a specific situation that is frequently encountered in modern experiments embracing a variety of meso- and nanostructures : an arbitrary coherent diffusive conductor is connected to an external measuring scheme ( leads ) via tunneling interfaces .",
    "in other words , we will consider a composite conductor consisting of two tunnel barriers connected by a diffusive element .",
    "employing the non - linear @xmath0-model technique we will develop a method enabling one to evaluate the fcs generating function for this system .",
    "we will then derive the parameter @xmath26 in terms of both tunneling and diffusive resistances involved in our problem .",
    "the corresponding expression can be directly used in future experiments investigating current fluctuations in such composite conductors .",
    "conversely , information about three first current cumulants allows to fully determine the resistances of the three elements of the system under consideration .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we work out a non - linear @xmath0-model approach and establish general expressions for the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath26 of our composite conductor . our results and their possible extensions",
    "are then discussed in sec .",
    "some technical details of our calculation are relegated to appendix .",
    "we will consider a system which consists of a normal diffusive conductor with resistance @xmath27 and length @xmath28 attached to two big normal reservoirs via tunnel barriers ( located at @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) with resistances @xmath31 and @xmath32 and cross - sections @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this system is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "we will assume that the whole system remains coherent , i.e. @xmath28 is shorter than both phase and energy relaxation lengths .",
    "we will also assume that the thouless energy ( inverse dwell time ) of a composite conductor in - between two reservoirs is larger than any other energy scale in our problem .     between two normal reservoirs attached via tunnel barriers with resistances",

    "the @xmath50 matrix @xmath51 term depends on the hubbard - stratonovich fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 defined respectively on the forward and backward branches of the keldysh contour . as usually , these fluctuating fields emerge after the standard decoupling procedure in the coulomb term in the hamiltonian . here",

    "now let us employ the above non - linear @xmath0-model formalism in order to construct the fcs generating function .",
    "in what follows we will assume that an external dc voltage @xmath14 is applied to the system .",
    "this voltage is accounted for by a simple shift of the classical component @xmath61 . at this stage",
    "we also neglect the effect of electron - electron interactions by setting the quantum component of the scalar potential equal to zero @xmath62 . at the same time we will still keep the quantum component of the vector potential @xmath63 which is needed for further evaluation of the current cumulants .",
    "note that the frequency dependence of the third current cumulant in eq .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) is fully accounted for by the function @xmath23 evaluated in @xcite , while the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath26 are frequency - independent .",
    "hence , in order to determine these parameters it suffices to perform our calculation in the zero frequency limit . in this case , similarly to ref .",
    "it is convenient to employ the pure gauge @xmath64 we will see that @xmath65 is going to play the role of the counting field in the fcs generating function for our problem .",

    ", the scalar potential of the right reservoir equals to zero .",
    "the counting field @xmath65 can be gauged away from the action ( [ saq2 ] ) at the expense of the following transformation of the green - keldysh matrix of the right reservoir : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the pauli matrix .",

    "making use of the correspondence @xmath89 this result allows to recover the first three current cumulants for our composite conductor .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the expressions for these cumulants  including the third one @xcite  can be fully described not only in the zero frequency limit , but also at finite frequencies .",
    "this and some other applications of the above results will be briefly discussed in the next section .",
    "it is satisfactory to observe that our result for @xmath17 ( [ bg ] ) is fully consistent with the general formula ( [ farb ] ) derived within a totally different framework .",
    "we also observe that , as compared to @xmath17 , the expression for @xmath26 ( [ ga ] ) is determined by a substantially more complicated combination of resistances @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath27 . even more complicated expression for @xmath26 can be expected in a general case of @xmath4 arbitrary conductors .",

    "( [ bg ] ) and ( [ ga ] ) we obtain @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "( [ s3 ] ) , ( [ bg ] ) and ( [ ga ] ) fully describe the third current cumulant in our composite conductor provided its size is restricted in such a way that its thouless energy ( inverse dwell time ) remains the highest energy parameter in the problem .",
    "note that the opposite physical limit of very long dwell times was studied for a chaotic cavity in ref . .",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath108 established in that limit @xcite differs from ours , however in the limit of zero frequencies the results @xcite are consistent with ours ( taken at @xmath109 ) provided we set @xmath110 in eqs .",
    "( [ bg ] ) and ( [ ga ] ) .",
    "we also note that non - symmetric third cumulants of the current can also be analyzed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding results for @xmath108 being in general different from eq .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) also contain the parameter @xmath26 ( [ gamma ] ) evaluated here .",
    "let us now take into account electron - electron interactions .",
    "it was argued @xcite that such interactions may affect shot noise .",
    "in particular , for @xmath111 and @xmath112 we obtain @xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are respectively the quantum resistance unit and the effective sample capacitance .",
    "this result also follows directly from the renormalization group analysis @xcite stating that electron - electron interactions effectively yield energy dependent renormalization of channel transmissions .",
    "( [ intc ] ) demonstrates that the magnitude of the leading interaction correction to the second current cumulant @xmath116 is governed by the combination @xmath117 . this combination  depending on the system",
    " can take either positive or negative values .",
    "accordingly , electron - electron interactions can either suppress or enhance shot noise .",
    "in the situation considered here the parameter @xmath117 is always positive ranging from 1/15 to 1 depending on the resistance values .",
    "hence , in our case coulomb interaction always tends to suppress shot noise .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that our results ( [ bg ] ) and ( [ ga ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the following equations @xmath118 two real solutions of these equations ( corresponding to @xmath119 ) can be easily found numerically .",
    "thus , information about the first three current cumulants is sufficient to determine all three resistances @xmath31 , @xmath27 and @xmath32 in the system under consideration .",
    "finally , we would like to note that our analysis also allows to derive the fourth and even higher current cumulants for our composite conductor .",
    "for this purpose it is necessary to establish higher order in @xmath65 terms in the expression for the generating function @xmath120 .",
    "this calculation , although quite tedious , can be performed in a straightforward manner along the same lines as it was demonstrated here .",
    "yet another promising extension of our formalism could be to apply it to hybrid normal - superconducting structures . in this case",
    "modifications simply amount to including superconductivity into the usadel equations in the standard manner . the corresponding analysis",
    ", however , is beyond the frames of the present paper .",
    "let us present some details of our calculation .",
