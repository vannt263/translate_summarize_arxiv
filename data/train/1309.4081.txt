    "nitride - based quantum dots ( qds ) are one of the most promising candidates for achieving on - chip electrically - driven single - photon sources at room temperature @xcite . the optical performance of these devices , such as their quantum efficiency ( qe ) , operation speed and single - photon purity , critically depends on the carrier dynamics , such as the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the carries .",
    "the carrier dynamics , in turn , is determined by nano - scale structural parameters , such as the diameter , thickness , material compositions and surface properties .",
    "therefore , the key to improve the performance is to know what the structural parameters are and how they impact the performance . however , it is nearly impossible to directly measure all the relevant structural parameters of every single qd non - destructively with sufficient accuracy using current technologies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between the optical properties and the structural parameters was obscure in previous studies in which the qds were typically formed at random positions with large structural inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we have recently demonstrated high - quality site - controlled ingan qds whose structural parameters were controlled to the limit of the state - of - the - art growth and nano - fabrication technologies @xcite . using these qds , we are able to systematically study the optical properties of qds with diameters ranging from 19  nm to 33  nm , using time - integrated and time - resolved photoluminescence ( pl ) spectroscopy as well as second - order correlation ( @xmath0 ) measurements at temperatures from 10  k to 120  k. such a study allows us to observe strong correlations between the structural parameters and optical properties and , based on which , extract the underlying carrier dynamics in these nitride - based qds .",
    "in addition , we show that opposed to the common practice assuming 100% quantum efficiency at low - temperatures , quantum - tunnelling leads to significant surface recombination in some qds even at temperatures down to 10  k. furthermore , contradictory to conventional expectations , we show that for our qds the best photon - antibunching does not always occur in the brightest qds or at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the above observations are intuitively explained by our carrier dynamics model , providing guidance for future improvement of single - photon sources based on iii - nitride qds .",

    "the nonradiative decay is determined by two competing processes : on one hand , the strain - relaxation at the sidewall forms a confinement potential protecting excitons from recombining with the nonradiative surface states ; on the other hand , excitons can overcome the potential barrier through tunnelling and thermal activation .    in an etched ingan / gan nanodisk ,",
    "the lateral confinement potential for the exciton is formed due to strain - relaxation at the sidewall , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) .",
    "this is manifested as a continuous blueshift of qd pl energy with the reduction of the diameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] ) , which shows the piezoelectric field is the determining factor of the potential profile , as explained in @xcite . the larger strain - relaxation at the sidewall compared to the center of the nanodisk leads to a weaker piezoelectric field and , thus , higher exciton energy .",

    "we will examine them in sec .",
    "[ sec : decay_rates ] by the diameter and temperature dependence of the pl intensity and decay time of qd ensembles .",
    "here we present main principles of radiative and nonradiative decay below :    the radiative decay rate @xmath16 of an exciton in an ingan / gan nanodisk is determined by its oscillator strength , the local density of photon states ( ldps ) and the temperature .",
    "the oscillator strength increases due to strain relaxation , whereas the ldps decreases as the nanodisk diameter is reduced @xcite . meanwhile , since an exciton can be thermally scattered out of the radiation zone in the momentum space , the averaged @xmath16 is expected to decrease as temperature increases @xcite .",
    "the relative @xmath16 is reflected by the ratio of the pl intensity and the decay time , as will be explained in sec .",
    "[ ssec : gamma_r ] .",
    "the nonradiative decay of an exciton can occur at the surface and in the volume of a qd .",
    "the volume recombination includes the shockley - read - hall @xcite and auger @xcite processes . in our qds ,",
    "the volume recombination was negligible , because at any given temperature the planar qw on the same sample had a measured total decay time over ten times longer than that observed from the qds investigated in this work .",
    "the surface nonradiative recombination is of major concern for nanosturctures with large surface - to - volume ratios .",
    "there are two types of surface nonradiative decay processes based on the way excitons overcome the potential barrier and reach the sidewall surface : the tunneling decay and thermal decay , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , which is analogous to the field emission and thermionic emission in the standard schottky barrier theory @xcite .",
    "the tunnelling decay is the dominant nonradiative decay mechanism at low temperatures in our qds .",
    "it is due to the tunnelling of the exciton through the potential barrier to the surface , and is determined by the wavefunction overlap of the exciton and surface states .",
    "hence , the tunnelling decay rate @xmath14 is finite even at zero temperature as shown in sec .",
    "[ ssec : gamma_tnl ] .",
    "it strongly depends on the potential barrier profile and only has a weak temperature dependence , similar to the thermionic - field - emission component in the schottky barrier theory @xcite .",
    "the thermal decay becomes the dominant nonradiative decay mechanism as the temperature increases .",
    "it is due to the thermal activation of the exciton over the potential barrier to the surface .",
    "therefore , the thermal decay rate @xmath15 depends strongly on the temperature as well as the potential barrier profile as shown in sec .",
    "[ ssec : gamma_thm ] .    experimentally characterizing the radiative , tunnelling and thermal decay independently is , however , far from straightforward , since only the total decay rate and pl intensity can be directly measured .",
    "each of these decay rates varies differently with the potential profile , while the potential profile is determined by multiple structural parameters of the qd , such as the diameter , thickness and indium mole fraction .",
    "therefore , to obtain the dependence of each decay mechanism on each structural parameter , one would have to measure the change of the optical properties while varying each structural parameter separately .",
    "this can not be done with qds self - assembled at random sites , whose structural parameters are often correlated with each other and suffer from large inhomogeneity . on the other hand , using the site- and structure - controlled qds described in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , we can measure the dependence of the optical properties on one of the structure parameters while keeping the fluctuations in others minimal .",
    "this enables us to extract the decay rates and their dependence on various structural parameters , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : decay_rates ] . despite the control of structural parameters , small fluctuations in these parameters",
    "are inevitable .",
    "this leads to inhomogeneities in the optical properties of qds with the same nominal structural parameters , as shown in sec .",
    "[ ssec : inhomogeneity ] .",
    "however , with the tight control of the structural parameters , it turns out that the inhomogeneities in all measured optical properties are strongly correlated with each other , as shown in sec .",
    "[ ssec : correlation ] . as a result",
    ", variations in different optical properties can all be modeled by the variation of one parameter , which is identified as the sidewall potential barrier height .",
    "the above carrier dynamics model describes well the intensity and decay time of the qd emission , which is dominated by the single - exciton emission at the low excitation intensities used in this work . however , to describe the photon - antibunching property , which is determined by both the exciton and biexciton dynamics @xcite , biexciton dynamics needs to be included .",
    "the biexciton emission is different from exciton emission by its binding energy , which is typically negative in ingan qds due to the repulsive exciton - exciton coulomb interaction between the two excitons @xcite .",
    "this effectively leads to a lowering of the potential barrier for a biexciton by its binding energy , which can be extracted from the overall spectral linewidth , as explained in sec .",
    "[ ssec : bxx ] .",
    "this allows us to explain the peculiar correlation between the photon - antibunching and other pl properties in sec .",

    "[ ssec : g2_vs_t ] .",
    "as explained in the preceding section , the carrier dynamics in an ingan / gan nanodisk strongly depends on the exciton potential profile in the nanodisk .",
    "therefore , the first step towards modeling the carrier dynamics is to identify the sources of the potential profile .",
    "there are several mechanisms that could lead to an exciton potential profile in the ingan / gan nanodisk : the non - uniform distributions of the deformation potential as well as the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations due to the uneven strain distribution from the center to the sidewall of the nanodisk @xcite .",
    "note that we do not consider the contribution of the surface fermi - level pinning @xcite , because it bends the conduction and valance bands in the same way and , hence , has negligible effects on the exciton potential profile .    to identify the source of the exciton potential profile",
    "we follow the same procedure as in @xcite .",
    "we measure the pl energy of nine dense arrays of qd - nanodisks with diameters varying from 19  nm to 33  nm as well as a qw - nanodisk with 5  @xmath5 m diameter on the same sample at a temperature of 10  k. we use a very low excitation intensity @xmath17 to avoid significant screening of the electric field . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential](a ) , the pl energy blueshifts as the diameter of the qd reduces from 5  @xmath5 m to 19  nm , consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the large amount of blueshift ( @xmath18  mev ) from qw to qd shows that the piezoelectric polarization gives the dominant contribution to the exciton potential profile in our qds @xcite .",
    "the piezoelectric polarization lowers the bandgap due to the quantum - confined stark effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , reducing the diameter decreases the overall strain and piezoelectric polarization , leading to an increase in the bandgap and , correspondingly , the exciton energy .",
    "in contrast , the deformation potential increases the bandgap @xcite and would lead to a redshift of the pl energy with decreasing the nanodisk diameter .",

    "[ fig : g2_vs_t_fitting](b ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : g2_vs_t_fitting](b ) it is evident that the improvement of the @xmath145 as temperature increases is due to the faster dropping of @xmath230 compared to @xmath231 , i.e. the biexciton s thermal decay rate increases faster than the exciton s .",
    "this is ultimately because , in the same qd , the biexciton has a lower potential barrier than the exciton as a result of the repulsive exciton - exciton coulomb interaction .",

    "the inset in ( a ) is an extension of the theoretical @xmath217 curve to 300  k.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    however , @xmath145 does not always decrease with temperature .",
    "instead , there is an optimal temperature , at which @xmath145 reaches its minimal . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : g2_vs_t_fitting](a ) , the increase of @xmath145 as @xmath49 increases above 80  k is because the thermal decay of both exciton and biexciton dominate the total decay and increase exponentially with temperature .",
    "this quickly lowers both @xmath183 and @xmath180 and raises @xmath145 , similar to what happened in the region i of fig .",
    "[ fig : qd_correlation_g2 ] . the optimal temperature increases with @xmath61 ,",
    "since greater @xmath61 means higher qes for both exciton and biexciton , as well as larger difference between them .",
    "this anomalous temperature dependence of @xmath145 suggests that one way to improve the operating temperature of these qds is to increase the @xmath61 value by , for instance , having higher indium composition or thicker ingan layer .",
    "we studied the carrier dynamics of site- and structure - controlled nanodisk - in - a - wire ingan / gan qds .",
    "the minimized inhomogeneities in all key structural parameters  the qd diameter , thickness and indium composition  allowed a systematical mapping between optical properties and structural parameters .",
    "our results revealed that the sidewalls in these etched qds played a vital role in enhancing the radiative decay rate and enabling good antibunching , while it also ultimately limited the qe .",
    "the strain relaxation at the sidewall led to greatly enhanced radiative decay rates in qds compared to qws @xcite .",
    "more importantly , it created potential barriers , which are different for excitons and biexcitons and preferentially protected excitons from surface recombination , leading to low @xmath145 values .",
    "this suggests that by engineering the potential barrier height , such as by varying the indium composition or nanodisk thickness , one could achieve purer single - photon emission and at higher temperatures with qds fabricated by our method .",
    "however , the qe was ultimately limited by the surface recombination at the sidewall , even at very low temperatures , due to tunneling of the carriers to the sidewall .",
    "such surface dynamics has often been overlooked in dot - in - a - nanowire based optical devices , especially in low - temperature measurements .    furthermore , the statistical correlations between various optical properties of numerous single qds with markedly similar diameters enabled us to understand the impacts of structural parameters on the optical properties . together with the study on qd ensembles , we established a quantitative relation between the optical properties and the structural parameters .",
    "and we showed that variations in optical properties of qds of the same diameter could be modeled by the variation of only one phenomenological parameter , the exciton potential barrier height .",
    "these findings may be applicable to a wide range of strained iii - n nanostructures with large surface - to - volume ratios , such as nanowires , nanospheres , and nanopillars .",
    "hence the carrier dynamics we analyzed and quantitatively modeled in this work may have broad impacts on improving the performance of iii - n based photonic devices .",
