    "intensive studies on galaxy properties , such as star formation rates and morphology , have significantly improved our understanding of galaxies in the universe .",
    "it is , however , still unclear how galaxies evolve over the hubble time .",
    "this is due to the complex nature of galaxy properties ; galaxy properties depend not only on time , but also on environment and mass ( luminosity ) .",
    "these three axes are related to one another and they characterize galaxy evolution . despite the obvious importance , however , galaxy properties along these three axes have not been viewed simultaneously and systematically , due to the limited previous data sets none of which can cover all of these three axes .",
    "based on the wide - field subaru data and the large sdss data , we present in this paper a comprehensive study of star formation activity of galaxies along the three axes .",
    "it is now well known that galaxy properties depend on environment in which galaxies reside .",
    "this environmental dependence of galaxy properties was first quantitatively studied by @xcite , who showed the morphology - density relation based on 55 nearby clusters .",
    "there is a clear trend that early - type galaxies are preferentially located in high density regions , while late - type galaxies tend to be located in lower density regions .",
    "following this work , intensive studies on environmental dependence of galaxy properties have been carried out , and strengthened or extended the dressler s result ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy properties are also known to depend on mass ( luminosity ) of galaxies .",
    "recently conducted large surveys , such as 2df @xcite and sdss @xcite , revealed that galaxy properties show strong bimodality in their distribution @xcite .",
    "that is , there are two distinct populations : red early - type galaxies and blue late - type galaxies .",
    "this bimodality is found to be a strong function of mass of galaxies in the sense that massive galaxies tend to be red early - type galaxies , while less massive galaxies tend to be blue late - type galaxies @xcite    galaxies evolve with time , of course , as a natural consequence of stellar evolution .",
    "it is now 20 years since @xcite presented their startling result that the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters increases with look - back time or redshift .",
    "this b  o effect seems to be confirmed by later studies ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "this effect suggests that star formation activities in cluster galaxies change with time , in the sense that the fraction of star forming galaxies decreases with time .",
    "these three axes , that is , environment , mass , and time , must be closely related to one another .",
    "for example , the morphology - density relation is found to evolve ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that environmental dependence of star formation activity and morphology of galaxies change as a function of galaxy luminosity ( mass ) . to untie this complexity , we base our analyses on panoramic imaging data of two high redshift clusters , cl0015.9 + 16 at @xmath2 and rxj0152.713 at @xmath1 , and the sdss data . the former data are obtained as part of our on - going subaru distant cluster project called pisces .",
    "our data span wide ranges in environment , time , and stellar mass , and give us an unique opportunity to investigate star formation activity along all the three axes simultaneously for the first time .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : data ] , we briefly review our project pisces and our data .",
    "also we describe the data of the local universe that we use . then we move on to the procedure we adopt to eliminate foreground and background contamination in  [ sec : field_sub ] . before presenting main results ,",
    "we summarize various photometric and environmental quantities used in this paper in  [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "we examine environmental dependence of galaxy star formation in  [ sec : colour - density ] . based on results obtained in  [ sec : colour - density ] , we re - define environments in  [ sec : env_def ] .",
    "colour - magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions in various environments are shown in  [ sec : colour - magnitude ] and [ sec : luminosity_function ] , respectively . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the implications of our results on the formation and evolution of galaxies . finally , a summary is given in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "most of the important conclusions in this paper are drawn from the results presented in  5.1 ,  7 , and  9 .",
    "readers interested only in our primary conclusions can go to these sections directly after brief reading of  2 - 4 .    throughout this paper , we assume a flat universe of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we use the ab magnitude system for observed quantities and the vega - referred system for rest - frame ones .",
    "we use the following abbreviation : cmd for colour - magnitude diagram , cmr for colour - magnitude relation , and lf for luminosity function .",
    "we are conducting a systematic study of cluster evolution based on panoramic multi - band imaging with suprime - cam and optical multi - slit spectroscopy with focas on subaru . in this section",
    ", we briefly review the project _ panoramic imaging and spectroscopy of cluster evolution with subaru _ ( pisces ) .",
    "the reader should refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "the primary aims of this project are two - fold : ( 1 ) to map out large scale structures around distant clusters to trace the cluster assembly history and ( 2 ) to look into galaxy properties in detail as a function of environment along the structures in order to directly identify the environmental effects acting on galaxies during their assembly to higher density regions .",
    "the unique feature of this project is its wide - field coverage by taking advantage of the suprime - cam @xcite , which provides a @xmath6 field of view .",
    "therefore , the pisces will provide an opportunity to link an evolutionary path between galaxies in the local universe and high redshift counterparts over a wide range in environment .",
    "also , the depth of pisces , reaching down to @xmath7 at @xmath8 with an 8-m telescope , will shed light on the nature of faint galaxies at high redshifts , which probably show quite different properties compared with massive galaxies , as seen in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as part of this on - going project , we observed cl0015.9 + 1609 and rxj0152.7 - 1357 in september 2003 .",
    "the cluster cl0015.9 + 1609 ( cl0016 for short ) is one of the most extensively studied galaxy clusters , and it has been observed in various wavelength ranges : x - ray ( e.g. , @xcite ) , uv @xcite , optical ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and submm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested the existence of a large - scale structure around the cluster based on the photographic photometry , and later , the cluster was found to have companion clusters @xcite . a clear cmr is seen @xcite , and the cluster is known to have a very low blue fraction @xcite .",
    "the cluster rxj0152.71357 ( rxj0153 for short ) is one of the most x - ray luminous distant ( @xmath9 ) clusters known .",
    "the cluster was discovered independently in the _ rosat deep cluster survey _",
    "( rdcs ; @xcite ) and in the _ wide angle rosat pointed survey _ ( warps ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "later , it was also detected in the _ serendipitous high - redshift archival rosat cluster _",
    "( sharc ) survey @xcite .",
    "since these discoveries , the cluster has been the subject of _ bepposax , chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , spectroscopic follow - up @xcite , near - ir imaging @xcite , and the weak lensing analysis @xcite have also been performed .",
    "all these studies show that rxj0153 is indeed a very massive cluster at @xmath1 : the bolometric x - ray luminosity of @xmath10 , and the total dynamical mass of @xmath11 .",
    "based on the acs weak lensing analysis , @xcite suggested that the previous cluster mass estimates may be an over - estimation .",
    "below , we briefly summarize our observation of these two clusters .",
    "details of the observation and data reduction are described in @xcite .",
    "the observing conditions were excellent during the nights with a typical seeing size of @xmath12 .",
    "cl0016 was observed in @xmath13 and rxj0153 in @xmath14 .",
    "exposure times and limiting magnitudes are shown in table [ tab : obs_summary ] .",
    "object detection is performed using _ sextractor _",
    "( v.2.3.2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "objects in cl0016 are @xmath15-band selected and those in rxj0153 are @xmath16-band selected .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath15-band for cl0016 and the @xmath16-band for rxj0153 correspond to almost the same rest - frame wavelength range , and therefore we have little difference in selection effects between the two clusters .",
    "we use mag_auto for total magnitudes and @xmath17 diameter aperture magnitudes for colours .",
    "magnitude zero - points determined by the photometric standard stars taken during the same observing run are found to be offset ( @xmath18 mag . ) with respect to stellar seds of @xcite .",
    "we shift the zero - points so as to match with gunn & stryker stars .",
    "star - galaxy separation is performed on the basis of fwhm vs. total magnitude diagrams .    in what follows ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath19 galaxies in cl0016 and @xmath20 galaxies in rxj0153 .",
    "these magnitude cuts ensure that we are not affected by incompleteness effects .    .",
    "a list of exposure times and limiting magnitudes ( ab system ) .",
    "limiting magnitudes are shown as a @xmath21 limit measured in a @xmath17 aperture . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.7    0.7    0.7",
    "galaxies in clusters are known to show a tight cmr ( e.g. , @xcite ) . this relation is observed up to @xmath22 and even beyond @xcite . in this section",
    ", we aim to investigate the cmds with particular attention to the group and field environments , which have not been intensively studied yet especially at high redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : cm_rest ] shows the rest - frame cmds .",
    "we estimate the slope and scatter of the cmrs based on an iterative @xmath23-clipping least squares fit and the results are shown in figures [ fig : cm_scatter ] and [ fig : cm_slope ] .",
    "note that the cmr slopes are measured from galaxies brighter than @xmath24 which show tight relationship , while the scatter around the cmr is measured for galaxies down to our magnitude limits .",
    "errors are estimated from the bootstrap resampling of the input catalogs , and the statistical field subtraction is performed in each run . since our photometric redshift cuts have some ranges ( @xmath25 ) , a projection effect is a concern which may apparently enhance the intrinsic colour scatter .",
    "however , the colour difference in passively evolving galaxies within these redshift ranges are only 0.05 magnitude at most for both cl0016 and rxj0153 @xcite , therefore this effect is small compared to the amount of scatter we discuss here ( @xmath260.1 mag . ) .",
    "we see five very interesting trends in these figures .",
    "firstly , we find probable onset of the build - up of the cmr in field regions . in the field environment in rxj0153 at @xmath1",
    ", we can not identify any clear cmr , although a clump of bright red galaxies can be seen .",
    "in fact , the scatter around the cmr is very large ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_scatter ] ) , being consistent with no cmr .",
    "interestingly , however , a clear relation is seen in the same environment in cl0016 at @xmath2 and also in sdss at @xmath27 particularly at the bright - end .",
    "we find that the scatter around the cmr at the bright - end decreases from @xmath1 down to @xmath27 , while the scatter at the faint - end does not decrease clearly .",
    "that is , the bright - end of the cmr is built - up with time , while there is no clear cmr at the faint - end even at @xmath27 .",
    "secondly , we find on - going build - up of the cmr in groups .",
    "groups in rxj0153 show a cmr , but we find that the cmr is getting weak at @xmath28 .",
    "there are a number of red galaxies at @xmath28 , but they do not form a tight relation .",
    "the scatter around the cmr shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_scatter ] reflects this visual impression . at lower redshifts ,",
    "group galaxies show a clear relation down to the magnitude limit .",
    "this leads us to suggest that we are witnessing the build - up of the cmr in groups .",
    "an emerging picture is that the cmr grows from the bright - end to the faint - end , and not the opposite way .",
    "thirdly , no such on - going build - up of the cmr is seen in clusters .",
    "we can not see dramatic growth of the cmr in clusters .",
    "cluster galaxies show a clear cmr down to the magnitude limit at all redshifts considered here and the scatter around the cmr is already small at high redshifts .",
    "one may suspect that the observed build - up of the cmr is an artifact : e.g. , photometric redshifts miss a fraction of red galaxies in rxj0153 , and it mimics the cmr build - up .",
    "but , this is not the case .",
    "the accuracy of photometric redshifts does not depend on environment .",
    "accordingly , if there were a cmr in the field environments of rxj0153 , it would have been found because we see the clear cmr in the cluster environments . the same argument can be applied to the faint - end of the cmr in groups .",
    "it should be noted that our group environment is a composite of several individual groups , and hence a variation in group properties is not a major concern .",
    "note as well that photometric redshifts are reliable for red galaxies ( see figure [ fig : photoz_vs_specz ] ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the observed build - up is real .",
    "fourthly , the slope of the cmr does not change with environment .",
    "the slope of the cmr in the field environment is found to be similar to those in groups and clusters .",
    "this is quantified in figure [ fig : cm_slope ] .",
    "there is no convincing evidence that the cmr slope depends on environment .",
    "note that galaxy colours are measured within different aperture sizes at different redshifts : petrosian aperture in sdss and @xmath17 aperture in cl0016 and rxj0153 .",
    "cmr slopes change with aperture sizes @xcite , and we do not discuss the evolution of the cmr slope here .",
    "although cmr seems to be built - up at different epochs in different environments , this similarity of the cmr slope may be expected if the slope is primarily caused by the metallicity effect rather than the age effect @xcite .",
    "the observed cmr build - up suggests that the slope of cmr does not change since the formation epoch of the cmr .",
    "fifthly , we confirm bimodality in galaxy colours .",
    "galaxy properties are known to have strong bimodal distribution in the local universe @xcite .",
    "this bimodality is seen up to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we confirm the bimodality although it becomes less clearly seen at higher redshifts in all the environments .",
    "the bimodality is particularly noticeable in the field regions of cl0016 and sdss .",
    "high density environments lack blue galaxies .",
    "the highlight of this cmr analysis is that we observe the build - up of the cmr .",
    "it seems that an evolutionary stage of the cmr build - up is different in different environments : the cluster cmr is built first , and the cmrs of the group and field regions are built later on .",
    "another interesting implication is that the bright - end of the cmr appears first , and the faint - end is filled up later on .",
    "we will further quantify and discuss the observed build - up in  9.3 .",
    "0.3 0.3 0.3    0.7    1.0",
    "luminosity function ( lf ) is one of the most fundamental measures of galaxy properties .",
    "this section studies lfs as functions of environment and time .",
    "a lf is fitted by the schechter function @xcite of the form    @xmath29    or equivalently , per unit magnitude ,    @xmath30dm.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there are three parameters in the schechter function : the normalization factor @xmath31 , the characteristic luminosity / magnitude @xmath32 , and the faint - end slope @xmath33 .",
    "best - fit parameters are searched via the conventional @xmath34-minimizing statistics .",
    "galaxies in rxj0153 and cl0016 are binned into 0.5 magnitude steps , and those in the sdss are into @xmath35 magnitude steps .",
    "first , we examine total ( = red+blue ) lfs at each redshift .",
    "then we look into red / blue lfs in different environments and at different redshifts .      based on the photo-@xmath36 selected samples of rxj0153 and cl0016 and the spec-@xmath36 sample of sdss , the total lf of galaxies at each redshift is constructed and shown in figure [ fig : lf_tot ] . note that no statistical contamination subtraction is performed here .",
    "the schechter function gives a good fit ( @xmath37 ) to the total lf of for rxj0153 and cl0016 , but it is not a good fit for sdss ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the observed sdss lf deviates from the schechter function at the faint - end , and this deviation decreases the overall goodness of fit .",
    "the deviation is possibly due to increasing contribution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we fit the schechter function using galaxies with @xmath39 and obtain @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "we recall that the @xmath43 derived in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf_tot ] were used in separating bright / faint galaxies in  [ sec : colour - density ] . note that a small error in @xmath44 has little effect on the results obtained in that section .",
    "figure [ fig : lf_tot ] clearly shows that galaxies fade with time : @xmath45 at @xmath1 , @xmath46 at @xmath2 , and @xmath47 at @xmath27 .",
    "this observed fading , @xmath48 mag . from @xmath1 to @xmath27 and @xmath49 mag . from @xmath2 to @xmath27 , is consistent with a passive evolution model ( @xcite ; @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 mag . and 0.55 mag .",
    ", respectively , within the errors .",
    "this suggests that @xmath44 is primarily determined by passively evolving galaxies . in our cosmology ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond to a look - back time of 7.0 gyr and 5.4 gyr , respectively .",
    "the faint - end slope @xmath33 also seems to evolve .",
    "the number of faint galaxies relative to bright galaxies increases with time , @xmath52 at @xmath1 and @xmath53 at @xmath27 .",
    "but the local value should be taken with caution since @xmath33 is found to depend on the magnitude range involved in the schechter fit .",
    "contribution of dwarf galaxies is likely to be significant at the faint - end .",
    "we therefore do not try to draw any firm conclusion on the evolution of @xmath33 .    in rxj0153 and cl0016 fields",
    ", we have rich clusters and a number of groups , and the contribution of clusters and groups to the total lf is larger compared with the sdss lf . in the sdss sample , the field , group , and cluster galaxies comprise 80% , 13% , and 7% of the total number of galaxies .",
    "we scale the relative fraction of field , group , and cluster galaxies in rxj0153 and cl0016 to the sdss values , and find that the derived schechter parameters show only a small change : @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus , a different environmental mix of galaxies does not strongly change our results .",
    "the fact that galaxy properties have strong bimodality in their distribution motivates us to investigate lfs of red and blue galaxies separately .",
    "we define red galaxies as those having @xmath56 .",
    "blue galaxies are defined as those bluer than this limit .",
    "this definition is illustrated in figure [ fig : cm_rest ] .",
    "it should be noted that , in the following , the statistical contamination subtraction is performed on the lf bin  lf bin basis .",
    "this is different from the monte - carlo approach that we adopt in the previous sections .",
    "our results are presented in figure [ fig : lf_env ] .",
    "a general trend is that red galaxies have a decreasing or flat faint - end slope ( though exceptions can be found ) , while blue galaxies have an increasing slope at any redshift .",
    "some sdss data points at the faint - end deviate from the best - fit schechter function .",
    "this is because the sdss data at the faint - end have small weights in the schechter fitting due to the statistical nature of the volume correction .",
    "now , we focus on the lfs of red galaxies . at @xmath27 ,",
    "the faint - end slope becomes gradually less steep in denser environment .",
    "@xcite reported , based on sdss data , that faint red galaxies preferentially populate in high density environments .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite based on the 2df data .",
    "it is likely that red faint galaxies are selectively located in high density environments .",
    "a similar trend can be seen in rxj0153 , but it is not statistically significant given the large error ellipses .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite reported the deficit of red faint galaxies in high redshift ( @xmath9 ) clusters compared with local clusters .",
    "although we can not confirm the trend in the schechter parameter , we do see the the deficit of red faint galaxies in the giant - to - dwarf ratio , which we will discuss in the next section . as for blue lfs",
    ", there is no convincing evidence that blue lfs strongly depend on environment and time .    1.0    0.45 0.45 + 0.45",
    "galaxies in cl0016 show somewhat exceptional properties compared with other samples . for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf_env ] , the field environment in cl0016 has a strange red lf , and the group environment has an increasing faint - end slope for red galaxies .",
    "one may find that these lfs look different compared with other lfs .",
    "the fraction of red galaxies is the highest in all environments as we see later .",
    "there is a concern that this peculiarity may arise from errors in the statistical subtraction of contamination .",
    "we therefore check how the results for cl0016 can change by changing our choice of field regions used in the subtraction .",
    "we take either of the two field regions indicated by rectangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl0016_distrib ] separately , rather than combining these two fields .",
    "we then compare the resulting cmds and lfs for cl0016 after the statistical subtraction .",
    "this effectively corresponds to changing the field density by factor of @xmath57 . yet",
    ", we find no evidence that the results change strongly .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the peculiarity of the cl0016 cluster is intrinsic .",
    "cl0016 is probably one of the oldest systems in the universe where red faint galaxies are already abundant .",
    "indeed , @xcite illustrated the unusually low blue fraction of this cluster for its redshift .",
    "our environments are defined on the basis of local and global ( 2mpc ) density .",
    "it might be the case that even larger - scale environments ( e.g. , @xmath58 mpc ) can affect the galaxy properties ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "we regard cl0016 as an exceptional sample .",
    "the break density corresponds to the outskirts of galaxy clusters ( one to two @xmath59 ) and isolated groups .",
    "this means that groups and clusters are dominated by red galaxies and supports the idea that cluster - specific mechanisms have not played major roles in transforming galaxy properties ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "rather , mechanisms such as low - velocity galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and strangulation @xcite remain as strong candidates of the driver of the environmental dependence .    the fact that faint galaxies ( @xmath60 ) show",
    "the clear break suggests that physical mechanisms actually work on faint galaxies in high - density environments .",
    "then , why do not bright galaxies ( @xmath61 ) show any prominent break ?",
    "of course , bright galaxies are generally red and a break in their colours , if any , would be difficult to see .",
    "but , at least in the sdss plot in figure [ fig : colour_density ] , this is not the case .",
    "no break is seen even in the 25-th percentile of bright galaxies .",
    "this implies that the evolutionary path of bright galaxies is different from that of faint galaxies in such a way that the evolution of faint galaxies is strongly related to groups and clusters , while that of bright galaxies is not strongly related @xcite",
    ".    environmental dependence of galaxy properties is determined by _ a priori _ effects ( initial conditions ) and _ a posteriori _ effects ( environmental effects ) .",
    "recent near - ir studies such as _ k20 survey _ @xcite , _ fires _",
    "@xcite and part of _ goods _ @xcite revealed the existence of massive red galaxies at @xmath62 .",
    "although a significant fraction of such red galaxies are dusty starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , massive non - star - forming galaxies , which are presumably precursors of present - day ellipticals , do exist .",
    "since their colours match with passive evolution , their properties are expected to be largely determined by _ a priori _ effects and subsequent environmental effects are not very important .",
    "that is , their star formation rate is already low before environmental mechanisms play a role .",
    "these massive galaxies would evolve to bright galaxies in our definition , and would explain the trends observed in ",
    "[ sec : colour - density ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the deficit of red faint galaxies is a function of environment , in a way that red faint galaxies preferentially populate in high - density environments .",
    "therefore , we suggest that properties of bright galaxies are largely determined by _ a priori _ effects , while those of faint galaxies are largely determined by _ a posteriori _ effects .      in  [ sec : colour - magnitude ] , we observed the build - up of the cmr . to further quantify the build - up",
    ", we base our analysis on stellar masses of galaxies .",
    "if galaxies stop their star formation , they will be fainter ( @xmath63 ) while keeping their stellar masses nearly unchanged .",
    "since our stellar mass estimates are not very accurate , we can not examine a detailed shape of a stellar mass function .",
    "instead , we investigate the giant - to - dwarf number ratio ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "giants and dwarves are defined as those having @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for red galaxies at @xmath70 , and 0 , respectively .    since our estimates of stellar masses are primarily based on the the rest - frame @xmath71-band magnitudes , they are affected by recent / on - going star formation activities . in fact , as shown by the iso - mass curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_rest ] , the @xmath71-band magnitude can change by 1.5 mag . for the same stellar mass between passively evolving galaxies and the constantly star forming galaxies .",
    "this , which is then translated to the variation in mass - to - light ratio by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "this can be viewed as a solid upper limit of the uncertainties in @xmath73 in a relative sense , since we correct for such variation in mass - to - light ratio by applying sed fitting when deriving stellar masses ( note that absolute stellar masses depend on other factors such as the stellar initial mass function ) . moreover",
    ", since we mainly discuss the red galaxies , the actual variation in mass - to - light ratio must be much smaller ( less than a factor of 2 ) . in what follows ,",
    "we focus on the red galaxies only .",
    "we separately discuss field , group , and cluster environments .",
    "* field environment : * figure [ fig : gd_evolution ] shows @xmath64 in three different environments and at three different redshifts .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 clearly depends on both environment and time .",
    "a general trend is that @xmath64 is the largest in the field environment at any redshifts , suggesting that red faint galaxies is relatively rare in the field .",
    "this is consistent with our finding in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_rest ] that the faint - end of the field cmr is not clear .",
    "the field @xmath64 ratio is the largest in sdss .",
    "this is likely to be driven by the build - up of the bright - end of the field cmr ( i.e. , the fraction of giants increases ) .",
    "* group environment : * the @xmath64 ratio in groups is the largest in rxj0153 and it decreases at low redshifts .",

    "* cluster environment : * the cluster @xmath64 also shows the decrease at low redshifts .",
    "although we could not see prominent build - up of the cluster cmr in ",
    "[ sec : colour - magnitude ] , the @xmath64 evolution may suggest the faint - end of the cluster cmr is still under construction even at @xmath1 .",
    "it seems that the bright - end of the cmr appears first , and the faint - end is filled up later on .",
    "a likely scenario for this build - up is that blue galaxies stop their star formation and fade to settle down onto the cmr , and the truncation of star formation starts from bright ( massive ) galaxies .",
    "this scenario involves suppression of star formation activity in blue galaxies . how do blue galaxies in groups and field environments fade and settle exactly on the cmr as that of cluster galaxies ?",
    "we recall that we found no evidence for environmental dependence of the slope of the cmr .",
    "if the cmr is a product of the mass - metallicity relation @xcite , then blue galaxies have to know the metallicities of red galaxies they settle onto .",
    "since blue galaxies in the field and group environments should follow quite different star formation histories from those of red galaxies in clusters , one may expect that their metallicities are quite different .",
    "this is not the case , however .",
    "an important point here is that we are considering relatively massive ( @xmath74 ) galaxies .",
    "the cosmic star formation rate declines at @xmath75 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and therefore their major episode of star formation took place at higher redshifts .",
    "subsequent star formation does not strongly enrich metals in galaxies , and metals locked in their stars do not grow significantly after the major star formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , once galaxies mature , the epoch when they stop their star formation is not a major concern from a chemical point of view .",
    "whenever they stop their star formation , they will settle onto the cmr .    to further quantify the build - up of the cmr , we plot in figure [ fig : red_fraction ] the fraction of red galaxies as functions of environment , stellar mass , and time .",
    "as described in  3.3 , we can not deny the possibility that we miss a fraction of blue galaxies in rxj0153 and cl0016 .",
    "therefore , the real red fractions in rxj0153 and cl0016 would be smaller than those shown in the plot .",
    "we discuss the red fraction in the field , group , and cluster environments separately as follows .",
    "* field environment : * the massive galaxies show an increase in the red fraction , which is consistent with the build - up of the bright - end of the field cmr . on the other hand ,",
    "the least massive galaxies show a decrease .",
    "however , this may be because we tend to miss a fraction of blue galaxies in rxj0153 and cl0016 due to our photo - z selection .",
    "* group environment : * due to the relatively large errors , the red fraction of group galaxies is consistent with being unchanged with redshift .",
    "* cluster environment : * within the errors , red fraction is consistent with being almost constant over the time under study .",
    "this is in agreement with the trend that no significant cmr build - up is seen in clusters within the redshift range explored .",
    "there is an hint of evolution , however , at the least massive bin , where red fraction may increase from @xmath1 to lower redshifts .",
    "the overall trend is that the red fraction is the lowest in the field environment and higher in groups and clusters .",
    "but , in any environments and at any redshifts , the red fraction is higher for more massive galaxies .",
    "that is , the red fraction is higher in denser environment and for more massive galaxies .      from figs .",
    "[ fig : gd_evolution ] and [ fig : red_fraction ] , we consider that an evolutionary stage of the cmr build - up is different in different environments",
    ". the bright - end of the cluster cmr is already built by @xmath1 , and only the faint - end shows a possible evolution at @xmath76 . on the contrary , in the field regions ,",
    "the bright - end of the cmr is being vigorously built , while the build - up at the faint - end has not started yet .",
    "a possible interpretation of these results is that strong evolution has occurred since @xmath8 in a down - sizing way .",
    "it was @xcite who first pointed out the down - sizing galaxy evolution .",
    "at high redshifts , massive galaxies actively form stars . at lower redshifts ,",
    "massive galaxies show less active star formation and the main population of active star formation moves to less massive galaxies",
    ". the bright - end of the cmr is formed first as massive galaxies stop their star formation , and the build - up proceeds to the faint - end as less massive galaxies stop their star formation .",
    "our results suggest that the evolutionary stage of this down - sizing depends on environment .",
    "the evolution of massive cluster galaxies is almost completed by @xmath1 . in the field environment , the evolution of massive galaxies is strong , while that of less massive galaxies is found to be weak .",
    "therefore , it seems that the main population that shows strong evolution is shifted to higher mass galaxies in lower density environments .",
    "one of the drivers of the environmental dependence of the down - sizing could be initial conditions of galaxy formation ( _ a priori _ effects ) .",
    "galaxies are formed earlier in higher density peaks of the initial density fluctuation of the universe .",
    "thus , galaxies in clusters are naturally at an advanced stage of galaxy evolution compared with those in lower - density environments .",
    "this may explain the environmental dependence of the build - up of the cmr .",
    "we consider however that the environmental dependence of the down - sizing effect is not solely caused by the _ a priori _ effects , but environmental ( or _ a posteriori _ ) effects should contribute significantly .",
    "effects that suppress star formation activities are strong in high - density environments (  [ sec : colour - density ] ) , and they accelerate the build - up of the cmr .    we observed the build - up of the cmr at the faint - end in group environments .",
    "this should mean either that faint galaxies are still actively forming stars , or that less massive galaxies are not fully formed yet .",
    "we can not , however , discriminate these possibilities with the data in hand . to do this",
    ", we need to estimate stellar masses of faint blue galaxies accurately .",
    "further discussion on the driver of the cmr build - up awaits more accurate stellar mass estimates by near - infrared data .",
    "detailed observations of early - type galaxies suggest that the typical luminosity - weighted age of field early - type galaxies is younger than cluster galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "examined nearby early - type galaxies and suggested that formation of early - type galaxies is the earliest in high density environments and delayed by @xmath57 gyr in low density environments , and formation of massive galaxies predates that of less massive galaxies . utilizing near - ir data ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported that the epoch of major star formation took place at higher redshifts for more massive galaxies , and star formation is more extended in time for less massive galaxies .",
    "all these studies lend support to the down - sizing picture .",
    "we close our discussion by noting some caveats on our results .",
    "our results are based only on two high-@xmath36 clusters , which may not be a typical cluster at each redshift ( particularly cl0016 ) . to reach a firm conclusion ,",
    "we need to observe more clusters at various redshifts .",
    "also , errors in the photometric redshifts and stellar mass estimates remain as a concern .",
    "near - infrared ( e.g. , @xmath77-band ) data are required to improve them .",
    "spectroscopic data are clearly needed to further address the effectiveness of the photometric redshifts and assess errors in the statistical contamination subtraction .",
    "we hope to overcome these uncertainties in our future paper .    1.00    1.00",
    "we began this paper by introducing the three axes on which galaxy properties strongly depend , namely , environment , stellar mass , and time .",
    "we found that the star formation activity in galaxies is indeed dependent on all of these three axes and galaxies follow complicated evolutionary paths .",
    "we conducted multi - band imaging of two high-@xmath36 clusters , rxj0153 at @xmath1 and cl0016 at @xmath2 , with suprime - cam on subaru .",
    "these subaru data were combined with the sdss data ( @xmath27 ) , and we carried out statistical analyses of galaxy properties as functions of environment , mass , and time .",
    "we examined the colour - density relations , colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , and luminosity functions ( lfs ) of galaxies .",
    "first , we applied our photometric redshift technique to rxj0153 and cl0016 fields to largely eliminate fore-/background contamination and discovered large - scale structures surrounding the main clusters .",
    "details are described in @xcite .",
    "then we examined the relationship between galaxy colours and environments .",
    "it was found that galaxy colours abruptly change at the break density at any redshifts considered in this paper .",
    "faint galaxies ( @xmath3 ) show a prominent break , while bright galaxies ( @xmath78 ) do not show such a strong break .",
    "based on the break density , we defined three environments : field , group , and cluster .",
    "we examined cmds in the three environments .",
    "the highlight of the cmd analysis was to show how the cmr is built up as functions of time , environment and mass .",
    "there is no clear cmr in the field regions in rxj0153 , while a clear cmr can be seen in the same environment in cl0016 and sdss , particularly at the bright - end . in groups of rxj0153 ,",
    "a clear cmr is visible only at the bright - end ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the relation is found to extend down to our magnitude limit in groups of cl0016 and sdss .",
    "clusters have clear cmrs down to our magnitude limits at all redshifts considered here , with a possible remaining activity at the faint - end .",
    "these trends are quantified by the scatter of the cmrs .",
    "the build - up of the cmr was quantified by the giant - to - dwarf ratio ( @xmath64 ) and the red fraction . from @xmath1 to @xmath27 , the field @xmath64 increases and the group @xmath64 decreases , suggesting the cmr build - up at the bright - end in the field and at the faint - end in the group",
    ". the cluster @xmath64 also decreases .",
    "this may imply that the faint - end of the cluster cmr was still under construction at high redshifts .",
    "we found that the red fraction is higher in denser environment and for more massive galaxies .",
    "as a possible interpretation of these results , we suggested that galaxies evolve in the down - sizing way .",
    "that is , the main populations that host active star formation is shifted from massive galaxies to less massive galaxies with time .",
    "it is likely that an evolutionary stage of the down - sizing depends on environment .",
    "cluster galaxies evolve most rapidly , and group and field galaxies follow .",
    "all in all , it seems that galaxy evolution proceeds from massive galaxies to less massive galaxies , and from high density environments to low density environments . in order to confirm this trend ,",
    "however , further studies are obviously needed .",
    "we need to increase the cluster sample and also to perform follow - up observations such as nir imaging and spectroscopic surveys .",

    "in a flux - limited sample , intrinsically faint galaxies are observed only at low redshifts , while intrinsically bright galaxies can be observed at higher redshifts .",
    "for example , in our sdss sample , we can observe galaxies brighter than @xmath80 at all redshifts , while @xmath81 can be observed only at @xmath82 .",
    "we therefore need to correct for this incompleteness when we discuss galaxy properties . a simple way to do this is to give heavier statistical weights to intrinsically fainter galaxies according to their redshifts .",
    "a flux - limited sample can mimic a volume - limited one in this way .",
    "a statistical weight can be computed as    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is a statistical weight of @xmath85-th galaxy , @xmath86 is the volume contained within our redshift range ( @xmath87 ) , and @xmath88 is the maximum volume over which the @xmath85-th galaxy could be observed ( e.g. , in case of @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the volume contained within @xmath91 ) .",
    "we assume that a lf does not evolve within the surveyed redshift range .",
    "we can test effectiveness of this volume correction by simulating galaxy distribution with a given lf . for simplicity",

    "we examine a set of galaxy distribution here .    in the top panels of figure [ fig : vmax_sim ] ,",
    "we show a model of uniform galaxy distribution in a given volume , and the middle of the top panels shows a volume corrected lf . as seen in the panel , a lf is reconstructed well . in the middle panels , we set non - uniform galaxy distribution in a given volume .",
    "if galaxies are uniformly distributed in a given volume , we expect that the number of galaxies in a given radial shell scales as @xmath93 ( this is the case for the top panels ) .",
    "but , here we adopt the distribution such that @xmath94 is independent of @xmath95 . in this case , galaxies are not distributed uniformely in a volume , and a volume corrected lf does not reconstruct the parent lf .",
    "this is expected  the volume correction assumes the uniform galaxy distribution over a survey volume .",
    "the bottom panels show another example , where radial galaxy distribution has gaps. the volume correction again fails to reproduce the parent lf .    therefore , we take into account variations in radial galaxy distribution such as large - scale structures when we perform the volume correction . in our sample ,",
    "galaxies having @xmath96 can be observed regardless of redshift ( i.e. , volume - limited ) .",
    "we use these galaxies to correct for the radial variation .",

    "this appendix describes the statistical contamination subtraction procedure in detail .",
    "see figure [ fig : field_sub ] for help .",
    "we use the control field sample defined in  [ sec : field_sub ] to subtract the contamination . for simplicity , in this appendix , we refer to the control field sample as field sample . the field sample examined in the main text should be considered as a target sample here .",
    "let us pick up a galaxy in a target cmd .",
    "we move on to a cmd of field galaxies , and pin down a point where our target galaxy should lie ( i.e. , magnitude and colour of the galaxy we picked up ) .",
    "then we draw a circle ( strictly speaking , ellipse ) around the point on the field cmd , and count field galaxies that fall in the circle .",
    "the above procedure is performed for all target galaxies , and then we know how many times a field galaxy is counted by the target galaxies . we define a statistical weight for a field galaxy as an inverse of its count .",
    "for example , if a field galaxy is counted three times ( i.e. , three target galaxies share the field galaxy ) , the statistical weight of the field galaxy is 1/3 .",
    "then we define a probability for a target galaxy to be a field galaxy as the ratio of the sum of statistical weights of field galaxies in the circle of the target galaxy to the total number of field galaxies .",
    "we randomly pick up a target galaxy , throw a dice , and determine if the target galaxy is a field galaxy or not according to its field probability .",
    "we repeat this procedure until we subtract sufficient number of galaxies . in short ,",
    "this procedure can be considered as a generalized form of the grid - based method @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that since we make no grids , we are free from an uncertainty on how we make the grids . also note that we are free from the negative galaxy problem which the grid - based method faces .",
    "there are two parameters in our method , namely , the radius and the shape of the aperture within which we count field galaxies .",
    "the aperture we actually use is shown in figure [ fig : field_sub ] .",
    "it should be noted that our results do not depend on the size and shape of the aperture in reasonable ranges .",
    "how many galaxies should we subtract ?",
    "when we have galaxies that occupy surface area of @xmath102 , we expect the contamination to be @xmath103 galaxies , where @xmath104 is an average surface density of field galaxies .",
    "since we define environment by galaxy density , it is not very straightforward to estimate a surface area occupied by density - selected galaxies .",
    "we infer a surface area by a simple approximation . because an inverse of a galaxy density means an average surface area occupied by a galaxy ( i.e. , unit of @xmath105 ) , a sum of an inverse of density gives a surface area :    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is local density and @xmath85 runs through 1st to @xmath108-th galaxy we select .",
    "we show in appendix [ app : conversion ] that this estimate is statistically robust .",
    "a poisson error is then added in @xmath109 in each monte - carlo realization of the contamination subtraction .",
    "1.0    we check if our statistical contamination subtraction technique properly subtracts field galaxies",
    ". we examine if subtracted target galaxies reproduce the cmd of field galaxies . figure [ fig : consistency2 ]",
    "plots distribution of subtracted target galaxies on a cmd projected onto 1 dimensional space for clarity .",
    "it can be seen that the distribution of subtracted galaxies closely follows that of field galaxies .",
    "the very small difference between them is due to the fact that we apply a smoothing of the galaxy distribution on the field cmd when we estimate field probabilities ( the size and shape of the aperture determines the smoothing scale ) . despite the small difference",
    "we see a fairly good correspondence , and we therefore conclude that our subtraction method properly removes the field contamination .    1.0",
    "in appendix [ app : field_sub ] , we have converted from local density to a surface area that is occupied by density - selected galaxies .",
    "we examine validity of this approximation in this section .",
    "we construct a simple toy model of galaxy cluster and investigate differences between the real ( metric ) area and the area estimated from density .",
    "our toy model consists of uniform field galaxies and cluster galaxies whose distribution follows the king model @xcite .",
    "we randomly generate galaxies and estimate density for each galaxy by the nearest - neighbor method used in this paper .",
    "galaxies within a fixed aperture around the cluster is selected .",
    "then we compare the area of the aperture ( @xmath110 ) with the area estimated from densities of galaxies within the aperture ( @xmath111 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : density2area ] ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath112 in each realization and repeat 1000 times .",
    "there are two parameters in the model : the radius of the aperture , and the fraction of cluster galaxies to field galaxies in the aperture .    as a fiducial value ,",
    "the aperture radius is set to @xmath113 ( @xmath114 means the core radius of the king model ) .",
    "figure [ fig : density_area ] plots @xmath112 against the number ratio of cluster galaxies to field galaxies in the aperture .",
    "the result is encouraging ",
    "@xmath112 is almost unity . in the density calculation ,",
    "the distance to n - th nearest galaxy is used ( @xmath115 and 10 is adopted in the main text ) .",
    "we run the simulation using @xmath116 , and find that there is a weak trend that the scatter in @xmath112 decreases with increasing @xmath117 , but the median is always close to unity .",
    "our choice of the aperture radius seems to have a rather strong effect .",
    "the scatter in @xmath112 increases as we adopt smaller aperture ( e.g. , @xmath118 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we adopt larger aperture , say @xmath119 , the scatter reduces to almost half .",
    "however , in any case , the median @xmath112 is always close to unity .",

    "we run the friends - of - friends algorithm ( fofa ; @xcite ) in our sdss sample to find galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "the fofa is a famous group / cluster finding algorithm and its statistical properties are well - known @xcite .",
    "the basic algorithm of the fofa is to find a set of galaxies connected within certain linking lengths from each other .",
    "there are two linking lengths , namely , an angular separation ( @xmath120 ) and a line - of - sight velocity difference ( @xmath121 ) . since galaxy systems are elongated along the line - of - sight in the redshift space ( finger of god effect ) , we need to handle @xmath120 and @xmath121 separately .",
    "we run the fofa in a volume - limited sample defined by @xmath122 and @xmath123 so that we do not have to apply any scaling in the linking lengths .",
    "the fofa parameters are set to @xmath120=700kpc and @xmath124 .",
    "these values are slightly different from those adopted in @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are not , however , strongly dependent on the choice of the parameters .",
    "there is one more parameter , @xmath125 , which determines the minimum size of galaxy systems .",
    "if a system has members less than @xmath125 , the system is not considered here .",
    "we set @xmath126 as in @xcite since a significant fraction of @xmath127 groups are expected to be spurious @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ngal_vs_global ] we present a correlation between the number of member galaxies ( @xmath94 ) of the fofa systems and global density of the member galaxies .",
    "the correlation is encouragingly good  there is a positive correlation between the two quantities , especially at @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129 systems show only a weak correlation .",
    "this is probably because that a typical extent of such poor systems is smaller than 2mpc and a number fluctuation of field galaxies contribute to global density .",
    "as for @xmath128 , cluster members dominate the 2mpc aperture and hence we have a good correlation there .",
    "a few systems that have small @xmath94 with high global density can be seen .",
    "they are either parts of rich systems accidentally splitted by the fofa or real isolated systems close to nearby rich systems .",
    "they comprise only a small fraction and the effect of such contamination is negligible . in summary ,",
    "global density is a powerful tool to separate groups from clusters quantitatively .",
    "we measure velocity dispersions of detected systems using the biweight estimator @xcite . by examining the relationship between @xmath94 and a velocity dispersion of a system ( @xmath130 ) , we find that the global density threshold used in the main text for the sdss , @xmath131 , roughly corresponds to systems having @xmath132 . therefore , our groups typically have @xmath133 and clusters have @xmath134 ."
