    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite is an area of physics which deals with the quantization of symmetry reduced gravitational systems by adopting similar methods to those employed in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the kinematical structure underlying lqc was rigorously established for the first time for the simplest of all the cosmological models , namely , those describing a homogeneous , isotropic , and spatially flat geometry @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the dynamics of such a kind of geometry in the presence of a massless and minimally coupled scalar field has shown that the big bang singularity is resolved dynamically and is replaced by a quantum bounce @xcite .",
    "lqc has been further extended , with diverse levels of rigor , to other similar models with different topology @xcite or nonvanishing cosmological constant @xcite , and furthermore to more general settings such as anisotropic systems @xcite , or even to inhomogeneous situations @xcite .",
    "the robustness of the singularity resolution features has been confirmed within an exactly solvable version of lqc @xcite , and the mathematical foundations of its elements have been discussed @xcite .",
    "in addition to the studies of the genuine quantum theory , there exists an extensive amount of work at the level of the effective classical dynamics @xcite , which provides important insights into the properties of the quantum geometry in cosmological scenarios @xcite .",
    "so far , all the analyses of the dynamics carried out in the genuine quantum theory have employed partial observables parameterized by an emergent time . in most of the models considered in the literature @xcite , the role of time",
    "was played by a massless scalar field , which ( unlike the geometry degrees of freedom ) was quantized adopting a standard schroedinger - like representation .",
    "however , in many cases ( vacuum homogeneous universes , black hole interiors ) such possibility is not at hand . in this article",
    ", we overcome this difficulty by constructing and studying the properties of various families of unitarily related observables parameterized by the geometry degrees of freedom . as an appropriate test bed for our analysis , we study a model of a vacuum homogeneous universe of the bianchi i type .",
    "the bianchi i system itself has been extensively analyzed in the literature .",
    "after a preliminary analysis of the kinematics @xcite , an attempt to quantize the model was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the corresponding effective dynamics was studied in ref .",
    "there , however , a homogeneous massless scalar field was coupled as matter content and identified as an internal time .",
    "more recently , the system in vacuo has been thoroughly quantized @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the studies were restricted to the model with the compact three - torus ( @xmath2 ) topology , in order to provide a basis for further studies of a much more general system , namely the inhomogeneous gowdy @xmath2 model with linear polarization @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite both the physical hilbert space and a complete algebra of observables were constructed ; nonetheless the dynamics of the system was not investigated .",
    "let us comment that the extension of a quantization prescription known as improved dynamics from the isotropic to the anisotropic setting in homogenous lqc has given rise to the proposal of two concurrent prescriptions for bianchi i. in this article , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the prescription proposed in ref .",
    "for noncompact models and just in the form presented in that paper , that prescription is not invariant under certain transformations @xcite , but for compact models , including the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the prescription is free from this drawback .",
    "the desired invariance is recovered in noncompact situations with an alternative prescription , which was recently developed and motivated in ref .",
    "@xcite appealing to the hypothesized relationship between the degrees of freedom of lqc and full lqg . for our discussion , nonetheless , the following reasons explain our use of the former of these prescriptions . @xmath3",
    "the goal of our work is a methodological development of a formalism of unitary evolution , defining it in a precise manner without introducing an additional matter field as a clock . for that purpose , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is a better candidate , as the structure of the hilbert space and the properties of the states are known in detail and have been presented in the literature , something which is necessary to establish the link between physical intuition and the exact mathematical implementation of our method . @xmath4 the specific properties of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite allow to study the limitations of applicability of some of the constructed methods ( see in particular fig .",
    "[ fig : v1-v2-comp ] and the related discussion in subsec .",
    "[ sec : v - results ] ) , limitations which would have been missed had one used the model of ref .",
    "@xmath5 our construction , although applied here to a concrete model , is intended to be reasonably universal . in particular , it is almost directly applicable to other possible prescriptions for the quantization of the bianchi i model , including that of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see the discussion in sec . [",
    "sec : results ] ) .    employing the knowledge accumulated in previous works about the properties of the selected model , and the explicit and complete quantization chosen for it",
    ", we will analyze here two possible constructions of families of unitarily related observables , which are respectively parameterized by : @xmath0 a coefficient of the densitized triad , and @xmath1 the variable conjugate to it .",
    "for the sake of clarity in the presentation , as well as for comparing the predictions of geometrodynamics and lqc , we will apply the construction to both the lqc version of the model and its wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) counterpart .",
    "we will see that , whereas in a wdw - type quantization our construction with respect to both of the specified parameters provides observables with a precise physical interpretation , in the loop quantization scheme this property is achieved only in an approximate sense .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy of the interpretation depends only on properties of the state in case @xmath1 , while for @xmath0 the dependence is also on the evolution epoch .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : framework ] is a review of the lqc quantization of ref .",

    "[ sec : wdw - analog ] we perform the wdw quantization of the model and develop an interpretation for the evolution of observables for the two considered choices of internal time . in sec .",

    "in this section we briefly review the basic features of the polymerically quantized vacuum bianchi i model .",
    "it is a summary of the main results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which the reader can consult for further details .",
    "the bianchi i model represents spatially flat and homogeneous spacetimes . we will consider the case of a compact topology : that of a three - torus",
    ". the spacetime metric can be written in the form @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fiducial co - triad , @xmath8 is the lapse function , and @xmath9 are the nontrivial components of the densitized triad in a diagonal gauge .",
    "the corresponding components of the ashtekar connection are @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the newton constant and @xmath13 is the immirzi parameter ( that we assume positive for simplicity ) .",
    "owing to homogeneity , the only constraint present in the model is the hamiltonian one , given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the spacetime volume .",
    "classically , any of the triad coefficients @xmath16 is a monotonous function of the time coordinate @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spacetime presents a curvature singularity at initial time @xmath18 , at which the universe stretches as an infinitely long line .      in lqc",
    "the basic configuration variables are holonomies of connections .",
    "the holonomy along an edge of oriented coordinate length @xmath19 in the direction @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the @xmath23 generators proportional to the pauli matrices , such that @xmath24=\\epsilon_{ijk}\\tau^k$ ] .",
    "the configuration algebra @xmath25 is the algebra of almost periodic functions of @xmath26 , which is generated by the matrix elements of the holonomies @xmath27 . in the momentum representation ,",
    "the states defined by these matrix elements are denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the completion of the algebra @xmath25 with respect to the discrete inner product @xmath29 for each fiducial direction provides the kinematical hilbert space @xmath30 .",
    "the elementary operators are the operators @xmath31 associated with fluxes , which are diagonal on the basis states @xmath28 of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , whose action shifts the label @xmath34 of the considered basis by @xmath35 .    in order to express @xmath36 in terms of holonomies , instead of connections components ,",
    "one introduces the curvature tensor associated with the ashtekar connection and defines it as in gauge lattice theories . with this aim ,",
    "one considers a loop of holonomies and shrinks its area to its minimum value , which is nonzero owing to the discreteness of the area spectrum in lqg . to determine the minimum @xmath37 for the coordinated length of the holonomy we assume ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) square loops of fiducial area @xmath38 with minimum physical area equal to @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being the planck length .",
    "this implies that @xmath41 in the sense of operators @xcite . on the other hand , one appeals to the so called `` thiemann s trick '' to define a well - defined inverse volume operator @xmath42}$ ] . as a final result one obtains a quantum hamiltonian constraint @xmath43 expressed in terms of our basic operators and which is well - defined in the domain @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "owing to the relation @xmath41 , the shift produced by the operator @xmath44 on the basis states @xmath28 is not constant .",
    "one can nevertheless relabel these states with an affine parameter @xmath45 and @xmath46 in such a way that it annihilates the subspace spanned by the `` zero - volume '' states , i.e. the states @xmath47 with any @xmath48 equal to zero , and leaves invariant its orthogonal complement .",
    "for the nontrivial solutions to the constraint , we can thus restrict our study to that complement . owing to this restriction",
    "the singularity is resolved at the kinematical level @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to densitize the hamiltonian constraint to find its solutions .",
    "the densitized hamiltonian constraint is given by the operator @xmath49}^{-\\frac1{2 } } \\widehat{c}_{\\text{bi } } \\widehat{\\left[\\frac{1}{v}\\right]}^{-\\frac1{2}},\\ ] ] which is well - defined in the considered domain ( linear span of tensor products of states @xmath50 such that none of the @xmath48 s vanishes ) .",
    "the bijection @xmath51}{}^{1/2}$ ] in the dual of that domain relates the nontrivial solutions @xmath52 of @xmath53 to the solutions @xmath54 of its densitized version @xmath55 .",

    "if we choose , for instance , a positive orientation for the triad in the three fiducial directions , we can restrict our study to the kinematical hilbert space @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .      in order to obtain the physical hilbert space ,",
    "it is enough to analyze the spectral properties of the operator @xmath57 .",
    "it can be proven essentially self - adjoint with domain the dense set @xmath68 . in consequence",
    ", @xmath55 is essentially self - adjoint in the invariant domain @xmath69 .",
    "this property allows us to apply the group averaging method @xcite to determine the physical hilbert space @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of @xmath57 is absolutely continuous , coincides with the real line and is nondegenerate .",
    "furthermore , the coefficients @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) of its generalized eigenfunctions with eigenvalue @xmath73 turn out to be determined just by the initial data @xmath74 [ see ref .",
    "@xcite for the explicit expression -eq .",
    "( 45)- ] .",
    "these eigenfunctions are formed by two components , one of them with support in the semilattice of step four @xmath75 and the other in the displaced semilattice @xmath76 both of these components are generalized eigenfunctions with eigenvalue @xmath77 of the operator @xmath78 , which is proportional to the gravitational part of the densitized constraint in the isotropic case .",
    "these components have a relative phase of @xmath79 and , hence , @xmath80 oscillates rapidly when @xmath48 varies in the semilattice @xmath81 .    applying the group averaging procedure",

    "in this section we will study the quantization of the vacuum bianchi i model in the wdw approach formulated in terms of the connection coefficients , which will be treated in a standard ( non - polymeric ) way .",
    "like in the loop quantization , we will work in the triad representation .",
    "as kinematical hilbert space of the wdw quantization we take @xmath87 with @xmath88 @xcite . the measure is the usual lebesgue measure , and not the discrete one . in this representation",
    "the operator @xmath31 acts by multiplication by the factor @xmath89 , just as in the loop quantization . on the other hand",
    ", we promote the connection coefficients to derivative operators , @xmath90 to preserve the dirac rule @xmath91=i\\hbar\\widehat{\\{c^i , p_j\\}}$ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath92 the counterpart of the classical quantity @xmath93 in the wdw quantum theory [ defined on the schwartz space @xmath94 .",
    "we choose for @xmath92 the symmetric factor ordering which is analog to that used in the loop quantization , to simplify the comparison with it : @xmath95\\sqrt{|v_i|}.\\ ] ] it is well defined in the distributional sense and can be rewritten in the simpler form @xmath96 , where we have disregarded the noncontributing term @xmath97 .",
    "then , the wdw quantum counterpart of the classical densitized hamiltonian constraint can be constructed exclusively from the operator @xmath92 in the following manner @xmath98.\\ ] ]    the operator @xmath92 is essentially self - adjoint on @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , its restrictions to each of the subspaces @xmath100 are essentially self - adjoint as well .",
    "on each of these subspaces , the spectrum of @xmath92 is absolutely continuous , coincides with the real line and is nondegenerate , as happens to be the case with its analog @xmath57 in the loop quantization .",
    "moreover , its generalized eigenfunctions , with generalized eigenvalue @xmath73 , have the form @xmath101 .",
    "they provide an orthonormal basis for @xmath102 . in analogy with the procedure followed in the loop quantization , we will restrict the study to @xmath103 .",
    "as in the lqc model @xcite , the operators @xmath106 ( here @xmath107 ) , which multiply the wave function by @xmath108 , together with @xmath109 .",
    "nonetheless , while the first pair are dirac observables which correspond to classical constants of motion , the second one are not . as a consequence , this set turns out not to be adequate to introduce a nontrivial concept of evolution . in the next subsection , we will construct another pair of dirac observables that will complete the set formed by @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) , and in terms of which we will be able to develop an interpretation for the notion of evolution .      in any gravitational system ,",
    "as the one considered here , the hamiltonian is constrained to vanish .",
    "therefore , there is no well defined notion of evolution in the model .",
    "nonetheless , one can try to select , in the configuration space , a coordinate @xmath17 ( an internal time ) and define a map between hilbert spaces @xmath110 , where @xmath17 takes values in a certain set @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the space of `` initial data '' given by the restriction of the wave function to the surface @xmath113 .",
    "if there exists a unitary transformation @xmath114 , then each @xmath17-slice contains all the information needed to determine the physical state ( i.e. the system is closed ) .",
    "furthermore , if , in addition , the `` identity '' map between the spaces @xmath112 ( given by the trivial identification of data at different times ) is also unitary , one can define a unitary evolution in @xmath112 .",
    "this is achieved by composing the inverse transformation @xmath115 , a transformation in the family @xmath116 ( for a different value of @xmath17 ) , and the above identification of data .    in our case , since classically any of the three triad components is monotonous along all the dynamical trajectories , one can select one of the @xmath48 s as an internal time . taking into account that in the description of the physical states we have already eliminated @xmath117 in terms of @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    ", it is then most natural to choose @xmath120 .                  since @xmath130 is unitary and the spaces @xmath131",
    "coincide ( so that the corresponding map identifying states at different values of @xmath132 is unitary as well ) , it is clear that @xmath130 leads to a unitary evolution for the system .",
    "a more elaborated manner of providing a concept of evolution is by introducing a family of _ partial observables _",
    "@xcite , which are to be related via unitary transformations .",
    "a natural construction of partial observables from the kinematical ones is available if there exists an internal time which provides a unitary map between initial data spaces . on the formal level",
    ", one can do this through the group averaging procedure .",
    "alternatively , if there exists a decomposition @xmath133 ( where @xmath134 is some hilbert space of functions depending on @xmath17 only)@xcite and there is an operator @xmath135 , one can build @xmath136 ( which measures the corresponding quantity `` at a given time @xmath17 '' ) as an operator whose action is defined through the following sequence of operations :    a.   take an initial data slice @xmath137 corresponding to the value @xmath17 of an emergent time .",
    "+ in many cases the spaces @xmath112 differ from @xmath138",
    ". therefore one has to define a transformation @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "b.   then act with the `` kinematical '' observable @xmath140 corresponding to the measured quantity , and [ it : obs - pkin ] c.   use the relation between physical and slice hilbert spaces to find the element of @xmath141 corresponding to the result of .    in the model under study , the above method can be applied for example to the kinematical observable @xmath142 ( where @xmath107 ) , which acts on elements of @xmath143 as a multiplication operator .",
    "as the internal time coordinate we still choose @xmath132 , so that @xmath144 , given by eq . .",
    "the space @xmath138 is the product @xmath145          employing the transformations between the introduced hilbert spaces , we finally obtain a family of observables @xmath152 acting on the physical hilbert space , interpretable as `` the value of @xmath153 at the fixed time @xmath132 '' .",
    "the operators are well defined on the schwartz space @xmath154 .",
    "their action in this domain , which can be deduced taking into account that they act by multiplication on the corresponding kinematical states @xmath155 , turns out to be            observables .",
    "whereas within each family ( corresponding to @xmath107 respectively ) the observables @xmath158 do not change with @xmath132 , the observables @xmath152 do not coincide , and are related at different times @xmath132 and @xmath159 via an operator @xmath160 such that @xmath161 ( \\omega_2,\\omega_3 ) = \\sqrt{\\frac{v_1}{v_1^\\star } } \\frac{\\underline e_{\\omega_1}(v_1 ) } { \\underline e_{\\omega_1}(v_1^\\star ) } \\underline{\\tilde\\phi}(\\omega_2,\\omega_3).\\ ] ] the form of the eigenfunction implies immediately , that these operators are both invertible ( @xmath162 ) and unitary on @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the relation between observables at different times , @xmath163 is unitary .    as a consequence ,",

    "in contrast , as we will see in subsec . [ sec : pre - v - obs ] , the direct application of the above construction in the loop quantization does not lead to a unitary evolution since , in that case , the analogs of @xmath164 fail to be unitary operators .",

    "<S> when no such a suitable clock field is present , we explore different constructions of families of unitarily related partial observables . </S>",
    "<S> these observables are parameterized , respectively , by : @xmath0 one of the components of the densitized triad , and @xmath1 its conjugate momentum ; each of them playing the role of an evolution parameter . exploiting the properties of the considered example , we investigate in detail the domains of applicability of each construction . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the observables possess a neat physical interpretation only in an approximate sense . </S>",
    "<S> however , whereas in case @xmath0 such interpretation is reasonably accurate only for a portion of the evolution of the universe , in case @xmath1 it remains so during all the evolution ( at least in the physically interesting cases ) . </S>",
    "<S> the constructed families of observables are next used to describe the evolution of the bianchi i universe . </S>",
    "<S> the performed analysis confirms the robustness of the bounces , also in absence of matter fields , as well as the preservation of the semiclassicality through them . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of evolution studied here and the presented construction of observables are applicable to a wide class of models in lqc , including quantizations of the bianchi i model obtained with other prescriptions for the improved dynamics . </S>"
