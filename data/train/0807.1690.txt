    "since the extensive study of @xcite revealed the systematic appearance of multiple zeta values as the result of feynman diagram computations in perturbative quantum field theory , the question of finding a direct relation between feynman diagrams and periods of motives has become a rich field of investigation .",
    "the formulation of feynman integrals that seems most suitable for an algebro - geometric approach is the one involving schwinger and feynman parameters , as in that form the integral acquires directly an interpretation as a period of an algebraic variety , namely the complement of a hypersurface in a projective space constructed out of the combinatorial information of a graph .",
    "these graph hypersurfaces and the corresponding periods have been investigated in the algebro - geometric perspective in the recent work of bloch  esnault  kreimer ( @xcite , @xcite ) and more recently , from the point of view of hodge theory , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , the question of whether only motives of mixed tate type would arise in the quantum field theory context is still unsolved . despite the general result of @xcite , which shows that the graph hypersurfaces are general enough from the motivic point of view to generate the grothendieck ring of varieties , the particular results of @xcite and @xcite point to the fact that , even though the varieties themselves are very general , the part of the cohomology that supports the period of interest to quantum field theory might still be of the mixed tate form .",
    "one complication involved in the algebro - geometric computations with graph hypersurfaces is the fact that these are typically singular , with a singular locus of small codimension .",
    "it becomes then an interesting question in itself to estimate how singular the graph hypersurfaces are , across certain families of feynman graphs ( the half open ladder graphs , the wheels with spokes , the banana graphs etc . ) .",
    "since the main goal is to describe what happens at the motivic level , one wants to have invariants that detect how singular the hypersurface is and that are also somehow adapted to its decomposition in the grothendieck ring of motives . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on a particular example and illustrate some general methods for computing such invariants based on the theory of characteristic classes of singular varieties .",
    "part of the purpose of the present paper is to familiarize physicists working in perturbative quantum field theory with some techniques of algebraic geometry that are useful in the analysis of graph hypersurfaces .",
    "thus , we try as mush as possible to spell out everything in detail and recall the necessary background .    in  [ introsec ] , we begin by recalling the general form of the parametric feynman integrals for a scalar field theory and the construction of the associated projective graph hypersurface .",
    "we recall the relation between the graph hypersurface of a planar graph and that of the dual graph via the standard cremona transformation",
    ". we then present the specific example of the infinite family of `` banana graphs '' .",
    "we formulate a positivity conjecture for the characteristic classes of graph hypersurfaces .    for the convenience of the reader , we recall in  [ grcsmdefsec ] some general facts and results , both about the grothendieck ring of varieties and motives , and about the theory of characteristic classes of singular algebraic varieties .",
    "we outline the similarities and differences between these constructions .",
    "in  [ motsect ] we give the explicit computation of the classes in the grothendieck ring of the hypersurfaces of the banana graphs .",
    "we conclude with a general remark on the relation between the class of the hypersurface of a planar graph and that of a dual graph .    in  [ csmsect ] we obtain an explicit formula for the chern  schwartz ",
    "macpherson classes of the hypersurfaces of the banana graphs .",
    "we first prove a general pullback formula for these classes , which is necessary in order to compute the contribution to the csm class of the complement of the algebraic simplex in the graph hypersurface .",
    "the formula is then obtained by assembling the contribution of the intersection with the algebraic simplex and of its complement via inclusion  exclusion , as in the case of the classes in the grothendieck ring .",
    "we give then , in  [ conessect ] , a formula for the csm classes of cones on hypersurfaces and use them to obtain formulae for graph hypersurfaces obtained from known one by simple operations on the graphs , such as doubling or splitting an edge , and attaching single - edge loops or trees to vertices .    finally , in ",
    "[ ncqftsect ] , we look at the deformations of ordinary @xmath0 theory to a noncommutative spacetime given by a moyal space .",
    "we look at the ribbon graphs that correspond to the original banana graphs in this noncommutative quantum field theory .",
    "we explain the relation between the graph hypersurfaces of the noncommutative theory and of the original commutative one .",
    "we show by an explicit computation of csm classes that in noncommutative qft the positivity conjecture fails for non - planar ribbon graphs",

    "i.e. _  the collections of @xmath21 edges that divide the graph @xmath3 in exactly two connected components @xmath22 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath23 is a function of the external momenta attached to the vertices in either one of the two components @xmath24 where the @xmath25 are defined as @xmath26 where the @xmath27 are incoming external momenta attached to the external edges of @xmath3 and satisfying the conservation law @xmath28    the divergence properties of the integral can be estimated in terms of the `` superficial degree of divergence '' , which is measured by the quantity @xmath29 .",
    "the integral is called logarithmically divergent when @xmath30 .",
    "the example of the banana graphs we concentrate on below has @xmath31 , so that we find @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in this case",
    ", we write the integral in the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the volume form and the domain of integration is the topological simplex @xmath37    the 1pi condition on feynman graphs comes from the fact of considering the perturbative expansion of the effective action in quantum field theory , which reduces the combinatorics of graphs to just those that are connected and 1pi . in terms of the expression of the feynman integral , the 1pi condition is reflected in the fact that only the propagators for internal edges appear .",
    "the parametric form we described above therefore depends on this assumption .",
    "however , for the algebro - geometric arguments that constitute the main content of this paper , the 1pi condition is not strictly necessary .",
    "the graph polynomial @xmath38 of also admits a description as determinant @xmath39 of an @xmath40-matrix @xmath41 associated to the graph ( @xcite ,  3 and @xcite ,  18 ) , of the form @xmath42 where the @xmath43-matrix @xmath44 is defined in terms of the edges @xmath45 and a choice of a basis for the first homology group , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , by setting @xmath48 -1 & \\text{edge $ e_i\\in$ loop $ l_k$ , reverse orientation } \\\\[2 mm ] 0 & \\text{otherwise , } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] after choosing an orientation of the edges .",
    "notice how the result is independent of the choice of the orientation of the edges and of the choice of the basis of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , a change of orientation in a given edge results in a change of sign to one of the columns of the matrix @xmath49 , which is compensated by the change of sign in the corresponding row of the matrix @xmath50 , so that the determinant @xmath51 is unaffected . similarly , a change in the choice of the basis of @xmath10 has the effect of changing @xmath52 for some @xmath53 and the determinant is again unchanged .",
    "the graph hypersurface @xmath54 is by definition the zero locus of the kirchhoff polynomial , @xmath55 since @xmath11 is homogeneous , it defines a hypersurface in projective space .",
    "the domain of integration @xmath56 defines a cycle in the relative homology @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the algebraic simplex ( the union of the coordinate hyperplanes , see below ) .",
    "the feynman integral , then can be viewed ( @xcite,@xcite ) as the evaluation of an algebraic cohomology class in @xmath59 on the cycle defined by @xmath56 . in this sense",
    ", it can be viewed as the evaluation of a period of the algebraic variety given by the complement of the graph hypersurface . to understand the nature of this period ,",
    "one is faced with two main problems .",
    "one is eliminating divergences ( regularization and renormalization of feynman integrals ) , and the other is understanding what kind of motives are involved in the part of the hypersurface complement @xmath60 that is involved in the evaluation of the period , hence what kind of transcendental numbers one expects to find in the evaluation of the corresponding feynman integrals .",
    "a detailed analysis of these problems was carried out in @xcite .",
    "the examples we concentrate on in this paper are not especially interesting from the motivic point of view , since they are expressible in terms of pure tate motives ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) , but they provide us with an infinite family of graphs for which all computations are completely explicit .      in the case of _ planar _ graphs , there is an interesting relation between the hypersurface of the graph and the one of the dual graph",

    "the following direct construction streamlines such computations , by avoiding any computation of local invariants or of euler characteristics .",
    "this is observed in @xcite and @xcite , where it is used to provide an alternative proof of the grothendieck - deligne conjecture , and as the basis of a generalization of the functoriality of csm classes to possibly non - proper morphisms .",

    "this relation is very reminiscent of the basic relation that holds in the grothendieck group of varieties ( see   [ grdefsec ] ) . at the same time , csm classes satisfy a ` product formula ' analogous to the definition of product in the grothendieck ring ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "the latter is a line in the @xmath169 case and a cone on a nonsingular conic in the case @xmath95 .      as a further example of why it is useful to compute invariants such as the csm classes for the graph hypersurfaces ,",
    "we show that the csm class of the hypersurface defined by the polynomial detects the special values of the deformation parameter @xmath541 where the hypersurface @xmath555 becomes more singular and gives a quantitative estimate of the amount by which the singularities change .",

    "however , in doing so one should be aware of the fact that the csm class of an affine variety , defined by choosing an embedding in a larger compact ambient variety , depends on the choice of the embedding . an intrinsic definition of csm classes for non - compact varieties which does not depend on the embedding was given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , for our purposes here it suffices to take the simpler viewpoint of making the equation homogeneous and then computing csm classes .",

    "although it seems unlikely that planarity will play a role in the conjectured positivity of the coefficients of the csm classes in the ordinary case , the example above showing that csm classes of graph hypersurfaces of non - planar ribbon graphs in noncommutative field theories can have negative coefficients makes it more interesting to check the case of non - planar graphs in the ordinary case as well .",
    "it is well known that , for an ordinary graph to be non - planar , it has to contain a copy of either the complete graph @xmath565 on five vertices or the complete bipartite graph @xmath566 on six vertices .",
    "either one of these graphs corresponds to a graph polynomial that is currently beyond the reach of the available macaulay2 routine and a theoretical argument that provides a more direct approach to the computation of the corresponding csm class does not seem to be easily available .",
    "it remains an interesting question to compute these csm classes , especially in view of the fact that the original computations of @xcite of feynman integrals of graphs appear to indicate that the non - planarity of the graph is somehow related to the presence of more interesting periods ( _ e.g. _  multiple as opposed to simple zeta values ) .",
