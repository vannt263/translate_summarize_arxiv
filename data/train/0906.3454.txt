    "in many applications of quantum information processing that employ radiation fields , it is often desirable that the fields possess nonclassical nature such as entanglement and squeezing . from a theoretical point of view , perhaps the simplest way of generating nonclassical field states is to apply the photon creation operation @xmath0 to classical states such as the thermal and coherent states @xcite .",
    "these nonclassical field states , referred to as the single - photon added coherent state @xcite and the single - photon added thermal state @xcite , respectively , have been realized experimentally @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate nonclassical properties of the field states that result when the photon annihilation - then - creation operation ( ac ) @xmath1 and the photon creation - then - annihilation operation ( ca ) @xmath2 are applied to the thermal and coherent states .",
    "the noncommutativity of the photon operations , @xmath3=1 $ ] , breaks the symmetry between ac and ca .",
    "it thus is of interest to analyze and compare the properties of the states that result after ac and ca .",
    "in fact , a direct observation of the noncommutativity of the operators @xmath4 and @xmath0 has been achieved by experimentally comparing such two states and proving that they differ from each other @xcite . an experimental scheme to directly prove the commutation relation @xmath3=1",
    "$ ] has also been proposed recently @xcite . here",
    "we look in particular at the possibility and the degree of nonclassicality exhibited by the states produced by ac and ca .",
    "we also investigate properties of the states obtained when ac and ca are applied repeatedly to the thermal and coherent states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the effect of the photon creation and annihilation operations @xmath0 and @xmath4 . in sec .",
    "iii we study properties of the states produced by ac and ca operated on the thermal state and the coherent state .",
    "we also study the effect of repeated applications of ac and ca to the thermal and coherent states . experimental schemes to realize ac and ca with a cavity system are described in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v presents a discussion of our results .",
    "the creation ( annihilation ) operator @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) acting on a photon number state @xmath5 results in an increase ( a decrease ) of the photon number by one .",
    "as the creation ( annihilation ) operator is not a hermitian , however , it can not be expected to always play the role of physically adding ( subtracting ) one photon .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary pure field state @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "the state that results after application of the operator @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) to the state @xmath8 is @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 signifies that normalization is to be performed on the unnormalized state inside the curly bracket .",
    "one easily finds @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 refer to the mean photon number of the state @xmath8 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and @xmath18 is the photon - number variance of the state @xmath8 @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) indicate that , only when the state @xmath8 has zero photon - number variance , the creation ( annihilation ) operation increases ( decreases ) the mean photon number by one . the mean photon number increases at least by one under the action of the creation operator and decreases at most by one under the action of the annihilation operator .",
    "in fact , the mean photon number can even increase upon application of the annihilation operator , which occurs when @xmath20 .",
    "this tendency of the mean photon number to increase beyond one s naive expectation has its origin in the relation @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; a large photon number carries a greater weight in the state obtained after the @xmath0 or @xmath4 operation than in the original state .",
    "the operations @xmath0 and @xmath4 can have more profound effects upon the state they are applied to than simply changing the number of photons .",
    "in fact , the states that result after the operation @xmath0 and @xmath4 often exhibit significantly different physical properties from the original state and from each other . it is well known that a creation operation on thermal and coherent states yields nonclassical states , while the states remain classical upon an annihilation operation .",
    "in this section we consider the effect of the annihilation - then - creation operation ( ac ) @xmath1 and the creation - then - annihilation operation ( ca ) @xmath2 on thermal and coherent states .",
    "we further study the properties of the states that are obtained when ac and ca , respectively , are applied repeatedly .",
    "we look in particular at the possibility and the degree of nonclassicality exhibited by these states .",
    "the thermal state is characterized by the density matrix @xmath23 .",
    "the mean photon number @xmath24 and the photon - number variance @xmath25 for the state ( 3 ) are given respectively by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , yielding the mandel q factor @xcite @xmath28 .",
    "application of the operation ac and ca , respectively , to the state ( 3 ) yields @xmath29 the mandel q factor for the states ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) can be obtained through straightforward calculations .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the calculated q factor as a function of @xmath30 , the mean photon number of the initial thermal state ( 3 ) .",
    "it can be seen that , when the ac operation is applied to the thermal state , the q factor becomes negative and thus the photon number distribution becomes sub - poissonian for a sufficiently small initial mean photon number , i.e. , for @xmath31 .",
    "the sub - poissonian photon statistics implies nonclassical properties of the state , although the reverse is not necessarily true . under the ca operation , however , the photon statistics remains super - poissonian regardless of @xmath30 .",
    "the figure indicates also that the difference in the mandel q factor between the two states @xmath32 and @xmath33 is more significant when @xmath30 is smaller .",
    "the difference in the degree of nonclassicality between the two states ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , in which the corresponding wigner distribution functions @xcite are plotted for the case @xmath34 . only the wigner distribution for the state ( 4 ) takes on negative values in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "we now consider the states produced by repeated applications of @xmath1 or @xmath2 to the initial thermal state ( 3 ) . a straightforward algebra yields @xmath35 where @xmath36 can be any positive integer and @xmath37 is the polylogarithm .",
    "the mean photon number ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and the variance ( @xmath40^k_{ac}$ ] and @xmath41^k_{ca}$ ] ) for the states ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , can also be obtained by straightforward calculations .",
    "we obtain @xmath42 @xmath43^k_{ac } & = & [ ( \\delta \\hat{n})^2]^k_{ca}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{li_{-2k-2}(\\frac{\\overline{n}}{1+\\overline{n } } ) } { li_{-2k}(\\frac{\\overline{n}}{1+\\overline{n}})}-(\\frac{li_{-2k-1}(\\frac{\\overline{n}}{1+\\overline{n } } ) } { li_{-2k}(\\frac{\\overline{n}}{1+\\overline{n}})})^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thus see that the mean photon number of state ( 6 ) is always larger by exactly one than that of state ( 7 ) ( note , on the other hand , the operator identity @xmath44 ) regardless of @xmath36 .",
    "we also see that the photon number variance is exactly the same for the two states ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , regardless of @xmath36 .    in general , as the number @xmath36 of operations @xmath1 or @xmath2",
    "is increased from @xmath45 , the mean photon number of the state increases rapidly .",
    "this is due to the fact already mentioned in sec .",
    "ii that a larger photon number carries a greater weight in the state after the @xmath0 or @xmath4 operation than in the original state .",
    "it then is clear from eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) that , for large @xmath36 , the two states @xmath46 and @xmath47 possess almost identical photon - number statistics . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the mandel q factor as a function of @xmath30 for the two states @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the two curves are seen to be very close to each other .",
    "close inspection reveals , however , that the curve for the state @xmath48 lies slightly below that for the state @xmath49 , indicating that the state @xmath48 shows slightly stronger nonclassicality than the state @xmath49 . for both states ,",
    "the mandel q factor is negative and the photon - number distribution is sub - poissonian if @xmath50 .",
    "that the two states @xmath51 and @xmath52 approach each other as @xmath36 moves toward a large number can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "4 , in which the fidelity between the two states , @xmath53^{1/2}\\}^2 $ ] @xcite is plotted as a function of @xmath36 , for the case @xmath34 .",
    "the coherent state @xmath54 has a poissonian photon - number distribution , and thus @xmath55 for the coherent state . upon application of ac and ca ,",
    "respectively , the coherent state @xmath54 is transformed to the states @xmath56 it should be mentioned that , since the coherent state is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath4 , @xmath57 is given simply by @xmath58 and can be identified as the single - photon added coherent state .",
    "5 shows the mandel q factor for the states ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) as a function of @xmath59 , the mean photon number of the initial coherent state .",
    "it is seen that both states ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) have negative q values regardless of @xmath59 . as before for the case of the initial thermal state , the ac operation produces stronger nonclassicality than the ca operation , with the difference more significant when @xmath59 is smaller . in fig .",
    "6 we show the wigner distributions for the states ( 10 ) and(11 ) for the case @xmath60 .",
    "one sees that both ac and ca operations lead to negative wigner distributions , but the degree of negativity created by the ac operation is stronger .",
    "let us consider the states produced by repeated applications of ac and ca , respectively , to the coherent state , given by @xmath61 and @xmath62 as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "one sees here that both states exhibit negative q factors , but the state @xmath63 shows a slightly stronger sub - poissonian photon distribution than @xmath62 . comparing fig . 5 and fig . 7",
    ", one also sees that , as @xmath36 is increased , the two states @xmath64 and @xmath65 approach each other . in fig .",
    "8 we plot the fidelity between the two states , @xmath66 , as a function of @xmath36 , for the case @xmath60 .",
    "the fidelity approaches 1 as @xmath36 is increased .",
    "the photon creation operation @xmath0 on the coherent and thermal states was realized experimentally by zavatta et al .",
    "using an optical system based on parametric down - conversion in a nonlinear crystal followed by conditional detection of a single photon in the idler mode @xcite . the same group later achieved an experimental realization of the photon annihilation - then - creation operation ( ac ) @xmath1 and the photon creation - then - annihilation operation ( ca ) @xmath2 on the thermal state using again an optical system , which provided direct observation of the noncommutativity of the operators @xmath0 and @xmath4 @xcite . here",
    "we briefly desribe an experimental scheme to realize ac and ca using a cavity system along the line suggested by sun et al .",
    "@xcite .    in order to realize ac , we pass two atoms , atom 1 prepared in the lower state @xmath67 and atom 2 in the upper state @xmath68 , in order through a cavity .",
    "let us assume an arbitrary pure state @xmath69 for the initial cavity field .",
    "( for simplicity we assume a pure state .",
    "essentially the same analysis can be applied to obtain the same result even if the initial cavity field is in a mixed state . ) a simple algebra yields that the state of the cavity field after the interaction of the cavity with the two atoms , conditioned upon the observation that atom 1 is found in state @xmath68 and atom 2 in state @xmath67 after the interaction , is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the atom - field coupling constant , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are , respectively , the interaction time between atom 1 and the cavity and between atom 2 and the cavity .",
    "the state ( 14 ) can approximately be identified as the state latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    if the interaction times @xmath72 and @xmath73 are sufficiently short that @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath24 is the mean photon number of the initial field state @xmath77 .",
    "repeated operations of ac , @xmath78 , can then be realized by letting @xmath36 pairs of atoms , each pair prepared in @xmath67 and @xmath68 , interact with a cavity , and postselecting the case where each pair is found in @xmath68 and @xmath67 , subjected to the condition that all interaction times are sufficiently short .",
    "similarly , the operation ca can be realized by letting two atoms , atom 1 prepared in @xmath68 and atom 2 in @xmath67 , interact with a cavity field , conditioned upon atom 1 being found in @xmath67 and atom 2 in @xmath68 after the interaction and the interaction times @xmath72 and @xmath73 being sufficiently short . in this case , the state of the cavity field after the interaction is @xmath70 which , in the short time limit @xmath79 , @xmath80 , approaches the state @xmath81 , can also be realized by using @xmath36 pairs of atoms .",
    "the ac and ca operations can be realized with the cavity scheme described above with high fidelities @xmath82 and @xmath83 , if the interaction times are sufficiently short . the problem , however , is that , in the short - time limit , the success probability of the scheme is low",
    ". let @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) be the success probability of the scheme to realize ac ( ca ) , i.e. , let @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) be the probability to find atom 1 in @xmath68 ( @xmath67 ) and atom 2 in @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) after the interaction .",
    "one can easily find that @xmath86 in the short - time limit , @xmath87 . for repeated operations @xmath78 and @xmath88 , the success probabilities are extremely small in the short - time limit as @xmath89 .    instead of taking the short interaction times",
    ", one can choose @xmath72 and @xmath73 in such a way that @xmath90 for ac and @xmath91 for ca , where @xmath24 is the mean photon number of the initial cavity field .",
    "this choice ensures that the desired state transitions @xmath92 for both atoms 1 and 2 occur with high probabilities . when the atom makes a transition as desired , the cavity field gains or loses a photon as desired .",
    "one can thus hope that , with this choice of the interaction times , both the success probability and the fidelity may stay reasonably close to unity .",
    "clearly , this strategy would work well if the initial cavity field has a sharp photon - number distribution centered at @xmath24 , which is the case for the initial coherent state but not for the initial thermal state . in fig .",
    "9 we plot the success probability @xmath84 and the fidelity @xmath93 we computed as a function of @xmath59 for the case when the initial cavity field state is a coherent state , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are chosen to satisfy the relation @xmath94 .",
    "one can see clearly that both the success probability and the fidelity stay close to unity for @xmath95 .",
    "the success probability @xmath85 and the fidelity @xmath96 show similar behavior , the only significant difference being that , as @xmath97 , @xmath98 as can be seen from fig 9 but @xmath99 .",
    "the result shown in fig.9 suggests that , with this choice of the interaction times , even repeated operations of ac and ca can be realized experimentally with reasonably high success probability and fidelity , if the initial cavity field has a sufficiently sharp photon - number distribution .    to assess the feasibility of the suggested experiment",
    ", we take , as an example , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the interaction times @xmath72 and @xmath73 are then required to be @xmath102 . since photon addition and subtraction should occur within these interaction times , we require the spontaneous emission decay rate @xmath103 and the cavity field decay rate @xmath104 be small compared with @xmath105 , i.e. , we require @xmath106 and @xmath107 , an experimental condition that can be met without too much difficulty .",
    "photon annihilation - then - creation and creation - then - annihilation operations can be implemented experimentally using cavity - field atom interactions as described above as well as using optical means along the line of refs.@xcite .",
    "the cavity - qed method described here offers the flexibility of choosing interaction times in such a way that the desired states @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be generated with both high success probability and high fidelity .",
    "the noncommutativity of the photon creation and annihilation operations can thus be verified with high success probability not easily achievable in the optical approach , if the cavity - qed method is adopted .",
    "we have studied effects of the photon annihilation - then - creation operation ( ac ) @xmath1 and the photon creation - then - annihilation operation ( ca ) @xmath2 , and their repeated applications on the thermal and coherent states .",
    "the common feature of ac and ca is that they both work to increase the mean photon number unless the initial state is the number state .",
    "that this is the case can be understood by noting that , due to the relation @xmath110 and @xmath111 , a larger photon number carries a greater weight in the state obtained after the operation @xmath1 or @xmath2 is applied than in the initial state .",
    "details of exactly how the weight of each photon number is changed , however , are different for the two operations .",
    "close inspection of this difference shed light on one of the main observations of this work , namely the observation that ac in general produces stronger nonclassicality than ca .",
    "it should be noted , in particular , that the vacuum state , which is a part of the initial thermal or coherent state , disappears upon application of the @xmath1 operation , whereas it still remains after the @xmath2 operation . as a result ,",
    "the state produced by the @xmath1 operation has a significantly different photon number distribution from the initial  classical \" distribution , especially if the vacuum state has a large weight in the initial state , i.e. , if the initial thermal or coherent state has a small mean photon number .",
    "this explains why nonclassical properties are exhibited more strongly after ac than after ca and why the difference is more pronounced when the mean photon number of the initial state is small .",
    "if the operation @xmath1 or @xmath2 is applied repeatedly , the mean photon number of the state increases and accordingly the weight of the vacuum state becomes small .",
    "in such a case , the effect of the @xmath1 operation will not be much different from the effect of the @xmath2 operation .",
    "this explains why the two states produced by applying the @xmath1 operation @xmath36 times and the @xmath2 operation @xmath36 times approach each other as @xmath36 is increased .    in this work ,",
    "we have used the mandel q factor and the wigner distribution as an indicator of nonclassicality . in a recent work @xcite , nonclassicality of the field states generated by photon",
    "creation - then - annihilation operations were investigated using the nonclassical depth @xcite as a criterion for nonclassicality .",
    "we further note that our investigation here focuses on nonclassical effects related to sub - poissonian photon statistics . as photon - added thermal and coherent states",
    "have been shown to exhibit higher - order nonclassical effects beyond negativity of the mandel q factor and the wigner distribution function@xcite , the states generated by photon creation - then - annihilation operations and by photon annihilation - then - creation operations should also exhibit such higher - order nonclassical effects .",
