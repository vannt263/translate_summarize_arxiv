    "as is well known , the critical behavior of a physical system strongly depends on the range of the interactions .",
    "the longer the range , the stronger critical fluctuations will be suppressed . in the limit of infinite range",
    "we recover classical or mean - field - like critical behavior . for interactions with a finite range ,",
    "however , fluctuations remain very important and essentially modify the critical behavior . as follows from the ginzburg criterion  @xcite , sufficiently close to the critical temperature @xmath1 nonclassical critical exponents apply for any finite interaction range @xmath0 .",
    "this crucial difference between finite and infinite @xmath0 implies a crossover from one type of critical behavior to another as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "such crossover phenomena are of great interest for a wealth of critical phenomena .",
    "they occur , e.g. , in polymer mixtures ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , as a function of the chain length , and gas  liquid transitions , as a function of the difference between the temperature and the critical temperature .",
    "the explanation of these phenomena in terms of competing fixed points of a renormalization transformation is one of the important features of the renormalization theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , mon and binder have already studied crossover as a function of @xmath0 within the context of finite - size scaling , motivated by the crossover in polymer mixtures .",
    "they predicted that the critical amplitudes of scaling functions display a singular dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the various power - law dependencies were obtained from phenomenological crossover scaling arguments . in this paper , we will derive this dependence on @xmath0 from a renormalization description of the crossover from classical to nonclassical critical behavior .",
    "the first part of the renormalization trajectory is governed by the gaussian fixed point , which is unstable for @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding scaling relations have been derived by rikvold et al .",
    "@xcite . sufficiently close to criticality",
    ", the final part of the renormalization trajectory is governed by the ising fixed point .",
    "the resulting relations are in complete agreement with the predictions from ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we obtain the @xmath0 dependence of the leading corrections to scaling and derive from renormalization arguments a logarithmic factor in the shift of the critical temperature .",
    "this factor was already conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the physical mechanism leading to the singular range dependence of scaling functions is closely related to that leading to the violation of hyperscaling for @xmath3 .",
    "the latter effect is caused by a singular dependence of thermodynamic quantities on the coefficient @xmath4 of the @xmath5 term for @xmath6 in a landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian .",
    "in other words , @xmath4 is a so - called dangerous irrelevant variable ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . here , as we will see , the fact that this coefficient becomes small for large values of @xmath0 plays again an essential role , although @xmath4 is relevant for @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we present new monte carlo results for two - dimensional ising models with an extended range of interaction .",
    "a serious problem associated with such simulations is that the simulation time tends to increase rapidly with the number of interacting spins .",
    "however , a large interaction range is crucial to observe the predicted @xmath0 dependencies , as will follow from the renormalization description . the maximum range that could be accessed in ref .",
    "@xcite was too small to verify the theoretical predictions .",
    "we overcome this limitation by means of an efficient cluster monte carlo algorithm  @xcite , in which the simulation time per spin is practically independent of the range of the interactions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we derive the @xmath0 dependence of critical amplitudes from renormalization theory .",
    "these results are verified by monte carlo simulations , presented in section  [ sec : mc ] .",
    "we end with our conclusion in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "two technical issues , namely the fourier transform of a spherical distribution of interactions in a general number of dimensions and the application of the cluster algorithm to medium - range interactions , are addressed in appendices [ sec : fourier ] and  [ sec : algorithm ] , respectively .",
    "a model with long - range interactions which has attracted much attention is that in which the spin  spin interactions decay algebraically as a function of the distance @xmath7 between the spins , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 is the dimensionality and @xmath11 the interaction strength ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath2",
    ", this model displays an interesting continuous variation of critical behavior as function of @xmath12 : for @xmath13 the critical behavior is classical ( mean - field - like ) , for @xmath14 the critical exponents vary continuously , and for @xmath15 , the interactions decay fast enough to yield short - range ( ising - like ) critical behavior . here , @xmath16 denotes the exponent @xmath17 in the @xmath10-dimensional model with short - range interactions .",
    "the algebraical decay of the interactions is responsible for the existence of an intermediate regime between ising - like and classical critical behavior . in this paper",
    "we focus on a different way to interpolate between the long - range ( mean - field ) limit and short - range models . instead , we choose ferromagnetic interactions which are constant within a range @xmath0 and zero beyond this range .",
    "thus , we have the following hamiltonian @xmath18 where the spin ",
    "spin interaction @xmath19 for @xmath20 and the sums run over all spins in the system .",

    "furthermore , we restrict the wavevectors to lie within the first brillouin zone , which is reminiscent of the underlying lattice structure . the interaction term can be expanded in a taylor series containing only even terms in @xmath30 .",
    "this means that we will be mainly concerned with the term of order @xmath31 , because higher - order terms will turn out to be irrelevant . the constant term in the taylor series is absorbed in @xmath32 and the coefficient of the quadratic term as a factor in @xmath33 .",

    "* , eq .  ( 48 ) ) .",
    "the cluster algorithm we have used for the present monte carlo simulations has essentially been described in ref .",
    "however , that description is rather concise ; here , we present a somewhat more elaborate discussion of the mathematical backgrounds , and we outline how the algorithm is applied to medium - range models of the type studied in this paper .    the description is given in terms of the wolff cluster algorithm  @xcite , but the principle applies only to the cluster formation process .",
    "thus , it is also applicable in the swendsen ",
    "wang case  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we describe the way a cluster of spins is built in the case that there are only ferromagnetic interactions .    for each spin in the cluster",
    ", we have to run a task described below . during this task",
    ", new spins may be included in the cluster .",
    "for this reason , it is convenient to use a `` stack '' memory containing the addresses of the spins for which the task remains to be done .",
    "the task for a spin @xmath227 read from the stack is the following .",
    "a loop is executed over all neighbors @xmath228 interacting with @xmath227 . in each step of this loop ,",
    "the bond connecting sites @xmath229 and @xmath230 is `` activated '' with a probability @xmath231 where @xmath232 , in which @xmath163 is the coupling between @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the simulation process would conventionally include a test whether @xmath227 and @xmath228 are parallel , and if so , the production of a uniformly distributed pseudo - random number @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath233 , the bond is activated , @xmath228 is added to the cluster , and its address @xmath230 is stored in the stack memory . since this loop runs over all neighbors interacting with @xmath227 , i.e. , over all sites within a distance @xmath137 , the process becomes very time consuming when the range @xmath137 of the interactions becomes large , just as in the case of metropolis simulations .",
    "however , the cluster formation process can be formulated in a more efficient way .",
    "part of the work involved in the activation of the bonds between @xmath227 and its neighbors @xmath228 can be done in a way that does not depend on the signs of the spins .",
    "thus , as a first step , the bonds connected to @xmath227 are `` provisionally activated '' with a probability @xmath128 , independent of their relative sign .",
    "typically , only a small number of bonds will be provisionally activated for each entry @xmath229 in the stack memory ( i.e. , each spin in the cluster ) .",
    "then , in the second step , the provisionally active bonds , say between sites @xmath229 and @xmath230 , are actually activated if @xmath234 , i.e. , with probability @xmath235 . during the second step",
    ", the bonds that were left inactive in the first step can be ignored .",
    "since the first step does not depend on the signs of the spins , and the probability @xmath128 is typically quite small , we introduce ( following ref .",
    "@xcite ) a _ cumulative bond probability_. this quantity determines which bond is the _ next _ bond to be provisionally activated .",
    "the probability that , during the first step , @xmath236 bonds are left inactive and that the @xmath36th bond is provisionally activated is equal to @xmath237 the cumulative bond probability @xmath238 is defined as @xmath239 the interval @xmath236 to the next bond to be provisionally activated is obtained by drawing a random number @xmath7 ( @xmath240 ) . if this random number lies between @xmath241 and @xmath238 , @xmath236 bonds are skipped and the @xmath36th bond is provisionally activated .",
    "it is readily seen that this procedure leads to precisely the required probabilities given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bprob ] ) .",
    "but the number of operations per spin in the cluster is only of order @xmath242 ; near criticality , this quantity is approximately equal to 1 .",
    "thus , the work involved in the decision concerning the actual bond activation is also of order unity .",
    "we check independently whether the resulting probability of activating the first bond at a distance @xmath36 is equal to that in the conventional approach .",
    "consider a cluster spin , say @xmath198 , with a chain of neighbors denoted @xmath243 , of which @xmath75 spins are antiparallel to @xmath198 and @xmath244 spins are parallel to @xmath198 , among which @xmath245 . in the conventional wolff cluster algorithm , the probability that @xmath245 is the _ first _ spin to be added to the cluster is , provided that @xmath246 , given by @xmath247 on the other hand , if we use the cumulative bond probability ( [ eq : cumprob ] ) , this probability is calculated as follows . either the @xmath36th spin is selected directly ( if the first random number lies between @xmath241 and @xmath238 ) or one of the @xmath75 antiparallel spins is selected , say @xmath248 , which is of course not added to the cluster . in the latter case ,",
    "another random number is drawn and a new spin is selected .",
    "again , this may be the @xmath36th spin , or one of the remaining antiparallel spins between @xmath248 and @xmath245 .",
    "now , let us show that the sum of these probabilities of adding @xmath245 as the first spin to the cluster is equal to  ( [ eq : convtotprob ] ) .",
    "denote the number of selected , `` intermediate '' , antiparallel spins by @xmath229 .",
    "there are ( ) possibilities of selecting @xmath229 intermediate spins .",
    "the probability of selecting @xmath245 after each of these sequences of spins is @xmath249 .",
    "the total probability is the sum over all numbers of intermediate spins @xmath250 which is indeed equal to ( [ eq : convtotprob ] ) .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath251k ) $ ] . by inverting this relation ,",
    "the bond distance @xmath36 can be calculated from @xmath252 , i.e. , from the random number .",
    "this approach is highly efficient ; compared to conventional ( metropolis ) algorithms the gain is typically a factor @xmath253 .",
    "finally we remark that efficient variants of this technique can be applied to long - range o(@xmath254 ) models with @xmath132 .",
    "again , bonds are provisionally activated with a probability @xmath255 ; actual activation of a bond between spins @xmath256 and @xmath257 is done afterwards with a probability @xmath258/p$ ] if @xmath259 ( where @xmath136 defines the spin - flip direction of the cluster - formation step ) and otherwise with probability @xmath260 .",
