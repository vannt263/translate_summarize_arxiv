    "let us imagine that we possess an apparatus which performs some measurement on certain quantum mechanical system such as spin of electron .",
    "we do not know which measurement is associated with the device and we would like to find it out .    obviously , the path to follow here is to perform set of measurements on various known quantum states and then estimate the unknown measurement from the collected data .",
    "such estimation strategy belongs to the broad class of the quantum reconstruction procedures which attracted considerable attention recently .",
    "the quantum state reconstruction has been widely studied and now represents a well established technique in many branches of quantum physics ( for a review , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the estimation of the quantum mechanical processes describing input - output transformations of quantum devices has been discussed in @xcite and the problem of complete characterization of arbitrary measurement process has been recently addressed in @xcite .",
    "suppose that the apparatus can respond with @xmath0 different measurement outcomes .",
    "as is well known from the theory of quantum measurement @xcite , such device is completely characterized by @xmath0 positive operator valued measures ( povm ) @xmath1 which govern the measurement statistics , @xmath2 , \\label{plm}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 denotes density matrix of the quantum state subject to the measurement , @xmath4 denotes the probability that the apparatus would respond with outcome @xmath1 to the quantum state @xmath3 , and tr stands for the trace .",
    "the povms are positive semi - definite hermitian operators , @xmath5 which decompose the unit operator , @xmath6 the condition ( [ positivity ] ) ensures that @xmath7 and ( [ unity ] ) follows from the requirement that total probability is normalized to unity , @xmath8 .    in order to determine the povms",
    ", one should measure on different known quantum states @xmath3 and then estimate the povms @xmath1 from the acquired statistics .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the total number of detections of @xmath1 for the measurements performed on the quantum state @xmath3 .",
    "assuming that the theoretical detection probability @xmath4 ( [ plm ] ) can be replaced with relative frequency , we may write @xmath10\\equiv \\sum_{i , j=1}^n \\pi_{l , ij}\\varrho_{m , ji}=\\frac{f_{lm } } { \\sum_{l^\\prime=1}^k f_{l^\\prime m } } ,   \\label{linear}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the dimension of the hilbert space on which the operators @xmath1 act .",
    "this establishes a system of linear equations for the unknown elements of the operators @xmath12 , which may easily be solved if sufficient amount of data is available .",
    "this approach is a direct analogue of linear reconstruction algorithms devised for quantum state reconstruction .",
    "the linear inversion is simple and straightforward , but it has also one significant disadvantage . the linear procedure can not guarantee the required properties of @xmath1 , namely the conditions ( [ positivity ] ) . consequently , the linear estimation may lead to unphysical povms , predicting negative probabilities @xmath4 for certain input quantum states .",
    "to avoid such problems , one should resort to more sophisticated nonlinear reconstruction strategy .    in this paper",
    "we show that the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) estimation is suitable and can be successfully used for the calibration of the measuring apparatus .",
    "ml estimation has been recently applied to reconstruction of quantum states @xcite and quantum processes ( complete positive maps between density matrices ) @xcite .",
    "here we employ it to reconstruct an unknown _ quantum measurement _ thereby demonstrating again the remarkable versatility and usefulness of ml estimation .",
    "the generic formalism is developed in sec .",
    "ii and an illustration of our method is provided in sec .",
    "iii , where we estimate a measurement performed by stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "the estimated operators @xmath1 maximize the likelihood functional @xmath13=\\prod_{l=1}^k\\prod_{m=1}^m   \\left({\\rm tr}[\\hat{\\pi}_l\\hat{\\varrho}_m]\\right)^{f_{lm } } ,   \\label{likelihood}\\ ] ] where @xmath14^{-1 }   \\label{f}\\ ] ] is the relative frequency and @xmath15 is the number of different quantum states @xmath3 used for the reconstruction .",
    "the maximum of the likelihood functional ( [ likelihood ] ) has to be found in the sub - space of physically allowed operators @xmath1 .",
    "we can decompose each operator @xmath1 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the eigenvalues of @xmath1 and @xmath18 are corresponding orthonormal eigenstates .",
    "the maximum of @xmath19 $ ] can be found from the extremum conditions .",
    "it is convenient to work with the logarithm of the original likelihood functional and the constraint ( [ unity ] ) has to be incorporated by introducing a hermitian matrix of lagrange multipliers @xmath20 .",
    "the extremum conditions then read @xmath21=0 . \\label{extremum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we immediately find @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 let us now multiply ( [ phiiter ] ) by @xmath25 from the right and sum over @xmath26 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath27 on averaging ( [ piter ] ) and its hermitean conjugate counterpart , we get @xmath28 the matrix of lagrange multipliers @xmath29 should be determined from the constraint ( [ unity ] ) . on summing eq .",
    "( [ piter ] ) over @xmath30 , we find @xmath31 eqs .",
    "( [ piterher ] ) and ( [ lambdaiter ] ) can be conveniently solved by means of repeated iterations .    if the linear inversion based on eqs .",
    "( [ linear ] ) provides physically sensible result , then the ml estimate agrees with this linear reconstruction . to prove it explicitly ,",
    "let us assume that the set of povms @xmath1 solves the eqs .",
    "( [ linear ] ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath32 on inserting this expression into ( [ piter ] ) , we obtain @xmath33 here the prime indicates that we should sum only over those @xmath34 with nonzero @xmath35",
    ". however , this restriction may be dropped . if @xmath36 , then @xmath37 and the addition of zero to the right - hand side of ( [ proof ] ) changes nothing .",
    "thus the set of @xmath0 equations ( [ proof ] ) reduces to @xmath38 which is the formula for the operator of lagrange multipliers valid when the measured data are compatible with some set of povms .",
    "notice that @xmath29 is positive definite .",
    "the differences between linear reconstructions and ml estimation occur if the experimental data are not compatible with any physically allowed set of povms .",
    "the procedure of ml estimation may be interpreted as a synthesis of information from mutually incompatible observations .",
    "the ml can correctly handle noisy data and provides reliable estimates in cases when linear algorithms fail .",
    "notice that the operators @xmath39 contain the inversion of the matrix @xmath29 .",
    "the reconstruction is possible only on such subspace of the total hilbert space where the inversion @xmath40 exists .",
    "this restriction can easily be understood if we make use of eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "the experimental data contain only information on the hilbert subspace probed by the density matrices @xmath41 and the reconstruction of the povms must be restricted to this subspace .",
    "one could complain that it is not certain that the positive definiteness of povms @xmath1 is preserved during iterations based on eqs .",
    "( [ piterher ] ) and ( [ lambdaiter ] ) .",
    "we can , however , avoid such complaints by devising an iterative algorithm which exactly satisfies the constraints ( [ positivity ] ) and ( [ unity ] ) at each iteration step .",
    "we observe that we can formally decompose the povms as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is some chosen orthonormal basis , @xmath45 .    from the equations ( [ phiiter ] ) we can derive @xmath46 the constraint ( [ unity ] ) provides formula for the operator of lagrange multipliers , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is positive operator @xmath49 upon solving ( [ lambdam ] ) we get @xmath50 .",
    "we fix the branch of the square root of @xmath48 by requiring that @xmath29 should be positive definite operator .",
    "we can factorize the matrix @xmath48 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is unitary matrix and @xmath53 is diagonal matrix containing eigenvalues of @xmath48 .",
    "we define @xmath54 and we can write @xmath55    the advantage of the iterative procedure based on ( [ citer ] ) and ( [ lambdasqrt ] ) is that both conditions ( [ positivity ] ) and ( [ unity ] ) are exactly fulfilled at each iteration step .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is the greater numerical complexity in comparison to iterations based on ( [ piter ] ) and ( [ lambdaiter ] ) , because we must calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath48 at each iteration step .",
    "the determination of the quantum measurement can simplify considerably if we have some _ a - priori _ information about the apparatus .",
    "for example , if we know that we deal with a photodetector , then we have to estimate only a single parameter , the absolute photodetection effeciency @xmath56 @xcite . here",
    "we briefly consider a broader class of phase - insensitive detectors which are sensitive only to the number of photons in a single mode of electromagnetic field .",
    "the povms describing phase - insensitive detector are all diagonal in the fock basis , @xmath57 and the ml estimation reduces to the determination of the eigenvalues @xmath58 .",
    "the extremum eqs .",
    "( [ piterher ] ) and ( [ lambdaiter ] ) simplify to @xmath59    instead of solving the extremum equations , one may directly search for the maximum of @xmath19 $ ] with the help of downhill - simplex algorithm @xcite . to implement this algorithm successfully , it is necessary to use a minimal parametrization .",
    "if we deal with @xmath11 level system , then each @xmath1 is parametrized by @xmath60 real numbers .",
    "since the constraint ( [ unity ] ) allows us to determine one povm in terms of remaining @xmath61 ones , the number of independent real parameters reads @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore we may take advantage of the cholesky decomposition , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is lower triangular matrix with real elements on its main diagonal .",
    "the parametrization ( [ cholesky ] ) is used for the first @xmath61 operators , and the last one is calculated form ( [ unity ] ) , @xmath65 thus achieving minimal parametrization . for each parameter set , where @xmath19 $ ] is evaluated , one has to check whether ( [ pk ] ) is positive semi - definite .",
    "if this does not hold , then one sets @xmath19=0 $ ] , thus restricting the numerical search of the maximum to the domain of physically allowed operators .",
    "this domain is a finite volume subspace of a @xmath62 dimensional space .",
    "in this section we illustrate the developed formalism by means of numerical simulations for stern - gerlach apparatus measuring a spin-@xmath66 particle . we choose the three eigenstates of the operator of @xmath67-component of the spin as the basis states , @xmath68 , @xmath69 . in this basis , the matrix representation of the spin operators reads @xmath70 @xmath71    fig . 1 : reconstructed povms @xmath1 ( solid bars ) and the exact povms ( hollow bars )",
    ". the figure displays elements of the vectors @xmath72 defined in eq .",
    "( [ pivector ] ) . in the simulation , we made @xmath73 measurements on each of @xmath74 different quantum states , which represents altogether @xmath75 measurements .    in our numerical simulations ,",
    "we assume @xmath74 different pure quantum states : three eigenstates of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , and nine superposition states @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "the measurement on each state is performed @xmath87 times thus the total number of measurements is @xmath88 .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations of the measurement and then we have reconstructed the three povms @xmath1 characterizing given apparatus . in the simulations ,",
    "the device measures the projection of the spin along @xmath89 axis , and the true povms are projectors @xmath90 @xmath91 .",
    "the elements of the povms can be conveniently collected in a real vector @xmath92 the estimated povms as well as the true povms ( [ truepovm ] ) are plotted in fig .",
    "the estimate has been obtained by iteratively solving the extremum equations and both sets ( [ piterher ] ) , ( [ lambdaiter ] ) and ( [ citer ] ) , ( [ lambdasqrt ] ) provide identical results .",
    "the reconstructed operators are in good agreement with the exact ones . equally important",
    "is the fact that the estimated operators @xmath1 meet the constraints ( [ positivity ] ) and ( [ unity ] ) .    in summary , we have shown how to reconstruct a generic quantum measurement with the use of maximum - likelihood principle .",
    "our method guarantees that the estimated povms , which fully describe the measuring apparatus , meet all the required positivity and completness constraints .",
