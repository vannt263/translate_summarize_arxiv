    "supernovae are known to be explosions of massive and intermediate mass stars , although the nature of the progenitor star for different supernova types , remains an area of long - standing research .",
    "currently , it is believed that type ii and type ib or ic supernovae arise from core collapse of massive stars , while the more homogeneous type ia supernovae are the results of thermonuclear explosions .",
    "there is a considerable variety among the core collapse supernovae spectroscopically and in their kinetic energy .",
    "the ` hypernova ' class among these are believed to have explosion energy significantly in excess of @xmath1 , found in `` normal '' supernovae .",
    "the spatial and temporal near - coincidence of type ic sn 1998bw with the long duration grb980425 has provided further impetus to observational and theoretical studies of type ib / ic sne and their progenitors ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    during a supernova explosion",
    "the interaction of the outer parts of the stellar ejecta with the circumstellar matter gives rise to a high energy density shell .",
    "x - ray emission is expected from both shocked circumstellar matter and the shocked supernova matter ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the interaction region may also accelerate electrons to relativistic energies and amplify pre - existing magnetic fields which gives rise to nonthermal synchrotron emission seen in many supernovae .",
    "the radio and the x - ray emission give information on a region of the supernova which may be far removed from the optical photosphere ( which has a smaller radius ) , although the conditions in the optical photosphere may determine the x - ray emission characteristics in some instances .",
    "in general , x - ray and radio observations in early stages of a supernova can be used to determine ( 1 ) the total mass lost from the pre - supernova star before explosion and ( 2 ) constrain various physical processes leading to x - ray and radio emission .",
    "the type ic sn 2002ap was discovered on jan .",
    "29.4 , 2002 ( y. hirose as reported by @xcite ) in ngc 628 ( m74 ) , at a distance of only @xmath2 mpc . based on spectral analysis of the early observations ,",

    "we also compare sn 2002ap with 2 other sne ( 1998bw ( ic ) and 1993j ( iib ) for which early multi frequency data is available . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : radiative ] we discuss these results in the context of the presupernova star and its evolution .",
    "sn 2002ap and its host galaxy m74 ( ngc 628 ) were observed by xmm - newton , four days after the discovery of the sn . @xcite and @xcite have reported the epic - pn detection of the supernova , as well as several other sources in the host galaxy . here",
    "we present a spectral analysis of the xmm - newton epic - pn and -mos ccd detection , taking into account contributions from other pre - existing sources present in the extraction circle , near the supernova .",
    "xmm - newton observed the field of view of sn 2002ap in the full - frame , thin filter mode , for the epic - pn and the two epic - mos cameras .",
    "simultaneously , it also observed m74 with the optical monitor in the uvw1 .",
    "the full exposure in the epic ccds was @xmath6 ks between feb 3.00 to 3.40 , 2002 ut .",
    "since chandra x - ray observatory also observed the same field on june 19 , 2001 and october 19 , 2001 for a total of 47 ks , we present our analysis , based on both the presupernova and post - supernova exposures .",
    "early analysis of the xmm - too observations of sn 2002ap showed that the supernova is rather faint in x - rays with a flux of @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 . because the psf of the xmm epic - ccds is rather large ( @xmath10 to enclose 90% of the energy at 10 kev ) , it was necessary to verify the absence of , or to account for the presence of any other sources , however faint , within the spectral extraction region on the epic ccds .      in order to check if there were any other sources present in the vicinity of the optical position of sn 2002ap ( ra @xmath11 , dec = @xmath12 ) , we examined the archival chandra observations of m74 , carried out on 19th oct .",

    "however , we did find a bright source at ra @xmath13 and dec @xmath14 , which , being only 14.9 away from the sne , was well within the region of xmm spectral extraction .",
    "comparing the positions of bright , point - like sources seen in both the chandra and xmm fields of view , we found that the relative astrometric shift between chandra and xmm is at most @xmath15 .",
    "thus , this object ( hereafter , cxu j013623.4 + 154459 ) would have been detected within the 40circle used to extract the xmm - epic spectra .",
    "level-2 pipeline processed chandra data was used for spectral analysis , since a check on the calibration files used in the archived level-2 processed data showed that no improvement would be made by re - calibrating the data .",
    "the spectrum was extracted using the ciao software , and the spectral analysis was carried out using the sherpa software .",
    "the source was located on acis - s6 chip , and a light curve was extracted from a source free region of the acis - s6 chip to check that the observation was not contaminated by background flares .",
    "we also extracted a light curve for the source , to check for flaring , or any periodic variation , but the object is too faint for any such variability to be noted . since no sources are seen within @xmath16 of this object , we used a region of radius @xmath17 to extract the spectrum . as a measure of the psf at the source location ,",
    "a radial region of @xmath18 would enclose 50% of the energy at 1.49 kev .",
    "cxu j013623.4 + 154459 is very faint , and the higher energy ( @xmath19 kev ) spectrum is seen to be strongly dominated by the background  possibly due to high energy particles , rather than x - ray events .",
    "because of the problems associated with accurately modeling the high energy component of the background spectra , we used background subtracted data and restricted our analysis to the energy range @xmath20 kev .",
    "the background subtracted count rate in this energy band is @xmath21 s@xmath9 . fixing the column density at @xmath22 @xmath23 , ( obtained from online hydrogen column density generator of high energy astrophysics archive ( heasarc ) , in the direction of the sn ) and using the @xmath24-gehrels statistic , we found that the source was well fitted by a power - law spectrum with a photon index @xmath25 , implying a 0.3 - 10.0 kev flux of @xmath26 ergs @xmath8 s@xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath24 goodness - of - fit parameter was @xmath27 , where @xmath28 measures the probability of obtaining the observed ( or larger ) value of @xmath24 , if the data was well represented by the fitted parameters .",

    "sn 2002ap was observed by the xmm instruments from feb .",
    "2.03 to feb .",
    "2.42 ut , 2002 ( estimated 5 days after the explosion ) , for a duration of 37.4 ksec . both epic - mos and epic - pn observations were carried out in the thin1 filter mode .",

    "filtering out these intervals of highly fluctuating background reduced the exposure time to 25.5 ks in epic - pn and @xmath31 ks in each of epic - mos1 and mos2 .",
    "sn 2002ap was identified on the epic - ccds using the optical coordinates ( ra @xmath11 , dec @xmath32 ) .",
    "the epic - pn spectra was extracted using a circle of radius @xmath33 , within which almost 80% of the source photons in the energy range",
    "@xmath34 kev would be enclosed , with the extraction region remaining on a single ccd chip .",

    "we compare the radio data obtained from three different supernovae in their early phases and model these using the synchrotron self absorption model .",
    "sn 1998bw(ic ) with a grb counterpart had very different radiosphere radius and equipartition angular sizes at approximately the same time in their evolution compared to two other sne : sn 2002ap(ic ) and sn 1993j(iib ) .",
    "we model the early x - ray emission with inputs from optical photometry and light curve and find that the inverse compton scattering of optical photons from the supernova photosphere by hot electron plasma can account for the observed early x - ray flux and the spectrum for modest electron temperatures and optical depths .",
    "thermal processes are inefficient initially and would be important only as the supernova ages .",
    "mass loss rates and stellar wind velocities of the progenitor stars determine the optical depth of shock heated matter due to electron scattering ,  a key parameter in the production of the x - ray flux from the lower energy photons .",
    "these in turn depend upon the scenario and progenitor configuration giving rise to type ic sne , e.g. : 1 .",
    "massive wolf - rayet(wr ) stars which have lost their hydrogen and helium envelope before the explosion ( @xcite ) have an empirically determined mass loss rate of @xmath48 ( after taking into account effects due to clumpy medium , ( @xcite , @xcite ) and terminal wind velocities @xmath49 km s@xmath9 depending upon the type of the wr star .",
    "2 . interacting binaries - in particular , in a case bb mass transfer from a helium star overflowing its roche - lobe to a companion removes most of the helium rich layers before the type ic sn .",
    "habets ( 1985 ) finds that a 2.5 @xmath50 helium star during carbon shell burning stage expands to a red giant dimension of 18 @xmath51 and sustains an average mass transfer rate of @xmath52 lasting about 3000 years . during this time , the terminal wind speed , of the mass losing star would be typically @xmath53 km s@xmath9 . using the relevant parameters in the above two scenarios , we derive electron optical depth encountered by the intermediate energy photons as listed in the table [ tab : progenitor ] .",
    "it is evident that both ranges of electron optical depths for the compton boosting process remain viable alternatives . for the case of the interacting binary model where the optical depths are somewhat larger , the implied electron temperatures required for the plasma would be lower than in the single star wr model .",
    "such temperatures are well within the range expected for hot circumstellar gas ( @xmath54 ) even for modest velocities of @xmath55 km s@xmath9 for the hot electron plasma moving above the optical photosphere .",
