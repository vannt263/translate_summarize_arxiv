    "the x - ray dust scattering halo was first discussed by overbeck in 1965 . from then on , many authors developed the theory of scattering .",
    "however , there was no direct evidence for this phenomenon until 1980s when rolf ( 1983 ) first observed the x - ray halo by analyzing the data of gx339 - 4 with the imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) instrument onboard the _ einstein x - ray observatory_. there are two groups of methods to study the x - ray scattering halo .",
    "the first is evaluating the halo surface brightness distribution around the point source . during the past quarter century",
    ", x - ray halos can be found in the data of _ einstein _ , _ rosat , xmm - newton , chandra _ and _ swift_. predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) analyzed the data of _ rosat _ and found a strong correlation between the visual extinction and the hydrogen column density of 25 point sources .",
    "vaughan et al . ( 2004 , 2006 ) found ring structures in two gamma - ray burst ( grb ) observations with _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift_. smith , edgar & shafer ( 2002 ) reported the halo of gx 13 + 1 between 50@xmath4 and 600@xmath4 with the data of advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) onboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. yao et al .",

    "xiang , zhang & yao ( 2005 ) reconstructed the halo s surface brightness of 17 bright sources and deduced the dust distribution along the line of sight ( los ) with the data from acis - s array .    the other way is to study the effect of delay and broadening of the light curve .",
    "tr@xmath5mper & sch@xmath6nfelder ( 1973 ) first proposed to use the delay and smearing property to determine the distances of the x - ray sources .",
    "predehl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) first used the delay property in determining the distance of cyg x-3 with the data of acis .",

    "vaughan et al . ( 2004 , 2006 ) evaluated the distances of some dust molecular clouds by the delayed ring structures in two grb observations with _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift_. thompson & rothschild ( 2008 ) used the eclipse data determining the distance of cen x-3 to be 5.7 @xmath7 1.5 kpc . ling et al .",
    "( 2009 ) first used the cross - correlation method to study the light curves of the x - ray halo of cyg x-1 .",
    "they found obvious time lag peaks in the cross - correlation curves .",
    "all those peaks revealed a dust concentration at a distance of 1.76 kpc from us .",
    "actually , the first method uses the halo surface brightness distribution to study the dust distribution and dust model , whereas the second method studies the dust distribution and source distance .",
    "the goals from each type of study are usually different .",
    "both techniques require careful point - spread function ( psf ) subtraction during the analysis .    in this work",
    ", we re - analyze the data of cyg x-3 with the cross - correlation method described in section 2 .",
    "we discuss the multiple scatterings in section 4 . after obtaining the cross - correlation curves from 15@xmath4 to 80@xmath8 ,",
    "we use two dust distributions to explain the time lags . assuming the distance as 1.7 kpc for cyg ob2 and another uniform dust distribution , we get a distance of @xmath0 kpc ( 68@xmath1 confidence level ) for cyg x-3 in section 5 .",
    "when using the distance estimation of cyg ob2 as 1.38 or 1.82 kpc , the inferred distance for cyg x-3 is @xmath2 or @xmath3 kpc respectively .",
    "we summarize our results in section 6 .",
    "the details of x - ray dust scattering can be found in van de hulst ( 1957 ) , overbeck ( 1965 ) , tr@xmath5mper & sch@xmath6nfelder ( 1973 ) , and smith & dwek ( 1998 ) . here",
    ", we just show some equations used in this work .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , an x - ray source is located at a distance of @xmath9 .",
    "the dimensionless number @xmath10 is the ratio of the distance of scattering and that of the source from us .",
    "so the lag time of scattered photons at @xmath10 can be expressed as    @xmath11    let @xmath12 denote the observed flux of the source at @xmath13 , the observed halo intensity at different observational angle @xmath14 is given by    @xmath15    where the scattering cross section @xmath16 depends on the energy of the x - ray photon and the radius of the dust grain .",
    "@xmath17 is the density ( in units of @xmath18 ) of the dust grain at @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath12 equals to a delta function , equation 2 would evolve to be a response function of a delta function ( we denote this function by @xmath19 hereafter ) .",
    "this is the situation of a grb , hence equation 2 would be an ideal observed light curve of a halo at a given observational angle @xmath20 . for the other situations , the light curve of the halo at angle @xmath14 equals to the convolution of @xmath12 and @xmath19 .",
    "this process can also be understood by figure 1 .",
    "the light curve of the halo at observational angle @xmath14 is an integral effect of scattering from the dust near the observer to the source . from this process",
    ", the light curve of the halo would be lagged and smeared from the light curve of the source .",
    "we can study the delay property directly with the cross - correlation method ( ling et al .",
    "the definition of cross - correlation coefficient is given by @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the light curves of the x - ray source and halo ( at a given observational angle @xmath14 ) in the same energy band . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the average values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    ".observations of cyg x-3 we used . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "before the analysis of the data of table 2 , we estimate the influence of the multiple scatterings . because of its high hydrogen column density , the multiple - scattered photons may contaminate the observed light curve of the halo .",
    "the details of multiple scatterings can be found in mathis @xmath26 lee ( 1991 ) .",
    "the conclusion in their study was that the single scattering dominates at small angles ( @xmath27 for @xmath28 at _ e _ = 1 kev ) .",
    "a monte carlo simulation is conducted to estimate the effect of multiple scatterings .",
    "the parameters we used are @xmath29 at _ e _ = 1 kev and _ a _ = 0.1 @xmath30 m .",
    "the simulated fractions of multiple - scattered photons to the total halo photons are shown in figure [ fig : multi ] .",
    "the solid line shows the fraction of multiple - scattered photons for band i ( below 3 kev ) .",
    "the dotted line shows the fraction of multiple - scattered photons for band ii ( 3 - 5 kev ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the fraction of multiple - scattered photons for band iii ( above 5 kev ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : multi ] , in band i the fraction of multiple - scattered photons is 8@xmath1 , 13@xmath1 , and 15@xmath1 at observational angles of 30@xmath4 , 60@xmath4 , and 80@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "compared with the uncertainties for the lag times derived in table 2 , the influence of multiple - scattered photons can be ignored in our analysis .",
    "predehl et al . ( 2000 ) analyzed the data of cyg x-3 previously .",
    "they compared the light curve of the halo within about 10@xmath8 and the light curve of the point source .",
    "they found a lag of about 2 ks in the light curve directly . assuming a uniform dust distribution",
    ", they got a distance of @xmath31 kpc for cyg x-3 . in our study , three observations are used to determine the lag time up to 75@xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : fit ] shows the result of lag time at each observational angle . from our result ,",
    "the time lags of 60@xmath4 - 75@xmath4 show significant increase compared to the other time lags .",
    "first , we try to fit the data with the same model described by predehl et al .",
    "a uniform dust distribution is used to produce an @xmath32 . by convoluting the @xmath32 with an ideal sinusoidal wave ,",
    "we get a simulated light curve of halo at observational angle @xmath14 .",
    "the dust model we used here is proposed by mathis , rumpl & nordsiech 1977 ( mrn hereafter ) .",
    "we show the process and the result in figure [ fig : convection ] .",
    "the top panel shows a sinusoidal wave , representing the light curve of the source .",
    "the middle panel shows three curves of @xmath32 in logarithm scale .",
    "the solid line shows the @xmath32 with the parameter of @xmath33 kpc and @xmath3415@xmath4 , the dotted line shows the @xmath32 of @xmath35 kpc and @xmath14 = 15@xmath4 , and the dashed line shows the @xmath36 of @xmath37 kpc and @xmath38@xmath4 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the result of convolution of the sinusoidal wave with these three different @xmath32 .",
    "these three curves are treated as the light curves of halo at different angles .",
    "the vertical axis of the bottom panel is normalized to unity for clarity .",
    "the three simulated light curves of the halo show different magnitude but have the same lag time .",
    "this result shows that if the distance of the source exceeds 2 kpc , the time lag between the light curve of the halo and that of the source will be a constant : around 3.5 ks ( less than @xmath39/4 of the sinusoidal wave ) .",
    "this is also the situation for any angle larger than 15@xmath4 .",
    "the main reason is that the profile of @xmath32 is much longer than the period of the sinusoidal wave .      from the discussion of cyg x-1 ( ling et al .",
    "2009 ) , we found that the dust distribution is quite nonuniform toward cyg x-1 : a dust concentration at a distance of 2.0 kpc @xmath40 ( 0.876 @xmath7 0.002 ) from the earth is found .",
    "thus , we try to find some dust cloud around the region of cyg x-3 to explain the time lag of 65@xmath8 and the greater than 65@xmath4 .",
    "a likely candidate for the dust concentration is the cyg ob2 association .",
    "cyg ob2 is one of the richest ob associations in the local galaxy ; it houses many of the hottest and most luminous stars known in our galaxy .",
    "cyg x-3 lies in the field of cyg ob2 ( kn@xmath6dlseder 2003 ) .",
    "hutchings ( 1981 ) assumed an absolute distance modulus ( m@xmath41 m ) = 10.7 , converting to @xmath42 = 1.38 kpc .",
    "humphreys ( 1978 ) adopted @xmath43 = 1.82 kpc , while torres - dodgen et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and massey & thompson ( 1991 ) determined @xmath43 = 1.74 kpc ( ( m - m ) = 11.2 ) .",
    "kn@xmath6dlseder ( 2000 ) assumed a distance @xmath44 1.7 kpc . in this work ,",
    "a distance of 1.7 kpc for cyg ob2 is used in the following analysis .    assuming the distance of cyg x-3 to be 10 kpc , the time lag of 65@xmath4 reveals that a dust concentration exists at a distance of about 2 kpc .",
    "this result is consistent with the distance of cyg ob2 . then taking the distance of cyg ob2 to be 1.7 kpc",
    ", we use a single dust wall model to fit the observed time lag .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : fit ] , in which the dashed line shows the shows a model assuming a dust wall 1.7 kpc from the sun and a distance of 5 kpc to the source .",
    "the dotted line shows the same model with a distance of 10 kpc to the source .",
    "those two curves can not fit the observed lags .      combining the results of section 5.1 and 5.2",
    ", we propose to use two components to fit the observed time lags .",
    "we divide the observed time lags into two parts : below 60@xmath4 and above 65@xmath4 .",
    "the first part mainly comes from the component of a uniform dust distribution and the second part is mostly due to a dust concentration of cyg ob2 at the distance of around 1.7 kpc , reflecting that the small angle halo tends to explore the dust near the source ( mathis @xmath26 lee 1991 ) .",
    "the new two - components dust distribution model needs two parameters to fit the observed time lags .",
    "the first parameter is the distance @xmath45 of the point source and the other parameter is the fraction of the dust concentrated in cyg ob2 .",
    "the solid line of figure [ fig : fit ] shows the best - fitting result . from this result",
    ", we get a distance of @xmath0 kpc ( 68@xmath1 confidence level ) of cyg x-3 .",
    "the fraction of dust concentrated in cyg ob2 is @xmath46 ( 68@xmath1 confidence level ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the distance is calculated by @xmath47 ( avni 1976 ) . at the same time",
    ", we refit the data with the distance assumption of cyg ob2 to be 1.38 and 1.82 kpc away from us .",
    "the fitting results are @xmath2 and @xmath3 kpc , respectively .    alternatively , a new way is proposed to give a range for the distance of cyg x-3 .",
    "we define the response function of a uniform dust distribution with @xmath48 , and the response function of the dust wall with @xmath49 for simplicity .",
    "then , the light curve of the halo is given by    @xmath50    here @xmath51 stands for convolution .",
    "equation 4 can be decomposed to @xmath52    equation 5 can be understood as the light curve of the halo being the sum of the two components from the two dust distributions .",
    "we use @xmath53 and @xmath54 hereafter to identify those two components . as pointed out in section 5.1 ,",
    "the @xmath53 may cause a lag of about 3.5 ks ( of course it must also have a period of @xmath39 , the same as the @xmath55 ) .",
    "the time lag of the @xmath54 depends on the distance of cyg x-3 , but obviously @xmath54 has a period of @xmath39 too .",
    "as a result , the phase of @xmath56 is related to these two components : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sum ] , the top panel represents the light curve of @xmath57 , the middle panel represents the light curve of @xmath58 .",
    "the left part of the middle panel has a lag of less than @xmath59 with respect to the top panel , and the right part has a lag of larger than @xmath59 with respect to the top panel .",
    "the bottom panel shows the sum of the above two panels .",
    "the arrows show the lag of the summed curves .",
    "the sum of those two components can cause two possible results : if @xmath60 then @xmath61    alternatively if @xmath62 then @xmath63    the first situation means that when the lag time of @xmath54 is less than the time lag of @xmath53 plus @xmath39/2 , i.e. , about 12 ks , the time lag of @xmath56 will be between 3.5 and 12 ks .",
    "the second case means that if the time lag of @xmath54 is between 12 and 20.5 ks , the time lag of the summed curve will be greater than the time lag of @xmath54 . in other words , the second situation means that the observed time lag of the halo could be longer than the time lag caused by the dust wall .",
    "let us apply these results to the observed time lags of figure [ fig : fit ] .",
    "the time lag at 65@xmath4 is around 10 ks , less than 12 ks .",
    "therefore , the time lag of @xmath54 must be less than 12 ks , as we illustrated in figure [ fig : distance ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : distance ] , the solid line is the lag time at 60@xmath4 , the dotted line is the lag time at 65@xmath8 , the dashed line is the lag time at 70@xmath4 , and the dashed dotted line is the lag time at 75@xmath4 . with the constraint of 12 ks , the distance of the source must be greater than 4.5 and 6 kpc by the data of 60@xmath4 and 65@xmath4 .",
    "the maximum of the distance can be derived by the data of 70@xmath4 , of which the time lag of the dust wall must exceed 20.5 ks ; a distance upper limit of 10 kpc is derived at this angle .",
    "the time lag of 75@xmath8 would give an upper limit of 15 kpc .",
    "using all these result , we give a range of [ 6 , 10 ] kpc for cyg x-3 .",
    "the best - fit result of @xmath0 kpc is among this range obviously .",
    "after obtaining the ratio between the two dust components , we can predict a halo surface brightness distribution with a dust grain model . we find that the halo surface brightness distribution predicted by the mrn dust model and the two - components dust distribution can not fit the observed halo surface brightness derived in xiang , zhang & yao ( 2005 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : surface ] , the dotted line shows the predicted surface brightness of a uniform distribution , and the dashed line shows the predicted surface brightness caused by cyg ob2 . the total @xmath64 used here is @xmath65 @xmath66 ( the @xmath64 derived by predehl and schmitt ( 1995 ) is @xmath67 @xmath66 ) , and the fraction of the dust in cygnus ob2 is 7@xmath1 ; clearly the dust wall has almost no influence on the halo surface brightness .",
    "the predicted halo surface brightness of source can not fit the observed surface brightness of cyg x-3 obviously .",
    "similar discrepancy has been found in our previous work on cyg x-1 ( ling et al .",
    "2009 ) . to fit the halo surface brightness of angles smaller than 10@xmath4 , we add a new dust component between _ x _ = 0.99 and _ x _ = 1.0 .",
    "the fitting result is shown by the solid line in figure [ fig : surface ] . the column density @xmath64 of the uniform distribution ,",
    "the dust wall and the dust near the source are 7.0 @xmath7 0.3 @xmath68 @xmath66 , 32.0 @xmath7 1.7 @xmath68 @xmath66 and 3.04 @xmath7 0.06 @xmath68 @xmath66 respectively .",
    "the total @xmath64 from the fitting is consistent with the result of predehl and schmitt ( 1995 ) .",
    "our fitting shows that the ratio of @xmath69 in the dust wall to the @xmath69 of the uniform dust distribution is 4.6 , conflicting significantly from our result of 0.075 derived with the cross - correlation method which is almost independent of the dust size distribution model . as a result",
    ", we conclude that the mrn dust model must be modified before it is used in the x - ray regime .      in section 5.4 ,",
    "we have shown that the mrn model is not sufficient in modeling the halo surface brightness distribution along the los of cyg x-3 . however , in the analysis of section 5.1 , the mrn dust grain model was used to produce @xmath70 , the response function of a uniform dust distribution . here",
    ", we address the question whether our result is dependent of the dust grain model . from equation 2",
    ", we can get @xmath70 with different dust radii directly .",
    "then , we could get a simulated @xmath53 for any dust radius . after comparing the phase of the light curve of source and @xmath53",
    ", we get the lag time in different dust radii .",
    "figure [ fig : dustmodel ] shows the lag time of @xmath53 of 15@xmath4 versus the distance of the source .",
    "the solid line represents the lag time of @xmath53 with a dust radius of 0.005 @xmath30 m , the dashed line represents the lag time of @xmath53 with a dust radius of 0.05 @xmath30 m , and the dotted line represents the lag time of @xmath53 with a dust radius of 0.25 @xmath30 m .",
    "the lag time approaches to 3.5 ks when the distance of the source exceeds 5 kpc for any dust radius .",
    "the range of grain radii used in the mrn model is [ 0.005 , 0.25 ] @xmath30 m , and the range of grain radii used in the weingartner @xmath26 drain ( 2001 ; wd01 ) model is also similar .",
    "therefore , the different @xmath70 , with different dust grain radii , would produce a lag of 3.5 ks for @xmath53 .",
    "the conclusion is that the result of section 5.1 is independent with the dust grain model . at the same time",
    ", we fit the lag time and with a single dust grain radius instead of the mrn dust grain model of section 5.3 .",
    "the best - fit result is @xmath71 kpc for 0.25 @xmath30 m , @xmath72 kpc for 0.05 @xmath30 m , and @xmath73 kpc for 0.005 @xmath30 m .",
    "the uncertainty from the dust model almost equals to the uncertainty of the statistical error of the distance of section 4.3 . by these results",
    ", we conclude that the distance of cyg x-3 we derived in this work is independent of the dust grain model .",
    "we applied the cross - correlation method to the light curves of cyg x-3 and found the time lag from the cross - correlation curves between the angles of 15@xmath4 to about 90@xmath4 .",
    "the time lags reveal that there are two components of dust distributions in the los toward cyg x-3 : a uniform distribution and a dust concentration . a likely candidate for the dust concentration",
    "is the cyg ob2 association . assuming the distance as 1.7 kpc for cyg ob2 another uniform dust distribution , we obtain a distance of @xmath0 kpc for cyg x-3 .",
    "multiple scattering makes no influence for the distance estimation in our analysis .",
    "the systematic uncertainty may come from the uncertainty of the distance of the cyg ob2 . when using the distance estimation of cyg ob2 as 1.38 or 1.82 kpc",
    ", the inferred distance for cyg x-3 is @xmath2 or @xmath3 kpc , respectively .    as discussed by predehl et al .",
    "2000 , the distance of cyg x-3 has been a puzzle for a long time . dickey ( 1983 ) has found a lower limit of 9.2 kpc using 21 cm wavelength absorption data .",
    "predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) derived 8 kpc as the distance through the galactic dust layer from their comparison of x - ray scattering and absorption .",
    "a distance of @xmath0 kpc is only about 3/4 to the previous result .",
    "for example , the estimation of velocity of the radio jet of cyg x-3 decrease from 0.5c to 0.36c ( mart et al .",
    "the new velocity is comparable with ss433 , which has a radio jet velocity of 0.26c ( milgrom 1979 ) . from our discussion , at small observational angle ( below 100 )",
    "the cross - correlation method is only weakly dependent of the photon energy , dust grain radius , scattering cross - section , and so on .",
    "therefore , the time lag derived by this method rests almost purely on geometry . for cyg x-3 , the distance estimation uncertainty is mainly related to the distance of the cyg ob2 association , which may be improved in the future with high - precision astrometric measurements .",
    "consequently , our results can be used to determine the parameter of the dust grain models in the future , when combined with the spatial distribution of the x - ray dust scattering halo ; currently no dust grain model can describe simultaneously the time lag and spatial distribution of x - ray dust scattering halo .",
