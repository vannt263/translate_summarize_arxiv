    "firstly @xmath85 is isomorphic to the subspace of @xmath22 of elements that are fixed by @xmath86 , hence it vanishes because @xmath45 is an irreducible representation . on the other hand , @xmath87 for @xmath88 , because @xmath33 has the homotopy type of a graph .",

    "we will not recall the definition , that can be found in @xcite , for instance .",
    "there are two main issues for the torsion we are interested in .",

    "[ prop : criterion ] if @xmath125 leaves invariant the image of @xmath126 , then @xmath127 .",

    "then in subsection  [ subsec : quadric ] we analyze properties of isotropic planes of @xmath140 , that are viewed as lines in a ruled quadric in @xmath141 .",
    "the properties of this ruled quadric are used in a deformation argument in subsection  [ subsection : firstdfm argument ] to conclude the proof when @xmath133 .      for a closed oriented @xmath142-manifold @xmath143 and a representation @xmath144 ,",
    "there is a nondegenrate pairing : @xmath145 which is the composition of the cup product and the map induced from the @xmath20-invariant pairing @xmath146 this pairing is bilinear , nondegenerate ( poincar duality ) and natural .",
    "in addition , when @xmath147 and @xmath137 it is symmetric ( because both the usual cup product and the determinant are antisymmetric ) .",
    "in particular , we have two symmetric pairings , for @xmath90 : @xmath148    the following lemma assumes that @xmath34 , as the whole section , though it only requires @xmath149 .",
    "[ lemma : spartial ] @xmath150 .    since @xmath34",

    "hence by lemma  [ lemma : spartial ] , @xmath157 .",
    "pulling back the pairings ( [ eqn : pairingmk ] ) by the isomorphism ( [ eqn : isos ] ) , we obtain two symmetric perfect pairings @xmath158    [ lemma : cup1cup2 ] both pairings are the same : @xmath159 .",
    "we use de rham cohomology for the proof .",
    "we first claim that every cohomolgy class in @xmath160 is represented by a form compactly supported in the interior of @xmath33 , using that @xmath161 .",
    "namely , let @xmath162 be any closed form and @xmath163 a tubular neighborhood of @xmath156 .",

    "the fact that the image is a plane follows from lemma  [ lem : cohomm_i ] and its proof .",
