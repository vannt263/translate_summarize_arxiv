    "the inner regions of circumstellar envelopes around asymptotic giant branch stars are still enigmatic .",
    "these regions , located further out than the pulsating outer atmosphere but typically within 100 stellar radii , are of interest for several reasons ; the circumstellar wind is accelerated here to its terminal velocity , the chemistry is ` frozen out ' approximately at its photospheric values , and dust nucleation and growth take place .",
    "this is important for the mass loss of the star , a process we do not understand how and why it occurs .",
    "for example , we do not know whether matter is ejected in puffs or in a steady , homogeneous wind .",
    "the mass loss returns matter to the interstellar medium and plays a vital role in the cosmic cycling and enrichment of matter , see for example @xcite . in order to study these inner regions we need to observe them in detail .",
    "however , very few observational constraints exist on the conditions in these complex regions .    by combining observations , sampling gas located at a distance on the sky of approximately 1@xmath3 and beyond , and a detailed modelling of the circumstellar envelopes one might be able to put constraints on the inner regions .",
    "@xcite observed scattered photospheric light in circumstellar vibration - rotational lines of co 2@xmath3@xmath17@xmath3 away from mira .",
    "they analysed the emission lines from the circumstellar envelope using a simple analytic approach , an analysis which suggested a time constant mass - loss rate , when averaged over 100 years , over the past 1200 years . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed analysis both of these observations and of those which tell us about the properties of the whole envelope .",
    "the modelling presented here provides a better insight into the conditions close to the star , and gives a larger degree of flexibility to test different models .",
    "_ o _ ceti ( mira or hd 14386 ) is the prototype of the mira class of long - period variables with characteristic pseudo - periodic brightness variations in time .",
    "they are cool , red giants on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) with considerable mass - loss rates and circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) of large extension .",
    "the visual - light variations are related to large - amplitude radial pulsations which cause a large variation of the effective temperature .",
    "note , that _ o _ ceti is a binary system .",
    "the angular distance between mira  a and the hot , compact companion star mira  b ( vz  ceti ) is 0.6@xmath3 ( karovska et al . 1993 ; 1997 ) .",
    "the companion could be a white dwarf with a mass of about 1m@xmath6 , a luminosity of 2l@xmath6 , and a temperature of more than 30000k [ these parameters are based on an analysis of international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra by @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite suggest it is embedded in an accretion disk , giving rise to an abnormal illumination of mira  a.    in general , the kinematics , the density and the temperature structures of cses of agb stars seem to be relatively simple , with an over - all spherical symmetry prevailing ( see , e.g. , olofsson 1996 ) .",
    "the stable and abundant co molecule is self - shielding @xcite and therefore of approximately constant abundance trough out the envelope .",
    "however , the chemical structure is certainly quite complex , restricting us to schematic modelling of these objects [ see for example @xcite ] .",
    "the lack of spatial resolution in the observations , nonetheless suggesting more complex geometries ( e.g. , stanek et al . 1995 ) , also hampers the analysis .",
    "the observations of co lines at millimeter wavelength in mira s wind indicate some complexity . an asymmetry is clearly visible in the radio - line profiles .",
    "a number of suggestions in the literature have been made for multi - wind scenarios , such as winds of different characteristics , jets , or other phenomena which introduce dramatic variations in the envelope structure with distance .",
    "thus , several combinations exist of mass - loss rates , expansion and turbulent velocities , which are able to reproduce the radio - line profiles fairly well .",
    "this means , for instance , that there is no consensus as regards the actual expansion velocity of mira s wind .",

    "we have used a monte - carlo ( mc ) approach to the multi - level , non - lte , radiative - transfer problem when modelling the circumstellar wind of mira .",
    "we have applied the methodology of @xcite to the transfer of line - radiation of co in a spherically symmetric and smooth cse , formed by a constant mass - loss rate , and expanding at a constant velocity .",
    "the inner and outer radii of the cse are used as the input for the modelling . for a more detailed description of the modelling ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the model is constructed by iteratively solving the equations of radiative transfer and the statistical equilibrium equations for the level populations of @xmath18co .",
    "the solution is found when a steady state of the populations , as a function of radial distance from the star , is achieved .",
    "the source function of the entire wind is thereby known , which makes possible a straight - forward calculation of the spectrum by the solution of the radiative transfer through the envelope along the line - of - sight , resulting in predicted intensities of the observed spectral lines as a function of the distance from the star .",
    "a draw - back of monte - carlo simulations in general is the slow convergence , typically scaling with @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantages are several .",
    "the programming can be done in close relation to the physical reality ; the radiation field can be taken into account in a correct manner , and inhomogeneities and complex geometries are relatively easily implemented .",
    "velocity fields and gradients of any size are allowed in the programming .    in our mc model ,",
    "complete angular and frequency redistribution is assumed , the absorption and the emission profiles being the same .",
    "thus , the local emission is assumed to be isotropic and the scattering is assumed to be incoherent .",
    "the distribution of frequency shifts given by the emission profile is defined by a gaussian doppler profile :    @xmath31.\\ ] ]    the width of this profile , @xmath32 , is given by the local , thermal broadening and the micro - turbulent broadening .",
    "the velocity field in the expanding wind will allow shifts from the line centre as given in the laboratory frame , @xmath33 .",
    "the velocity field is represented by the vector @xmath34 and the direction of the beam , i.e. the random direction of one emitted photon , by the unit vector @xmath35 .    for the rotational transitions , with spontaneous de - excitation rates of the order of @xmath36s@xmath7 ,",
    "the assumption of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) is a good assumption , since the collisions will have time to reset the frequency - memory of the excited atoms .",
    "however , for the vibrational - rotational transitions , with rates of the order of @xmath37s@xmath7 , this assumption may be a fallacy . for these infrared transitions , photons are more likely coherently scattered in frequency . the more scattering events , i.e. , the higher the radial optical depth in the wind , the more important it is that the model is made to properly take into account coherent scattering in the model .    by dividing every nir transition into a large number of subdivisions , but conserving the over - all line profile , we are able to simulate coherent scattering in the mc code . the absorption and the emission profiles are assumed to be the same .",
    "we find that for optical depths of the order of 50 or less , the difference between a crd and a coherent description of the nir transitions is less than the numerical noise , which is intrinsic to the mc method . for a mira model with a cse with an inner radius at 13r@xmath2 ,",
    "the radial optical depth is approximately 40 , which motivates our approach to run the model with all transitions in crd .",
    "measurements of the multi - wavelength angular diameter of mira @xcite , combined with trigonometric parallaxes measured with the hipparcos satellite @xcite , suggest a mean radius of ( 464@xmath1280)r@xmath6 .",

    "mira was at its maximum radius at this epoque according to @xcite .",
    "the iso and radio data were observed at other times , but are not as sensitive to the radiation field , and thereby to the phases of mira , as the nir data .",
    "these values of the model parameters of mira are consistent with the corresponding values obtained by , among others , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors arrive at similar temperatures ; a mean ( over phases ) effective temperature of @xmath42@xmath432800k .",

    "the model parameters we have adopted are given in table[parameters ] .",
    "the radiative energy input to the wind system originates from the central star and is specified by a luminosity and an effective temperature of the star and by a luminosity and effective temperature of the surrounding dust , cf .",
    "table[parameters ] .",
    "since the dust is concentrated close to the star @xcite , the ambient radiation from the dust further out in the cse is considered to be small and it is not taken into account in our model .",
    "the dust will absorb part of the stellar flux and re - radiate it in the infrared as thermal radiation .",
    "@xcite fit their observations with two spherically symmetric dust shells at 3 and 10 stellar radii , with inhomogeneities or clumps embedded in the spherically symmetric dust shells .",
    "@xcite fit their observations with a dust distribution which peaks at 2.7 stellar radii away from the star , and where the temperature is 1050@xmath11300k , depending on phase .",
    "also @xcite deduced an inner extension of the dust shell of about three stellar radii , and a dust temperature of 1200k .",
    "thus , the spatial dust distribution peaks at approximately 3 stellar radii with a temperature of about 1100k , leading to an upper limit of the re - radiated luminosity of 30% of the total bolometric luminosity ; 2700l@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite found , however , that the circumstellar dust in mira contributes less than 20% of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we therefore set the dust luminosity to be 1800l@xmath6 , implying a stellar contribution of 7100l@xmath6 .",
    "the former radiation , which is mainly in the infrared , is important for pumping vibrational states , leading to non - thermal level populations of the rotational states which could affect the nir line intensities .",
    "hence , we model the inner energy source with a spectral energy distribution consisting of two black - bodies , using the temperatures and luminosities above , see also table[parameters ] .",
    "the kinetic temperature structure of the gas affects the co level populations through collisions , modelled through collisional rates [ see the discussion by @xcite ] which are functions of the temperature .",
    "the temperature also affects the thermal broadening of the absorption and emission profiles .",
    "these are , however , mostly determined by the larger turbulent velocity .",
    "the gas temperature structure of the cse can be calculated in a self - consistent way in our model , by solving the energy balance equation of the system ( cf .",

    "this kinetic temperature structure and the excitation temperature structures calculated by the model are shown in figure[model2]b .",
    "mira  b certainly also adds mechanical energy to the circumstellar environment , which will lead to an additional heating .",
    "the nir lines are , however , radiatively excited and not greatly affected by the kinetic temperature of the surrounding gas / dust .",
    "the radio lines may , however , in principle be affected by their kinetic environment , but are formed further out where the influence of the binary star can be considered to be small",
    ".    the cse is characterised by the mass - loss rate of the star and the expansion velocity of the wind , which together give the density as a function of the radial distance from the star .",
    "the density of co will depend on the fractional abundance of co relative to the abundance of hydrogen molecules , h@xmath50 .",
    "this fractional abundance of @xmath18co molecules is assumed to be @xmath51@xmath105@xmath410@xmath52 @xcite throughout the wind .",
    "this is a value generally used for oxygen - rich envelopes , and the same value was adopted in @xcite . in the case of mira the mass - loss rate is relatively small , leading to an increased importance of the radiation field , especially for the nir lines ; see the discussion on the dusty envelope of the object iras15194 - 5115 with a high mass - loss rate , where the vibrational - rotational transitions are found to be unimportant @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18co molecule data are the same as those used by @xcite .",
    "we use 30 rotational levels for each of the ground and first vibrational states .",
    "this is generally sufficient in order to treat the co excitation in cses properly , cf .",
    "the collisional rates of the nir vibrational - rotational transitions are much smaller than the radiative de - excitation rates and they are set at zero in the model ( see for example ryde et al .",
    "the collisional rates of pure rotational transitions are non - zero .",
    "@xcite provide oscillator strengths , which for our transitions are consistent with @xcite .",

    "planesas et al . (",
    "for objects with low mass - loss rates , the nir , vibrational - rotational lines are sensitive to the stellar intensity , whereas pure rotational lines , such as the low rotational lines measured at radio wavelengths and the higher rotational lines observed with iso are usually more sensitive to the temperature structure .",
    "the vibrational - rotational lines are therefore probes of the light - absorbing properties of the inner regions .",
    "the estimated fluxes given by the model are sensitive to many of the input parameters .",
    "we have run our model by fixing as many parameters as possible from the literature .",
    "our variable parameters are the temperature ( @xmath47 ) at a distance from the star of 10@xmath48 cm , the mass - loss rate ( @xmath11 ) , the terminal expansion velocity ( @xmath8 ) and turbulent velocity ( @xmath9 ) , as well as the inner radius of the cse ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "note that there are systematic uncertainties in the r(1 ) line due to the detector , which will lead to an uncertain r(1)/r(3 ) ratio [ see the discussion by @xcite ; this has to be borne in mind when discussing the line ratios ] .",
    "the kitt peak observations provide our modelling with new , strong constraints .",
    "these are the nir absolute fluxes of the three lowest vibrational - rotational transitions in the r - branch of co , their radial distributions , and the two line ratios from the three vibrational - rotational lines observed .",
    "we find that it is not possible to meet these new constraints with a ` standard model ' of the wind , calculated on the basis of the several far - ir rotational transitions within the ground vibrational level of co as observed by iso , and radio observations of millimeter rotational transitions of co ; our modelled nir fluxes are an order of magnitude too low .    by introducing a cavity in order to simulate a higher flux at the point of scattering and keeping the mass - loss rate relatively high , however , we are able to model the nir fluxes and the brightness distribution , i.e. , the decline in the intensity as a function of the distance from the star , providing a slope ( d@xmath27 i / d@xmath28 ) of approximately @xmath13 .",
    "this results in few scatterers on the way and hence increase the number of photons that will be able to be scattered , and , on the other hand , maintains enough scatterers at the point of our observations for the modelled fluxes to be large enough .",
    "the important free parameters that couple to each other to give the number density of scatterers are the inner radius ( @xmath55 ) , the mass - loss rate ( @xmath11 ) , and the expansion velocity ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "thus , in order to reproduce the observed , high nir fluxes , the radial optical depth should not be too large . if there are too many scatterers on the way radially , many photons will scatter ` sideways ' due to the shifts out of the absorption profile caused by the velocity of the flow at a point close to the star and will never make it out to our point of observation .",
    "the high optical depths trap the photons as was suggested already by @xcite .",
    "thus , the velocity field is of great importance . if the _",
    "geometrical _ velocity gradients are large across one optical depth unit ( the mean distance between scattering events ) , the absorption profiles of the absorbing molecules will be shifted with respect to the emission profile of emitting molecules , leading to a decrease in the optical length for the emitted photons .",
    "this will lead to a loss of photons and a steepening of the decline of the intensity with distance from the star .",
    "an important quantity for the flux levels at a certain point in the wind is the relation between the expansion velocity , and the turbulent velocity ( providing most of the width of the inherent line profiles )",
    ". if the turbulent velocity , which is of the order of 1kms@xmath7 , is comparable to the wind velocity , the velocity fields will be very important .",
    "also in the case of mira , this makes the modelling of the cse sensitive to the ratio between the turbulent velocity and the flow velocity .",
    "this is also what we find ; a sensitive parameter in the modelling is this ratio . a physical reason for a higher flux could be a void of co molecules , for instance due to an excess uv flux from the white - dwarf companion - star that certainly will partly dissociate co , or a cavity caused by a decline of the stellar wind to a lower expansion velocity and a lower mass - loss rate , resembling the double wind scenario of @xcite .",
    "other reasons could be that the gas close to the star is in such a state that light is able to pass through relatively unaffected , either due to the medium being clumpy with a low filling factor , or by the matter being in radial structures in the innermost part of the cse , which , further - out , developes into more smooth or shell - like structures .",
    "these structures could occur depending on the expulsion mechanism of matter , such as a non - homogeneous mass - loss due to large convective eddies or magnetic spots , see for example @xcite .",
    "further reasons could be co molecules absorbed onto dust grains , which are evaporated further out , or a small radial velocity gradient ( i.e. , the velocity slowly approaches the terminal velocity of the wind ) .    for large radial optical depths , the slope ( d@xmath27 i / d@xmath28 ) will not be constant with distance as is suggested by the observations . in models for which the optical depths are taken to be very large , we find that the slope of the r(3 ) line is the largest . as a consequence ,",
    "the line ratios will vary greatly as a function of distance from mira which again is not observed .",
    "the line ratios r(1)/r(3 ) and r(2)/r(3 ) increase the further away from the star they are measured .",
    "( in a less optically thick model , the slopes will not differ greatly between the three lines and thus neither will the line ratios . ) in our observations , however , we will not be able to trace such a trend , having in mind the constraints due to signal - to - noise ratio and the uncertainties involved .",
    "the mass - loss rate determined here , 2.5@xmath410@xmath5m@xmath6yr@xmath7 , is in good agreement with the mass - loss rate we estimated using an analytic approach to mira s wind @xcite .",
    "note , however , that in this approach the level densities of co are not known and a mean is estimated , which will lead to an uncertainty , cf .",
    "fig.[pop ] . also , an assumption in the derivation of the analytical expression for the mass - loss rate is a _ tangentially _ optically thin wind , which is not strictly the case for a spherically symmetric and homogeneous wind . in",
    "a _ tangentially _ optically thin wind we expect a decline of the intensity with angular distance , given by a power law with an exponent of @xmath62 .",
    "however , even in a _ tangentially _ optically thick wind we are able to obtain the same d@xmath27 i / d@xmath28@xmath10@xmath13 slope .",
    "the asymmetries in the radio lines , which are optically thick , are caused , in our ` standard model ' , by self absorption along the line - of - sight .",
    "thus , we are able to reproduce the intensities and radio - line profiles reasonably well without invoking a double - wind scenario as has previously been done in the literature ( cf . e.g. , knapp et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "in order to reproduce the intensity levels and the angular dependence of the intensity of the vibrational - rotational lines of the co fundamental band at 4.6@xmath16 m ( @xmath63@xmath101@xmath150 ) , it is necessary to require low radial optical - depths to the point of scattering . in a standard cse model ,",
    "i.e. , a smooth and spherically symmetric wind with an inner radius located fairly close to the central star , the radial optical depths are very large .",
    "the photons are scattered already close to the star and , due to the velocity field , shifted out of the absorption profile , leading to an escape .",
    "the cse model that is able to meet these new observational constraints reasonably well needs a form of inner cavity , devoid of gaseous co. the stellar light is then able to reach further out before it is scattered ; the optical depths are reduced significantly .",
    "the two cse models presented here both require a mass - loss rate of 2.5@xmath410@xmath5m@xmath57yr@xmath7 and a turbulent velocity of 1.5kms@xmath7 given an expansion velocity of the wind of 2.5kms@xmath7 .",
    "the only parameter that is changed between the two models is the location of the inner radius . in the standard model ,",
    "that best reproduces the observed radio and fir emission , we use an inner radius located at approximately 13r@xmath2 while for the the cavity model , adopted to meet the nir observational constraints , its location is approximately 50r@xmath2 .    we find that the ratio between the turbulent velocity and the expansion velocity , is of great importance . the flux at 2@xmath3 is sensitive to this ratio ; the lower the ratio the lower the observed flux since more photons are lost ` sideways ' due to velocity shifts out of the absorption profile .",
    "furthermore , we conclude that for modelling vibrational - rotational lines the approximation of crd is not a bad assumption as long as the optical depths are not too large .",
    "the nir observations in combination with a model of the cse is providing us with new pieces of information on the inner - most regions of the wind .",
    "the properties of this inner wind , that is simulated in the model by a void of co , can be explained physically by structures of the gas close to the star ( within approximately 2@xmath3 ) that are in such a form that light is able to pass through .",
    "further observations of the gas in the stellar wind of mira slightly closer to the star could therefore be rewarding .",
    "the inner parts of the circumstellar environment are complicated regions of which we have a very limited understanding ( see e.g. , ryde et al . , 1999a ) , and where many of the basic assumptions of our model are certainly not valid .",
    "thus , the model could fail in describing reality .",
    "we need further observational constraints .",
    "the phoenix spectrometer makes it possible to use long - slit spectroscopy , which makes spatially resolved spectra along the slit attainable .",
    "the slit is then used to map the cse .",
    "however , no interferometric mappings of the cse of mira with a high enough spatial resolution exist .",
    "planesas et al .",
    "( 1990b ) presented observations with a resolution of 7.8@xmath3@xmath45.4@xmath3 using the owens valley millimeter - wave interferometer .",
    "the iram interferometer at plateau de bure can provide a spatial resolution of under 1@xmath3 .",
