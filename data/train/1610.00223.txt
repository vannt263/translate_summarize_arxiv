    "in ultracold atoms , the typical diluteness condition and short - range interactions can give rise to interesting universal relations among thermodynamic quantities of a many - body system .",
    "these universal relations are independent of the microscopic details of two - body interactions , and have stimulated much research interest . in a unitary fermi gas close to an @xmath0-wave scattering , for instance , the central quantity of these universal relations , tan s contact , has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "furthermore , the recent radio - frequency ( r.f . ) spectroscopic measurement near a @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance in @xmath2k atoms opens up new possibilities of studying universal relations and thermodynamics in higher partial - wave scattering channels  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it has also been shown recently that a whole family of contacts and universal relations exist in systems with higher partial - wave scattering  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this progress , we investigate universal relations and thermodynamics of a two - component degenerate fermi gas with coexisting @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave interactions .",
    "such a system can be experimentally prepared and probed with @xmath2k atoms near the magnetic field @xmath3 g . as the @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance here is also close to an @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance , the @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave interactions can be comparable in strength .",
    "it is then expected that the co - existence of both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave scattering channels can lead to interesting many - body properties .",
    "indeed , it has been shown very recently that , at zero temperature , an interesting hybridization of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave superfluid can be stabilized , which exhibit nontrivial pairing correlations  @xcite . in this work , we focus on thermodynamic properties of the normal state above the superfluid transition temperature .",
    "we first derive the general universal relations of a two - component ultracold fermi gas with coexisting @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave interactions . due to the orthogonality of two - body wave functions of different scattering channels ,",
    "the universal thermodynamic relations of the system , such as the adiabatic relations , pressure , and the energy functional , appear to be direct summations of contributions from @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave interactions .",
    "these universal relations are governed by a set of contacts , which can be associated with scatterings within different partial - wave channels .",
    "we then numerically evaluate the interaction energy as well as contacts in the high - temperature normal phase using second - order virial expansions .",
    "interestingly , due to the interplay of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave interactions on the many - body level , we find that the contacts , and hence the relevant thermodynamic properties behave differently from those with only @xmath0- or @xmath1-wave interaction potentials . the interplay of multiple partial - wave interactions also leaves experimentally detectable signatures in asymptotic behavior of momentum distribution and r.f .",
    "spectrum in the high - momentum , high - frequency regime .",
    "another interesting finding is that the interaction energy of the repulsive branch features abrupt changes across the @xmath1-wave resonances , which may serve as a unique signature for the coexistence of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave interactions in the system .",
    "our results can be readily checked experimentally for @xmath2k atoms near the @xmath3 g @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance , where the two scattering channels naturally coexist .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ 2 ] , starting from the two - body density matrix , we derive the general universal relations such as interaction energy , adiabatic relations , pressure relations , and the energy functional . in sec .",
    "[ 3 ] , we present the formalism of the quantum virial theorem , and express thermodynamic quantities such as the thermodynamic potential and interaction energy in the normal state using second virial coefficients . in sec .",
    "[ 4 ] , we numerically evaluate interaction energy and contacts using virial expansion calculations , adopting typical experimental parameters of @xmath2k atoms near the @xmath3 g @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance .",
    "we also calculate the asymptotic behavior of the momentum distribution and the r.f .",
    "spectrum in the large - momentum and large - frequency limit , respectively .",
    "finally , we summarize in sec .  [ 5 ] .",
    "in this section , we study the universal relations for a two - component , partially polarized fermi gas with both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave interactions . following the standard treatment ,",
    "we start from the two - body density matrix of the many - body system , decompose it into pair wave functions , and expand the pair wave functions in terms of the two - body wave functions . employing the asymptotic forms of the two - body wave functions in the regime @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the range of interaction potentials , we derive universal thermodynamic relations based on the two - body density matrices .",
    "importantly , these universal relations are governed by a set of contacts , which are associated , respectively , with @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave scattering channels . for the derivations in this section",
    ", we consider the general case where @xmath0-wave interactions between the two spin components ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath1-wave interactions between the same spins coexist .",
    "following the standard treatment , we consider the two - body density matrix for our many - body system @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are spin indices , and @xmath9 creates a fermion with spin @xmath10 at position @xmath11 .",
    "the two - body density matrix can be decomposed as  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the center - of - mass momentum of a pair , @xmath15 are the eigenvalues , and @xmath16 label the quantum numbers of the relative radial direction , the angular momentum , and the @xmath17-axis projection of angular momentum , respectively .",
    "moreover , the associated pair wave functions @xmath18 form an orthonormal set .    for the system under consideration",
    ", the only nonvanishing pair wave functions are @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the spin wave functions are defined as @xmath21 and the spatial wave functions @xmath22 here , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the quantization volume , and @xmath26 is the relevant spherical harmonic function .",
    "correspondingly , we denote the relevant eigenvalues as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , for the @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave pair wave functions , respectively .",
    "we may then write down the interaction energy of the many - body system in terms of the two - body density matrix , and expand the pair wave functions therein using two - body radial wave functions .",
    "the resulting interaction energy reads @xmath29.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have defined a set of contacts @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which are related to the scattering length @xmath32 , the scattering volume @xmath33 , and effective range @xmath34 , respectively @xmath35 note that the integration over @xmath36 here includes the contributions of the bound states .",
    "note that the orthogonality of the two - body wave functions in different scattering channels renders the interaction energy in eq .   a direct summation of contributions from the three scattering channels : one with the @xmath0-wave interaction between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and two with the @xmath1-wave interaction between two @xmath37s or two @xmath38s . as a result",
    ", different scattering channels are decoupled in the definition of contacts as well .",
    "as we will see , this effectively allows us to write down the universal relations based on an intuitive extension of the previous works on single - partial - wave interactions .",
    "the importance of contacts is that they appear in various universal relations and provide a link between few - body parameters and many - body quantities .",
    "this link is most apparent in the so - called adiabatic relations .",

    "contacts from different scattering channels are decoupled .",
    "we may therefore identify @xmath0-wave contact and @xmath1-wave contacts based on the adiabatic relations .",
    "we then numerically evaluate the interaction energy and contacts using second - order virial expansions . for typical experimental parameters corresponding to @xmath2k atoms",
    ", we find that when the interplay of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave interactions is properly taken into account , all contacts behave differently from those with a single scattering channel .",
    "we characterize in detail the dependence of contacts on quantities such as spin polarization , temperature , and magnetic field .",
