    "the embedding of inflationary scenarios in supergravity has been studied for over three decades by now .",
    "the first supergravity implementation of the chaotic inflation scenario in supergravity was proposed back in 1983 @xcite , just a few months after the invention of the general chaotic inflation paradigm @xcite .",
    "it was based on the theory of a single chiral superfield with a plateau - type inflaton potential .",
    "its predictions perfectly match the presently available observational data .    a subsequent development of inflation in supergravity shifted in the direction of flexibility of the models .",
    "the models offering a functional freedom of the choice of the inflaton potentials have been proposed only relatively recently , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "most of the new models involved more than one chiral multiplet .",
    "for example , one may start with a broad class of theories @xcite of two fields , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with the superpotential @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a real holomorphic function such that @xmath9 .",
    "the potential can be chosen to have functional form @xmath10 in this case , the potential does not depend on @xmath11 .",
    "the potential energy @xmath12 in this class of models has an extremum at @xmath13 .",
    "if this extremum is in fact a minimum , which can be achieved by a proper choice of the  potential , inflation occurs along the direction @xmath13 , and the field @xmath11 plays the role of the canonically normalized inflaton field with the potential @xmath14 all scalar fields have canonical kinetic terms along the inflationary trajectory @xmath15 .",
    "alternatively , one can take @xmath16 and @xmath17 . then",
    ", the potential does not depend on @xmath18 , which plays the role of the inflaton field with the potential @xmath19 .",
    "one may also construct successful inflationary models using logarithmic potentials such as @xmath20 @xcite .    in the cases described above",
    ", we have 2 superfields , with 4 scalar degrees of freedom , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath11 and @xmath18 , but only one of them , corresponding to the inflaton field , participates in the cosmological evolution . due to the consistency of this truncation",
    ", it is simple to investigate inflation in this scenario , and one can easily find functions @xmath8 which yield any desirable values of the cosmological parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in some models , one should take special care of stability of the field @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "it can be done either by adding terms @xmath27 to the  potential @xcite , or by using a nilpotent chiral field @xmath25 which does not have scalar degrees of freedom @xcite . in this last case ,",
    "the cosmological evolution is described by a single unconstrained chiral superfield @xmath28 . moreover",
    ", one can generalize these inflationary models in such a way that they will also describe the present stage of the cosmological acceleration with a tiny cosmological constant @xmath29 and with a flexible scale of supersymmetry breaking , without introducing additional unconstrained chiral superfields @xcite .",
    "recently , a new class of inflationary theories with a single chiral superfield @xmath28 was proposed by ketov and terada ( kt ) @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , one may consider a logarithmic potential of the form [ kk ] k= -3 .",
    "the term with constant parameter @xmath30 serves to stabilize the field @xmath18 during inflation at @xmath31 .",
    "the main idea is that by making @xmath30 sufficiently large one can make the field component @xmath11 heavy and constrained to a very small range of its values , @xmath32 , so it plays almost no role during inflation with the inflaton field @xmath33 . for superpotentials w = 12 f(-2",
    "i ) , where @xmath34 is a real function of its argument , the potential along the inflaton direction @xmath32 becomes [ quadr ] v ^2  .",
    "for example , for @xmath35 one recovers the simplest chaotic inflation potential @xmath36 along the direction @xmath37 .",
    "a numerical investigation of this scenario in @xcite confirms that for sufficiently large @xmath30 , the field @xmath11 practically vanishes during the main part of inflation .",
    "its evolution begins only at the very end of inflation , so the cosmological predictions almost exactly coincide with the predictions of the quadratic scenario . at the end of inflation ,",
    "the field rolls down towards its supersymmetric minkowski vacuum at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and supersymmetry is restored .    a similar conclusion is indeed valid for a large variety of superpotentials @xmath41 , but not for all of them . in particular , we will show that one can have a consistent inflationary scenario in the theory with the simplest superpotential @xmath42 , but both fields @xmath11 and @xmath18 evolve and play an important role . at the end of inflation , the field may roll to a minkowski vacuum with @xmath43 or to a ds vacuum with a tiny cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "this is an encouraging result , since a complete cosmological model must include both the stage of inflation and the present stage of acceleration of the universe , and our simple model with a linear potential successfully achieves it .",
    "however , this success comes at a price : in this model , supersymmetry after inflation is strongly broken and the gravitino mass is @xmath44 gev , which is much greater than the often assumed tev mass range .    in view of this result",
    ", one may wonder what will happen if one adds a tiny correction term @xmath45 to the superpotential of the inflationary models described in @xcite with supersymmetric minkowski vacua .",
    "naively , one could expect that , by a proper choice of small complex numbers @xmath46 and @xmath47 , one can easily interpolate between the ads , minkowski and ds minima . in particular , one could think that for small enough values of these parameters , one can conveniently fine - tune the value of the vacuum energy , uplifting the original supersymmetric minimum to the desirable ds vacuum energy with @xmath0 .",
    "however , the actual situation is very different .",
    "we will show that adding a small term @xmath45 always shifts the original minkowski minimum down to ads , which does not correctly describe our world .",
    "moreover , unless the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are exponentially small , the negative cosmological constant in the ads minimum leads to a rapid collapse of the universe .",
    "for example , adding a tiny constant @xmath48 leads to a collapse within a time scale much shorter than its present age .",
    "thus , the cosmological predictions of the models of @xcite with one chiral superfield and a supersymmetric minkowski vacuum are incredibly unstable with respect to even very tiny changes of the superpotential .",
    "of course one could forbid such terms as @xmath45 by some symmetry requirements , but this would not address the necessity to uplift the minkowski vacuum to @xmath0 .    while we will illustrate this surprising result using kt models as an example ,",
    "the final conclusion is very general and valid for a much broader class of theories with a supersymmetric minkowski vacuum ; see a discussion of a related issue in @xcite .",
    "we will show that this result is a consequence of the recently established no - go theorem of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which is valid for arbitrary  potentials and superpotentials and also applies in the presence of multiple superfields :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ one can not deform a stable supersymmetric minkowski vacuum with a positive definite mass matrix to a non - supersymmetric de sitter vacuum by an infinitesimal change of the potential and superpotential .",

    "since the mass of the sgoldstino is set by the order parameter of supersymmetry breaking , it must vanish in the limit where supersymmetry is restored .",
    "the only susy minkowski vacua that are continuously connected to a branch of non - supersymmetric extrema therefore necessarily have a flat direction to start with : this is the scalar field that will play the role of the sgoldstino after spontaneous susy breaking .",
    "a corollary of this theorem is that one can not obtain a ds vacuum from a stable susy minkowski vacuum by a small deformation .",
    "as we will see , this is exactly what forbids a small positive cc after an infinitesimal change of the kt starting point .",
    "as often happens , the no - go theorem does not mean that uplifting of the supersymmetric minkowski minimum to a ds minimum is impossible . in order to achieve",
    "that , the modification of the superpotential should be substantial",
    ". we will show how one can do it , thus giving a detailed illustration of how this no - go theorem works and how one can overcome its conclusions by changing the parameters of the correction term @xmath45 beyond certain critical values .",
    "for example , one can take @xmath49 and slowly increase @xmath46 . for small values of @xmath46",
    ", the absolute minimum of the potential corresponds to a supersymmetric ads vacuum .",
    "when the parameter @xmath46 reaches a certain critical value , the minimum of the potential ceases to be supersymmetric , but it is still ads . with a further increase of @xmath46 ,",
    "the minimum is uplifted and becomes a non - supersymmetric ds vacuum state .",
    "once again , we will find that the modification of the superpotential required for the tiny uplifting of the vacuum energy by @xmath29 leads to a strong supersymmetry breaking , with the gravitino mass many orders of magnitude greater than what is usually expected in supergravity phenomenology .",
    "this problem can be solved by introducing additional chiral superfields responsible for uplifting and supersymmetry breaking . however",
    ", this may require an investigation of inflationary evolution of multiple scalar fields , unless the additional fields are strongly stabilized @xcite or belong to nilpotent chiral multiplets @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will discuss the possibility to realize inflation and dark energy with a  potential supplemented with a superpotential consisting of a constant and linear part .",
    "this is generalized to include a quadratic term in section 3 .",
    "we conclude in section 4 , while in the appendix we elucidate the vacuum structure of the model studied in section 2 .",
    "to understand the basic features of the theories with the  potential , it is instructive to calculate the coefficient @xmath50 in front of the kinetic term of the field @xmath28 . for an arbitrary choice of the superpotential ,",
    "this coefficient is given by g(,)= 3 ( 1 + 32 ^2 ^6 - 8 ^2 ( 3 + ) ) ( 3 + + 4 ^4)^2  .",
    "this function does not depend on @xmath18 . for small @xmath11",
    "the fields are canonically normalized .",
    "@xmath50 is positive at small @xmath11 , while it vanishes and becomes negative for larger values of @xmath51 ( provided @xmath52 ) .",
    "thus the kinetic term is positive definite only in a certain range of its values , depending on the constant @xmath30 . in this paper",
    ", we will usually take @xmath53 , to simplify the comparison with @xcite , see fig . [ 1 ] .     as a function of @xmath11 for @xmath53.,width=264 ]",
    "it is equally important that the expression for the potential @xmath12 in this theory , for any superpotential , contains the coefficient @xmath54 in the denominator , so it becomes infinitely large exactly at the boundaries of the moduli space where the kinetic term vanishes ( for @xmath55 , the boundaries are located at @xmath56 ) . for large @xmath30 ,",
    "the domain where @xmath57 is positive definite becomes more and more narrow , which is why the field @xmath11 becomes confined in a narrow interval , whereas the field @xmath18 is free to move and play the role of the inflaton field .",
    "this is very similar to the mechanism of realization of chaotic inflation proposed earlier in a different context in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "we will study inflation in this class of theories by giving some examples , starting from the simplest ones .",
    "the simplest superpotential to consider is a constant one , @xmath58 . in this case , the potential does not depend on the field @xmath18 .",
    "it blows up , as it should , at sufficiently large @xmath11 , and it vanishes at @xmath37 , see fig .",
    "this potential does not describe inflation .    .",
    "for @xmath59 , it blows up at @xmath60 , and it does not depend on the field @xmath18 , forming a narrow minkowski valley surrounded by infinitely steep walls.,width=377 ]    as a next step , we will consider a superpotential with a linear term w = m ( c+1 )  . in this case , just as in the case considered above , the potential has an exactly flat direction at @xmath37 , but now the potential at @xmath37 is equal to v(= 0 , ) = m^2c ( c-23 )  .",
    "thus for @xmath61 it is an ads valley , but for @xmath62 it is a ds valley . but",
    "this does not tell us the whole story . at large @xmath18 ,",
    "the minimum of the potential in the @xmath11 direction is approximately at @xmath37 , but at smaller @xmath18 , the minimum shifts towards positive @xmath11 . for and",

    "can easily adjust the potential to have the desirable value @xmath29 at the minimum .",

    ", it has a ds valley , and a near - minkowski minimum at @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "inflation happens when the field slowly moves along the nearly flat valley and then rolls down towards the minimum of the potential .",
    "it is a two - field inflation , which can not be properly studied by assuming that @xmath37 during the process.,width=377 ]    inflation in this models happens when the field slowly moves along the nearly flat valley and then rolls down towards the minimum of the potential .",
    "it is a two - field dynamics , which can not be properly studied by assuming that @xmath37 during the process , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the potential along the direction @xmath37 is exactly constant , so the field would not even move if we assumed that during its motion .",
    "however , because of the large curvature of the potential in the @xmath11 direction , during inflation this field rapidly reaches an inflationary attractor trajectory and then adiabatically follows the position of the minimum of the potential @xmath66 for any given value of the field @xmath67 .",
    "this can be confirmed by a numerical investigation of the combined evolution of the two fields whose dynamics is shown in fig .",

    "the adiabatic approximation of the effective potential ( dashed red line ) and the contour plot of @xmath66 in logarithmic scale are shown as superimposed .",
    "there is an initial stage of oscillations before the field approaches the inflationary attractor , as well as the final stage of post - inflationary oscillations .",
    "however , during inflation , which happens between these two oscillatory stages , the field accurately follows the position of the adiabatically changing minimum of the potential @xmath68 .",
    ", width=302 ]    then , the adiabatic approximation of the effective potential driving inflation reads v ( ( ) , ) = m^2c ( c-23 ) - , neglecting higher order terms which play no role in the inflationary plateau .",
    "the effective fall - off of @xmath69 is responsible for determining the main properties of a fully acceptable inflationary scenario .",
    "this investigation shows that this simplest model leads to a desirable amplitude of inflationary perturbations for @xmath70 , in planck units .",
    "the inflationary parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 in this model are given by ( at leading order in @xmath71 ) @xmath72 numerically , we find @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 , in excellent agreement with the leading @xmath71 approximation .",
    "we checked that the values of @xmath23 remains approximately the same in a broad range of @xmath30 , from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath24 slightly changes but remains in the @xmath78 range . as of now ,",
    "all of these outcomes are in good agreement with the planck data",
    ".    however , this simplest inflationary model has a property which is shared by all other models of this class to be discussed in this paper : supersymmetry is strongly broken in the minimum of the potential . in particular , for @xmath59 , the superpotential at the minimum is given by @xmath79 , and the gravitino mass is @xmath80 , in planck units , i.e. @xmath81 gev .",
    "this is many orders of magnitude higher than the gravitino mass postulated in many phenomenological models based on supergravity .    of course ,",
    "supersymmetry may indeed be broken at a very high scale , but nevertheless this observation is somewhat worrisome .",
    "one could expect that this is a consequence of the simplicity of the model that we decided to study , but we will see that this result is quite generic .",
    "as a second example , we will discuss the next simplest model , defined by [ wquad ] w= m ^2 .",
    "this case was one of the focuses of @xcite and gives rise to a quadratic inflationary potential .",
    "as we will demonstrate , perturbing such a superpotential by means of a linear and constant term , leads to general properties which are shared by the class discussed in the previous section .",
    "we will start by perturbing this model via a constant term such as [ wd ] w= m ( ^2 + d ) .",
    "the inflationary regime is unaffected by such correction and the scalar potential still reads @xmath82 , at @xmath83 .",
    "however , the vacuum of @xmath66 will move away from the supersymmetric minkowski minimum , originally placed at @xmath84 , but just in the @xmath11-direction ( because the superpotential is symmetric ) . then , for small parameter values , the minimum of @xmath11 moves as _ 0= d - d^2 .",
    "this shift immediately leads to an ads phase which , at small values of @xmath47 , goes as v_0= -m^2d^2 , which is fully in line with the no - go theorem @xcite summarized in the introduction .",
    "these solutions do not break supersymmetry and they can be obtained by the equation @xmath85 . as @xmath86 increases , such a susy vacuum moves further away from the origin and , at one point , it crosses the singular boundary of the moduli space .",
    "then , if we search for numerical solutions within the strip corresponding to the correct sign of the kinetic terms ( this means for @xmath87 ) , we run into a feature which will be common also in other examples : for specific values of @xmath47 , the susy - branch of vacuum solutions leaves the fundamental physical domain @xmath87 and it is replaced by a new branch of vacua with broken supersymmetry .",
