    "in recent years , quantum information has discovered the non - trivial advantages offered by continuous variable systems , i.e. , quantum systems described by a set of observables , like position and momentum , having a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues @xcite .",

    "this    measurement is called heterodyne detection and is equivalent to a    balanced beam splitter followed by two homodyne detectors .",
    "we call    heterodyne  ( @xmath5 ) the corresponding protocol    hetero , hetero2 .    in both protocols , alice and bob finally share pairs of correlated continuous variables .",

    "even if these protocols belong to the so - called prepare and measure ( pm ) schemes , they can be equivalently formulated in terms of einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) schemes , where alice and bob extract a secret key from the correlated outcomes of the measurements made upon a shared epr _ _",

    "one can easily show that heterodyning one mode of this epr  source is equivalent to the remote preparation of a coherent state @xmath11 whose amplitude @xmath12 is randomly modulated by a gaussian of variance @xmath13 ( see appendix ) .",

    "however , since these interactions are generally different , they can be classically correlated , i.e. , specified by correlated parameters @xcite .",
    "a general analysis of these asymmetric gaussian attacks  is very difficult .",
