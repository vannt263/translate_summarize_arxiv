    "material bodies moving within a surrounding fluid are typically subject to a force associated with the fluid - body interaction .",
    "for instance , in the case of a photon gas this force acts like a friction contrasting the particle motion , as first considered by poynting @xcite and robertson @xcite .",
    "the force term entering the equations of motion was given there by the 4-momentum density of radiation observed in the particle s rest frame with a multiplicative constant factor expressing the strength of the interaction itself .",
    "in the present paper we follow the same approach to investigate the general features of particle motion in a schwarzschild spacetime region filled with a fluid with equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 characterizes different kind of fluids , from massive free scalar fields ( @xmath2 ) , to non - relativistic dust ( @xmath7 ) , all the way down deep into the so - called phantom \" energy ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "as it is well known from mathematical cosmology @xcite , the parameter @xmath1 has a profound influence on the time evolution of the universe .",
    "for instance , in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models it determines the power law exponent of the scale factor as a function of time .",
    "according to our analysis , which relies on an explicit form of the fluid - particle interaction , the parameter @xmath1 plays a major role also in discriminating among different types ( escape versus capture ) of particle motion , for a given black hole spacetime metric . in particular , it is shown that the condition @xmath8 ( the case of a cosmological constant ) identifies with geodesic motion in the schwarzschild metric , and sets the borderline between capture ( positive sign ) and escape ( negative sign ) , respectively .",
    "this sharp borderline could in principle lead to measurable effects , hence new hints on the nature of the cosmological matter , based on the observation of the motion of test particles embedded in the cosmological fluid surrounding a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we begin by writing the schwarzschild metric in the standard form [ sch ] ds^2=-n^2dt^2+n^-2dr^2+r^2(d^2+^2d^2 ) , with the lapse function `` @xmath9 given by n= , where @xmath10 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "the metric ( [ sch ] ) is static , i.e. , @xmath11 is a hypersurface - forming timelike killing vector .",
    "observers at rest with respect to the coordinates ( or static observers '' ) have their @xmath12-velocity vector aligned along the killing direction itself , namely u = n^-1_t . an orthonormal frame @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) adapted to them",
    "is given by @xmath15    for later use , let us introduce co - rotating @xmath16 and counter - rotating @xmath17 circular timelike geodesic orbits on the equatorial plane @xmath18 , characterized by the keplerian \" @xmath12-velocity u_k=_k ( u_k e_)=_k ( _ t _ k _ ) , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with [ kepler ] _",
    "k=,_k=. these orbits only exist for @xmath21 .",
    "next , let us consider a ( test ) perfect fluid , superposed to the schwarzschild spacetime , described by the following stress - energy tensor @xcite [ tensorefotoni2 ] t^(r)= _ 0(r ) , i.e. , with equation of state @xmath22 , where @xmath1 is a constant characterizing the type of cosmic fluid , as detailed below .",
    "the form of @xmath23 is obtained by integrating the equations @xmath24 ; in this case , due to spherical symmetry of the background , the solution of these equations is easily obtained , i.e. , _ 0(r)= _",
    "0^ n^- , where @xmath25 is a constant representing the value of the energy density at infinity . noted values of @xmath1 in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) are as follows :    * @xmath2 : massive free scalar field ; * @xmath26 : radiation ; * @xmath7 : dust ( non - relativistic matter ) ; * @xmath27 : quintessence ; * @xmath28 : cosmological constant ; * @xmath3 : phantom energy .",
    "as is well known , each of these values corresponds to a different growth of the cosmological scale factor in the simple frw model , that is @xmath29 .",
    "this shows that the capture scenario , i.e. , @xmath4 , corresponds to initial time singularities ( big - bang ) , whereas the escape scenario , i.e. , @xmath30 , associates with finite - time future singularities ( big - rip ) ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "based on the energy momentum tensor ( [ tensorefotoni2 ] ) , we model the force acting on a massive particle with @xmath12-velocity @xmath31 , in the form of a linear drag term , proportional to the particle velocity [ frad_gen ] f_(scat)(u)_=- p(u ) _",
    "t^_u^ , where [ udef ] u=(u+^a e_a),=(1-_ab^a^b)^-1/2 , @xmath32 projects orthogonally to @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a numerical coefficient .",
    "this expression for the scattering force has been already used in the literature to study radiation scattering @xcite . in that case , @xmath35 models the absorption and consequent re - emission of radiation by the particle . here , we extend its form in such a way as to cover more general situations . the entire discussion about deviations from geodesic motion given below relies on this choice of the force .",
    "although by no means unique , the definition ( [ frad_gen ] ) has the merit of mathematical simplicity , as combined with a clear physical basis .    the motion of a massive particle is thus governed by the equations [ eq_mot_gen ] m a(u)=f_(scat)(u ) , where @xmath36 denotes the particle @xmath12-acceleration with frame components @xmath37\\,,\\nonumber \\\\ a(u)^{\\hat \\phi}&= & \\frac{d ( \\gamma \\nu^{\\hat \\phi})}{d\\tau}+\\frac{\\gamma^2}{r\\sin\\theta}[n\\sin \\theta",
    "\\nu^{\\hat r}+\\cos \\theta \\nu^{\\hat \\theta}]\\nu^{\\hat \\phi}\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 have been introduced in eq .",
    "( [ kepler ] ) . from the orthogonality condition @xmath40 , the following relation holds [ formula_acc ] a(u)^t=_r a(u)^r+",
    "a(u)^. in the sequel , we shall focus on the special case of a particle confined to the equatorial plane ( @xmath18 ) , namely with @xmath41 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath42 and the remaining components simplify to @xmath43 the general equatorial motion is thus fully described by the following equations @xmath44\\,,\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{d   \\nu^{\\hat \\phi}}{d\\tau } & = &   \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\left(\\frac{a(u)_{\\hat \\phi}}{\\gamma_\\phi^2}- a(u)_{\\hat r}\\nu^{\\hat r}\\nu^{\\hat \\phi}\\right ) -\\frac{\\gamma n}{\\gamma_k^2 r}\\nu^{\\hat r}\\nu^{\\hat \\phi}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , once the acceleration components are replaced by the force components according to @xmath47 the evolution equations for the radial and azimuthal coordinates follow directly from the definition of @xmath33 ( see eq .",
    "( [ udef ] ) ) , i.e. , @xmath48    we note that when @xmath28 , the force term @xmath49 vanishes identically , implying geodesic motion . therefore ,",
    "if the superposed fluid corresponds to a cosmological constant term in the einstein s equations , the interaction between particles and gas can not be modeled by eq .",
    "( [ frad_gen ] ) .",
    "this is exactly the case of the de sitter spacetime .",
    "in fact , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 being the cosmological constant , we have t_u^=-u _ , which vanishes upon projecting orthogonally to @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", a more elaborate force term should be used .",
    "let us further note that at @xmath28 there is a sign change in the force , yielding an outward push as @xmath3 .",
    "this sign change holds the key to the transition from capture to escape scenarios .    moving to a polar representation of the velocity ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the above equations take the following form @xmath54 where the interaction parameter a= _ 0^ , has been introduced so that @xmath55 identifies the equatorial geodesic case .",
    "note that the presence of @xmath56 affects only the first equation of ( [ poleqs ] ) .",
    "apart from very special situations , the analysis of these equations can only be performed numerically . figs .",
    "[ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] show typical orbits for the same choice of initial conditions , but different values of the interaction strength parameter @xmath56 , at different values of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "simple inspection shows that values of @xmath57 ( @xmath3 ) imply capture ( escape ) from the hole , as already stated . in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , escaping orbits are characterized by a monotonically increasing speed , up to the speed of light .",
    "this does not occur in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , due to the very small value of the coupling parameter @xmath56 . in both cases , however , the deviations from geodesic motion are clearly appreciated .    .",
    "the solid lines starting at @xmath58 ( with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) represent the particle motion associated with the scattering of the fluid , with parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "the short - dashed curve corresponds to @xmath28 , hence to geodesic motion . with this choice of @xmath56 ,",
    "all particles scattered by a fluid with @xmath64 fall into the hole .",
    "negative values of @xmath65 , instead , allow particles to escape capture , and imply a sudden increase of the speed , which reaches the speed of light , i.e. , @xmath66 , in a finite time ( in order to preserve the causality condition for the particle world line , the numerical integration has been stopped at @xmath66 ) . ]    , but with @xmath67 and @xmath68 $ ] . with this choice of @xmath56 ( denoting a weaker interaction with respect to the previous case ) , escaping particles ( @xmath3 ) never reach the speed of light . ]      in principle , it is interesting to consider multi - component fluid scenarios , in which the matter around the hole corresponds to regions of different fluids ( with different @xmath1 ) , superposed to the schwarzschild background .",
    "this is only an approximation , since the various ( ideal ) fluids in the different regions would rapidly mix and yield a mixture with intermediate values of @xmath1 .",
    "however , if only as a hypothetical speculation , it is of interest to explore the way the equation for @xmath69 ( and only that ) slightly modifies to account for the presence of multi - component matter , say with @xmath70 components , associated with the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 . the new evolution equation for @xmath69 is thus given by @xmath73 explicitly , for @xmath74 we have , for example , @xmath75 this is equivalent to a heterogeneous mixture with a radially - dependent @xmath1 parameter , namely w(r)= , where we have set @xmath76 .",
    "one may then consider the presence of both ordinary or exotic matter , with special choices of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "numerical integration of the orbits in this case , confirms the previous analysis , namely that the dominating value of @xmath1 determines the final fate , capture or escape , of the particle trajectory .",
    "a more in depth analysis of the multi - component fluid scenario will make the object of future investigations .",
    "the motion of massive test particles interacting with a perfect fluid superposed to a schwarzschild black hole is investigated .",
    "the equation of state describing the fluid is taken as @xmath79 , which corresponds to different physical scenarios for different walues of @xmath1 , from ordinary matter to exotic matter .",
    "the interaction with the fluid distribution is modeled by a force term entering the equations of motion given by the 4-momentum density observed in the particle s rest frame with a multiplicative constant factor expressing the strength of the interaction itself .",
    "deviations from geodesic motion are analyzed for different values of the scattering parameter as well as of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the latter turns out to be crucial in distinguishing among capture ( @xmath64 ) or escape ( @xmath80 ) from the black hole .",
