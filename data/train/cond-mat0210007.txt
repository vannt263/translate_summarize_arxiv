    "the statistical mechanics of fluctuating lines and surfaces is a subject of great interest , which poses fundamental problems and has remained challenging for more than 20 years . one particular universality class , which has been studied extensively in the past , are polymerized or `` tethered '' membranes @xcite . these are two - dimensional networks , where the bond - length fluctuates , but never breaks up . in the high - temperature regime",
    "nearest - neighbor interactions can be modeled by a harmonic potential . neglecting self - avoidance , the membrane is extremely crumpled and highly folded , a property , which is characterized by the universal radius - of - gyration exponent @xmath5 , defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the radius of gyration , and @xmath8 is the linear internal size .",
    "physically , @xmath9 , but in the absence of interactions , the radius of gyration grows only logarithmically with the internal size .    for a more realistic description one",

    "the edwards model successfully describes long polymers @xcite .",
    "much effort has been spent to extend these results to membranes ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the problem is , that the usual @xmath15-expansion about the upper critical dimension is not feasible , since the latter is infinity .",
    "an important idea was therefore to generalize ( [ i.1 ] ) to manifolds of arbitrary internal dimension @xmath16 .",
    "one then studies the @xmath16-dimensional manifold problem , and finally continuous analytically to @xmath14 .",
    "a major breakthrough was the proof of perturbative renormalizability @xcite to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this procedure was carried out to two loops @xcite resulting in a radius - of - gyration exponent of @xmath17 .",
    "this is a strong correction over the non - interacting theory with @xmath18 , but may still be in contradiction to monte - carlo simulations , which often but not consistently find tethered membranes in a flat phase with @xmath19 @xcite . while simulations are very demanding and therefore not yet conclusive , it is nevertheless compelling to try to identify possible mechanisms , which might render flexible membranes flat at all scales .",
    "such a mechanism has indeed been found for rigid membranes , where fluctuations strongly renormalize rigidity @xcite .    here",
    "we study a simplified model , and solve it _ exactly _ at @xmath14 .",
    "it corresponds to a gaussian elastic manifold interacting by excluded volume with a single @xmath20-like impurity in external space@xcite",

    "( [ i.2 ] ) has essential features in common with sam : its critical embedding dimension tends to infinity as the internal dimension approaches @xmath14 .",
    "this can be read off from the dimension of the coupling @xmath0 , which is @xmath23=:\\varepsilon = d -\\frac{2-d}{2}d \\ .\\ ] ] thus , calculating universal quantities within the @xmath24-expansion necessitates similar techniques as for sam , and we expect to learn more from the solution of the toy - model ( [ i.2 ] ) .",
    "recently , we have been able @xcite to sum the perturbative expansion _",
    "exactly _ in @xmath14 .",
    "the key - idea was , that when approaching @xmath14 , the correlator which enters all perturbative calculations , becomes essentially flat . in order to check the consistency of the results obtained by that method",
    ", one would like to go away from @xmath14 , and hopefully smoothly connect to polymers in @xmath3 , which are well enough studied to check almost any quantity . in @xcite , we have done a first step in that direction , and obtained quite promising results in first order in @xmath25 .",
    "however , the expansion in @xmath25 is not a loop - expansion , and at each order in @xmath25 , we have to resum an infinite number of diagrams .",
    "it turns out , that the results thus become very sensitive to the regularization procedure . in this letter",
    ", we pursue this road further , calculating contributions to the partition - function _ exactly _ for a manifold of toroidal or spherical shape .",
    "we obtain the expansion up to order @xmath4 .",
    "this information can then be used to extrapolate away from @xmath14 . however , since we find that at @xmath14 , the fixed point is at infinity , one needs additional constraints , i.e.  a scaling function , in order to be able to use this result .",
    "we have not been able to settle this question , despite the tremendous information contained in the perturbative result .",
    "we thus present our `` raw data '' , together with some possible scaling - functions , encouraging the reader to think himself about the missing link .",

    "about @xmath69 below @xmath14 one has to expand the loop integrand @xmath91 in powers of @xmath92 . for convenience , we take @xmath57 .",
    "the propagator ( [ com.0 ] ) takes in infinite @xmath16-space the form @xmath93 , where @xmath94 denotes the volume of the @xmath16-dimensional unit - sphere .",
