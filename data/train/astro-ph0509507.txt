    "the relative flux calibration is correct but the absolute flux is uncertain .",
    "in addition to the optical spectra , jhkl photometry was taken of both stars on 2004 november 25 using the ir imager caspir on the 2.3 m telescope .",
    "they have since been monitored at k band at roughly two  four month intervals ( table 1 ) .",
    "evolved stars can generally be divided into oxygen - rich and carbon - rich groups , with oxygen - rich stars usually showing mid - ir silicate or alumina dust features , and carbon stars showing features from sic dust and pahs , and bands from c@xmath2h@xmath2 and other carbon - bearing molecules .",
    "in contrast , the mid - ir spectra of msx smc 014 and 155 are virtually featureless , offering few clues as to the chemistry of their dust , let alone their photospheres .",
    "we examined spectra from the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) and the photo - polarimeter on the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ , looking for similarly bland spectral energy distributions ( seds ) where f@xmath0 peaks @xmath179 , which led us to spectra in the 3.w class of @xcite .",

    "noted such variability in msx smc 155 and identified it as a candidate rcb star based on the 56 mag variation in eros 2 data ( exprience de recherche dobjets sombres ) .",
    "we confirmed the carbon - rich nature of the central star of msx smc 155 with visual spectroscopic observations , as figure [ fig.vis ] shows .",
    "our multi - epoch k - band data , shown in figure [ fig.var ] along with the 2mass k@xmath8 datum from 1998 , indicate that msx smc 155 is variable in the near - ir as well as the visible .",
    "the timescale and magnitude of the k - band variation in msx smc 155 ( one magnitude decline in 240 days ) is fairly typical of rcb stars @xcite as are the near - ir colors @xcite .",
    "thus , our visual and ir observations strongly support the candidacy of msx smc 155 as an rcb star .",
    "msx smc 014 does not appear in any of the databases produced by eros or other dark matter searches that target the magellanic clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , being outside their observed fields .",
    "due to its dimness , we were unable to confirm its carbon - rich nature with ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "we did detect k - band variability ( fig .",
    "[ fig.var ] ) , as with msx smc 155 .",
    "the recent variation is not as great as msx smc 155 showed ( 0.96 mag vs. 0.28 mag ) but there has been a @xmath10.7 mag increase in brightness since the 2mass observation in 1998 .",
    "it appears that both msx smc 155 and 014 were near maximum k brightness when observed by _",
    ", with msx smc 155 starting a fading event about 3060 days after the _ spitzer _  observation ( fig . [ fig.var ] ) .",
    "msx smc 014 was redder than the stars studied by @xcite but it is similar to the lmc rcb star hv 2379 during its faded period @xcite .",
    "given the similarity of the mid - ir spectrum of msx smc 014 to those of msx smc 155 and r crb , as well as the near - ir variability , we feel confident in identifying it as the sixth rcb candidate in the smc .",
    "it is also the first identified by its ir spectrum ( as opposed to visual variability ) and the first identified by _ spitzer_.",
    "the near - featurelessness of the spectra precludes a significant contribution from grains with strong spectral structure , such as graphite or silicates which dominate the mid - ir dust spectra of ordinary evolved stars .",
    "thus , we initially fit single temperature planck functions to the spectra , which are shown in figure [ fig.bbs ] .",
    "msx smc 014 can be fit with curves in the temperature range 580610 k , with the best fit at 590@xmath45 k. msx smc 155 is best fit with a 700@xmath45 k blackbody but could be as cool as 690 k. the residuals left after subtraction of the indicated blackbody from the irs data are less than 10% for most of the irs wavelength range ( fig .",
    "[ fig.bbs ] ) .",
    "dust temperatures for galactic rcb stars typically lie in the range 600900 k @xcite , so the single - component dust temperatures of the smc objects are comparable to the galactic population .    .",
    "the dotted line adds a small contribution from a 2500 k blackbody .",
    "the dashed line shows a similar shell+blackbody model but for a 2000 k star , and the black line is for a 3000 k star.,width=336 ]    amorphous carbon , relatively featureless in the mid - ir as noted above , is a likely carrier , so we obtained optical constants from @xcite and @xcitekwsuh / d - opt.htm and http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/@xmath1zubko/nk.html ] .",
    "although mostly featureless , the amorphous carbon seds are significantly narrower than the observed spectra , if the grains are assumed to be at a single temperature ( i.e. , at a single distance from the central star ) . a simple model , though , with a set of seds from amorphous carbon `` shells '' at varying distances from the central star can fit the irs data as well as the single - temperature blackbodies . ( note that the shells are simple representations of the irregular dust condensations that likely cause the visible obscuration and are not intended as actual physical entities . )",
    "the temperature range for the dust shells is about 5001100 k ( fig .",
    "[ fig.bblog ] ) .",
    "however , the irs data do little to constrain the stellar temperature since , for instance , a hotter star can be compensated for by placing the first shell at a greater distance from the star .    the near - ir data , though , do provide constraints on the stellar temperature and , to a lesser extent , the position of the inner shell , its visual opacity , and the number of shells .",
    "( complete modeling to explore the full parameter space is deferred to a future paper . ) for msx smc 014 , the k- and l - band points lie on the 590 k blackbody ( fig .",
    "1 ) or multi - shell amorphous carbon curves",
    ". the h - band point may be slightly above the curves which may indicate tentative detection of a photospheric contribution ( the j band is an upper limit in both the sso and 2mass data ) but by itself is insufficient to constrain the models .",
    "the near - ir data for msx smc 155 , though , lie well above the extrapolated mid - ir curves , so we do detect a photospheric contribution . for the amorphous carbon shells , a small contribution from stellar temperatures of @xmath120002500 k",
    "is supported by the near - ir data ; higher temperatures produce too much j - band flux but underestimate the k@xmath8 band flux . for the single - temperature dust model , slightly higher stellar temperatures",
    "fit although this is a less physically plausible model .",
    "figure [ fig.bblog ] shows typical results for the fitted models .",
    "the ranges in stellar temperature estimated for msx smc 155 are colder than even the unusually cool rcb star dy per ( @xmath13500 k , * ? ? ?",
    "comparison of the optical spectrum of msx smc 155 , particularly the 5635 band of c@xmath2 , with the catalog of c star spectra of @xcite and the @xmath9 values given for the catalog stars by @xcite suggests that @xmath9 for msx smc 155 is most likely @xmath130004000 k , although cooler values down to 2500 k can not be ruled out .",
    "the strong @xmath6 vibrational bandheads of c@xmath2 in msx smc 155 ( @xmath10 65266854  ) suggest that c@xmath2 has been excited to unusually high vibrational levels .",
    "these bandheads are weak or absent in typical c stars ( e.g. msx smc 134 in fig .",
    "[ fig.vis ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but were also strong in hv 2379 @xcite .",
    "finally , our visual spectrum is quite similar to those of the four lmc rcb stars of @xcite which have 40007000   spectra resembling dy per .",
    "we suggest that msx smc 155 , too , may be a cool , dy per - type rcb star .",
    "the distance to the smc is known ( 60 kpc or a distance modulus of 18.9 ) , so we can calculate the luminosities .",
    "we integrated under the single - temperature ( 590 k ) blackbody fit for msx smc 014 and a model of amorphous carbon shells plus a 2500 k blackbody ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig.bblog ] ) for msx smc 155 .",
    "these gave luminosities of l@xmath119700 l@xmath12 and l@xmath1111000 l@xmath12 of which roughly 70% and 40% emerge within the irs bandpass for msx smc 014 and 155 , respectively .",
    "given these luminosities and the cool photospheric temperatures suggested for the central stars , it appears that these objects may still be on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) but are undergoing the same type of episodic carbon shell ejections that are seen in warmer rcb stars .",
    "we observed two objects in the smc with largely featureless spectra in the mid - ir .",
    "these spectra are most similar to the sws data for r crb and other galactic rcb stars .",
    "msx smc 155 has been identified based on its optical variability as one of five rcb candidates in the smc .",
    "the second star , msx smc 014 , has no readily available visual photometry , but our k - band observations , along with the 2mass data , indicate it is a near - ir variable . based on the similarity of its irs spectrum to that of msx",
    "smc 155 , we identify msx smc 014 as the first rcb candidate found by its ir spectral properties rather than by optical variability , and also as the first rcb candidate discovered by _ spitzer_. the spectra can be fit by either a single - temperature blackbody or a set of amorphous carbon shells produced by different episodes of dust formation . calculated luminosities and estimated stellar temperatures imply that the central star for msx smc 155 may be a carbon star still on the agb .",
    "we suggest that it is the first dy per star , a rare type of very cool rcb star , identified in the smc .",
