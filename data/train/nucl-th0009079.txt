    "our starting point is that the key question in the physics of unstable nuclei is the knowledge of the @xmath0 for asymmetric nuclear matter away from normal conditions .",
    "we remark the effect of the symmetry term at low densities on the neutron skin structure , while the knowledge in high densities region is crucial for supernovae dynamics and neutron star cooling @xcite .",
    "effective interactions are obviously tuned to symmetry properties around normal conditions and any extrapolation can be quite dangerous .",
    "microscopic approaches based on realistic @xmath3 interactions , brueckner or variational schemes , or on effective field theories show a quite large variety of predictions , see fig.1 .    in the reaction dynamics with intermediate energy radioactive beams we can probe highly asymmetric nuclear matter in compressed as well as dilute phases : the aim of this paper is to show that fragmentation events have new features due to isospin effects and that some observables are particularly sensitive to the symmetry term of the @xmath0 .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * fig.1 - * @xmath0 for various effective forces , @xmath4 @xcite(dashed ) , @xmath5 @xcite(squares ) and @xmath6 @xcite(crosses ) .",
