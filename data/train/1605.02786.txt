    "psr j1741@xmath12054   in the ophiuchus constellation is one of the first @xmath0-ray pulsars to have been discovered by the large area telescope ( lat ; atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) aboard the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope through a blind search for pulsations ( abdo et al .  2009 ) .",
    "its spin period ( p@xmath8= 413 ms ) and its derivative ( @xmath9 s s@xmath10 ) yield a characteristic age @xmath11 myr .",
    "the spin parameters also yield a rotational energy loss rate @xmath12 erg s@xmath10 and a dipolar surface magnetic field @xmath13 g. soon after its @xmath0-ray detection , psr j1741@xmath12054  was also discovered as a radio pulsar in archival data from the parkes telescope .",
    "observations with the green bank telescope yielded a dispersion measure ( dm ) of 4.7 pc @xmath14 ( camilo et al .",
    "2009 ) which , from the ne2001 model of the galactic free electron density ( cordes & lazio 2002 ) , corresponds to a distance of @xmath15 0.38 kpc .",
    "its very faint radio flux ( @xmath16 mjy at 1.4 ghz ; camilo et al .",
    "2009 ) and small distance make psr j1741@xmath12054  the least luminous radio pulsar .",
    "psr j1741@xmath12054  is also one of the very few middle - aged ( @xmath171 myr ) @xmath0-ray pulsars closer than @xmath15 0.5 kpc ( see abdo et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the x - ray counterpart to psr j1741@xmath12054  was found by _ swift _",
    "( camilo et al .  2009 ) soon after its detection as a radio pulsar .",
    "the x - ray identification was confirmed by _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations that also detected a compact pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) around psr j1741@xmath12054  and an @xmath18-long trail of x - ray emission ( romani et al .",
    "the pulsar was also observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _  ( marelli et al .   2014 ) and x - ray pulsations were detected for the first time .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is characterised by the combination of a power - law ( pl ) and a black body ( bb ) , like in other middle - aged pulsars , produced by emission from the neutron star magnetosphere and the cooling neutron star surface .",
    "an analysis of the _ chandra _  data was done by karpova et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and auchettll et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , who also measured the pulsar proper motion ( @xmath19 mas yr@xmath10 ) from the analysis of multi - epoch observations .",
    "the proper motion corresponds to a transverse velocity of @xmath20 km s@xmath10 for a pulsar distance of 0.38 kpc .",
    "the close distance to psr j1741@xmath12054  makes it a promising target for a detection in the optical band .",
    "indeed , the middle - aged @xmath0-ray pulsars psr b0656 + 14 , geminga , and psr b1055@xmath152 have been all identified in the optical ( abdo et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) thanks to their distances , closer than @xmath21 kpc .",
    "observations of the psr j1741@xmath12054  field in the h@xmath22 band ( romani et al .  2010 ; brownsberger & romani 2014 ) allowed to discover a bow - shock nebula , produced by the pulsar motion in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , whose axis of symmetry is aligned with the major axis of the pwn trail and with the direction of the pulsar proper motion ( auchettl et al .",
    "the pulsar , however , remained undetected at optical wavelengths .",
    "interestingly , optical spectroscopy of the bow - shock nebula ( romani et al .",
    "2010 ) yielded a pulsar space velocity consistent with that inferred from its proper motion and the dm distance of 0.38 kpc , suggesting that this value is qualitatively correct .    here",
    ", we present the analysis of deep optical observations of psr j1741@xmath12054  carried out with the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "observations and data analysis are described in sectn .  2 , while the results are presented and discussed in sectn .  3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "psr j1741@xmath12054  was observed in service mode on may 14 and 15 , 2015 with the vlt at the eso paranal observatory and the second focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ( fors2 ; appenzeller et al .",
    "1998 ) in imaging mode . the camera was equipped with its default mit detector , a mosaic of two 4k@xmath232k ccds aligned along the long axis , optimised for wavelengths longer than 6000  . with the fors2 high - resolution collimator",
    ", the detector has a pixel scale of 0125 ( 2@xmath232 binning ) and a projected field  of  view ( fov ) of 4@xmath24 .",
    "the observations were executed with the standard low - gain and fast read - out mode and through the high - throughput @xmath25 ( @xmath26  ; @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29  ; @xmath30 ) filters . to allow for cosmic - ray removal and reduce the impact of bright star saturation , we obtained sequences of 30 short exposures ( 180 s ) for a total integration time of 5400 s in both the @xmath25 and @xmath28 filters .",
    "exposures were taken in dark time and under clear sky conditions , with the target close to the zenith ( airmass @xmath31 ) and seeing @xmath32 .",
    "we reduced the data ( bias subtraction and flat  fielding ) using tools in the iraf package ccdred . per each band , we aligned and average - stacked the reduced science images with the drizzle task in iraf , applying a @xmath33 clipping to filter out hot / cold pixels and cosmic ray hits .",
    "we applied the photometric calibration by using the fors2 night zero points and the atmospheric extinction coefficients .",
    "we computed the astrometry calibration using the _ wcstools _ suite of programs and reference stars from the gsc2.3 ( lasker et al .",
    "we obtained mean residuals of @xmath34 in the radial direction , using 30 non - saturated gsc2.3 stars selected to avoid the vignetted regions of the detector .",
    "thanks to the pixel scale of the fors2 images ( 0125 ) , the uncertainty on the centroids of the reference stars is negligible . to this value we added in quadrature the uncertainty of the image registration on the gsc-2.3 reference frame ( @xmath15 011 ) and the 015 uncertainty on the link of the gsc2.3 to the international celestial reference frame .",
    "we ended up with an overall accuracy of @xmath1502 on our absolute astrometry .",
    "as a reference to search for the psr j1741@xmath12054   optical counterpart , we used its _",
    "chandra _  coordinates @xmath35 ; @xmath36 ( mjd 55337 ) , with an estimated accuracy of 03 ( romani et al .",
    "we note that _ simbad _ currently reports the pulsar @xmath0-ray coordinates from the third _ fermi_-lat @xmath0-ray source catalogue ( acero et al .",
    "2015 ) , whereas those in the atnf pulsar data base ( manchester et al .",
    "2005 ) are inconsistent with the published ones ( camilo et al .  2009 ; romani et al .",
    "we accounted for the _ chandra _  proper motion is reported with the wrong sign at page 70 of auchettll et al .  (",
    "@xmath37 mas yr@xmath10 and @xmath38 mas yr@xmath10 ( auchettl et al .",
    "2015 ) to extrapolate the pulsar coordinates at the epoch of our vlt observations ( mjd 57156 ) .",
    "the error on the proper motion produces an uncertainty on the coordinate extrapolation ( @xmath39 ) negligible compared to that of the reference _ chandra _  coordinates and the accuracy of our astrometry calibration .",
    "a close - up of the fors2 b@xmath40-band image centred on the extrapolated psr j1741@xmath12054  position is shown in fig .",
    "[ fc ] ( left ) .",
    "an object is clearly detected within the position error circle , of magnitudes @xmath41 and @xmath2 .",
    "a second , fainter object ( @xmath42 and @xmath3 ) is visible south of it within @xmath43 from the expected pulsar position . to minimise the effects of the bright stars north of the pulsar position , we computed the objects magnitudes through psf photometry with the daophot ii package ( stetson 1994 ) in iraf and applied the aperture correction . owing to its position close to the galactic plane ( @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ) ,",
    "the field of psr j1741@xmath12054  is very crowded .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out the possibility of a chance coincidence with the proper motion - corrected _ chandra _  position . assuming a poisson distribution , the probability of a having at least a spurious association within a given matching radius is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the association radius and @xmath49 is the number density of field objects of brightness between that of the two objects and the image detection limit . for @xmath50 arcsec@xmath7 ,",
    "as measured by the number of objects counted in the fors2 images , and @xmath51 , chosen as the angular separation between the centre of the error circle and the southernmost of the two objects , we derived that @xmath52 .",
    "if psr j1741@xmath12054  had an optical luminosity of the same order of magnitude as psr b0656 + 14 , geminga , and psr b1055@xmath152 , which are at a similar distance , we would expect that its optical brightness be in the range @xmath5326 .",
    "this would make the faintest of the two objects above a more likely candidate counterpart to the pulsar . without further evidence , we can not firmly rule out the other object as a candidate counterpart , though . in this case , however , psr j1741@xmath12054  would be about ten times brighter than the other three middle - aged pulsars , unless its distance is overestimated by a factor of three . such a small distance would be incompatible with the significant hydrogen column density @xmath54 in the pulsar direction ( marelli et al .",
    "2014 ) and with the measurements of the pulsar space velocity ( romani et al .  2010 ; auchettl et al .  2015 ) , which are in agreement with the dm - based distance .",
    "further observations will solve this possible ambiguity , e.g. by measuring for the candidate counterpart the same proper motion as the pulsar , which would secure its identification .",
    "[ fc ] ( right ) shows a zoom out of the fors2 image around the psr j1741@xmath12054  position .",
    "a region of extended emission with an arc - like structure is clearly visible around the pulsar , with a spatial extent and morphology very similar to those of the bow - shock nebula detected in h@xmath22 by romani et al .",
    "the arc - like structure in fig . [ fc ] is not seen in the v@xmath40-band image .",
    "we identify this structure with the bow - shock nebula around the pulsar and attribute its origin to the contribution of the h@xmath55 and h@xmath56 emission lines in the bow - shock spectrum ( romani et al .",
    "the wavelengths of these lines fall within the band width of the b@xmath40 filter but not of the v@xmath40 one ( see sectn .",
    "2 ) , which explains the non - detection of the structure in the latter filter .",
    "we compared both the position and morphology of the bow - shock nebula with those observed in images taken back on august 21 2009 ( mjd=55063 ) by romani et al .",
    "( 2010 ) with the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) .",
    "the data set , retrieved from the public eso archive , includes three exposure in h@xmath22 ( 600 s each ) taken with the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc ; buzzoni et al .  1984 ) , with a spatial resolution of 025/pixel .",
    "we reduced the data and applied the astrometry calibration as described in sectn .  2 .",
    "2 ( left ) shows the ntt image with the contours of the vlt / fors2 image overlaid .",
    "although the morphology of the bow - shock nebula is consistent in the two images , its position in the vlt one is slightly offset to the southwest , i.e. close to the direction of the pulsar proper motion ( position angle @xmath57 , measured east of north ) .",
    "we measured this displacement by comparing the relative positions of the peaks of the nebula surface brightness measured in rectangle of 35@xmath2316 around its axis of symmetry and found that it amounts to @xmath58 arcsec . the time span between the vlt and ntt images ( @xmath15 5.7 years ) implies an annual nebula displacement of @xmath59 mas yr@xmath10 , consistent with the pulsar proper motion ( @xmath60 mas yr@xmath10 )",
    "therefore , the nebula displacement is explained by the shock propagation in the ism , as a result of the pulsar proper motion .",
    "we also note that for the northern rim of the nebula there is a hint of a larger displacement than for the southern one .",
    "this suggests a different propagation velocity of the shock along the north - south direction , probably due to a difference in the local density of the ism .",
    "psr j1741@xmath12054 is , thus , the third pulsar only for which a displacement of the @xmath61 bow - shock nebula has been detected after psr b2224 + 65 with its renown `` guitar '' nebula ( chatterjee & cordes 2002 ) , and psr j0437@xmath14715 ( e.g. , brownsberger et al .",
    "2015 ) .    on a much larger scale",
    ", we found no evidence of diffuse optical emission which can be associated with the x - ray pwn ( fig.[pwn ] , right ) . from our broad - band images , which cover the entire pwn area",
    ", we estimated @xmath5 upper limits of @xmath62 and @xmath6 magnitudes arcsec@xmath7 on its optical surface brightness in the b@xmath40 and v@xmath40 bands , respectively .",
    "these limits have been computed by averaging measurements obtained in a grid of star - free regions along the pwn .",
    "owing to their faintness , only eight of the over 200 @xmath0-ray pulsars discovered to date have been detected at optical wavelengths ( see abdo et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) , the number accounting also for psr b0540@xmath169 ( caraveo et al .",
    "1992 ) , only recently found to be a @xmath0-ray pulsar ( ackermann et al .",
    "furthermore , candidate counterparts have been found for psr j0205 + 6449 ( moran et al .",
    "2013 ) and    psr j1357@xmath16429 ( zyuzin et al .  2016 ) . here",
    ", we found a candidate counterpart to another @xmath0-ray pulsar , psr j1741@xmath12054 .",
    "we compared its fluxes with the extrapolation in the optical regime of the pulsar x and @xmath0-ray spectra .",
    "fermi_-lat spectrum is described by a pl with photon index @xmath63 and an exponential cut - off at energy @xmath64 gev , yielding a flux @xmath65 erg cm@xmath7 s@xmath10 ( acero et al .",
    "the joint _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  spectrum ( marelli et al .",
    "2014 ) is described by a combination of a pl with photon index @xmath67 and a bb of temperature @xmath68 kev , with a corresponding emitting area of radius @xmath69 km for a pulsar distance of 0.38 kpc .",
    "the spectral fit yields an @xmath70 cm@xmath7 and unabsorbed fluxes of @xmath71 and @xmath72 erg cm@xmath7 s@xmath10 for the pl and bb components , respectively .",
    "similar spectral parameters were obtained by fitting the _",
    "chandra _  data alone with the same spectral model ( karpova et al .  2014 ; auchettl et al .",
    "we computed the interstellar reddening along the line of sight , @xmath73 , from the @xmath54 and the relation of predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) .",
    "then , we computed the unabsorbed spectral fluxes of the pulsar candidate counterpart in the b@xmath40 and v@xmath40 bands applying the interstellar extinction coefficients of fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) .",
    "the b@xmath40 and v@xmath40-band optical fluxes lie well below the extrapolation of the x - ray pl , and above that of the @xmath0-ray pl ( fig.[sed ] ) , suggesting that the non - thermal x - ray spectrum breaks at low energies . single / multiple breaks in the multi - wavelength spectrum are observed in @xmath0-ray pulsars , without an obvious relation to their characteristics , e.g. age and magnetic field ( mignani et al .",
    "2016 ) . more likely , they are related to different geometries of the emission regions in the pulsar magnetosphere and different viewing angles , which produce different light curve profiles . in the case of psr j1741@xmath12054 , the break between the x and @xmath0-ray pls indeed comes with a difference in the x/@xmath0-ray light curves ( marelli et al .",
    "2014 ) .    like in the x - rays",
    ", we expect that the optical emission of psr j1741@xmath12054  results from both the non - thermal emission from the neutron star magnetosphere and the thermal emission from the cooling neutron star surface as observed in other middle - aged pulsars , i.e. psr b0656 + 14 , geminga ( kargaltsev & pavlov 2007 ) , and psr b1055@xmath152 ( mignani et al .",
    "indeed , the optical fluxes are above the extrapolation of the bb component to the x - ray spectrum and are not consistent with a rayleigh - jeans spectrum .",
    "this implies both that any thermal component to the optical spectrum must be produced from a region on the neutron star surface presumably larger and colder than that producing the x - ray emission and that a non - thermal pl component must be present .",
    "obviously , with only two flux measurements it is impossible to decouple these two components .",
    "multi - band follow - up observations are required for a spectral characterisation .",
    "the unabsorbed flux of the candidate counterpart is @xmath74 erg cm@xmath7 s@xmath10 , integrated over the v@xmath40 band .",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity @xmath75 erg s@xmath10 for a distance of 0.38 kpc .",
    "the ratio to the pulsar rotational energy loss rate yields an optical emission efficiency @xmath76 .",
    "we also compared the unabsorbed optical flux with the unabsorbed , total x - ray flux @xmath77 and the @xmath0-ray flux @xmath78 .",
    "this yields @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "all these values are in the range of those computed for the other middle - aged pulsars identified in the optical ( see , e.g. tab .  4 of moran et al .",
    "this confirms that middle - aged pulsars tend to have similar multi - wavelength emission properties .",
    "the better spatial resolution and sensitivity of our fors2 images with respect to those of romani et al .",
    "( 2010 ) make it possible to better resolve the morphology of the bow - shock nebula ( fig .",
    "2 , left ) .",
    "romani et al .",
    "( 2010 ) noted that its shape is remarkably different with respect to the expectations of the model by wilkin ( 1996 ) , which assumes an isotropic pulsar wind .",
    "these authors computed the ratio of the perpendicular half - angular size of the nebula @xmath81 ( measured through the pulsar ) to the separation @xmath82 between the pulsar and the apex of the nebula as a measure of the `` flatness '' of the bow - shock front and showed that the observed value can be reproduced by a model assuming an equatorially - concentrated pulsar wind , aligned pulsar spin axis and space velocity , and edge - on viewing geometry .",
    "our images allow us to better constrain the distance of the bow - shock apex from the pulsar . similarly to what we did in sectn .",
    "3 , we extracted the nebula surface brightness profile along an image strip of 0625 width , aligned with the pulsar proper motion direction ( auchettl et al .",
    "2015 ) , and we measured its position by fitting a simple gaussian function . the resulting angular separation with respect to the proper",
    "motion - corrected _ chandra _  position of the pulsar ( mjd 57156 ) , @xmath83 , is consistent with the value of @xmath84 estimated by romani et al .",
    "( 2010 ) using the original _ chandra _ position ( mjd 55337 ) and the ntt h@xmath22 image ( mjd 55063 ) .",
    "a refined measurement of the pulsar proper motion , together with a more accurate pulsar localisation from the identification of its optical counterpart , will allow us to probe in more detail the geometry of the momentum deposition by the pulsar particle wind .",
    "the x - ray pwn is characterised by a segmented structure ( fig .",
    "[ pwn ] , right ) , with three bright emission lobes , one centred on the pulsar , and the other two almost aligned along the pwn tail , at @xmath85 and @xmath86 from the pulsar .",
    "the fors2 images show that these two lobes can not be produced by the combined emission of bright back / foreground stars but must be intrinsic to the pwn . in case of a classical x - ray synchrotron emission ,",
    "a variation of the mean interstellar density would cause the formation of such lobes , although this would imply a variation of a factor @xmath1510 on a @xmath150.01 pc scale ( for a 0.38 kpc distance ) .",
    "alternatively , a spatial - dependent particle re - acceleration mechanism could be at work , as already invoked for other peculiar pwne around , e.g. psr j2055 + 2539 ( marelli et al .  2016 ) and psr j1509@xmath15850 ( klingler et al .  2016 ) , or a different emission mechanism could be responsible for powering the x - ray pwn , like , e.g. in psr j0357 + 3205 ( marelli et al .  2013 ) .",
    "using the vlt , we found a possible candidate optical counterpart to psr j1741@xmath12054   ( @xmath87 ) based upon positional coincidence with its proper motion - corrected _ chandra _   coordinates .",
    "psr j1741@xmath12054  would , then , be the third @xmath0-ray pulsar discovered by _",
    "fermi _ for which a candidate optical / infrared counterpart has been found , after psr j0205 + 6449 ( moran et al .",
    "2013 ) and psr j1357@xmath16429 ( zyuzin et al .",
    "multi - epoch optical observations will allow us to measure the proper motion of the psr j1741@xmath12054  candidate counterpart and confirm the optical identification , whereas multi - band photometry will be needed to determine the pulsar spectrum in the optical .",
    "in the same vlt data , we also detected the bow - shock nebula around the pulsar and found that it is displaced to the southwest with respect to its position measured in the 2009 ntt data of romani et al .",
    "the annual displacement ( @xmath59 mas yr@xmath10 ) is compatible with that expected for the pulsar proper motion , showing that the shock propagates in the ism as the pulsar moves through it .",
    "finally , we looked for extended optical emission associated with the x - ray pwn but we could not detect it down to a limit of @xmath6 magnitudes arcsec@xmath7 in the @xmath28 band , the deepest obtained so far for this nebula .",
