    "closeness measures such as resistance distance may be undesirable@xcite , because the addition of a new edge in the network should be detrimental to some nodes ( those who receive less of the finite resource due to the new edge ) and beneficial to others ( those who receive more due to the edge ) . for closeness measures based on the direct weight between nodes ( where the ` closeness ' between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is often taken to be @xmath16 ) or resistance distance between nodes , it is straightforward to see that the newly measured closeness between nodes @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath17 for all pairs , i.e. the addition of an edge can never cause nodes to feel less close to one another .",
