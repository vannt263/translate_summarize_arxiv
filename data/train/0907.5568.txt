    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is one of the favoured ideas for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) that may soon be explored at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in a recent paper  @xcite , we presented some results from frequentist analyses of the parameter spaces of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( cmssm )  in which the soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar and gaugino masses are each constrained to universal values @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively @xcite  and the nuhm1  in which the soft supersymmetry - breaking contributions to the higgs masses are allowed a different but common value @xcite .",
    "other statistical analyses in these models can be found in  @xcite and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analyses in @xcite .",
    "for comparison , see also  @xcite for recent analyses in the next - to - minimal extension of the sm , as well as  @xcite for other analyses in supersymmetric models without a dedicated fit .",
    "the results presented in  @xcite included the parameters of the best - fit points in the cmssm and the nuhm1 , as well as the 68 and 95%  c.l .",
    "regions found with default implementations of the phenomenological , experimental and cosmological constraints .",
    "these include precision electroweak data , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath0 , @xmath1-physics observables ( the rates for br(@xmath3 )  and br(@xmath13 ) , @xmath14 mixing , and the upper limit on br(@xmath4 ) ) , the bound on the lightest mssm higgs boson mass , @xmath10 , and the cold dark matter ( cdm ) density inferred from astrophysical and cosmological data  , which is subject to astrophysical and hadronic uncertainties , as discussed below .",
    "] , assuming that this is dominated by the relic density of the lightest neutralino , @xmath15 .",
    "we also discussed in  @xcite the sensitivities of the areas of the preferred regions to changes in the ways in which the major constraints are implemented .",
    "we found that the smallest sensitivity was to the cdm density , and the greatest sensitivity was that to @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the frequentist approach from  @xcite , which is different from the bayesian approach adopted in @xcite .",
    "a key issue in a bayesian approach is the appropriate choice of priors . as discussed in some recent bayesian analyses of the cmssm  @xcite , conclusions for preferred regions of parameter space can depend the choice of priors . in our view , the results of a bayesian approach should not be considered definitive unless they are shown to be sufficiently independent of plausible variations in the choice of priors . in our frequentist analysis , we use the mcmc technique to sample efficiently the cmssm and nuhm1 parameter spaces , and we generate sufficiently many chains to sample adequately these parameter spaces , as discussed in more detail in section  2 of this paper .    our treatments of the experimental constraints from electroweak precision observables , @xmath1-physics observables and cosmological data are , in general , very similar to those in  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we do not discuss details in this paper , contenting ourselves with a brief recapitulation and update .",
    "in section  3 we extend the presentation of results from our mcmc frequentist analysis to include the global @xmath2 likelihood functions for various observables , including @xmath10 , br(@xmath3 ) , br(@xmath4 )  and the spin - independent dm scattering cross section , @xmath5 , as well as sparticle masses .",
    "we also discuss the correlations between pairs of these observables , and compare the results in the cmssm and nuhm1 .",
    "we pay particular attention to the prospects for detecting susy in forthcoming experiments , including searches at the lhc and the ilc as well as @xmath1 physics and direct searches for cdm .",
    "we present an update on the prediction of @xmath10 in the cmssm  @xcite and the first prediction for @xmath10 in the nuhm1 . for these analyses",
    "the experimental constraints on @xmath10 itself have been left out of the fit .",
    "the result in the cmssm of @xcite is confirmed with a best - fit value slightly below the lep bound . within the nuhm1 ,",
    "however , a value _ above _ the lep bounds arises naturally . for other observables ,",
    "however , the @xmath10 information _ is _ included in calculating the @xmath2 likelihood functions .",
    "the likelihood functions for generic sparticle masses are skewed , being cut off at low masses by the lep lower limit on @xmath10 , in particular . on the other hand",
    "the likelihood functions rise more gradually for large masses , with the largest contribution arising from @xmath0 .",
    "we see that the role of the @xmath10 constraint is smaller in the nuhm1 than in the cmssm , reflecting the fact that the other constraints suggest , in the nuhm1 , a value of @xmath10 somewhat larger than the lep lower limit .",
    "as remarked in  @xcite , the preferred values of the sparticle masses are generally somewhat lower in the nuhm1 than in the cmssm .",
    "this is because the extra degree of freedom in the higgs sector allows lower values of @xmath12 to be reconciled with upper limits on deviations from the sm and the lep lower limit on @xmath10 .",
    "recall that in the cmssm , the higgs mass mixing parameter , @xmath16 , and the higgs pseudoscalar mass , @xmath17 , are fixed by the minimization of the higgs potential ensuring electroweak symmetry breaking when @xmath18 is chosen as an input parameter .",
    "in contrast , in the nuhm1 , either @xmath16 _ or _",
    "@xmath17 can be chosen as an additional input parameter , or @xmath17 as an input is equivalent to a choice of the soft higgs mass @xmath19 at the gut scale . ] thus allowing substantial additional freedom in the light higgs scalar mass for a given set of cmssm parameters ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the greater freedom in the higgs sector also results in different mass ranges being favoured for the heavier higgs bosons @xmath21 and for the heavier neutralinos , as observed in  @xcite .",
    "we find here that sparticle masses are mostly highly correlated .",
    "this could be expected for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are both determined essentially uniquely by @xmath12 .",
    "however , the correlation is only slightly weakened for the slepton and squark masses , including @xmath24 .",
    "this is partly because the largest contributions to the preferred values of most of these particles are due to @xmath12 , rather than to @xmath11 .",
    "this tendency is reinforced by the fact that our likelihood analysis finds that the coannihilation regions are favoured in both the cmssm and the nuhm1 .",
    "however , this preference is slightly weakened in the nuhm1 , where direct - channel annihilation through the heavy higgs ( @xmath25 ) poles may also play a subsidiary role , and larger values of @xmath11 become possible . in particular",
    ", the correlation between @xmath26 and @xmath23 is particularly weak in the nuhm1 , reflecting the appearance of preferred regions of the parameters away from the coannihilation strip . in general , there are good prospects for discovering susy in early lhc running , in both the cmssm and the nuhm1 .",
    "we find that br(@xmath4 )  is expected to be close to its sm value in the cmssm , because of the strong preference for relatively low @xmath18 where the supersymmetric contributions to this channel are small",
    ". they may be much larger in the nuhm1 because of the freedom to choose @xmath17 below its nominal cmssm value .",
    "spin - independent scattering of supersymmetric dark matter may well be observable in planned experiments in both the cmssm and the nuhm1 , where a somewhat larger range for @xmath5 is preferred in the nuhm1 @xcite .    however , these optimistic conclusions rely critically on the implementation of the @xmath0  constraint using low - energy @xmath27 data , as used in our analysis , and we discuss in section [ sec : dropgmt ] the implications of removing the @xmath0  constraint . we also discuss the predictions of our fits for br(@xmath3 ) , @xmath9  and @xmath10 , presenting the likelihood functions for each of these observables without their own contributions .",
    "none of these observables exhibits any significant tension with the others .",
    "we define a global @xmath2 likelihood function , which combines all theoretical predictions with experimental constraints : @xmath28 & + { \\chi^2({m_h } ) + \\chi^2({{\\rm br}}(b_s \\to \\mu\\mu ) ) } \\nonumber \\\\[.2em ] & + { \\chi^2(\\mbox{susy search limits } ) } \\nonumber \\\\[.2em ] & + \\sum^m_i \\frac{(f^{\\rm obs}_{{\\rm sm}_i }                - f^{\\rm fit}_{{\\rm sm}_i})^2}{\\sigma(f_{{\\rm sm}_i})^2 } \\label{eqn : chi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath29 is the number of observables studied , @xmath30 represents an experimentally measured value ( constraint ) and each @xmath31 defines a prediction for the corresponding constraint that depends on the supersymmetric parameters . the experimental uncertainty , @xmath32 , of each measurement is taken to be both statistically and systematically independent of the corresponding theoretical uncertainty , @xmath33 , in its prediction .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 and @xmath35 the @xmath2 contributions from the two measurements for which only one - sided bounds are available so far , as discussed below .",
    "furthermore we include the lower limits from the direct searches for susy particles at lep  @xcite as one - sided limits , denoted by `` @xmath36 '' in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) .",
    "we stress that , as in  @xcite , the three standard model parameters @xmath37 are included as fit parameters and allowed to vary with their current experimental resolutions @xmath38 .",
    "we do not include @xmath39 as a fit parameter , which would have only a minor impact on the analysis .    formulating the fit in this fashion",
    "has the advantage that the @xmath2 probability , @xmath40 , properly accounts for the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath41 , in the fit and thus represents a quantitative and meaningful measure for the `` goodness - of - fit . '' in previous studies @xcite , @xmath40 has been verified to have a flat distribution , thus yielding a reliable estimate of the confidence level for any particular point in parameter space .",
    "further , an important aspect of the formulation is that all model parameters are varied simultaneously in the mcmc sampling , and care is exercised to fully explore the multi - dimensional space , including possible interdependencies between parameters .",
    "all confidence levels for selected model parameters are performed by scanning over the desired parameters while minimizing the @xmath2 function with respect to all other model parameters .",
    "that is , in order to determine the function @xmath42 for some model parameter @xmath43 , all the remaining free parameters are set to values corresponding to a new @xmath2 minimum determined for fixed @xmath43 .",
    "the function values where @xmath42 is found to be equal to @xmath44 determine the confidence level contour . for two - dimensional parameter scans we use @xmath45 to determine the 68%(95% ) confidence level contours .",
    "only experimental constraints are imposed when deriving confidence level contours , without any arbitrary or direct constraints placed on model parameters themselves . to values below @xmath46 .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec : summary ] below , we furthermore impose a cut on parameter regions where the higher - order corrections relating the running mass to the on - shell mass of the pseudo - scalar higgs boson get unacceptably large . ]",
    "this leads to robust and statistically meaningful estimates of the total 68% and 95% confidence levels , which may be composed of multiple separated contours .",
    "finally , the sensitivity of the global fit to different constraint scenarios can be studied by removing one of the experimental constraints or by rescaling one of the experimental uncertainties , as discussed in sect .  3 in @xcite .",
    "studies of such scenarios are particularly helpful in identifying which experimental data are most useful in constraining the theoretical model and hence in precisely studying how hyper - volumes in parameter space become more tightly constrained ( either now or in the future ) .    since each new scenario in which a parameter is removed or an uncertainty re - scaled represents , fundamentally , a new @xmath2 function which must be minimized , multiple re - samplings of the full multi - dimensional parameter space are , in principle , required to determine the most probable fit regions for each scenario",
    ". however , these would be computationally too expensive . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we exploit the fact that independent @xmath2 functions are additive and result in a well defined @xmath2 probability .",
    "hence , we define `` loose '' @xmath2 functions , @xmath47 , in which the term representing some constraint , e.g. , @xmath48 , is removed from the global @xmath2 function .",
    "the @xmath47 function represents the likelihood that a particular set of model parameter values is compatible with a sub - set of the experimental data constraints , without any experimental knowledge of the removed constraint .    an exhaustive , and computationally expensive , 25 million point pre - sampling of the @xmath47 function",
    "is then performed in the full multi - dimensional model parameter space using a mcmc .",
    "constraint terms representing the various experimental scenarios are then re - instated or removed to form different @xmath2 functions , one for each scenario studied .",
    "if the scenario requires an additional constraint to be removed from the @xmath47 function , the density of points pre - sampled for the @xmath47 function was carefully tested and verified to also be an unbiased and sufficiently complete sampling of the studied model parameter space for the full @xmath2 function by using dedicated mcmc samples of approximately one million sampling points each , where the particular constraint in question was removed .",
    "specifically , we use this technique to study the effects of removing individually the @xmath0 , br(@xmath3 ) , @xmath9  and @xmath10 constraints .",
    "the precise values of the most probable fit parameters are determined via a full minuit minimization of the @xmath2 for each different scenario , but are performed only within the general parameter space regions not already excluded from the pre - sampling of the @xmath47 function .",
    "an mcmc final sampling is subsequently used to determine the 68% and 95% confidence - level contours for each constraint scenario studied  .",
    "for example , in  @xcite we showed that the effect of dropping the @xmath48 experimental data from the fit is not very important in constraining the allowed regions in the @xmath49 and @xmath50  planes .",
    "the reason for this can be understood by recalling that the wmap strips in the cmssm @xmath51 planes found for different , but _ fixed _",
    ", values of @xmath52 move around as this and other cmssm parameters are varied .",
    "indeed , for fixed @xmath53 , the strips can be shown to nearly foliate the @xmath49 plane  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath18 is only weakly constrained by the experimental data but gets correlated through the fit to the other parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath53 ) , the effect of the @xmath48 constraint is to reduce the dimensionality of the allowed parameter - space to a certain `` hyper - sheet '' which , when viewed by fixing @xmath18 to a particular value ( i.e.  slicing the sheet along the @xmath18-axis ) , reduces to the observed strips in the @xmath49 planes .",
    "however , since this sheet is generally embedded in the full parameter space hyper - volume and is not diagonalized along some particular parameter axis , a large range of values for @xmath54 remain statistically probable when considering the global fit and , from a strict statistical consideration , there are no strips of preferred regions .",
    "when we apply here a similar analysis to the @xmath0  constraint , we find a very different picture .",
    "we exhibited already in  @xcite the effect of relaxing this constraint by some fraction , showing that the preferred areas of the @xmath49 and @xmath50  planes changed substantially .",
    "here we illustrate the effect of removing the @xmath0  constraint entirely , which relaxes very considerably the upper limits on sparticle masses .",
    "however , the other observables still disfavour very large values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 by @xmath55 , as we discuss below .",
    "the experimental constraints used in our analyses are listed in table  [ tab : constraints ] .",
    "the notations for the observables are standard , and were defined in  @xcite .",
    "their values generally have only minor updates from the values quoted there , but one important comment concerns our implementation of the lep constraint on @xmath10 .",
    "the value quoted in the table was derived within the sm , and is applicable to the cmssm , in which the relevant higgs couplings are very similar to those in the sm  @xcite , so that the sm exclusion results can be used , supplemented with an additional theoretical uncertainty whose implementation we now describe .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in our previous paper  @xcite we discussed , in addition to the spectra at the best - fit points in the cmssm and nuhm1 , the regions of the @xmath56 planes preferred in these scenarios at the 68 and 95% c.l . here",
    "we complement those discussions by providing directly the likelihood functions for certain sparticle masses , noting in particular the impacts of the most relevant constraints , the difference between the total @xmath2 function and its value at the minimum for the relevant model . ] .",

    "the solid line shows the result obtained when incorporating the lep higgs limit , while the dashed line corresponds to the case where the lep higgs constraint is removed .",
    "there is a sharp rise in the likelihood function at low values of @xmath22 , which is caused by the limits from the direct searches for susy particles , but receives also contributions from br(@xmath3 )  and other constraints .",

    "[ fig : mchi ] displays the likelihood function in the nuhm1 with the lep higgs constraint removed . here",
    "we see very little difference from the result for the nuhm1 with the lep constraint imposed . this reflects the fact that in the nuhm1 ( unlike the cmssm ) the other constraints do not push @xmath10 down to quite low values , a point made explicit in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh ] below .",

    "[ fig : mh ] , the best - fit value of @xmath10 indicated by the other constraints is significantly higher than the sm lep lower limit . as a consequence , incorporating the lep constraint ( see above for details ) , shown as the solid line , does not alter significantly the best - fit value of @xmath10 . as a corollary ,",
    "the differences between the likelihood functions of the nuhm1 for other masses and observables between the fits with and without the lep @xmath10 constraint are less significant than for the cmssm . in the rest of this paper ( except in section  [ sec : dropmh ] ) we show results with the lep @xmath10 constraint imposed .",

    "we start our discussion with the gluino mass , @xmath23 . in both the cmssm and the nuhm1 , the best - fit points have relatively low values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "these favoured values are well within the range even of the early operations of the lhc with reduced centre - of - mass energy and limited luminosity .",
    "however , the effect of the gradual increase in @xmath2 as @xmath12 increases , due essentially to @xmath0  as commented before , means that even quite large values of @xmath59 are allowed at the 3-@xmath6 ( @xmath60 ) level ( not shown in fig .",

    "the difference between the gluino and the squark masses is sensitive primarily to @xmath11 .",
    "since the preferred regions of the parameter space in both the cmssm and the nuhm1 are in the @xmath65-slepton coannihilation region where @xmath66 , @xmath11 makes only small contributions to the central values of the squark masses  .",

    "as we discuss below , the favoured range of values of @xmath16 is quite circumscribed in the cmssm , whereas a larger variation in @xmath16 is possible in the nuhm1 .",

    "as noted in  @xcite , the particle spectra are similar in the two models , the most prominent differences being in the masses of the heavier higgs bosons @xmath25 and @xmath138 , which are lighter in the nuhm1 , and the heavier neutralinos and chargino , which are lighter in the cmssm .",
    "these differences reflect the greater freedom in varying the parameters of the higgs sector in the nuhm1 .",
    "the favoured values of the particle masses in both models are such that there are good prospects for detecting supersymmetric particles even in the early phase of the lhc running with reduced centre - of - mass energy and limited luminosity and for observing supersymmetric particles and possibly the whole higgs boson spectrum at a 1  tev @xmath133 collider ( the latter refers in particular to the case of the nuhm1 ) .",
    "we find striking correlations between the different sparticle masses in both the cmssm and the nuhm1 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the dominant contributions to most of the sfermion masses are those due to @xmath12 , implying that most sparticle masses are tightly correlated with those of the gluino and the lsp .",
    "these correlations imply that , if the gluino is discovered at the lhc and its mass determined by a combination of kinematic and cross - section measurements , the predictions for the other sparticle masses within the cmssm and the nuhm1 could be refined considerably . in particular , the masses for colour - neutral sparticles such as the neutralino lsp and sleptons could be estimated more accurately , and hence also the energies of the corresponding thresholds in @xmath27 annihilation within these models . for some of the correlations , most notably the difference between the lsp mass and the mass of the lighter stau ,",
    "the pattern of the fit results in the nuhm1 drastically differs from the one in the cmssm .",

    "we find in both the cmssm and the nuhm1 that the favoured rate for spin - independent dark matter scattering lies quite close to the present experimental upper limit , though with larger uncertainties in the nuhm1 . in view of the prospective improvements in the sensitivities of direct dark matter search experiments in the near future",
    ", they may be able to actually find the first indication of a supersymmetric particle before the lhc , though a combination of astrophysical and collider measurements would be needed to pin down its susy nature .",

    "this plays the dominant role in disfavouring large values of @xmath12 and @xmath11 and hence , in particular , the focus - point region of the cmssm .",
    "in particular , br(@xmath3 )  plays no role in disfavouring the focus - point region .",

    "the net result is that the focus - point region is disfavoured by @xmath55 , even if the @xmath0constraint is dropped .",
    "conversely , the other data provide a hint that the supersymmetric contribution to @xmath0  might be of comparable magnitude to the range required to reconcile the experimental measurement of @xmath0  with the sm calculation .",
    "we have also explored the effect of dropping from the global fit the experimental measurement of br(@xmath3 ) , and have shown that there is no conflict between this observable and the other constraints .",

    "finally , we have discussed the impact of dropping the lep higgs constraint from the global fits . while in the cmssm",
    "there is a slight tension between the fit result and the direct search limit , similarly to the sm case , the nuhm1 actually _ favours _ a value for @xmath10 significantly above the lep limit . the discovery at the lhc of a higgs boson weighing more than 120  gev would favour the nuhm1 over the cmssm",

    "<S> on the basis of frequentist analyses of experimental constraints from electroweak precision data , @xmath0 , @xmath1 physics and cosmological data , we investigate the parameters of the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) with universal soft supersymmetry - breaking mass parameters , and a model with common non - universal higgs masses ( nuhm1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present @xmath2 likelihood functions for the masses of supersymmetric particles and higgs bosons , as well as br(@xmath3 ) , br(@xmath4 )  and the spin - independent dark matter scattering cross section , @xmath5 . in the cmssm </S>",
    "<S> we find preferences for sparticle masses that are relatively light . in the nuhm1 </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit values for many sparticle masses are even slightly smaller , but with greater uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the likelihood functions for most sparticle masses are cut off sharply at small masses , in particular by the lep higgs mass constraint . </S>",
    "<S> both in the cmssm and the nuhm1 , the coannihilation region is favoured over the focus - point region at about the 3-@xmath6 level , largely but not exclusively because of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> many sparticle masses are highly correlated in both the cmssm and nuhm1 , and most of the regions preferred at the 95% c.l .  </S>",
    "<S> are accessible to early lhc running , though high - luminosity running would be needed to cover the regions allowed at the 3-@xmath6 levels . </S>",
    "<S> some slepton and chargino / neutralino masses should be in reach at the ilc . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of the heavier higgs bosons should be accessible at the lhc and the ilc in portions of the preferred regions in the @xmath7 plane . in the cmssm , the likelihood function for br(@xmath4 )  </S>",
    "<S> is peaked close to the standard model value , but much larger values are possible in the nuhm1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that values of @xmath8  pb are preferred in both the cmssm and the nuhm1 . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effects of dropping the @xmath0 , br(@xmath3 ) , @xmath9  and @xmath10 constraints , demonstrating that they are not in tension with the other constraints .    </S>",
