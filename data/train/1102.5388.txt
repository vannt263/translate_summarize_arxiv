    "recently , there has been much interest on two - way relay networks ( twrns ) in which two source nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 without a direct link communicate with each other via a relay node .",
    "the architecture of twrns makes it possible to better exploit the channel multiplexing of uplink and downlink wireless medium @xcite .",
    "the source nodes initially send their data to the relay node .",
    "the received data is combined employing a certain method according to the amplify - and - forward ( af ) or the decode - and - forward ( df ) mode and gets broadcasted from the relay back to both source nodes . with the application of network coding and channel estimation techniques",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 and @xmath1 can perform self - interference cancelation and remove their own transmitted codewords from the received signal .",
    "four time slots needed in a traditional one - way transmission for the forward and backward channels to accomplish one - round information exchange between @xmath0 and @xmath1 via the relay node can be reduced to two in twrns by comparison .    in a realistic multi - user wireless network , e.g. is-856 system @xcite which has more relaxed delay requirements , the transmission power is fixed while the rate can be adapted according to the channel conditions . moreover , automatic repeat request ( arq ) techniques have been applied to improve the transmission reliability above the physical layer @xcite . prior works @xcite , @xcite also show there is a compromise between transmission rate @xmath2 and arq such that the network average successful throughput , i.e. , the goodput , can be maximized at an optimal rate @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the goodput analysis , we in this paper are interested in energy - efficient operation . in such cases , the energy consumption due to retransmission should also be taken into account to evaluate the energy efficiency with respect to @xmath2 . hence , we investigate the joint optimization of @xmath2 ( at the physical layer ) and the number of arq retransmissions ( at the data - link layer ) by adopting a cross - layer framework in twrns .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the twrn model , channel assumptions as well as its general working mechanism . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we investigate the markov chain model under both af and df modes to derive the analytical expressions for the bit energy consumption and goodput . in section",
    "v , the numerical results are shown to compare the system performance in af and df modes .",
    "section vi provides the conclusion .",
    "in figure 1 , we depict a 3-node twrn where source nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 can only exchange information via the relay node . codewords @xmath4 and @xmath5 from @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , have equal length and unit energy .",
    "all nodes are working in half - duplex mode and the channels between @xmath0 and the relay , and @xmath1 and the relay are modeled as complex gaussian random variables with distributions @xmath6 and @xmath7 . without loss of generality , we also assume channel reciprocity such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 have identical distributions as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "odd and even time slots have equal length , which is the time to transmit one codeword , and are dedicated for uplink and downlink data transmissions , respectively .",
    "ack and nack control packets are assumed to be always successfully received and the trivial processing time is ignored .",
    "additive gaussian noise at the receiver terminals is modeled as @xmath12 .",
    "there are two more key assumptions : 1 ) channel codes support communication at the instantaneous channel capacity levels , and outages , which occur if transmission rate exceeds the instantaneous channel capacity , lead to packet errors and are perfectly detected at the receivers ; 2 ) depending on whether packets are successfully received or not , ack or nack control frames are sent and received with no errors . based on above network formulations",
    ", we can further discuss the twrn working procedure according to the current network states under af and df relay schemes , and find out the inherent impact of the transmission rate @xmath2 on network performances .",
    "the twrn in af mode can be visualized as two bi - directional cascade channels where in the odd time slots , @xmath0 and @xmath1 send individual codewords simultaneously to the relay and the signals are actually superimposed in the wireless medium .",
    "the relay will then amplify the received signals proportional to the average received power and broadcast the combined signals back to @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the even time slots .    according to fig.[fig : twrn ] , the received signals at the relay in odd time slots is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the transmit power of @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively",
    ". the relay will forward @xmath16 with a scaling factor @xmath17 which is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relay s transmit power .    here",
    ", we normalize the variance of the channel between @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath20 and by using a normalized distance factor @xcite @xmath21 while assuming the variances of the other links are proportional to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the path loss coefficient , we then have @xmath24 and @xmath25 . at the end of even time slots , the received signals on @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are i.i.d gaussian noise components . assuming the instantaneous channel state information is perfectly known at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the self - interference part can be removed from @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the signals for decoding can be represented by @xmath32    the cascade channel instantaneous rate from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and from @xmath1 to @xmath0 are hence represented by @xmath33    to describe the network mechanism more accurately , we need to formulate the protocol of twrn in af mode as follows :    1 .",
    "each transmission round contains two consecutive time slots . in the odd slot , source nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "both transmit codewords to the relay with transmission rate @xmath2 bit / sec / hz , and the relay in the following even slot broadcasts @xmath34 back to source nodes .",
    "2 .   at the end of one transmission round , @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 perform self - interference cancelation ( sic ) to subtract their own weighted messages , and decode @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "if the decoding fails , an outage event will be declared on that cascade link .",
    "the outage event on the cascade link @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) is defined as the probability of the event @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) .",
    "ack or nack packets would be sent back to the relay based on successful transmission or outage .",
    "the relay will also notify @xmath0 and @xmath1 whether a new codeword or an old codeword should be ( re)transmitted in the next odd time slot with the control packet information .",
    "the network state transition diagram of the af twrn can be modeled as a markov chain as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : af - markov ] , where the probability on each path denotes the probability of the transition between two states . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are defined as the outage probabilities on the cascade @xmath37 and @xmath38 links and are given by @xmath43 ( [ eq : af - outage0 ] ) and ( [ eq : af - outage ] ) can be determined using the cumulative distribution function of the random variable @xmath44 @xcite @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are independent exponential distributed with mean @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is a constant . in this context , we know @xmath51,\\,\\hspace{0.3cm}\\mu_{2}=e[|h_{r2}|^2 ] , \\hspace{0.3 cm } for \\hspace{0.3 cm } p_{12}\\\\ \\mu_{1}=e[|h_{2r}|^2],\\,\\hspace{0.3cm}\\mu_{1}=e[|h_{r1}|^2 ] , \\hspace{0.3 cm } for \\hspace{0.3 cm } p_{21}\\\\ \\alpha=\\frac{1}{\\beta^2 } \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the given network parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be derived accordingly .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : af - state ] , it is explicitly seen at the beginning of each odd time slot that both @xmath52 and @xmath53 transmit to the relay such that at the beginning of each even time slot , the relay is always in the ready - for - broadcasting state @xmath54 and will consequently transition to @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , or @xmath58 with certain probabilities .",
    "we first determine the following four equations according to the state transitions in the markov chain to derive the probability of each state : @xmath59 after solving the set of equations in ( [ eq : af - markov - equations ] ) , we obtain @xmath60 . we know from the inherent characteristics of the af twrn that the data exchange only happens in the broadcasting phases with successful packet delivery . therefore , the system goodput is defined similarly as in @xcite by @xmath61 ( [ eq : af - goodput ] ) indicates through the terms @xmath41 and @xmath42 that a higher transmission rate @xmath2 will result in higher packet error rates ( outage ) , leading to more arq retransmissions which equivalently reduce the data rate .",
    "intuitively , a balance between transmission rate and the number of arq retransmissions needs to be found such that the goodput is maximized .",
    "energy efficiency has always been a major concern in wireless networks .",
    "recently , power or energy efficiency in wireless one - way relay networks have been extensively studied . in @xcite ,",
    "the average bit energy consumption @xmath62 is minimized by determining the optimal number of bits per symbol , i.e. , the constellation size , in a specific modulation format .",
    "similarly as in one - way relay channels , the outage probabilities in twrns are functions of the transmission rate @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , there could be an increased number of outage events on the cascade channels when codewords are transmitted at a high rate .",
    "in such a case , more retransmissions and higher energy expenditure are needed to accomplish the reliable packet delivery . therefore , we are interested in a possible realization of twrn operation , which can provide a well - balanced performance on both the goodput @xmath63 and the required energy .",
    "we evaluate this by formulating the average bit energy consumption @xmath62 required for successfully exchanging one information bit between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we then evaluate @xmath62 by considering long - term transmissions on twrn .",
    "regardless of the previous state , whenever the relay is in state @xmath54 and is broadcasting , the resulting state would be any of the other four states previously described .",
    "assuming there are @xmath64 rounds of two - way transmission , each of which consists of a pair of consecutive time slots and each codeword has @xmath65 bits .",
    "therefore , with @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of transmission round corresponding to state @xmath68 , the average bit energy consumption could be derived as the ratio of total bits successfully exchanged over total energy consumption : @xmath69",
    "the df twrn differs from the af twrn in that there is a crucial intermediate decoding procedure at the the relay when it has received the codeword from the uplink transmission .",
    "if both source nodes are allowed to send codewords to the relay simultaneously in the uplink transmission , the decoding at the relay has to deal with the multiple access problem in a realistic application , with successive interference cancelation techniques . to reduce the hardware complexity and increase the feasibility of implementation",
    ", we hereby adopt the df twrn mode from @xcite where the relay performs sequential decode - and - forward .",
    "the outage probabilities on @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 links are denoted as @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the protocol for sequential df twrn",
    "is described as follows :    1 .   in the initial state @xmath55 ,",
    "the relay s buffer is empty and the relay first polls on @xmath0 until it receives codeword @xmath78 successfully with probability @xmath79 .",
    "then , the state moves to @xmath56 which means the relay holds @xmath4 in the buffer .",
    "otherwise , the state remains as @xmath55 with probability @xmath74 .",
    "if the relay already has @xmath4 , it starts polling @xmath1 .",
    "the state @xmath56 either changes to @xmath58 with probability @xmath80 upon successfully receiving @xmath5 , or stays in @xmath56 with @xmath75 .",
    "3 .   when the relay has both @xmath4 and @xmath5 , it generates a new codeword @xmath81 according to a gaussian codebook of @xmath82 with equal power allocation .",
    "then at rate @xmath2 , it broadcasts to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which will perform sic to decode @xmath5 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the state will transit to @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 or @xmath58 with corresponding probabilities @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 or @xmath86 respectively .",
    "4 .   at the beginning of next transmission round",
    ", the relay will decide to poll a new codeword from @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) based on the previous state being @xmath55,@xmath57 ( or @xmath56 ) or just retransmits the old @xmath87 if the previous state was @xmath58 .",
    "the network state transition diagram of the df twrn can be modeled as in fig .",
    "[ fig : df - markov ] with detailed probabilities on each path .",
    "since the relay receives and decodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 at different time slots , the received signals at the relay from uplink transmissions can be represented as @xmath88 similar to ( [ eq : af - sic ] ) , the signals for decoding at @xmath0 and @xmath1 after sic has been performed can be written as @xmath89      similarly as in the discussion of the goodput of af twrn in section iii , the data exchange only occurs upon the successful signal receptions at @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the end of the broadcasting time slot .",
    "hence , initially , it is necessary to calculate the probability of being in state stays 3 , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "we start from calculating the outage probabilities on the forward and backward channels as @xmath91 the probabilities of buffer states can be solved by noting the following relations from fig .",
    "[ fig : df - markov ] : @xmath92 solving the equations in ( [ eq : df - markov - equations ] ) with given outage probabilities , we can obtain the following results for the buffer states : @xmath93 where the polynomial in the denominators is denoted by @xmath94 therefore , the system goodput in the df mode can be derived as @xmath95      @xmath62 in the df twrn is more complicated to calculate than in the af twrn where each transmission round has fixed power as can be seen in ( [ eq : af - eb ] ) .",
    "hence , in the df scenario , we have to separate the energy expenditure into two parts , energy consumption in the first stage and energy consumption in the second stage .",
    "the first stage denotes the state transition from any of 4 previous states to state @xmath58 , where the relay holds two codewords @xmath4 and @xmath5 in its buffer and is ready to broadcast .",
    "the second stage is that the relay broadcasts its newly generated codeword and the state transits back to any of the four states again .",
    "considering the relay s buffer is to be loaded with both codewords @xmath4 and @xmath5 from any of the previous states on the first stage , the energy consumption conditioned on the previous state @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , or @xmath58 on this particular transition will be @xmath96 on the second stage , the energy consumption for broadcasting is always @xmath97 , so the average bit energy consumption for one information bit successfully exchanged on the df twrn can be computed as @xmath98 whenever the state probabilities and outage probabilities are known .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results to evaluate the system performance of twrn in both af and df modes .",
    "the network configurations are assumed to be as follows : relay is located in the middle between @xmath0 and @xmath1 which means @xmath99 .",
    "the power spectrum density of the gaussian white noise is @xmath100 and the channel bandwidth is set to @xmath101 hz .",
    "path loss coefficient is @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "we also assume the same transmit power for both source nodes and the relay , which is @xmath103 and define the snr by @xmath104 .",
    "firstly , we are particularly interested in how the goodput varies as a function of the transmission rate @xmath2 at specific snr values . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - r ] , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are plotted as functions of @xmath2 , with solid and dashed lines corresponding to af and df modes , respectively . on each curve with a given specific @xmath107 value ,",
    "it s immediately seen that the goodput first increases within low @xmath2 range and then begins to drop once the rate is increased beyond the optimal @xmath3 which maximizes the goodput @xmath63 .",
    "additionally , at low values of the rate @xmath2 , the af twrn has higher goodput @xmath105 , while beyond a certain rate @xmath2 , df starts to outperform , regardless of the snr @xmath107 value .    to better illustrate the goodput performance in af and df modes , we look into transmission efficiency by defining a normalized rate @xmath108 and plotting it in fig .",
    "[ fig : normal - r ] .",
    "the normalized rate is always decreasing when @xmath2 increases at all snr s in both af and df .",
    "in other words , increasing outage probabilities due to increasing @xmath2 has eventually resulted in more arq retransmissions . specifically in the high snr scenario ,",
    "the normalized rate levels off between 0.6 and 0.7 in af and 0.9 and 1 in df , which means the transmission efficiency does nt change too much within this rate range .",
    "in addition , the af mode seems to have higher normalized rate in low rate range .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eb - r ] , we analyze the energy efficiency .",
    "we notice that the difference of the average bit energy consumptions between two modes is insignificant up until @xmath109 , but df stills has a better energy efficiency with a lower @xmath62 regardless of @xmath107 .",
    "however when compared with the corresponding points ( @xmath110 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : normal - r ] , it is shown that even though df can achieve a slightly lower @xmath62 than af , it also suffers a lower transmission efficiency in the metric of lower normalized rate . above @xmath109 in low snr scenario of @xmath111 , af predominates with both higher normalized rate and lower @xmath112 until @xmath2 approaches about @xmath113 bits / sec / hz .",
    "similar results can be observed on the high snr scenarios also . in fig .",
    "[ fig : normal - snr ] , we study the impact of snr on the normalized rate in both af and df .",
    "basically the normalized rate is increasing as snr increases at all transmission rates . at low snr e.g. @xmath114 , df performs better than af .",
    "as snr approaches @xmath115 , the normalized rate gets close to 1 ( or 0.7 ) in af ( or df ) mode .",
    "consequently , one way to improve on the transmission efficiency is to increase snr in the twrn .",
    "considering overall impacts of rate @xmath2 and snr , we can always find an scheme for the twrn to achieve optimality in respect to the goodput @xmath63 , the average bit energy consumption @xmath62 or the transmission efficiency .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the two - way relay networks working in amplify - and - forward and decode - and - forward modes . in each mode",
    ", we set up a markov chain model to analyze the state transition in details .",
    "arq transmission is employed to guarantee the successful packet delivery at the end and mathematical expressions for the goodput and bit energy consumption have been derived .",
    "several interesting results are observed from simulation results : 1 ) the transmission rate @xmath2 can be optimized to achieve a maximal goodput in both af and df modes ; 2 ) generally the transmission efficiency is higher in af within a certain @xmath2 range , while the df can achieve a slightly higher energy efficiency instead ; 3 ) increasing snr will always increase the normalized rate regardless of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , it s possible the network performance be optimized in a balanced manner to maintain a relatively high goodput as well as a low @xmath62 .",
