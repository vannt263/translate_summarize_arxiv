    "in this paper , we generalize the construction of schemes to other algebraic categories .",
    "there are already many attempts of extending the category of schemes , for various reasons .",
    "one of it is from the geometry over @xmath1 : the rough idea is to construct a scheme - like topological object from monoids .",
    "there are numerous attempts towards this goal , and we can not list them all . here , we just mention that there is a survey on this topic @xcite . in this article , we focus on the relation between the construction of ours and those of ton - vaqui @xcite , and deitmar @xcite .",
    "( the latter two constructions are actually equivalent , according to @xcite . )",
    "however , not many have mentioned its universal property of the proposed new objects and categories . to claim that the new objects are  good \"",
    ", we must make it explicit how it is similar to schemes .",
    "in other words , we should ask to ourselves , we know how schemes are useful , but we do nt know why . despite its heavy and complicated machinary , the category of schemes behaves surprisingly good .",
    "this implies that the construction of schemes , or almost equivalently , the spectrum functor , should be realized as an adjoint of a simpler functor .    in this paper",
    ", we go back to this fundamental question : we give the universal characterization of the category of coherent schemes .",
    "the universality can not be obtained , only by specifying the algebraic object : even if we restrict ourselves to rings , there are several ways of defining a scheme - like objects .",
    "therefore , we must designate its grothendieck topology .",
    "also , we must be aware that the category of schemes is not complete , although the category of rings is co - complete .",
    "therefore , in order to give a universal property , we should be able to apply the spectrum functor to schemes : if we call the scheme - like @xmath2-valued spaces as @xmath2-schemes , then we must be able to define @xmath3-schemes .",
    "this implies that the usual definition of schemes is not appropriate : it uses the notion of local rings and local homomorphisms where infinite operations occur , which is not available for schemes in general .",
    "therefore , we give another way of describing this local property , only using finite operations on the value category .",
    "this idea is already mentioned in the previous preprint of the author @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this definition is that we can define the spectrum functor as an adjoint of the global section functor , which is by nature , much simpler .",
    "another advantage is that this gives a way to define a larger category containing all coherent schemes , which is complete : see @xcite .    here , we will list up the main results .",
    "let @xmath0 be a category with pull backs and finite coproducts , equipped with a grothendieck topology @xmath4 ( the precise definition is given in  3 ) .",
    "we call the triple @xmath5 a coherent site",
    ". this is _ schematic _",
    ", if it admits finite open patchings ( again , the definition is given in  3 ) .",
    "let @xmath6 , @xmath7 be the ( 2-)categories of coherent sites , schematic coherent sites , respectively .    1 .",
    "the underlying functor @xmath8 admits a left adjoint @xmath9 .",
    "the unit is the spectrum functor @xmath10 .",
    "( theorem [ thm : univ : coh : sch ] ) 2 .",
    "when @xmath0 is the opposite category of commutative rings , with the topology induced from ideals , then @xmath0-schemes are coherent schemes .",
    "( theorem [ thm : sch : local : space ] )    the universal property of the zariski topology is summarized as follows :    let @xmath2 be a self enhancing algebraic type with a constant operator , and @xmath11 be the type of commutative monoid objects in the category of @xmath2-algebras . if the morphism class @xmath12 consists of localizations of finite type , then the zariski topology is the coarsest topology satisfying the following condition :    for any @xmath11-algebra @xmath13 and @xmath13-module @xmath14 , the induced @xmath15-module @xmath16 is zero if and only if @xmath17 .",
    "note that this paper is only a stepping stone to various generalizations .",
    "however , we decided to rewrite it from the first step : since although the scheme theory is already a classical topic , its universal property is scarcely discussed , and we need it to be clarified to apply its machinary to other workfields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 , we give a brief summary of algebraic types and lattice theories .",
    "the reader may skip this section , if he or she is familiar with the terminology .    in  3 , we discuss the universal property of @xmath0-schemes : namely it is given by the universal property of schematic topological category under @xmath0 . in the process , we introduce the notion of weak @xmath0-schemes , which is the generalization of @xmath18-schemes . using this",
    ", we obtain the spectrum functor as an adjoint of the global section functor .    in  4 ,",
    "we compare our notion of @xmath0-schemes with the conventional coherent schemes .",
    "this is somewhat time - consuming , since the definitions of the two are very different . here",
    ", we also show the correspondence between the ideals and the grothendieck topology .",
    "finally in  5 , we discuss the universal property of ideal topology .",
    "note that the ground of choosing the ideal topology is only given by looking at modules .",
    "when we talk of algebraic objects other than rings , we know that congruences take place of ideals .",
    "however , the result obtained here shows that this is a groundless fear , since the ideal topology detects modules similarly as in the case of rings .",
    "* notation and conventions : * in the sequel , we assume the reader to be familiar with category - theoretic languages ; the textbook @xcite will be sufficient for this purpose .",
    "we fix a universe , and do not mention it when unnecessary .",

    "here , we begin with the definition of algebraic types . conventionally , an algebraic type is a pair @xmath20 of the set of operators and equational classes .",
    "however , to define equational classes ( and therefore , derived operators ) explicitly , it requires some terminology of _ trees _ , or _ languages_.",

    "then , @xmath41 admits a left adjoint .",
