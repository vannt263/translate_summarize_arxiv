    "x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath0 ) of single neutron stars strongly depends on the rate of rotational energy loss (  ) @xmath6 .",
    " depends on the spin period ( p ) and time derivative of the spin period ( p ) of neutron stars . as there",
    "exist many other parameters of pulsars determined from p and p values , l@xmath0 must also depend on these parameters .",
    "this problem has already been analysed using values of l@xmath0 in 2 - 10 kev band for different groups of pulsars including also the old millisecond pulsars @xmath7 .",
    "we also prefer to use the l@xmath0 values in 2 - 10 kev band , because the absorption is strong in the softer x - ray band and also there must be a contribution of the cooling radiation to the soft x - ray part of the radiation of pulsar which may complicate the problem .",
    "below , using reliable distance values we have analysed in detail the dependence of l@xmath2 on different pulsar parameters for young single pulsars for which the radiation is related to ejection of relativistic particles . in this investigation",
    "we have also used the values of pulsar radiation in 0.1 - 2.4 kev band and the radiation of pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) in both bands .",
    "special attention has been paid to the evolutionary factors . there",
    "exist many pulsars with large values of  and small values of age from which no x - ray radiation has been observed .",
    "below , we have also discussed possible reasons of this .",
    "for the pulsed radio emission to occur and in order to produce radiation ( excluding cooling radiation ) in x - rays and also to form pwn , there must be ejection of high - energy particles . the production of these kinds of radiation and pwn must depend on different parameters of neutron star .",
    "note that the magnetic field may not be pure magneto - dipole field and the angle between the magnetic field and the spin axis is uncertain .",
    "these facts also make the solution of the problems more difficult .",
    "we want to figure out whether x - ray radiation of pulsars and the formation of pwn depend on  or the electric field intensity ( e@xmath8 ) more strongly for the case of pure magneto - dipole radiation . in order to clarify these problems ,",
    "we have constructed x - ray luminosity ( 2 - 10 kev ) versus  diagram for all radio and single x - ray pulsars with characteristic time ( @xmath1 ) @xmath910@xmath10 yr located up to 7 kpc from the sun including also 2 pulsars in magellanic clouds ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the data of these pulsars are represented in table 1 .    depending on values of the magnetic field and the speed of rotation on the surface of neutron star",
    ", there arises induced electric field of which the intensity is represented as @xmath11 : @xmath12 where r is the radius of neutron star , b@xmath13 the value of the real magnetic field strength and c the speed of light .",
    "in actuality , pulsars are located in plasma and expression ( 1 ) does not give the exact value of e@xmath8 . as the p - p diagram which we use is always represented in logarithmic scale , the lines of constant e@xmath8 pass parallel to the lines of constant characteristic time @xmath14 so that , we do not show the lines of e@xmath8=constant on the p - p diagram .",
    "calculated values of e@xmath8 may also contain some mistakes , because different pulsars may have different radius , moment of inertia ( i ) and braking index .    often , there is pwn around the youngest pulsars which we include in table 1 . for such cases",
    "the x - ray luminosity value include both the x - ray radiation of the pulsar and of the pwn in most of the cases , as it is difficult to distinguish the l@xmath0(pwn ) part of the luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "since the contribution of the pwn to the x - ray luminosity can be at most comparable with the x - ray luminosity of the pulsar in general @xmath15 , the change in the positions of the pulsars in the figures will be small in such cases that the dependences found from the best fits do not change considerably .",
    "it must also be noted that the uncertainties in the distance values and in the measured 2 - 10 kev fluxes can not have significant influences on these dependences .",
    "the pulsars with @xmath1@xmath910@xmath10 yr located up to 7 kpc for which the x - ray luminosity only in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band is known are also displayed in table 1 .",
    "we have adopted reliable values of distance for the pulsars @xmath16 and x - ray luminosity data mainly have been taken from possenti et al .",
    "@xmath7 and becker & aschenbach @xmath15 .    the dependence between x - ray luminosity ( 2 - 10 kev ) and  is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the equation of this dependence is : @xmath17 in figure 2 , x - ray luminosity ( 2 - 10 kev ) versus @xmath1 diagram is represented for the same pulsar sample shown in figure 1 .",
    "the equation for the relation between x - ray luminosity ( 2 - 10 kev ) and @xmath1 is : @xmath18 as seen from figures 1 and 2 , the deviations of the data with respect to the best fits shown in the figures are larger in the l@xmath0 ( 2 - 10 kev ) versus @xmath1 diagram compared to the l@xmath0 ( 2 - 10 kev ) versus  diagram , but there is no significant difference .",
    "some pulsars in table 1 have @xmath5-ray radiation .",
    "as seen from figure 1 , these pulsars are in general located below the best fit line . on the other hand , all the pulsars with large effective magnetic field ( b ) values ( log b @xmath3 12.7 ) are located above the line ( note that when there exist some additional mechanisms other than the magneto - dipole mechanism , b@xmath3b@xmath13 ) .",
    "we have not designated these pulsars in figure 2 but notice that @xmath5-ray pulsars in this figure are located in both parts with respect to the best fit line , whereas , all the pulsars with large values of b have positions below the line .",
    "this is also the result of different dependences of e@xmath8 ( see expression ( 1 ) ) and rate of rotational energy loss @xmath19 on the value of p ( note that in this approximation we neglect the dependences of the observational and the calculated parameters of pulsars on the radius and mass of neutron stars ) .",
    "which parameters of neutron stars do the deviations in figures 1 and 2 mainly depend on ? in order to understand this ,",
    "we have examined pulsars in narrow  intervals with large differences in their l@xmath0 values which lead to large deviations .",
    "the largest deviation is for the interval log =36.78 - 36.9 where pulsars j1846 - 0258 , j1811 - 1925 , and vela are present .",
    "these are not ordinary pulsars : pulsars j1846 - 0258 and j1811 - 1925 are strong x - ray pulsars which have not been detected in other bands , whereas , vela pulsar , which has been known as a radio , optical and gamma - ray pulsar until recently , has been identified also in x - rays but with low luminosity @xmath10 .",
    "the l@xmath0 ( 2 - 10 kev ) value of vela pulsar ( table 1 ) is more than one order of magnitude larger than the value given by possenti et al .",
    "this is because we have also included the x - ray luminosity of the pwn around the vela pulsar which is about 10 times greater than the x - ray luminosity of the pulsar @xmath20 and we have adopted a more reliable distance value @xmath16 so that the luminosity value also increased about 3 times . despite these facts , the position of vela pulsar in figure 1 is still well below the line and the difference between the luminosity values of vela pulsar and pulsar j1846 - 0258 is still very large .",
    "although , the period value of pulsar j1846 - 0258 is 4 - 5 times larger than the period values of vela pulsar and pulsar 1811 - 1925 , since the magnetic field @xmath21 and  values of pulsar j1846 - 0258 are larger than the values of the other two pulsars ( even though the @xmath1 value is small ) , its luminosity ( 2 - 10 kev ) value is larger ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the second largest deviation among large  values in figure 1 is in the log =37.21 - 37.42 interval where pulsars j1513 - 5908 , j0205 + 6449 , j1617 - 5055 , and j2229 + 6114 are located in .",
    "pulsar j1513 - 5908 , the youngest one among these pulsars , has the largest p , b and l@xmath0 values . among the other pulsars in this group",
    ", the largest  value belongs to pulsar j0205 + 6449 in this interval and this pulsar has a smaller value of @xmath1 , a larger value of b , and a period value in between the values of pulsars j1617 - 5055 and j2229 + 6114 . in spite of this",
    ", the luminosity of this pulsar is less than the luminosity of pulsar j1617 - 5055 .",
    "this is strange , because all four parameters ( p , @xmath1 , b ,  ) of pulsar j0205 + 6449 suggest a larger luminosity value .",
    "furthermore , there is no supernova shell or pwn around pulsar j1617 - 5055 .",
    "this contradiction is not because of the adopted distance values .",
    "is this contradiction related to the uncertainties in the observational data ?",
    "although , the luminosity values of these 2 pulsars ( j0205 + 6449 and j1617 - 5055 ) are comparable within error limits @xmath7 , one still can not explain why pulsar j0205 + 6449 does not have a larger l@xmath0 value .",
    "if the observational data are not significantly different than the actual values , then either there may be a considerable difference in the mass values of these 2 pulsars or the magnetic field may not be pure dipole .    among the youngest pulsars , the largest deviations are in the log @xmath1=3.19 - 3.22 interval .",
    "among the pulsars in this interval , the smallest p and the largest  values belong to pulsar j0540 - 6919 which has also the largest l@xmath0 value . in this interval",
    ", the smallest l@xmath0 value belongs to pulsar j1119 - 6127 which has the largest p and b values and the smallest  value .",
    "according to gonzalez & safi - harb @xmath22 , j1119 - 6127 has unabsorbed l@xmath0 ( 0.5 - 10",
    "kev)=5.5@xmath23@xmath2410@xmath25 erg / s at 6 kpc .",
    "there is no pulsed x - ray radiation observed from radio pulsar j1119 - 6127 and the position of the x - ray source is not coincident with the position of the radio pulsar ; the observed point source may actually be a pwn @xmath26 .",
    "pulsar j0358 + 5413 has log @xmath1=5.75 and pulsar j0538 + 2817 has log @xmath1=5.79 .",
    "the l@xmath0 value of pulsar j0358 + 5413 is about 300 times larger than the l@xmath0 value of pulsar j0538 + 2817 , but the p , b and  values of these 2 pulsars are roughly the same . why is pulsar j0358 + 5413 much more luminous than pulsar j0538 + 2817 ?",
    "the absolute error of the l@xmath0 ( 2 - 10 kev ) value of pulsar j0358 + 5413 is very large @xmath7 and the l@xmath0 ( 2 - 10 kev ) value is not a directly measured value but converted by possenti et al .",
    "@xmath7 from the l@xmath0 value in softer band @xmath27 .",
    "so , the high l@xmath0 ( 2 - 10 kev ) value of pulsar j0358 + 5413 can actually be much lower and the large difference in the l@xmath0 ( 2 - 10 kev ) values of pulsars j0358 + 5413 and j0538 + 2817 can actually be much smaller .",
    "if we consider the corrections to the positions of some of the pulsars discussed above taking also into account relations between l@xmath0 and  , @xmath1 , b and p , and if we change the positions of the pulsars in the figures within error limits given in possenti et al .",
    "@xmath7 then , pulsar j1119 - 6127 will have a higher l@xmath0 value , whereas , pulsars j1826 - 1334 , j1302 - 6350 and j0358 + 5413 will have lower values of l@xmath0 . in this case , the dependence between l@xmath0 and @xmath1 given in eqn.(4 ) will be improved with a more negative power of @xmath1 .",
    "if we apply the same approach for the positions of some of the pulsars in figure 1 , we see that the deviations do not decrease and the power of  ( eqn.(3 ) ) increases negligibly .",
    "some of the pulsars shown in figures 1,2 and in table 1 have experienced strong glitches ( @xmath28@xmath310@xmath29 , denoted with g in figure 2 ) . as seen from figure 2",
    ", the deviations of the data do not seem to be due to the glitch activity .",
    "since the values of p and p and the other parameters change continuously during the pulsar evolution , the value of l@xmath2 must also change in connection to this .",
    "we want to analyse how the l@xmath2 luminosity of pulsars changes during the evolution of pulsars on the p - p diagram .    from eqn .",
    "( 3 ) we see that @xmath30 and similarly from eqn . ( 4 ) @xmath31 using the expressions for  ( 5 ) and @xmath1 ( 2 ) . now , using the expression for b ( 6 ) , we can write ( 7 ) and ( 8) in the form : @xmath32 and @xmath33 if both dependences ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are applicable in finding the value of l@xmath0 , then the ratio of the luminosities for each pulsar found from equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) must roughly be the same throughout the evolution of a pulsar . from dependences ( 10 ) and ( 9 ) we get : @xmath34 so , the ratio is strongly dependent on p which must be wrong because the ratio must not change significantly during the evolution if both dependences are reliable .",
    "x - ray luminosity of the considered pulsars strongly depends on different parameters of pulsars and decreases with age down to l@xmath0@xmath3510@xmath36 - 10@xmath37 erg / s . during the evolution of these pulsars ,",
    "the period value changes up to a factor of 10 , p up to 50 times ,  up to 10@xmath11 times , and @xmath1 up to 500 times . during the evolution , value of b for each pulsar may decrease only up to a factor of 3 , but magnitudes of the deviation of b values for different pulsars are larger .    as seen from figure 5 , an increase in the initial magnetic field value of a factor of 10 leads to a decrease in the age of x - ray pulsar of a factor of 10 .",
    "as x - ray luminosity of young pulsars strongly depends on e@xmath8 and  , as seen from the l@xmath0-@xmath1 diagram ( figure 2 ) and figure 5 , the x - ray luminosity of the pulsars with largest initial b values drop very quickly below the threshold during the evolution , whereas , the x - ray luminosity of the pulsars with smaller initial values of b last longer and drop below the threshold in about 10@xmath16 yr .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider a more homogeneous group of pulsars which have b values close to each other .",
    "naturally , the best fit lines for the new sample must lead to a different equation for the l@xmath0-@xmath1 dependence and practically the same equation for the l@xmath0- dependence . in order to see this , we have constructed l@xmath0 vs.  and l@xmath0 vs. @xmath1 diagrams ( figures 3 and 4 ) for the pulsars with b values in the interval 12.2 @xmath38 log b @xmath38 12.7 ( figure 5 ) . again from the best fits , we get dependences between l@xmath0 and  : @xmath39 and l@xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath40 from these two dependences it is seen that the dependence given by eqn.(3 ) is comparable to the dependence given by eqn.(12 ) within error limits , but the dependence given by eqn.(4 ) changed considerably ( see eqn.(13 ) ) .    dividing eqn.(13 ) by eqn.(12 ) and again using the expressions ( 5 ) and ( 2 ) we get : @xmath41 as the effective b value decreases gradually during the evolution , the large increase in the p value compensates it and the ratio remains approximately the same .",
    "the dependences ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) are more reliable and reflect the evolutionary effects , because we have used a more homogeneous group of pulsars with similar evolutionary tracks in figures 3 and 4 . the ratio given by dependence ( 14 )",
    "shows this fact .",
    "the reason of the considerable difference between the dependences ( 4 ) and ( 13 ) can easily be seen in figure 5 . as seen from this figure , when the value of @xmath1 is small , first the constant @xmath1 line crosses the considered b interval ( i.e. the interval of 12.2 @xmath38 log b @xmath38 12.7 ) where the value of  is large .",
    "then , it crosses the region , which is not included in the b interval under consideration , where the value of  is small . on the other hand ,",
    "if the value of @xmath1 is large , then the constant @xmath1 line first crosses a region , outside the considered b interval , where pulsars with large values of  are located , and then it crosses the b interval under consideration where pulsars with small  values are present .",
    "therefore , for small values of @xmath1 , the pulsars which have smaller values of l@xmath2 and which are not located in the considered interval have positions below the best fit line in figure 4 .",
    "on the other hand , for large values of @xmath1 , the pulsars which have larger values of l@xmath2 and which are not located in the considered interval have positions above the best fit line in figure 4 . excluding the pulsars with large deviations from the best fit line",
    "leads to the considerable difference between the dependences ( 4 ) and ( 13 ) .    in table 1",
    ", we have also included the 15 pulsars with @xmath1@xmath910@xmath16 yr and/or log @xmath335.60 from which no x - ray radiation has been detected . in figure 5 , all the 48 pulsars in table 1 are displayed . within and around this region of the p - p diagram , there are pulsars with detected x - ray radiation .",
    "all of these pulsars without detected x - ray radiation are also located at d@xmath387 kpc from the sun .",
    "one of these pulsars is connected to a supernova remnant ( snr ) .    as seen from figure 5 and table 1 ,",
    "there are some pulsars without observed x - ray radiation which have smaller @xmath1 values and larger  values compared to some pulsars with observed x - ray radiation .",
    "what is the reason for not detecting x - ray radiation from such pulsars ?",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the x - ray luminosity must depend not only on p and p but also on some other parameters .",
    "the deviations of the data from the best fits in figures 1 - 4 also show this fact .",
    "it is not easy to examine these `` other parameters '' which can not be calculated from values of p and p and get realiable results .",
    "but it is possible to clarify why there exist those pulsars with smaller @xmath1 values and larger  values from which no x - ray radiation has been detected by examining the selection effects .",
    "it is clear that it is more difficult to observe the x - ray radiation of a pulsar if it is located at a large distance in the galactic plane and in the galactic centre direction .",
    "all the 8 pulsars with @xmath1@xmath310@xmath16 yr from which x - ray radiation has been observed as shown in figure 5 are located at distances d@xmath92.5 kpc from the sun ( figure 6 ) .",
    "directions of these and all the other pulsars in table 1 are shown in b vs. l diagram ( figure 7 ) .",
    "in figure 6 ,   d diagram for all the 48 pulsars in table 1 is represented .",
    "the pulsars without observed x - ray radiation are all located beyond 2 kpc from the sun .",
    "it is normal to detect x - ray radiation from pulsars with large  values even at large distances ( see figure 6 ) , but there is a pulsar , namely j0631 + 1036 , with detected x - ray radiation in the 2 - 10 kev band which is located at d=6.6 kpc and has a smaller  value ( log =35.24 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that this pulsar is located in the galactic anti - centre direction ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "the other 8 pulsars with detected x - ray radiation and with distances between 6 - 7 kpc are located in the galactic central directions .",
    "six out of the 8 far away pulsars in the central directions are connected to snrs that these are well examined pulsars .",
    "so , it must be considered normal to detect the x - ray radiation of these pulsars . on the other hand , the remaining 2 pulsars , namely j1105 - 6107 and j1617 - 5055",
    ", are not connected to snrs .",
    "pulsar j1617 - 5055 has very high  and large l@xmath0 values ( see table 1 ) , and pulsar j1105 - 6107 is located in between the sagittarius and the scutum arms so that it is normal to observe the x - ray emission of these 2 pulsars . all the pulsars without detected x - ray radiation are located in the central directions and in the directions of vela ob - associations ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "moreover , the pulsars with d@xmath384.1 kpc which have not been detected in x - rays ( j0940 - 5428 , j1809 - 1917 , j1718 - 3825 , j1531 - 5610 , j1509 - 5850 , j1913 + 1011 ) have all been found in recent pulsar surveys @xmath42 . in the near future , it is possible that all of these pulsars will be detected in x - rays .",
    "for single pulsars , the x - ray radiation due to the relativistic particles , which considerably exceeds the cooling radiation , is important and worth examining .",
    "power and spectrum of this radiation depend on the number and the energy spectra of the relativistic electrons in the magnetospheres of pulsars .",
    "they also depend on the number density of charged particles and the magnetic field in the magnetosphere .",
    "the x - ray radiation of pwne also depends on these quantities .",
    "x - ray radiation has also been observed from old single millisecond pulsars which is absolutely not cooling radiation but a result of coulomb interaction between the accelerated particles and the charged particles in the magnetosphere .",
    "since the parameters of millisecond pulsars practically do not vary in time and as they are not active as the young pulsars are , we do not consider them in this work .    from the investigations of single pulsars which radiate",
    "x - rays as a result of ejection of relativistic particles , we have concluded as follows : + 1 ) luminosity in 2 - 10 kev band ( often the total luminosity including the luminosity of the pwn ) strongly depends on electric field intensity e@xmath8 ( or @xmath1 ) , rate of rotational energy loss  , magnetic field b , period , and in smaller degree on some other parameters of neutron stars .",
    "+ 2 ) the dependence of l@xmath0 on  is practically the same for pulsars with very different values of b and with b=10@xmath43 - 10@xmath44 g. this is not true for the l@xmath0-@xmath1 dependence .",
    "+ 3 ) pulsars with different initial values of b and with @xmath1 about 10@xmath15 yr begin to evolve from different points of the l@xmath0- dependence and then continue to evolve with similar trajectories until l@xmath0 drops to @xmath3510@xmath37 erg / s , but the same pulsars begin and end their evolution in different parts of the l@xmath0-@xmath1 dependence and the evolutionary tracks are not parallel to the l@xmath0-@xmath1 dependence for all the pulsars under consideration .",
    "+ 4 ) the pulsars , which also radiate gamma - rays , with the same values of  as the other pulsars without gamma - ray radiation have several times smaller x - ray luminosities .",
    "+ 5 ) the pulsars which have pwne practically always have x - ray luminosities greater than 10@xmath4 erg / s .",
    "+ 6 ) practically , values of @xmath1 and  determine the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the increase in @xmath1 and the decrease in  simultaneously lead to a rapid decrease in l@xmath0 .",
    "value of l@xmath0 decreases from @xmath3510@xmath45 erg / s for @xmath353@xmath2410@xmath46 erg / s and @xmath1@xmath3510@xmath15 yr to @xmath3510@xmath37 erg / s for @xmath353@xmath2410@xmath47 erg / s and @xmath1@xmath353@xmath2410@xmath16 yr .",
    "if we take into account these and also the strength and spectra of the x - ray radiation of millisecond pulsars @xmath48 , we can have some preliminary conclusions about the acceleration of particles and their radiation .",
    "as the characteristic time of millisecond pulsars is about 4 - 5 orders of magnitude smaller compared to the young pulsars , their e@xmath8 values must be 200 - 250 times smaller than the e@xmath8 values of young pulsars . on the other hand , the value of e@xmath8 does not have a strong influence on the x - ray radiation of pulsars .",
    "the x - ray spectra of young pulsars are , on average , steeper compared to the spectra of millisecond pulsars .",
    "if we also consider the strong dependence of the x - ray radiation of all the pulsars on the value of  , we can conclude as follows : + 7 ) acceleration of particles mainly takes place in the field of magnetodipole radiation wave .",
    "e@xmath8 has a role of only triggering this process .",
    "+ 8) the high values of x - ray luminosity of young pulsars under the same  values and the steeper spectra of such pulsars are related to the large amount of charged particles in their magnetospheres as compared to millisecond pulsars .",
    "it is necessary to reexamine the x - ray flux values of j0205 + 6449 , j0358 + 5413 , and j0538 + 2817 in 2 - 10 kev band to understand the dependences of the x - ray luminosity on  , e@xmath8 , b and p values and the possible dependence on the energy spectra of the ejected particles .",
    "also , in order to understand the dependence of the x - ray radiation on different parameters of pulsars better , it is necessary to observe pulsars j0940 - 5428 , j1809 - 1917 , j1718 - 3825 , j1531 - 5610 , j1509 - 5850 , j1913 + 1011 preferably in the hard x - ray band .",
