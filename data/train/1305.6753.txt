    "the use of local majority rules to study voting systems was introduced by galam three decades ago to study bottom - up democratic voting in hierarchical structures @xcite .",

    "indeed , while sociophysics has been rejected by physicists in the eighties @xcite , it is has become today an active field of research among physicists all over the world @xcite .",
    "the local majority rule model has motivated a good deal of works under several names including the majority model and the majority vote model ( mvm ) .",
    "the nonequilibrium majority - vote model proposed by oliveira @xcite defined on two - dimensional regular lattices shows second - order phase transition with critical exponents @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 identical @xcite with those of equilibrium ising model @xcite that agree with hypothesis of grinstein _ et al .",
