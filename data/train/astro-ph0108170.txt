    "the earliest deep images at high latitude obtained with near - ir arrays revealed a population of galaxies not represented in optical surveys ( e.g. elston , rieke , & rieke 1988 ; mccarthy , persson & west 1992 ; hu & ridgway 1994 ) .",
    "these objects have colors and apparent magnitudes close to those expected of evolved massive galaxies at @xmath16 .",
    "selections based on @xmath17 lead to a heterogeneous population containing evolved stellar populations ( spinrad et al .",

    "1999 ; liu et al .",
    "2000 , cowie et al .",
    "while the reddest examples ( smail et al 1999 ) are sometimes associated with bright sub - mm sources and cm - wave sources , the bulk of the red galaxies do not appear to be strong cm to sub - mm continuum sources .",
    "a key issue in the hierarchical assembly picture of galaxy formation is the identification of the redshift range over which the most massive galaxies assemble .",
    "the effects of merging at @xmath19 are minor : the luminosity function evolves primarily through passive evolution ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 , cowie et al . 1996 ) and the merger rate is low ( carlberg et al 2000 ) . the rate of mass buildup via merging is dependent on the density of galaxies , the correlation function at relevant separations , and the distribution of pairwise velocities . for major mergers to play a dominant role in galaxy building",
    ", the clustering of at least some component of the normal galaxy population must be large relative to that at the current epoch .",
    "near - ir selection provides a powerful tool for removing the foreground of faint low redshift star forming galaxies and offers a path toward selecting galaxies at @xmath20 by stellar mass .",
    "the las campanas infrared ( lcir ) survey was crafted to select early - type galaxies at @xmath21 ( marzke et al .",
    "it is a near - ir survey to @xmath22 over a significant fraction of a square degree , supplemented by photometry in the ubvriz@xmath23 bands . in this _ letter _",
    "we present the basic observational results for the galaxy counts , colors and clustering properties , along with their implications based on simple modeling .",
    "future papers will augment these data and refine and broaden the interpretation .",
    "the data presented here are drawn from a subset of the lcir survey covering an area of 0.62 square degrees to a depth ranging from h@xmath24 to 21 in four fields : hubble deep field south ( hdfs ) , chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) , ssa22 and the ntt deep field .",
    "the @xmath0 data , obtained with the cirsi camera ( beckett et al . 1998 ) , are complemented by deep optical imaging : vri in all fields , u & b in hdfs , and z@xmath23 in cdfs .",

    "photometric catalogs were extracted for each field using @xmath26 aperture johnson magnitudes .    0.3 cm      in figure 1 we present the differential number magnitude relations for the complete @xmath0 selected sample and @xmath27 color selected sub - samples from the hdfs , cdfs , ssa22 and ntt fields .",
    "these counts are based on @xmath26 aperture magnitudes with aperture and incompleteness corrections derived from point sources .",

    "a full analysis of the number counts and their completeness are given in chen et al .",
    "( 2001@xmath25 ) and firth et al .",
    "the complete @xmath0 counts are similar in slope , dlog(n)/dm , and amplitude to the deep @xmath0 counts derived by yan et al .",
    "the @xmath28 counts are quite steep , dlog(n)/dm@xmath29 in the @xmath30 h @xmath31 range . at fainter levels",
    "the counts must flatten and the slope of the @xmath32 subsample appears to change near @xmath33 .",
    "the counts in the redder color bin appear to have the same slope as the @xmath32 counts for @xmath34 but with surface densities that fall roughly one order of magnitude per magnitude of increasingly red color . at bright magnitudes",
    "( e.g. h@xmath35 ) the red galaxies constitute roughly 0.5% of the total @xmath0 selected population with a surface density of a few per square degree , while at h@xmath36 they contribute roughly 10% of the total population at a density of @xmath37 per square degree .",
    "we note that our primary color - cut , @xmath38 , is roughly one magnitude bluer than the canonical `` ero '' color threshold of @xmath39 .",
    "we use a set of simple evolutionary models to examine both the red counts and the colors (   2.3 ) , computed with the pegase.2 code ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) and the gardner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) local k - band luminosity function .",
    "we identify the red galaxy population as those galaxies brighter than @xmath40 as fitted with a schechter function with @xmath41 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 . assuming the @xmath44 colors at the faint limit of our sample have a precision of @xmath45 magnitudes , this model luminosity function is evolved using a @xmath46 decaying star formation rate model and a number density that evolves as @xmath47 in a @xmath48 cosmology to predict the red galaxy number counts in figure  1 .",
    "density evolution with @xmath49 agrees well with the observed counts of galaxies with @xmath50 , and implies a decline in true space density of @xmath12% at @xmath51 .",
    "there have been a variety of measurements of the surface density of red objects from near - ir surveys , primarily based on r - k selected samples . at the faint end",

    "we plot the @xmath4 vs. @xmath44 diagram from the cdfs field , for @xmath57 .",
    "the points are color - coded on the basis of photometric redshifts ( chen et al .",
    "2001@xmath58 ; firth et al .",
    "2001 ) . the red galaxies with @xmath7 span more than three magnitudes in @xmath4 .",
    "this wide range of optical colors worked against previous searches for early - type galaxies at @xmath59 that required colors that matched purely passive models .",
    "it is particularly notable that very few of the red galaxies have @xmath60 , the color expected of purely old stellar populations .",
    "our estimated 50% completeness limit in @xmath61 is slightly beyond 26 magnitudes , so we should be missing very few of these inactive red galaxies .",
    "few such objects are seen in deeper fields ( e.g. moustakas et al .",
    "1997 ) we note that our survey area is such that we only sample the field population and expect to detect few , if any , rich clusters .",
    "superimposed on the data in figure 2 are the loci of four evolutionary models spanning the @xmath62 range computed using the pegase.2 code ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) .",
    "note that virtually all objects to the left of the models are stars .",
    "with increasing redshift the colors initially become redder , but as the @xmath61 band begins to sample the rest uv part of the spectrum beyond @xmath63 it begins to brighten . the model that best matches the red galaxy population , an exponentially declining star formation rate with @xmath64gy , is the same model that reproduces the red counts shown in figure 1 . at the redshift of observation the star - formation rates are not insignificant , the rate being @xmath65 per @xmath15 , comparable to the star formation rates in the general field galaxy population at comparable redshifts .",
    "the @xmath44 defined red galaxies with the bluest @xmath4 colors are expected to lie at @xmath66 on the basis of this model .",
    "the photometric redshifts support this as shown by the significant number of @xmath67 objects in the lower right portion of the color - color plane",
    ".    0.3 cm      we have computed the angular correlation function of the red objects in our fields .",
    "the deepest and most complete data sets come from the hdfs and cdfs survey areas .",
    "the cdfs field covers 561 @xmath68 with an average 90% completeness @xmath0 depth of 20.5 , the hdfs field covers 847 @xmath68 to an average 90% completeness depth of 20.1 .",
    "we use the landy & szalay ( 1993 ) algorithm for estimating @xmath69 .",
    "uncertainties are computed from the differences between the two fields .",
    "we use the population of stars and faint blue galaxies as the random distribution . as a check we determined @xmath69 for a complete @xmath0-selected sample using a generated random sample and a completeness map for a sub - region of the hdfs field and recover a clustering angle of approximately @xmath70 .",
    "in figure 3 we display the angular correlation function for the full h - selected population and for the red galaxies in three apparent magnitude bins , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the correlation angles , @xmath74 , derived from fits to @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is assumed ) , are given in table  1 .",
    "the clustering shows very steep color and magnitude dependencies , allowing a strong test of the estimated redshift distribution and the spatial correlation length .",
    "there are two primary trends : the red galaxies are very much more correlated than the entire @xmath0 limited sample , and , the angular clustering increases much faster with decreasing limiting magnitude than can be expected on the basis of depth in a uniformly distributed population .",
    "the natural interpretation is that the red galaxies are distributed in a relatively narrow redshift shell around @xmath63 . in table  1",
    "we report the dependence of clustering on color in various sub - samples and find that the clustering increases for progressively redder sub - samples .",
    "we split the @xmath7 galaxies into sub - samples with red and blue rest - frame uv colors at @xmath77 , finding that both sub - samples have increased correlations compared to the whole , and hence occupy narrower redshift ranges .",
    "the red galaxy counts , colors , and angular clustering together allow us to infer their statistical distribution in redshift . here",
    "we present a simple population model approach using the evolving luminosity function as described in ",
    "2.2 .    to invert the @xmath74 into co - moving correlation length , @xmath78",
    ", we use the relativistic generalization of limber s equation for @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83^{1/2}$ ] , with @xmath84 . the co - moving distance , @xmath85 ,",
    "is computed for our adopted cosmology @xmath48 .",
    "we approximate the @xmath86 distributions with gaussians fit to the results of the population model discussed in   2.2 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "determinations of @xmath86 from our photometric redshifts in the cdfs field yield mean redshifts and characteristic widths for the @xmath32 and @xmath87 sub - samples quite close to those listed in table 1 .",
    "an additional constraint comes from redshifts for objects in similar color and magnitude ranges from the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey ( cohen et al .",
    "the cohen et al .",
    "sample is @xmath88 selected , but if we adopt @xmath89 for the red population , we can compare the redshift distribution of their @xmath90 sample .",
    "a red color cut yields @xmath91 , @xmath92 , a distribution somewhat narrower than that derived from the photometric redshifts , as expected .",
    "we use our population model to mitigate the small number statistics in the photometric redshifts , particularly for the reddest colors and brightest magnitudes .",
    "we adopt @xmath91 for the red galaxies , 0.9 for the @xmath93 range and 1.6 for the @xmath94 blue sub - sample of the @xmath44 red galaxies .",
    "the inferred co - moving correlation lengths , @xmath95 , are listed in table  1 .",
    "the correlation lengths increase as @xmath96 and have only a very weak dependence on the mean redshift . although these correlation lengths are large , they are comparable to those found for early - type galaxy populations at low redshifts ( davis & geller 1976 , guzzo et al .",
    "1997 , willmer , da costa & pellegrini 1998 ) .",
    "our larger inferred values of @xmath97 at high redshift compared to local early - types could be the result of an increasing biasing with redshift , as expected theoretically ( mo & white 1996 ) , or simply an overestimate of the width of the redshift distribution .",
    "we have identified a large sample of faint red galaxies from a 0.62 square degree area of the las campanas ir survey . while the present data set does not allow a direct constraint on the contribution from heavily reddening star forming galaxies , the counts , colors and clustering statistics of these galaxies are all consistent with their being a mildly evolved progenitor of the present day early - type field population .",
    "we find evidence for a modest change in the co - moving space density of early - type galaxies to @xmath13 .",
    "the star formation rates inferred from the rest - frame uv colors suggests that the objects are largely , but not completely , assembled by the epoch of observation .",
    "if the red galaxies are predominantly old stellar systems , their numbers are larger than predicted in galaxy evolution models with strong merging ( e. g. kauffmann & charlot 1998 , somerville et al 2001 ) . the use of a color selection that does not extend to the rest - frame uv allows us to recognize nearly - passively evolving objects with greater confidence than selections spanning large color baselines .    0.3 cm",
