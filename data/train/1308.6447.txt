    "developments in quantum mechanics lead to emergence of many new research areas including quantum cryptography@xcite , and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the goal of quantum information theory is to develop new technologies for information processing that will take us from the traditional classical information age into the age of quantum information .",
    "quantum key distribution @xcite , the most secure known way for sending secret messages , is a significant achievement in the field of cryptography .",
    "it s techniques allow alice and bob to establish a shared secret key using an insecure quantum channel and public communication .",
    "besides the validity of the laws of quantum physics , the security of all qkd schemes relies on some other assumptions .",
    "the foremost among them , always present in any such protocol , is that all parties concerned have secure laboratories , _",
    "i.e. _ , at no stage should there be a leakage of secure classical data from any laboratory .",
    "this assumption is crucial and can not be removed .",
    "another basic assumption is that all players have complete control over their own physical devices , _",
    "i.e. _ , they have full knowledge over what quantum system their apparatuses use and they also know the exact operation of their measuring devices , _ etc . _",
    "the goal of the device - independent @xcite analysis of quantum protocols is to eliminate the latter assumption , _ viz .",
    "_ players can distrust the source of particles and they can also distrust their measuring apparatuses as they might have been prepared by a malicious party .    in 2007 , acn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , introduced a device independent qkd protocol secure against collective attacks .",
    "earlier questions of a similar type were also addressed by several researchers in different contexts @xcite . in 2011 ,",
    "@xcite provided a more general security scheme based on causally independent measurement processes .",
    "the security of all these protocols is undermined as the measurement at any step may depend on the classical or quantum memory of all previous inputs and outputs . recently",
    "secure protocols where device re - use is allowed were introduced @xcite .    in all protocols mentioned above , the parties make measurements on entangled subsystems , check for a violation of some bell inequality to see if their outcomes are random from the eavesdropper s point of view and , if indeed they are , use them as their secret key . in this manuscript",
    "we present a family of protocols which are significantly different .",
    "the parties announce their _ outcomes _ and use their choices of measurement _ settings _ for key generation .",
    "our protocol shares this property with the non - device - independent prepare - and - measure sarg04@xcite .",
    "the potential benefit of flipping the roles of outcomes and settings is that the latter are chosen by the parties using their random number generators ( rngs ) , which are typically assumed to be perfect , while the former are obtained from measurements on the systems supplied by the eavesdropper .",
    "it was shown that even small imperfectness in rngs are a big threat to qkd @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that they are much a bigger threat to the protocols where the key is obtained from the outcomes than from the settings .",
    "more precisely , we take a standard device independent qkd and show that it can not be secure if the bias of rngs is greater than 0.1 while our protocol allows for positive key rates far beyond this point .",
    "this is the main motivation of our approach .",
    "obviously , the parties need a way to convince themselves that the correlations they share can not be classical .",
    "checking for a violation of a bell inequality is only one possible way of doing so .",
    "another option is to _ e.g. _ verify the so - called hardy s paradox @xcite . there ,",
    "more than a single security parameter is estimated , which gives the parties more knowledge about the correlations they share . in @xcite",
    "this approach has been used to improve the rate of certified randomness .",
    "the main result of this paper is the presentation of a protocol which remains secure , even if the source of randomness used by the parties is strongly biased .",
    "besides that , the protocol serves as a proof of principle that one can use the bits from private random number generators as a key for the device independent qkd .",
    "it is shown how a protocol with these properties can be constructed and how its security can be proven .",
    "these features may be exploited by some future protocols .",
    "we generalize the results of @xcite stating that a condition imposed on a single bell inequality may certify the randomness of the outcomes . here",
    "we consider the case when there are many parameters used , and the key is formed from the measurement settings with the outcomes made public .",
    "what is more , we show that this intrinsically many - valued estimation can be as simple to conduct experimentally , as the standard bell scenario .",
    "apart from proving the security of such protocols , we provide a way of using semi - definite programming relaxations to evaluate their key rates .",
    "we give explicit numerical results for a protocol basing on the original hardy s paradox .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows .",

    "[ sec : robustness ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the hardy s paradox@xcite , and describe a quantum key distribution protocol based on it .",
    "consider a physical system consisting of two subsystems shared between two distant parties .",
    "the two observers ( alice and bob ) have access to one subsystem each .",
    "both can choose one of two binary measurement settings labeled @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with outcomes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the settings are chosen at random in subsequent runs of the experiment .",
    "settings are denoted by letters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while outcomes by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for alice and bob respectively .",
    "the hardy - type argument starts with the following set of four joint probability conditions for two two - level systems : @xmath6 let us find the set of states @xmath7 for which the conditions of the hardy - type argument given in are satisfied for a given pair of observables .",
    "let us denote the eigenstates of the observable @xmath8 by @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath12 for the outcome @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "we now associate a product state with every condition in the test , say : @xmath13 let @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the last condition is due to the non - commutativity of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the subspace spanned by the three linearly independent states @xmath21 and @xmath22 given in . to satisfy the conditions given in , @xmath7 has to be confined to a subspace @xmath23 of @xmath24 , which is orthogonal to @xmath20 but not orthogonal to @xmath25 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath23 is one .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 must be an unique ( up to a local unitary ) pure two - qubit entangled state , which we denote @xmath26 .",
    "thus , _ no mixed state of two spin-1/2 particles will satisfy hardy s argument _",
    "it can also be shown that no two maximally entangled qubit states satisfy hardy s argument @xcite .",
    "the four product states @xmath27 are linearly independent , hence , by the gram - schmidt orthogonalization procedure , one can find an orthonormal basis @xmath28 , in which state @xmath29 is its last member : @xmath30    the probability @xmath31 in conditions , for the hardy state , @xmath26 , reads @xmath32 its maximum is @xmath33 for @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we consider a scenario in which two distant parties , alice and bob , want to generate a secure key .",
    "they are allowed to use public classical communication .",
    "the qkd protocol proceeds as follows :    * s1 . in the _ initial phase _ of the protocol ,",

    "alice randomly chooses whether to measure @xmath35 , or @xmath36 on each of her qubits .",
    "bob does the same by choosing randomly between measurements of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "parties repeat such measurements on all subsystems , and collect statistics . in each run , labeled by @xmath39 , they write down the chosen observables , @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , together with the obtained results , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . * s3 . _",
    "check for eavesdropping : _ for some randomly selected runs , alice and bob both announce their measurement choices ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and the corresponding outcomes ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "alice and bob publicly compare their announced measurement choices in order to estimate security parameters .",
    "for this reason this phase is called the _ estimation phase_. * s4 . for the remaining runs , alice and bob",
    "announce only their measurement outcomes , not their bases .",
    "next , to generate their key , they select only those runs for which both of them got outcome @xmath0 .",
    "( alice and bob ignore those unrevealed pairs that do not have outcomes on both sides equal to @xmath0 , so they are working on some subset of the states . ) * s5 . for each run with outcomes @xmath0 ,",
    "they assign a bit value according to their settings .",
    "+ if the pairs of entangled qubits emitted by the shared source are all perfect copies of the two - qubit ` hardy ' states @xmath26 given by eqs ( [ hardys2 ] ) the assigned bit values will be perfectly correlated due to ( [ hardy2q ] ) . that is , in the ideal case they generate the same key . in the noisy case , _ key reconciliation _ is required .",
    "device - independent approach allows to quantify all possible interventions of the eavesdropper .",
    "these may include influencing the internal working of the devices used by alice and bob , _",
    "e.g. _ by establishing any type of correlation , by coupling to the state , by emitting a different state , or by using measurement settings different from those specified by the protocol .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the ideal hardy test for maximum probability of success @xmath44 is fully device - independent @xcite - there is a unique quantum probability distribution associated with this value .",
    "the conditions assure that both parties got outcome @xmath0 only if they have chosen the same measurement basis .",
    "then we have @xmath45 for a given set of observables and the choice of observable on each side is fully random .",
    "the protocol is secure against the most general form of collective memory attacks .",
    "unfortunately this case requires perfect experimental data which is not possible to obtain in practice .",
    "the remaining part of this paper analyzes the noisy case .",
    "before we move to the detailed analysis of the protocol in the case with imperfect experimental data let us present the main motivation of this approach . to this end",
    "we will compare the robustness to compromised random number generators in our protocol and the standard one based on chsh inequality . in both cases we assume that the observed data corresponds to what an experimenter would expect from perfect states and devices .    a common assumption in qkd states that the source of randomness is perfect , meaning that settings are _ i.i.d .",

    "we consider the case in which the average probability distribution of the source of randomness is given by eq . , but in particular runs , the probability distribution is biased in a way known to eavesdropper . for the sake of simplicity we consider biases modeled by changing the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 to @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , for given @xmath53 , which gives four possible biased distributions , @xmath54 .",

    "it also explains the role of nonuniform distribution of settings .      in the perfect case with uniform distribution we have @xmath177 and @xmath178 , so @xmath179 .",
    "hence , the guessing probability for eve is higher than @xmath180 .",
    "the following dropping strategy makes the guessing probability equal to @xmath180 .    after performing her measurements",
    ", alice randomly selects only @xmath181 runs from the total runs with @xmath182 , where her measurement settings was @xmath36 ( in the perfect case , then also @xmath38 ) .",
    "alice sends the list of selected runs to bob via a public channel .    for this reduced list ( from which the key is generated ) of runs alice",
    "have equal number of @xmath0s and @xmath1s .",
    "( in the perfect case they correspond to the same values on the side of bob . )",
    "hence , the guessing probability is now exactly equal to @xmath180 .",
    "we have @xmath183 to get the actual ratio of runs that are contained in the key , this should be multiplied by @xmath184 thus the key rate is approximately @xmath185 .      instead of choosing measurement settings with equal probabilities , both alice and bob may choose the observables @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath37 ) and @xmath36 ( resp .",
    "@xmath38 ) with a ratio @xmath186 , for some @xmath187 .    let us denote for simplicity @xmath188 and @xmath189 . then to obtain guessing probability equal to @xmath180 , the condition for @xmath187 is    @xmath190",
    "@xmath191    the key rate is thus @xmath192 .    in the perfect case @xmath193 and @xmath194 , so the key rate is @xmath195 .",
    "the ratio is @xmath196 .",
    "our paper provides an example of an entirely new class of qkd protocols and provides tools for their analysis .",
    "we have presented a qkd protocol based on hardy s paradox and analyzed its security in both ideal and noisy scenarios .",
    "it has two novel features : ( a ) the bits used for the secret key do not come from the results of the measurements on an entangled state , but from the choices of settings which are more difficult for an eavesdropper to influence ; ( b ) instead of a single security parameter a set of them is used to estimate the level of trust in the secrecy of the key , or to construct a certifying observable .",
    "we have shown that these two properties were not chosen by accident .",
    "they both make the eavesdropping harder , leading to protocols which can produce a positive amount of shared key even if the biases of the source of randomness are strong . using more than a single parameter for security provides more information to the parties about the correlations that they share and puts more limits on the eavesdropping strategies .",

    "<S> we provide an analysis of a new family of device independent quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols with several novel features : ( a ) the bits used for the secret key do not come from the results of the measurements on an entangled state but from the choices of settings ; ( b ) instead of a single security parameter ( a violation of some bell inequality ) a set of them is used to estimate the level of trust in the secrecy of the key . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of these protocols is a smaller vulnerability to imperfect random number generators made possible by feature ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we prove the security and the robustness of such protocols . </S>",
    "<S> we show that using our method it is possible to construct a qkd protocol which retains its security even if the source of randomness used by communicating parties is strongly biased . as a proof of principle , </S>",
    "<S> an explicit example of a protocol based on the hardy s paradox is presented . moreover , in the noiseless case , the protocol is secure in a natural way against any type of memory attack , and thus allows to reuse the device in subsequent rounds . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse the robustness of the protocol using semi - definite programming methods . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present a post - processing method , and observe a paradoxical property that rejecting some random part of the private data can increase the key rate of the protocol . </S>"
