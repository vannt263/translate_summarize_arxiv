    "the model for the simulation of the dynamics of complex systems , known as _ dissipative particle dynamics _ ( dpd ) , has undergone an important development in recent years since it was introduced in 1992 by hoogerbrugge _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "this off - lattice simulation methodology is especially addressed at the modeling of the behavior of fluids at a scale where fluctuations are important .",
    "thus , the method is suitable for both the study of the dynamics of small systems and in situations dominated by brownian motion , for instance .",
    "the potential of this methodology was realized from the beginning and , as a consequence , dpd has already been applied to the study of the dynamics of systems of practical interest such as polymeric materials@xcite , polymer adsorption@xcite , colloidal suspensions@xcite , multicomponent systems@xcite , among others . despite the advances carried out towards a complete understanding of the features of this new methodology",
    ", there are still unclear aspects , mainly concerned with the large - scale transport properties of the model .",
    "the study of these properties , relative to the extended version of the dpd algorithm which includes heat transport@xcite , is the subject of this paper .    in the dpd model , an ensemble of particles , viewed as mesoscopic representations of _ flocks _ of physical molecules ,",
    "interact with each other through conservative as well as dissipative forces .",
    "random forces are also explicitly considered to maintain the particles in constant agitation even in the absence of external force fields . in this method ,",
    "the particle - particle interactions are such that the total momentum is conserved despite the presence of dissipative and random forces and , therefore , the macroscopic hydrodynamic behavior at long - wavelength and long - time scales is guaranteed .",
    "in addition , since the model is not defined on a lattice , it is galilean invariant and has no extra conservation laws apart from those that are physically relevant .",
    "together with the theoretical advantages , the dpd simulation methodology can be implemented using only local interactions , which makes it fast to run on a computer , as in lattice gas cellular automata@xcite , for instance .",
    "the original dpd method was only concerned with the conservation of the total momentum of the particles so that the model could reproduce continuity and navier - stokes equations at the macroscopic level .",
    "several refinements , such as to demand that the equilibrium momentum distribution of the particles be of the maxwell - boltzmann type@xcite , were added aiming at a closer relationship of the model with real physical systems .",
    "however , the energy transport and , therefore , the heat flow , could not be modeled since the dpd model was essentially _",
    "isothermal_.    an extention of the model to also incorporate the _ conservation of the total energy _ in the particle - particle interaction , has been proposed in ref.@xcite , and later in ref.@xcite .",
    "more recently , we have refined the original algorithm to ensure energy conservation at every time - step , instead of in the mean@xcite . in our version of the dpd model with energy conservation ( referred to as dpde from now on ) , together with the position and momentum , an internal energy of each particle is explicitly considered as a relevant variable . with the definition of a particle s internal energy , an energy balance can be established so that the work done by the dissipative and random forces is stored or released from the particle s internal energy , and thus the total energy is held constant in the particle - particle interaction .",
    "therefore , as a consequence , the addition of the energy conservation to the momentum conservation in the particle - particle interaction allows the dpde model to describe heat transport together with the momentum transport .",
    "hence , the five hydrodynamic fields , density , momenta and energy , issued from the conservation laws at a microscopic level , can be properly reproduced by the dpde model .    in this paper",
    "we address the study of the _ transport properties _ of the dpde model from both , theoretical as well as simulation points of view . in the case of the isothermal dpd",
    ", much work has been devoted to the analysis of the transport properties of the model , especially with regard to the calculation of the shear viscosity@xcite , towards a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the long - wavelength long - time dynamic behavior of the model .",
    "significant progress has been done in this direction by the formulation of boltzmann - type equations , which have been solved by means of different approximations .",
    "in particular , in ref.@xcite the transport equations for the macroscopic fields were derived and expressions for the transport coefficients were given , together with a lucid discussion of the conceptual implications of the approach . the authors distinguish a kinetic and a dissipative contribution to the shear viscosity , essentially proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , with @xmath4 being the friction coefficient per unit of mass of the particle - particle dissipative force , in that reference . roughly , the first one is due to the transport of momentum due to the random motion of the particles while the second is the contribution due to the direct frictional force between particles .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the viscosity coefficient was captured by the approach , but significant deviations between the simulation and the theoretical predictions were found .",
    "the disagreement was found to be more important in the region dominated by the kinetic contribution , although theoretical and simulation results seem to tend to agree in the limit where a given particle interacts with many others at one time .",
    "such a discrepancy has been further reported by the simulations of pagonabarraga et al.@xcite .",
    "however , very recently , the approximations used in the solution of the boltzmann - like equation of ref.@xcite have been reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "claim that the discrepancies between the theory of ref.@xcite and the simulations can be explained if the correlations between the collisions are taken into account .",
    "this is even more dramatic in the case that only a few particles are in simultaneous interaction with a given one .    for the dpde model , such a deep analysis of the transport phenomena displayed by the system is still lacking . in ref.@xcite we analyzed the equilibrium properties of the model from both the simulation and the theoretical perspectives .",
    "as far as the transport properties of the model are concerned , in ref.@xcite we derived , from simple arguments , expressions for the macroscopic thermal conductivity and the viscosity coefficients of the dpde model , in the limit where the dissipative interactions at the mesoscopic level are dominant .",
    "furthermore , we have shown figures with convection rolls and temperature profiles in a dpde system with cross temperature gradient and gravity field , proving qualitatively that the model displays the same features as expected for a fluid . however , simulation results on these transport coefficients is scarce",
    ". only data from a model with particles at rest exchanging heat to each other are available@xcite .    in the present paper , we do not attempt to derive a complete theoretical treatment of the transport properties of the dpde model , more complex to handle than the isothermal dpd model due to , first , a larger number of parameters , second , the couplings between the different macroscopic fields , and third , the dependence of the transport coefficients with respect to the temperature . instead , we propose a calculation of the complete set of the transport equations for the five hydrodynamic fields in the limit in which the _ local equilibrium _",
    "hypothesis is reasonable .",
    "such a procedure is well known for dissipative systems@xcite and has also been discussed in this context in ref.@xcite .",
    "this treatment permits us to derive transport equations for the hydrodynamic fields , and approximate expressions for the transport coefficients , valid in the region of parameters where dissipative contributions are dominant .",
    "we report simulation data on the thermal conductivity , characteristic of the dpde model , for different values of the parameter describing the direct heat transfer between particles , and for two values of the particle - particle interaction range . in all the cases",
    "studied , the system can be considered as _ non - dilute _ , in the sense that there are always many particles interacting with each other at one time .",
    "different behaviors are observed , varying with both , the magnitude of the dissipative coefficient , @xmath1 in our model , and the _ interaction number _ , @xmath5 that we define as the number of particles interacting at one time .",
    "we attempt a qualitative explanation of these different behaviors .",
    "finally , we also report simulation data of the viscosity of the dpde model as a function of the interaction range .",
    "the agreement between the simulation results and the theoretical predictions for the transport coefficients is good in the region dominated by the dissipative interaction , and for large interaction number , @xmath5 .",
    "we observe , however , significant deviations if the interaction number is decreased , regardless of the value of the dissipative coefficients .",
    "the theoretical explanation of this fact could be related to the recent analysis of ref.@xcite for the isothermal dpd model . in the low @xmath1 limit ,",
    "we observe a particular behavior that we relate to a form of transport due to particle diffusion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review of the algorithm describing the dpde model used in the simulations . in section 3",
    ", we perform the derivation of the transport equations , based on a local equilibrium formulation . in this section",
    "we give expressions of the transport coefficients and thermodynamic properties that are compared with those of ref.@xcite . in section 4 , we show the results obtained for the thermal conductivity from the simulations performed with the dpde model in different conditions , and compare with the theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , in section 5 we review and discuss the main results of this paper .",
    "the dpde model is defined from the stochastic differential equations for the updating of the relevant variables of the particles@xcite .",
    "this implies equations for the change in positions , @xmath6 , and momenta , @xmath7 , of all the particles , according to newton s equations of motion .",
    "these interactions include frictional and random forces due to the _ mesoscopic _ nature of the particles , issued from a coarse - grained picture of the physical system represented by the dpde model .",
    "in addition , the internal energies @xmath8 of the particles are also considered as relevant variables .",
    "the particle internal energy is necessary in this description to impose the conservation of the total energy in the particle - particle interaction , when dissipative and random forces exist . from a physical point of view , both the random interactions and the frictional forces , as well as the internal energy of the particles , arise due to the fact that the dpd particles may be thought of as if they were subsystems of a large number of degrees of freedom that are not explicitly taken into consideration in the simulation .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we have discussed at length the derivation , the properties and physical consistency of the algorithms defining the dpde model .",
    "the reader is addressed to that reference for the details .",
    "thus , let us consider the dynamics of the dpde model as that of an ensemble of @xmath9 particles interacting through conservative , dissipative and random interactions .",
    "let @xmath10 be the external force acting on the i@xmath11 particle , and @xmath12 , the particle - particle conservative force between the pair @xmath13 .",
    "the frictional force exerted by the @xmath14 particle on the @xmath15 one is given by @xmath16 which is directed along the vector @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , so that the total angular momentum is also conserved .",
    "@xmath20 is the particle - particle friction tensor , which is a function of the distance between the particles and also of the particles temperatures @xmath21 , defined later on , through the scalar friction coefficient @xmath22 .    as in the isothermal dpd model",
    ", we will also demand that the particles arrive at a given thermal equilibrium for the momenta , described by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "thus , together with the dissipative forces , we have to also introduce random _ brownian _ forces to compensate , on average , the loss of energy due to the frictional forces .",
    "these random forces are gaussian and white , and their amplitudes are obtained from a suitable fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite .",
    "as mentioned , the dissipative particles , as mesoscopic views of physical systems , bear a large number of internal degrees of freedom .",
    "we assume that these degrees of freedom relax fast towards a thermodynamic equilibrium characterized by the particles internal energy @xmath23 .",
    "this permits us to introduce a thermodynamic description at the particle level and thus define a particle s temperature , @xmath21 , as well as a particle s entropy , @xmath24 , related to the internal energy by a _",
    "particle s equation of state _",
    "@xmath25 dynamically , the @xmath15 mesoscopic particle varies its internal energy due to the work done by frictional and brownian forces on the other particles . however , we consider that it can also vary its internal energy by exchanging _",
    "mesoscopic heat _",
    ", @xmath26 , with the @xmath14 one , if they have different particle temperatures : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mesoscopic thermal conductivity .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) recalls the macroscopic fourier s law for heat transport , here defined at a mesoscopic level .",
    "therefore , the change of the internal energy of a given particle is due to both the mesoscopic heat exchange as well as to the work done by the dissipative forces .",
    "in addition , we demand that the internal energy be a fluctuating variable described by classical equilibrium statistical mechanics@xcite as that of a small system in contact with a heat bath . in our model ,",
    "the dynamics of such fluctuations is introduced through a random heat flow between the particles , @xmath29 , that satisfy a given fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite .",
    "the algorithm for the dpde model described so far is obtained after integration of the stochastic differential equations for the change in the relevant variables ( langevin - like equations ) in a small time step @xmath30 , and retaining terms up to first order@xcite . we have chosen an interpretation rule@xcite for these stochastic differential equations that is neither it nor stratonovich , but the resulting stochastic process satisfies _ detailed balance _",

    "again , the prime indicates that these amplitudes need to be calculated with their arguments evaluated at the advanced time . in eqs .",
    "( [ 21b ] ) and ( [ 21c ] ) we have introduced the random numbers @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which are gaussian and white , with correlations @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "these random numbers arise from the contributions due to the random forces and random heat flows , respectively . in ref.@xcite an explicit algorithm for the dpde model",
    "is also given .",
    "although the theoretical predictions are valid for any dpde model , for the simulations done in the present work , however , we have used the model defined by the following functions . for each particle",
    "we have used the equation of state @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a constant that stands for the heat capacity of a single particle .",
    "notice that it is convenient to choose @xmath49 to avoid negative values of the internal energy of the particle during the simulations .",
    "for the dissipative interactions we have chosen @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants giving the magnitude of the mesoscopic friction and thermal conductivity , respectively , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the respective ranges of these dissipative interactions .",
    "note that @xmath55 explicitly depends on the particles temperatures . here , no potential interaction forces are considered .    despite the multiple parameters that the algorithm given in eqs .",

    "dimensionless we have defined a temperature of reference @xmath59 to be used as the scale of temperature .",
    "thus , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where the asterisk is used to denote a dimensionless variable from now on .",

    "the characteristic scale of time is the relaxation time for the particle s momentum , that is @xmath66 .",
    "the characteristic scale for the particle s internal energy is chosen to be @xmath67 so that @xmath68 . in summary ,",
    "when these dimensionless variables are introduced into the algorithm , the equation for the momentum and the position remarkably contains no parameters ( in the absence of conservative interactions ) , and only depends on the dimensionless range of the frictional force @xmath69 . in turn , the equation of the energy is such that the terms related to the mechanical energy dissipation are proportional to @xmath57 , while the particle - particle heat transport is proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , the equation is also functionally dependent on the ranges @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the model described so far has a hydrodynamic behavior at long - wavelengths and long - times , according to the conservation laws introduced in the particle - particle interaction . in this section",
    "we will derive the macroscopic transport equations of the model in the local equilibrium approximation , in order to relate the model parameters with transport coefficients and thermodynamic relations .",
    "such a procedure yields the dominant contribution of the transport coefficients in the case in which the dissipative interactions are large , so that the kinetic transport is subdominant . under these conditions , we can expect the system to relax fast to the local equilibrium probability distribution function for the set of variables describing the state of the system , i.e. @xmath71 we have used the shorthand notation @xmath72 , @xmath73 to indicate the macroscopic velocity and temperature fields , respectively , at the space points occupied by the i@xmath11 particle . furthermore ,",

    "corrections to this probability distribution are essentially proportional to @xmath77 and to @xmath78 , and are neglected in this approach@xcite .",
    "let us consider a single component system and ignore external fields for simplicity .",
    "the particle number density is described by the field in the phase space @xmath79 where here the average must be taken by means of the instantaneous non - equilibrium probability distribution , that we will approximate by eq .",

    "we have explicitly written its dependence with respect to @xmath89 due to the interparticle potential , together with the @xmath90 and @xmath91-dependence due to the possible spatial variation of the temperature field occuring in eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "it is important to realize that @xmath92 is invariant under the exchange @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , in eq .",
    "( [ 26 ] ) we have introduced the energy - averaged friction coefficient , resulting from a possible temperature dependence in the mesoscopic friction @xmath2 , according to @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a normalization factor . since all the pairs of particles",
    "are equivalent , we have dropped the subscript @xmath13 on the left hand side of this last equation .",
    "again , the explicit @xmath90 and @xmath91-dependences come from the spatial variation of the macroscopic temperature field and is also invariant under the exchange @xmath96 by construction of @xmath2 . to obtain the long - wavelength behavior of eq .",

    "we thus expand the @xmath100 dependence of the velocity , temperature and the density fields in powers of @xmath89 , up to the first significant order .",

    "( [ 29 ] ) is formally identical to that obtained from thermodynamic considerations for a physical system with pair interaction potentials@xcite .",

    ". the volume viscosity is obtained from the coefficient of the @xmath108-term , and reads @xmath109 both viscosity coefficients agree with the dominant contribution of the transport coefficients given in ref.@xcite , in the limit of negligible kinetic momentum transport . here , however , these viscosity coefficients can be functions of the temperature through @xmath98 due to the possible dependence of @xmath2 on the particles temperatures .",
    "note that neither kinetic nor particle - particle interaction potential contributions are significant to the momentum transport coefficients in the large friction limit developed here .",

    "the second and third terms are , respectively , a change in the internal energy due to the work due to an expansion of the fluid , and the viscous heating of the system due to viscous forces . from the fourth and last term we can define the _ macroscopic heat flow _",

    "although the theoretical approach developed here is only applicable to the large friction limit , we end this section by including a qualitative evaluation of the kinetic contributions to the thermal conductivity , to enable a comparison with the simulation data .",
    "effectively , we can estimate the time @xmath131 taken by a particle to loose the memory of its initial momentum as being given by @xmath132 as follows from a balance between @xmath133 and the force given in eq .",
    "( [ 1a ] ) , times the number of particles inside the interaction range , @xmath134 .",
    "since the particles have an average velocity @xmath135 , we can estimate the momentum penetration depth as @xmath136 on the other hand , we can also estimate the characteristic relaxation time for the internal energy of a given particle ( much larger than the kinetic energy since we assume that @xmath49 ) from a balance between @xmath137 and the mesoscopic heat flow , according to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) this leads to @xmath138 where we have also considered that @xmath139 particles are simulatenously interacting . hence , if @xmath140 the particle covers a distance @xmath141 given by @xmath142 in the time the energy is dissipated .",
    "thus , if @xmath143 , the energy transport is dominated by the dissipative contribution and the energy is delivered before the momentum has relaxed . thus , the contribution to the energy flow due to the motion of the particles is given by@xcite @xmath144 therefore , in the region dominated by the dissipative interactions , the kinetic contribution to the thermal conductivity is subdominant and has the functional form @xmath145 notice that @xmath146 scales as @xmath147 , according to our initial assumption .",

    "clearly , in this region the energy transport is dominated by the kinetic contribution , which is much more effective than the direct transmission of heat between the particles .",
    "it is crucial to realize , however , that the flow of particles is dominated by its diffusive motion instead of the inertial motion of the previous domain , since the momentum has had time to relax .",
    "the characteristic relaxation time is still given by eq .",
    "( [ 45c ] ) , since the mechanism for energy delivery keeps on being the direct heat transport between particles .",
    "however , @xmath141 is calculated from the mean displacement of a brownian particle , that is @xmath150 where the diffusion coefficient has been estimated from a stokes - einstein relation @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the characteristic velocity of this diffusive flow is @xmath152 , from which we obtain the energy flow in this regime @xmath153 hence , from this expression we infer the kinetic contribution to thermal conductivity which , in addition , will be the leading contribution in this region @xmath154 the preceeding reasoning leads to a resulting thermal conductivity independent of the parameter @xmath52 in the region where the dissipative contribution to the thermal conductivity is small . in this respect , this new result is essentially different from that reported for the viscosity coefficient in the isothermal dpd model@xcite .",
    "the particular system used to investigate the transport properties of the dpde model consists of @xmath155 particles in a cubic box of periodic boundary conditions in all three dimensions , so that no walls are considered .",
    "the lateral size of the box has been set to @xmath156 in dimensionless units , and hence the number density @xmath157 is always unity .",
    "we have studied essentially dense systems , in the sense that many particles interact with each other at one time , and therefore , the interaction ranges are larger than @xmath158 .",
    "the choice of @xmath159 also implies that the momentum penetration depth is smaller than , or of the order of , the mean distance between particles .    before taking any measurment ,",
    "the system is allowed to reach thermal equilibrium . according to the expressions given in eqs .",
    "( [ 30 ] ) and ( [ 35e ] ) , and the form chosen in eqs .",
    "( [ 14c ] ) and ( [ 14d ] ) for the dissipative coefficients , the predicted values of the thermal conductivity and the shear viscosity are , respectively @xmath160 notice the resulting temperature dependence on the thermal conductivity , which arises from the dependence of the mesoscopic thermal conductivity on the particles temperatures .",
    "the measurement of the transport properties in the system has been carried out by tracking the relaxation of perturbations externally induced in the system .",
    "the hydrodynamic behavior predicted for the dpde system in the preceeding section suggests that small perturbations should relax according to linearised versions of eqs.([24 ] ) , ( [ 28 ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) .",
    "in particular , one finds that a given fourier component of wavevector @xmath161 of a temperature perturbation field in the system should relax as @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the thermal diffusivity , with @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the constant volume heat capacity per particle ( related to the value given in eq .",
    "( 3.22 ) of ref.@xcite according to @xmath166 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath167 , due to the contribution of the energy stored in other degrees of freedom different from the internal energy of the particle .",
    "superposed to this relaxation there is also the effect of the temperature fluctuations induced by the random forces and random heats .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath57 , the amplitude of the random temperature fluctuations is very small and , thus , can be ignored .",
    "we have obtained the relaxation of temperature fluctuations , @xmath168 , as the difference between perturbations in the internal energy density @xmath169 , externally induced in the system at @xmath170 , and @xmath171 , which are the directly observable variables . to obtain the value of the thermal conductivity , we have fitted an exponential decay to the curves obtained in each simulation . for all the simulations dominated by the dissipative contribution",
    ", we get clear exponential decays , with regression coefficients typically of @xmath172 or higher , and error bars for the measured exponent of about 1% of its value . in the region dominated by the kinetic contribution ,",
    "slight deviations from a purely exponential decay are observed .",
    "however , correlation coefficients typically of @xmath173 and @xmath174 are still found , and the error is about 10% .",
    "the measured values for the thermal conductivity as given by means of the procedure described above have been compared with those obtained from the application of a temperature gradient to the system and measuring the resulting heat flow through the system once the steady state was reached .",
    "the results obtained by both methods are in agreement .",
    "we have performed two series of measuremets of the thermal conductivity for two different radii @xmath54 . the interaction number is then given by @xmath175 we have plotted the results for @xmath176 against the dimensionless parameter @xmath177 , for values of @xmath178 ranging from @xmath179 to @xmath180 , thus covering three decades of this parameter .",
    "the results are then compared with the theoretical prediction , given in eq .",
    "( [ 40 ] ) , that reads @xmath181 in dimensionless form .",
    "the dimensionless temperature was about @xmath182 and the density was unity .",
    "the range of the interaction @xmath70 was set to @xmath183 and @xmath184 , so that the interaction number was @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless shear viscosity coefficient takes the form @xmath187 according to our set of dimensionless variables , the viscosity coefficient depends only on the density and interaction range and , hence , is constant for each set of simulations characterized by a given value of @xmath5 .",
    "we have measured a viscosity coefficient @xmath188 for the case @xmath189 and @xmath190 for @xmath186 .",
    "we set the parameter @xmath57 to @xmath191 to avoid negative values of the energy during the simulation for large @xmath58 values .",
    "likewise , the time - step was chosen to be @xmath192 or @xmath193 in the critical cases regarding the possibility of negative values of the particles energy .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot our results for the thermal conductivity as a function of the parameter @xmath178 . for both values of @xmath5 we observe a linear dependence of @xmath194 in this parameter , for values of @xmath178 larger than @xmath195 , which roughly corresponds to the point at which the thermal conductivity is about @xmath179 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the dissipative contribution dominates the thermal conductivity in this region , and that the dependence in @xmath178 is well captured by eq .",
    "( [ 43 ] ) .",
    "in addition , for the case @xmath196 , we find a much better agreement between the theoretical predictions and the simulation results than in the case @xmath185 , whose value is roughly half of the theoretical one in all of the range .",
    "this is a rather unexpected result which is caused neither by the particle number fluctuations in the sample nor by significant deviations of @xmath197 from @xmath179 , as we have checked . such a behavior is equally independent of the way of measuring the property , since good agreement has been found between the data obtained from both the relaxation method and heat flow in a temperature gradient .",
    "furthermore , data reported in ref.@xcite for a system of frozen dpde particles also show the same kind of dependence of the thermal conductivity with @xmath5 , so that it can not be attributed to a possible coupling between energy and momentum transport .",
    "this effect has no equivalent in the case of the viscosity coefficient which , in our dimensionless variables , varies only with the range of the interaction @xmath69 at constant @xmath157 .    in fig .",
    "2 we focus our attention on the range @xmath198 , so that the dissipative contribution to the thermal conductivity is subdominant .",
    "we plot the results for the two series of data ( @xmath189 and @xmath186 ) as a function of the parameter @xmath199 , to compare with the prediction given in eq .",
    "( [ 45f ] ) .",
    "both series of data agree with a thermal conductivity independent of @xmath52 ( @xmath58 in dimensionless variables ) in this range of values of @xmath52 .",
    "although the data are less reliable than in the previous range , we can consider that the behavior given in eq .",
    "( [ 46c ] ) is confirmed and that the transport of energy for small @xmath52 is due to particle diffusion .",
    "we should point out , however , that the data with @xmath189 show an increase of the thermal conductivity in passing from the dissipative regime to the diffusive regime , while the data for @xmath186 shows a smooth crossover .",
    "this can attributed to the fact that for @xmath189 the crossover between both regimes passes first through the behavior described in eq .",
    "( [ 45f ] ) . in the @xmath186 case ,",
    "the dissipative and diffusive regimes simply overlap in the crossover .    to end this section ,",
    "we report data on the shear viscosity coefficient obtained for the model . according to our choice of parameters ,",
    "the shear viscosity is only a function of the range of interaction @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we have performed simulations and plotted in fig .",
    "3 the viscosity coefficient as a function of the parameter @xmath200 .",
    "as expected , we obtain a good agreement between the theoretical prediction given in eq .",
    "( [ 44 ] ) for values of the parameter @xmath201 larger than @xmath202 , which roughly corresponds to a viscosity @xmath203 . in this region , however , a slight curvature can be observed . for values of @xmath201",
    "smaller than @xmath204 , as is to be expected , the momentum transport is dominated by kinetic effects . here",
    ", we observe the same kind of qualitative behavior as found for the isothermal dpd model as has been discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the transport properties of the new dpde model from both , a simple theoretical approach and computer simulations .",
    "this model is addressed at the simulation of fluctuating fluids in which momentum as well as heat transport are involved , and has already shown well defined equilibrium properties@xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the model is _ complete _ in the sense that it is thermodynamically consistent and the five hydrodynamic fields can be correctly described . the complete understanding of its features and the refinement of its capabilities , however , still demands a great deal of additional effort .    after a brief review of the algorithm",
    ", we have first of all derived the dynamic properties of the dpde model based on a local equilibrium assumption . in this framework , we have obtained the transport equations and approximate expressions for the transport coefficients which here can be functions of the temperature . in this approach , it is implicitly assumed that an initial probability distribution for the relevant variables of the system will relax to the local equilibrium form after a time @xmath131 for the momentum and @xmath205 for the energy , according to eqs .",
    "( [ 45 ] ) and ( [ 45c ] ) , respectively .",
    "these characteristic times must be much smaller than those related to the changes in the hydrodynamic fields for the whole approach to be valid .",
    "we have qualitatively argued that the local equilibrium is the dominant contribution in an expansion in inverse powers of the dissipative coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath51 , so that the transport coefficients can be expressed as series expansions of this particular form .",
    "this is also the case in the derivation of the smoluchowski equation from the fokker - planck equation@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the range of validity of this point of view , the kinetic contributions are always subdominant .",
    "the analytic form for these subdominant kinetic contributions has been reported in the literature@xcite in the case of the viscosity , and are given in eq .",
    "( [ 45f ] ) in the case of the thermal conductivity .",
    "second , we have also studied the behavior of the system when the dissipative contribution becomes comparable or even smaller than the kinetic contribution to the dissipative coefficients . in this regime , the theoretical picture based on the local equilibrium assumption fails .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that the form of the series expansion of the transport coefficients in inverse powers of @xmath52 and @xmath51 will change towards another functional dependence .",
    "this is in fact one of the more important findings of this paper which also applies in the case of viscosity in the isothermal dpd model . in the case of the thermal conductivity",
    "we have found that the thermal conductivity at small values of @xmath52 should be driven by particle diffusion , according to eq .",
    "( [ 46c ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath0 is independent of @xmath52 and that the simulations performed seem to agree with this interpretation .",
    "thus , the increase of the thermal conductivity at small values of @xmath52 is attributed to a crossover from the regime dominated by the dissipative interactions to a regime dominated by diffusive transport .",
    "this crossover region depends on the interaction number @xmath5 .",
    "third , we have shown the first simulation results for both , the shear viscosity coefficient and the thermal conductivity for the dpde model .",
    "qualitatively , the shear viscosity for the dpde behaves in the same way as that of the isothermal dpd model , as could have been expected .",
    "furthermore , we have explored different parameter regions that cover only part of all the possibilities of the dpde model .",
    "particular attention has been paid to non - dilute systems , aiming at a reliable comparison between the simulation data and the theoretical results in the large friction limit .",
    "we have also reported results in regions where the theoretical assumptions fail and new qualitative behaviors have been found for the thermal conductivity .",
    "fourth and last , an important result of our simulation analysis is the difference ( of about a factor of two between the two series of data ) observed in the thermal conductivity , in the region of large @xmath52 , for the two values of the interaction number analyzed .",
    "we find no qualitative explanation for this difference , which becomes larger as the number of particles inside the interaction range diminishes .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy could be the same as that found for the viscosity in the isothermal dpd model , according to ref.@xcite .",
    "the fact that the cpu time grows with the interaction number , makes the regime of small @xmath5 be of great interest by itself .",
