    ". the area of the region increases with increasing ratio @xmath92 .",
    "\\(iv ) finally for the combination @xmath93 , there is no region of exclusion and the whole phase space is available .",
    "this is a qualitatively description that can be complemented by a quantitative analysis shown in fig .",
    "[ excl1 ] .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to choices of @xmath77 that lead to two regions of exclusion in the phase space of the system .    in fig.[orbitv ] we illustrate how the areas of exclusion and trajectories evolve if we fix the value of @xmath44 and increase the potential .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ orbitv ] corroborates the information given in fig .",
    "[ excl1 ] . more specifically , setting @xmath94",
    ", we verify that up to @xmath95 there is only one region of exclusion , however , a second region appears above this value .",

    "let us now look at a specific example in the context of a realistic varying potential .",
    "we assume that the field is initially @xmath97 and does not go any further than @xmath98 .",
    "again we choose @xmath94 . from fig .",
    "[ sol1 ] we have that for such a value of @xmath44 , the maximum value of @xmath45 allowed by the kinetic constraint is @xmath99 . for a quadratic potential @xmath100 with @xmath101",

    "one around the instantaneous critical point and the second between the critical points corresponding to @xmath103 and @xmath106",
    ". we can understand this behavior by returning to fig .",
    "[ excl1 ] .",
    "the evolution starts at @xmath107 and develops along the line @xmath94 .",
    "as the potential increases , a second region of exclusion is generated at the position of the critical point when @xmath108 .",
    "this region increases as the value of the potential increases .",
    "in fact , it can become as large as the orbit of the trajectory , in which case , by the definition of the regions of exclusion , @xmath109 .",
    "this means that the field has reached the point of maximum displacement and turns around .",
    "the potential decreases and so does the area of the bounded region of exclusion .",
    "once the field passes through zero and changes sign , the evolution mimics the evolution on the opposite side of the potential i.e. the field enters a cyclic regime .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that , in some cases , as the potential increases , an exclusion region appears in the phase space which can cause the field to loose all its kinetic energy and therefore to turn around in the potential , however , in a regime of static solutions @xmath47 , not in an accelerated expansion , @xmath110 , as required for inflation .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ excl1 ] , we see that provided @xmath111 , no second region is formed .",
    "the upper bound corresponds to the value of @xmath44 above which @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( [ kinetic ] ) changes sign , or in other words , is the lowest value of @xmath44 for which the corresponding solid line and dashed line ( like the ones in fig .",
    "[ sol1 ] ) do not touch at @xmath113 .",
    "hence , the area of parameter space @xmath111 , allows in principle , a smooth transition between a regime where the field is being pushed up the potential to a phase where this solution becomes unstable and the field slow rolls back down the potential thus making the universe to inflate in the very same spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this article",
    "we are primarily interested in those situations in which the background fluid is initially dominating the evolution of the universe , and the curvature term is important only at the values of the scale factor where the bounces occur . more specifically , neglecting the contribution of the scalar field , we require at the bounces @xmath114 ( or equivalently @xmath115 ) , which leads to the constraint @xmath116 this equation has two real roots ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) provided @xmath119 .",
    "it is important to stress that this value lies outside the bound @xmath120 that avoids the generation of a second exclusion region .",
    "this means that _ it is not trivial to implement a mechanism akin to the one discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite when a dominant background fluid is present_. in fact , we can only expect a transition from an oscillating universe into an inflationary one by admitting that the amplitudes of the oscillations of the scale factor are sufficiently large such that the trajectories in the phase space touch the separatrix ( where the trajectories appear to intersect ) before the diameter of the second exclusion region equals the diameter of the trajectory .    what is therefore the correct values of initial parameters that deliver the desired evolution",
    "? admitting that initially the evolution starts with @xmath103 and @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the field turns around in the potential to slow roll back down in the last cycle , very near when the two exclusion regions merge , one has @xmath123 . further admitting that @xmath124 and defining the useful quantity @xmath125 that relates the kinetic energy of the field to the energy density of the background , using eq .",
    "( [ weq1 ] ) and requiring @xmath126 we find that @xmath127 it is concluded that the ratio of kinetic energy to the background s energy density is bound from below by a quantity that is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "more specifically , we realize that it increases for increasing @xmath105 . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ weq1 ] ) when @xmath117 ( @xmath128 ) increases , @xmath44 decreases , and fig .",
    "[ excl1 ] , implies that @xmath129 increases .",
    "for example , if @xmath130 , the two region of exclusion merge for @xmath131 which results into the limit @xmath132 .",
    "it is however worth pointing out that if @xmath105 is small the consistency condition @xmath133 is violated as can be seen from fig .",
    "this constraint simply states that the hubble radius must be larger than the limiting scale of the theory . on the other hand , for large @xmath105",
    ", the ratio @xmath134 becomes close to unity meaning that the contribution of the field must be important .    in the remainder of this paper we deal with an alternative mechanism where the energy density of the scalar field , though initially subdominant , builds its way up during the numerous cycles of oscillation of the universe until it becomes dominant delivering an accelerated expansion .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ rhos ] an example of such an evolution .",
    "the example yields only a few @xmath135-folds of inflation , for illustrative purposes , but as we shall see below , there are regions of parameter space that provide a successful inflationary scenario with more than @xmath136 @xmath135-folds of expansion .",
    "the evolution of the field starts in the semi - classical phase , @xmath137 , at the bottom of the potential with a kinetic energy that is twenty orders of magnitude smaller than the energy density of the background fluid .",
    "the anti - frictional term in the equation of motion of the scalar field accelerates the field up the potential as the universe expands .",
    "the energy density of the field evolves with an effective equation of state @xmath138 . once in the classical phase ( @xmath139 )",
    "this term turns into a frictional component forcing the field to slow down .",
    "the equation of state , therefore , approaches @xmath140 . in the case of fig .",
    "[ rhos ] , the field s kinetic energy decreases below the potential energy at @xmath141 and comes to a stand and turns around in the potential ( @xmath142 ) when @xmath143 ( indexes `` @xmath144 '' and `` @xmath145 '' stand for `` freeze '' and `` turn around '' , respectively ) . on the way down the potential",
    ", the field gains again kinetic energy which is enhanced once the universe recollapses ( as in the classical phase the frictional term becomes anti - frictional when the hubble ratio is negative ) .",
    "the field is again slowed down as soon as the scale factor enters the semi - classical phase during the collapse . when the kinetic energy becomes smaller than the potential , the equation of state again approaches @xmath146 . in this example , the kinetic energy decreases but it does not vanishes in the semi - classical phase ; hence , when the universe goes through the bounce starting a new cycle , the field keeps moving in the same direction .",
    "the subsequent evolution follows closely the previous description for a number of oscillations of the universe .",
    "the remarkable feature about the evolution is that the field gains energy on each cycle thus allowing it to be displaced by a larger amount from one cycle to the next .",
    "when the contribution of the energy density of the field becomes important , the field can slow roll and the universe naturally starts an inflationary evolution say , in a `` graceful entrance '' .",
    "at this point we need to establish which set of the parameter space leads to a viable model of inflation rather than to an infinite series of oscillations of the universe .",
    "let us start by calculating by how much the scalar field is displaced in half a cycle of the universe .",
    "we assume that the initial value of the scale factor is deep into the semi - classical phase and that the potential is initially negligible . from the equation of motion of the scalar field , neglecting the contribution of the potential , we obtain @xmath147 using @xmath148 ( this is obviously not true at the bounces but it is a good approximation within the extremes of the scale factor ) and integrating one gets @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 correspond to the value of the field and @xmath55 when the field freezes in the potential , respectively . to perform this integration we have considered two epochs of evolution . in the semi - classical phase , between @xmath152 and @xmath153 the function @xmath154 takes the asymptotic form @xmath155 . in the classical phase , when @xmath156 we take @xmath24 . the quantity @xmath153 is defined as the value of the scale factor where @xmath157 .",
    "we can estimate the value of @xmath151 by using the expression @xmath158 which follows from using the first integral of the equation of motion of the field along with the asymptotic form @xmath159 .",
    "furthermore , a freezing point can only be identified provided the potential becomes at least as large as the kinetic energy , such that , @xmath160 , for a quadratic potential .",

    "( [ defrv ] ) we get @xmath165 , hence we expect @xmath150 to become independent of @xmath9 for small values of this parameter .",
    "a necessary condition for the field to turn around is that @xmath166 , i.e. , it must freeze before the universe recollapses .",

    ".    this condition might not be sufficient to guaranty that the field stops and reverses its direction , as the kinetic energy can decrease below the value of the potential but without vanishing . in this latter case",
    "the field keeps moving up the potential in a series of steps before the turn around occurs ( such cases were discussed in the first part of section [ graceful ] , an example is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ expl1 ] , and do not result into an inflationary expansion , as we have seen ) .",
    "understandably , @xmath167 must be a fraction of the value of @xmath168 . by numerically integrating the equations of motion",

    "more specifically , we have evolved the system up to @xmath176 , i.e. until the scale factor is one e - fold larger than its maximum value at the bounces , when the background fluid is dominant . we have assumed a quadratic potential @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "figures [ phimax ] and [ h2max ] show the maximum value of the field and the maximum value of the hubble ratio , respectively , with respect to the quantization parameter @xmath9 . in all cases ,",
    "the evolution starts from @xmath97 .",
    "important information can immediately be extracted from these figures .",

    "we note , however , that by increasing @xmath105 the maximum achieved value of @xmath12 decreases , as it is seen by comparing the middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "( [ phimax ] ) .",
    "a remarkable feature about these figures is that they present a tooth wood saw bladelike structure for low @xmath9 values .",

    "this means that in a universe where @xmath9 is large , the field freezes and consequently starts rolling down when the scale factor is smaller than in a universe with low @xmath9 .",
    "the field is accelerated during the expansion phase between @xmath183 and @xmath118 ( even though the @xmath184 term in the equation of motion is a frictional one ) , during the collapse between @xmath118 and @xmath185 , and again during the expansionary phase when @xmath186 .",
    "but since the field starts moving earlier in a universe for larger @xmath9 , the net effect is that it is pushed further up the potential in this case .",

    "this explains why the maximum value of the field increases with increasing @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ phimax ] .",
    "the reason why the maximum value of the field suddenly drops by increasing @xmath9 is understood by realizing that for a critical value @xmath187 there is one less cycle than if @xmath188 , thus preventing the field to move as high in the potential .",
    "as we keep increasing @xmath9 , the description made above follows , now with one less cycle of expansion and recollapse .",
    "along the same lines , a similar oscillatory structure is expected by varying @xmath134 .",

    "this behavior translates into a similar effect of the one of having a slightly smaller @xmath9 , i.e. the ratio of energy densities from one cycle to the next is smaller than expected had the potential energy remained always dominant . as @xmath9 becomes even larger , the field is able to perform a few oscillations around the value at the minimum of the potential before the collapse occurs . to summarize ,",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath9 is compensated by the fact that the field loses most of its potential energy , thus the number of cycles of the universe before the field becomes dominant does not decrease anymore as @xmath9 is increased .",
    "in this article we have looked upon the dynamics of a scalar field evolving in a closed universe where a background fluid is present in the context of loop quantum cosmology . in the first part we have searched for static solutions of the system and evaluated their stability admitting a constant potential . we have discovered that , for a constant value of @xmath193 and @xmath9 , as the potential is increased , a second region of exclusion ( where the kinetic energy is negative ) is generated in the phase space .",
    "we argued that the occurrence of such a region makes it difficult to implement a similar mechanism to the one studied in refs .",
    "@xcite where the field moves up the potential in a series of steps resulting from the cyclic expanding and contracting phases of the universe .",
    "a viable model requires the phase space trajectories of the system to be sufficiently away from the critical point in order to avoid the exclusion region since its area grows as the potential increases .",
    "this requirement translates into a lower limit on the initial value of the kinetic energy of the field and is defined in the region below the curve labeled @xmath170 in fig .",
    "[ jmin ] .    in the second part of this work",
    "we have shown examples of an alternative mechanism which is defined when @xmath170 .",
    "qualitatively , it means that the field turns around on each cycle .",
    "the kinetic energy gained when the field is rolling down the potential in the expansionary phase , is enhanced during the collapse pushing the field fasrther up the potential on each cycle .",
    "the energy density of the field comes eventually to dominate the curvature and background contributions establishing the initial conditions for inflation .",
    "we have seen that there are values of @xmath9 for which the maximum value of the field is above three planck units , thus able to provide a viable inflationary evolution .",
    "it is nonetheless observed that it is very easy to violate the hubble bound @xmath133 .",
    "this problem significantly constraints the range of parameter space for which one obtains a viable result within the limits of validity of the theory .",
    "moreover , it involves large values of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "large values of the parameter @xmath9 are considered to be unnatural @xcite .",
    "also worth pointing out that the mechanism can only be implemented for potentials with a minimum .    in this work we have neglected discreteness corrections .",
    "this approach is valid as long as @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "admitting that the maximum value of @xmath195 occurs near @xmath0 , we obtain that @xmath196 . using the approximation that the maximum of the background energy density occurs when",
    "@xmath113 with @xmath24 , we get the equivalent condition @xmath197 . from eq .",
    "( [ weq1 ] ) we can further extract a constraint on the minimum value of @xmath105 : @xmath198 more specifically , @xmath199 for @xmath67 , independently of the value of @xmath9 .",
    "this bound , only involving orders of magnitude , is more stringent than the heuristic consistency condition used so far in the literature , @xmath133 .",
    "it also suggests that it is very difficult to move the field as far as @xmath200 unless the initial kinetic energy of the field is at least comparable to the energy density of the background fluid",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate how the dynamics and bounds get modified once the discreteness corrections are taken into account .    finally we would like to keep in mind that the oscillations of the field may induce the conversion of part of its energy density into radiation thereby modifying the background s contribution in the process .",
    "the picture is therefore more complex than the one we dealt with here and deserves further study .",
