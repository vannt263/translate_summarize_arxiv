    "heavy fermions exhibit a number of interesting ground states with anomalous low - temperature properties @xcite .",
    "these include paramagnetic heavy - fermion states down to the lowest temperatures ( e.g.  cecu@xmath10 , ceal@xmath11 , ceru@xmath12si@xmath12 , ybagcu@xmath13 , and ybincu@xmath13 ) , magnetically ordered states with small ordering temperatures and reduced moments ( e.g.  uru@xmath12si@xmath12 , ceal@xmath12 ) , and unconventional superconducting states ( e.g.  cecu@xmath12si@xmath12 , ube@xmath14 , upt@xmath11 ) .",
    "this anomalous behavior is mostly attributed to the strong correlations between the electrons in the localized or weakly - itinerant @xmath15 states of the rare - earth ( or actinide ) ions .",
    "the natural starting point for understanding this peculiar behavior is the periodic anderson model or , when charge fluctuations are negligible , its low - energy counterpart , the kondo lattice model .",
    "these models are fairly well understood in one dimension where extensive calculations , based on exact diagonalization@xcite and density matrix renormalization group@xcite techniques are available .",
    "however , it is not clear how much of the insight gained is relevant to real - life three - dimensional heavy fermions .",
    "the gutzwiller approximation , that can be applied in any dimension , has yielded some information on various correlated lattice models@xcite , particularly for ground - state properties .",
    "the development of a non - perturbative approximation scheme , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , has recently enabled a more comprehensive investigation of correlated lattice models , and particularly of their dynamic properties @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply this technique to the kondo lattice model in order to investigate ( i ) the relevant low - energy scales of the model and how these appear in the single - particle and magnetic excitation spectra , and ( ii ) the temperature dependence of the @xmath15-electron spectra for the interpretation of the low - energy photoemission spectra ( pes ) of paramagnetic heavy - fermion compounds , of current experimental interest@xcite .    the @xmath15-level photoemission and inverse photoemission spectra ( ipes ) of heavy fermions measure , respectively , the single - particle removal and addition spectrum for @xmath15 electrons .",
    "they provide information on the electronic structure of heavy fermions , including the energies of the relevant @xmath15-level configurations , their spin - orbit splittings , and the size of the screened coulomb interaction between the @xmath15 electrons .",
    "in addition to this information about the `` high - energy '' scales ( the smallest of these being the spin - orbit splitting @xmath16  ev ) , the @xmath15-level spectrum contains also information about low - energy scales associated with correlations and lattice coherence .",
    "identifying these is one of the aims of the present study of the kondo lattice model .",
    "we shall not deal , here , with the `` high - energy '' part of the spectra of heavy fermions , which is well accounted for by an anderson impurity model ( aim ) approach @xcite .",
    "instead , we shall focus our attention on the low - energy spectrum , which is the part most strongly influenced by lattice coherence effects , especially at low temperatures .",
    "these effects should emerge most clearly in the kondo lattice model , which addresses specifically the low - energy scale , neglecting the complications associated with the high - energy atomic - like features .",
    "although single - impurity model approaches also make predictions for the low - energy spectrum , there is no a priori reason to expect these to be quantitatively or even qualitatively correct .",
    "a lattice model calculation is therefore required to quantify the extent to which aim calculations apply .    in the absence of detailed lattice - model calculations ,",
    "the experimental results for the low - energy spectra of heavy fermions have , nevertheless , been discussed within the aim approach .",
    "two specific predictions of this approach concern the magnitude of the temperature dependence of the near-@xmath17 feature ( kondo resonance ) in the spectra , and the scaling of the intensity of this feature with the kondo scale .",
    "broad agreement with aim predictions is claimed by some groups@xcite whereas others@xcite dispute the interpretation in terms of the aim .",
    "the reader is referred to the reviews ref .  , and to ref .",
    ", for some recent aspects of this controversy . in the context of this discussion , these experiments address a very important issue , namely the temperature dependence of the low - energy spectra and the appropriate theoretical framework for interpreting them .",
    "we shall attempt to clarify this issue by calculating the temperature dependence of the lattice kondo resonance and comparing this with the predictions of the impurity models and with experimental spectra .",
    "experimental studies of this temperature dependence at temperatures both above and below the relevant kondo scale are technically difficult , and so far have only been carried out on a few systems , for example on ybagcu@xmath13@xcite , ybal@xmath11@xcite , and more recently on ybincu@xmath13@xcite and uru@xmath12si@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "most other studies have only compared spectra at two temperatures , typically room temperature and at one low temperature comparable to the kondo scale : this is not sufficient for an unambiguous testing of model predictions with experiment , but can at most indicate agreement with predicted trends . hence , it is important for a detailed comparison with theory for more experiments of the former type to be carried out",

    "the self - consistency procedure involves : ( i ) guessing an initial form for the effective medium @xmath41 , ( ii ) diagonalizing ( [ eq : km ] ) with the nrg and solving for its dynamics , ( iii ) re - calculating the effective medium by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc - dmft ] ) .",

    "in addition to the condition ( [ eq : sc - dmft ] ) on the green s functions , we also fix the number of electrons @xmath42 in the conduction band , by adjusting the chemical potential @xmath43 at each iteration , until @xmath42 converges to the desired value .",

    "this improves agreement for the two highest temperatures , but phonon broadening is not the main source of temperature dependence in the spectrum , which is instead the temperature dependence of the kondo resonance in the spectral function @xmath49 .",
    "the experimental spectra are consistent with this interpretation , because they show a loss in intensity of the near-@xmath17 feature as the temperature is increased from 50  k to 150  k : this agrees with the loss in spectral weight of the kondo resonance with increasing temperature , and can not be attributed to phonon broadening , which conserves the total spectral weight .",

    "the curves are normalized so that the lowest - temperature peak heights in theory and experiment agree .",
    "this normalization gives agreement between theory and experiment for the tails and peak heights at all temperatures .",

    "thermal broadening of the spectral function @xmath49 in @xmath130 , will shift the intensity peak to lower energies with increasing temperature , as observed in the calculations .",

    "that part of the spectrum has much weaker temperature dependence , it reflects the non - lorenzian tail of the kondo resonance and it is the safest to use in case there are extrinsic ( non - kondo ) temperature dependences close to @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast to the case of ybincu@xmath9 , we do not obtain agreement for both the tails and the peak height of the intensity as a function of temperature .",
    "we conclude that these early data , although indicating a kondo effect in the temperature dependence of the spectrum close to the fermi level , are not fully consistent with our model . to investigate the origin of the discrepancy between theory and experiment , it would be interesting to repeat such experiments , particularly on single crystals as for ybincu@xmath9@xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the temperature dependence of the single - particle spectral densities of the kondo lattice model and their evolution with band filling within dynamical mean field theory .",

    "<S> the lattice kondo resonance is split into a main branch , which is pinned at the fermi level , and whose width is set by @xmath4 , and an upper branch at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the weight of the upper branch decreases rapidly away from @xmath6 and vanishes for @xmath7 ( however , the pseudogap in the conduction electron spectral density persists for all @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> on increasing temperature , we find that the lattice kondo resonance vanishes on a temperature scale of order @xmath8 , the same scale over which the single - ion kondo resonance vanishes in impurity model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to impurity model calculations , however , we find that the position of the lattice kondo resonance depends strongly on temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the results are used to make predictions on the temperature dependence of the low - energy photoemission spectrum of metallic heavy fermions and doped kondo insulators . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results for the photoemission spectra with available high - resolution measurements on ybincu@xmath9 and ybagcu@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the loss in intensity with increasing temperature , and the asymmetric lineshape of the low - energy spectra are well accounted for by our simplified @xmath0 kondo lattice model . </S>",
