    "one of the most puzzling properties of glass - forming liquids is the huge increase of viscosity , by many orders of magnitude , within a narrow range of temperature @xmath0 upon approaching the glass transition temperature @xmath1 . as a consequence ,",
    "considerable interest is being devoted to understanding this phenomenon in terms of the underlying atomic - level structure and dynamics of supercooled liquids  @xcite .    for many decades , practically all experimental measurements of viscosity or relaxation time as a function of @xmath0 upon cooling towards the glass transition @xmath1 , have been fitted with the vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) relation  @xcite .",
    "this empirical formula , with three fitting parameters , can capture the exponential or faster - than - exponential increase of viscosity on cooling of practically all cooperative liquids , something that physical theories have struggled to predict on a microscopic basis .",
    "mode - coupling theory predicts a power - law increase of viscosity , whereas entropy - based theories such as adam - gibbs and random - first - order are relatively successful in capturing the exponential @xcite trend using activation concepts .",
    "they involve growing length - scales and moreover can produce predictions of the different steepness of viscosity as a function of temperature  @xcite . an extended temperature - volume version of this model was formulated  @xcite , which predicts the fragility parameter @xmath2 for systems with different composition .",
    "as shown by angell  @xcite , while some systems ( strong glass formers ) have a viscosity which follows an arrhenius @xmath3 dependence on @xmath0 , other systems ( fragile glass formers ) have a much steeper super - exponential dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "various attempts have been reported to formulate physical models that can explain this fundamental observation in terms of the underlying microstructure , dynamics and interaction picture .",
    "+ in spite of these efforts , the vft relation still lacks a microscopic derivation and most available closed - form expression for the viscosity are semi - empirical extensions of vft where some parameter is given a tentative physical meaning in terms of a dynamical or structural parameter  @xcite .",
    "+ recently , a different approach has been proposed  @xcite , which combines the shoving model of the glass transition  @xcite with the atomic theory of elasticity  @xcite .",
    "there exists experimental support for both the shoving model  @xcite and the adams - gibbs conjecture  @xcite .",
    "the contributions of the adam - gibbs mechanism is , however , not enough to explain the behavior of the fragility , it has to be complemented with the effect of anharmonicity  @xcite . applying the shoving model and the adding the anharmonic effects to describe the fragility of glass - forming liquids is the focus of the present approach .    in the shoving model of the glass transition  @xcite ,",
    "the relaxation time is an arrhenius function of @xmath0 where the activation energy is provided by the local rigidity of the cage . in other words",
    ", it is the energy needed to break and mobilize the cage for a particle to escape , according to the original idea of eyring  @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 is the high - frequency shear modulus which describes the rigidity of the glassy cage . within this approach it is possible to make a step further and",
    "use the atomic theory of elasticity to relate the shear modulus @xmath5 to the average number @xmath6 of mechanically - active interatomic connections per atom , @xmath7 for the high - frequency affine modulus .",
    "clearly , if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are relatively insensitive to any change in @xmath0 , the relaxation time and the viscosity are a simple arrhenius function of @xmath0 , which works well for strong glasses . in the opposite scenario , @xmath6 may be a strong function of @xmath0 because of thermal expansion : if the attractive part of the interatomic potential is shallow , atoms leaving the cage encounter little resistance , hence the viscosity drops dramatically upon increasing @xmath0 and one recovers the fragile - glass limit .",
    "here we apply these ideas to two key systems : real metallic glasses on one hand , and lennard - jones model glasses , on the other .",
    "the analysis of these systems is much revealing : it is possible to fully disentangle the contributions of different segments of the interatomic potential ( repulsive and attractive ) to the viscosity and fragility .",
    "this outcome is of utmost importance for developing rational guidelines in the design of glassy materials with tunable mechanical and viscoelastic properties . in our recent work",
    "@xcite , an analytical model is proposed that describes the elasticity , viscosity and fragility of metallic glasses in relation to their atomic - level structure and the effective interatomic interaction . the model , which has only one adjustable parameter ( the characteristic atomic volume for high - frequency cage deformation ) is tested against new experimental data from md simulations of zrcu alloys and provides an excellent one - parameter description of the viscosity down to the glass transition temperature .",
    "+ we also consider the widely - used lennard - jones ( lj ) potential defined as : @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the depth of the minimum and @xmath10 is the position of the energy minimum along the radial coordinate @xmath11 . in this formulation ,",
    "the lj potential is a very versatile model system in which the anharmonicity can be varied by tuning the values of power - law exponents @xmath12 .",
    "lj potentials with different anharmonicity as given by different values of the pair @xmath12 are plotted in fig.1b .",
    "this potential has been extensively used in numerical simulations starting with the pioneering work of kob and andersen to make binary mixtures that undergo glass transition upon decreasing the temperature .",
    "the influence of attractive forces in lj systems has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was concluded that a variation of attractive intermolecular forces have only a small influence of the static structure of the lj glass , but may drastically alter the dynamical relaxation behavior , i.e. the viscosity or relaxation time .",
    "anharmonicity in this model system can be quantified in various ways .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , anharmonicity was quantified by the radial distance @xmath13 at which @xmath14 . in the older literature , a different measure of anharmonicity is given by the cubic coefficient @xmath15 in the taylor expansion of the potential about the minimum .",

    "+ hence , a direct relationship exists between the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath17 and the attractive anharmonic tail of the potential , as quantified by either @xmath13 or @xmath18 . in the same way",
    ", a similarly global parameter @xmath19 represents the effect of the repulsive part of the potential , as depicted in fig.1 ( a ) and is directly related to the short - range ascending slope of the radial distribution function @xmath20 through the following simple power - law expression  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the ion core diameter .",
    "the complex relationship between these two interaction parameters and its impact on viscosity and fragility is explored and disentangled in the following .",
    "we study the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath23 for a number of metallic glass - formers , on one hand , and for lj systems with varying power - law exponent pairs , on the other , in a comparative framework .",
    "the proposed interatomic potential of our recent work has been applied to experimental data of metallic alloys ( see appendix a ) . in some cases , @xmath19 could be extracted from experimental data of @xmath20 , whereas in other cases it has been fitted to the viscosity data . in the fitting of metallic glass data using our proposed interatomic potential ,",
    "the values of @xmath1 and @xmath17 were taken from the literature . hence , using those fittings , it is possible to analyse the interrelation between @xmath19 and @xmath23 , and the impact thereof on the fragility @xmath2 .    for the model lj systems , instead , we use the simulation data of bordat et al .",

    "in addition to that , the product @xmath60 follows an empirical power - law @xmath61 . upon inserting this into the expression for @xmath2",
    ", we thus obtain the scaling relation @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that , for model lj systems , a softer interatomic repulsion is linked to more fragile glass - former .",
    "this is the opposite to what is observed in soft repulsive colloids and in metallic glasses , where `` soft atoms / particles make strong glass - formers '' .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in the lj systems studied , the increase in anharmonicity in the attractive part of the potential ( which sets the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath17 ) goes hand in hand with softer short - ranged repulsion by construction .",
    "this is indeed reflected in the fact that @xmath17 is a decreasing function of @xmath19 .",
    "let us now consider the situation with metallic glasses . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we have plotted values of @xmath23 ( @xmath17 is the linear thermal expansion coefficient ) of various real metallic glasses taken from the experimental literature , as a function of the corresponding @xmath19 values obtained in ref.@xcite by fitting experimental viscosity data with eq .",

    "the situation in both cases looks as follows : there is no appreciable trend and @xmath23 appears to be muss less dependent on @xmath19 as in the lj case . in particular , @xmath23 varies very little over a comparatively much larger @xmath19-interval , within a band of @xmath63 of its average value @xmath64 , in the case of the real metallic glasses .",
    "this behavior has been observed experimentally for a wide range of different bulk metallic glasses  @xcite . in the second case of the cuzr binary alloy of varying composition it varies as @xmath65 around its average value @xmath66 .    in the case of lj ,",
    "instead , we had not only a clear decreasing trend , but also a larger variation in @xmath37 , by more than a factor of @xmath67 , over a comparatively much narrower @xmath19 interval .",
    "hence , we can set approximately @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) ( see appendix ) for the case of metallic glasses , which gives @xmath69 for the fragility .",
    "this clearly explains that `` soft atoms make strong glasses '' in the case of metallic glasses , because the product of the thermal expansion coefficient and the glass transition temperature in this case is practically independent of the interatomic repulsion .",
    "this is a very subtle but important point and a deep insight into our understanding of glasses .",
    "let us now consider what are the consequences for the fragility , by looking at the plots of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath19 and as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the two classes of systems , respectively . in fig .",
    "4(a ) , main panel , we plotted the fragility as a function of @xmath19 for the lj systems .",
    "as discussed above , in this case @xmath2 is a decreasing function of @xmath19 , even though @xmath2 increases with increasing @xmath70 , because @xmath37 is a nonlinearly decreasing function of @xmath19 .",
    "hence , according to our expression for the fragility , @xmath72 $ ] , derived in the appendix , the overall dependence of @xmath2 is that it decreases in the order @xmath73 .    in fig .",
    "4(b ) , main panel , we plotted the fragility as a function of @xmath19 for the metallic glasses . as anticipated , here we have the opposite trend : `` soft atoms make strong glasses '' , and the fragility increases upon increasing the repulsion steepness @xmath19 .",
    "however , let us look also at the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath74 : it appears to be qualitatively the same dependence seen for the lj systems , i.e. the fragility increases with increasing the product of the thermal expansion coefficient and the glass transition temperature , @xmath75 , but the trend is comparatively less pronounced for the same reasons mentioned in the context of fig .",
    "hence , we have shown that the fragility of the glass - formers investigated here under isobaric conditions is an increasing function of the product of the thermal expansion coefficient and the glass transition temperature , which is directly related to the _ attractive _ anharmonicity for the model lj glass - formers .",
    "the situation , however , is different for the repulsion steepness ( and its inverse , the softness ) . in lj systems , by construction , the repulsion steepness decreases upon increasing the attractive anharmonicity , and the fragility is a decreasing function or the repulsion steepness parameter @xmath19 because @xmath76 is a stronger - than - linear decreasing function of @xmath19 in the fragility formula ( eq.(6 ) appendix a ) .",
    "hence , the overall dependence of the fragility @xmath2 on the repulsion steepness is strongly influenced by the strong dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath19 .",
    "for metallic glasses , the situation is reverse : @xmath74 is basically independent of @xmath19 .",
    "hence the overall dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath19 in this case is of direct proportionality as given by the expression for @xmath2 quoted above ( eq .",
    "( 6 ) in the appendix ) .    in physical terms",
    ", this analysis clarifies that an increased fragility is associated with larger values of the product @xmath71 , which implies larger atomic mobilities at the level of third and 4th neighbours  @xcite , and the ability of the system to rearrange into more stable local configurations upon decreasing @xmath0 . at the same time",
    ", however , the fragility also increases upon increasing the short - range repulsion steepness , because this implies a steeper @xmath0-dependence of the local cage rigidity encoded in the high - frequency shear modulus @xmath5 .",
    "this , in turn , is controlled by the local coordination number @xmath6 and hence by the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath6  @xcite , which is a function of the repulsion steepness @xmath19 . the conceptual framework developed here",
    "thus mechanistically explains the apparent contradiction in the recent literature ( that `` soft atoms make strong glasses '' for metals  @xcite and colloids  @xcite , whereas `` soft atoms make fragile glasses '' , for lj systems  @xcite ) in terms of the underlying interaction physics .",
    "this framework will prove useful to achieve a rational design of mechanical properties of metallic glasses and other amorphous advanced materials .    the support of the eu through vitrimettech itn network fp7-people-2013-itn-607080 and fg 1394p1 is thankfully acknowledged .",
    "in recent work  @xcite , we analysed several amorphous metallic alloys in an attempt to extract an effective , averaged interatomic potential which describes the short - range repulsion between any two ions in a metallic alloy melt .",
    "based on the systematic fitting of shear modulus and viscosity data for various three- and 5-component alloys we proposed the following interatomic potential which comprises two contributions : ( i ) the longer - ranged thomas - fermi ( screened - coulomb ) repulsion modulated by the ashcroft correction and ( ii ) the born - mayer closed - shell repulsion due essentially to pauli repulsion .",
    "@xmath77 where @xmath78    the thomas - fermi contribution is more long - ranged and is described by a yukawa - potential type expression .",
    "the born - mayer contribution is a simple exponentially - decaying function of the core - core separation , motivated by the radial decay of electron wavefunctions for the closed shells .",
    "the effective ( average ) interatomic potential for two atoms in a metallic glass or melt is schematically depicted in fig.1 of the main article .",
    "we also consider the standard lennard - jones potential defined as : @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the depth of the minimum and @xmath10 is the position of the energy minimum along the radial coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "anharmonicity in this model system can be quantified in various ways .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , anharmonicity was quantified by the radial distance @xmath13 at which @xmath14 . in the old literature , a different measure of anharmonicity is given by the cubic coefficient @xmath15 in the taylor expansion of the potential about the minimum .",
    "classical arguments by y. frenkel show that the linear thermal expansion coefficient is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "hence , a direct relationship exists between the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath17 and the attractive anharmonic tail of the potential , as quantified by either @xmath13 or @xmath18 .",
    "the next step , is to find a similarly global parameter like @xmath17 to represent the effect of the repulsive part of the potential .",
    "this can achieved as follows .",
    "a simple parametrization of the short - range repulsive part of the interatomic potential is obtained by fitting the repulsive ascending part of the radial distribution function @xmath20 to a power - law : @xmath79 , where @xmath22 corresponds to the soft - core diameter of the atoms .",
    "this fitting is valid between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where we approximate the maximum of the first peak of @xmath20 with the minimum @xmath10 of the pair potential . upon inverting the boltzmann relation @xmath82",
    ", the potential of mean - force @xmath83 is obtained directly from @xmath20 .",
    "the potential of mean - force @xmath83 reduces to the pair potential @xmath84 only in the limit of zero density of particles ( ideal gas limit ) . at the high density of supercooled liquids",
    ", @xmath83 crucially contains many - body effects and represents the effective interaction between two particles mediated by the motions of all other particles in the liquid  @xcite . at short range , however , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are very similar and both dominated by the repulsive part of the interaction ( they both diverge as @xmath85 ) .",
    "since we are looking for a global repulsion parameter , analogous to @xmath17 for the attraction , it is important to work with @xmath83 rather than @xmath84 .",
    "hence , we can obtain an estimate of the repulsive part of the potential of mean force using @xmath86 where @xmath19 comes from a power - law fitting of @xmath20 up to the maximum of the first peak as described above and in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the next step , is to find a way to connect the shear modulus @xmath5 , which enters the shoving model , to the global interaction parameters , @xmath19 and @xmath17 .",
    "the high - frequency ( affine ) shear modulus can be written using lattice dynamics as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is some average ( snapshot ) distance between two nearest - neighbour atoms in the equilibrated supercooled liquid , @xmath89 is the harmonic spring constant ( i.e. the curvature of the main energy minimum in fig.1 ) , and @xmath90 is the atomic packing fraction .    using the fact that the upper integration limit of @xmath91 increases with the packing fraction @xmath90 , integrating the @xmath20 up to a threshold which is proportional to @xmath90 , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , yields the scaling law @xmath92 .",
    "although the upper limit of the integral could be perhaps identified with @xmath93 , since we are interested here in the qualitative behaviour we prefer to leave it as a generic threshold @xmath94 such that the limit @xmath95 is correctly recovered when @xmath96 .",

    "<S> within the shoving model of the glass transition , the relaxation time and the viscosity are related to the local cage rigidity . </S>",

    "<S> we applied this approach to both real metallic glass - formers and model lennard - jones glasses . </S>",
    "<S> the main outcome of this analysis is that in metallic glasses the thermal expansion contribution is mostly independent of composition and is uncorrelated with the interatomic repulsion : as a consequence , the fragility increases upon increasing the interatomic repulsion steepness . in the lennard - jones glasses , </S>",
    "<S> the scenario is opposite : thermal expansion and interatomic repulsion contributions are strongly correlated , and the fragility decreases upon increasing the repulsion steepness . </S>",
    "<S> this framework allows one to tell apart systems where `` soft atoms make strong glasses '' from those where , instead , `` soft atoms make fragile glasses '' . hence , it opens up the way for the rational , atomistic tuning of the fragility and viscosity of widely different glass - forming materials all the way from strong to fragile . </S>"
