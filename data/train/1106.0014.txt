    "recently , michtchenko and rodrguez ( 2011 ) have purposed a new method for a qualitative study of the planet migration originated by a generic dissipative mechanism .",
    "it has been shown that , under assumption that the dissipation processes are sufficiently slow , the evolutionary routes of migrating planets in the phase space are traced by stationary solutions of the conservative secular problem .",
    "therefore , the modeling of planet migration consists in the calculation of families composed by mode i and mode ii stationary solutions , parameterized by the mass ratio , for all possible values of planetary semi - major axes and orbital angular momentum of the system .",
    "it is presently accepted that the main mechanisms responsible for planet migration are the star - planet ( and planet - satellite ) tidal interactions and gravitational interactions of a planet with a gaseous disc .",
    "dissipative interactions remove ( or add ) orbital energy from the planetary system , producing changes of semi - major axes . in the case of tidal interactions , orbital energy is transformed into thermal energy , which is dissipated in the interior of the tidally deformed body .",
    "migration of the system can be either toward or outward the central body , depending on the properties of the tidal interactions and some parameters such as love numbers and quality factors ( darwin 1880 ; jeffreys 1961 ; goldreich and soter 1966 ; hut 1981 ; dobbs - dixon et al . 2004 ; ferraz - mello et al .",
    "2008 ) . during disc - planet interactions ,",
    "orbital energy is exchanged with a surrounding gaseous protoplanetary disc and , generally , the planetary orbital decay occurs ( for a review , see armitage 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , migration can also occur through gravitational scattering between planets and a remnant planetesimal debris ( e.g. fernndez and ip 1984 ; kirsh 2009 ) .",
    "dissipative forces also alter the orbital angular momentum of the system .",
    "indeed , tidal torques modify the rotational angular momenta of the interacting bodies , which are transferred to the orbits of planets or satellites ( e.g. mignard 1979 ; correia et al .",
    "2008 ) . during disc - planet interactions",
    ", the angular momentum is exchanged through gravitational torques between the planets and the disc ( e.g. lin et al .",
    "1996 ; goldreich and sari 2003 ; masset et al .",
    "2006 ) . in michtchenko and rodrguez ( 2011 )",
    ", we have purposed a generic approach to describe the exchange of the orbital angular momentum of the system during migration .",
    "we have introduced the orbital angular momentum leakage , defined as a portion @xmath0 of the orbital angular momentum variation produced by migration ( i.e. expansion or shrinkage of the planetary orbits ) , which is extracted ( or added to ) from the planet system .    in this paper , we show that each physical process is characterized by a specific law of orbital angular momentum leakage . we show that @xmath0 is a function of the eccentricity of the planet affected by the dissipative force .",
    "moreover , we show that @xmath0 also depends on a set of physical parameters related to planets , star and disc .",
    "finally , owning the characteristic @xmath0-function , we construct the evolutionary routes of the system for each specific mechanism driving the planet migration .",
    "this approach provides us with a general idea of how the system could evolve under a variety of migration conditions and physical models .",
    "in section 2 we briefly introduce some basic aspects of the secular dynamics of two - planet systems evolving under dissipative forces .",
    "section 3 addresses tidal interactions , where we include the cases of a close - in planet and a satellite interacting with their parent star and planet , respectively . migration driven by disc - planet interaction is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the dissipation is modeled through a drag stokes - like force .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we consider a three - body system consisting of a central star with mass @xmath1 and two coplanar planets with masses @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the system is far away from any mean - motion resonance .",
    "hereafter , the indices @xmath4 stand for the inner and outer planets , respectively .    in the astrocentric reference frame ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the system is given , up to second order in masses , as @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are planetary semi - major axes and eccentricities , and @xmath9 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the migration of planets is originated by dissipative forces which affect the energy and the orbital angular momentum of the planets and results in variations of their semi - major axes and eccentricities .",
    "if dissipation is sufficiently slow ( its rate is smaller than the proper frequency of the secular motion ) , the long - term variations of the orbital elements can be separated into two components : one is produced by secular interactions with the companion and the other is due to external interactions .",
    "hence , we can write    @xmath10    @xmath11    where the indices  sec \" and  ext \" stand for secular and external contributions of the total variation of each element .",
    "the secular theory provides that @xmath12 ( to first order in masses ) and , as a consequence , @xmath13 .",
    "we stress that , since we are studying the secular evolution of the system , short - period variations of the orbital elements ( of the order of orbital periods ) are omitted in the analysis .",
    "thus , equations ( [ aidot])-([eidot ] ) should be considered as the averaged equations describing the long - term variations of semi - major axes and eccentricities .",
    "in addition , the contribution of resonant terms is also neglected .",
    "assuming that the planetary masses are unaltered during migration , the time variations of @xmath14 , in terms of the time variation of the planetary semi - major axes , @xmath15 , and eccentricities , @xmath16 , is written as @xmath17    the total angular momentum of the whole system ( including the three - body system under study and the external component ) is conserved during migration .",
    "thus , we can write that @xmath18 , where the external component of the total angular momentum is denoted as @xmath19 . it should be emphasized that the generic definition ",
    "ext \" does not necessarily mean that the exchange of the orbital angular momentum occurs with an exterior medium .",
    "for instance , in the case of tidal interactions of planets with a central star , the ` external ' contribution to the angular momentum comes from the rotation of the star , as described in the next section . on the other hand , in the case of disc - planet interactions ,",
    "there is a flux of angular momentum between the planet system and an external protoplanetary disc , as described in section [ sec-3 ] .    for sake of simplicity",
    ", we restrict our investigation to the case in which only one planet is directly affected by dissipative forces and , consequently , its semi - major axis is changed .",
    "this implies that the semi - major axis of the other planet remains unchanged during secular evolution of the system . assuming that the @xmath20-body is affected by dissipative forces and combining equations ( [ aidot ] )  ( [ lorbdot ] )",
    ", we use the conservation of the total angular momentum to find that @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "equation ( [ e1esecdot ] ) shows that , under mutual secular perturbations , the eccentricities of the planetary orbits oscillate in anti - phase .",
    "equation ( [ e1esecdot ] ) also shows that the evolution of @xmath25 depends implicitly on the migrating evolution of the companion , through the external variations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "equation ( [ e1extdot ] ) can be re - written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the partial angular momentum of the body affected by dissipation .",
    "the function @xmath0 can thus be used as a convenient measure of the non - conservation of @xmath14 , since it quantifies the variation of the external component of the orbital angular momentum of the system . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath29 , @xmath19 remains constant and @xmath14 is conserved during migration . according to equation ( [ e1extdot2 ] ) ,",
    "the limit case @xmath30 implies that @xmath31 for @xmath29 , that is , the migration must be stopped when the planet orbit is circularized in the system with no exchange of angular momentum .    for @xmath32 ,",
    "the portion @xmath33 of the @xmath14-change produced by @xmath15 is absorbed by the system through the variation of @xmath8 , while the rest ( @xmath0 ) is transferred to @xmath19 .",
    "we say that there is a leakage ( or gain ) of the orbital angular momentum in the system .",
    "according to equation ( [ e1extdot2 ] ) , for @xmath34 , the dissipative force produces no change of the eccentricity and the change in @xmath14 due to @xmath15 is totally transferred to @xmath19 .",
    "this particular case of the angular momentum exchange was used to modeling of planet - planetesimal interactions ( malhotra 1995 ) .",
    "the range of theoretical values of @xmath0 is large ; according to equation ( [ alpha0 ] ) , @xmath0 can be positive or negative , depending on the signs of @xmath15 and @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 is a function of the orbital elements of the migrating planet and , consequently , varies during migration . knowing that each physical process is characterized by a specific law of angular momentum exchange , in the next sections",
    ", we develop the @xmath0-function for several kinds of dissipative interactions . using equation ( [ e1extdot2 ] )",
    ", we write @xmath0 in general form as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a characteristic function of the migration process , defined through the condition @xmath38 where the vector @xmath39 is composed of physical parameters of the process under study .",
    "as shown in michtchenko and rodrguez ( 2011 ) , under assumption that dissipation is weak and slow , the evolutionary routes of the migrating non resonant planets are traced by the mode i and mode ii stationary solutions of the conservative secular problem ( see also hadjidemetriou and voyatzis 2010 ) . the ultimate convergence and the evolution of the system along one of these secular modes of motion",
    "are determined by the condition that the dissipation rate is smaller than the proper secular frequency of the system .",
    "we have shown that , for values of @xmath0 less than 1 , the mode i secular solution ( characterized by aligned orbits ) plays a role of an attractive center when planetary orbits diverge and the condition @xmath40 is satisfied , or , when planetary orbits converge and @xmath41 .",
    "in opposite cases , the mode ii ( characterized by anti - aligned orbits ) is the attractive center of the migrating two - planet system .    in practice",
    ", the calculation of evolutionary tracks is simple .",
    "the current location of the system in the phase space provides the starting values of the orbital angular momentum , @xmath14 , and the semi - major axis @xmath7 of the planet directly affected by dissipation .",
    "the set , composed by @xmath14 , masses and semi - major axes , uniquely defines two stationary solutions ( @xmath42 ) of the conservative secular problem at the current configuration . in order to model migration process",
    ", the semi - major axes of the affected planet is incremented by @xmath43 ( which can be either positive or negative ) , while the semi - major axis of the other planet is kept unaltered .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the system is then corrected by the amount @xmath44 where the function @xmath0 is defined by equation ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "for a new set of @xmath7 and @xmath14 values ( with fixed masses ) , we calculate new values of stationary solutions , ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the system reaches domains with no possible stationary solutions .",
    "the obtained values of ( @xmath42 ) are then plotted on the representative planes ( @xmath45 , @xmath8 ) , where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) are mean motions of the planets .",
    "the family of stationary solutions shows two evolutionary routes , one of which the system will follow during migration .    in the described above process",
    ", stationary solutions can be calculated using the precise semi - analytical approach developed in michtchenko and malhotra ( 2004 ) , with no restrictions on the values of planet eccentricities .",
    "an alternative is the use of the expansion of the disturbing function in series of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , given by @xmath51where @xmath52 are numerical coefficients which do not depend on the physical and orbital parameters of the system and @xmath53 is the difference of planetary longitudes of pericenter .",
    "the main difficulty in the calculation of migration routes is that the characteristic function @xmath54 , which is needed to obtain @xmath0 through equation ( [ alpha ] ) , is unknown a priory .",
    "thus , the next sections of this paper will be devoted to calculate the function @xmath55 for some specific dissipative processes .",
    "we first consider the case of tidal interactions , which affect orbital elements and rotations of the deformed bodies , while energy is dissipated due to internal friction .",
    "the tidal force is inversely proportional to the @xmath56 power of the distance between interacting bodies and is effective in both planetary and satellite systems ( e.g. mignard 1979 ) . in this paper , we assume that only the central and close - in bodies are mutually affected by the raised tides , whereas the outer companion is not directly affected by the tidal force . the orbital planes of planets are assumed to be coincident .",
    "we consider a short - period planet orbiting a slow - rotating central star ( @xmath57 ) , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the angular velocity of rotation of the star and the mean orbital motion of the planet , respectively .",
    "the long - term variations ( averaged over the inner planet orbital period ) of the planetary elements , due to the combined effects of tides raised on the star and on the inner planet , are written , up to @xmath60 , as : @xmath61\\ ] ] and @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 with @xmath64 being the strengths of stellar and planetary tides , respectively ( dobbs - dixon et al .",

    ", it is assumed a quasi - synchronous rotation state of the close - in planet ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "in addition , is is also assumed a linear dependence between phase lags and the corresponding frequencies appearing in the decomposition of the tidal potential of each body ( mignard 1979 ; ferraz - mello et al .",
    "for sake of simplicity , we consider that @xmath66 are constant ; however , it should be kept in mind that their dependence on frequencies can be important in the long - term evolution .",
    "the reader is referred to efroimsky and williams ( 2009 ) for more discussions on the frequency dependence of @xmath66 .",

    "figure [ alpha - fig ] shows the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath49 .",
    "we observe that , for all values of @xmath71 , @xmath0 varies in the range between 0 and 1 .",
    "the immediate consequence is that the tidal decay of a close - in planet is generally accompanied by the loss of orbital angular momentum of the system .",
    "the portion @xmath33 is absorbed by the system , damping the eccentricity of the inner planet .",
    "the amount @xmath0 is transferred to the central star and accelerates the stellar rotation ( see discussion of the next paragraph ) .    the stellar rotation changes due to tides on the star and , from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that its variation plays a role of external source of the angular momentum .",
    "the rate of variation of the rotational angular momentum is given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the stellar moment of inertia ( assuming that the inner planet has reached stationary rotation , we can neglect the spin variation of the planet ; e.g. rodrguez et al .",
    "2011 for more details ) . hence , using the definition of @xmath0 given in equation ( [ alpha0 ] ) , we obtain , for @xmath75 , @xmath76 since @xmath77 and @xmath78 during orbital decay of the inner planet , above equation results in @xmath79 , as previously discussed .    on one hand , equation ( [ alpha - tide ] )",
    "shows that , for @xmath29 , @xmath58 is a constant and there is no tides on the star ( i.e. @xmath80 ) . in this case , the orbital angular momentum of the system is conserved .",
    "inversely , knowing that @xmath81 , @xmath80 means that @xmath82 and , according to equation ( [ f2 ] ) , @xmath83 .",
    "hence , to second order in @xmath49 and according to equation ( [ alpha ] ) , we have @xmath29 .",
    "note that , for @xmath84 ( very large @xmath71 ) , the migration is halted when the orbit circularizes , that is , @xmath85 becomes constant because there is no orbital angular momentum transfer and @xmath86 .    on the other hand , when planetary tides are neglected , we have @xmath87 and , up to second order in @xmath49 , @xmath88 .",
    "this last expression shows that , after circularization of the inner planet orbit ( @xmath86 ) , the orbital angular momentum change due to the orbital decay is totally transferred to the stellar spin ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "evidence for excess of rotational angular momentum of the parent stars due to the tidal interaction with close - in giant planets have been already addressed in previous studies ( e.g. , pont 2009 ) .",
    "it is important to note that , during tidal interactions , @xmath0 is not constant but varies as a function of @xmath49 , according to equation ( [ alfaf2 ] ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath0 is always positive , meaning that the decreasing of the orbital angular momentum due to the orbital decay of the inner planet is compensated by both the damping of @xmath49 and the increase of @xmath58 .    .",
    "the angular momentum exchange is determined by the @xmath0function ( [ alpha ] ) defined through ( [ alfaf2 ] ) .",

    "they were obtained as discussed in section [ sec-1 - 2 ] , where the orbital angular momentum variation for each curve was defined by the function @xmath0 , according to equation ( [ alfaf2 ] ) .",
    "an application to the corot-7 planetary system , characterized by very small current eccentricities ( ferraz - mello et al .",
    "2011 ) was considered , whose results are plotted in the planes ( @xmath45 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the adopted migration scenario is schematically shown on the top of the figure . the divergent migration , together with the condition @xmath89 , results in the mode i ( @xmath90 ) of secular motion as an attractive center ( michtchenko and rodrguez 2011 ) .",
    "the current position of the system is marked with a star symbol and the arrows indicate the direction of the evolution ( orbital decay of the inner planet ) .",
    "we can note that migration tracks are sensible to the values of the parameter @xmath71 , and consequently , to the orbital angular momentum exchange . for small @xmath71 ( @xmath91 ) , corresponding to the nearly - total loss of the angular momentum variation produced by the orbital decay of the inner planet , both eccentricities vary only slightly during evolution . in this case ,",
    "when the strength of the stellar tide is dominating , the orbital configuration of the system in the past would be not different from the present one .",
    "the situation is very different in the case of large values of @xmath71 , when the strength planetary tide is dominating .",
    "large @xmath71-values imply that the orbital angular momentum of the system is almost conserved ( @xmath84 ) . in this case",
    ", the orbital configuration of the system in the past should be characterized by high eccentricities , as higher as larger are @xmath71-values . therefore , in the cases with dominating planetary tides , the origin of such high eccentric planetary orbits must be investigated .",
    "note that , during migration , the two - planet system could cross several mean - motion resonances , resulting in the temporary excitation of eccentricities but without trapping , since the orbits are divergent .",
    "several numerical simulations performed in rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and michtchenko and rodrguez ( 2011 ) , show that the system ultimately returns to the stationary secular solution after leaving the mean - motion resonance .",
    "we consider now the case of a pair of satellites orbiting a rapidly rotating parent planet ( @xmath92 ) .",

    "note that the only difference with respect to the previous case is in the tides raised on the planet ( or central body ) .",
    "we still note that the mean variations can be positive or negative , depending on the value of @xmath71 .",
    "hence , the combined effect of planet and satellite tides can induce either inward or outward migration , as well as either damping or excitation of eccentricity .",

    "[ sec-2 - 1 ] ) , @xmath0 is always smaller than 1 , which means that the orbital decay of the outer planet is always accompanied by damping of the eccentricity of its orbit ( see equation ( [ e1extdot2 ] ) ) .",
    "we also see that , for @xmath126 , @xmath34 for any value of @xmath114 ( we have discussed that @xmath131 ) , indicating that , after circularization of the planet orbit , the change of @xmath14 due to the orbital decay is totally transferred to @xmath19 , in this case , to the gaseous disc .",
    "in contrast with the case of star - planet tidal interactions , the function @xmath0 is not saturated at 0 ( see figure [ alpha - fig ] ) , but decreases monotonously with eccentricities towards negative values . according to equation ( [ alpha0 ] ) , negative values of @xmath0 imply in the loss of angular momentum by the disc during the orbital decay of the outer planet ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "thus , during migration , the pair of planets can either gain or lose orbital angular momentum , depending on the eccentricity of the migrating planet .",
    "a transition between leakage or gain of angular momentum occurs at @xmath29 , when @xmath50 reaches a critical value @xmath133 which is determined from equation ( [ alfaf4 ] ) , for a given @xmath114 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath134 , @xmath135 . for @xmath136 , the orbital angular momentum of the planet system",
    "is conserved ( since @xmath29 ) , however , this condition is only transitory . for @xmath137 , we have @xmath138 , indicating that a portion @xmath0 of the orbital angular momentum change due to migration is removed from the system and transferred to the disc ( @xmath139 , see equation ( [ alpha0 ] ) ) , while the portion @xmath33 is absorbed by the system altering the value of @xmath50 . when @xmath140 , we have @xmath141 and the system gains angular momentum from the disc . note that , in the latter case , the planet system gains angular momentum , despite the semi - major axis of the outer planet is decreasing .",
    "the evolutionary routes of the planet pair , obtained for several values of the parameter @xmath114 and for the angular momentum exchange defined by ( [ alfaf4 ] ) , are shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "the hypothetical system is composed of a sun - like central body and two planets of equal mass .",
    "the migration scenario shown on the top of the figure corresponds to the outer planet moving towards the inner planet . in this case , migration is convergent and the mode ii plays a role of an attractive center , since @xmath89 ( see michtchenko and rodrguez 2011 ) .",
    "planet eccentricities are damped during migration ( see equation ( [ gausse - medias ] ) ) , while the system approaches to one of the main mean - motion resonances , whose locations are indicated in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "because of small eccentricities , the probability of capture in a mean - motion resonance would be high , mainly for larger @xmath114-values .",
    "it is worth noting that , to achieve the current position of the system ( marked by a star symbol ) , a past orbital configuration with higher eccentricities is needed for all considered values of @xmath114 .",
    "it is important to stress that , during the migration path , the system crosses several mean - motion resonances , as shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "one should keep in mind that , when the rate of dissipation is small , the system may be trapped one of such resonances .",
    "since we restrict our investigations to the secular evolution of the systems , we fix the initial configurations of planet pairs far away from mean - motion resonances and , according to our model , neglect the possibility of a resonant capture .    ) , parameterized by constant values of @xmath114 . in this case , the angular momentum exchange is determined by the @xmath0function ( [ alfaf4 ] ) . ]      several works have simulated the disc - planet interaction adopting a simplified model of planetary migration ( e.g. lee and peale 2002 ; beaug et al .",
    "2006 , among others ) .",
    "the method avoids the use of hydrodynamic numerical simulations involving an accurate description of the interaction process between the gas and the planet body .",

    "the time evolution of orbital elements due to the action of the drag force given by ( [ stokes ] ) is , to first order in eccentricity :    @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the inverse of the e - folding times of @xmath147 and @xmath50 , respectively . introducing above equations into equation ( [ k1 ] )",
    "we obtain that @xmath148 .",

    "it is worth noting that , for @xmath134 , which is the usually adopted value ( beaug and ferraz - mello 1993 ) , we obtain @xmath150 , which matches the value determined empirically by lee and peale ( 2002 ) for the gj 876 resonant system ( the planets b and c evolve inside the 2/1 mean - motion resonance ) .",
    "the relationship ( [ k1 ] ) is frequently applied in moderate and even high eccentricity domains , specially when the evolution of resonant pairs of planets is modeled . however , comparing equations ( [ f ] ) and ( [ k1 ] ) we note that @xmath151 , that is , the assumption of constant @xmath142 is not appropriate in the case of eccentric orbits and the function @xmath152 , given by equation ( [ alpha3 ] ) , should be used instead @xmath153 ( see also kley et al .",

    "this case is related to high reynolds numbers and correspond to regions of turbulence in the gas medium .    using the euler - gauss equations with the external force ( [ stokes - gral ] ) and applying the averaged procedure ( over orbital periods ) ,",

    "in this work we model analytically the orbital angular momentum exchange of two - planet coplanar systems evolving under dissipative forces . two migration mechanisms were considered : tidal interactions in star - planet and planet - satellite systems and gaseous disc - planet interactions .",
    "our approach is based on the model developed in michtchenko and rodrguez ( 2011 ) , which shows that the angular momentum exchange between the orbital and the exterior components of the total angular momentum can be calculated through the @xmath0-function , referred to as the orbital angular momentum leakage . for each dissipative mechanism considered ,",
    "@xmath0 was calculated as a function of the planet eccentricity of the migrating planet and physical parameters involved in the process .    using the obtained @xmath0-function ,",
    "stationary solutions of the secular conservative problem were calculated for each specific migration scenario and for several values of physical parameters .",
    "stationary solutions provide evolutionary routes that the system would follow in the process of planetary migration and allows us to understand the dynamical history of the system evolving under dissipative forces .    the tidal interactions between a close - in planet with its host star results in the orbital decay of the inner planet .",

    ", the planet system always loses some part of the orbital angular momentum , which is used to accelerate the rotation of the star .",
    "large ( small ) values of the parameter @xmath71 ( ratio between the strengths of planetary and stellar tides ) are associated to weak ( strong ) stellar tides , enabling a substantial conservation ( dissipation ) of the orbital angular momentum of the system .    in the planet - satellite tidal interaction ,",
    "the situation is generally opposite . in this case",
    ", the migration of the inner satellite is predominantly outward . for typical values of the parameter @xmath71 ( in the range between 1 and 5 ) and moderate eccentricities ( @xmath107 ) ,",
    "the @xmath0-function is always larger than 1 .",

    "disk - planet interactions modeled through a drag stokes - like force , have shown that @xmath184 always .",
    "angular momentum can be removed ( @xmath185 ) or injected ( @xmath141 ) into the planet system .",
    "we have shown that the factor @xmath142 ( the ratio between eccentricity damping and orbital decay ) , which is frequently adopted as a free parameter of the dissipative problem , is a function of the outer planet eccentricity .",
    "in addition , @xmath142 also depends on the parameter @xmath114 , related to the disc properties .",
    "moreover , the assumption of constant @xmath142 is only valid in the domain of very small orbital eccentricities .",
    "finally , the development of the @xmath0-function for each dissipative process , and the consequent calculation of evolutionary routes allow us to reassemble the starting configurations and migration history of the planet systems on the basis of their current orbital configurations .",
