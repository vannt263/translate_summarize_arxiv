    "the second term expresses the fact that the position of each mass is the velocity times the time , so the time for a particular element of matter to be displaced is different due to the difference in propagation time along the direction of propagation .",
    "because the motion is perpendicular to the direction of propagation , elements of matter will remain at constant spacing ( to first order ) along the direction of propagation .",
    "thus the difference in the positions will be maximum at @xmath169 to the direction of propagation .",
    "so , at any given time and distance along the path of propagation , elements of matter will be closer together along one @xmath169 direction , and farther apart in the orthogonal @xmath169 direction .",
    "thus , within any plane at @xmath169 to the direction of propagation , matter will be alternatively `` stretched '' along one axis and  squeezed  along the orthogonal axis .",
    "this `` quadrupole '' pattern is similar to that predicted by gr , but rotated from the axis of propagation by @xmath169 .",
    "unless the absolute position and polarization phase of the gravitational source is known , the two theories can not be distinguished by their instantaneous effect on `` freely floating '' matter .",
    "because observatories like ligo have two arms perpendicular to each other , whose displacements are subtracted , the antenna patterns shown in section  [ antpat ] are exactly the same as the `` stretch - squeeze '' of matter along the corresponding orthogonal axes .",
    "hence these antenna patterns have four lobes , as appropriate for a quadrupole gravitational wave .",
    "as we have shown , a propagating transverse vector potential produces `` stretch - squeeze '' motion in free - floating matter much as a tensor wave would , but in planes at @xmath169 to the direction of propagation .",
    "the foregoing development is completely parallel to the corresponding derivation for electromagnetic waves given in [ * ce * ] .",
    "it has been known for many years that electromagnetic waves , which are vector in nature , propagate perfectly well from quadrupole sources@xcite .",
    "binary pulsar systems are , in principle , capable of exquisitely precise tests of any theory of gravitation .",
    "such tests rely on equally precise models of the binary system using the theory being tested .",
    "such models are presently being evolved using gr , and we hope that future versions will include g4v as well .      it should be noted that there is a tendency to identify quadrupole interaction with tensor propagation . that identity is only appropriate for theories with quantized radiation fields . in g4v and ce , the electromagnetic and gravitational fields are four - vector in character , and neither is quantized .",
    "in fact , there is not a single shred of evidence for quantization of either the electromagnetic or the gravitational radiation field .",
    "the casimir effect is often pointed to as `` proving '' the existence of virtual pairs , and therefore of field quantization .",
    "it was shown by jaffe@xcite that the `` casimir forces can be computed without reference to zero point energies .",
    "they are relativistic , quantum forces between charges and currents . ''",
    "virtual pairs thus have the role of simplifying certain calculations rather than providing evidence for field quantization .",
    "it is easy to see that virtual pairs , and therefore field quantization of the _ pro forma _ kind that is routinely taught in contemporary physics classes , can not be physically real . if they were , they would contribute a factor of @xmath198 more to the energy density of the universe than can be estimated from any method of observation .",
    "see@xcite for a thoughtful review of this well - known * cosmological constant problem*. thus the fictitious energy of vacuum fluctuations is seen as a deep _ conceptual problem _ in prevailing theory rather than a numerical or `` fine tuning '' problem , as it is often portrayed .    in ce and g4v ,",
    "the degrees of freedom of matter are not separate from the degrees of freedom of the field .",
    "quantization occurs in the region where field waves interact with matter waves ; not in the field in the absence of matter . in this view of the relationship of matter and field , there are no vacuum fluctuations , and the whole cosmological constant problem does not arise .",
    "as the earth rotates , the antenna patterns of sweep over the sky and modulate the amplitude of the received signals , including sign changes .",
    "coherent searches for pulsar signals heterodyne the received ligo signal against a sine and cosine reference locked to the pulsar radio signal ( see garching@xcite and ligo@xcite papers for details ) .",
    "the assumed amplitude response patterns are then used as `` matched filter '' templates on the heterodyned signal to bring it up out of the noise .",
    "often these searches integrate the signal , multiplied by the template , for a year or more .    to interpret a signal from a particular source at a particular observatory , we need the sensitivity as a function of the position of the source and the phase of earth rotation .",
    "the detector has a latitude @xmath199 ( from equator ) , east longitude @xmath190 , and @xmath200 is the angle between the @xmath25 arm of the interferometer and the local northerly direction .",
    "for example technical note ligo - t980044 - 08 gives the directions of the x and y arms for the ligo hanford and livingston observatories .",
    "the orientation for hanford corresponds to a right - hand rotation from @xmath201 by @xmath202 , and that for livingston to a right - hand rotation from @xmath201 by @xmath203 .",
    "the source coordinates are its declination @xmath160 ( from equator ) , its right ascension @xmath204 , its polarization angle @xmath111 and its inclination , shown as @xmath28 in .",
    "the time dependence has been combined in the local * sky angle * @xmath205 of the source from the observatory .",
    "the sky angle advances from to east to west with time .",
    "a source with larger right ascension @xmath204 appears farther to the east , and thus has a smaller sky angle when viewed from a given point on earth .",
    "the same source appears farther to the west and therefore has a larger sky angle when viewed from a point of larger east longitude @xmath190 .",
    "therefore @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the earth rotation rate and @xmath208 is the local sidereal time .",
    "a rotating source such as the binary shown in has two additional angles :    1 .",
    "the * inclination angle * @xmath28 is the angle from the line of sight to the rotation axis of the source .",
    "a source with @xmath72 has its rotation axis perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "a source with @xmath209 has its rotation axis pointed at the earth .",
    "2 .   the * polarization angle *",
    "@xmath111 is the left - hand rotation angle about the line of sight from earth to the source by which the source rotation axis appears to be rotated from the plane of celestial north .      to transform the detector coordinates into the source coordinate system ,",
    "we first rotate around the z ( vertical ) axis by an angle @xmath210 so the @xmath41 axis is pointing due east , and the @xmath25 axis due north .",
    "we then rotate around the x ( east ) axis by the observatory latitude @xmath199 to align the north - pointing @xmath25 axis with the earth s polar axis .",
    "next we rotate around the @xmath25 ( now polar ) axis by an angle @xmath211 ( negative because a right - hand rotation goes from west to east ) to take out the earth s rotation and place the @xmath32 axis in the meridian of the star .",
    "then we rotate around the @xmath41 ( east ) axis by an angle @xmath212 to point the @xmath32 axis at the star .",
    "then we rotate around the @xmath32 axis by an angle @xmath213 to align the @xmath25 axis with polarization angle of the star .",
    "finally we rotate about the @xmath25 axis by @xmath214 to transform into the source frame , where the @xmath32 axis is identified as the propagation vector @xmath13 , pointing at the earth , and the @xmath25 axis is in the plane of the source rotation axis , as shown in . after these rotations , the result is a vector containing the projection of the arm unit vector onto @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath13 directions in the source frame of reference .",

    "note that these @xmath51 rotation matrices rotate the coordinate system ( alias rotation ) , not the vector in a fixed coordinate system ( alibi rotation ) , and are thus the transpose of the usual alibi rotation matrices .",
    "because the interferometer takes the difference between the fringe shifts of the two arms , the sensitivity of the detector to the two polarizations is , from @xmath219 these sensitivities are the response of the detector to a vector potential of unit amplitude in the @xmath41 and @xmath28 directions of . the actual fringe shift due to a signal from a distant source",
    "is obtained by using the actual vector potentials @xmath62 and @xmath63 , given by .",
    "these two vector components of the total potential @xmath0 are called the * polarizations * of the wave .",
    "the output @xmath195 of the ligo detector is the sum of the two polarizations , each multiplied by its respective sensitivity : @xmath220 in general the actual data will be a series of discrete samples @xmath221 recorded at times @xmath222 .",
    "since the source inclination @xmath28 is not a function of time over the periods involved in the search , we write for @xmath221 as a function of @xmath222 @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "+ if @xmath226 , would represent a * circularly polarized * wave .",
    "because , as shown in , @xmath227 always , the g4v signal is * elliptically polarized*.",
    "any spinning mass distribution that is not uniformly distributed around its rotation axis will radiate gravitational waves of the kind described , and will therefore be potentially detectable by a ligo - type detector .",
    "the most promising candidates are those that are the closest to us , have the most `` lopsidedness '' , and about which we have some knowledge of the rotation rate @xmath19 .",
    "a class of objects that meet these criteria are the pulsars that have resulted from recent cataclysmic astronomical events .",
    "the reception of electromagnetic pulses from these objects makes it possible to construct a time base that is presumably related to the spin frequency , and therefore to the gravitational - wave frequency @xmath19 .",
    "the approach to detecting gravitational waves from these objects was pioneered by the garching group@xcite and has been refined and extended by members of the ligo and virgo collaboration .",
    "see in particular matt pitkin s thesis@xcite and references therein .",
    "the technique starts with a heterodyne ( multiplication ) of the original data with both a sine and a cosine function , with frequency @xmath228 chosen to lie at twice the pulsar rotation rate .",
    "these two heterodyned series are then lowpass filtered ( for reasons of antialiasing ) before resampling .",
    "we will refer to the real functions resulting from the heterodyning of the original data @xmath221 as the cosine and sine quadratures : @xmath229 the low - pass filter step removes the sum - frequency terms , leaving @xmath230 the radio astronomy community has developed exquisitely precise methods for synchronizing time coordinates . applying those techniques to the pulsar problem has made possible the creation of precise sine and cosine waveforms that are locked to the electromagnetic `` beeps '' received from the pulsar .",
    "we thus have at our disposal during the heterodyne step of a time coordinate such that @xmath231 , where the phase @xmath232 between the electromagnetic `` beeps '' and the gravitational wave is not known .",
    "the @xmath233th sample output of the heterodyne process contains a cosine part @xmath234 and a sine part @xmath235 @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath238 , given by , are periodic functions of the time @xmath222 with period 1 sidereal day .",
    "the most straightforward technique for recovering a signal from random noise is the * matched filter * , in which we multiply each signal sample by a * template * representing the sensitivity for a unit - amplitude version of the expected signal at the time @xmath222 of that sample , sum the results over all data samples available , and divide by the number of samples .",
    "the result is an estimate of the amplitude of the expected signal actually present in the data .",

    "a match was computed for both right - hand ( rh ) and left - hand ( lh ) rotation : @xmath246 because the phase @xmath232 is not known , the calculation of is carried out for a number of values for @xmath232 , typically 36 .",
    "experimentally , a plot of @xmath247 as a function of @xmath232 is an extremely smooth sine wave , even for data that is pure noise .",
    "for that reason we take the maximum of such a plot minus the minimum as our estimate @xmath248 of the amplitude @xmath69 : @xmath249      the process began with heterodyned data prepared with exquisite care by matt pitkin .",
    "the largest outliers were trimmed as described in section [ plc ] . at this point",
    "the standard deviation of the complex data for h1 was @xmath250 . before attempting a search for any actual signal",
    ", it was important to establish the background statistical properties of the data as it is reflected in accidental correlations between the noise and the templates .",
    "for this purpose we require a version of the received signal in which there is no crab signal . +",
    "this catch-22 situation is solved in the following way : the complex data are re - heterodyned by multiplying each complex data sample by @xmath251 where @xmath208 is the sample time and @xmath252 is a frequency well within the passband of the heterodyned data .",
    "this operation does not change the amplitude , but approximately orthogonalizes the signal with respect to the template .",
    "a data set of this type was prepared using frequencies from .008 hz below the crab frequency to .008 hz above , spaced by @xmath253 hz , giving a total of @xmath254 frequencies .",
    "each frequency was re - heterodyned to base band and matched to both right - hand and left - hand rotation g4v templates .",
    "the results are shown in .",
    ", height=377 ]      a set of 100 g4v crab signals was prepared with amplitudes randomly distributed from zero to 3% of the standard divination of the data , and phases randomly distributed from 0 to @xmath255 .",
    "a subset of the original @xmath256 data sets were augmented with 100 additional sets , to each of which was added a different one of the synthesized signals .",
    "the results are shown in the left plot in . by keeping track of the amplitude of each insertion",
    ", we can compare it with the amplitude actually recovered by the search of the data set containing that insertion , as shown in the right plot in .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]      there are many phenomena that have a daily period modulated on a yearly basis , the power line load being only one of them",
    ". however the narrow ( 1/60 hz ) bandwidth of the crab heterodyned data near 60 hz makes power - related noise particularly suspect .",
    "if this supposition is taken as a working hypothesis , it might be possible to find correlation between some of the ligo environmental monitors and the outliers identified in the present study .",
    "on the other hand , it is entirely possible that the crab heterodyne is itself the most sensitive indicator of disturbances in its narrow band of frequencies .",
    "there are an uncountable number of ways the power line can couple into any experiment .",
    "the ligo interferometer , being the most sensitive instrument ever devised by the human race , is vastly more prone to contamination than any other .",
    "the consequence of this situation is that no environmental monitor is likely to be anywhere near as sensitive to this contamination as the interferometer itself .",
    "the integrity of the power grid near hanford is particularly high .",
    "the facility is near the center of one of the most extensive hydroelectric power developments in the world@xcite .",
    "not only do the nearby power plants have a large excess generating capacity , but , more important in the present context , they provide a massive  spinning reserve \" the term for synchronous , electrically coupled angular momentum that lends stability to the phase of the power grid voltage in the face of load transients .",
    "perhaps nowhere else in the world is the power grid environment so favorable for a near-60 hz search .",
    "these circumstances lead us to interpret the remarkable superiority of the hanford crab data as being , most probably , the result of its superior power - line integrity .    no gravitational - wave signal was detected from the crab pulsar at a level above 1% of the standard deviation of the norm of the heterodyned data@xcite .",
    "thus the outliers must be from sources other than the crab , and any correlation with the crab gravitational - wave signal must be purely accidental .",
    "this being the case , the transient outliers in the raw heterodyned data can be discarded as described here with negligible impact on the statistical significance of the result due to `` snooping the data''@xcite . calculating the exact revision to the p - values determined in the search due to this data cut",
    "is left to the experts .",
    "we conclude that discarding at least 10% of the data points , corresponding to the largest outliers in the heterodyned crab data , is a logical and reasonable step in the crab pulsar search process , and that any effect on the integrity of the result due to this step is likely to be be negligible .",
    "we present this theorem for electromagnetic radiation . + in g4v ,",
    "the relations for weak gravitational radiation are identical with two changes :      the green s function integral forms for the retarded scalar and vector potentials are : @xmath259 where @xmath146 is the distance from the source point to the point at which @xmath79 and @xmath0 are measured .",
    "we consider a compact charge distribution that is changing with time , and inquire about the general properties of the far - field radiation from that charge distribution . by far - field",
    "we mean that the distance @xmath146 from any point in the source to the point of observation is larger than any dimension of the source by a large enough factor that , for any two points in the source , @xmath260 is constant to within the accuracy required .",
    "we choose our coordinate system so that the vector from the source to the point of observation is in the @xmath41 direction .",

    "because the green s functions ( ) are linear , if the longitudinal electric field is zero for each pair of slices individually , it will be zero for the sum as well .",
    "the far - field radiation from any source approaches a plane wave arbitrarily closely at large distances from its source .",
