    "recognizing people we know from unusual poses is easy for us , as illustrated on figure  [ fig : teaser ] . in the absence of a clear , high - resolution frontal face , we rely on a variety of subtle cues from other body parts , such as hair style , clothes , glasses , pose and other context .",
    "we can easily picture charlie chaplin s mustache , hat and cane or oprah winfrey s curly volume hair .",
    "yet , examples like these are beyond the capabilities of even the most advanced face recognizers .",
    "while a lot of progress has been made recently in recognition from a frontal face , non - frontal views are a lot more common in photo albums than people might suspect .",
    "for example , in our dataset which exhibits personal photo album bias , we see that only 52% of the people have high resolution frontal faces suitable for recognition .",
    "thus the problem of recognizing people from any viewpoint and without the presence of a frontal face or canonical pedestrian pose is important , and yet it has received much less attention than it deserves .",
    "we believe this is due to two reasons : first , there is no high quality large - scale dataset for unconstrained recognition , and second , it is not clear how to go beyond a frontal face and leverage these subtle cues . in this paper",
    "we address both of these problems .",
    "+        0.55     0.44              we introduce the _ people in photo albums ( pipa ) _ dataset , a large - scale recognition dataset collected from flickr photos with creative commons licenses .",
    "it consists of 37,107 photos containing 63,188 instances of 2,356 identities and examples are shown in figure [ fig : dataset_examples ] .",
    "we tried carefully to preserve the bias of people in real photo albums by instructing annotators to mark every instance of the same identity regardless of pose and resolution .",
    "our dataset is challenging due to occlusion with other people , viewpoint , pose and variations in clothes .",
    "while clothes are a good cue , they are not always reliable , especially when the same person appears in multiple albums , or for albums where many people wear similar clothes ( sports , military events ) , as shown in figure [ fig : challenges ] . as an indication of the difficulty of our dataset , the deepface system  @xcite , which is one of the state - of - the - art recognizers on lfw  @xcite , was able to register only 52% of the instances in our test set and ,",
    "because of that , its overall accuracy on our test set is 46.66% . we plan to make the dataset publicly available .",
    "we propose a pose invariant person recognition ( piper ) method , which uses part - level person recognizers to account for pose variations .",
    "we use poselets  @xcite as our part models and train identity classifiers for each poselet .",
    "poselets are classifiers that detect common pose patterns .",
    "a frontal face detector is a special case of a poselet .",
    "other examples are a hand next to a hip or head - and - shoulders in a back - facing view , or legs of a person walking sideways . a small and complementary subset of such salient patterns is automatically selected as described in  @xcite .",
    "examples of poselets are shown in figure [ fig : poselets ] . while each poselet is not as powerful as a custom designed face recognizer , it leverages weak signals from specific pose pattern that is hard to capture otherwise . by combining their predictions",
    "we accumulate the subtle discriminative information coming from each part into a robust pose - independent person recognition system .",
    "we are inspired by the work of zhang et al .",
    "@xcite , which uses deep convolutional networks trained on poselet detected patches for attribute classification .",
    "however our problem is significantly harder than attribute classification since we have many more classes with significantly fewer training examples per class .",
    "we found that combining parts by concatenating their feature in the manner of  @xcite is not effective for our task .",
    "it results in feature vectors that are very large and overfit easily when the number of classes is large and training examples are few .",
    "instead , we found training each part to do identity recognition and combining their predictions achieves better performance . unlike @xcite",
    ", we propose a new way to handle the sparsity from poselet detections which boosts the performance by a large margin .",
    "we demonstrate the effectiveness of piper by using three different experimental settings on our dataset .",
    "our method can achieve 83.05% accuracy over 581 identities on the test set .",
    "moreover when a frontal face is available , it improves the accuracy over deepface from 89.3% to 93.4% , which is @xmath040% decrease in relative error .",

    "most of the existing face recognition systems require constrained setting of frontal faces and explicit 3d face alignments or facial keypoint localizations .",
    "some other works @xcite have addressed robust face recognition systems to deal with varying illumination , occlusion and disguise . due to our unconstrained setting ,",

    "our system performs very well even with a single training example per identity , achieving 28.1% accuracy for our test set of 581 identities .",
    "this result illustrates the powerful generalization capability of our method .",
    "the generalization capabilities of deep features are well studied , but we believe here we are also helped by the mixture of multiple part - based classifiers , since our system improves faster than the global method of fine - tuned krizhevsky s cnn .      we evaluate our method on the task of retrieval : given an instance , we measure the likelihood that one of the k nearest neighbors will have the same identity .    to do this we used the svms trained on split 0 of the validation set to predict the 366 identities in the validation set .",
    "we applied them to the instances in the test set to obtain a 366-dimensional feature vector for each part and we combine the part predictions using equation  [ eq : joint ] with @xmath2 trained on the validation set to obtain a single 366-dimensional feature for each instance in the test set .",
    "we then , for each instance of the test set , compute the k nearest neighbors using eucledian distance and we consider retrieval as successful if at least one of them is of the same identity .",
    "this has the effect of using the identities in the validation set as exemplars and projecting new instances based on their similarities to those identities .",
    "as figure  [ fig : unsupervised ] shows our method is quite effective on this task  despite the low dimensional feature and without any metric learning , the nearest neighbor of 64% of the examples is of the same identity as the query . if we use the predictions of the krizhevsky s cnn trained on imagenet and fine - tuned on our training set , which is known to be a very powerful baseline , the nearest neighbor is of the same class in only 50% of the examples .",
    "this suggests that our model is capable of building a powerful and compact identity vector independent of pose and viewpoint .",

    "piper can learn effectively even with a single training example and performs surprisingly well at the task of image retrieval .",
    "while we have used piper for person recognition , the algorithm readily applies to generic instance co - identification , such as finding instances of the same car or the same dog .",
