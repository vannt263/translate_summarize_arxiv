    "recently , beneke , buchalla , neubert and sachrajda @xcite have presented a promising factorization formula for the charmless nonleptonic b decays .",
    "the basic object in the calculation of b charmless nonleptonic decays is the hadronic matrix element @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the effective operator inducing the decay , @xmath10 is the final meson absorbing the light spectator quark from b meson , and @xmath11 is another light meson flying fast from the b quark decay point as implied by @xmath12 .",
    "the light spectator quark is translated softly to @xmath10 and this effect would be taken to the nonperturbative form factor @xmath13 unless it undergoes a hard interaction . the quark pair , forming @xmath11 , ejected from b decay point carrying large energy of order of @xmath14 will involve hard interaction , since soft gluon with momentum of order @xmath15 will decouple from the quark pair at leading order in @xmath16 in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the essence of the argument of @xcite can be summarized by the improved factorization formula @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the p meson s light - cone distribution amplitudes(da ) .",
    "the hard amplitudes @xmath19 can be perturbatively expanded in @xmath20 and can be obtained from the calculations of the diagrams in fig.1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath21 would be unity and @xmath22 would be absent at zeroth order of @xmath23 in the formula of eq.([fac ] ) , then the @xmath24 @xmath25 would be reproduced .",
    "another consequence of eq.([fac ] ) is that the final state interactions may be computable and appear to be the imaginary part of the hard scattering amplitudes .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the formalism to @xmath26 decays and recalculate @xmath27 decays with electroweak penguin contributions .",
    "we also present detailed discussions about the strong penguin contributions and therefore we obtain the corrections to the chiral enhanced terms , which are found free of infrared divergence .",
    "we point out that there is large cancellation between the strong penguin hard scattering amplitudes and its contributions are small .",
