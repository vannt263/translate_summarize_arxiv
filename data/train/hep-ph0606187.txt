    "calculation of the form factors for semileptonic transitions of @xmath9 mesons has been being a subject discussed intensely .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the @xmath10 transition form factor can be consistently analyzed by using the different approaches in the different @xmath11 regions @xcite . the perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",
    "can be applied to the @xmath10 form factor in the large recoil ( small @xmath11 ) region and it is reliable when the involved energy scale is large enough @xcite .",
    "the qcd light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) can involve both the hard and soft contributions to the @xmath10 form factor below @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd simulations of the @xmath10 transition form factor @xcite are available only for the soft region @xmath13 , because of the restriction to the @xmath14 energy smaller than the inverse lattice spacing .",
    "thus the results from these three approaches might be complementary to each other . in ref.@xcite",
    "we recalculate the @xmath10 form factor in the pqcd approach , with the transverse momentum dependence included for both the hard scattering part and the nonperturbative wave functions(of @xmath14 and @xmath9 ) to get a more reliable pqcd result . by combining the results from these three methods we obtain a full understanding of the @xmath10 transition form factor in its physical region @xmath15 .",
    "up to now , in comparison with heavy - to - light cases the calculations on heavy - to - heavy transitions can be done only for a certain specific kinematical range , although there have been a lot of discussions in the literature . in the bsw model @xcite ,",
    "the relevant form factors at zero momentum transfer are expressed as an overlap of initial and final meson wave functions for which they take the solutions of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation in a relativistic harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "then one extrapolates the result at @xmath16 to the whole kinematical region assuming the nearest pole dominance . with the discovering of the heavy quark symmetry , the @xmath17 form factor",
    "have been known better at zero recoil .",
    "this is because of the fact that in the heavy quark limit the resulting form factors    isgur - wise functions @xcite at zero recoil are rigorously normalized . including the leading symmetry breaking corrections , the deviation from this limit",
    "can be estimated at an order of a few percent due to luke s theorem and therefore the value of the form factor at this point can be determined within a higher accuracy @xcite",
    ". however , the dependence of the form factor on the velocity transfer @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the velocities of the @xmath9 and @xmath1 mesons respectively ) is difficult to get even in the leading order , in view of the arbitrary function @xmath21 @xcite which is introduced to simulate higher - resonances in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the lattice qcd , despite a rigorous nonperturbative approach , is just adequate to estimate the behavior of the form factors near the zero recoil @xcite . among the other approaches are the qcd sum rules and pqcd .",
    "ref.@xcite applies the traditional @xmath22-point sum rule to calculate the form factor at zero momentum transfer .",
    "it is concluded in ref.@xcite that pqcd approach is applicable in the large recoil region and can give a consistent result with the experiment .",
    "it is necessary that there is a reliable estimate of @xmath23 transition in the whole kinematically accessible range @xmath24 , in order to account for the data on @xmath0 . for this purpose , it is practical , as shown in @xmath25 case , to combine the result of qcd lcsr with those from the lattice qcd , heavy quark symmetry and pqcd .",
    "the lcsr approach @xcite , where the non - perturbative dynamics are effectively parameterized in so - called light - cone wave functions , is regarded as an effective tool to deal with heavy - to - light exclusive processes .",
    "although the @xmath17 transition in question is a heavy - to - heavy one , the @xmath26-quark is much lighter compared to @xmath27-quark and so discussing it with lcsr is plausible for the kinematical range where the ope near light - cone @xmath3 is valid .",
    "the other problem with our practical calculation is that the higher twist da s of d meson , which are important but less studied , would enter into the sum rule result .",
    "however , an effective approach @xcite has been presented to avoid the pollution by some higher - twist da s .",
    "this improved lscr method uses a certain chiral current correlator as the starting point so that the relevant twist-@xmath22 wave functions make no contributions and the reliability of calculation can be enhanced to a large extend .",
    "its applicability has been examined by a great deal of studies @xcite . in this paper",
    "we would like to employ the improved lcsr to discuss the form factor for the @xmath17 transition and try to give a full understanding of qcd dynamics involved in the @xmath28 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section we derive the lcsr for the form factor for @xmath23 .",
    "a discussion of the da models for the @xmath1-meson is given in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the numerical analysis and comparison with other approaches .",
    "the last section is reserved for summary .",
    "the @xmath17 weak form factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 are usually defined as : @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the momentum transfer . on the other hand ,",
    "when applying the heavy quark symmetry to do discussion the following definition is advisable , @xmath33.\\ ] ] if we neglect the masses of leptons in the decay final state of @xmath34 , only @xmath29 is relevant and thus we can confine us to the discussion on @xmath29 .",
    "obviously , the following relation is observed between @xmath29 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 .    using the heavy quark symmetry ,",
    "the value of form factor @xmath39 at zero recoil could be fixed better . since in heavy quark limit @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the form factor @xmath39 should be close to @xmath42 .",
    "a systematic investigation gives @xmath43@xcite , with a less model dependence .",
    "this result is also confirmed with lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "pqcd analyses are also made in the large recoil region @xmath44 , yielding a result consistent with the data .",
    "the lcsr calculation can help to understand @xmath45 in the whole kinematical region in complementary to the lattice qcd with the heavy quark symmetry and pqcd approaches .    to achieve a lcsr estimate of @xmath46 ,",
    "we follow @xcite and use the following chiral current correlator @xmath47 : @xmath48    in the first place , we discuss the hadronic representation for the correlator .",
    "this can be done by inserting the complete intermediate states with the same quantum numbers as the current operator @xmath49 . isolating the pole contribution due to the lowest pseudoscalar @xmath9 meson",
    ", we have the hadronic representation in the following : @xmath50 note that the intermediate states @xmath51 contain not only the pseudoscalar resonance of masses greater than @xmath52 , but also the scalar resonances with @xmath53 , corresponding to the operator @xmath54 . with eq.([eq : def ] ) and the definition of the decay constant @xmath55 of the @xmath9-meson @xmath56 and expressing the contributions of higher resonances and continuum states in a form of dispersion integration , the invariant amplitudes @xmath57 and @xmath58 read , @xmath59=\\frac{2f(q^2)m_b^2f_b}{m_b(m_b^2-(p+q)^2)}+ \\int^\\infty_{s_0}{\\frac{\\rho^h(s)}{s-(p+q)^2}ds}+\\mbox{subtractions},\\ ] ] and @xmath60=\\frac{\\tilde{f}(q^2)m_b^2f_b}{m_b(m_b^2-(p+q)^2)}+ \\int^\\infty_{s_0}{\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}^h(s)}{s-(p+q)^2}ds}+\\mbox{subtractions},\\ ] ] where the threshold parameter @xmath61 should be set near the squared mass of the lowest scalar @xmath9 meson , the spectral densities @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be approximated by invoking the quark - hadron duality ansatz @xmath64    on the other hand , we need to calculate the corrector in qcd theory to obtain the desired sum rule result .",
    "in fact , there is an effective kinematical region which makes ope applicable : @xmath65 for the @xmath66 channel and @xmath67 for the momentum transfer .    for the present purpose , it is sufficient to consider the invariant amplitude @xmath68 which contains the desired form factor .",
    "the leading contribution is derived easily by contracting the @xmath69quark operators to a free propagator : @xmath70substituting eq.([eq : pro ] ) into eq.([eq : cc ] ) , we have the two - particle contribution to the correlator , @xmath71 an important observation , as in ref.@xcite , is that only the leading non - local matrix element @xmath72 contributions to the correlator , while the nonlocal matrix elements @xmath73 and @xmath74 whose leading terms are of twist @xmath22 , disappear from the sum rule . proceeding to eq.([eq : qq ] )",
    ", we can expand the nonlocal matrix element @xmath75 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the twist-2 da of d meson with @xmath78 being the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the @xmath26-quark , those da s entering the higher - twist terms are of at least twist @xmath79 .",
    "the use of eq.([eq : da ] ) yields @xmath80=2f_dm_b\\int_0 ^ 1{du\\frac{\\varphi_d(u)}{m_b^2-(up+q)^2}}+\\mbox{higher twist terms}. \\label{eq : qq1}\\ ] ]    invoking a correction term due to the interaction of the b quark with a background field gluon into ( 10 ) , the three - particle contribution @xmath81 is achievable .",
    "however , the practical calculation shows that the corresponding matrix element whose leading term is of twist @xmath22 also vanishes .",
    "thus , if we work to the twist-3 accuracy , only the leading twist da @xmath82 is needed to yield a lcsr prediction .",
    "furthermore , we carry out the subtraction procedure of the continuum spectrum , make the borel transformations with respect to @xmath83 in the hadronic and the qcd expressions , and then equate them . finally , from eq.([eq : f12 ] ) follows the lcsr for @xmath84 , which is applicable to the velocity transfer region @xmath85 , @xmath86 } \\varphi_d(u)},\\label{eq : ff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 has been used .",
    "now let s do a brief discussion on an important nonperturbative parameter appearing in the lcsr formula([eq : ff ] ) , the leading twist da of @xmath1-meson , @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath1-meson is composed of the heavy quark @xmath26 and the light anti - quark @xmath90",
    ". the longitudinal momentum distribution should be asymmetry and the peak of the distribution should be approximately at @xmath91 . according to the definition in eq.([eq : da ] ) , @xmath89 satisfies the normalization condition @xmath92 which is derived by the leptonic decay @xmath93 .    in the pqcd calculations @xcite ,",
    "a simple model ( we call model i ) is adopted as @xmath94 which is based on the expansion of the gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "eq.([eq : da1 ] ) has a free parameter @xmath95 which ranges from @xmath96 to @xmath42",
    ". we will take @xmath97 as input .",
    "on the other hand , it was suggested in @xcite that the light - cone wave function of the @xmath1-meson be taken as : @xmath98}\\label{eq : wf}\\ ] ] which is derived from the brosky - huang - lepage(bhl ) prescription @xcite .",
    "@xmath99 can be related to the da by the definition @xmath100 substituting eq.([eq : wf ] ) into eq.([eq : wf - da ] ) , we have a model of the da(model ii ) @xmath101},\\label{eq : da2}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 can be fixed by the normalization([eq : constraint1 ] ) and the probability of finding the @xmath104 fock state in the @xmath1- meson , @xmath105 @xmath106 as discussed in ref.@xcite , @xmath107 is a good approximation for the @xmath1-meson ( as we have checked , change of @xmath105 makes a numerical effect less than @xmath108 ) .",
    "then , taking @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , as argued in ref.@xcite , a more complete form of the light - cone wave function should include the melosh rotation effect in spin space : @xmath115}\\ ] ] with the melosh factor , @xmath116 it can be seen from eq.([eq : melosh ] ) that @xmath117 as @xmath118 , since there is no spin interaction between the two quarks in the heavy - flavor meson , ie .",
    ", the spin of the heavy constituent decouples from the gluon field , in the heavy quark limit @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath26-quark is not heavy enough to neglect the melosh factor .",
    "after integration over @xmath119 the full form of @xmath1 meson da can be achieved ( model iii ) : @xmath120 \\exp{\\left[-b_d^2\\frac{(xm_d^2+(1-x)m_c^2-y^2)}{x(1-x)}\\right]}\\label{eq : da3},\\ ] ] where @xmath121 and the error function @xmath122 is defined as @xmath123 . using the same constraints as in eq.([eq : constraint1 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) , the parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 are fixed as @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    in this paper we will employ the above three kinds of models to do numerical calculation .",
    "all these da s of the @xmath1-meson are plotted in fig.([fig : wf ] ) for a comparison .",
    "it is shown that they are of similar shape and all of them exhibit a maximum at @xmath126 as expected .",
    "apart from the da of @xmath1-meson , the decay constant of @xmath9-meson @xmath55 is among the important nonperturbative inputs . for consistency , we use the following corrector @xmath127 to recalculate it in the two - point sum rules .",
    "the calculation should be limited to leading order in qcd , since the qcd radiative corrections to the sum rule for @xmath46 are not taken into account .",
    "the value of the threshold parameter @xmath128 is determined by a best fit requirement in the region @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the corresponding borel parameter .",
    "the same procedure is performed for @xmath46 , resulting in different values of the threshold parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the result is listed in tab.[tab : s0 ] .",
    "choosing @xmath61 and @xmath128 in this way , the dependence of @xmath55 and @xmath46 on the borel parameter is very weak and thus we can simply evaluate them at @xmath131 .",
    "the other input parameters are taken as @xmath132 .",
    "as we have ignored all the radiation corrections , we do nt expect our values of @xmath55 to be good predictions of that quantity .",
    ".parameter sets for @xmath55 and @xmath46 , @xmath128 and @xmath61 for @xmath55 and @xmath46 respectively ; @xmath133 and @xmath55 are given in gev , @xmath61 and @xmath128 in @xmath134 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the parameters chosen , it is straightforward to calculate the form factor @xmath46 in the region @xmath135 .",
    "the results with different sets of parameters are plotted in fig.([fig : f(mb ) ] ) , where only model ii has been used for simplicity .",
    "it is shown that the change of parameters can induce a uncertainty of about @xmath136 if we let @xmath133 vary between @xmath137 . by fitting the data",
    ", the behavior of @xmath45 has been known using the parametrization @xmath138,\\ ] ] with @xmath139 corresponding to the linear and quadratic fits @xcite , respectively . with the three da models ,",
    "the resulting dependence of @xmath46 on the velocity transfer @xmath140 , along with that extracted experimentally is illustrated in fig.([fig : f(y ) ] ) . in what follows",
    ", we denote the lcsr results for the form factor by @xmath141 and those extracted experimentally by @xmath142 . for comparison , a figure - copy which expresses the pqcd results in @xcite",
    "is given in fig.([fig : pqcd ] ) .",
    "in the region to which the lcsr method is applicable , the central values of @xmath141 turn out to be a bit smaller than the corresponding those of @xmath143 , using the da models ii and iii as inputs ; however , both of them are in accordance with each other within the error . the situation with model i da is about the same .",
    "the central value of the form factor at the largest recoil is @xmath144 versus @xmath145 , depending on the da models .",
    "we note that the behavior of @xmath141 is essentially unchanged when the three different da s are used . from the present calculations , therefore it is too early to draw a conclusion which da model is more suitable to reflect the characteristics of qcd dynamics inside the @xmath1 meson .",
    "when a comparison is made between the pqcd and lcsr predictions , the consistent results can also be observed at the larger recoil .",
    "of course , the two approaches describe the different dynamics in @xmath146 transitions . whereas the use of lcsr approach is to assume that the soft exchanges dominate in the weak decay in question , applying pqcd method to do calculation corresponds to the viewpoint that the hard exchanges do .    in fact , the kinematical region we give , which makes lcsr results valid , is a conservative estimate .",
    "it is possible to extrapolate the present lcsr calculation to the small recoil region .",
    "if it is true , we find that in the whole kinematically accessible range @xmath147 , the yielding lcsr estimates are compatible with the data .",
    "for instance , at zero recoil it follows that @xmath148 ( using model iii ) , which is in a good agreement with the evaluation obtained using the heavy quark symmetry : @xmath43 .",
    "nevertheless , we have to emphasize that a full understanding of the dynamics involved in @xmath149 transition should be obtained by combining the three different approaches    the lattice qcd calculations with the heavy quark symmetry considered , lcsr results and pqcd predictions , which are complementary to each other .",
    "the lcsr results with chiral current correlator may act as a bridge connecting those of other approaches .",
    "@xmath150    @xmath151    @xmath152    @xmath153",
    "we have discussed the form factor for @xmath17 transitions @xmath46 , using the improved qcd lcsr approach where with the chiral current correlator chosen only the leading twist da of the @xmath1-meson is relevant at twist-3 accuracy .",
    "the resulting lcsr s for @xmath46 are available in the velocity transfer region @xmath2 .",
    "calculation is done using three different twist-2 da models for d meson .",
    "it is shown the numerical results are less sensitive to the choice of da , and are of a central value slight smaller than but within the error in a agreement with those obtained by fitting the data on @xmath4 . in the larger recoil region @xmath5 where pqcd is applicable , the results presented here are consistent with ones of pqcd . from the practical calculations , we find that the present results might be extrapolated to the smaller recoil region so that the @xmath17 transitions are calculable in the whole kinematically accessible range , using the improved lcsr approach .    also , we argue that for understanding the form factor for @xmath154 in the whole kinematical range a combined use is necessary of three different methods : the lattice qcd ( with the heavy quark symmetry considered ) , improved lcsr and pqcd approaches , which are adequate to do calculation in different kinematical regions and so could be complementary to each other .",
    "the lcsr approach plays a bridge role in doing such calculation .",
    "the present findings can be improved once the qcd radiative correction to the lcsr is taken into account and a more reliable",
    "twist-2 da of @xmath1 meson becomes available . from the previous discussion in @xcite , however , it is expected that the qcd radiative correction can not change the present results too much .",
