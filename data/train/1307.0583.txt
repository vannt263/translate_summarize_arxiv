    "the multilayer coating model  @xcite was proposed as a novel method to push up the rf - breakdown field of superconducting cavities .",
    "the model consists of alternating layers of superconductor layers ( @xmath0 ) and insulator layers ( @xmath1 ) formed on a bulk nb .",
    "the @xmath0 layers are assumed to withstand higher field than the bulk nb and shield the bulk nb from the applied rf surface field @xmath2 , by which @xmath2 is decreased down to @xmath3 on the surface of the bulk nb .",
    "then the cavity with the multilayered structure is thought to withstand a higher field than the nb cavity , if @xmath2 is smaller than the vortex penetration field  @xcite of the top @xmath0 layer @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is smaller than @xmath6 , which is thought to be the maximum field for the bulk nb .    in order to evaluate the maximum surface field of a cavity with the multilayered structure , correct formulae that can describe the shielded magnetic field @xmath5 and the vortex penetration field of the top @xmath0 layer @xmath4",
    "should be derived  @xcite .",
    "the detailed derivation process of the magnetic field attenuation formulae and thus the shielded magnetic field @xmath5 of the multilayer coating model with a single superconductor layer and a single insulator layer formed on a bulk superconductor is found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the maxwell equations and the london equations are solved with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the vortex penetration field is derived from competing forces acting on a vortex at a top of the @xmath7 layer .",
    "the vortex feel two distinct forces : ( i ) a force from an image current @xmath8 due to an image antivortex , and ( ii ) from a meissner current @xmath9 due to an external field . in this paper these two forces",
    "are evaluated , and the vortex penetration field of the multilayer coating model is derived .",
    "in this section the vortex penetration field of the superconductor film in an uniform magnetic field is evaluated as a simple example . the procedures shown here",
    "can be applied to the multilayer coating model in the next section .",
    "let us consider a superconductor film immersed in an uniform magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the film is parallel to the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane and thus parpendicular to the @xmath12-axis .",
    "the region @xmath13 is the superconductor with the london penetration depth @xmath14 and the coherence length @xmath15 , and the other regions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are vacuum .",
    "the applied magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath11-axis , and is given by @xmath18 .",
    "it is assumed that the material of the film is an extreme type ii superconductor ( @xmath19 ) , and the film thickness is larger than the the coherence length ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "suppose that a vortex that is parallel to the @xmath11-axis is at @xmath21 , an edge of the film .",
    "then an antivortex at @xmath22 is introduced as an image of the vortex to satisfy the boundary condition of zero current normal to the surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the magnetic field of the antivortex is given by @xmath23 for @xmath24  @xcite , where @xmath25 is the flux quantum and @xmath26 is a distance from its core at @xmath22 .",
    "the associated current density at the vortex position @xmath21 is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "then the vortex receives the lorentz force  @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an unit vector .",
    "thus the vortex is attracted by the antivortex outside the film .",
    "it should be noted that an infinite number of images are required to satisfy the boundary condition . under the assumption @xmath31 ,",
    "however , the vortex at @xmath21 receives a force from the nearest image at @xmath22 dominantly , and contributions from other images are negligible .    in order to evaluate the force due to the external field",
    ", the distribution of screened field in the film is required . since the magnetic field in the film",
    "can be derived from the london equation @xmath32 with boundary conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we obtain @xmath35",
    ". then the meissner current at the vortex position is given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where the assumption @xmath31 is used .",
    "thus the force from the external field is given by @xmath38 by which the vortex is attracted to the inside of the film .",
    "the force acting on the vortex is given by summation of the above two forces : @xmath39 .",
    "when the external field @xmath2 is so small that @xmath40 , the force @xmath41 directs the outside of the film .",
    "this force acts as a barrier that prevents the vortex penetration , which is called the bean - livingston barrier . when the external field @xmath2 is so large that @xmath42 , the barrier disappears and the the vortex is drawn into the film . the external field that lets these two forces balance",
    "is called the vortex penetration field @xmath4 , which can be evaluated by solving the equation @xmath43 when the film has an infinite thickness ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath4 is reduced to the well - known expression for the semi - infinite superconductor , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the thermodynamic critical magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "when the film thickness is thinner than the london penetration depth ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath4 is reduced to that for the thin film superconductor  @xcite , @xmath48 it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bvthin ] ) can not be applied to the multilayer coating model , because the magnetic fields on the both sides of one superconductor layer have different amplitudes . in the next section , the vortex penetration field of the multilayer coating model",
