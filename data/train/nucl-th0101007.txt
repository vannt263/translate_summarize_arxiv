    "pion - nucleon interaction plays a fundamental role in determining the nuclear dynamics involving pions . despite very extensive investigations in the past two decades ,",
    "several outstanding problems remain to be solved .",
    "for example , an accurate description of pion absorption by nuclei @xcite is still not available and hence the very extensive data for pion - nucleus reactions and pion productions from relativistic heavy - ion collisions have not been understood satisfactorily . to make progress , it is necessary to improve our theoretical description of the @xmath5 off - shell amplitude which is the basic input to most of the existing nuclear calculations at intermediate energies .",
    "the importance of the @xmath5 off - shell t - matrix in a dynamical description of pion photoproduction has also been demonstrated @xcite in recent years .",

    "models based on meson - exchange picture @xcite have been very successful in describing the @xmath11 scattering .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that the @xmath5 dynamics at low and intermediate energies can also be described by the same approach .",
    "most of the recent attempts @xcite in this direction were obtained by applying various three - dimensional reductions of the bethe - salpeter equation for @xmath5 scattering .    as is well known @xcite , the derivation of a three dimensional formulation from the bethe - salpeter equation is not unique .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the resulting off - shell dynamics in the relevant kinematic regions depends strongly on the choice of the reduction scheme .",
