    "@xcite    however , circumstantial evidence is abundant .",
    "the existence of min oscillations clearly demonstrates that chemical reactions actually present in a bacterium have the ability to manufacture chemical waves and trap them .",
    "nature presumably created this machinery for some purpose .",
    "min oscillations are known to involve only a small number of substances .",
    "the exact number is controversial , but the reactions are typically modeled with four or five , the same as in eqs .",

    "existing experiments are not sufficiently detailed to distinguish among these models , but elementary reaction - diffusion is central to all of them , and all become similar to eqs .",

    "the fundamental simplicity of the reactions was indicated early on by identification of mincde operon damage as the cause of the minicell mutation in _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite , but it is now corroborated by experiments _ in vitro _ showing both oscillations and spatial waves occurring in system containing only mind , mine , a lipid membrane , and atp @xcite .",
    "the frequencies and lengths observed in these experiments do not agree with those observed in real bacteria , but this is not surprising given how finely tuned a reaction - diffusion system must be to measure lengths accurately .",
    "they are like a watch with a corrupted regulator : it still ticks , but it does not keep time .",
    "it is not important that the min amplifier machinery resides in or near the cell membrane @xcite . for length measurement purposes ,",
    "this machinery is adiabatically equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) , meaning that it can be slowly deformed into scalar waves trapped in the bacterial body without changing its functionality .",
    "the corresponding wave speed @xmath29 is about 0.15 @xmath57m / sec , the same as slow calcium waves .",
    "the wave principle also has potential bearing on the overall shape of bacteria , most of which are cylinders of fixed width . the reasons for preferring this shape are not presently known .",
    "@xcite to measure the width of the body with a wave , one must excite the first azimuthal eigenmode of eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) , also shown in fig .",
    "this corresponds to a motion around the perimeter perpendicular to the body axis .",
    "this mode is necessarily doubly degenerate so long as the body is exactly cylindrical , so the corresponding form would not automatically be a cylinder unless the symmetry is broken , meaning that either right - handed or left - handed motion is preferred .",
    "this is a different issue from the handed spiral structures reported in bacterial walls @xcite because it requires also breaking of time - reversal symmetry , as occurs in a magnet .",
    "such symmetry breaking is known to occur in _",
    "e. coli _ , where it manifests itself through preferred swimming handedness on glass slides , an effect attributable to a preferred rotation direction of the flagellum .",
    "@xcite    the shape - regulating protein mreb has recently been observed to execute motion circumferential and perpendicular to the body axis in _ b. subtilis _",
    "the experiments employ difficult sub - wavelength optical microscopy , and some details remain controversial .",
    "the reported azimuthal velocities range from 7 nm / sec to 50 nm / sec , and one group reports a handedness bias while another rules it out .",
    "however , there is general agreement that mreb aggregates into small patches and that these translocate along the cell wall in a direction accurately perpendicular to the body axis .    in the context of mensuration",
    "it is not important whether the patch motion involves cell wall synthesis , as the experiments seem to suggest it does .",
    "the principles by which diffusion is converted to wave motion are so general that they apply equally well to polymerization .",
    "anything one says about eucaryotic size and shape control is necessarily speculative because so little definitive is known about it .",
    "however , the physical principles of resonant trapping are so simple and general that one might reasonably guess that they apply also to eucaryotic cells .     for two different values of @xmath58 .",
    "this shows how a standing wave grating can be made to split centrosome locations by increasing the amplitude of its first harmonic .",
    "middle : the same quantity for the two - dimensional case expressed as a contour plot .",

    "( [ helmholtz ] ) for a spherical cavity , as might be appropriate for a eucaryotic cell .",
    "everything is the same as for the pill - shaped cavity except for the boundary conditions , which we force to be mixed , thus pushing the antinode from the cell surface into the interior .",
    "mixed boundary conditions are appropriate for amplification machinery that resides partly in bulk interior and partly on or near the membrane .",
    "[ f3 ] also shows trajectories generated by the rule of everywhere going downhill in the wavefunction gradient .",
    "the similarity to the mitotic spindle is unmistakable . thus were an oscillating chemical potential field providing the navigation instructions for microtuble assembly , it would account quantitatively for ( 1 ) the location of centrosomes ( the antinodes ) , ( 2 ) the existence and location of the metaphase plate , ( 3 ) the choice of a particular orientation for this plate , ( 4 ) the initiation and termination microtubules at the centrosomes , ( 5 ) their intersection at right angles with the metaphase plate , ( 6 ) their outward bulging at the plate , ( 7 ) the oblique angle formed between backward - going microtubules and the cell membrane , and ( 8) the observed scaling of the spindle assembly with cell size @xcite",
    ".    waves also have the potential to account for the organization of structures without cell membranes .",
    "[ f5 ] shows a simple model of a syncytium made with standing waves .",
    "this specific construction uses three waves oriented at a physical angle @xmath60 with respect to each other and also oscillating @xmath61 out of phase with each other in time so as to create a `` twinkling eyes '' dynamical pattern .",
    "@xcite the recipe for locating the spindles is the same as in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . the equations used to generate fig .",
    "[ f5 ] are much too primitive to describe an actual syncytium , among other reasons because the nuclei in real syncytia are not ( can not be ) hexagonally arranged and because they have cytoskeletal structures where the cell membranes would normally have been .",
    "nonetheless fig .",
    "[ f5 ] shows how standing waves can create organizational patterns beyond the immediate neighborhood of a specific nucleus , and thus how they might organize larger multi - cellular eucaryotic structures .",
    "there are some additional potential benefits , such as providing a natural signal to synchronize mitotic division and automatically scaling structures in a syncytial embryo to egg size .",
    "dynamic reaction - diffusion is not a novel length mensuration method so much as an engineering advance over an older , more primitive one .",
    "when implemented at the molecular level , it uses exactly the same chemistry that static reaction - diffusion does but simply manages time differently",
    ". an apt analogy would be the time management that distinguishes the internet from the telegraph .",
    "both use electricity to work , but the latter uses it more cleverly and is thus vastly more powerful .",
    "dynamic mensuration is thus fully compatible with experimental evidence that small organisms use the static version often if the latter is imagined to be vestigial .",
    "@xcite    the crucial engineering advantage of dynamic mensuration over the static variety is plasticity . to measure out a length with an elementary diffusive morphogen",
    "one must balance a uniform destruction rate against a diffusion constant , a strategy that works perfectly well so long as the design is fixed .",
    "but if one wishes to change the design , one must modify the diffusion constant , the destruction rate , or both , making sure that the latter remains uniform .",
    "if , on the other hand , one tunes the chemical reactions to manufacture waves with a fixed speed , lengths can be easily adjusted up or down simply by changing frequencies of stimulating oscillators .",
    "these need not be located in any particular place , for standing waves are rigid and thus insensitive to the location of their stimulus , an effect familiar from the operation of musical instruments .",
    "thus the difficult hardware design need only be done once .",
    "the hardware can then be used again and again to measure out lengths of any size one likes , even with the latter changing on the fly in response to external events not encrypted in the genes .",
    "the other important advantage of dynamic mensuration is generalizability .",
    "once the concept of turning diffusion into waves using amplifiers is discovered , it is very easy to imagine going by small steps to the invention of a sophisticated organ like the cochlea , which uses the same engineering principles but exploits mechanical diffusion , not chemical diffusion .",
    "it is similarly easy to imagine going by small steps to the invention of neurons , which involve the same circuitry but with the amplifier gain turned up to make the propagating pulse nonlinear , and in which the underlying diffusive motion is electrical , not chemical .",
    "diffusion is a very general physical phenomenon that results when when motion becomes disorganized .",
    "the trick of reversing the descent into diffusive chaos using engines thus has applicability far beyond basic chemistry .",
    "it is not a great concern that direct biochemical evidence for dynamic length measurement is thin .",
    "bacteria , in particular , are very ancient , and it perfectly reasonable that they should employ both old and new technologies to form their bodies .",
    "but the more insightful observation is that laboratory detection of chemical potential oscillations is difficult and requires significant signal strength and integration time to do .",
    "oscillations in other organisms might simply have not been found yet or be too weak or rapid to see easily .",
    "the diffusion constants of mind and mine have been measured _ in vivo _ by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to be roughly @xmath62/sec @xcite .",
    "an amplifier time of @xmath63 sec , a number characteristic an ion channel protein , gives a maximum propagation velocity of @xmath64 @xmath57m / sec , the speed of a fast calcium wave . for a bacterium @xmath65 m long",
    ", this gives a round - trip transit time of 0.06 sec .",

    "<S> i point out that the difficulty of accounting for length relationships of parts of organisms with equations disappears instantly if the organism is premised to have discovered a way to emulate elementary physical law . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one simple invention is sufficient to facilitate the measurement and construction of body plans of any shape and size one might wish in a way that is both plastic and scalable : the conversion of diffusive motion into _ linear _ waves using engines . </S>",
    "<S> the concept is general because all motion in the presence of disorder , including motion of cytoskeletal components , becomes diffusive at long time and length scales by virtue of evolving into a random walk . </S>",
    "<S> but if engines can transform this random walking into propagation with stable direction and speed , then signals can be beamed , like a flashlight , reflected from boundaries , and trapped . </S>",
    "<S> once this happens , the organism can measure lengths the same way human engineers do , by echo timing or by fringe counting and resonance . </S>",
    "<S> body designs based on this strategy are inherently plastic because fixing the speed enables lengths to be laid out or detected by means of clock tick intervals , which are easy to change .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 and @xmath1 all have negative values . on the right </S>",
    "<S> is shown the impulse response described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ impulse ] ) for the special case of @xmath2 . the voltage step height @xmath3 is set to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the current response , plotted as a multiple of @xmath4 , is negative and has the same shape as a neuron action potential . ]    </S>",
    "<S> although it is not widely known , biological systems can easily manufacture such waves using elementary reaction - diffusion chemistry similar to that at work in neuron action potentials . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the key is tuning the chemical reactions to the edge of an instability , an effect known in the cochlear amplifier literature as criticality . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as i shall show , this trick is so easy to implement technically that it is hard to imagine how nature would not have exploited its tremendous engineering advantages in the struggle for survival . </S>",
    "<S> this obligates us to take seriously even very small hints that nature did , in fact , discover how to do it long ago . </S>",
    "<S> the simple explanation for why we have found only sparse empirical evidence for such waves so far is that chemical potential waves are difficult to detect with existing laboratory techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the larger idea implicit in this proposed resolution of the length problem is that biological systems can not conduct engineering without rules any more than we humans can , so they invented some in the ancient past , and the ones that worked best turned out to be same ones we humans discovered later using reason . </S>"
