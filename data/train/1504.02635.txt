    "the link between massive progenitor star and the type of core - collapse event it produces at the end of its nuclear burning live is the fundamental piece of information that underpins our understanding of the physical processes involved in stellar explosions . .",

    "many of these , as individual events , are quite compatible with stellar evolutionary model predictions .",
    "the fact that numerous red supergiants are now observed as the stellar end points that produce the most common class of type ii sn is a validation of modern stellar structure theory . in 2009 ,",
    "the number of detections of progenitor stars had reached a point that analysis of samples was possible @xcite and a review of what these constraints meant for the field in the broader sense was warranted .",
    "since then there has been further very significant progress and results which are more consequential than just an increase in sample size .",
    "this review will consider work done in the field since 2009 , and review the results as a whole in the context of the sn population we observe in the local universe as quantified by , for example , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "some of the highlights in the last 5 years are the significant increase in the sample size , nine further detections of progenitors , evidence for the disappearance of progenitor stars many years after explosion and detections of possible binary companions .",
    "there has also been active discussion in the literature concerning the analysis methods , particularly in the treatment of extinction toward progenitors and how that may affect the luminosity and mass estimates .",
    "there are even some progenitor stars with multi - epoch data that allow pre - explosion variability to be probed , and as data sets grow then lightcurve monitoring of progenitors may become more common place ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in an attempt to set a well defined sample , @xcite ( and later * ? ? ?",
    "* ) defined criteria for selecting a time and volume limited sample of sne for which searches for progenitors were feasible : all ccsne in galaxies with recessional velocities @xmath4(corrected for virgo infall , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath5mpc for @xmath6mpc@xmath7 ) .",
    "this distance limit was imposed from practical experience of analysing hst archival image data and the difficulty in retrieving photometry of resolved individual massive stars beyond this distance .",
    "additionally , as galaxy number count increases as the distance cubed , the relative number of galaxies with high quality archival imaging rapidly decreases .",
    "hence the probability of finding coincidences of sn discoveries combined with existing pre - explosion images of the galaxies also falls off quickly . as we will see later in this review",

    "there have been some remarkable discoveries of individual stars before explosion , with tight physical constraints on their luminosity and temperature @xcite some of which have been shown to have disappeared @xcite .",
    "however the most interesting aspect of this area is now the statistical sample of more than a dozen unambiguous direct detections and many restrictive limits to produce a defined survey sample of 44 objects .",
    "objects outside this distance limit have also contributed to our understanding , such as the massive progenitor of sn2005gl at 60mpc @xcite but the relative frequency of such an event needs to be put in context with the fixed volume sample .",
    "this review extends the time and volume limited sample introduced by @xcite and @xcite for the type ii and ibc progenitors to the end of 2013 .",
    "the discussions is extended to include all other progenitors within this survey sample including the iib and iin types and some beyond .",
    "the closest sne provide the best opportunity for studying their progenitors , carrying out multi - wavelength monitoring until very late times .",
    "it is likely that we are not missing a large fraction of sne in galaxies closer than @xmath812mpc as the starformation rates of these galaxies are in quite good agreement with the measured sn rate for a a lower mass limit of 8  for core - collapse ( although * ? ? ?",

    "they suggest that any particular mass may be uncertain to within 4 - 5  but the overall mass range derived for type ii - p progenitors is quite similar to that originally derived in @xcite .",
    "all of this work has put the estimates of stellar parameters on a firmer footing with some changes in the stellar @xmath10 and @xmath11 for various progenitor stars .",

    "there are problems with all of these estimates , but even more important is that this line of sight extinction may either not be directly applicable to the progenitor ( as in the case of the surrounding stellar population ) or may be simply a lower limit since it does not take into account circumstellar medium extinction in the locality of the progenitor star ( see the discussion in section[sec:12aw ] ) .",
    "it is quite possible , and indeed probable that csm dust ( within a radius of approximately 10 - 100@xmath18 , where @xmath18 is a typical red supergiant ( rsg ) radius of a 500 - 1000 ) is destroyed during the uv flash of the sn .",
    "the discovery of a dust enshrouded progenitor , and a relatively unobscured transient for sn2008s @xcite illustrated this possibility , followed by the case of sn2012aw ( section[sec:12aw ] ) .",

    "the results of the theoretical modelling of stellar mass - loss rates and dust production of @xcite will be discussed further in section[sec : explain ] .          as discussed in the previous two sections , the pre - discovery images of type ii - p sne are often not deep enough to detect the progenitor stars .",
    "this is not surprising since for distance moduli of @xmath21 ( 10 - 25mpc ) and the typical depth of hst images ( @xmath22 ) , the lowest luminosity red supergiants would go undetected . if the broad picture of core - collapse , neutron star formation and successful sne occurring in stars above an initial mass of @xmath88is true , then the initial mass function _ must _ dictate that the bulk of ccsne we detect are from the lower mass region .",
    "the iib sne are those which begin by resembling type ii sne with unmistakable hi balmer lines and evolve to have h - weak and he - strong spectra , the prototype of which is sn1993j @xcite .",
    "it s remarkable that the three iib sne in the 1999 - 2013 distance and time limited survey which have high quality imaging _ all _ have relatively bright progenitors ( or progenitor systems ) detected at the sn position .",
    "the detections of the progenitors of sn2008ax @xcite ; sn2011dh @xcite ; and sn2013df @xcite are summarised in table[tab : iib ] .",

    "it too had a luminosity of @xmath26   @xcite .",
    "the colours of the progenitor of sn2008ax could not be satisfactorily fit with a single stellar sed @xcite or with a plausible binary which led the authors to suggest it might be a single wr - type star or a system which has contaminated flux from a physically associated cluster or nearby stars .",
    "crockett et al .",
    "found the absolute magnitude of the star coincident with the sn position to be @xmath27 , and if we assume a bolometric correction of @xmath28 ( to cover possible supergiant stars from late b - type to early k - type ) then this implies a stellar @xmath29but with quite large uncertainties due to the difficulty in fitting a single sed .",
    "suggest that the progenitor could have been a rotating star of around 20  that ends its nuclear burning life as a  compact lbv \" with a luminosity of around @xmath30dex .",
    "nevertheless , taken together the iib progenitors tend to be brighter , more often detected , and of systematically higher luminosity than the bulk of the type ii - p sne .",
    "the model of iib sne coming from extended supergiants which have had mass stripped due to a binary companion was supported initially by the detection of a progenitor companion in sn1993j @xcite and recently also for sn2011dh at the time of discovery of sn2011dh , a yellow star dominated the sed of the progenitor system and the community had split views on whether the yellow supergiant or its putative compact companion had exploded ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the disappearance of the bright yellow star @xcite and the detection of a uv source remaining at the sn position by @xcite is strong evidence that it was indeed the yellow supergiant that exploded and that it had a more compact companion ( see the model in * ? ? ?",
    "it remains to be seen if the existing , and follow - up data for sn2013df and sn2008ax also can be explained with binary models .",
    "however it is certain that the progenitors all have luminosities around @xmath31 , albeit with the assumption that the bolometric correction for the sn2008ax progenitor is not unusually high .",
    "the stellar evolutionary models employed in the studies discussed in this section to explain the progenitor luminosities have zams masses in the range 13 - 17 .",
    "it would appear that iib progenitors are consistently among the highest luminosity ( and hence highest mass ) progenitors so far detected .",
    "there are few other upper limits , and with four cases of nearby iib sne all with bright , detected progenitors it seems reasonable to conclude that they are not produced by lower mass systems in the 8 - 12  range .",
    "the physical reason for this is not determined and it will be interesting in the future to test quantitative models . one may speculate that it could be due to higher mass stars forming closer binaries more easily or brighter progenitors being more extended and hence their envelopes more efficiently undergoing roche lobe overflow when they reach the l1 point .",
    "a spectrum of the light echo of cas a showed this milky way supernova to be of type iib @xcite .",
    "there is no sign of an obvious companion star in the centre of the cas a remnant , leading to the speculation that this was a high mass single star that lost most of its hydrogen envelope through winds",
    ". however the total amount of gas either ejected or residing in the csm , and therefore recently ejected by the progenitor is not particularly high .",
    "the mass of the shocked and unshocked ejecta is estimated at @xmath32@xcite and the mass in the csm which the blastwave has swept up is around 8@xcite .",
    "adding in @xmath33  for a neutron star remnant , results in a total progenitor mass estimate of about 15 . the internal structure seen in the ejecta",
    "originate from turbulent mixing processes and plumes of @xmath34ni - rich material @xcite .",
    "these detailed constraints are in reasonable agreement with the the results from the three iib sne with progenitors discussed above - originating from stars with initial masses in the range @xmath35 .",
    "however the puzzle remains for cas a - if the star had no companion , and the initial mass was only @xmath815 , then how did it lose its envelope to become a iib sn ?",
    "one might speculate it was a high mass , obscured star , although it seems the extinction toward cas a is no more than @xmath36 @xcite and this is integrated along the galactic line of sight rather than being local to the sn and the progenitor .",
    "there are two possible models for the progenitors of type ibc supernovae .",
    "the first are wolf - rayet stars which are evolved , single massive stars that have lost their hydrogen envelopes ( in the case of wn stars ) and also helium layers ( in the case of wc and wo stars ) primarily through radiatively driven winds , or episodic mass - loss @xcite or through rapid rotation and chemically homogenous evolution .",
    "the observed wolf - rayet stars in our galaxy and the magellanic clouds are observationally constrained to come from stars ( either single or binary ) above about 25 - 30  from considerations of the turn off masses in stellar clusters . from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "the stellar winds of single stars below this mass are not strong enough alone to cause sufficient mass loss to expose the he and co cores .",
    "these stars are predominantly found in young stellar clusters and ob associations within the local group and turn - off masses for coeval stellar populations have provided estimates of mass and age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the second alternative is lower mass stars in binary systems with initial masses lower than that required for single stars theoretical stellar populations including binaries with reasonable distributions of stellar masses and separations can produce large number fractions of he stars with core masses large enough to undergo core - collapse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this paper described the compilation of literature data , and new analysis of images of the progenitors of a total of 12 type ibc sne .",
    "there are no detections of progenitors , or progenitor systems in any of these .",
    "the deepest limits in the typical @xmath37-bands were between @xmath38 and @xmath39 and , the authors compared these limits with the observed magnitudes of wr stars in the large magellanic cloud . as wr stars , or stripped he stars in binary systems , have diverse temperatures and radii ( and hence diverse colours , seds and bolometric corrections ) the quantitative fitting methods which have been successful for type ii progenitors can not be applied to the ibc limits without major uncertainties in the results .",
    "hence a more empirical approach was applied which simply postulated that the observed wr star population of the lmc are plausible progenitor systems of ibc sne and then determined what was the statistical uncertainty that no detections were made . since then , there have been two further ibc sne within the distance limit , also with no detections of progenitors : sn2013dk @xcite and sn2012cw @xcite . @xcite",
    "originally estimated the probability of not finding a progenitor system detection , _ if the lmc wr population are direct progenitors of ibc sne _ to be 16% , and with the inclusion of the limits of sn2013dk and sn2012cw this drops to @xmath812% .",
    "this is an interesting constraint but not in itself strong enough to rule out wr stars being the progenitors of the normal ibc population we see in the local universe .",
    "several other authors have argued that the temperature and luminosity ( which of course dictate optical and nir fluxes ) of the observed wr population are not applicable to wr stars at the point of collapse and that significant evolution to higher temperatures and fainter optical magnitudes occur in their models .",
    "these of course are dependent on the mass loss rates and the time to core - collapse from where we observe them now .",
    "it is also possible that the extinction toward these progenitors , or csm extinction , is systematically underestimated as discussed above for the type ii - p progenitors and limits ( in section[sec : iisum ] ) .",
    "there are two other strong constraints on the progenitors of type ibc sne .",
    "the first is their relatively high rate which has been explained with binary population models ( for example as discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently @xcite pointed out that the the sn rates from the volume limited lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) imply a rate ( 26% of all cc ) that is a factor of @xmath82 too high for massive , single wr stars to be the sole producers just from simple imf arguments .",
    "an imf of single stars would produce a wr fraction ( and hence a ibc fraction ) of 14 - 18% of all massive stars between 8 - 100  if the minimum mass to produce a wr is 25 - 30 .",
    "@xcite built on this with the binary population and spectral synthesis ( bpass ) code to calculate rates of progenitors in stellar population models including binaries .",
    "the rate of ibc sne within 28mpc ( during 1998 - 2012.25 ) is also 26% , and @xcite find that the rates can only be produced if a mixed population of single stars and binaries are used with one single star for every binary system and the mass ratio and initial separations are set such that approximately two thirds of the binaries interact .",
    "this value is compatible with the observed result of @xcite who showed that this fraction of massive binaries are likely to interact .",
    "these multiple and consistent observational constraints from relative sn rates and the binary fraction of massive stars are rather compelling arguments that binary systems are likely to produce the bulk , if not all of the ibc sn progenitors .",
    "@xcite points out that the reason that galactic analogues may be difficult to identify is that stars in binaries with initial masses below 20tend to retain a low - mass hydrogen envelope until quite close to core - collapse , @xmath40yrs .",
    "hence they are not easily detectable as h - free compact helium stars .",
    "the second additional argument for ibc sne coming from interacting binaries is that the ejecta masses calculated from lightcurve modelling are typically in the range 1 - 4   ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "subsequent alignment in @xcite with hst imaging again found a similar result but supported the suggestion by @xcite that this was likely the progenitor system and the first detection of a stellar progenitor of a ibc sn . @xcite and proposed that the broad band magnitudes of the source in the hst images were similar to massive wr stars and a stellar model of initially @xmath46evolved into a wn star with model parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48kk ( producing a final co star mass of 10 ) . a reassessment of the hst magnitudes of the progenitor led @xcite to argue that a binary system could explain the updated stellar magnitudes better .",
    "they found brighter magnitudes by about 0.5@xmath49 ; @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "these updated magnitudes do not rule out the single wr models of , but the model binary systems reproduce the measurements quite well .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite presented binary models as alternatives which have initial masses of either @xmath53  or @xmath54  components .",
    "these produce a stripped he - core with a final mass of @xmath55  and the combined flux from the binary systems can reproduce the progenitor magnitudes .",
    "the ejecta mass would then be of order 2  in agreement with the estimate of from lightcurve modelling . while a single , massive wr star can not be definitively ruled out , the progenitor magnitudes and ejecta mass estimates are quite well reproduced with a binary system ( see section[sec : lumfunc ] for a position on the hertzsprung russell diagram ) .",
    "in a recent development in this area , @xcite took a spectrum of sn2013cu within the first day after explosion showing that it has spectral features similar to those seen in wr stars ( specifically hi , hei , heii , civ and niv seen in wn type stars ) .",
    "while this could be interpreted as evidence for a direct wr progenitor star , @xcite note that the inferred wind density and mass - loss rate are rather extreme when compared to typical wr stars .",
    "applied a more detailed analysis code to suggest that a wr progenitor star , with a classical radiatively driven wind , is not likely and the precursor was possibly an lbv - type or yellow hypergiant with a recent eruptive phase .",
    "sn2013cu was a type iib and the mass - loss event that produced the circumstellar mass illuminated in the wind could have plausibly occurred during mass - transfer in a binary or in an eruptive phase .",
    "the remarkable spectrum is similar to galactic wr star spectra , although the emitting surface is likely a factor @xmath810 larger than the typical wr stellar radii and the the narrow cores of the emission lines seen in sn2013cu are not typical of fast wr wind lines . as @xcite and",
    "point out , the spectrum of the early sn is not a direct indicator of the spectral type of the progenitor star before explosion , but it is a powerful measure of the recent mass - loss history of the progenitor .",
    "it shows that the csm material within @xmath56au is similar in h and he composition to wn star winds , rather than the star definitely being a wr - type progenitor .",
    "there are three sne which have been proposed as core - collapse sne of type iin with either identified high luminosity stellar progenitors detected or reasonably strong arguments in favour of high - mass progenitors .",
    "the first discovered was the progenitor of sn2005gl which was a bright @xmath57 progenitor detected at the surprisingly large distance of 60mpc @xcite    the type iin sn2010jl has hst pre - explosion imaging of its host galaxy ( at 50mpc ) and @xcite identified the site of the explosion . at this distance the relatively crowded region of the explosion site",
    "prevents a confident detection of a resolved point source , but the blue flux coincident with the sn is likely to be either a very young cluster or a single massive star .",
    "@xcite argued that either of these two cases suggest that the progenitor had an initial mass higher than @xmath58 .",
    "both of these sne occurred within the time limit of the survey defined by @xcite and @xcite but are much more distant than the 28mpc limit .    the now infamous sn2009ip is a type iin sn @xcite with a progenitor detected in outburst over many years . after the initial discovery of a non - terminal , but luminous ( @xmath59 ) outburst in 2009 @xcite at which point it",
    "was named sn2009ip , a luminous progenitor star ( @xmath60 ) was detected in hst archival imaging taken in 1999 @xcite .",
    "subsequent monitoring over the next three years , mostly by @xcite illustrated that the explosion in sn2009ip was part of a regular , but temporally sporadic , series of outbursts of a massive star which photometrically shared similarities with the luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) of the local group .",
    "indeed it is not even clear if the detection in the hst imaging is the star in outburst or quiescence and hence attaching a bolometric luminosity to any of the data points is not easy to interpret with hydrostatic stellar evolutionary models .",
    "it may be that the luminosity is powered at all phases , including that in the archival hst images , by interaction ( and the same could be true for sn2005gl ) .    in 2012 ,",
    "the star had a 30 day outburst that peaked at a luminosity similar to the brightest known lbv giant outbursts ( the2012a \" event ; @xmath61 , @xmath62ergs@xmath7 ) , which was followed by a 10 day rise to sn luminosities ( the2012b \" event ; @xmath63 , @xmath64ergs@xmath7 ) ( monitored by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the cause and nature of the two are still debated .",
    "@xcite fervently argue that core - collapse must have occurred to cause the bright 2012b peak , and indeed many observational characteristics of this explosion are similar or identical to type iin supernovae . @xcite and",
    "@xcite propose that the fainter `` 2012a '' event was a non - terminal giant eruption , that core - collapse caused gas to be accelerated to velocities of @xmath65  and the kinetic energy of this gas is efficiently converted to radiative energy in colliding with a dense , but possibly asymmetric csm to produce a bright sn .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite argued that it is still possible that the last sn - like event in the history of sn2009ip was not due to core - collapse , but caused by the collisions of massive shells ejected from the star with dense a csm .",
    "the energetics are plausible , although are disputed by @xcite .",
    "other papers on the topic @xcite have also presented extensive data and analysis but none as yet have definitively proven the true nature .",
    "@xcite have suggested that at least 50% of type iin sne have outbursts within the last few years of their explosion .",
    "this seems plausible given the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) discovery rate , the other discoveries of pre - explosion outbursts @xcite and the theoretical ideas of hydrodynamic instabilities discussed in @xcite .",
    "whatever mechanism powers the bulk of iin sne it appears clear that eruptions in the few years before explosion are much more frequent that previously thought .    for the purposes of this review , the interesting question concerns",
    "the possibility that very massive stars produce successful sne through the core - collapse mechanism .",
    "the faintest magnitude that the progenitor star of sn2009ip was observed at was @xmath66 , and with a bolometric correction appropriate for a blue supergiant ( @xmath67 ) , this equates to @xmath68 = 6.0 - 6.3dex , or an initial mass of 60 - 80 .",
    "the discussion that follows , will consider the possibility that sn2009ip has undergone a core - collapse and successful explosion .",
    "although it has been reasonable to link supernovae of types iin to lbvs or very massive stars that have had violent recent mass - loss history , an alternative explanation was recently put forward by @xcite . in this model , a red supergiant with a fairly standard mass - loss rate ( such as betelgeuse with @xmath69yr@xmath7 ) produces a static shell of circumstellar material through pressure from photoionization by radiation from external sources .",
    "the steady wind gets confined into a static photoionization - confined shell which could contain up to 35 per cent of all mass lost during the red supergiant phase .",
    "this gas shell is confined close to the star , giving a possibility of a type iin supernova resulting from a moderate mass red supergiant with standard mass - loss .",
    "a summary of the detected progenitors and their limits are illustrated in a hertzsprung russell diagram in figure[fig : hrd ] , along with a set of theoretical stellar evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "this represents a complete summary of the progenitors detected ( and limits set ) within the time and volume limit of @xcite and @xcite ( extended to all data published up to end of 2013 ) and hence the relative numbers and distribution of the stars in this plot are meaningful .",
    "the striking result is that there is a deficit of progenitors above an estimated luminosity of @xmath0 .",
    "there are 30 progenitors ( type ii detections , ii limits , iib and ib detections ) below this luminosity limit .",
    "the final luminosity of a supernova progenitor is determined by the he core mass and luminosity , and this luminosity equates to a slightly different mass depending on the stellar evolutionary models used .",
    "this @xmath0 equates to 16for the stars models of @xcite ; 16  for the rotating geneva models of ; 18  for the @xcite ( see figure[fig : endpoints ] ) and other stellar evolutionary codes produce model progenitors that are broadly in this range .    for a salpeter imf with @xmath70 , 70% of stars between 8 - 100",
    "are in the 8 - 18range . hence with this number of stars ( 30 ) lying below the mass limit of 18  one would expect to have found 13 higher mass progenitors with @xmath71dex and @xmath72 there is possibly one ( sn2009ip ; section[sec : iin ] ) , but the poissonian probability of finding between 0 and 1 , if the expectation value is 13 would be @xmath73 .",
    "the number 13 is a very close match to the number of ibc progenitors for which we have upper limits and one detection .",
    "one could argue that the bulk of stars above 18  evolve into wr stars and evade detection due to them being too hot and faint at the point of core - collapse .",
    "and the numbers would match ( almost too well ) .",
    "this is not strictly ruled out by any of the observational constraints to date but it appears to be unlikely .",
    "the three constraints of having no detected progenitors , the high relative rate of ibc sne and the low ejecta masses estimated from lightcurve fitting ( presented in section[sec : ibc ] ) all suggest that the binary channel dominates the production of type ibc sne .",
    "the missing high mass stars clearly exist in substantial numbers in starforming regions and we observe them following a salpeter ( or similar ) initial mass function",
    ". therefore the question is , why are they not detected as sn progenitors ?",
    "it does not appear likely that they are all wr stars that have evaded detection , given the arguments above .",
    "one argument put forward is a bias in detecting high mass stellar progenitors as they may exist in denser , younger starforming regions - dense clusters or associations .",
    "thus the surface brightness of these regions could make resolving individual stars more difficult .",
    "however there are only three known sne within the distance and time limit that fall on compact clusters .",
    "two of them sn2004am and sn2004dj are relatively old clusters and very unlikely to host stars of @xmath74 , @xcite and the other is sn1999ev which is also unlikely to be a very young cluster @xcite .",
    "it is also unlikely that these missing high mass progenitors stars produce normal luminosity sne that are systematically missed by nearby surveys because of surface brightness effects - since sn2004am was a relatively faint and reddened sn , recovered on top of a bright super star cluster in m82 @xcite . and",
    "sn2004dj was also easily detected in amateur surveys @xcite .",
    "it would appear that the sn population we observe in the local universe are not being produced , in large proportions , by stars with @xmath71 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "@xcite calculated the mass function of progenitors of type ii sne , assuming that there are no major biases in selecting the sne with progenitor information from the broader local sn population .",
    "this paper used a consistent approach , employing the stars models to attach an initial stellar mass to the luminosities and luminosity limits determined .",
    "they defined the  red supergiant problem \" which articulates the fact that while red supergiants are commonly found as direct progenitors of ii - p sne , there were no progenitors found above an estimated initial mass of around 17 , or @xmath0 .",

    "the lines are cumulative imfs with different minimum and maximum masses.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it is timely to review this in light of the discoveries made since 2009 and the increase in statistics now available and updated values using different methodologies .",
    "the luminosities compiled in this paper for detections and non - detections are used with three sets of models to estimate initial masses of the progenitor stars .",
    "the end points of three sets of models are plotted in figure[fig : endpoints ] showing the initial mass - final luminosity relation for the stars models @xcite , the rotating geneva models of and the kepler models of @xcite .",
    "the stars and rotating geneva models have quite similar final luminosities , hence we consider the results of these to be indistinguishable ( at least at the level of accuracy possible for any individual sn progenitor ) .",
    "the kepler models are less luminous at their endpoints by between @xmath79dex which typically translates into a difference in mass of 1 - 2 . in @xcite and other work that employed one set of stellar models ,",
    "the uncertainty in the theoretical models was taken into account by using luminosities at the end of the he burning .",
    "this was somewhat artificial and this review uses an alternative approach of taking the end points of three sets of evolutionary model grids .",
    "the estimated initial masses of the progenitors are listed in tables[tab : snii ] and [ tab : ii - lims ] .",
    "the masses for the three lowest luminosity progenitors ( sn2003gd , sn2005cs and sn2009md ) are uncertain in the kepler models , as this code does not yet have published endpoints for stars in the 8 - 10  regime .",
    "this is a problematic regime in that 2nd dredge up may occur , pushing the progenitors to higher luminosities than their more massive counterparts as discussed in @xcite and references there in .",
    "the quoted , but uncertain estimates from employing the kepler code are simply the extrapolated differences from the stars estimates .    as in @xcite",
    ", one can assume that the progenitors come from a mass function of some slope and take @xmath80 as a reliable standard .",
    "a maximum likelihood calculation can produce an estimate of the most likely lower mass and upper mass of the distribution , assuming the masses follow a salpeter function .",
    "for the masses estimated with the stars ( and rotating geneva ) models , the values determined ( using the same idl routine as employed in smartt et al .",
    "2009 ) are a minimum mass for the distribution of @xmath77 and a maximum mass of @xmath78 where the errors are the 95% confidence limits ( see figure[fig : maxlike ] ) .",
    "if we employ the kepler models , then the values are @xmath81 and a maximum mass of @xmath82 ( again with 95% confidence limits ) .",
    "these results are illustrated further in figure[fig : imf ] where the masses are plotted with a salpeter imf ( cumulative frequency function ) .",
    "the plots show that the mass distributions are comfortably reproduced with a standard imf between the lower and upper mass limits from the maximum likelihood calculations , but they need to be truncated at the higher mass .",
    "if one allows the mass function to vary up to say 30 , then the mass distribution can not be reproduced .",
    "this is the same basic result as shown in fig[fig : hrd ] - the population of progenitors is missing the high mass end of the distribution , but this time the imf is quantitatively considered .",
    "the maximum likelihood calculation is visualised in this cumulative frequency plot - given an imf slope , the line fit should go through the error bars of the detections and not conflict with any of the upper limits .    the lower mass limit to produce a core - collapse sn was estimated in @xcite to be @xmath83 from the same method and the sample to that point .",
    "reviewed the limits from the maximum masses of white dwarf progenitors , suggesting a convergence at @xmath84 .",
    "the two values estimated here slightly higher : the value from the stars models is @xmath77 ( integer mass models evolved through c - burning down to that mass have been calculated ) which is not significantly different to that estimated previously given the errors .",
    "the value from the kepler models is higher again , at @xmath81 .",
    "however low mass models ( 7 - 10 ) are not available from kepler and the values in this luminosity range were estimated assuming the same differential in luminosity between kepler and stars models exists between 7 - 10as at 11  ( figure[fig : endpoints ] ) .",
    "this is uncertain and the lower mass from kepler should not be treated as a quantitative estimate : @xmath85 is critically dependent on the mass estimates for the three lowest luminosity progenitors and if these are adjusted down by @xmath81then the value of @xmath86 would be reproduced .",
    "some further quantitative modelling of stars in this interesting mass range is required to reproduce the stellar luminosities and produce either a fe - core collapse or o - mg - ne core that collapses through electron capture . despite this uncertainty at the lower end",
    ", the existence of a high mass upper limit for type ii sne appears be secure .",
    "the value is model dependent of course , but the basic result is that type ii progenitors are statistically lacking above a @xmath0dex .",
    "the final model luminosities at this value are stars with @xmath87 ( 19  at 95% confidence ) for the stars and geneva models and @xmath88 ( 21.5  at 95% confidence ) for the kepler models .",
    "while @xcite first discussed this as thered supergiant problem \" , the lack of detected high mass progenitors is now a broader issue for all sn types .",
    "this broader issue of a lack of high mass progenitors generally was discussed in @xcite , who took all historical and literature limits to that date .",
    "the fact that there are now three type iib sne in our sample with progenitor detections ( table[tab : iib ] ) and these also have luminosities less than @xmath85.1dex illustrates that the missing high mass star problem is relevant for all type ii sne ( type",

    "we address the issue of type iin progenitors below .",
    "alternative methods of probing the mass function of sn progenitor stars have been recently advanced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these use similar methods of quantifying the stellar population around historical sne in galaxies closer than 8mpc and around sn remnants in m31 and m33 .",
    "they use high quality hubble space telescope imaging and careful stellar photometric measurements to determine the luminosity and masses of stars within the immediate vicinity of sne ( typically within 50pc ) .",
    "@xcite find that there is a lack of high mass stars close to the sn remnants in m31 and m33 , suggesting either the highest mass stars do not produce sne , or that snr surveys are biased against finding objects in the very youngest ( @xmath89myr old ) starforming regions .",
    "@xcite also suggest that their results are compatible with progenitors all coming from masses @xmath90  although the uncertainties do not rule out the possibility of no upper - mass cutoff .",
    "the reasons for these missing high mass progenitors are discussed as follows      as discussed in section[sec : iisum ] the extinction toward the progenitors is often estimated from the extinction toward the sn itself , or the nearby stellar population .",
    "the former estimates may not be directly applicable since the circumstellar dust around the progenitor stars can be destroyed in explosions - as in the case of sn2012aw and sn2008s .",
    "@xcite calculated the dust that could be produced in red supergiant winds and the extra extinction that this would produce .",
    "the idea is well motivated and valid , but @xcite showed that treating csm extinction with a slab of ism material is not physically consistent . as shown in @xcite , the progenitor of sn2012aw",
    "was thought to be quite a high mass star but correct treatment of radiative transfer in a spherical dust shell reduces the progenitor luminosity limit while comfortably fitting the optical , nir and mir detections and limits .",
    "the major concern for this sample is that the objects with limits only are effectively unconstrained - one could propose that these are all high mass objects enshrouded in dust and having no detection at any waveband does not allow meaningful constraints .",
    "however there is another important constraint which comes from x - ray and radio observations of type ii sne .",
    "@xcite considered a sample of six type ii - p sne with x - ray and radio observations .",
    "they estimated the mass - loss densities in the progenitor star s stellar wind from the thermal x - ray and radio synchrotron flux which originates when the fast moving sn ejecta interact with a pre - existing , lower velocity stellar wind from the progenitor star .",
    "the results for these six sne ( which are in the compilation presented here , either in table[tab : snii ] or [ tab : ii - lims ] ) , were consistent with the mass - loss expected for progenitor red supergiants in the mass range @xmath91 .",
    "@xcite has now compiled all the available literature x - ray detections for type ii - p sne and used the @xcite treatment of the free - free x - ray luminosity from the shocks produced by the sn ejecta and the stellar winds .",
    "red supergiant stars have observed mass - loss rates that span a wide range of values from @xmath92yr@xmath7 up to @xmath93yr@xmath7 .",

    "the x - ray luminosities imply mass - loss rates of less than @xmath97yr@xmath7 .",
    "the mass - loss rates of red supergiants are correlated with stellar luminosities and @xcite then used the relations ( @xmath98 ) to illustrate that type ii - p sne do not have high enough x - ray luminosities to have had progenitors significantly greater than @xmath99dex or 19 .",
    "similar arguments were used in @xcite specifically for the case of sn2012aw to show that the steady wind of @xmath100 to @xmath101yr@xmath7 was consistent with the x - ray and radio fluxes measured .",
    "the existence of obscuring csm dust can not exist without csm gas , in the form of stellar winds , with typical dust masses around @xmath102% that of the gas masses ( from the typical opacities in * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite shows that the iib and iil sne have typically higher x - ray luminosities than the ii - p , with values around @xmath103ergs@xmath7 ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with their higher luminosity progenitors , in the range of @xmath104dex .",
    "as remarked upon by @xcite the general agreement between the two independent methods is remarkably consistent .",
    "while dust obscuration should still be considered carefully for any progenitor and limit , it appears the sample as a whole is not significantly biased and there are no major discrepancies between the optical - nir luminosity and mass estimates of progenitors and the sn x - ray and radio fluxes .",
    "it is interesting to note that it is not just steady wind mass - loss that has been proposed to produce dense csm shells , and potentially extra extinction , around progenitors . @xcite",
    "have argued that after core neon burning , internal gravity waves can transport a super - eddington energy flux out into the stellar envelope and cause a mass ejection of around 1  of material .",
    "they suggest that this could occur preferentially in progenitors with @xmath10520   within a few months to a decade of core - collapse , with the most intense mass - loss occurring closer to core - collapse .",
    "this timescale is quite similar to the typical time differences between sn explosions and dates of progenitor detections .",
    "the dates of the observations of progenitors , or limits ( for the sne in tables 1 , 2 and 3 ) have a range of 2 months to 17 years before the sn discovery dates ( which one can assume is close to the explosion date to within @xmath8weeks at worst ) . the median and standard deviation of the time of data being taken before sn discovery are 65 and 54 months .",
    "it is possible that these ejection episodes could create dust shells , however the gas masses would be inconsistent with the x - ray and radio fluxes , as discussed for the steady mass - loss scenarios .",
    "there is no obvious correlation between probability of discovery and date of data taken , and some of the discoveries have images taken within 5 - 9 months before explosion ( e.g. 2003gd , 2005cs , 2008bk ) .",
    "an argument could be made that the observed limit that we see for red supergiant progenitors of @xmath106dex is not significantly lower , than the highest luminosity red supergiants of @xmath107dex @xcite and that uncertainties in the extinction and luminosity estimates from small numbers of broad band fluxes are high enough to argue that this is not a discrepancy at all .",
    "rather , this indicates broad and basic agreement ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion on careful model atmosphere techniques ) .",
    "however the increase in statistics now available , and the statistical and quantitative deficit of high luminosity progenitors as calculated in section[sec : massfunc ] would suggest that this is not a satisfactory answer .",
    "more broadly , the question then is - if there is no real  red supergiant problem \" , then where hertzsprung russell diagram ( hrd ) do these @xmath75  stars evolve to before the point of core - collapse and what sn do they produce ?",
    "they must end up with an iron core and , within the bounds of current theory , they must collapse .",
    "it does not appear that they can all produce wr stars and ibc sne for the reasons discussed in section[sec : ibc ] .",
    "the search for progenitors is not biased against any particular sn type , and the one ii - l progenitor ( sn2009kr ) , and the three iib progenitors do not have luminosities higher than the observed limit of 5.1dex . if high mass stars ( @xmath108 ) evolve to produce visible supernovae explosions , there is no obvious reason we should not detect both the supernovae and their progenitors , unless the sne themselves are intrinsically faint and have evaded either detection or recognition .",
    "the type iin sne have been suggested as a way out .",
    "high mass stars , with high mass - loss rates produce high enough csm gas masses that the sne are observed to be iin types .",

    "@xcite argue for quite a high relative rate of iin sne in the loss survey and that these would naturally have high mass progenitor stars .",
    "it seems almost certain that sne iin do come from high mass progenitors ( see section[sec : iin ] ) .",
    "some have detected progenitors ( as in sn2009ip and sn2005gl ) and they tend to have the largest x - ray and radio fluxes that require mass - loss rates which can not be realistically produced by low to moderate mass stars ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "other work has also hinted that there could be some systematic bias underlying the mass estimates from the direct detection of progenitors .",
    "hydrodynamic modelling of type ii - p sn lightcurves and velocity measurements has suggested a significant discrepancy between the sn ejected masses and the stellar masses of the progenitors .",
    "the detailed modelling of and for example has estimated ejecta masses for 5 type ii sne ( 1987a , 1999em , 2003z , 2005cs and 2004et ) which would imply initial stellar masses a factor of @xmath82 higher than those estimated from the progenitor luminosity and stellar evolutionary tracks .",

    "it is plausible to postulate that the reason for the missing high mass progenitors is that they produce failed sne that have , so far gone undetected ( or unrecognised ) in all of our efforts to find and quantify transients in the local universe . from a theoretical standpoint",
    "this is not surprising at all , the issue of explodability of the most massive stars has been a question since the 1980 s and 1990s .",
    "@xcite explored black hole formation through direct collapse and fall back and already suggested then that stars above 20   would produce black holes , possibly without a sn explosion .    the density profiles in stellar cores is a strong function of stellar mass , and recent work has revisited the idea that very massive stars may not produce detectable sne . as discussed in the introduction in @xcite the density gradient in more massive stars",
    "is relatively shallow , which will likely lead to higher accretion rates onto the compact object created at the point of collapse .",
    "it would also lead to higher  ram pressure \" which would need to be overcome by the shock ( through the neutrino energy deposition mechanism ) to launch a successful explosion through the star .",
    "the difficulty in getting successful simulated explosions has reinvigorated the study of the explodability of stars and in particular , three independent analyses by @xcite , @xcite @xcite and have used the compactness parameter ( defined in oconnor & ott ) which quantifies the core radius within which a certain amount of mass is confined in the final progenitor model @xmath109 where @xmath110 is in solar masses and @xmath111 is in units of 1000 km . defining @xmath112 for a value of 2.5  has been proposed .",
    "all three of these studies suggest that the compactness parameter is not a monotonically increasing and simple function of initial stellar mass .",
    "it will depend critically on mass - loss rate , internal mixing mechanisms in the stellar model not to mention metallicity and rotation ( and very likely mass - transfer in binaries will have similar effects to mass - loss ) .",
    "figure[fig : compactness ] is from @xcite showing the compactness @xmath112 at bounce , as a function of @xmath113 .",
    "the three studies all suggest that at critical values of @xmath114 , successful explosions are difficult to achieve .",
    "the figure illustrates that the compactness is dependent on the mass - loss recipes used in the stellar models , and that below @xmath115 , the stars are relatively easy to explode . however above that threshold , it becomes significantly more difficult to achieve explosions .",
    "there are what have been termed `` islands of explodability '' such that at some masses , the combination of mass - loss and final core structure may make it easier or hard to explode .",
    "what is constant in all these three studies is that above @xmath116 , one would expect to have failed explosions and that there will be a tendency for stars not to produce visible sne .",
    "it may be that there is not a one to one relation and there is no simple , single numerical mass threshold at which neutron star or black hole formation occurs .",
    "overall though , model stars above this threshold have a tendency to produce failed sne at the point of core - collapse whereas stars below it generally proceed to explosion . in the same spirit , @xcite have carried out an extensive series of simulations with more than 300 models and argue that a critical value of @xmath117 is the likely divide between successful and failed explosions .",
    "this would result in stars in the initial mass range @xmath118  not producing canonical sne .",
    "the observational constraints presented in this review can reasonably be explained , and in a quantitative manner , with this model framework .",
    "the search for progenitors has been more difficult than was first thought , with the dearth of high mass and high luminosity progenitors an inescapable fact .",
    "arguments can be made concerning dust , bias , and evolution to very faint wr stars but these have been addressed above .",
    "the reasonable agreement between the explosion theories based on the core compactness and the progenitor constraints mean they should be considered to be physically linked . as first noted by @xcite",
    "the prediction of this scenario is that many massive stars ( a fraction as high as @xmath119% ) end their lives by disappearing without a visible supernovae . as the dynamical timescale of a star of red supergiant dimensions is of order a year",
    ", these failed sne may give rise to faint , long lived red transients as proposed by @xcite .",
    "however @xcite proposed that a short timescale optical transient ( lasting 3 - 10 days ) with a faint luminosity of @xmath120ergs@xmath7 could be produced due to the breakout of a shock induced in the stellar envelope from neutrino losses in the core .",
    "@xcite have just presented the first results from their novel and ongoing survey for failed stars and this has turned up one plausible candidate that requires further investigation .",
    "one could reasonably argue that black hole forming cores and failed explosions are not controversial ideas , rather they are solid theoretical predictions that have been proposed for more than 15 years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite finds that the observed black hole mass function in the galaxy can be modelled by assuming that black hole formation ( and hence successful supernova explosion ) is determined by the core compactness parameter .",
    "all of this adds impetus to the searches of @xcite and surveys for transients in the local universe to identify the signatures that have been suggested by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a final note on this topic of the explosion mechanism is the potential of recent work to compare the ejecta velocities in successful sne to the progenitor mass estimates by @xcite .",
    "there appears to be a relation between the observed ejecta velocities , plateau duration and progenitor mass which could be explained if the energy deposition ( the kinetic energy observed in the ejected envelope ) is proportional to the initial mass of the progenitor cubed ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "if this analysis holds then it could be telling us something about the efficiency of the deposition process in a neutrino revived explosion .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the paucity of objects with low energy and large mass could support the idea of a population of failed sne .",

    "the key to this of course is having a reliable and sophisticated radiative transfer model that can reproduce the observed spectra and estimate element masses in the ejecta from the absolute and relative strengths of the emission lines .",
    "one of the leading codes for this has been developed by .",
    "there are others such as @xcite and @xcite which have been successfully applied .",
    "the jerkstrand et al .",
    "code , developed in stockholm , calculates the physical conditions in the expanding nebula and includes non - thermal heating , ionization , and excitation from the gamma - ray and positron energy deposition of @xmath34ni/@xmath34co ( and @xmath123co and @xmath124ti at later phases ) , and computes thermal and statistical equilibrium with the latest atomic data .",
    "it treats multi- line radiative transfer with a monte carlo technique and is being actively applied to those sne with progenitor detections and limits .",
    "these models can successfully reproduce the observed optical , near - ir and ( when available ) mid - ir spectra of type ii sne at late phases    in particular , the application to sn2012aw allows a self - consistent comparison of the progenitor luminosity and the oxygen produced . in a progenitor model , the stellar luminosity",
    "is determined by the he core luminosity .",
    "the he core size and burning rate dictates the oxygen production .",
    "thus a progenitor model which has been artificially exploded should be able to reproduce the oxygen line strengths and the final luminosity consistently .",
    "the physical sophistication of the code now allows this to be done to high accuracy .",
    "for sn2012aw the nebular phase spectra are in good agreement with the ejecta from a kepler model of @xmath125  progenitor star @xcite and the forbidden neutral oxygen lines can be used to constrain the mass of oxygen to be less than @xmath126 ( see figure[fig : lineflux ] ) .",
    "this provides a physically consistent match to the progenitor luminosity of a kepler model of the same mass ( 14 as in table[tab : snii ] and illustrated in figure[fig : endpoints ] ) .",
    "the [ oi ] line strengths ( and also the mgi and nai fluxes ) are strongly dependent on progenitor mass .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite is that to date , there is no convincing example of a type ii - p sn which displays the nucleosynthetic products expected from a @xmath74  progenitor in its nebular spectra ( see fig.[fig : lineflux ] ) .",
    "further modelled the nebular spectra of the iib sne 1993j , 2008ax and 2011dh and constrained the initial mass of the progenitors to be @xmath127  from the line strengths of the oxygen lines .",
    "together with progenitor detections , constraints on the mass - loss rates , these nebular spectra and the radiative transfer analysis there is a consistent picture that there are no type ii sne in the local universe which come from high mass progenitors . while the nebular spectral analysis provides the strong progenitor constraints useful for this review it is becoming a powerful way to probe the enrichment of sne and to allow quantitative checks on what role various sne play in galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "if all stars above a certain main - sequence mass do form black holes then they are not likely to eject the elements synthesised during stellar evolution .",
    "the important implications of this were recently studied by @xcite who found that the solar abundance pattern ( from oxygen to strontium , at @xmath12890 ) are fit well if there is no cut - off assumed .",
    "this calculation had all stars up to 120   produce successful supernovae and produce nucleosynthetic yields according to @xcite . if the limiting main sequence mass that produces a black hole and no supernova ( and therefore no enrichment ) is reduced to @xmath129  then the solar elemental abundance pattern is still comfortably reproduced .",
    "however there are unpalatable consequences if this mass limit is as low as @xmath130 , for which there is some direct evidence as discussed earlier in this review . for this limit to be compatible with the observed abundance pattern , @xcite",
    "show that the mass - loss rates should be lower than currently assumed ( to keep the carbon abundance under control ) , and the reaction rate for @xmath131 needs to be near the experimental maximum rate in order to reproduce the @xmath132process isotopes .",
    "in addition the historical supernova rate needs to be 3 times higher than that when no cut - off is assumed .",
    "the non - monotonic distribution of compactness discussed in section[sec : bh ] which results in some higher mass stars exploding in the islands of explodability would mitigate these problems .",
    "however that would require significant numbers of successful explosions above about 22 .",
    "one way out is that if supernovae from the most massive stars ( @xmath133 ) are successful in enrichment but are more often enshrouded in dust and invisible to current surveys .",
    "the discussion in section[sec : explain ] disfavours this scenario .",
    "searches for sne in very high starformation rate galaxies such as dusty luminous infra - red galaxies suggest that more than about 80% of expected core - collapse sne are missed in optical and near infra - red searches @xcite . for normal galaxies ,",
    "the missing fraction is more likely to be 10 - 15% ( again estimated in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and these missing sne would need to be from the most massive stars to explain the deficit of high mass progenitors and ease the tension with the elemental production budget",
    ". further work on searches for sne specifically in the radio and mid - ir searches would be required to tie this down securely .",
    "drawing together the observational results by the community over the period 1999 - 2013 , together with the theoretical concepts on exploding stars , the following conclusions are proposed    * there are 45 supernovae with either detected progenitors or upper limits in the volume limited sample and either none ( or one , if sn2009ip is included ) has a progenitor above the luminosity limit of @xmath0 ( or an equivalent initial mass of @xmath2 ) .",
    "a salpeter imf would suggest there should be 13 objects and the probability of finding 0 or 1 is @xmath73 . *",
    "the various possible biases that have been suggested to explain this deficit were explored in this review including circumstellar dust , selection bias and luminosity analysis errors .",
    "it does not seem likely that they can explain the deficit .",
    "* one possible explanation is that most , or nearly all , stars above @xmath1  evolve into wr stars that are hot and faint at the point of core - collapse when they produce ibc sne .",
    "however this ignores the growing evidence that the ibc sn population are produced mostly by binary systems with masses in the range @xmath134 .",
    "* explosion modelling by several theoretical groups actually predict that stars above the mass limit of @xmath2   have a tendency to produce failed sne and form black holes . above this limit",
    "there are islands of explodability that can produce neutron stars and successful explosions .",

    "* the nebular spectra of core - collapse sne which have identified progenitors is a new and powerful way to probe the progenitor mass range and nucleosynthesis in massive stars .",

    "<S> over the last 15 years , the supernova community has endeavoured to directly identify progenitor stars of core - collapse supernovae discovered in nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these precursors are often visible as resolved stars in high resolution images from space and ground based telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery rate of progenitor stars is limited by the local supernova rate and the availability and depth of archive images of galaxies , with 18 detections of precursor objects and 27 upper limits . </S>",
    "<S> this review compiles these results ( from 1999 - 2013 ) in a distance limited sample and discusses the implications of the findings . </S>",
    "<S> the vast majority of the detections of progenitor stars are of type ii - p , ii - l or iib with one type ib progenitor system detected and many more upper limits for progenitors of ibc supernovae ( 14 in all ) . the data for these 45 supernovae progenitors illustrate a remarkable deficit of high luminosity stars above an apparent limit of @xmath0dex . for a typical salpeter initial mass function , one would expect to have found 13 high luminosity and high mass progenitors by now . </S>",
    "<S> there is , possibly , only one object in this time and volume limited sample that is unambiguously high mass ( the progenitor of sn2009ip ) although the nature of that supernovae is still debated . </S>",
    "<S> the possible biases due to the influence of circumstellar dust , the luminosity analysis , and sample selection methods are reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> it does not appear likely that these can explain the missing high mass progenitor stars . </S>",
    "<S> this review concludes that the community s work to date shows that the observed populations of supernovae in the local universe are not , on the whole , produced by high mass ( @xmath1 ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical explosions of model stars also predict that black hole formation and failed supernovae tend to occur above an initial mass of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the models also suggest there is no simple single mass division for neutron star or black - hole formation and that there are islands of explodability for stars in the @xmath3  range . </S>",
    "<S> the observational constraints are quite consistent with the bulk of stars above @xmath1  collapsing to form black holes with no visible supernovae .    </S>",
