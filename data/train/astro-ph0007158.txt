    "the optical depths measured in the rosat and asca spectra using phenomenological 2-edge models , are similar to one another ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "neutral absorption has not been unambiguously found in this source .",
    "while the 1979 _ einstein _ observation ( kruper , urry & canizares 1990 ) did not detect absorption by neutral gas , a subsequent low energy resolution exosat observation in 1985 showed the presence of cold gas , with n@xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath2 affecting the low energy spectrum ( ghosh & soundararajaperumal 1991 ) .",
    "a 1989 _ ginga _ observation ( simultaneous to iue , kolman et al 1993 ) , showed a low energy cutoff of the intrinsic power law , indicating heavy absorption of the nuclear continuum along the line of sight .",
    "however , due to the limited energy coverage of _ ginga _ ( 2 - 20 kev bandpass ) it was not possible to establish the ionization state of that absorber , which was consistent with either a high column of neutral gas ( @xmath12= 4@xmath13 @xmath2 ) or a lower column of more highly ionized gas .",
    "in this paper we present data from two broad band bepposax ( boella et al .",
    "1997a ) observations of ngc  3516 .",
    "preliminary results were presented by stirpe et al .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 and  3",
    "we present our analysis of the data , while in  4 we discuss our main results .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in  5 .",
    "ngc  3516 was detected with a good signal - to - noise ratio in the three main narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on bepposax , spanning 0.1 - 120 kev . in table 1",
    "dates and exposure times of the two bepposax observations of ngc  3516 are presented , along with the source count rates measured in the lecs ( parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) , mecs ( boella et al .",
    "1997b ) and pds ( frontera et al .",
    "data from these three instruments were screened following standard criteria , as detailed in fiore , guainazzi & grandi ( 1999 ) . in particular , pds data were screened using fixed rise - time thresholds .",
    "data from the three mecs units were merged to improve the statistics .",
    "the scientific products for the analysis are extracted from the equalized event files , using both the standard ftools package ( vs. 4.2 ) and the new release ( vs. 1.1 ) of the ciao ( chandra interactive analysis of observation ) software ( elvis et al .",
    "lecs and mecs source counts were extracted from circular regions of 6 radius , centered on the source . the same extraction regions were used to extract background counts from the long exposure `` blank - fields '' provided by the bepposax science data center .",
    "pds source and background counts were collected , respectively , during the on- and off - source modes of the instrument .",
    "for all the instruments , spectra were binned following the instrumental resolutions and allowing a maximum of 3 channels per resolution element .",
    "ngc  3516 underwent moderate ( factor of 1.52 ) 0.110 kev flux variations during both bepposax observations ( on a timescale of hours ) , however the ratios of the soft ( 0.12 kev ) to the hard ( 210 kev ) lightcurves were consistent with being constant , indicating no significant spectral variability across these energy bands on a 1-day timescale ( the duration of each observation ) .    a dramatically different behaviour was observed on the longer 4 months timescale between the two observations , during which the source experienced strong spectral variability . the 0.12 kev count rate increased by a factor of @xmath144 , while the corresponding increase in the 2 - 10 kev band was only of 1.9 ( table 1 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the model - independent ratio between the raw lecs ( 0.12 kev ) , mecs ( 1.5 - 10 kev ) and pds ( 13 - 100 kev ) spectra for the two bepposax observations ( 1996 november / 1997 march ) .",
    "the amplitude of non - linear effects in the responses of the nfis ( potentially affecting the results of such an analysis ) is , at all energies , much smaller than the amplitude of the features visible in this ratio ( boella et al .",
    "1997b , parmar et al .",
    "1997 , frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in the ratio in figure 1 ,",
    "the 15 kev energy band is a smoothly increasing function of energy .",
    "it then flattens at e@xmath15 kev , around a value of @xmath16 . in the pds band",
    "the ratio is @xmath140.8 .",
    "this implies a steepening of the ratio between 10 and 13 kev .",
    "a sharp emission feature around 1 kev is visible superimposed on these smooth changes .",
    "all this strongly suggests that some , and perhaps all , of the several components that make up the 0.1 - 100 kev spectrum of ngc  3516 varied independently of each other from one observation to the other . in particular , the smooth and monotonic rising of the ratio up to @xmath17 kev , along with its flattening above this energy and up to 10 kev , suggest a drastic decrease in the degree of obscuration of the central x - ray source between the two observations rather than an intrinsic variation of the slope of the primary x - ray continuum . in this case",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath16 around which the ratio flattens above @xmath17 kev , would be the intensity increase factor of the intrinsic x - ray power law between the two observations .",
    "the higher pds count ratio of @xmath140.8 may suggest a higher relative intensity of a compton - reflection component in the 1997 observation .",
    "there is no clear indication for a similar effect at the energy of the fe k line .",
    "the emission feature at @xmath18 kev may be the signature of iron l emission , visible only during the 1996 observation , and therefore either external to the nuclear environment , and detectable by the bepposax lecs only when the soft nuclear continuum was heavily obscured , or internal to that , but only partially obscured by the amount of neutral ( or mildly ionized ) gas obscuring the x - ray source in 1996 .",
    "intrinsic variation of the intensity of the fe - l complex in the hot plasma is , of course , a further possibility .",
    "we use this scenario to guide the modelling and fitting of the spectra in the following sections .",
    "we have performed global modeling and fitting of the 0.1 - 150 kev spectra of both bepposax observations of ngc  3516 using the xspec 10.0 package . in table 2",
    "we summarize the results of this analysis .",
    "errors are quoted at 90% confidence level , for one interesting parameter ( i.e. @xmath19 , avni 1976 ) .",
    "the cosmology used is h@xmath20=50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and q@xmath20=0.5 .",
    "for all the absorption ( neutral and/or ionized ) models that we use in this paper we adopt solar abundances as estimated by grevesse and anders ( 1989 ) and grevesse and noels ( 1993 ) .",
    "photoionization models for fitting purposes include photoelectric absorption but not resonant absorption and gas emission , and have been built following nicastro et al .",
    "finally , we use pure compton reflection models built by running iteratively the routine pexrav ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) for the inclination angle of 30@xmath21 ( consistent with the best fit interval measured , see  3.1.3 ) and a range of values of the slope @xmath22 of the incident continuum and the e - folding energy @xmath23 of the high energy exponential cut - off . for fitting purposes we always combine the compton reflection model with a cut - off power law , linking the two @xmath22 and @xmath23 to the same values , and leaving the two normalizations free to vary independently .",
    "we first fitted the 1996 november and 1997 march spectra ( hereinafter n96 and m97 ) with a model consisting of a power law plus galactic absorption ( n@xmath24= 3.4@xmath25 @xmath2 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "both fits are very poor ( @xmath26 ) , and the best fit photon indices are different : @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the residuals clearly show the presence of several additional non - modelled spectral features ( figure 2a and b ) .",
    "some are common to both spectra : ( a ) a line - like feature at @xmath29 kev , ( b ) a deficit of counts at @xmath30 kev , and ( c ) a systematic deviation across the pds band . however ,",
    "at low energy , ( e@xmath31 kev ) the shapes of the residuals are quite different from one spectrum to the other .",
    "our best fitting parameterizations of n96 and m97 are thus quite different , and are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the two best fitting models ( hereinafter 96bf and 97bf respectively ) include several common components , which make up our `` base model '' : ( a ) a power law with a high energy cut - off ; ( b ) a neutral absorber ( to account for galactic absorption along the line of sight ) ; ( c ) a hot photoionized absorber ( ha , see table 2 ) , parameterized by a column density @xmath32 and an ionization parameter u ( to account for the 8 kev deficit ) ; ( d ) a gaussian emission line ( to account for k@xmath33 iron fluorescence ) ; ( e ) a pure compton - reflection component ( limited to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as noted earlier ) . however , n96 and m97 differ from each other in requiring additional components that are not held in common : ( f ) a neutral absorber only partially obscuring the direct view of the primary x - ray power law and ( g ) soft emission by an optically thin plasma , for the n96 spectrum , and ( h ) a second , more mildly ionized absorber , for the m97 spectrum .",
    "our estimates for the parameter values of our `` base model '' were consistent with each other between the 96bf and the 97bf parameterizations ( see table 2 ) .",
    "in the following we describe and discuss the individual components of this model referring to the numerical results obtained for the m97 spectrum , the one with higher statistics .      the 0.1100 kev primary continuum of ngc  3516 is well described by a simple power law @xmath34 ( f(e ) in ph s@xmath3 @xmath2 kev@xmath3 ) with @xmath35 ( table 2 ) .",
    "this component varied in flux by @xmath36 between the two observations ( i.e. a(n96)/a(m97 ) = 0.6 ) , without changing in shape .",
    "we then conclude that little , if any , of the dramatic spectral variability experienced by the source can be due to variation of the primary continuum , either in shape or intensity .",
    "we could only estimate a lower limit ( e@xmath37 kev ) on the @xmath38-folding energy of the high energy cut - off , and were not able to measure any significant change of this parameter , between the two observations .      both the iron line and the compton - reflection components were required by our data at high significance .",
    "removing each of these components , one at time , from the 97bf model and refitting the data gives , respectively ( with @xmath39 indicating the number of free parameters eliminated by the 97bf model ) : @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the best fit energy of the iron emission line ( e = @xmath44 kev ) is consistent with that of fei - xxii k@xmath33 transitions .",
    "when modelled with a simple gaussian ( as in our adopted best fitting parameterization 97bf ) , the line is consistent with being narrow , with a 90% upper limit on its width of 0.27 kev .",
    "we note that the energy resolution of the bepposax - mecs is only of @xmath45 ev at 6.4 kev .",
    "furthermore , an accurate determination of the exact shape of the iron line profile is hampered by the presence in the data of the @xmath46 kev edge - like absorption feature .",
    "however , we have checked the consistency of our data with more complex scenarios , replacing the gaussian emission line in the 97bf model , with a relativistically broadened and distorted emission line from the accretion disk ( the model diskline in xspec : fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) , as suggested by previous asca observations ( nandra et al .",
    "1997a,1999 ) .",
    "we fixed the internal radius on the accretion disk at 6 gravitational radii , the energy of the emission line centroid at 6.33 kev ( the best fit energy in 97bf ) and the spectral index of the emissivity law at -2 , and refitted the data .",
    "the result was inconclusive .",
    "we obtained the same @xmath47 as in 97bf .",
    "the outer radius on the disk was only barely constrained and larger than 11.5 gravitational radii .",
    "all the other model parameters were consistent within the errors with the 97bf measurements",
    ". we also checked the extreme hypothesis that all of the negative residuals visible in figure 2 at @xmath46 kev could be explained in terms of a very distorted blue - profile of the iron line , eliminating the ha component and refitting the data .",
    "this yielded a worse @xmath48 than 97bf ( @xmath49 , for @xmath41 ) , and accounted only partially for the absorption feature at @xmath46 kev .",
    "we then conclude that a relativistically broadened and distorted emission line profile with no fexvii - xxii k absorption is not a necessary component for the description of our data .",
    "thanks to the broad band of bepposax we were able to detect a bump in the 10 - 30 kev data ( see figure 2a and 2b ) .",
    "we model this bump as due to compton reflection of the primary power law off a slab of almost neutral matter re - radiating the isotropic incident x - ray continuum . during both the 1996 and 1997 observations we measured relative fractions of reflection",
    "consistent with each other ( table 2 ) , and fully consistent with the value of 1 corresponding to a solid angle of 0.5 as seen by a central isotropic source of primary radiation .",
    "their ratio , @xmath50 , is consistent with the value derived in  2.1 from our model independent analysis .",
    "if the same matter were also producing the k@xmath33 fluorescence iron line ( but see also  2.1 ) , we would expect the equivalent width of this line to be @xmath14100 - 150 ev ( e.g. mushostzky , done & pounds 1993 ) , consistent with the measured value ( see table 2 ) .",
    "both the n96 and m97 spectra of ngc  3516 show a clear absorption feature around 8 kev ( figure 2 ) .",
    "a neutral reflection component alone can not explain the edge feature at @xmath148 kev , even allowing the inclination disk parameter to vary in a wide range ( from 0@xmath21 to 60@xmath21 ) .",
    "we accounted for this feature by including a hot photoionized absorber ( ha ) in 96bf and 97bf , obscuring the line of sight .",
    "the same model was used for ngc  3516 to fit the absorption feature detected at the same energy ( e@xmath148 kev ) by _ ginga _ ( kolman et al .",
    "we stress again that the model used to fit the data includes neither gas emission , nor resonant absorption . removing this component from both 96bf and 97bf and refitting the data , gives respectively @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for @xmath53 .    the best fitting parameters u and @xmath32 do not vary ( within the errors ) between the two observations ( table 2 ) , and their values indicate that a high column density ( @xmath54 @xmath2 , very similar to the value found by kolman @xmath55 @xmath2 ) of highly ionized ( u = 224@xmath56 ) gas is absorbing the primary continuum of ngc  3516 in both data sets . in such an absorber elements lighter than oxygen and neon",
    "are fully ionized , and therefore do not imprint any visible features on the emerging spectrum .",
    "however , iron is still not fully ionized and contributes strongly to the opacity of the absorber at the energies of the photoelectric k and l absorption edges of fexvii - xxii .",
    "absorption by fexvii - xxii k imprints deep absorption edges at @xmath57 kev on the emerging spectrum , while l absorption by the same species affects the whole 1 to 5 kev band , gently flattening a low - resolution spectrum rather than producing visible sharp and resolved single absorption features on it ( unless fe - l resonant absorption lines dominate on recombination lines ) .",
    "fitting low resolution data with a phenomenological single - edge model , accounting for the @xmath46 kev absorption feature , would result in a wrong estimate of the slope of the intrinsic 0.1 - 100 kev power law , which would appear to be flatter by @xmath58 .",
    "ionized , and possibly relativistically smeared , edge - like features at energies @xmath597.1 kev have often been detected in the hard / low state of galactic black hole candidates , where the accretion disk is supposed to be hotter than that of agns by a factor @xmath1430 ( done & @xmath60ycki 1999 , ross et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this contest , to further test the uniqueness of our interpretation , we applied an ionized reflection model , which possibly can also account for an ionized edge - feature , to our data .",
    "the @xmath61 between a model with an ionized reflection ( model pexriv in xspec , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) and the best fit ( bf ) is @xmath62=25/1 and @xmath62=23/2 if the iron abundance parameter is left free to vary .",
    "the variation of the inclination angle of the ionized reflector ( @xmath63 ) does not influence the @xmath64 test .",
    "moreover , the expected ionized iron line at 6.7 kev , consistent with the ionization degree of the edge , is not detected , even though a ionized line could have been missed due to the low resolution instrument .",
    "the preferred interpretation is thus in terms of a high ionization , high column density absorber which can simultaneously account for both the @xmath148 kev edge and the overall continuum shape at medium energies and , most important , it provides the statistically better description of the available data .",
    "as pointed out in  3 the `` base model '' does not provide a fully satisfactory description of either the n96 or the m97 spectra .",
    "additional components are present in our best fitting parametrizations 96bf and 97bf .",
    "we describe them in the following two sections .",
    "to model the 0.1 - 5 kev residuals of figure 2b , we added to our `` base model '' a neutral absorber of column density @xmath12 which only covers a fraction c@xmath65 of the nuclear x - ray source .",
    "fitting the n96 data with this model produces a significative improvement in the @xmath48 ( @xmath66 ) and gives n@xmath67 @xmath2 and @xmath68 .",
    "( we note that using an ionized absorber model the ionization parameter is consistent to be zero , while the column density of the warm gas is @xmath69 , indicating absorption by neutral gas as the most likely explanation ) .",
    "nevertheless , the residuals continue to show a clear line - like unresolved feature around 1 kev ( figure 3 , upper panel ) .    at this energy , recombination l lines from fexvii - xxiv are expected to strongly contribute to the emission from either a collisionally ionized plasma ( cip ) with a temperature of @xmath70 kev , or from a photoionized plasma ( pip ) with a high ionization degree ( u@xmath71 ) and column density ( @xmath72 ) . only for fitting purposes ,",
    "we use here a cip model , while a more accurate discussion on the physics of this component and on its possible identification is deferred to  4.2 .",
    "we added a cip component ( the model mekal in xspec , mewe , gronenschild & van den oord 1985 ) to our model , and refitted the data .",
    "the fit is again significatively improved by the addition of this component ( @xmath73 , for 2 additional parameters : model 96bf ) , and the residuals are now flat over the entire 0.1 - 100 kev band .",
    "the best fit temperature of this collisional plasma is @xmath74 kev .",
    "the covering factor of the neutral gas is now larger ( @xmath75 ) than in the previous fit , indicating that only a small or null fraction of the nuclear radiation escapes absorption .",
    "our `` base model '' did not provide a satisfactory description for the m97 spectrum either .",
    "several features remained at e@xmath76 kev as shown by the residuals in figure 3b ( bottom panel ) .",
    "these strongly suggest the presence of a typical `` warm '' absorber obscuring the line of sight and imprinting deep ovii and oviii k edges , at 0.74 and 0.87 kev ( see reynolds 1997 , george et al .",
    "1998 ) . for this source",
    "the signature of a complex `` warm '' absorber had been previously detected by rosat - pspc and asca ( mwa97 , kriss et al . , 1996b ) .",
    "we then added a photoionized absorber component to our `` base model '' and refitted the m97 data .",
    "the residuals are now flat over the entire bepposax band , and the reduced @xmath48 is 0.90 ( table 2 : 97bf model ) .",
    "the 1996 november spectrum of ngc  3516 is heavily absorbed by almost neutral gas which covers most of the primary continuum source , ( here we choose c@xmath77 , the best fit value obtained fitting the soft emission with the cip component ,  3.2.1 ) , and whose equivalent hydrogen column density ( as derived by a fit with a neutral absorber ) is as large as @xmath78 ( exceeding the galactic value by almost two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "this value would be even larger if the gas were mildly ionized ( oii - iii dominating ) .",
    "there is no evidence for variation of the degree of obscuration of this gas during the observation ( @xmath1420 hours ) and this component is not required by the 1997 march data ( 4 months later ) , , absorber is needed in 1997 : see  4.1.2 . ] and the uv continuum of this source in a hst / fos observation taken @xmath79 day after the 1996 november bepposax observation ( gea99 ) shows no marked extinction by dust ( assuming a galactic gas / dust ratio we should expect @xmath80 mag , for @xmath81 , gorenstein , 1975 ) .",
    "all this allows us to put constraints on the geometry and the physical state of this component , and to speculate on different possible scenarios .",
    "the typical timescale of variability of the x - ray continuum ( e.g. nandra et al .",
    "1997b ) gives an upper limit on the linear size of the emitting region : @xmath82 cm . in order for an homogeneous cloud of absorbing gas to cover almost the entire primary emitting region ,",
    "either the cloud is at a distance @xmath83 close to the central source , comparable to @xmath84 , and its linear sizes @xmath85 are comparable and/or larger than @xmath84 , or @xmath83 is much larger than @xmath84 and the source appears point - like as seen by the cloud .",
    "photoionization arguments strongly support the second picture .",
    "in fact , assuming @xmath86 gives an ionization parameter u@xmath59 2500 n@xmath87 , where n@xmath88 is the electron density of the gas in units of 10@xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "we used the ionizing luminosity of ngc  3516 , derived assuming the 2200   flux and @xmath91 from george et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and x - ray fluxes and spectral shape from our data .",
    "such an ionization parameter would be associated to almost neutral gas ( u@xmath92 : oxygen distributed between oi - oiii ) only for implausibly high electron densities m@xmath93 , accreting at 0.1 - 0.01 times the critical rate , and in proximity of the last stable orbit . ]",
    "more plausible electron densities of @xmath95 , as those estimated for the broad emission line clouds ( belcs ) in agns ( netzer 1991 , ferland et al .",
    "1992 , krolik et al .",
    "1991 ) , would result in very highly ionized gas , which is inconsistent with our data .",
    "we then assume that @xmath96 .",
    "reverberation mapping studies of the bels in ngc  3516 ( wanders et al .",
    "1993 ) have estimated a distance @xmath97 of the belcs from the source of ionizing continuum , of @xmath98 _ ld _ ( @xmath99 cm ) , supporting the possibility that the gas obscuring the x - ray continuum of ngc  3516 in 1996 is associated with a belc . at this distance , and assuming @xmath100 , the ionization parameter measures u@xmath101 , and the gas is only mildly ionized and therefore compatible with the nature of the absorption seen in the x - ray band in 1996 .",
    "all this suggests that a belc crossing our line of sight could have caused the obscuration of the x - ray primary source in 1996 . as a consistency check",
    "we can calculate the time @xmath102 needed for a belc to cross our line of sight .",
    "assuming as transverse velocity @xmath103 , the measured h@xmath104 fwhm of 4,000 km s@xmath3 ( wanders , et al , 1993 ) , we obtain @xmath105 ( where @xmath85 is the linear size of the cloud ) . for the measured n@xmath106",
    ", we have then @xmath107 s. since we know that @xmath102 must be longer than 20 hours ( the duration of the 1996 observation ) and shorter than @xmath108 months ( the time elapsed between the two bepposax observations ) , the above equation constrains the electron density of the gas to the range @xmath109 , we stress again that , if the gas were mildly ionized ( as is the case for the belcs ) , then we would be underestimating the equivalent n@xmath110 obtained fitting the data with a neutral absorber model and therefore the interval of densities given above would shift towards higher values .",
    "this range of densities contains the estimated belc value .",
    "a much narrower interval could in principle be set using the time elapsed between the 1996 november observation and the last hst / fos observation of gea99 ) , showing no mgii resonant absorption nor extinction in the uv continuum , in @xmath111 days .",
    "this would give a lower limit on the density of @xmath112 .",
    "in the framework of the proposed scenario , a belc crossing the line of sight , we estimated the probability of such an event , based on an estimate of the filling factor of the belcs .",
    "the total volume of a sphere with radius @xmath97 is @xmath113 . from the luminosity of the broad h@xmath104 of ngc  3516 , l@xmath114 ( rosenblatt et al .",
    "1994 ) , we can estimate the effective volume occupied by all the belcs , given by : + @xmath115 . for an electronic temperature t@xmath116 of @xmath117",
    "k , at the energy of the h@xmath104 emission line , the recombination coefficent @xmath118 is @xmath143.4@xmath119 erg @xmath120 s@xmath3 ( osterbrock 1989 ) and @xmath121 ( netzer 1991 ) .",
    "we then obtain @xmath122 .",
    "the probability for a cloud to find itself along a particular line of sight at any radius is then given by @xmath123 .",
    "this low probability supports the picture of an event which occurs very rarely , as indeed observed in agn ( kruper , urry & canizares 1990 ) .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that the ionization state of the absorber varied between the two bepposax observations , becoming more ionized , and therefore transparent to the soft x - ray radiation . in this scenario",
    "we may speculate that the `` warm '' absorber seen in the 1997 march spectrum of ngc  3516 is the same gas which was obscuring the line of sight 4 months earlier , but with a very different ionization degree .",
    "the same picture was drawn for this source by mwa97 who proposed a model for a variable `` warm '' absorber in ngc  3516 to reconcile the uv and the x - ray spectra within a unique scenario ( see also next section ) . in the mwa97 model",
    "the presence and subsequent disappearance of a broad civ absorption component at 1549  was consistent with a variable state x - ray absorber , from mildly ionized during the 1989 _ ginga _ observation to highly ionized in subsequent rosat - pspc and asca observations .    in the framework of the scenario above described , we derived some dynamical properties of this variable state absorber . at a given ionizing flux ,",
    "the ionization degree of a photoionized absorber can vary due to variations of the distance of the gas from the ionizing source , or of the electron density in the gas ( or both ) . in the first of these two extreme hypotheses we assume that the absorber has a constant density in the range @xmath124 ( typical of `` warm '' absorbers in seyfert 1s : nicastro et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , mwa97 ) .",
    "the gas is almost neutral during the 1996 november observation , which gives an upper limit on its ionization parameter of @xmath125 , above this value , and for the ionizing continuum shape of ngc  3516 , the opacity of the gas at low x - ray energies drops drastically .",
    "this gives a range of possible distances from the central source of @xmath126 cm ( the larger the density the smaller the lower limit on @xmath83 ) .",
    "if the gas were moving toward the central source with a radial velocity @xmath127 , keeping its density constant , it should have required less than @xmath128 months to cover the distance @xmath129 needed for its ionization parameter to increase by a factor of @xmath7 ( to reach the values observed during the 1997 november observation ) .",
    "the estimated radial velocity of the gas is thus @xmath130 .",
    "this limit would become even higher if the cloud became denser while collapsing toward the central source .",
    "we note that the most direct implication of this extreme hypothesis is that uv and high resolution x - ray spectra of sy  1 galaxies , during such relatively shorts events , should show highly redshifted resonant absorption lines with varying strenght .",
    "such phenomenon has never been observed so far .",
    "alternatively , the change in the ionization state of the absorber might be a result of a change in density ( as in mwa97 ) . to change from an almost neutral state ( u0.01 ) to a warm state ( @xmath131 ) would require a drop in density ( u@xmath132 ) by a factor of 500 .",
    "for example , the density of a belc would have to change from a few 10@xmath89 @xmath90 to about @xmath133 @xmath90 .",
    "a column density of @xmath134 @xmath2 and a density of 10@xmath89 @xmath90 imply a thickness of @xmath135 cm for the cold absorber .",
    "similarly , the thickness of the warm cloud would be about @xmath136 cm .",
    "such an expansion has to occur on a time scale of 4 months .",
    "if the cloud is expanding adiabatically , its velocity dispersion would then have to be about 500 km s@xmath3 .",
    "such a velocity dispersion is observed in associated absorption lines in agn , so the derived value is completely reasonable .",
    "we conclude that a scenario based on a variable state absorber is plausible ( see  4.3 for further details ) . unfortunately",
    ", no other x - ray observation was performed between the two bepposax pointings to further constrain the variability time scale in the soft x - ray energy band .",
    "both cases discussed above were based on the assumption of no changes of the intensity of the photoionizing continuum .",
    "variations of the ionizing flux could have contributed to the observed changes of the ionization degree of the gas . if , between the two observations , the continuum increased by a factor of @xmath7 and then recovered the level measured during the 1997 observation , then the gas could have been almost instantaneously ionized by this dramatic event , but not yet had enough time to recombine to its equilibrium neutral state .",
    "alternatively , the flux level seen during the 1996 observation could have been preceeded by a long duration event of very low intensity which caused the gas to recombine to an almost neutral state .",
    "the gas during the 1996 observation would then be underionized with respect to the observed ionizing continuum level .",
    "both cases would require low electron densities of the absorber ( @xmath137 @xmath90 , see nicastro et al .",
    "1999 , for details ) .",
    "two apparently unrelated spectral features are clearly visible in the n96 spectrum of ngc  3516 : ( a ) soft emission ( with a hump at @xmath18 kev ) , not obscured ( or only partly obscured ) by the amount of neutral gas covering the primary x - ray source , and ( b ) the signature of heavy absorption by highly ionized gas at @xmath46 kev . in our spectral analysis of n96",
    "we modeled these two features as due to two distinct components : a collisionally ionized emitting plasma and a photoionized absorber , respectively .",
    "extended emission by the host galaxy surrounding the agn has frequently been observed in seyferts : e.g. elvis et al . (",
    "1990 ) , wilson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , weaver et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . however , in the particular case of ngc  3516 , the extended component was probably unresolved by the rosat - hri ( morse et al .",
    "wilson et al . ( 1996 ) found that in their sample ( which includes ngc  3516 ) the 0.12.5 kev intrinsic luminosity of the extended components ranges between @xmath138 and @xmath139 . in the present data we measure @xmath140 erg s@xmath3 , a value only marginally consistent with the observed range , even allowing for intrinsic variability .",
    "based on the correlations found between far infrared ( fir ) and 2 kev luminosity of bright spiral galaxies ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1988 ) , we also compared the 2 kev luminosity @xmath141 erg s@xmath3 kev@xmath3 measured , with the mean @xmath142 value for the 11 objects of the fabbiano et al .",
    "( 1988 ) sample with @xmath143 erg @xmath5 .",
    "this range includes the value of @xmath144 erg @xmath5 obtained for ngc  3516 ( bonatto & pastoriza 1997 ) .",
    "we found @xmath145 , again much lower than measured in our data .",
    "we then conclude that the soft x - ray emission visible in 1996 , can not be entirely due to an extended component in the host galaxy .",
    "an intriguing alternative is that both the @xmath46 kev absorption edges visible in n96 and m97 and the soft emission in n96 could be self - consistently accounted for by a unique photoionized absorber / emitter in the nuclear environment of ngc  3516 .",
    "if photoionized , this gas has a temperature of @xmath146 k , and iron ( the lightest abundant element not yet fully ionized ) is smoothly distributed between fexvii and fexxvi . due to the high temperature",
    "the emissivity of this gas is large and contributes to the overall spectrum in an amount which depends linearly on its covering factor around the central source . in particular ,",
    "a strong contribution by fexvii - xxiv l recombination lines is expected at @xmath18 kev , where a clear emission feature is present in the n96 spectrum .",
    "models for photoionized gas accounting for gas emission , other than photoelectric and resonant absorption , can then be used to constrain the geometrical configuration of the observed absorber / emitter .    in the following we try to test this hypothesis quantitatively .",
    "the basic assumptions of this hypothesis are : ( a ) the neutral absorber in 1996 covered almost entirely ( @xmath147 % , as from the fit with the cip component , ",
    "3.2.1 ) , the nuclear source of primary x - rays but left uncovered a much larger fraction @xmath148 of the extended nuclear environment ( i.e. the warm and hot scattering media ) which is seen through scattering of the primary continuum ; ( b ) during the 1997 observation both the primary nuclear continuum and the reprocessed components are seen directly ( c ) no other component can significantly contribute to the line emission .",
    "we proceeded to build ( following nicastro et al .",
    "2000 ) two series of photoionization models , which include gas emission and resonant absorption , for the two ionized absorbers observed in ngc  3516 .",
    "we used column densities and ionization parameters as measured fitting the n96 and m97 spectra with models accounting for photoelectric absorption only ( table 2 ) .",
    "we built these models for a number of values of the covering factors @xmath149 and @xmath150 as seen by the central source , varying from 0 to 1 , and for particular values of outflowing ( @xmath151 ) and microturbulence ( @xmath152 ) velocities of the absorbers / emitters .",
    "in particular we used @xmath153 km s@xmath3 , @xmath154 km s@xmath3 ( observed in the uv for the broad civ system of ngc  3516 , kolman et al .",
    "1993 ) , and @xmath155 km s@xmath3,@xmath156 km s@xmath3 . for the `` hot '' absorber",
    "the adopted ratio @xmath157 maximizes the contribution of line emission compared to resonant absorption ( nicastro et al .",
    "the particular choice of the absolute values of @xmath158 and @xmath152 , separately , is however not critical .",
    "the warm component was not included in the models for the n96 spectrum , since we did not see it in the data ( which can be either because the component was not present or because it was completely obscured by the amount of almost neutral gas covering the line of sight during that observation ) .",
    "we also neglected the emission contribution from this gas .",
    "however given the temperature and ionization degree measured in 1997 ( in the photoionization hypothesis ) , emission of the warm component is expected to be very weak , and should influence mostly the 0.5 - 0.6 kev portion of the spectra where weak ovii and oviii emission lines are expected .",
    "this contribution would be hardly detectable with bepposax ( nicastro et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the hot component has been instead included in both models .",
    "we held @xmath150 constant between the two observations . for the `` cold '' absorber in 1996",
    ", we used the best fit column density and @xmath159 from table 2 .",
    "we did not fit these models directly to the n96 and m97 spectra , but proceeded as follows .",
    "we varied the values of the three parameters @xmath150 , @xmath149 and @xmath160 to let ( a ) the 0.1 - 2 kev flux predicted by models for n96 match the best fitting 96bf 0.1 - 2 kev flux , and ( b ) the 0.1 - 10 kev ratio between n96 and m97 models match the observed raw data ratio n96/m97 . in this particular scenario , we could put relatively strong constraints on the covering factors @xmath150 and @xmath160 , but not on @xmath149 , which we then fixed to the value of 0.5 .",
    "we found that @xmath150 and @xmath160 lie in the ranges 0.3 - 0.4 and 0.15 - 0.25 respectively .",
    "figure 4 and 5 show two models for the n96 and m97 spectra of ngc  3516 ( fig .",
    "4a , b , upper and bottom panels respectively ) , and their ratio ( fig .",
    "5 ) in the energy band 0.1 - 10 kev , for @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the ratio between the raw 0.1 - 10 kev n96 and m97 data is also plotted in figure 5c .",
    "the agreement between the models and the data is quite good .",
    "in particular we note that the 1 kev emission feature present in the data is well reproduced by fe l emission by the hot photoionized components , which was much more visible in 1996 due to the heavy obscuration of the primary x - rays by the `` cold '' absorber .",
    "we then conclude that a highly ionized component is present in the nuclear environment of ngc  3516 , and that its emission is visible only when our view of the primary x - rays is at least partially covered by a large amount of neutral absorber",
    ".    this component could well be present in all seyferts , but has eluded detection so far .",
    "if this component is spherically distributed around the central source , and if the covering factor @xmath150 and column density @xmath163 measured in ngc  3516 are representative of the entire class , then we would expect that absorption k edges due to highly ionized iron should be observed in almost 30 - 40% of all known seyferts .",
    "furthermore , in all heavily obscured sources ( i.e. seyfert 2s , or objects with transient absorption , like ngc  3516 ) , we should detect emission by this hot gas , at energies below 1 - 2 kev .",
    "soft x - ray emission is indeed frequently observed in many bright and well studied seyfert 2s ( turner et al .",
    "1997 , comastri et al .",
    "high resolution spectrometry , like that available with chandra and/or xmm , will test this speculation unambiguously by allowing the detection of narrow emission and/or absorption lines even in objects with a low degree of nuclear obscuration with high accuracy , as already studied in ngc  5548 and ngc  3783 ( kaastra et al .",
    "2000 , kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "following mwa97 , we investigate whether the x - ray absorbers in ngc3516 will produce any associated uv absorption lines .",
    "if the cold absorber is mildly ionized , the maximum degree of ionization would be @xmath164 ; as seen in  4.1.2 , a higher value , with the ionizing continuum shape of ngc  3516 , would imply a drastic drop of opacity of the gas at low x - ray energies .",
    "in such an absorber , the dominant ions would be oi - iii , mgii - iii and cii - iv . for a total column density of a few times @xmath134 @xmath2 , the predicted column densities of mgii and civ are @xmath165 and @xmath166 @xmath2 respectively .",
    "for the warm absorber , the civ column density would be @xmath167 , but mg is too highly ionized to have observable mgii . for the cold absorber ,",
    "the mgii and civ column densities are very large and even for a velocity dispersion parameter ( b ) of 100 km s@xmath3 , the resonance absorption lines would have large equivalent widths ( ew 3 ) .    in the warm phase ,",
    "the civ column density is less than that in the cold absorber .",
    "however , the predicted ew of the civ @xmath168 absorption line would still be detectable ( ew1.0  ,  for b=100 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the absorption line ews would be even larger for larger b. therefore , for reasonable parameters , the x - ray absorbers in ngc  3516 will contribute to the absorption in uv .",
    "how broad the lines would be will again depend upon the b parameter .",
    "the uv observations closest in time to our x - ray observations ( @xmath111 days ) are presented by gea99 ( @xmath169 ) . with the hst fos , intrinsic mgii absorption was not detected .",
    "this constrains the cold x - ray absorber ( if still along the line of sight during the uv observation ) to be almost completely neutral .",
    "gea99 found civ @xmath170 absorption doublets with fwhm 651@xmath17116 km s@xmath3 and 405@xmath1719 km s@xmath3 respectively and ews 2.87@xmath1710.09    and 1.47@xmath1710.04    respectively .",
    "the lines are not resolved with the fos and are likely to be saturated . gea99 quote a civ column density in the range between @xmath172 and @xmath173 @xmath2 , very similar to our predicted value for the warm absorber .",
    "earlier observations with ghrs have resolved the civ absorption line into four distinct components , two of which are from the host galaxy of ngc  3516 .",
    "the two nuclear components have column densities consistent with the gea99 values .",
    "we conclude that the nuclear civ absorption line ( possibly component 1 of crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ) is likely to arise in the warm absorber observed by bepposax . at the least",
    ", the warm absorber makes a substantial contribution to the absorption seen in the uv ( based on civ strength ) .",
    "the hot x - ray absorber is too ionized to contribute to the uv absorption lines , since carbon , oxygen and magnesium are fully ionized .",
    "x - ray and uv observations show that the system of x - ray absorbers in ngc  3516 is clearly complex and highly structured with multiple ionization stages just as in the uv absorption lines ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "this complexity is enhanced by variability on many different time scales , from days to years .",
    "it is possible that on the very short time scales of a day , the variability of absorption is governed by the photoionization - recombination timescales , while on the longer time scales from months to years the dynamical time may play the dominant role , either via bulk - motion or adiabatic expansion .",
    "it is conceivable that the different ionization stages trace different phases in the evolution of an absorber .",
    "a neutral absorber may expand as it outflows , becomes a warm absorber and eventually becomes hot and later completely transparent in the x - rays , or the `` components '' may be part of a quasi - static structure in an outflowing wind ( elvis 2000 , murray & chiang 1995 ) . again",
    "high resolution chandra and xmm observations of this source will be crucial to disentangle the many x - ray components , and clearly establish ( or reject ) a link with the uv components .",
    "we presented two bepposax observations of ngc  3516 , performed in 1996 november , and 1997 march .      *",
    "the source underwent strong spectral variability between the two bepposax observations , taken 4 months apart , due entirely to the drastically different degree of obscuration of the central source . during the first observation",
    "the nuclear x - ray continuum was absorbed by an equivalent column of cold hydrogen of @xmath175 , while in 1997 november the absorption was fully compatible with that from our galaxy .",
    "this is the first time that such a change in the degree of obscuration of a seyfert 1 has been clearly observed .",

    "<S> in this paper we present the analysis of two broad band ( 0.1 - 150 kev ) bepposax observations of the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc  3516 . </S>",
    "<S> the two observations were taken 4 months apart , on 1996 november 8 and 1997 march 12 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we report a dramatic change in the degree of obscuration of the central source between the two observations , and propose , as possible explanations , transient absorption by either a stationary - state cloud of cold gas crossing the line of sight , or a varying - state , initially neutral and dense amount of expanding gas with decreasing density and therefore decreasing opacity .    </S>",
    "<S> we also report the detection of a second highly ionized absorber / emitter , which causes deep fexvii - xxii k edges at @xmath0 kev to appear in both bepposax spectra of ngc  3516 , and possibly produces the soft x - ray continuum emission and the 1 kev blend of fe l recombination lines detected during the epoch of heavy nuclear obscuration . </S>"
