    "so far several dozens of clusters have been observed to have radio relics with a variety of morphologies and most of them are considered to be associated with cluster merger activities ( see for reviews , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for instance , double radio relics , such as the ones in zwcl0008.8 + 5215 , are thought to reveal the bow shocks induced by a binary major merger @xcite . on the other hand , recently it was shown that shocks induced by the infall of the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) along adjacent filaments into the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) can efficiently accelerate cr electrons , and so they could be responsible for some radio relics in the cluster outskirts ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the radio relic 1253 + 275 in coma cluster observed in both radio @xcite and x - ray @xcite provides an example of such infall shocks .",
    "the so - called sausage relic in ciza j2242.8 + 5301 ( @xmath7 ) contains a thin arc - like structure of @xmath8 kpc width and @xmath9  mpc length , which could be represented by a portion of spherical shell with radius @xmath5 mpc @xcite .",
    "unique features of this giant radio relic include the nearly uniform surface brightness along the length of the relic and the strong polarization of up to @xmath10 with magnetic field vectors aligned with the relic @xcite .",
    "a temperature jump across the relic that corresponds to a @xmath11 shock has been detected in x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "this was smaller than @xmath12 estimated from the above radio observation .",

    "considering that the characteristic time - scale of cluster dynamics including mergers is @xmath14 gyr , typical cluster shocks are expected to last for about the same period . yet , the number of observed radio relics , which is thought to trace such shocks , is still limited .",
    "so it is plausible to conjecture that cluster shocks may ` turn on ' to emit synchrotron radiation only for a fraction of their lifetime .",
    "one feasible scenario is that a cluster shock lights up in radio when it sweeps up a fossil cloud , a magnetized icm gas with fossil relativistic electrons left over from either a radio jet from agn or a previous episode of shock / turbulence acceleration ( see the discussions in section 2.5 and figure 1 ) .",
    "pre - exiting seed electrons and/or enhanced magnetic fields are the requisite conditions for possible lighting - up of relic shocks . in particular , the elongated shape with",
    "_ uniform _ surface brightness and high polarization fraction of radio emission in the sausage relic , may be explained , if a mpc - scale thermal gas cloud , containing fossil relativistic electrons and permeated with regular magnetic field of a few to several @xmath15 g , is adopted .",
    "a more detailed description will be given later in section 2.5 .",
    "in this picture , fossil electrons are expected to be re - accelerated for less than cloud - crossing time ( @xmath16 ) , which is much shorter than the cluster dynamical time - scale . in addition , only occasional encounters with fossil clouds combined with the short acceleration duration could alleviate the strong constraints on the dsa theory based on non - detection of @xmath17-ray emission from clusters by fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "a similar idea has been brought up by @xcite , who reported the discovery of a mpc - scale , elongated relic in the bullet cluster 1e 0657 - 55.8 .",
    "they also proposed that the arc - like shape of uniform surface brightness in some radio relics may trace the underlying regions of pre - existing , seed electrons remaining from old radio lobes .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite suggested that radio relics could be explained by revival of fossil radio plasma by compression due to a passage of a shock , rather than dsa . in a follow - up study , @xcite showed using mhd simulations that a cocoon of hot radio plasma swept by a shock turns into a filamentary or toroidal structure . although this scenario remains to be a viable explanation for some radio relics , it may not account for the uniform arc - like morphology of the sausage relic .",
    "it is now well established , through observations of radio halos / relics and faraday rotation measures of background radio sources , that the icm is permeated with @xmath15g - level magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the observed radial profile of magnetic field strength tends to peak at the center with a few @xmath15 g and decrease outward to @xmath18 g in the cluster outskirts @xcite .",
    "a variety of physical processes that could generate and amplify magnetic fields in the icm have been suggested : primordial processes , plasma processes at the recombination epoch , and biermann battery mechanism , combined with turbulence dynamo , in addition to galactic winds and agn jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "given the fact that @xmath19 g fields are required to explain the amplitude and width of the observed radio flux profile of the sausage relic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the presence of a cloud with enhanced magnetic fields of several @xmath15 g might be preferred to the background fields of @xmath20 g in the cluster periphery .",
    "alternatively , @xcite showed that the postshock magnetic fields can be amplified to @xmath21 g level leading to high degrees of polarization , if there exists dynamically significant turbulence in the upstream region of a curved shock . although it is well accepted that magnetic fields can be amplified via various plasma instabilities at collisionless shocks , the dependence on the shock parameters such as the shock sonic and alfvnic mach numbers , and the obliquity of background magnetic fields remains to be further investigated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the acceleration of protons and ensuing magnetic field amplification via resonant and non - resonant streaming instabilities are found to be ineffective at perpendicular shocks @xcite .    in several studies using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , synthetic radio maps of simulated clusters",
    "were constructed by identifying shocks and adopting models for dsa of electrons and magnetic field amplification @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite demonstrated , by generating mock radio maps of simulated cluster samples , that radio emission tends to increase toward the cluster periphery and peak around @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the virial radius ) , mainly because the kinetic energy dissipated at shocks peaks around @xmath24 . as a result",
    ", radio relics are rarely found in the cluster central regions .",
    "re - acceleration of fossil relativistic electrons by cosmological shocks during the large scale structure formation has been explored by @xcite .",
    "the radio emitting shocks in these studies look like segments of spherical shocks , moving from the cluster core region into the periphery .",
    "we presume that they are generated mostly as a consequence of major mergers or energetic infalls of the whim along adjacent filaments .",
    "so it seems necessary to study spherical shocks propagating through the cluster periphery , rather than interpreting the radio spectra by dsa at _ steady planar _",

    "shock with _",

    "we refer @xmath31 as the injection spectral index for a steady planar shock with constant postshock magnetic field .",
    "then , the volume - integrated synchrotron spectrum downstream of the shock also becomes a simple power - law of @xmath32 with the spectral index @xmath33 above the break frequency , @xmath34 , since electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse - compton ( ic ) losses behind the shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite performed time - dependent , dsa simulations of cr electrons for _ steady planar _ shocks with @xmath40 and constant postshock magnetic fields .",
    "several models with thermal leakage injection or pre - existing electrons were considered in order to reproduce the surface brightness and spectral aging profiles of radio relics in ciza j2242.8 + 5301 and zwcl0008.8 + 5215 . adopting the same geometrical structure of radio - emitting volume",
    "as described in section 2.5 , they showed that the synchrotron emission from shock accelerated electrons could explain the observed profiles of the radio flux , @xmath41 , of the sausage relic , and the observed profiles of both @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the relic in zwcl0008.8 + 5215 .",
    "here @xmath43 is the distance behind the projected shock edge in the plane of the sky .     in the case of spherically expanding shocks with varying speeds and/or nonuniform magnetic field profiles , on the other hand , the electron spectrum and the ensuing radio spectrum could deviate from those simple power - law forms , as shown in @xcite .",
    "then even the injection slope should vary with the frequency , @xmath44 . here",
    "we follow the evolution of a spherical shock expanding outward in the cluster outskirts with a decreasing density profile , which may lead to a curvature in both the injected spectrum and the volume - integrated spectrum . moreover ,",
    "if the shock is relatively young or the electron acceleration duration is short ( @xmath45 myr ) , then the break frequency falls in @xmath46 ghz and the volume - integrated spectrum of a radio relic would steepen gradually with the spectral index from @xmath31 to @xmath47 over @xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the case of the sausage relic , @xcite and",
    "@xcite originally reported observations of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which imply a shock of @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite , however , found a spectral steepening of the volume - integrated spectrum at 16 ghz , which would be inconsistent with the dsa model for a steady planar shock .",
    "moreover , @xcite , by performing a spatially - resolved spectral fitting , revised the injection index to a steeper value , @xmath50 .",
    "then , the corresponding shock mach number is reduced to @xmath51 .",
    "they also suggested that the spectral age , calculated under the assumption of freely - aging electrons downstream of a steady planar shock , might not be compatible with the shock speed estimated from x - ray and radio observations .",
    "also @xcite reported that for the relic in a2256 , the volume - integrated index steepens from @xmath52 for @xmath53 mhz to @xmath54 for @xmath55 ghz , which was interpreted as a broken power - law .",
    "discoveries of radio relic shocks with @xmath56 in recent years have brought up the need for more accurate understanding of injections of protons and electrons at weak collisionless shocks , especially at high plasma beta ( @xmath57 ) icm plasmas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here @xmath58 is the ratio of the gas to magnetic field pressure .",
    "injection of electrons into the fermi 1st - order process has been one of long - standing problems in the dsa theory for astrophysical shocks , because it involves complex plasma kinetic processes that can be studied only through full particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is thought that electrons must be pre - accelerated from their thermal momentum to several times the postshock thermal proton momentum to take part in the dsa process , and electron injection is much less efficient than proton injection due to smaller rigidity of electrons .",
    "several recent studies using pic simulations have shown that some of incoming protons and electrons gain energies via shock drift acceleration ( sda ) while drifting along the shock surface , and then the particles are reflected toward the upstream region .",
    "those reflected particles can be scattered back to the shock by plasma waves excited in the foreshock region , and then undergo multiple cycles of sda , resulting in power - law suprathermal populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". such ` self pre - acceleration ' of thermal electrons in the foreshock region could be sufficient enough even at weak shocks in high beta icm plasmas to explain the observed flux level of radio relics . in these pic simulations , however , subsequent acceleration of suprathermal electrons into full dsa regime has not been explored yet , because extreme computational resources are required to follow the simulations for a large dynamic range of particle energy .",
    "the main reasons that we implement the fossil electron distribution , instead of the shock injection only case , are ( 1 ) the relative scarcity of radio relics compared to the abundance of shocks expected to form in the icm , ( 2 ) the peculiar uniformity of the surface brightness of the sausage relic , and ( 3 ) curved integrated spectra often found in some radio relics , implying the acceleration duration @xmath45  myr , much shorter than the cluster dynamical time .     in this paper , we consider a dsa model for radio relics ; a spherical shock moves into a magnetized gas cloud containing fossil relativistic electrons , while propagating through a density gradient in the cluster outskirts . specifically , we perform time - dependent dsa simulations for several spherical shock models with the parameters relevant for the sausage relic .",
    "we then calculate the surface brightness profile , @xmath59 , and the volume - integrated radio spectrum , @xmath60 , by adopting a specific geometrical structure of shock surface , and compare them with the observational data of the sausage relic .    in section 2 , the dsa simulations and the model parameters are described . the comparison of our results with observations is discussed in section 3 .",
    "a brief summary is given in section 4 .",
    "we follow the evolution of the cr electron population by solving the following diffusion - convection equation in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spherical geometry : @xmath61 + p { \\partial \\over { \\partial y } } \\left ( { b\\over p^2 } g_e \\right ) , \\label{diffcon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the pitch - angle - averaged phase space distribution function of electrons , @xmath63 is the flow velocity and @xmath64 with the electron mass @xmath65 and the speed of light @xmath66 @xcite .",

    "the structure and evolution of @xmath63 are fed into equation ( [ diffcon ] ) , while the gas pressure , @xmath75 , is used in modeling the postshock magnetic field profile ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "we do not consider the acceleration of cr protons in this study , since the synchrotron emission from cr electrons is our main interest and the dynamical feedback from the cr proton pressure can be ignored at weak shocks ( @xmath76 ) in the test - particle regime @xcite . in order to optimize the shock tracking of the crash code , a comoving frame that expands with the instantaneous shock speed is adopted .",

    "although the icm temperature is known to decrease slightly in the cluster outskirt , it is assumed to be isothermal , since the shock typically travels only @xmath98  mpc for the duration of our simulations @xmath45",
    "magnetic fields in the downstream region of the shock are the key ingredient that governs the synchrotron cooling and emission of cr electrons in our models .",
    "we assume that the fossil cloud is magnetized to @xmath15 g level . as discussed in the introduction , observations indicate that the magnetic field strength decreases from @xmath99 in the core region to @xmath100 in the periphery of clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this corresponds to the plasma beta of @xmath57 in typical icms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , it is well established that magnetic fields can be amplified via resonant and non - resonant instabilities induced by cr protons streaming upstream of _ strong _ shocks @xcite . in addition",
    ", magnetic fields can be amplified by turbulent motions behind shocks @xcite .",

    "the magnetic field amplification in both the upstream and downstream of _ weak _ shocks is not yet fully understood , especially in high beta icm plasmas .",
    "so we consider simple models for the postshock magnetic fields .",
    "for the fiducial case , we assume that the magnetic field strength across the shock transition is increased by compression of the two perpendicular components : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the magnetic field strengths immediately upstream and downstream of the shock , respectively , and @xmath112 is the time - varying compression ratio across the shock . for the downstream region ( @xmath113 ) , the magnetic field strength is assumed to scale with the gas pressure : @xmath114^{1/2 } , \\label{bd}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the gas pressure immediately behind the shock .",
    "this assumes that the ratio of the magnetic to thermal energy density is constant downstream of the shock .",
    "since @xmath82 decreases behind the spherical blast wave , @xmath116 also decreases downstream as illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "this fiducial magnetic field model is adopted in most of the models described in table 1 , except * sa2 * and * sa4 * models .",
    "the range of @xmath117 is shown for the acceleration duration of @xmath118 myr in table 1 , reflecting the decrease of shock compression ratio during the period , but the change is small .    in the second ,",

    "this model was adopted in @xcite and also for * sa2 * and * sa4 * models for comparison in this study .",
    "@xcite showed that the postshock synchrotron emission increases downstream away from the shock in the case of a decelerating shock , because the shock is stronger at earlier time .",
    "but such nonlinear signatures become less distinct in the model with decreasing downstream magnetic fields , compared with the model with constant downstream magnetic fields , because the contribution of synchrotron emission from further downstream region becomes weaker .",
    "as described in the introduction , the new picture of particle injection emerged from recent pic simulations is quite different from the ` classical ' thermal leakage injection model commonly employed in previous studies of dsa ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the requirement of @xmath122 for particles to take part in the full fermi 1st - order process , scattering back and forth diffusively across the shock transition zone with thickness , @xmath123 , seems to remain valid @xcite . here",

    "hence , we adopt the traditional phenomenological model in which only particles above the injection momentum , @xmath127 , are allowed to get injected into the cr populations at the lowest momentum boundary @xcite . this can be translated to the electron lorentz factor , @xmath128 . in the case of expanding shocks considered in this study",

    "one peculiar feature of the sausage relic is the _ uniform _ surface brightness along the mpc - scale arc - like shape , which requires a special geometrical distribution of shock - accelerated electrons @xcite .",

    "we suggest a picture where a spherical shock of radius @xmath131 mpc passes through an elongated cloud with width @xmath132  kpc and length @xmath133  mpc , filled with fossil electrons .",

    "moreover , if the acceleration age is @xmath137 , the volume - integrated radio spectrum is expected to steepen gradually over 0.1 - 10  ghz @xcite .",
    "there are several possible origins for such clouds of relativistic electrons in the icms : ( 1 ) old remnants of radio jets from agns , ( 2 ) electron populations that were accelerated by previous shocks and have cooled down below @xmath138 , and ( 3 ) electron populations that were accelerated by turbulence during merger activities .",
    "although an agn jet would have a hollow , cocoon - like shape initially , it may turn into a filled , cylindrical shape through diffusion , turbulent mixing , or contraction of relativistic plasmas , as the electrons cool radiatively . during such evolution",
    "relativistic electrons could be mixed with the icm gas within the cloud .",
    "we assume that the cloud is composed of the thermal gas of @xmath30 , whose properties ( density and temperature ) are the same as the surrounding icm gas , and an additional population of fossil electrons with dynamically insignificant pressure . in that regard ,",
    "our fossil electron cloud is different from hot bubbles considered in previous studies of the interaction of a shock with a hot rarefied bubble ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the other two cases where",
    "electrons were accelerated either by shocks or by turbulence ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is natural to assume that the cloud medium should contain both thermal gas and fossil electrons .",
    "three different spectra for fossil electron populations are considered . in the first fiducial case ( model ) , nonthermal electrons have the momentum around @xmath139 , which corresponds to @xmath140 for the model shock parameters considered here .",

    "<S> in order to understand certain observed features of arc - like giant radio relics such as the rareness , uniform surface brightness , and curved integrated spectra , we explore a diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) model for radio relics in which a spherical shock impinges on a magnetized cloud containing fossil relativistic electrons . toward this end , </S>",
    "<S> we perform dsa simulations of spherical shocks with the parameters relevant for the sausage radio relic in cluster ciza j2242.8 + 5301 , and calculate the ensuing radio synchrotron emission from re - accelerated electrons . </S>",
    "<S> three types of fossil electron populations are considered : a delta - function like population with the shock injection momentum , a power - law distribution , and a power - law with an exponential cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the surface brightness profile of radio - emitting postshock region and the volume - integrated radio spectrum are calculated and compared with observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the observed width of the sausage relic can be explained reasonably well by shocks with speed @xmath0 and sonic mach number @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these shocks produce curved radio spectra that steepen gradually over @xmath2 with break frequency @xmath3 ghz , if the duration of electron acceleration is @xmath4 myr </S>",
    "<S> . however , the abrupt increase of spectral index above @xmath5 ghz observed in the sausage relic seems to indicate that additional physical processes , other than radiative losses , operate for electrons with @xmath6 . </S>"
