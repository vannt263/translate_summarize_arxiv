    "nowadays microresonators ( disk- , ring- , and spherical - shaped ) evoke considerable interest because new possibilities have recently opened up to develop these types of resonators in the optical frequency range and to utilize them as oscillation systems for optical lasers @xcite . when used in lasers ,",
    "such oscillation systems offer a number of serious advantages , among which are low - threshold currents , a high quality of the radiation spectrum ,  etc .",
    "microresonators manufactured as a dielectric disk whose diameter is large as compared to the wave length of the radiation are nothing else but the open quasi - optical dielectric disk resonators which have long been known in the resonator technology for their potential to effectively sustain the electromagnetic ( em ) field inside the resonator volume .",
    "the retention of the field is provided due to the total internal reflection ( tir ) from the resonator side boundaries of waves making up resonance oscillations . as a result ,",
    "em oscillations of whispering gallery ( wg ) type arise .",
    "as far as their excitation is not accompanied by the additional dissipative loss , superhigh quality factors are achieved in the ddrs .",
    "specifically , in laser systems , in spite of ddr s microscopic dimensions ( the disk diameter is normally about a few @xmath0 m large ) , the quality factors can reach the order of @xmath1 and even more @xcite .",
    "the high quality factors of the ddrs , that are often prepared from doped silicon , are generally provided not only due to extremely small loss attainable in this material but also governed by resonator geometry and the perfection of the crystal it is made of . with a certain number of inhomogeneities ( local and/or non - local , random and/or regular ) in the resonator material , the ray picture of em fields in the resonator changes dramatically as against its perfectly homogeneous counterpart .",
    "the inhomogeneities give rise to local violation of tir conditions and in this way result in additional energy loss which is evident in the quality factor drop . from the above",
    "said there arises the problem of studying the effect produced by random inhomogeneities in the ddrs on their spectral characteristics .    in the theoretic analysis of the radiation loss of the ddr",
    "two types of inhomogeneities are normally distinguished . to the first type",
    "the inhomogeneities of volume nature belong , which are related to regular or random spatial variations of the permittivity in the bulk of the material the ddr is made of .",
    "the other class of inhomogeneities includes the so called `` surface '' imperfections normally related to the deviation of the ddr shape from the ideal cylindrical one .",
    "the influence of bulk random inhomogeneities on the resonance spectrum was previously studied by the present authors in the particular case of cavity resonators filled with randomly distributed dielectric particles @xcite .",
    "it was found that the physical mechanism through which inhomogeneities affect resonator spectrum is basically the intermode scattering . in the case of quasi - optical cavity resonator",
    "the peculiar feature of this type of scattering is the selective impact of inhomogeneities on different resonance lines .",
    "the most affected lines appear to be those which are the least separated on the frequency axis , whereas solitary lines are subjected to much lesser influence .",
    "owing to such a selective effect of random inhomogeneities , the originally dense spectrum of the quasi - optical cavity resonator is considerably rarefied .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the investigations were undertaken into the impact of _ surface _ inhomogeneities on spectral properties of open dielectric resonators of cylindrical and spherical shape .",
    "the influence of boundary roughness upon the resonance lines was described by means of the simplified quasi - geometric approach where em oscillations scattering due to edge inhomogeneities is taken into account by incorporating into the wave equation the fictitious polarization currents ( pc ) randomly distributed in space @xcite . in particular , within the framework of the model adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite the electromagnetic fields close to the resonator side surface were considered as being excited by randomly distributed near - surface current sources whose physical parameters were phenomenologically expressed through statistical characteristics of boundary asperities .",
    "it was precisely the radiation produced by these sources that led to the radiation loss of the resonator and , consequently , to the quality factor reduction .",
    "such an essentially phenomenological approach to the description of the effect produced by the roughness of open resonator boundaries on its spectral properties can not be reckoned as satisfactory .",
    "the volume current method suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , which formed the basis for the pc concept , is , to a large extent , rough and approximate . in this method , the radiation loss is most frequently calculated using green function of the helmholtz equation . the particular form of this function is normally chosen proceeding from the prospective solution of wave equation in the far wave zone .",
    "meanwhile , the very notion of the far zone is poorly defined for multiple sources located around the periphery of the quasi - optical ddr we deal with in this particular work .",
    "specifically , when deriving characteristic equations for open ddr eigen - frequencies , one needs to join em field components exactly at the boundaries of the system under consideration . at this point",
    "a significant uncertainty can arise because the actual external fields subject to _ local _ joining with the internal ones in the presence of surface roughness can deviate considerably from the fields approximated into the boundary vicinity from large distances , i.e. from the far wave zone .    to correctly determine the em fields near the random - inhomogeneous resonator surface",
    "the theories specially adapted for the description of classic and/or quantum wave scattering by rough interfaces should be applied ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "these theories are generally applicable to the cases where wave scattering by random rough surfaces is in a sense weak .",
    "typically , this implies fluctuations of system boundaries to be relatively small in height and sufficiently smooth , so that the applicability of rayleigh hypothesis @xcite was not violated .",
    "however , for confined systems like the ddr considered in this work the issues pertinent to wave scattering by surface inhomogeneities appear to be much more complicated .",
    "firstly , in practice the inhomogeneities are not always small enough , as well as sufficiently smooth , therefore the conditions for scattering weakness are easily violated . moreover , as the resonance ray trajectories in high-_q _ resonators are periodic , the effect of oscillation scattering caused by the boundary roughness is `` path''-accumulated .",
    "scattering can become strong even though the asperities are small - in - height and smooth .",
    "this makes the applicability of the above - mentioned theories of rough - surface scattering in the case of high - quality resonators highly questionable .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the novel transport theory was developed for waveguide - shaped systems with random rough boundaries . in the framework of this theory",
    "it was revealed that the wave scattering resulting from fluctuations of inter - media surfaces can be efficiently described in terms of two physical mechanisms , namely , the _ amplitude _ and the _ gradient _ ones . for the first mechanism it is just the mean - square height of the asperities that serves as a main guiding parameter ,",
    "whereas for the second one the mean slope of the asperities or , in other words , their sharpness , plays the decisive role . both of these mechanisms contribute additively to the scattering amplitude , but partial probabilities pertaining to them may differ essentially . it was shown in @xcite that , in most cases , the role of the gradient scattering appears to be prevalent .",
    "yet there have been no experimental confirmations of this fact in the literature so far .",
    "apart from peculiar problems associated with surface nature of scattering in edge - disordered resonators , some more questions arise which need to be resolved when studying the spectra of ddrs subject to surface inhomogeneities . among these questions ,",
    "particularly , are those related to the vector nature of fields which are excited in these essentially non - integrable systems .",
    "it is known that even for ideal cylindrical ddrs the electrical- and magnetic - type oscillations can not be separated in the strict sense .",
    "they always remain to the certain extent intermixed @xcite .",
    "this fact renders theoretic analysis of such systems spectra rather sophisticated .",
    "spectral properties of ddrs without random inhomogeneities were examined in a number of theoretical papers ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . yet , in deriving characteristic equations some inexact _ a priori _ assumptions where used , which still require both theoretical grounding and experimental corroboration .    in our present study ,",
    "one of the goals is to investigate theoretically the physical mechanisms responsible for widening resonance lines of dielectric microresonators with random surface inhomogeneities . in view of such systems being non - integrable ,",
    "it is necessary to elaborate an appropriate theoretical model allowing for sufficiently accurate determination of both the frequency spectrum and the quality factors of resonance lines .",
    "yet another goal of this study is to corroborate experimentally which of the physical mechanisms does play a dominant role in the scattering of em oscillations excited in microresonators with random rough side boundaries .    from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "the spectrum analysis in our study is carried out in terms of scalar potentials , specifically , electrical and magnetic hertz functions  @xcite .",
    "we formulate the conditions wherein these potentials make independent contributions to em fields in the resonator , which is equivalent to decoupling the oscillations of te and tm polarization .",
    "the helmholtz equation for hertz potentials in an irregular - shaped open resonator is equivalent to schrdinger equation for electrons moving in the piecewise continuous space subject to random potential . owing to this one can extend the results obtained in the present study to quantum systems as well , in particular , to open quantum dots having random rough boundaries .",
    "to solve wave equations in the rough - bounded resonator , the eigen - mode separation method is used , previously developed with reference to waveguide - like systems subject to arbitrary static potential @xcite ) . using this method , the originally posed statistical problem of determining the fields in three - dimensional ddr with complex , randomly rough , side boundary",
    "is rigorously reduced to the set of one - dimensional dynamic equations that contain some _ effective _ random potentials .",
    "we show that under the conditions where gradient scattering mechanism is dominant , the boundary roughness effect on the resonator spectrum can be described through certain renormalization of mode wave numbers and azimuth indices of the bessel functions in the characteristic equation .",
    "the values of renormalized wave numbers and mode indices decrease as the asperities get sharpened , which is consistent with a decrease in the resonator _ q_-factor .",
    "we are thus led to the conclusion that the observed reduction of resonant line quality factors results not from the extra dissipative loss but rather from em field intermode rayleigh scattering induced by random surface inhomogeneities .",
    "the imperfection of the resonator shape results in the local violation of the tir conditions .",
    "this leads to additional radiation loss of em energy and , hence , to a decrease in the level of localization of em fields inside the resonator .",
    "since characteristic dimensions of surface inhomogeneities in actual microresonators are always quite small ( of the order of nanometers ) , to verify our theoretical findings experimentally we have decided upon the method of simulation with macroscopic devices . as a model system",
    "we have employed a millimeter wave quasi - optical resonator made of a circular teflon disk . wg oscillations of te and tm types were excited in the disk using a special waveguide antenna .",
    "the inhomogeneities of the resonator side boundary were made in the form of teflon bracket - bars randomly attached to the outside cylindrical surface .",
    "our experimental results have demonstrated excellent qualitative agreement with the developed theory as regards spectral lines widening caused by the resonator side boundary roughness .",
    "furthermore , the relatively simple model of the ddr field distribution , which was adopted in our study , enabled us to calculate both the _ q_-factors and the frequencies of the resonance lines with quite satisfactory accuracy .",
    "the calculations appeared to be in fair conformity with our experimental data .",
    "consider an open disk resonator as a finite - height cylinder made of the dielectric material with permittivity  @xmath2 .",
    "plain - parallel end boundaries of the cylinder traverse the central axis ( @xmath3 ) at points @xmath4 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , the side boundary ( @xmath5 ) is formed by the generatrix passing parallel to @xmath3-axis along closed contour @xmath6    [ .9 ] and @xmath7 point out the local normal directions to the rough ( @xmath5 ) and to the smoothed resonator side surface , respectively .",

    "the angle brackets in eq .   denote statistical averaging over the ensemble of realizations of random function @xmath11 . in what follows , for the estimation purposes , along with angle parameter @xmath17 we will use another correlation parameter , viz . , arc correlation length @xmath18 .",
    "both the random function @xmath11 and the regular @xmath15 will be thought of as periodic with period  @xmath19 .",
    "it is well known that in general the em field of an open dielectric resonator can be given as a superposition of oscillations of electric and magnetic types ( tm and te polarized , respectively ) @xcite .",
    "the vector fields of both of these types can be expressed in terms of scalar potentials , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( the so - called electric and magnetic debye potentials ) , which meet the same helmholtz equation but are subject to different joining conditions at the resonator boundaries . in arbitrarily shaped resonators tm and te oscillations are essentially intermixed , being strictly decoupled only in the case of sufficiently symmetric systems such as , e.g. , an infinite dielectric cylinder @xcite or a dielectric sphere @xcite .",
    "below it will be shown that tm and te oscillations can also be decoupled ( with high accuracy , though approximately ) in the case of the cylindrical ddr of arbitrary thickness .",
    "this fact opens an opportunity to extend the conclusions of the present work to electronic microresonance systems , e.g. , partially open quantum dots .    in studying oscillations in the ddr with randomly rough side boundaries we first reduce the problem of wave scattering at the boundary to the problem of scattering in the bulk of the resonator of ideal circular form .",

    "moreover , inequality is fulfilled within only limited , i.e. , long - wavelength , part of the resonator bandwidth .",
    "if , at least , one of the conditions is violated , the inter - mode scattering fails to be classified as a weak one in the sense that the norm of scattering operator @xmath84 in the potential becomes large as against the unity .",

    "clearly , such doubling implies that in strong surface scattering the amplitude of the excited oscillations is twice as small as the one in the weak scattering limit .",

    "at the same time , it was necessary to keep the level of the coupling sufficient for spectral lines to be traceable . the pattern of whispering gallery em fields in the ddr in known to be very sensitive to the frequency variation .",
    "therefore the resonator - to - waveguide coupling is different for each of the modes . based upon this , we established the optimal coupling for each of the spectral lines separately while carrying out the measurements in a wide frequency range .",
    "spectral measurements with the model resonator were made in the on - pass regime using millimeter waveband standing - wave ratio meter .",

    "[ fig3 ] one can observe the nearly equidistant character of the spectrum ( the frequency interval @xmath131  ghz ) , which is typical for open resonators with wg - type oscillations @xcite , as well as the exponential dependence on the mode index  @xmath54 of the calculated and the measured @xmath130-factors .    our calculations suggested , and that was experimentally confirmed , that for tm oscillations the resonator quality factor is significantly larger than that for te oscillations , both of them being taken with the same azimuth index .",
    "this suggests that in the case of tm oscillations the ddr has the property to more efficiently retain electromagnetic field in its volume than the resonator with te oscillations does .",
    "we have thus established that both the theoretical model of the resonator we have chosen for our calculations and the characteristic equations obtained thereupon have found impressive experimental confirmations .",
    "according to the findings of our theory , the main physical mechanism for em field scattering by random inhomogeneities of the resonator side boundaries is the gradient mechanism .",

    "with the statistical nature of our measurements ( the averaging is done over a large number of realizations of the bracket - bar set ) , the agreement between theoretical and experimental results appears to be quite satisfactory .",
    "this suggests that , since both in our theory and in the numerical calculations based upon it the slope scattering mechanism alone is taken into account , the qualitative agreement between theory and experiment unambiguously corroborates the dominant role of this particular type of wave - surface scattering .    as is also seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the influence of surface inhomogeneities on the ddr spectrum differs significantly for te- and tm - type oscillations .",

    "the @xmath130-factor of te oscillations is noticeably smaller than that of tm oscillations .",

    "it is shown that the azimuth modes of the resonator oscillations can be rigorously separated at whatever level of surface inhomogeneities .",
    "this allowed us to obtain the asymptotically exact dispersion equations which are valid over a wide range of the roughness parameters .",
    "the only requirement imposed on the inhomogeneities and effectively utilized in the calculations was that their mean - square height be small as compared with the unperturbed ( i.e. , non - rough ) disk resonator radius .",
    "in deriving dispersion relations , we have shown that electromagnetic wave scattering resulting from the boundary roughness can be described in terms of two fundamentally different physical mechanisms , specifically , the amplitude ( the height ) scattering mechanism and the gradient ( the slope ) mechanism . for the first of them , the ratio of the mean height of the asperities to the oscillation wavelength ( the rayleigh parameter ) acts as the main guiding parameter whereas for the gradient mechanism the mean slope of the asperities relative to the unperturbed resonator boundary plays the same role .",
    "our estimations have revealed that it is exactly the gradient scattering that is of primary importance for the formation of rough resonator spectrum .",
    "the effect of this type of scattering can be described through the approximate dispersion equation that differs from the analogous equation for the ideally circular ddr by the gradient renormalization of the basic wave parameters , i.e , , the mode wave numbers and the azimuth index .    our theory aimed at describing the influence of random surface inhomogeneities on microresonator spectral properties analytically is actually of model nature .",
    "the point is that it does not incorporate the electromagnetic fields radiated from the resonator into external angle sectors .",
    "to neglect these fields theoretically is quite a challenge .",
