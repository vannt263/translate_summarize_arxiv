    "wolfenstein effect ( msw ) @xcite and has recently been observed by the super - kamiokande collaboration as an asymmetry in the oscillation rate between zenith and nadir neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this effect is based on the fact , that the components of ` ordinary ' matter , i.e. , electrons , protons , and neutrons , interact with electron neutrinos via charged as well as neutral currents .",
    "muon and tau neutrinos , on the other hand , can not interact with the electrons , thus participate in the neutral current processes only .",
    "this results in an asymmetry in the forward scattering amplitude of different neutrino flavours , effectively changing the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "therefore regular matter distinguishes between electron and other neutrino flavours .",
    "weak interactions are not the only factors that may affect neutrino propagation and oscillations . despite being electrically neutral , zeutrinos , according to the standard model , should exhibit electromagnetic properties . in the second order 1-loop process",
    "@xmath1 neutrino magnetic moment has been estimated by fuijkawa and shrock to be @xmath2 @xcite . for @xmath3",
    "its value reads @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the bohr magneton @xcite .",
    "another estimations , e.g. by kayser @xcite , provide qualitatively similar results @xmath6 .",
    "this value can be larger in various scenarios of physics beyond the standard model @xcite and for certain ranges of non - standard parameters it can reach the experimental limit of roughly @xmath7 @xcite . due to the cpt theorem majorana neutrinos can have only transition ( in the flavour basis ) magnetic moments , while dirac neutrinos can have also diagonal magnetic moments .",
    "it is important to note that the neutrino - photon effective interaction vertex may be constructed in such a way , that it violates the lepton number by two units .",
    "this can be realized if one adds right - handed currents to the standard model , in the @xmath8-parity violating supersymmetric models and others .",
    "in such a situation the transition magnetic moments change neutrinos into antineutrinos of different flavour , while the diagonal magnetic moments change neutrinos into antineutrinos of the same flavour .",
    "it has also been pointed out @xcite that an external non - uniform magnetic field acts differently on neutrinos and antineutrinos , which is due to different helicities of these particles .",
    "this observation has been used to show that under special conditions pontecorvo oscillations @xcite @xmath9 are possible @xcite .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) is a  hypothetical second order process in which some lepton number violating non - standard mechanism accounts for the neutrinos not being released .",
    "this process is of the most importance because , if observed , will qualify neutrinos as majorana particles , which is the contents of the famous schechter ",
    "valle black - box theorem @xcite . to be more exact , as shown in @xcite , the black - box theorem states , that the @xmath0 decay implies a majorana - like contribution to the neutrino mass matrix , but does not exclude other contributions , also dirac - like , which in principle could be even dominant",
    "nevertheless , for a pure dirac neutrino this decay is strictly forbidden .",
    "in this paper we assume neutrinos to be majorana particles .",
    "the simplest and most often discussed mechanism of the @xmath0 decay is the so - called mass mechanism , in which left - handed majorana neutrinos of non - zero mass are produced in the beta vertex as a negative - helicity state with a small positive - helicity admixture .",
    "this positive - helicity admixture is responsible for the possibility of the neutrino being absorbed in the second beta vertex .",
    "of course the intermediate electron neutrino propagates between the beta vertices as a superposition of three mass eigenstates and therefore the inverse half - life of the decay depends on the so - called effective neutrino mass @xmath10 . assuming the exchange of light neutrino and the same chirality in both beta vertices , the neutrino part of the process is described by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the neutrino momentum , @xmath13 are the elements of the first row of the neutrino mixing matrix , and we have used the approximation of small , comparing to @xmath12 , neutrino mass .",
    "the factor @xmath14 is then absorbed by the nuclear matrix element as a part of the energy denominator .",
    "other mechanisms involve different intermediate particles , like the pions , supersymmetric particles , the majoron , and others . in this paper",
    "we describe another mechanism of the neutrinoless double beta decay based on the two - step pontecorvo oscillations .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this mechanism has a resonant - like behaviour and its application to the solution of the solar neutrino puzzle has been discussed . in @xcite",
    "the very same mechanism has been discussed in the context of the @xmath0 decay for a simplified two - neutrino case .",
    "this paper presents the realistic three - neutrino case together with a numerical analysis to show , that the new mechanism may , under proper conditions , significantly shorten the half - life of the decay in the resonance region .",
    "our goal is to describe the nuclear process of the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "we start therefore with the discussion of the neutrino behaviour in the nuclear matter .",
    "neutrino interactions and oscillations inside the nucleus are omitted in the standard approach to the @xmath0 decay @xcite , as it is argued that neutrinos travel a very short distance between the nucleons . despite this fact , the process of flavour oscillations is vital for the proposed here mechanism .",
    "neutrinos travelling through matter undergo a phase shift due to their interactions with electrons , neutrons and protons via neutral and charged weak currents .",
    "a recent discussion of this problem @xcite takes into account also a specific 4-fermion interaction of neutrinos and quarks , but we will not consider this possibility here .    in the most typical case of the msw effect , matter is electrically neutral and contains neutrons and an equal amount of electrons and protons .",
    "the charged current standard model reactions occur between charged leptons and the corresponding neutrinos , so typically electrons and electron neutrinos .",
    "since electrons are absent in the nuclear medium , this interaction is not present inside the nucleus .",
    "the neutral current contributions coming from the electrons and protons have the same magnitudes but different signs due to the opposite electric charges of these particles , resulting in mutual cancelation . in the case of nuclear matter , however , there are no electrons and the proton contribution will not be canceled .",
    "we closely follow the textbook approach presented in @xcite . writing the hamiltonian of neutrinos in vacuum in the mass basis @xmath15 @xmath16 and using the relation for light relativistic particles @xmath17 we get @xmath18 where the symbol @xmath19 represents the diagonal matrix and @xmath20 is the value of the neutrino momentum .",
    "the neutrino mass eigenstates evolve in time according to the schrdinger - like equation @xmath21    the transformation to the flavour basis @xmath22 is defined by the unitary pontecorvo ",
    "sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xmath23 as @xmath24    \\nonumber \\\\    & = & p + \\frac{1}{2p } { \\cal m}^2 ,    \\label{eq : uhu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the square of the neutrino mass matrix in the flavour basis .",
    "the energy levels of the flavour states are corrected in the nuclear matter by their possible interactions via the neutral currents with neutrons and protons @xcite , @xmath26 @xmath27 being the third component of the weak isospin , and @xmath28 is the electric charge .",
    "explicitly the neutron and proton contributions read @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fermi constant , @xmath31 is the weinberg mixing angle , and @xmath32 are the neutron and proton number densities .",
    "we recall that due to the absence of electrons inside the nucleus , the charged - current contribution to the energy of electron neutrino is zero",
    ". therefore all flavour eigenstates are affected by the presence of nuclear matter in the same way and the contribution in this specific case takes the form of a constant shift of the neutrino energy levels . as the neutrino oscillations are sensitive to the differences of masses squared , this will not affect the oscillation rate .",
    "as it was already mentioned in the introduction neutrinos , even within the standard model , possess a non - zero magnetic moment generated in second - order processes . in the case of majorana neutrinos this gives a non - zero probability of the transition between a predominantly left - handed neutrino @xmath33\\nu$ ] and its right - handed counterpart @xmath34 of different flavour , which is triggered by the effective interaction with an external photon .",
    "the main mechanism leading to the @xmath0 decay is based on the conversion between different helicities of an electron neutrino .",
    "so , if one combines the interaction via the magnetic moment with the flavour oscillations , one gets two possible chains which will satisfy the required conditions @xmath35 : @xmath36 both of these chains lead to the @xmath0 decay , but their amplitudes cancel each other exactly .",
    "it is due to the fact , that the main part of the amplitudes are the propagators of @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in normal circumstances these particles",
    "have the same masses , so the propagators are equal , but from the antisymmetricity of the magnetic moment , @xmath39 , follow opposite signs of the final amplitudes and their cancelation .",
    "we have assumed , however , that there is an external magnetic field with which neutrinos interact , and behaviour of majorana neutrinos in these conditions must be examined .    in the standard model neutrinos",
    "are massless , which implies that definite helicity is assigned to a chiral state , so that the left - handed neutrino has negative helicity , while the right - handed antineutrino has positive helicity .",
    "such an assignement is in agreement with experiments , which forces us to define the antineutrino as the cp - conjugate of the neutrino .",
    "massive left - handed neutrinos , on the other hand , are a mixture of negative and positive helicity states , where the latter admixture is proportional to the term @xmath40 , thus being heavily suppressed for relativistic neutrinos .",
    "therefore for practical reasons massive neutrinos can be treated as being predominantly in the negative helicity state and massive antineutrinos being predominantly in the positive helicity state .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field @xmath41 has a two - fold effect .",
    "firstly , transitions between neutrino states of different helicities are possible via the neutrino magnetic moment . for majorana neutrinos",
    "the magnetic moment is antisymmetric @xmath42 , @xmath43 , i.e. , only transitions of the form @xmath44 are possible . the strength of this interaction has the form @xmath45 .",
    "the second effect is , that if the magnetic field changes along the neutrino path , the neutrinos of different helicities will obtain different corrections to their effective masses .",
    "this follows from the fact that a frame of reference with spin @xmath46 , which is rotating with the angular velocity @xmath47 , gains energy @xmath48 .",
    "since left - handed neutrinos ( @xmath49 ) and their right - handed counterparts ( @xmath50 ) have opposite helicities , the degeneracy of their energy levels is lifted in the presence of an external rotating magnetic field .",
    "the component of the rotating field that is parallel to @xmath46 does not contribute to this effect , so we denote by @xmath51 the magnitude of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field , with the angle @xmath52 indicating the direction of @xmath53 , and switch to a  reference frame which rotates with the field .",
    "we can write the magnetic field angular velocity as @xmath54 .",
    "the correction to the energy coming from the field rotation is @xmath55 for left - handed particles and @xmath56 for right - handed particles , and the immediate consequence of the lifting of the degeneracy of majorana neutrinos of different helicities masses is , that the amplitudes of the chains ( [ eq : chain1])-([eq : chain2 ] ) do not cancel each other .      in the two neutrinos case @xcite",
    "the results can be presented in an concise analytical form and they exhibit all the key features of the realistic three - flavour case , which will be described in the next section . choosing the basis @xmath57 the mixing matrix depends on one vacuum mixing angle @xmath58 only : @xmath59 we neglect here , for simplicity , the possible cp - violating phases , but will discuss them in the three - neutrino case .",
    "the hamiltonian , diagonal in the mass basis , becomes non - diagonal in the flavour basis .",
    "taking into account matter and magnetic field corrections it takes the block form : @xmath60_2 \\\\         -[b\\mu]_2 & h_\\nu - \\frac{\\dot\\phi}{2 }      \\end{array } \\right ) , \\label{eq : h-2nu}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 with @xmath62 @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 being given by ( [ eq : vn ] ) and ( [ eq : vp ] ) , and @xmath66_2 = b \\left(\\begin{array}{cc }         0 & \\mu_{e\\mu } \\\\ -\\mu_{e\\mu } & 0       \\end{array } \\right ) .\\ ] ] here @xmath67 is the antisymmetric majorana neutrino transition magnetic moment",

    "the full discussion of this problem , which involves the choice of an appropriate nuclear model to describe the hadronic part , is beyond the scope of the present manuscript . in what follows",

    ", we have to make some approximations .",
    "firstly , we neglect the 4-momenta of the electrons and the photon .",
    "the product of two propagators of neutrinos with a common 4-momentum @xmath28 reduces then to @xmath99 because there are left chiral projectors @xmath100 in each beta vertex , as the @xmath101 bosons couple to the left - handed fields only , and @xmath102 . at this point one",

    "we notice , however , that for masses significantly smaller than the 4-momentum the expression ( [ eq : props ] ) is proportional to @xmath106 , which is a small number , while it explodes for massess @xmath107 .",
    "this means that in the region close to the pole , one may retain the dominant terms only and write the approximate expression for @xmath95 in the form : @xmath108 where @xmath109 number the mass eigenstates and @xmath110 denote the flavour eigenstates .",
    "we notice , that since the factor @xmath111 enters the hamiltonian directly , it has the unit of mass and therefore @xmath112 has the unit 1/ev and it can not be directly compared with the effective neutrino mass @xmath113 .",

    "what is more , by having the possibility of changing this term , we can arrive at the resonance @xmath114 or @xmath115 boosting the @xmath95 significantly .",

    "( [ eq : u ] ) , appear and the expression ( [ eq : chi ] ) will not be zero even if there is degeneracy among the masses .",

    ", this should take into account the momenta of the electrons and the photon , a proper regularization of the propagators , and integration over the neutrino 4-momentum @xmath28 . finishing this discussion",
    "we would like to stress , that the mass mechanism may be realized spontaneously .",
    "our mechanism , however , requires certain additional conditions , which have been described in this paper , and can be realized in a specific environment only , like in the vicinity of rotating neutron star or magnetar , in which fast changing magnetic fields of the order of @xmath167  t have been observed .",
    "we have developed a description of a new channel of the neutrinoless double beta decay , first proposed in our previous work @xcite . in this scenario",
    "electron neutrino emitted in one beta vertex reacts through its induced magnetic moment with an external non - uniform magnetic field , which results in a helicity - flip and flavour change .",
    "a subsequent oscillation back to the electron flavour allows for an absorption of the resulting particle in the second beta vertex . this process may result in a @xmath0 decay .",
    "an interesting feature of this scenario is that the @xmath95 parameter , which describes the propagating neutrino , depends on the change of the direction of the external magnetic field , which was represented in our discussion by the parameter @xmath71 .",
    "the function @xmath127 has a pole and for certain values of the argument , which is roughly equal to twice the neutrino 4-momentum , becomes large . since the half - life of the discussed decay is proportional to @xmath168 it becomes short in the resonance region .",
    "this opens , at least theoretically , the possibility to induce the @xmath0 decay by tuning the external magnetic field .",
