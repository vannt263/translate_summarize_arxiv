    "among the chemically peculiar stars of the main sequence , the am sub - group shows caii k - line too early for their hydrogen line types , while metallic - lines appear too late , such that the spectral types inferred from the caii k- and metal - lines differ by five or more spectral subclasses . the marginal am stars ( denoted with am : ) are those whose difference between caii k- and metal - lines is less than five subclasses .",
    "the commonly used classification for this class of objects includes three spectral types prefixed with _",
    "k _ , _ h _ , and _ m _ , corresponding to the k - line , hydrogen - lines and metallic lines , respectively .",
    "the typical chemical pattern show underabundances of ca and/or sc and overabundances of the fe - peak elements , y , ba and of rare earths elements @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that the strength of the metal lines is due to the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an a - type star where magnetic field should be weak or absent . in this scenario",
    ", the am stars should rotate slower than about 120 km s@xmath17 to allow radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "most am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 2 and 10 days ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    one important open question in the framework of am stars concerns the presence of pulsations .",
    "for many years it was thought that am stars did not pulsate , since their heii ionization zone should be fully depleted of helium due to atomic diffusion , i.e. radiative levitation and , in particular , gravitational settling , thus preventing the @xmath18-mechanism to excite a @xmath19 scuti type pulsation .",
    "this scenario applies to am stars as they rotate slowly . on the contrary ,",
    "normal a stars are usually rapid rotators and remain mixed because of turbulence induced by meridional circulation ; thus in their interiors the pulsations can be excited by the @xmath18-mechanism @xcite .",
    "this theoretical scenario has been recently questioned by intensive ground - based ( superwasp survey , * ? ? ? * ) and space - based ( _ kepler _ mission , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations which have clearly demonstrated that many am / fm stars do pulsate . before these recent surveys , pulsations were observed only in two am stars , namely hd1097 @xcite and hd13079 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , for example , found that about 169 , 30 and 28 am stars out of a total of 1600 show @xmath19  sct , @xmath20  dor or hybrid pulsations , respectively ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a definition of these classes ) .",
    "these authors found also that the positions in the hertzsprung - russel ( hr ) diagram of am stars pulsating as @xmath19  sct are confined between the red and blue radial fundamental edges , and this result has been also confirmed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "pulsating am stars show oscillations with lower amplitude than normal abundance @xmath19 scuti stars .",
    "there is still not a satisfactory explanation for this amplitude difference .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that starspots could be the origin of rotational - type variability found in a significant fraction of a stars , whereas @xcite proposed that about 2 percent of the a stars exhibit flares .",
    "as to am stars , based on 50-days _ kepler _ time series , @xcite found suspected rotational modulation in a sample of 10 stars .",
    "this result has been very recently confirmed by @xcite , who analyzed a sample of 15 am stars with 4-years of _ kepler _ data plus 14 am stars from the _ k2 _ campaign 0 ( c0 ) field finding that most of these objects show a rotational modulation due to starspots whereas two stars exhibit flares .    in this context , the present paper is a further step in our programme devoted to determine photospheric abundances in am stars that lie in the kepler field of view , by means of high resolution spectra .",
    "three papers have already been published on this topics : @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , in which , for a total of 11 stars , fundamental astrophysical quantities , such as effective temperatures , gravities and metallicities have been derived .",
    "such kind of studies are crucial in order _",
    "i ) _ to put constraints on the processes occurring at the base of the convection zone in non - magnetic stars and _ ii ) _ to try to define the locus on the hr diagram occupied by pulsating am stars .    with these goals in mind , we present a complete analysis of other seven stars previously classified as am stars .",
    "three targets have already been observed by kepler during quarters q0-q17 ( namely , hd180347 , hd181206 , and hd185658 ) , while the other five stars had been proposed for observations in the context of the _ k2 _ phase mission .",
    "however , only hd43509 was actually targeted during _ k2 _ c0 campaign , because this star was the only one that falled on the silicon when the final c0 field center was decided ( see * ? ? ? * for details on the _ kepler _ and _ k2 _ observations for the target stars ) . for our purposes",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy is the best tool principally for two reasons , _",
    "i ) _ the blanketing due to the chemical peculiarities in the atmospheres of am stars alters photometric colors and then fundamental stellar parameters based on them may not be accurate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and _ ii ) _ the abnormal abundances coupled with rotational velocity result in a severe spectral lines blending which makes difficult the separation of the individual lines . both problems could be overcome only by matching synthetic and observed spectra .",
    "spectroscopic observations of our sample of seven stars ( see table  [ tabphotometry ] for the list of targets ) were carried out with the new _ catania astrophysical observatory spectropolarimeter _ ( caos ) which is a fiber fed , high - resolution , cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph @xcite installed recently at the cassegrain focus of the 91 cm telescope of the _ `` m .",
    "g. fracastoro '' _ observing station of the catania astrophysical observatory ( mt . etna , italy ) .",
    "our spectra were obtained in 2014 , between march and november .",
    "exposure times have been tuned in order to obtain for the stars a signal - to - noise ratio of at least 100 in the continuum in the 390800  nm , with a resolution of r = 45000 , as measured from thar and telluric lines .",
    "the reduction of all spectra , which included the subtraction of the bias frame , trimming , correcting for the flat - field and the scattered light , extraction for the orders , and wavelength calibration , was done using the noao / iraf packages . given the importance of balmer lines in our analysis",
    ", we paid much more attention in the normalization of the corresponding spectral orders .",
    "in particular , we divided the spectral order containing h@xmath21 by a pseudo - continuum obtained combining the continua of the previous and subsequent echelle orders , as already outlined by @xcite .",
    "this procedure was not necessary for the h@xmath22 , since spectral coverage of the order is wider than the line itself and it was possible to properly fix the continuum offset .    the iraf package _ rvcorrect _ was used to determine the barycentric velocity correcting the spectra for the earth s motion .",

    "with the unique goal of speeding up the spectroscopic investigation of the target stars , we estimated first guess stellar parameters by comparing the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with selected model atmosphere . to this aim",

    "the first step was to collect the photometric data by means of the @xmath27 package itself .",

    "the second step consisted in estimating the extinction value for each target .",
    "this task was accomplished by adopting the values from @xcite for all the stars with two exceptions : hd43509 and hd185658 for which the @xcite value were too high for stars relatively close to the sun ( i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 mag , respectively ) . in these cases",
    "we first left @xmath27 free to fit also the reddening .",
    "afterwards , we redetermined this value _ a posteriori _ using the effective temperature and gravity estimated spectroscopically to find the expected intrinsic @xmath33 color as tabulated by e.g. @xcite . a simple comparison with the observed @xmath33 provided the adopted reddening value .",
    "the same procedure was applied to the remaining five stars , allowing us to verify the reliability of the reddening values by @xcite adopted for these objects .",
    "the @xmath34 values for each target are reported in coloumn ( 6 ) of table  [ tabphotometry ] .",
    "an additional parameter needed to build the seds is the distance of the star .",
    "as shown in coloumn ( 5 ) of table  [ tabphotometry ] : only three stars possess _ hipparcos _ parallax @xcite , for the remaining ones @xmath27 assigned a reference distance of 10 pc and @xmath24 since we are reproducing the shape of the sed and not the actual luminosities . ] .",
    "the observed seds for all the investigated objects are shown as filled circles in fig .",
    "finally , @xmath27 performed a least - square fit to these seds by adopting the atlas9 kurucz odfnew /nover",
    "models @xcite to obtain a first estimate of effective temperature , gravity and metallicity ( see fig",
    ".  [ sed ] and table  [ tabphotometry ] ) .",
    "note that the uncertainties calculated by the vosa package on these quantities , only take into account for the internal error on sed fitting procedure , resulting underestimated by at least a factor 2 , mainly because of the intrinsic limits of the method when , as in our case , mainly optical and infrared data is available ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for this reason we have doubled the uncertainties on effective temperature , gravity and metallicity as listed in columns ( 8) to ( 10 ) of table  [ tabphotometry ] .",
    "however , we stress again that obtaining precise values for the stellar parameters and the relative uncertainties by means of the sed fitting procedure is not the purpose of the present paper , as we only aim at obtaining quick and approximate starting points for the spectroscopic analysis",
    ".    we also estimated the bolometric correction in the @xmath2-band ( @xmath6 ) for all our targets with the aim to locate the stars in the hr diagram ( see section  [ hr ] ) . to calculate these values , we adopted the models by @xcite where m@xmath35=4.74 mag is assumed .",

    "the approach used in this paper has been succesfully used in other papers devoted to this topics , see for instance @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the procedure used for our targets was to minimize the difference among observed and synthetic spectrum , using as goodness - of - fit parameter the @xmath38 defined as    @xmath39    where n is the total number of points , i@xmath40 and i@xmath41 are the intensities of the observed and computed profiles , respectively , and @xmath42 is the photon noise .",
    "synthetic spectra were generated in three steps : i ) we computed lte atmospheric models using the atlas9 code @xcite ; ii ) the stellar spectra were synthesized using synthe @xcite ; iii ) the spectra were convolved for the instrumental and rotational broadening .",

    "when @xmath45 is greater than 8000  k , balmer lines become sensitive also to @xmath24 . in these cases , we used another independent method to uniquely derive the temperature .",
    "for the hottest stars of our sample , namely : hd50766 , hd52403 , and hd185658 , we refined the temperatures by requiring that abundances obtained from differing ionization stages of iron must agree , in particular we used the fei to feii line ratio as a first iteration , models were computed using solar opacity distribution function ( odf ) table and t@xmath23 and @xmath24 derived in sec .",

    "the simultaneous fitting of these two lines ( as shown in fig .",

    "an important source of uncertainties arised from the difficulties in continuum normalization as it is always challenging for balmer lines in echelle spectra .",
    "we quantified the error introduced by the normalization to be at least 100  k , that we summed in quadrature with the errors obtained by the fitting procedure .",
    "the final results for effective temperatures and their errors are reported in table  [ param ] .",
    "the surface gravities were estimated by three different methods according to the effective temperature of each object ; for stars with t@xmath23 greater than 8000  k ( namely : hd50766 , hd52433 , hd58246 , and hd185658 ) , we derived @xmath24 by fitting the wings of balmer lines . for stars cooler than this value , the wings of the balmer lines loose their sensitivity to gravity , hence we adopted two alternative methods . for hd43509 and hd180347 we exploited the ionization equilibrium fe i / feii ( see fig .  [ logg ] ) , whereas for the fastest rotator of our sample , hd181206 , the iron lines are too shallow and blended with other features .",

    "regarding @xmath47 , we used the values of @xcite , whereas the van der waals damping constant was taken from @xcite ( @xmath48 ) ; the stark damping constant is from @xcite ( @xmath49 ) , and the radiative damping constant is from nist database ( @xmath50 ) . for the sake of clarity , in fig .",
