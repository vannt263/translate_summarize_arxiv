    "this contribution concentrates on the study of feasibility conditions to identify admissible equilibria for weakly reversible mass action law ( mal ) systems . to that purpose ,",
    "a flux - based form of the model equations describing the time evolution of the species concentration has been exploited , in combination with results from the theory of linear compartmental systems to develop a canonical representation of the equilibrium set .",
    "ingredients of such representation include the so - called family of solutions , with the corresponding positivity conditions , and the feasibility functions employed to characterize the set of feasible ( equilibrium ) solutions .",
    "one main result of this contribution is that the introduced feasibility functions are monotonously decreasing on their domain .",
    "this allows us to establish connections with classical results in crnt related to the existence and uniqueness of equilibria within positive stoichiometric compatibility classes .",
    "in particular , we employ monotonicity to identify regions in the set of possible reaction rate coefficients leading to complex balancing , and to conclude uniqueness of equilibria for a class of positive deficiency networks .",
    "it is our hope that the proposed results might support the understanding of the deficiency one theorem from a different point of view , with the possibility of an alternative proof .",
    "a number of examples of different complexity are employed to illustrate the notions presented and their relations .",
    "as the examples show , all components used for the characterization of equilibria , in particular the family of solutions and the feasibility functions , can be computed efficiently in an algorithmic way , even for large kinetic models .",
    "future work will be focused on the constructive application of these functions for the computational search or design of networks with unique equilibria .",

    "<S> feasibility is imposed by a set of constraints , which are linear on a log - transformed space of complexes , and relate to the kernel of a matrix , the columns of which span the stoichiometric subspace . </S>",
    "<S> one particularly interesting representation of these constraints can be expressed in terms of a class of monotonous decreasing functions . </S>",
    "<S> this allows connections to be established with classical results in crnt that relate to the existence and uniqueness of equilibria along positive stoichiometric compatibility classes .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , monotonicity can be employed to identify regions in the set of possible reaction rate coefficients leading to complex balancing , and to conclude uniqueness of equilibria for a class of positive deficiency networks . </S>",
    "<S> the latter result might support constructing an alternative proof of the well - known deficiency one theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the developed notions and results are illustrated through examples .    </S>",
