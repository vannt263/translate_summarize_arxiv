    "the goal of the development of the code was to have a simple and efficient tool for the computation of adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models , emphasizing also the accuracy of the results .",
    "not surprisingly , given the long development period , the simplicity is now less evident .",
    "however , the code offers considerable flexibility in the choice of integration method as well as ability to determine all frequencies of a given model , in a given range of degree and frequency .",
    "the choice of variables describing the equilibrium model and oscillations was to a large extent inspired by @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : eqmodel ] the equilibrium model is defined in terms of a minimal set of dimensionless variables , as well as by mass and radius of the model .",
    "fairly extensive documentation of the code , on which the present paper in part is based , is provided with the distribution packagejcd / adipack.n ] .",
    "@xcite provided an extensive review of adiabatic stellar oscillations , emphasizing applications to helioseismology , and discussed many aspects and tests of the aarhus package , whereas @xcite carried out careful tests and comparisons of results on polytropic models ; this includes extensive tables of frequencies which can be used for comparison with other codes .",
    "the equilibrium model is defined in terms of the following dimensionless variables : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is distance to the centre , @xmath2 is the mass interior to @xmath1 , @xmath3 is the photospheric radius of the model and @xmath4 is its mass ; also , @xmath5 is the gravitational constant , @xmath6 is pressure , @xmath7 is density , and @xmath8 , the derivative being at constant specific entropy .",
    "in addition , the model file defines @xmath4 and @xmath3 , as well as central pressure and density , in dimensional units , and scaled second derivatives of @xmath6 and @xmath7 at the centre ( required from the expansions in the central boundary condition ) ; finally , for models with vanishing surface pressure , assuming a polytropic relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the near - surface region , the polytropic index is specified .",
    "the following relations between the variables defined here and more `` physical '' variables are often useful : @xmath9 we may also express the characteristic frequencies for adiabatic oscillations in terms of these variables . thus if @xmath10 is the buoyancy frequency , @xmath11 is the lamb frequency at degree @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the acoustical cut - off frequency for an isothermal atmosphere , we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the adiabatic sound speed , and @xmath16 is the pressure scale height , @xmath17 being the gravitational acceleration .",
    "finally it may be noted that the squared sound speed is given by @xmath18 these equations also define the dimensionless characteristic frequencies @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as the dimensionless sound speed @xmath22 , which are often useful .      as is well known the displacement vector of nonradial ( spheroidal ) modes",

    "also , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are unit vectors in the @xmath1 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 directions . finally , @xmath33 is time and @xmath34 is the angular frequency of the mode .",

    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc . can be chosen to be real .",
    "the equations of adiabatic stellar oscillations , in the nonradial case , are expressed in terms of the following variables : , @xmath39 results from the earlier use of an unconventional sign convention for @xmath40 ; now , as usual , @xmath40 is defined such that the perturbed poisson equation has the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the eulerian density perturbation . ]",
    "@xmath43 here @xmath40 is the perturbation to the gravitational potential . also , we introduce the dimensionless frequency @xmath44 by @xmath45 corresponding to eqs [ eq : buoy ]  [ eq : cutoff ] . these quantities satisfy the following equations : @xmath46   y_1 + ( a - 1 )   y_2 + \\eta a   y_3 \\ ; , \\\\ \\label{eq : ea.3 } x   { { { \\rm d}}y_3   \\over { { \\rm d}}x } & = & y_3 + y_4 \\ ; , \\\\ \\label{eq : ea.4 } x   { { { \\rm d}}y_4   \\over { { \\rm d}}x } & = & - a u   y_1    - u { v_g    \\over \\eta } y_2 \\\\ & & + [ l ( l + 1 ) + u(a - 2 ) +   u v_g ]   y_3 + 2(1 - u )   y_4 \\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath47 , and the notation is otherwise as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : fivea ] . in the @xcite approximation , where the perturbation to the gravitational potential is neglected ,",
    "the terms in @xmath48 are neglected in eqs  [ eq : ea.1 ] and [ eq : ea.2 ] and eqs  [ eq : ea.3 ] and [ eq : ea.4 ] are not used .",
    "the dependent variables @xmath49 in the nonradial case have been chosen in such a way that for @xmath50 they all vary as @xmath51 for @xmath52 . for large @xmath12 a considerable ( and fundamentally unnecessary ) computational effort",
    "would be needed to represent this variation sufficiently accurately with , e.g. , a finite difference technique , if these variables were to be used in the numerical integration .",
    "instead i introduce a new set of dependent variables by @xmath53 these variables are then @xmath54 in @xmath55 near the centre .",

    "in the most common case involving a complete stellar model @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a suitably small number such that the series expansion around @xmath66 is sufficiently accurate ; however , the code can also deal with envelope models with arbitrary @xmath67 , typically imposing @xmath68 at the bottom of the envelope .",
    "the outermost point is defined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the surface radius , including the atmosphere ; thus , typically , @xmath71 .",
    "the centre of the star , @xmath72 , is obviously a singular point of the equations .",
    "as discussed , e.g. , by @xcite boundary conditions at this point are obtained from a series expansion , in the present code to second significant order . in the general case",
    "this defines two conditions at the innermost non - zero point in the model . for radial oscillations , or nonradial oscillations in the cowling approximation",
    ", one condition is obtained .",
    "the surface in a realistic model is typically defined at a suitable point in the stellar atmosphere , with non - zero pressure and density . here",
    "the simple condition of vanishing lagrangian pressure perturbation is implemented and sometimes used .",
    "however , more commonly a condition between pressure perturbation and displacement is established by matching continuously to the solution in an isothermal atmosphere extending continuously from the uppermost point in the model .",
    "a very similar condition was presented by @xcite . in addition , in the full nonradial case a condition is obtained from the continuous match of @xmath40 and its derivative to the vacuum solution outside the star .    in full polytropic models , or other models with vanishing surface pressure , the surface is also a singular point . in this case",
    "a boundary condition at the outermost non - singular point is obtained from a series expansion , assuming a near - surface polytropic behaviour ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the code also has the option of considering truncated ( e.g. , envelope ) models although at the moment only in the cowling approximation or for radial oscillations . in this case",
    "the innermost boundary condition is typically the vanishing of the radial displacement @xmath73 although other options are available .",
    "the numerical problem can be formulated generally as that of solving @xmath74 with the boundary conditions @xmath75 @xmath76 here the order @xmath77 of the system is 4 for the full nonradial case , and 2 for radial oscillations or nonradial oscillations in the cowling approximation .",
    "this system only allows non - trivial solutions for selected values of @xmath78 which is thus an eigenvalue of the problem .",
    "the programme permits solving these equations with two basically different techniques , each with some variants .",
    "the first is a shooting method , where solutions satisfying the boundary conditions are integrated separately from the inner and outer boundary , and the eigenvalue is found by matching these solutions at a suitable inner fitting point @xmath79 .",
    "the second technique is to solve the equations together with a normalization condition and all boundary conditions using a relaxation technique ; the eigenvalue is then found by requiring continuity of one of the eigenfunctions at an interior matching point .",
    "for simplicity i do not distinguish between @xmath80 and @xmath56 ( cf . section  [ sec : eq ] ) in this section .",
    "it is implicitly understood that the dependent variable ( which is denoted @xmath56 ) is @xmath80 for @xmath57 and @xmath56 for @xmath81 .",
    "the numerical treatment of the transition between @xmath80 and @xmath56 has required a little care in the coding .",
    "it is convenient here to distinguish between @xmath77 = 2 and @xmath77 = 4 . for @xmath77 = 2 the differential eqs  [ eq : e3.1 ]",
    "have a unique ( apart from normalization ) solution @xmath82 satisfying the inner boundary conditions [ eq : e3.2 ] , and a unique solution @xmath83 satisfying the outer boundary conditions [ eq : e3.3 ] .",
    "these are obtained by numerical integration of the equations .",
    "the final solution can then be represented as @xmath84 .",
    "the eigenvalue is obtained by requiring that the solutions agree at a suitable matching point @xmath85 , say .",
    "thus @xmath86 these equations clearly have a non - trivial solution @xmath87 only when their determinant vanishes , i.e. , when @xmath88 equation [ eq : e3.5 ] is therefore the eigenvalue equation .",
    "for @xmath77 = 4 there are two linearly independent solutions satisfying the inner boundary conditions , and two linearly independent solutions satisfying the outer boundary conditions .",
    "the former set @xmath89 is chosen by setting @xmath90 and the latter set @xmath91 is chosen by setting @xmath92 the inner and outer boundary conditions are such that , given @xmath59 and @xmath48 , @xmath60 and @xmath39 may be calculated from them ; thus eqs  [ eq : e3.6 ] and [ eq : e3.7 ] completely specify the solutions , which are obtained by integrating from the inner or outer boundary .",
    "the final solution can then be represented as @xmath93 at the fitting point @xmath79 continuity of the solution requires that @xmath94 this set of equations only has a non - trivial solution if @xmath95 where , e.g. , @xmath96 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "[ eq : e3.9 ] is the eigenvalue equation in this case .",
    "clearly @xmath97 as defined in either eq .",
    "[ eq : e3.5 ] or eq .",
    "[ eq : e3.9 ] is a smooth function of @xmath78 , and the eigenfrequencies are found as the zeros of this function .",
    "this is done in the programme using a standard secant technique .",
    "however , the programme also has the option for scanning through a given interval in @xmath78 to look for changes of sign of @xmath97 , possibly iterating for the eigenfrequency at each change of sign .",
    "thus it is possible to search a given region of the spectrum completely automatically .",
    "the programme allows the use of two different techniques for solving the differential equations .",
    "one is the standard second - order centred difference technique , where the differential equations are replaced by the difference equations @xmath98",
    ", \\quad i = 1 , \\ldots , i \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : e3.11}\\ ] ] here i have introduced a mesh @xmath99 in @xmath55 , where @xmath10 is the total number of mesh points ; @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "these equations allow the solution at @xmath102 to be determined from the solution at @xmath103 .",
    "the second technique was proposed by @xcite ; here on each mesh interval @xmath104 we consider the equations @xmath105 with constant coefficients , where @xmath106 .",
    "these equations may be solved analytically on the mesh intervals , and the complete solution is obtained by continuous matching at the mesh points .",
    "this technique clearly permits the computation of solutions varying arbitrarily rapidly , i.e. , the calculation of modes of arbitrarily high order . on the other hand solving eqs  [ eq : e3.12 ] involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix , and therefore becomes very complex and time consuming for higher - order systems .",
    "thus in practice it has only been implemented for systems of order 2 , i.e. , radial oscillations or nonradial oscillations in the cowling approximation .",
    "if one of the boundary conditions is dropped , the difference equations , with the remaining boundary condition and a normalization condition , constitute a set of linear equations for the @xmath107 which can be solved for any value of @xmath44 ; this set may be solved efficiently by forward elimination and backsubstitution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a procedure very similar to the so - called henyey technique ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* see also christensen - dalsgaard 2007 ) used in stellar modelling .",
    "the eigenvalue is then found by requiring that the remaining boundary condition , which effectively takes the role of @xmath108 , be satisfied .",
    "however , as both boundaries , at least in a complete model , are either singular or very nearly singular , the removal of one of the boundary conditions tends to produce solutions that are somewhat ill - behaved , in particular for modes of high degree .",
    "this in turn is reflected in the behaviour of @xmath97 as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "this problem is avoided in a variant of the relaxation technique where the difference equations are solved separately for @xmath109 and @xmath110 , by introducing a double point @xmath111 in the mesh . the solution is furthermore required to satisfy the boundary conditions [ eq : e3.2 ] and [ eq : e3.3 ] , a suitable normalization condition ( e.g. @xmath112 ) , and continuity of all but one of the variables at @xmath85 , e.g. , @xmath113 ( when @xmath77 = 2 clearly only the first continuity condition is used ) we then set @xmath114 and the eigenvalues are found as the zeros of @xmath97 , regarded as a function of @xmath78 . with this definition",
    ", @xmath97 may have singularities with discontinuous sign changes that are not associated with an eigenvalue , and hence a little care is required in the search for eigenvalues .",
    "however , close to an eigenvalue @xmath97 is generally well - behaved , and the secant iteration may be used without problems .    as implemented here",
    "the shooting technique is considerably faster than the relaxation technique , and so should be used whenever possible ( notice that both techniques may use the difference eqs  [ eq : e3.11 ] and so they are numerically equivalent , in regions of the spectrum where they both work ) . for _ second - order systems _ the shooting technique can probably always be used ; the integrations of the inner and outer solutions should cause no problems , and the matching determinant in eq .",
    "[ eq : e3.5 ] is well - behaved . for _ fourth - order systems _",
    ", however , this needs not be the case . for modes where the perturbation to the gravitational potential has little effect on the solution , the two solutions @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and similarly the two solutions @xmath117 and @xmath118 , are almost linearly dependent , and so the matching determinant nearly vanishes for any value of @xmath78 .",
    "this is therefore the situation where the relaxation technique may be used with advantage .",
    "this applies , in particular , to the calculation of modes of moderate and high degree which are essential to helioseismology .      to make full use of the increasingly accurate observed frequencies the computed frequencies should clearly at the very least match the observational accuracy , for a given model . only in this way",
    "do the frequencies provide a faithful representation of the properties of the model , in comparisons with the observations",
    ". however , since the numerical errors in the computed frequencies are typically highly systematic , they may affect the asteroseismic inferences even if they are smaller than the random errors in the observations , and hence more stringent requirements should be imposed on the computations .",
    "also , the fact that solar - like oscillations , and several other types of asteroseismically interesting modes , tend to be of high radial order complicates reaching the required precision .",
    "the numerical techniques discussed so far are generally of second order .",
    "this yields insufficient precision in the evaluation of the eigenfrequencies , unless a very dense mesh is used in the computation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the code may apply two techniques to improve the precision .",
    "one technique ( cf .",
    "* ) uses the fact that the frequency approximately satisfies a variational principle @xcite .",
    "the variational expression may formally be written as @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are integrals over the equilibrium model depending on the eigenfunction , here represented by @xmath122 .",
    "the variational property implies that any error @xmath123 in @xmath122 induces an error in @xmath124 that is @xmath125 .",
    "thus by substituting the computed eigenfunction into the variational expression a more precise determination of @xmath78 should result .",
    "this has indeed been confirmed @xcite .",
    "the second technique uses explicitly that the difference scheme [ eq : e3.11 ] , which is used by one version of the shooting technique , and the relaxation technique , is of second order . consequently the truncation errors in the eigenfrequency and eigenfunction scale as @xmath126 .",
    "if @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the eigenfrequencies obtained from solutions with @xmath129 and @xmath10 meshpoints , the leading - order error term therefore cancels in @xmath130 \\ ; . \\label{eq : e3.18}\\ ] ] this procedure , known as _ richardson extrapolation _ , was used by @xcite .",
    "it provides an estimate of the eigenfrequency that is substantially more accurate than @xmath131 , although of course at some added computational expense .",
    "indeed , since the error in the representation [ eq : e3.11 ] depends only on even powers of @xmath132 , the leading term of the error in @xmath133 is @xmath134 .    even with these techniques",
    "the precision of the computed frequencies may be inadequate if the mesh used in stellar - evolution calculations is used also for the computation of the oscillations .",
    "the number of meshpoints is typically relatively modest and the distribution may not reflect the requirement to resolve properly the eigenfunctions of the modes .",
    "@xcite discussed techniques to redistribute the mesh in a way that takes into account the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenfunctions ; a code to do so , based on four - point lagrangian interpolation , is included in the adipls distribution package .",
    "on the other hand , for computing low - order modes ( as are typically relevant for , say , @xmath135 scuti or @xmath136 cephei stars ) , the original mesh of the evolution calculation may be adequate .",
    "it is difficult to provide general recommendations concerning the required number of points or the need for redistribution , since this depends strongly on the types of modes and the properties of the stellar model .",
    "it is recommended to carry out experiments varying the number and distribution of points to obtain estimates of the intrinsic precision of the computation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the latter case , considering simple polytropic models , it was found that 4801 points yielded a relative precision substantially better than @xmath137 for high - order p modes , when richardson extrapolation was used .    in the discussion of the frequency calculation it is important to distinguish between _ precision _ and _ accuracy _ ,",
    "the latter obviously referring to the extent to which the computed frequencies represent what might be considered the ` true ' frequencies of the model .",
    "in particular , the manipulations required to derive eq .  [ eq : varprinc ] and to demonstrate its variational property depend on the equation of hydrostatic support being satisfied .",
    "if this is not the case , as might well happen in an insufficiently careful stellar model calculation , the value determined from the variational principle may be quite precise , in the sense of numerically stable , but still unacceptably far from the correct value .",
    "indeed , a comparison between @xmath138 and @xmath133 provides some measure of the reliability of the computed frequencies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the programme finds the order of the mode according to the definition developed by @xcite and @xcite , based on earlier work by @xcite .",
    "specifically , the order is defined by @xmath139 here the sum is over the zeros @xmath140 in @xmath59 ( excluding the centre ) , and @xmath141 is the sign function , @xmath142 if @xmath143 and @xmath144 if @xmath145 . for a complete model that includes the centre @xmath146 for radial oscillations and @xmath147 for nonradial oscillations .",
    "thus the lowest - order radial oscillation has order @xmath148 .",
    "although this is contrary to the commonly used convention of assigning order 0 to the fundamental radial oscillation , the convention used here is in fact the more reasonable , in the sense that it ensures that @xmath149 is invariant under a continuous variation of @xmath12 from 0 to 1 . with this definition @xmath150 for p modes , @xmath151 for f modes , and @xmath152 for g modes , at least in simple models .",
    "it has been found that this procedure has serious problems for dipolar modes in centrally condensed models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath59 are shifted such that nodes disappear or otherwise provide spurious results when eq .",
    "[ eq : e4.1 ] is used to determine the mode order . a procedure that does not suffer from this difficulty has recently been developed by @xcite",
    "; i discuss it further in section  [ sec : develop ] .    a powerful measure of the characteristics of a mode is provided by the _ normalized inertia_. the code calculates this as @xmath153   \\rho   r^2   { { \\rm d}}r \\over    m [ \\xi_r ( r_{\\rm phot } ) ^2 + l(l+1 ) { \\xi_{\\rm h}}(r_{\\rm phot } ) ^2 ] } \\nonumber \\\\    & = & { \\int_{x_1}^{{x_{\\rm s } } } \\left [ y_1 ^ 2    + y_2 ^ 2   / l ( l + 1 ) \\right ]   q u { { \\rm d}}x / x    \\over 4 \\pi [ y_1 ( x_{\\rm phot } ) ^2 + y_2 ( x_{\\rm phot } ) ^2/l(l+1 ) ] } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( for radial modes the terms in @xmath60 are not included . ) here @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the distance of the innermost mesh point from the centre and the surface radius , respectively , and @xmath156 is the fractional photospheric radius .",
    "the normalization at the photosphere is to some extent arbitrary , of course , but reflects the fact that many radial - velocity observations use lines formed relatively deep in the atmosphere .",
    "a more common definition of the inertia is @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the so - called _",
    "mode mass_.    the code has the option to output the eigenfunctions , in the form of @xmath159 .",
    "in addition ( or instead ) the displacement eigenfunctions can be output in a form indicating the region where the mode predominantly resides , in an energetical sense , as @xmath160 ( for radial modes only @xmath161 is found ) .",
    "these are defined in such a way that @xmath162   { { \\rm d}}x / x      \\over 4 \\pi [ y_1 ( x_{\\rm phot } ) ^2 + y_2 ( x_{\\rm phot } ) ^2/l(l+1 ) ] } \\ ; . \\label{eq : e4.4}\\ ] ] the form provided by the @xmath163 is also convenient , e.g. , for computing rotational splittings @xmath164 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , where @xmath165 is the frequency of a mode of radial order @xmath149 , degree @xmath12 and azimuthal order @xmath2 . for slow rotation",
    "the splittings are obtained from first - order perturbation analysis as @xmath166 characterized by _ kernels _",
    "@xmath167 , where in general the angular velocity @xmath168 depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath26 .",
    "the code has built in the option to compute kernels for first - order rotational splitting in the special case where @xmath168 depends only on @xmath1 .",
    "several revisions of the code have been implemented in preliminary form or are under development .",
    "a substantial improvement in the numerical solution of the oscillation equations , particularly for high - order modes , is the installation of a fourth - order integration scheme , based on the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "this is essentially operational but has so far not been carefully tested .",
    "comparisons with the results of the variational expression and the use of richardson extrapolation , of the same formal order , will be particularly interesting .    as discussed by @xcite the use of @xmath169 ( or , as here , @xmath170 ) as one of the integration variables has the disadvantage that the quantity @xmath171 enters into the oscillation equations .",
    "in models with a density discontinuity , such as results if the model has a growing convective core and diffusion is neglected , @xmath171 has a delta - function singularity at the point of the discontinuity . in the adipls calculations this",
    "is dealt with by replacing the discontinuity by a very steep and well - resolved slope .",
    "however , it would obviously be an advantage to avoid this problem altogether . this can be achieved by using instead the lagrangian pressure perturbation @xmath172 as one of the variables .",
    "implementing this option would be a relatively straightforward modification to the code and is under consideration .",
    "the proper classification of dipolar modes of low order in centrally condensed models has been a long - standing problem in the theory of stellar pulsations , as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "such a scheme must provide a unique order for each mode , such that the order is invariant under continuous changes of the equilibrium model , e.g. , as a result of stellar evolution . as a major breakthrough , takata in a series of papers has elucidated important properties of these modes and defined a new classification scheme satisfying this requirement @xcite .",
    "a preliminary version of this scheme has been implemented and tested ; however , the latest and most convenient form of the takata classification still needs to be installed .",
    "a version of the code has been established which computes the first - order rotational splitting for a given rotation profile @xmath173 , in addition to setting up the corresponding kernels .",
    "this is being extended by k. burke , sheffield , to cover also second - order effects of rotation , based on the formalism of @xcite .",
    "an important motivation for this is the integration , discussed by @xcite , of the pulsation calculation with the astec evolution code to allow full calculation of oscillation frequencies for a model of specified parameters ( mass , age , initial rotation rate , etc . ) as the result of a single subroutine call .",
