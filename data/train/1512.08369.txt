    "carbonate melts are liquids with remarkable physical and chemical properties that have recently received much attention  @xcite . in addition to being present in earth s upper mantle , they have also been increasingly used in various technological applications , either as bulk material or in composites with solid oxides or metals .",
    "molten carbonates are successfully used as electrolytes in _ molten carbonate fuel cells _ ( mcfc ) and are experimented in carbon capture and storage devices . yet , despite the importance of carbonate melts for both geophysical settings and industrial applications , a clear picture of the structure , dynamics and reactivity of molten carbonates at the molecular scale is still lacking . here , we set out to use molecular simulation methods to provide insight into the microscopic structure and dynamical properties of the @xmath2 eutectic mixture ( 62:38 mol% ) , which is of particular relevance for industrial applications as it is a standard electrolyte for molten carbonate fuel cells due to its high ionic conductivity and low eutectic temperature  @xcite .    _ first principles molecular dynamics _",
    "( fpmd ) simulations are one possible choice of simulation technique in order to simulate the carbonate melts . relying on quantum chemical calculations of the electronic structure at the _ density functional theory _ ( dft ) level",
    ", they do not require _ a priori _ knowledge of the molecular interactions in carbonate melts .",
    "fpmd simulations have been used with great success in recent years to calculate the equation of state of molten @xmath3  @xcite and the speciation and transport of @xmath4 in @xmath3  @xcite . however , first principles techniques are computationally very expensive , and therefore inherently strongly constrained on the time scales and system sizes that can be investigated in that manner . on the other hand , molecular dynamics ( md ) based on",
    "empirical force fields are less computationally demanding , but requiring careful parametrization . for our system of interest",
    ", we note that there have been so far relatively few attempts to derive force fields for molten alkali carbonates  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work we propose an optimized force field for the @xmath2 eutectic mixture , based on both experimental data and results from fpmd simulations .",
    "we then use this force field to study the thermodynamics , structure and dynamics of the molten mixture in the 9001100  k temperature range , at pressures up to 5  gpa .",
    "we focus in particular on the dynamical properties including the self diffusion coefficients , the viscosity and the ionic conductivity .",
    "in order to be able to provide reference structural information to optimize and validate our classical force field , we have first performed fpmd simulations on the @xmath2 ( 62:38 mol% ) eutectic mixture at the three target temperatures , @xmath5  k , @xmath6  k and @xmath7  k. we conduct these simulations using dft and the born  oppheneimer dynamics .",
    "we use the cp2k software package  @xcite and in particular the quickstep algorithm  @xcite , which employs a hybrid gaussian plane - wave method ( gpw )  @xcite for the electronic structure .",
    "the core electrons are replaced by using norm  conserving goedecker  teter  hutter ( gth ) pseudo - potentials  @xcite . for all atomic species",
    "we use a double - zeta valence plus polarization ( dzvp ) basis set optimized for molecules  @xcite .",
    "we cut off the electronic density at 700  ry and use a ` spline3 ` smoothing for applying the exchange  correlation potential .",
    "the latter is described thanks to the blyp functional  @xcite , with added dispersive interactions through the dft - d3 scheme  @xcite with a cutoff distance of 40   .",
    "the system studied by first - principles simulations is composed of 128 @xmath8 , 159 @xmath9 and 97 @xmath10 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we adjust the box length in order to prepare the system at the experimental density at atmospheric pressure  @xcite and we run the simulations in the @xmath11 ensemble .",
    "the temperature is controlled by using the csvr thermostat  @xcite with a time constant of 1  ps .",
    "we employ a simulation time step of 0.5  fs and the total simulation time is 30  ps . the initial configurations had been obtained by classical md using the tissen and janssen force field  @xcite .",
    "relatively few attempts have been previously made to derive a force field for molten alkali carbonates  @xcite . the force field developed by tissen and janssen  @xcite for pure lithium , sodium and potassium carbonate salts , and",
    "later also used to study mixtures  @xcite , treats the carbonate molecule as rigid . in this simple force field ,",
    "the interaction potential between the atoms is simply given by the sum of the coulombic potential and a born  type repulsive term .",
    "partial charges are used for the atoms composing the @xmath8 units , while formal charges are used for the cations .",
    "costa and ribeiro  @xcite have compared the results obtained using the force field by tissen and janssen to the ones produced by a force field in which the polarizability of the anion is added in the form of fluctuating partial charges , showing a large impact on the prediction of transport properties .    here , in light of the length of the runs needed to converge the calculation of dynamical quantities such as diffusion coefficients , ionic conductivity and viscosity , we limit ourselves to a non  polarizable force field .",
    "the complexity of the force field used is however somewhat increased with respect the tissen and janssen model . for the derivation of our classical force field for @xmath2 ,",
    "we start from the force field obtained for @xmath3 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we consider flexible @xmath8 ions .",
    "the c  o pairs in carbonate interact via harmonic terms : @xmath12 with @xmath13  kj/(mol @xmath14 ) , @xmath15   , and where `` intra '' means that the sum is taken only for o in the same carbonate molecule of the corresponding c. the carbonate molecule is prevented from folding by adding exponential repulsion terms between o atoms of the kind : @xmath16 with @xmath17  kj / mol and @xmath18   .",
    "the non  bonded ( or intermolecular ) part of the force field includes a coulombic part , a repulsive term and a dispersive term , with its analytical form being : @xmath19 where `` nb '' means that the sum is taken only over non - bonded pairs of atoms .",
    "we use the same partial charges as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is to say @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we had initially attempted to reoptimize these charges , but any significant change leads to drastic deterioration of the pressures and densities of the system when compared to experimental data .",
    "we thus proceed to adjust the interaction parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 by manual tuning in order to reproduce at best both the experimental density by constant - pressure @xmath26 simulations and the pair radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) , as obtained from first - principles molecular dynamics ( fpmd ) simulations , by constant - volume @xmath11 simulations .",
