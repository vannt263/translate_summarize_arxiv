    "this can always be done if a system described by ( [ h ] ) is rotationally symmetric , and thus contains the so(3 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "the presence of a nonzero @xmath0 field , on the other hand , breaks the rotational symmetry , [ e.g. the linear zeeman shift , reduces the so(3 ) to so(2 ) symmetry ] , thus the conservation of @xmath3 has to be included in the minimization process directly .",

    "although more limited , as our results can be traced to linear trajectories of @xmath46 in the phase diagram of ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect them to be useful , especially in predicting ground state structures when a ready - made spinor condensate is subjected to external manipulations that conserve both @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "when atomic interactions are anti - ferromagnetic ( @xmath47 ) , the global ground state was first determined to be a total spin singlet @xcite .",
    "more elaborate studies , including quantum fluctuations , were performed by ho and yip @xcite and koashi and ueda @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these results @xcite do not correspond to actual ground states as realized in current experiments , because of the presence of background magnetic fields .",
    "for instance , the states as found in ref .",
    "@xcite are only possible if the magnetic field @xmath0 is less than @xmath48 g at the condensate density as realized in the mit experiments @xcite .",
    "the zeeman shift ( see fig . [ eta - delta ] ) due to the presence of even a small magnetic field can overwhelm atomic mean field interaction and typical atomic thermal energy , thus if it were not for the conservation of @xmath3 , the ground state would simply correspond to all atoms condense into the lowest zeeman sublevel of @xmath49 .",
