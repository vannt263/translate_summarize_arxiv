    "many lower - dimensional antiferromagnets show a singlet ground state and an energy gap in their excitation spectrum originating from quantum many body effects .",
    "the first indication of the quantum energy gap came out in 1983 .",
    "haldane@xcite conjectured that the excitation spectrum of one - dimensional ( 1d ) heisenberg antiferromagnets ( hafs ) with integer spin quantum number ( @xmath0 ) has an energy gap between the ground and first excited states , while the corresponding system with half - odd integer @xmath0 has no energy gap .",
    "this conjecture has been tested both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the quantum energy gap ( haldane gap ) does exist in 1d hafs with integer @xmath0 .",
    "in real materials , there always exists an interaction between spin chains .",
    "we call this class of materials a quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) magnet .",
    "usually q1d antiferromagnets exhibit a long - range ordering ( lro ) at finite temperature due to the inter - chain coupling ( @xmath11)@xcite . the compound ni(c@xmath3h@xmath12n@xmath3)@xmath3no@xmath3(clo@xmath13 ) , abbreviated nenp , is a typical example of @xmath0=1 q1d hafs@xcite and does not show any indication of lro down to 300 @xmath14k@xcite , whereas the @xmath0=1 q1d haf csnicl@xmath4 shows lro at @xmath154.7 k@xcite . the different behavior between the two compounds comes from the difference in the strength of @xmath11 .",
    "how robust is the haldane phase in a q1d haf against perturbation ?",
    "sakai and takahashi@xcite studied theoretically the ground state properties of an @xmath0=1 q1d haf with a single - ion anisotropy of the form @xmath16 .",
    "they showed that the haldane disordered phase exists for @xmath17@xmath180.05 in a rather wide range of @xmath19 values , where @xmath20 is the number of neighboring chains and @xmath21 is the intra - chain exchange interaction .",
    "as was demonstrated experimentally@xcite , strong magnetic fields destroy the haldane gap and the system recovers magnetism .",
    "then , we expect a magnetic ordering to occur in an @xmath0=1 q1d haf under high fields and at low temperatures .",
    "the heat capacity measurement made on nenp in magnetic fields did not reveal any indication of lro@xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that an external magnetic field applied along the chain axis of nenp induces a staggered field on the ni@xmath22 sites because of the presence of two crystallographically inequivalent sites for ni@xmath22@xcite .",
    "this staggered field causes a small energy gap near the transition field from the disordered to the magnetized states@xcite and thus prevents the occurrence of lro at low temperatures .",
    "we have reported the observation of a field - induced lro in the @xmath0=1 q1d haf ni(c@xmath1h@xmath2n@xmath3)@xmath3n@xmath4(clo@xmath13 ) , abbreviated ndmaz@xcite , and in ni(c@xmath1h@xmath2n@xmath3)@xmath3n@xmath4(pf@xmath5 ) , abbreviated ndmap@xcite . since there is only one site for ni@xmath22 in ndmaz and mamap , these compounds are ideal for studying the field - induced lro . from a heat capacity ( @xmath23 )",
    "measurement on a single crystal sample of ndmaz , we have observed an anomaly at about 0.6 k and 12 t@xcite which indicated that a magnetic ordering occurred there .",
    "because of limitations in our calorimeter , we were unable to follow how the position of the anomaly in @xmath23 changes with temperature ( @xmath24 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we then tried to synthesize the @xmath0=1 q1d haf , ndmap , with a weaker @xmath21 than ndmaz so that lro is expected to be induced at a lower field .",
    "we have measured @xmath24 and @xmath6 dependence of @xmath23 in a single crystal sample of ndmap and constructed the @xmath6-@xmath24 phase diagram@xcite .",
    "we found an anisotropy in the phase boundary curve separating the paramagnetic and lro phases , and we presented a qualitative interpretation for this anisotropy@xcite .",
    "electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements made on a single crystal of ndmap gave further evidence for the existence of the field - induced lro phase and of the anisotropy in the phase boundary curve.@xcite    in this paper we report detailed results of heat capacity and magnetization measurements made on ndmap .",

    "we use hereafter this @xmath44 term to subtract the contribution of lattice heat capacity as has been done by many authors .",

    "we see an anomaly in @xmath45 at finite fields above a critical value .",
    "this anomaly signals that a magnetic ordering occurs there .",
    "one of the advantages of our calorimeter is that a field dependent @xmath23 can be measured under a constant temperature@xcite . strictly speaking",
    ", we need to change temperature to measure @xmath23 .",
    "however , the temperature increment necessary for the measurement is 0.5 - 1 % of the temperature we set so that temperature change during the measurement may be considered as small .",
    "figures 4(a)-(c ) show such `` field scan '' data measured at several temperatures for the magnetic field directions parallel to the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 axes , respectively .",
    "in addition to the sharp peak at the field denoted by @xmath46 , a broad feature is seen around the field named as @xmath47 .",
    "here , @xmath46 means the position of @xmath6 at which the field - induced lro occurs for a given @xmath24 .    combining all the information obtained from the heat capacity measurements , both of the `` temperature scan '' and `` field scan '' procedures , we present the @xmath6-@xmath24 phase diagram of ndmap in fig .",

    "6(a)-(c ) show the temperature dependence of susceptibility ( magnetization divided by applied magnetic field , @xmath48 ) in ndmap measured in magnetic fields applied parallel to the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 axes , respectively .",
    "the behavior of the susceptibility at @xmath6= 1 t is reminiscent of that taken at a much lower field ( @xmath6= 0.01 t)@xcite ; a broad peak around 35 k and a steep decrease in susceptibility with decreasing temperature below about 20 k. on increasing @xmath6 , @xmath48 does not extrapolate to zero with @xmath24@xmath490 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath48 is similar to the one observed in an @xmath0=@xmath50 1d haf@xcite and indicates that a transition from the gapped to a gapless phase occurs at a higher field . on increasing @xmath6 further",
    ", @xmath48 shows a minimum and an up turn at low temperatures .",
    "the insets of figs .",
    "6(a)-(c ) show the low temperature part of the data .",
    "we see in the inset of figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) that @xmath48 becomes almost temperature independent below a temperature whose value is field dependent .",
    "the temperature independent susceptibility reminds us of the perpendicular susceptibility ( @xmath51 ) of an anisotropic antiferromagnet below the nel temperature ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we show below that we are actually observing @xmath51 in this compound .",
    "because the sign of the single - ion anisotropy term ( @xmath16 ) is positive in this compound , spins in the ordered phase are expected to lie in a plane perpendicular to the @xmath10 axis ( the quantization axis of the @xmath19 term is taken parallel to the @xmath10 axis ) .",
    "the anisotropy in the @xmath10 plane of the form @xmath52 is very small@xcite .",
    "therefore , when @xmath6 is applied along the @xmath8 or @xmath9 axes , spins point perpendicularly to @xmath6 in the @xmath10 plane keeping an antiferromagnetic arrangement , thus giving @xmath51 .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "5 the transition points obtained from the @xmath48 data shown in fig .",
    "these points are defined as the temperatures where @xmath53 shows a minimum for a given @xmath6 .",
    "we see that the transition points determined from the heat capacity and magnetization measurements agree well with each other .",
    "in this section , we try to reproduce the @xmath6-@xmath24 phase diagram observed in ndmap , exhibiting an interesting behavior of @xmath7 as a function of @xmath6 : at low temperatures , there occurs lro only above a certain critical field and @xmath7 shows an increase with increasing fields , the rate of which depends on the direction of @xmath6 .",
    "we focus our attention especially on the physics behind the phase diagram . to this end",
    ", we adopt the mean - field approximation for the interchain interaction@xcite , which is known to work quite well except for fields in the vicinity of the critical field . in the following ,",
    "we use the energy unit @xmath21=1 , so that @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are renormalized quantities of @xmath24 , @xmath58 , @xmath11 and @xmath19 , respectively . according to the mean - field theory ,",
    "the renormalized nel temperature @xmath59 as a function of the renormalized field @xmath55 is given by the solution satisfying the following equation : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the staggered susceptibility for the _ one - dimensional _ magnetic system .",
    "then , we calculate the staggered susceptibility of the magnetic chain by means of the quantum transfer matrix method combined with the finite - temperature density matrix renormalization group .",
    "as was mentioned in the previous section , ni@xmath22 spins in ndmap has an easy - plane anisotropy , and thus the magnetic chain is well described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 represents the spin-@xmath64 operator at the @xmath65th site . neglecting the small anisotropy in the @xmath10 plane",
    ", we consider the following two cases for the field @xmath55 applied ( i ) along the @xmath20(@xmath10)-axis ( perpendicular to the easy plane ) and ( ii ) along the @xmath66-axis ( in the easy plane ) .",
    "it is noted here that the situation is quite different between the two cases , since the former field reserves the axial symmetry around the @xmath10-axis while the latter breaks it .",
    "the nature of quantum fluctuations and hence the staggered susceptibility depends crucially on the symmetry of the system . in the following , we consider the two cases separately .",
    "\\(i ) _ the field applied perpendicularly to the easy plane _ ( @xmath67 ) + as was mentioned , below the critical field @xmath68 the nonmagnetic haldane phase called a quantum disordered phase is the ground state of the system , while above it the so called tomonaga - luttinger liquid state becomes the ground state . although the former has an excitation gap to the triplet state , the latter has a gapless excitation spectrum and hence is critical .",
    "this criticality of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid is characterized by the critical exponent @xmath69 defined by the divergence of the staggered susceptibility at zero temperature@xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a constant , which scarcely depends on @xmath55 in our calculation .",
    "note that in the classical system @xmath72 .",
    "we may safely use eq .",
    "( 4 ) at low temperatures well below the temperature at which the susceptibility is maximum ( @xmath1535 k ) . in fig . 7 ,",
    "@xmath69 s , estimated from the numerical calculations for the temperature region @xmath73 , are shown by the solid circles , each of which has an error bar of @xmath74 .",
    "the data have been shifted in fields so that the theoretical critical field coincides with the one observed .",
    "the solid curve represents the phenomenological relation between @xmath69 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "now , we reproduce the phase diagram , using eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4 ) with @xmath79k@xcite . in fig .",
    "8 we show the theoretical result by the solid curve and the experimental data by the solid circles . here , we adjusted the theoretical curve to reproduce the experimental point @xmath80 k at 11 t. from figs . 7 and 8 , we see that the increase of @xmath7 with @xmath6 is a consequence of the decrease in @xmath69 with @xmath6 . remembering that @xmath69 measures the degree of quantum fluctuations , we can say that the quantum fluctuation out of the easy plane is reduced by @xmath6 so that the nel state becomes more stable .",
    "in contrast to this quantum system , the field dependence of the constant @xmath71 is an only source of the field dependence of @xmath7 in the classical system , being very mild .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "7 @xmath69 estimated from the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "5 ) by the open circles , which follows also the phenomenological relation but @xmath81 . considering the large error bars in @xmath69 of our estimations",
    ", we do not think the discrepancy in @xmath82 so seriously .",
    "observation of the field dependence of @xmath69 by other methods is desired .    in stronger fields , spins ca nt in the field direction and hence @xmath71 decreases seriously .",
    "thus , the phase boundary curve closes at the upper critical field , where the magnetic moment saturates . from the phase diagram",
    ", we estimate the interchain coupling @xmath83 to be @xmath84 , using the value @xmath85 . this value",
    "is favorably compared with that obtained from the neutron inelastic scattering experiments ( 2@xmath86 + 2@xmath87=@xmath88@xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) _ the field applied in the easy plane _ ( @xmath89 ) + in this case , above @xmath68 , the ground state has the nel order and a gap opens again in the excitation spectrum because of the symmetry breaking field .",
    "this situation is quite different from the former case .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath7 reminds us of the _ soliton scenario _ in the classical system@xcite . remembering the form of the staggered susceptibility in the classical system , we postulate the following in this case : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant .",
    "this form is confirmed by our numerical calculations , in the temperature region @xmath73 , with the coefficient @xmath92 , a little less than unity .",
    "although @xmath92 may represent quantum effects in the formation energy of soliton , we assume , for simplicity , the classical value 1 for it .",
    "now , we again reproduce the phase diagram for this case using eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "the theoretical curves are adjusted as before using the experimental point @xmath93 k at 12 t and the critical field value @xmath94 t for @xmath55 parallel to the @xmath8-axis , and @xmath95 k at 12 t and @xmath96 t for @xmath55 parallel to the @xmath9-axis , respectively .",
    "the different values of @xmath97 are due to an in - plane anisotropy , being neglected in this paper .",
    "the phase boundary curves are shown by the solid curve for @xmath55 parallel to the @xmath8-axis and by the dotted curve for @xmath55 parallel to the @xmath9-axis with the corresponding experimental points , respectively , by the solid and the open circles in fig .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is satisfactory .",
    "we mention that the soliton scenario still works in our quantum system : the symmetry breaking field yields the uniaxial symmetry and hence the soliton is a dominant source for the fluctuations in this system .",
    "since the soliton formation energy , i.e. the gap , increases with @xmath98 and hence the staggered susceptibility increases exponentially at low temperatures , @xmath7 shows a rapid increase with @xmath6 , the rate of which is marked contrast with the former case .",
    "although the soliton scenario is effective in our case , more sophisticated study is required to establish further a quantum analogue of the soliton in classical spin chains .",
    "the phase boundary curve closes also at the upper critical field as in the former case .",
    "we estimate the interchain coupling @xmath83 to be @xmath99 , using the value @xmath100 .",
    "the value @xmath56 estimated again agrees with the value observed@xcite .",
    "iii , we have presented detailed results of heat capacity and magnetization measurements on ndmap from which we have constructed the @xmath6-@xmath24 phase diagram shown in fig .",

    "iv using the values of intra - chain exchange interaction and anisotropy constants determined from the neutron inelastic scattering measurements@xcite .",
    "the inter - chain exchange interactions estimated theoretically are close to those obtained from the neutron experiment@xcite .",
    "we discuss the lower field boundary separating the haldane and paramagnetic phases ( curve ( b ) in fig .",
    "we argue below that the anomaly in @xmath45 observed along this curve is due to the field dependence of the first excited triplet@xcite .",
    "we analyzed the low temperature part of the magnetic heat capacity data using a two - level system model , with a singlet ground state and the lowest state of the excited triplet with an energy difference ( @xmath101 ) , which gives a schottky type anomaly .",

    "we see a good agreement between theory and experiment without any adjustable parameters . we have obtained the value @xmath108=30.0 k from a fitting of the theory with the susceptibility data at high temperature range above about 40 k@xcite .",
    "because the lattice parameters change with temperature@xcite , it is not surprizing if the exchange interaction constant determined at low temperatures is different from that at high temperatures .",
    "figure 11(b ) shows the case when @xmath6 is applied along the @xmath10 axis .",

    "<S> detailed results of heat capacity and magnetization measurements are reported on a single crystal sample of the spin @xmath0=1 quasi - one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet ni(c@xmath1h@xmath2n@xmath3)@xmath3n@xmath4(pf@xmath5 ) , abbreviated ndmap . from these results </S>",
    "<S> , we constructed the magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) versus temperature phase diagram of this compound which exhibits the quantum disordered haldane , field - induced long - range - ordered ( lro ) and thermally disordered paramagnetic phases . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundary curve separating the paramagnetic and lro phases is anisotropic ; the increase of the nel temperature ( @xmath7 ) with @xmath6 along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axes is more rapid than that along the @xmath10 axis . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated @xmath7 as a function of @xmath6 by taking into account the inter chain coupling as the form of a mean - field . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the staggered susceptibility of the @xmath0=1 one - dimensional antiferromagnet with an easy - plane anisotropy shows quite different behavior in the different field directions , resulting in the anisotropic phase boundary curve . </S>",
    "<S> a good agreement is obtained between theory and experiment using the exchange and anisotropy constants obtained from the neutron scattering experiment . </S>"
