    "<S> on a weakly blackwell space we show how to define a markov chain approximating problem , for the target problem . </S>",
    "<S> the approximating problem is proved to converge to the optimal reduced problem under different pseudometrics . </S>",
    "<S> a computational example of compression of information is discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath0 be an homogeneous markov chain . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the process stops once it reaches an absorbing class , called the target , according to a given stopping rule : the resulting problem is called target problem ( tp ) . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to reduce the available information in order to only use the necessary information which is relevant with respect to the target . </S>",
    "<S> a new markov chain , associated with a new equivalent but reduced matrix is defined . in the ( large ) finite case </S>",
    "<S> , the problem has been solved for tps : in @xcite , it has been proved that any tp on a finite set of states has its `` best target '' equivalent markov chain . moreover , this chain is unique and there exists a polynomial time algorithm to reach this optimum .    </S>",
    "<S> the question is now to find , in generality , an @xmath1approximation of the markov problem when the state space is measurable . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to merge into one group the points that @xmath1-behave the same with respect to the objective , but also in order to keep an almost equivalent markov chain , with respect to the other `` groups '' . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of these groups is done through equivalence relations and hence each group corresponds to a class of equivalence . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there are many other mathematical fields where approximation problems are faced by equivalences . for instance , in integration theory , we use simple functions , in functional analysis , we use the density of countable generated subspaces and in numerical analysis , we use the finite elements method .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the approximation is made by means of discrete equivalences , which will be defined in the following . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of any approximation is to reach the exact solution when @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the sequence of approximations tends to the optimal exact equivalence relation defined in @xcite , when we refine the groups . </S>",
    "<S> finer equivalence will imply better approximation , and accordingly the limit will be defined as a countably generated equivalence .    under a very general blackwell type hypothesis on the measurable space </S>",
    "<S> , we show that it is equivalent to speak on countably generated equivalence relationships or on measurable real functions on the measurable space of states . </S>",
    "<S> if we do not work under this framework of blackwell spaces , we can be faced to paradoxes , as it is explained by @xcite , of enlarging @xmath3algebras , while decreasing the information available to a decision - maker . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1approximation of the markov chain depends always upon the kind of objective . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> jerrum deals with ergodic markov chains . </S>",
    "<S> his objective is to approximate the stationary distribution by means of a discrete approximating markov chain , whose limit distribution is close in a certain sense to the original one . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike our following work , his purpose is not the explicit and unified construction of the approximating process . in this paper , we focus on the target problem . </S>",
    "<S> we solve extensively the tp , where the objective is connected with the conditional probability of reaching the target @xmath4 , namely @xmath5 , for any @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this part extends the work in @xcite , since tps approximation may help to understand the behavior of those tps where the best equivalent markov chain is also very large . </S>",
    "<S> the setting of an approximating problem can be extended to a general form , but we will not develop it in this paper . </S>"
