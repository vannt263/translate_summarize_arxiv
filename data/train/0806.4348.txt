    "as is well known , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is confining at low energy .",
    "confinement means that it is impossible to detect free quarks and gluons in the low momentum region as quarks form colorless bound states like baryons and mesons .",
    "even if one omits the quarks , pure @xmath0 yang - mills gauge theory remains confining as gluons form bound states known as glueballs .",
    "hitherto , confinement is still poorly understood .",
    "there is a widespread belief that the infrared behavior of the gluon and ghost propagator is deeply related to the issue of confinement and , therefore , these propagators have been widely investigated . in this paper",
    ", we shall use the following conventions for the gluon and the ghost propagator , @xmath1 until recently , lattice results have shown an infrared suppressed , positivity violating gluon propagator which seemed to tend towards zero for zero momentum , i.e. @xmath2 , and a ghost propagator which was believed to be enhanced in the infrared @xcite , @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "different analytical approaches were in agreement with these results ( e.g.  @xcite ) to quote only a few ) .",
    "for instance , several works based on the schwinger - dyson or exact renormalization group equations reported an infrared enhanced ghost propagator and an infrared suppressed , vanishing gluon propagator , obeying a power law behavior characterized by a unique infrared exponent , as stated by a sum rule discussed in @xcite .",
    "the infrared propagators have also been studied from a thermodynamical viewpoint in @xcite .",
    "also the gribov - zwanziger action predicts an infrared enhanced ghost propagator and a zero - momentum vanishing gluon propagator @xcite .",
    "this action was constructed in order to analytically implement the restriction to the gribov region @xmath5 , defined as the set of field configurations fulfilling the landau gauge condition and for which the faddeev - popov operator , @xmath6 is strictly positive , namely @xmath7 the boundary , @xmath8 , of the region @xmath5 is called the ( first ) gribov horizon .",
    "this restriction is necessary to avoid the appearance of gribov copies in the landau gauge related to gauge transformations @xcite .",
    "however , this region @xmath5 still contains a number of gribov copies and is therefore still `` larger '' than the fundamental modular region ( fmr ) , which is completely free of gribov copies .",
    "unfortunately , it is unknown how to treat the fmr analytically @xcite .",
    "+ however , more recent lattice data @xcite at larger volumes display an infrared suppressed , positivity violating gluon propagator , which is _ nonvanishing _ at zero momentum , , i.e. @xmath9 , and a ghost propagator which is _ no longer enhanced _ , @xmath10 .",
    "this implies that the previous mentioned analytical approaches are not conclusive .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , recently , the authors of @xcite have obtained a solution of the schwinger - dyson equations which is in agreement with the latest lattice data .",
    "furthermore , as we have shown in a previous work @xcite , this agreement can also be found within the gribov - zwanziger approach . in this framework , we have added a novel mass term to the original gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "this new term corresponds to the introduction of a dimension 2 operator .",
    "we recall that by including condensates , which are the vacuum expectation value of certain local operators , one can take into account nonperturbative effects which play an important role in the infrared region . during the course of the current work",
    ", it shall become clear that we also have to add an additional vacuum term to the action , which will allow us to stay within the gribov region @xmath5 .",
    "the previous paper @xcite only gave a brief account of the consequences of adding the mass operator to the original gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "for this reason , here we shall present an extensive study of the gribov - zwanziger action with the inclusion of the new parts .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is fourfold , and it is organized as follows .",
    "the first aim , discussed in section ii , is to give a detailed proof of the renormalizability of the extended action .",
    "therefore , we first present an overview of the gribov - zwanziger action , @xmath11 , in the landau gauge which implements the restriction the gribov region @xmath5 .",
    "next , we add the local composite operator @xmath12 to this action and we prove the renormalizability of this extended action , @xmath13 .",
    "subsequently , we show that by adding another term , @xmath14 $ ] , the renormalizability is not destroyed . in summary ,",
    "section ii establishes the renormalizability of the action @xmath15 .",
    "the second aim , investigated in section iii , is to demonstrate that this extra term enables us to obtain propagators which exhibit the desired behavior . in particular , the tree level gluon propagator is calculated explicitly and the ghost propagator is determined up to one loop .",
    "both the ghost and the gluon propagator are in qualitative agreement with the latest lattice results . up to this point",
    ", we have added this mass term by hand .",
    "hence , a third aim is to obtain a dynamical value for @xmath16 .",
    "section iv presents this dynamical value .",
    "an estimate for the one loop gluon propagator at zero momentum as well as for the ghost propagator at low momenta is given .",
    "also , the positivity violation of the gluon propagator is scrutinized and compared with the available lattice data .",
    "the last aim is to highlight the brst breaking of the gribov - zwanziger action , which is presented in detail in section v. we already stress here that it is the restriction to the gribov region @xmath5 , implemented by the gribov - zwanziger action , which induces the explicit breaking of the brst symmetry .",
    "further , we provide a few remarks on the maggiore - schaden approach to the issue of the brst breaking @xcite , and we revisit a few aspects of the kugo - ojima confinement criterion @xcite .",
    "we end this paper with a discussion in section vi .",
    "we begin with an overview of the action constructed by zwanziger @xcite which implements the restriction to the gribov region @xmath5 @xcite in euclidean yang - mills theories in the landau gauge .",
    "we start from the following action , @xmath17 with @xmath18 the classical yang - mills action , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the so called horizon function , @xmath21 the parameter @xmath22 , known as the gribov parameter is not free and is determined by the horizon condition : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of space - time dimensions .",
    "the nonlocal horizon function can be localized through a suitable set of additional fields .",
    "the complete localized action reads @xmath25 with @xmath26 the fields @xmath27 are a pair of complex conjugate bosonic fields , while @xmath28 are anticommuting fields .",
    "each of these fields has @xmath29 components .",
    "we can easily see that the action @xmath30 displays a global @xmath31 symmetry , @xmath32 , with respect to the composite index @xmath33 , of the additional fields @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we simplify the notation of these fields by setting @xmath35 so we get @xmath36    now we shall try to translate the horizon condition into a more practical version @xcite . the local action @xmath37 and",
    "the nonlocal action @xmath38 are related as follows , @xmath39 if we take the partial derivative of both sides with respect to @xmath40 we obtain , @xmath41 using this last expression and assuming that @xmath42 , we can rewrite the horizon condition @xmath43 we know that the quantum action @xmath44 is obtained through the definition @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for the integration over all the fields .",
    "it is now easy to see that @xmath47 is exactly equivalent with equation .",
    "therefore , equation represents the horizon condition .",
    "we remark that the condition also includes the solution @xmath48 .",
    "however , @xmath49 would correspond to the case in which the restriction to the gribov region would not have been implemented .",
    "as such , the value @xmath49 has to be disregarded as an artefact due to the reformulation of the horizon condition . +",
    "as it has been proven in @xcite , the gribov - zwanziger action @xmath37 is renormalizable to all orders . in the next section",
    ", we shall give an overview of this renormalizability , but with the insertion of the local composite operator @xmath50 , to extend the action further .",
    "obviously , the renormalizability of this extended action @xmath51 also includes the renormalizability of the ordinary gribov - zwanziger action @xmath37 .",
    "if we add the local composite operator @xmath53 to one can prove @xcite that the following action is renormalizable to all orders @xmath54 with @xmath55 with @xmath56 a new source and @xmath57 a new parameter .",
    "we now go a little bit more into the details of the renormalization of this action , as it will be useful later .",
    "we remark that if we prove the renormalizability of the action @xmath51 , we have also proven the renormalizability of @xmath58 just by putting @xmath56 equal to zero .",
    "we will use the method of algebraic renormalization @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , this means that we will embed the action @xmath51 into a larger action by adding new sources , so it will display a greater number of symmetries .",
    "these symmetries are important as they will imply constraints on the possible allowed counterterm .",
    "the larger the number of symmetries , the more limitations we will find on the counterterm .",
    "this will lead to a bigger possibility to absorb the counterterm into the original action , thereby proving the renormalizability . in the end",
    ", we give the sources the correct physical values , so we obtain the action @xmath51 again .",
    "+ we shall now implement , step by step , this method of algebraic renormalization .",
    "firstly , we introduce two local external sources @xmath59 ,  @xmath60 so we can treat @xmath61 and @xmath62 as composite operators just like @xmath63 .",
    "hence , we replace the term @xmath64 by @xmath65 if we set the sources to their physical values in the end @xmath66 we obtain , as requested , the term @xmath64 defined in .",
    "+ secondly , the algebraic renormalization procedure requires this action to be brst invariant .",
    "therefore , we further introduce three extra sources @xmath67 ,  @xmath68 and @xmath69 and replace @xmath70 by @xmath71 where the brst transformations of all the fields and sources are : @xmath72 and @xmath73 we recall that the brst operator @xmath74 is nilpotent , meaning that @xmath75 .",
    "we mention again that by replacing the sources with their physical values in the end @xmath76 one recovers the original terms @xmath77 .",
    "+ finally , a term @xmath78 , @xmath79 was added , which is needed to define the nonlinear brst transformations of the gauge and ghost fields . @xmath80 and @xmath81 are two new sources , invariant under the brst symmetry @xmath74 and with @xmath82 the enlarged action is thus given by @xmath83 and one easily sees that the action @xmath84 is indeed brst invariant .",
    "this action now enjoys a larger number of ward identities summarized as follows :    .quantum numbers of the fields .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the corresponding @xmath85 is depicted in .",
    "both the @xmath86-axis and @xmath87-axis are shown in units fm ( @xmath88 fm ) , in order to compare our results with @xcite . not only do we find a positivity violating gluon propagator as @xmath89 becomes negative , but even the shape of this function is consistent with the lattice results @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the positivity violation starts from @xmath90 fm , in good agreement with our results . finally , fig .",
    "[ ctg ] displays the corresponding values of @xmath91 .",

    "at the perturbative level , this is assured by the ward identity , @xmath100 .",
    "usually , this is assumed to remain valid at the nonperturbative level .",
    "although this can not be proven , this hypothesis has been corroborated by lattice studies like @xcite .",
    "+ in recent years , there was accumulating evidence that @xmath101 would reach an infrared fixed point different from zero : see e.g. @xcite for a schwinger - dyson analysis , @xcite in the ordinary gribov - zwanziger approach and @xcite for lattice results .",
    "these studies are mostly done in a mom renormalization scheme , with the exception of @xcite where the @xmath102 scheme was employed .",
    "the manifestation of this infrared fixed point was motivated in schwinger - dyson studies and the ordinary gribov - zwanziger case by means of the power law behavior of the form factors , @xmath103 being expressable in terms of a single exponent @xmath104 . the schwinger - dyson community heralded in a variety of studies the value @xmath105 , whereas the gribov - zwanziger scenario gives @xmath106 .",
    "anyhow , substituting a behavior like into the definition leads to @xmath107 , opening the door for a finite value .",
    "+ however , once again quoting the more recent large volume lattice data of @xcite , the power law behavior seem to be excluded in favor of @xmath108 leading to a vanishing infrared effective strong coupling constant at zero momentum since @xmath109 .",
    "the refined analysis in this paper of the extended gribov - zwanziger action , including an additional dynamical effect , allows us to draw a similar conclusion up to the one loop level , i.e. an infrared vanishing @xmath110 .",
    "certain lattice studies also pointed towards this particular scenario @xcite .",
    "we recall here that the gribov - zwanziger action is not invariant under the brst transformation .",
    "indeed , if we take the brst variation of the action , one finds a breaking term @xmath111 given by @xmath112 we see that the presence of the gribov parameter @xmath22 prevents the action from being invariant under the brst symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , this fact does not prevent the use of the slavnov - taylor identity to prove the renormalizability of the theory , which is very remarkable .",
    "since the breaking @xmath113 is soft , i.e.  it is of dimension two in the fields , it can be neglected in the deep ultraviolet , where we recover the usual notion of exact brst invariance as well as of brst cohomology for defining the physical subspace @xcite .",
    "however , in the nonperturbative infrared region , the breaking term can not be neglected and the brst invariance is lost . in the following ,",
    "we shall present a detailed analysis of this breaking and of its consequences .",
    "in particular , we shall be able to prove that the origin of this breaking can be traced back to the properties of the gribov region @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the existence of this breaking enables us to give an elementary algebraic proof of the fact that the gribov parameter @xmath22 is a physical parameter of the theory , entering thus the expression of the correlation functions of gauge invariant operators .",
    "+      the reader might wonder whether the gluon propagator still remains transverse in the presence of the gribov horizon . as the gluon propagator is the connected two - point function",
    ", we ought to consider the generator @xmath114 of connected green functions , which can be constructed from the quantum effective action @xmath44 by means of a legendre transformation .",
    "the renormalizability of the theory entails that @xmath44 obeys the renormalized version of the ward identity , or @xmath115 introducing sources @xmath116 for the fields @xmath117 and performing the legendre transformation , the identity translates into @xmath118 acting with @xmath119 on this expression , and by setting all sources equal to zero , we retrieve @xmath120 which expresses nothing else but the transversality of the gluon propagator .",
    "let us present here a few considerations on the consequences stemming from the brst breaking @xmath113 appearing in the left hand side of equation of the slavnov - taylor identity .",
    "our argument will follow @xcite .",
    "we start from the generalized slavnov - taylor identity which is fulfilled by the enlarged action @xmath84 .",
    "the quantum effective action , @xmath121 , obeys the quantum version of this slavnov - taylor identity @xcite , @xmath122 we now pass to the gribov - zwanziger action , defined by giving the sources ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) their physical values and . as a consequence , the physical quantum effective action @xmath127 will now obey a broken slavnov - taylor identity , @xmath128 + g \\gamma^2 \\left [ \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^4 x f^{abc } \\left(d_{\\mu}^{am } c^m\\right)\\left ( \\overline{\\varphi}^{bc}_\\mu + \\varphi^{bc}_{\\mu}\\right ) \\cdot \\gamma_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{phys } } } } \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = &   -\\left [ \\delta_{\\gamma } \\cdot \\gamma_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{phys } } } } \\right ]   \\ ; , \\label{stdelta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereby @xmath129 $ ] represents the generator of the 1pi green functions with the insertion of the composite operator @xmath113",
    ". expression generalizes at the quantum level the broken identity of equation . once having a slavnov - taylor identity like at our disposal",
    ", we can obtain relations between different green functions by acting on it with test operators @xmath130 , with @xmath131 any field , and by setting all fields and sources equal to zero at the end .",
    "the breaking term in the r.h.s .  of expression will be translated into an extra contribution . in particular , we shall obtain @xmath132}{\\delta \\psi(x_1 ) \\ldots\\delta \\psi(x_n)}\\right|_{\\mathrm{fields , sources}=0}&=&-\\left.\\frac{\\delta^n \\left [ \\delta_{\\gamma } \\cdot \\gamma_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{phys } } } } \\right ] } { \\delta \\psi(x_1 ) \\ldots\\delta \\psi(x_n)}\\right|_{\\mathrm{fields , sources}=0 } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one sees thus that the r.h.s .  of the foregoing expression",
    ", corresponding to a 1pi green function with the insertion of the composite operator @xmath133 and with @xmath134 amputated external legs of the type @xmath135 , gives precisely the modification of the relationships among the green functions due to the gribov horizon . to our understanding , the contributions stemming from the r.h.s .  of equation ( [ br ] )",
    "should be correctly taken into account when checking the validity of the slavnov - taylor identities or when invoking slavnov - taylor related identities in computations when the restriction to the gribov horizon is understood . + it is worth noticing that the breaking term of will certainly vanish if the chain @xmath136 has a ghost number different from @xmath137 . indeed , the action preserves ghost number and the breaking term @xmath111 itself carries a nonvanishing ghost charge of @xmath137 , so that the operator @xmath138 must have ghost number @xmath139 in order to allow for a nonvanishing contribution . + in summary , we emphasize that the broken slavnov - taylor identity does in fact maintain a powerful predictive character .",
    "it allows us to establish relationships among various green functions of the theory in a way which takes into account the presence of the gribov horizon . at the same time , there exist green functions for which the breaking of the slavnov - taylor identity is harmless . in particular , this is the case when considering gauge invariant operators built up with only the gauge fields @xmath140 . for these green functions",
    ", the physical quantum action @xmath127 behaves as it fulfills the unbroken slavnov - taylor identity , namely @xmath141 the gauge invariance of the correlator @xmath142 implies in fact that no useful information can be extracted for it from the slavnov - taylor identities . in a loose way of speaking , @xmath142 lives on its own and is not related to other green functions . to formally prove this",
    ", one should add the operator @xmath143 to the action with a ( brst invariant ) scalar source @xmath144 , the ( broken ) slavnov - taylor identity will remain unchanged .",
    "hence , similarly as in the previous subsection , by performing a legendre transformation to pass to @xmath114 and by acting with @xmath145 on that identity and again setting all sources to zero , it will follow that there is a trivially vanishing breaking term due to ghost charge conservation .",
    "+      certainly , the brst breaking and its consequences on the green functions of the theory deserve further investigation . in this respect",
    "one could attempt to evaluate some gauge invariant correlation function like , for instance , @xmath142 in order to see if , despite the presence of the brst breaking and of a positivity violating gluon propagator , this gauge invariant correlation function might displays a real pole in momentum space . a first hint that something like this might happen , has been given by a tree level computation in @xcite . +",
    "as one can easily figure out , the presence of the brst breaking @xmath133 is related to the lack of unitarity in the gluon sector . to our understanding , this is a manifestation of gluon confinement : unitarity is jeopardized in the gluon sector because gluons are confined .",
    "this is also apparent from the positivity violation exhibited by the gluon propagator , which does not allow for a physical interpretation of the elementary gluon excitations .",
    "one might have the tendency to believe that the existence of the soft breaking @xmath133 of the brst symmetry is a welcome feature , in particular signalling that , in a confining theory , physics in the infrared region is not necessarily definable in the same way as in the deep ultraviolet , where the brst breaking could be neglected and one recovers usual perturbation theory . as we already stated in the beginning of this section , in the ultraviolet , we also recover the usual notion of the brst cohomology @xcite , allowing to prove that the ghost degrees of freedom cancel against 2 unphysical gluon polarizations , leaving over only 2 physical transverse polarizations , endowed with a positive norm . in the confining regime",
    ", it is unknown what the analogue of this scenario might be .",
    "the absence of the brst symmetry in the infrared does not necessarily entail that the theory is not unitary .",
    "certainly , the @xmath146-matrix of the excitations of the physical spectrum has to be unitary .",
    "but as gluons are _ not _ the excitations belonging to the physical spectrum , unitarity is not to be expected in the sector described by the elementary gluon fields .",
    "from this perspective , the question of what the number of physical gluon polarizations might be in the nonperturbative confining infrared sector loses its context .",
    "the breaking term has also the interesting consequence that it allows us to give a simple algebraic proof of the fact that the gribov parameter @xmath22 is a physical parameter of the theory , and that as such it can enter the explicit expression of gauge invariant correlation functions like for instance @xmath147 or the vacuum condensate @xmath148 .",
    "in fact , by taking the derivative of both sides of equation ( [ deltabrst ] ) with respect to @xmath149 one gets , @xmath150 from which , keeping in mind that the brst operator @xmath74 as defined in equation is still nilpotent , it immediately follows that @xmath151 can not be cast in the form of a brst exact variation , namely @xmath152 for some local integrated dimension two quantity @xmath153 . from equation ( [ d21 ] ) it becomes then apparent that the gribov parameter @xmath149 is a physical parameter , as much as the gauge coupling constant @xmath154 , for which a similar equation holds .",
    "furthermore , it is worth underlining that , due to the form of the brst operator @xmath74 , the presence of the soft breaking @xmath133 is , in practice , the unique way to ensure that the gribov parameter indeed is a physical parameter and not an unphysical one , as it would be the case of a gauge parameter entering the gauge fixing term . let us suppose that the part of the action @xmath155 containing the gribov parameter would be left invariant by the brst transformation , namely @xmath156 instead of inducing the breaking term @xmath133 . since @xmath155 depends on the auxiliary fields @xmath157 which constitute a set of brst doublets transforming as : @xmath158 , @xmath159 = 0 .",
    "it can be shown that a brst doublet has always vanishing cohomology , meaning that any invariant quantity , @xmath160 , has necessarily the form of an exact brst cocycle , namely @xmath161 . ]",
    "@xcite , it would follow from equation ( [ d22 ] ) that a local integrated polynomial @xmath162 would exist such that @xmath163 subsequently , taking the derivative of both sides of expression ( [ d23 ] ) with respect to @xmath149 , one would obtain @xmath164 a relation implying that @xmath149 would have the same meaning as an unphysical gauge parameter for any gauge invariant operator @xmath165 . ] . in turn , this would imply that correlation functions of gauge invariant operators would be completely independent from @xmath166 .",
    "we see thus that the presence of the soft breaking term @xmath133 plays an important role , ensuring that @xmath149 is a relevant parameter of the theory .",
    "the same conclusion also holds when the gribov - zwanziger action is supplemented by the brst invariant mass term .",
    "the existence of the breaking @xmath167 thus seems to be an important ingredient to introduce a nonperturbative mass gap in a local and renormalizable way .",
    "+ a question which arises almost naturally is whether it might be possible to modify the brst operator , i.e. @xmath168 , in such a way that the new operator @xmath169 would be still nilpotent , while defining an exact symmetry of the action , @xmath170 .",
    "although we are not going to give a formal proof , we can present a simple argument discarding such a possibility .",
    "we have already observed that the brst transformation defines an exact symmetry of the action when @xmath171 , which corresponds to the physical situation in which the restriction to the gribov region has not been implemented .",
    "hence , it appears that one should search for possible modifications of the brst operator which depends on @xmath172 , namely @xmath173 whereby @xmath174 so as to guarantee a smooth limit when @xmath22 is set to zero .",
    "however , taking into account the fact that @xmath172 has mass dimension one , that all auxiliary fields @xmath175 have dimension one too , and that the brst operator @xmath74 does not alter the dimension of the fields , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 @xcite , as shown in table [ tabel1 ] .",
    "it is apparent that the brst operator @xmath74 does not alter the dimension of the fields . ] , it does not seem possible to introduce extra @xmath22-dependent terms in the brst transformation of the fields @xmath179 while preserving locality , lorentz covariance as well as color group structure .      having clearly seen the explicit loss of the brst symmetry , it would be instructive to point out more precisely where this breaking originates from .",
    "we recall that the brst transformation of the gluon field @xmath180 is in fact constructed from the infinitesimal gauge transformations .",
    "indeed , for an infinitesimal gauge parameter @xmath181 , the corresponding gauge transformation is determined by @xmath182 which can be compared with the brst transformation .",
    "based on this identification , we shall present our argument using infinitesimal gauge transformations .",
    "in particular , we shall establish the following proposition : any infinitesimal gauge transformation of field configurations belonging to the gribov region @xmath5 , necessarily gives rise to configurations which lie _ outside _ of @xmath5 .",
    "we can distinguish 2 cases .",
    "* * the field @xmath180 is not located close to the boundary @xmath183 * + let us consider a gauge configuration @xmath180 which belongs to the gribov region @xmath5 but not close to its boundary @xmath183 ( the horizon ) , thus @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "next , consider the field @xmath186 obtained from @xmath180 through an infinitesimal gauge transformation with parameter @xmath187 , @xmath188 this configuration @xmath186 can not belong to @xmath5 .",
    "suppose the contrary , then @xmath189 would lead to @xmath190 in contradiction with the hypothesis that @xmath180 is not located on the boundary @xmath183 , thus there are no zero modes @xmath187 allowing for to hold .",
    "* * the field @xmath180 is located close to the boundary @xmath183 * + in this case , we can even make a more precise statement .",
    "if @xmath180 lies very close to the boundary @xmath8 , we can decompose it as @xmath191 with @xmath192 , thus @xmath193 lies on the horizon .",
    "the shift @xmath194 is a small ( infinitesimal ) perturbation .",
    "obviously , @xmath195 .",
    "subsequently , we find @xmath196 for the gauge transformed field at lowest order in the infinitesimal quantities @xmath187 and @xmath194 . since @xmath197 and by identifying @xmath187 with the zero mode corresponding to @xmath193 , we find @xmath198 showing that @xmath186 is transverse .",
    "the field @xmath186 also lies very close to the boundary @xmath183 .",
    "however , as it follows from gribov s original statement belonging to the gribov region @xmath5 and located near the boundary @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath199 , there exists an equivalent field @xmath186 , @xmath200 , near the boundary @xmath8 , located , however , on the other side of the horizon , outside of the region @xmath5 . ] @xcite , it is located on the side of the horizon opposite to that of the field @xmath201 , i.e. it lies outside of the gribov region @xmath5 .",
    "we can conclude thus that any infinitesimal transformation of a gauge field configuration which belongs to the gribov region @xmath5 , results in another configuration which lies outside @xmath5 . since the brst transformation of the gluon field",
    "is naturally obtained from the infinitesimal gauge transformations , it is apparent that the breaking of the brst symmetry looks almost as a natural reflection of the previous result .",
    "+ we can also offer a pictorial depiction of what is happening .",
    "we recall that the gribov region @xmath5 is convex , bounded in all directions in field space , that every gauge field has an equivalent representant within @xmath5 , that the origin @xmath202 belongs . ] to @xmath5 @xcite , and that every gauge configuration near the horizon @xmath183 has a copy on the other side of @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "the first 4 quoted properties are important to make @xmath5 a suitable domain of integration in the path integral , i.e. we can restrict the whole space of @xmath180-configurations to @xmath5 as proposed by gribov . however , implementing this restriction in @xmath180-space jeopardizes the brst invariance .",
    "as we have seen , if we move throughout @xmath180 space with a brst transformation ( cfr infinitesimal gauge transformations ) , we must unavoidably cross the horizon @xmath183 .",
    "hence , restricting the fields within the horizon breaks the brst invariance .",
    "the authors of the paper @xcite attempted to interpret the brst breaking as a kind of _ spontaneous _ symmetry breaking .",
    "we shall now re - examine this proposal and conclude that , instead , the brst breaking has to be considered as an _ explicit _ symmetry breaking , where we shall present a few arguments which have not been considered in @xcite .",
    "although this discussion might seem to be only of a rather academic interest , there is nevertheless a big difference between a _ spontaneously _ or _",
    "explicitly _ broken continuous symmetry , since only in the former case a goldstone mode would emerge . for the benefit of the reader , we shall first explain in detail the approach of @xcite .",
    "one starts by adding the following brst exact term to the yang - mills action : @xmath203 with @xmath74 , the same nilpotent brst operator as defined in .",
    "the first term represents the landau gauge fixing , while the second term is a brst exact piece in the fields @xmath204 .",
    "of course , from expression , it follows that @xmath74 defines a symmetry of the action @xmath205 . as a consequence ,",
    "the nilpotent operator @xmath74 allows us to defines two doublets @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "this doublet structure implies that we can exclude these fields from the physical subspace @xcite , which makes @xmath208 equivalent to the ordinary yang mills gauge theory .",
    "next , maggiore and schaden introduced a set of shifted fields , which -translated to our conventions- are given by : @xmath209 all fields @xmath210 have vanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , namely @xmath211 along with these new fields ( @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 ) , one introduces a modified nilpotent brst operator @xmath216 given by : @xmath217 which looks exactly like .",
    "however , we emphasize that by introducing these new fields , the brst operator @xmath216 will give rise to an explicit @xmath86-dependence when acting on the field @xmath218 : @xmath219 furthermore , by taking the vacuum expectation value of both sides of equation , one gets @xmath220 from which the authors of @xcite infer that the brst operator @xmath216 suffers from spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "notice also that gives a vev to a quantity with a free lorentz index .",
    "+ with the introduction of the shifted fields , we can rewrite the action @xmath221 as : @xmath222 the last two terms can be simplified , leading to @xmath223 if we calculate this action explicitly , we recover the original gribov - zwanziger action , without the constant part @xmath224 . for this reason one adds @xmath225 to the action @xmath221 .",
    "doing so , one finds @xmath226 + \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^4 x \\left [ \\overline{\\varphi}^{\\prime ac}_{\\mu } { \\partial}_\\nu d_{\\nu}^{ab } \\varphi^ { \\prime bc}_{\\mu } + \\gamma^2   x_{\\mu }    { \\partial}_\\nu d_{\\nu}^{ab } \\varphi^{\\prime ba}_{\\mu } +   \\overline{\\omega}^{ac}_{\\mu } { \\partial}_{\\nu } \\left(g   f^{akb } d^{kd}_{\\nu } c^d \\varphi^{\\prime bc}_{\\mu }   \\right ) - \\overline{\\omega}^{ac}_{\\mu } { \\partial}_{\\nu } d^{ab}_{\\nu } \\omega^{bc}_{\\mu } \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\     & & + \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^4 x\\left [ -g \\gamma^2 \\overline{\\varphi}^{\\prime ab}_{\\mu } f_{abc } a^c_{\\mu } - g \\gamma^2 \\overline{\\omega}^{ab}_{\\mu } f_{abc } d^{cd}_{\\mu } c^d - 4 \\gamma^4 ( n^2 - 1)\\right]\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we naively assume that we can perform a partial integration , we find after dropping the surface terms , @xmath227 the last expression reveals that one has recovered the gribov - zwanziger action from an exact @xmath216-variation with the addition of an extra term @xmath228 . however , this term is irrelevant as we shall explain now .",
    "assume that we want to compose an arbitrary feynman diagram without any external @xmath229 leg and thereby using the action .",
    "the second term from this action can never contribute to this feynman diagram as it contains an external @xmath229 .",
    "indeed , this leg requires an @xmath187-leg , which in its turn is always accompanied by an @xmath229 leg .",
    "hence , the action is equivalent to the standard gribov - zwanziger action when we exclude the diagrams containing external @xmath229 legs .",
    "+ although at first sight this construction might seem useful , it turns out that a few points have been overlooked .",
    "let us investigate this in more detail .",
    "firstly , we point out that rather delicate assumptions have been made concerning the partial integration . to reveal the obstacle",
    ", we perform once more the partial integration explicitly , @xmath230 normally , one drops the surface terms , as the fields vanish at infinity .",
    "however in this case , as @xmath231 does not vanish at infinity , it is not sure if the surface terms @xmath232 will be zero .",
    "one would have to impose extra conditions on the fields to justify the dropping of the surface terms . on the other hand ,",
    "when we do not perform the partial integration to avoid the surface terms , we are facing an explicit , unwanted @xmath86-dependence in the action , resulting in an explicit breaking of translation invariance . +",
    "another way of looking at the problem consists of performing a partial integration on the second term of the action _ before _ applying the brst variation @xmath216 .",
    "doing so , we find , @xmath233 subsequently , applying the brst variation gives , @xmath234 + \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^4 x \\left[- { \\partial}_\\nu \\overline{\\varphi}^{\\prime ac}_{\\mu }   d_{\\nu}^{ab } \\varphi^{\\prime bc}_{\\mu } - \\gamma^2 \\delta^{\\mu\\nu }    d_{\\nu}^{ab } \\varphi^{\\prime ba}_{\\mu } - \\left ( { \\partial}_{\\nu } \\overline{\\omega}^{ac}_{\\mu } \\right )   g   f^{akb } d^{kd}_{\\nu } c^d \\varphi^{\\prime bc}_{\\mu }   + \\left ( { \\partial}_{\\nu } \\overline{\\omega}^{ac}_{\\mu } \\right )   d^{ab}_{\\nu } \\omega^{bc}_{\\mu } \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\     & & + \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^4 x\\left [ -g \\gamma^2 \\overline{\\varphi}^{\\prime ab}_{\\mu } f_{abc } a^c_{\\mu } - g \\gamma^2 \\overline{\\omega}^{ab}_{\\mu } f_{abc } d^{cd}_{\\mu } c^d - 4 \\gamma^4 ( n^2 - 1)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\     & = & \\eqref{s1eq1 } - g \\gamma^2 f^{abc } \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^4x\\overline{\\omega}_{\\mu}^{ab } d_{\\mu}^{cd } c^d \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , we do not encounter the problem of nonvanishing surface terms .",
    "to recapitulate , if we first let the brst variation act on the action , and then perform a partial integration , we find a different result than performing these two operations the other way around .",
    "this difference is exactly given by the surface term from equation .",
    "this discrepancy arises of course from the explicit @xmath86-dependence introduced in the brst transformation @xmath216 , giving nontrivial contributions .",
    "for example , we introduced a term @xmath235 which might seem to be zero since we are looking at the integral of a complete derivative ( thus usually taken to be a vanishing surface term ) , but when the brst variation is taken first , a nontrivial integrated piece remains .",
    "+ apparently , to find the correct gribov - zwanziger action with the maggiore - schaden argument , there is some kind of a `` hidden working hypothesis '' that is the correct action to start with , and that partial integration is not always allowed .",
    "the fact that there seems to be a kind of `` preferred '' action to start with , is just a signal that there is a problem with the boundary conditions for some of the fields and hence surface terms when integrating .",
    "+ even if one forgets about the previous criticism , a second problem arises . in the gribov - zwanziger approach ,",
    "we recall that the parameter @xmath22 is not free and is determined by the horizon condition .",
    "as it has been explained in section [ gz ] , the solution @xmath171 is excluded . in equation , we found a solution for @xmath42 .",
    "this gave rise to a positive vacuum energy @xmath236 , as one can see from equation , see also @xcite .",
    "however , according to maggiore - schaden argument , at one loop order the stable solution should be that corresponding to @xmath49 @xcite , as , if @xmath171 , the vacuum energy would be vanishing , i.e. @xmath237 , which is energetically favored over a positive vacuum energy .",
    "this delivers a contradiction with the gribov - zwanziger approach , as the restriction to the gribov region requires that @xmath42 , thus giving a positive energy @xmath236 at one loop .",
    "+ to end this section , let us now consider the new operator @xmath238 within the maggiore - schaden approach .",
    "we observe that we obtain an explicit @xmath86-dependence if we rewrite this operator in terms of the new fields , @xmath239 however , this @xmath86-dependence is necessary so that would be invariant under the new brst symmetry @xmath216 , @xmath240 a second option is to introduce the brst @xmath241-exact mass operator @xmath242 which also displays an explicit @xmath86-dependence .",
    "+ finally , let us consider a third and last possible option .",
    "if we would have started with the following mass operator , @xmath243 which does not contain an @xmath86-dependence , this operator is not left invariant by the symmetry @xmath216 . in fact , @xmath244    one sees that with the introduction of the new mass operator , the maggiore - schaden construction will always give rise to an explicit breaking of translation invariance if the brst invariance @xmath241 has to be preserved .",
    "we thus conclude that the maggiore - schaden construction can not be implemented in the presence of the new operator and even without the new mass operator we have collected a few arguments from which the frame of a possible spontaneous symmetry breaking can not be applied to the gribov - zwanziger action .      in this section we shall take a closer look at the kugo - ojima confinement criterion @xcite in relation to the gribov - zwanziger action . in the literature",
    ", it is usually stated that the kugo - ojima confinement criterion is realized when the gribov - zwanziger scenario is realized .",
    "a key ingredient in the criterion is @xmath245 , whereby @xmath246 is the value at zero momentum of a specific green function .",
    "@xmath247 is related to the ghost propagator in the landau gauge according to @xcite @xmath248 from this expression , it is obvious that an infrared enhanced ghost propagator results in @xmath245 , thereby fulfilling the criterion .",
    "let us recall here that the derivation of the kugo - ojima criterion is based on the assumption of an exact brst invariance and is written down in a minkowskian rather than an euclidean space - time .",
    "this has a few repercussions :    * at a nonperturbative level , some care should be taken when passing from euclidean to minkowski space - time .",
    "according to our understanding , it is not clear whether a wick rotation can always be implemented .",
    "e.g. , the gluon propagator can exhibit two complex conjugate poles , so one should be careful of not crossing these poles when the contour is wick rotated .",
    "clearly , there could be potential caveats when considering a more complicated gluon propagator . *",
    "a more crucial shortcoming is the following .",
    "as we have emphasized in the foregoing section , the restriction to the gribov region inevitably leads to a breaking of the brst symmetry which , however , was the very starting point of the kugo - ojima analysis .",
    "in addition , parts of the kugo - ojima study rely on analyzing the charge of the global color current and the expression of a piece of it in terms of the brst symmetry generator . in our opinion , as the gribov - zwanziger action is essentially different from the usual faddeev - popov fixed ( landau gauge ) action due to new fields , extra interactions and especially another symmetry content , the kugo - ojima analysis can not simply be applied to the gribov - zwanziger formalism , although both might superficially seem to be in accordance with each other .",
    "therefore , it seems to us that one can not verify the kugo - ojima criterion ( @xmath249 ) when the restriction to the gribov horizon is taken into account . * the latest lattice data point towards a ghost propagator which is no longer enhanced , so that the condition @xmath249 does not seem to be realized anyhow .",
    "our starting point was the original localized gribov - zwanziger action , @xmath11 , and the observation of the new lattice data , which shows an infrared suppressed , positivity violating gluon propagator , nonvanishing at the origin and a ghost propagator which is no longer enhanced",
    ". however , the propagators corresponding to the original gribov - zwanziger action are not in accordance with these new lattice data .",
    "hence , we have searched for a solution by looking at nonperturbative effects like condensates .",
    "therefore , we have added two extra terms to the gribov - zwanziger action , @xmath250 $ ] . a first intuitive argument why we added the first term , @xmath251 , was the following . in the gribov - zwanziger action ,",
    "@xmath11 , an @xmath252-coupling is already present at the quadratic level . therefore , altering the @xmath253-sector will be translated to the @xmath254-sector , thus modifying the gluon propagator .",
    "secondly , this condensate is already present perturbatively as , at lowest order , we have found @xmath255 with @xmath256 .",
    "this implies that the condensate is nonvanishing for @xmath42 already in the original gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "it was therefore very natural to add this operator to the theory .",
    "the second pure vacuum term , @xmath257 , was added in order to stay within the horizon or equivalently , to keep @xmath258 smaller than 1 when the horizon condition is implemented .",
    "we have fixed @xmath259 by imposing @xmath260 ; this ensures a smooth limit to the original gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "+ the extended gribov - zwanziger action , @xmath261 , has many interesting features . not only is this action renormalizable , it is also remarkable that no new renormalization factors are necessary for the proof of its renormalizability , meaning that only two independent renormalization factors are required . as an extra feature",
    ", we have also shown that @xmath262 , with @xmath263 , is renormalizable . +",
    "another important observation is that the gluon propagator is already modified at tree level .",
    "we have found @xmath264 this type of propagator is in qualitative agreement with the most recent lattice data , which was the starting point of our analysis . in section",
    "iv the gluon propagator at zero momentum was also presented at one loop ( see equation ) , where we switched off the effects related to @xmath265 by setting @xmath266 . by virtue of the novel mass @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath267 at zero momentum . also the one loop ghost propagator is modified . at small momenta",
    "we have obtained , @xmath268 with @xmath269 - \\left ( \\frac{3g^2 n}{128 \\pi } \\right ) \\frac{m^2}{\\lambda^2}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the ghost propagator is clearly no longer enhanced , again in accordance with the most recent lattice data . + up to this point , the mass @xmath16 was put in by hand . however , we have treated @xmath270 as a composite operator coupled to the source @xmath271 . in this way , we have been able to find nonperturbative effects induced by this composite operator without altering the original gribov - zwanziger action , and making the mass @xmath16 dynamical .",
    "we have developed two methods to find such nonperturbative effects .",
    "the first method uses the well known principles of the effective action formalism .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations become intractable . therefore , we have implemented a second method , the variational principle .",
    "intuitively , we have included effects of the mass term without altering the original gribov - zwanziger action by performing a suitable resummation . with the help of this technique , we have found in the @xmath102-scheme that @xmath272 , the one loop correction to @xmath273 is given by , the value reported in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath274 resulting in a non - enhanced ghost propagator . simultaneously , for the one loop gluon propagator at zero momentum , we have found @xmath275 which is nonzero .",
    "the corresponding value for the coupling constant is smaller than 1 , see equation , which is acceptable for a perturbative expansion .",
    "we have also checked the positivity violation of the gluon propagator with the help of the variational technique and again , our results were in nice agreement with lattice results : not only is the shape of the temporal correlator @xmath89 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ ct ] in qualitative agreement , also the value of the point , @xmath90 fm , at which the violation of positivity starts is consistent with the results reported in lattice investigations . using the plots displayed in @xcite which were also obtained in the @xmath276 case , one can extract a rough lattice estimate for the quantities and , @xmath277 @xmath278 we notice that our lowest order approximations and are qualitatively compatible with the current lattice values .",
    "+ to conclude , we would like to emphasize that the original gribov - zwanziger action already breaks the brst symmetry . due to this breaking",
    ", it is in unclear at present how to define the observables of the theory in the nonperturbative infrared region . according to our understanding ,",
    "this breaking can not be interpreted as a spontaneous breaking , according to the proposal of @xcite .",
    "in fact , we have argued that the brst breaking is a natural consequence of introducing the restriction to the gribov region .",
    "in addition , we have underlined that the presence of the brst breaking term in the gribov - zwanziger action provides a consistent way to ensure that the restriction to the gribov region can have physical consequences , i.e. that the gribov parameter @xmath22 enters the expectation value of physical , gauge invariant correlators . in the absence of such a breaking term",
    ", the gribov mass parameter would play the role of an unphysical gauge parameter .",
    "the presence of the breaking is thus a necessary tool within the gribov - zwanziger approach , allowing for the introduction of a nonperturbative mass parameter in a local and renormalizable way .",
    "finally , we have also commented on the kugo - ojima confinement criterion .",
    "since it is fundamentally based on the concept of an exact brst symmetry , it can not be straightforwardly related to the gribov - zwanziger framework due to the breaking .",
    "+ in summary , this paper presented the 4d analysis of the gluon and the ghost propagator within the gribov - zwanziger framework . by comparing these results with recent lattice data ,",
    "we have found a good qualitative agreement .",
    "the ghost and gluon propagator have also been extensively studied on the lattice in 2 and 3 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the 3d and 2d analysis of the extended gribov - zwanziger action , and a comparison with the lattice data , is currently under consideration .",
