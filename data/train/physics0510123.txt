    "optical beams are electromagnetic fields with a well distinguishable mean direction of propagation ( that , from now on , we indicate as @xmath0 axis ) , in the nearness of which the most part of field s energy is contained during propagation . after the publication of the fundamental work due to durnin _",
    "@xcite , issued in 1987 about non - diffracting beams in free - space , there was a certain number of scientifical investigations on optical fields with the structure of beams and which possess , or approximate at least , the diffraction features of the aforesaid beams @xcite-@xcite .",
    "indeed , as an ideal non - diffracting beam is physically unrealizable , because on each plane @xmath1 it carries an infinitive amount of energy , it is possible to obtain diffraction - free like fields only with approximation : these fields are also known as pseudo non - diffracting beams .",
    "examples of that are the well - known gaussian beams , bessel - gauss beams @xcite or other optical fields recently introduced by casting the propagation problem in coordinate systems different of rectangular and circular ones @xcite that share the properties of mantaining a non - diffracting behaviour only inside a limited spatial range named rayleigh distance . in the present work ,",
    "we wish to introduce another class of pseudo non - diffracting realizable beams that we will call lorentz beams ( @xmath2 for short ) as well as their gaussian apodizated version , that , to authors s knowledge , were never been study before today .",
    "if , from a theoretical point of view , the research of new kinds of optical beams is interesting , it is particularly stimulating in the present case because of the physical realizability of the proposed field .",
    "this realizability is not due to a gaussian term , as usually happen for almost all other known optical beams , but from a practical point of view it was shown @xcite- @xcite that certain laser sources produce fields that shows fundamental variations with respect to the canonical gaussian beam .",
    "as well - known gaussian beam is a minimun uncertainty field i.e. it possesses the minimum achievable angular spreading once the spatial extension is fixed ; for certain laser sources , e.g. double heterojunction ( dh ) @xmath3 lasers , which produce highly diverging fields , a gaussian description for the transverse fields fails : in this case it was shown that a lorentzian distribution is a better approximation , as it take into account of the higher angular spreading , being equal the spatial extension @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in next section we introduce the @xmath2 and we study their propagation under fresnel or paraxial approximation .",
    "in particular we give the closed - form expression for these kind of fields on a generical @xmath4 plane .",
    "furthermore , we will make use of a theory group approach to introduce another class of optical beams obtained by multlipying a lorentz beams with a two - dimensional gaussian envelope .",
    "let us suppose we have on a source plane , that we decide to be @xmath5 plane , the following scalar field distribution @xmath6}\\frac{1}{[1+(y / w_y)^2]}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a constant value and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are parameters related to the beam width , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this kind of field is the product of two functions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 variables which have the form of a lorentzian function of parameter @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the lorentzian is a well known bell - shaped curve used principally to describe the spectral lines of simple dinamical systems usually present in physics .",
    "starting from the field in ( [ lb z=0 ] ) we wish to derive the form that such a field acquires during free propagation . to do this , we pass to the fourier domain , calculating the plane waves spectrum on @xmath14 .",
    "we have @xmath15}\\frac{1}{[1+(y / w_y)^2 ] } \\exp(-2i\\pi p x ) \\times \\\\   & \\times & \\exp(-2\\imath\\pi q y ) dx dy ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{a}{w_x w_y}\\int_\\infty\\frac{1}{[1+(x / w_x)^2]}\\exp(-2i\\pi p x)dx \\times \\\\ & \\times & \\int_\\infty\\frac{1}{[1+(y / w_y)^2]}\\exp(-2i\\pi q y)dy \\nonumber \\\\ & = & a\\pi^2 \\exp(-2\\pi|p|w_x)\\exp(-2\\pi|q|w_y)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the complex spectrum , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the conjugated variables to @xmath12 and @xmath13 variables respectively .",
    "once we know the spectrum of plane waves on @xmath14 we can calculate it on a generical @xmath4-plane as follows @xmath19 because it is well known in which fashion a plane wave propagates in free - space .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is a complex variable that must fulfil the relationship @xmath21 and it is imaginary for evanescent waves , in which @xmath22 , and real for homogeneous waves where @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the wavelength . we know that a field is said to be homogeneous when the spectrum @xmath25 is different from zero only inside the circle @xmath26 .      observing the ( [ spettro z=0 ] )",
    "we deduce that if the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are enoughly greater than wavelength @xmath24 , the majority contribution to the field arises from homogeneous waves having the amplitude @xmath25 corrisponding to points , in fourier plane @xmath27 , near to the origin . in this case one",
    "is authorized to do the following expansion @xmath28 by retaining only the first two terms in the series , so that the plane wave spectrum in ( [ spettro z ] ) becomes @xmath29 in which @xmath30 is the wave number .",
    "now , as we know the plane wave spectrum on @xmath0 we can also derive the full form of the field if we are able to inverte the two - dimensional fourier transform @xmath31dpdq \\nonumber \\\\ & = & a\\pi^2\\exp(ikz)\\int_\\infty\\exp(-2\\pi|p|w_x - i\\pi \\lambda z p^2)\\exp(i2\\pi",
    "p ) dp \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\int_\\infty\\exp(-2\\pi|q|w_y - i\\pi \\lambda z q^2)\\exp(i2\\pi q)dq\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is important to note that the role of paraxial approximation was to give a plane wave spectrum @xmath32 factorized in two terms , each one depending only from a single fourier variable , @xmath17 or @xmath18 ; this is a properties that was not fulfilled by the exact spectrum in ( [ spettro z ] ) for the presence of the term @xmath33 . as a consequence of that",
    "also the complex field @xmath34 is in a similar factorized form . to obtain a solution of ( [ campo z ] )",
    "let us focus on the integral @xmath35 it can be written as @xmath36 for the first of two integral in right - hand side we have @xmath37dp=\\frac{\\exp(c)}{a}\\int_b^\\infty\\exp(-s^2)ds \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\exp(c)}{a}[\\int_0^\\infty\\exp(-s^2)ds-\\int_0^b\\exp(-s^2 ) ds ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\sqrt\\pi } { 2}\\frac{\\exp[\\pi(w_x - ix)^2/i \\lambda z]}{\\sqrt{i \\pi \\lambda z}}\\{1-erf[\\pi(w_x - ix)/\\sqrt{i \\pi \\lambda z}]\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the following auxiliaries variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the usual error function @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the other integral appearing in ( [ integrale 1 ] ) can be easily calculated by observing that it is equal to that just derived in ( [ integrale 2 ] ) after having substituted the variable @xmath12 with @xmath41 . on utilizing this result",
    "we finally obtain the full form of the field @xmath42[v_y^+(y , z)+v_y^-(y , z)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43}{\\sqrt{i \\pi \\lambda",
    "z}}\\{1-erf[\\pi(w_r\\pm ir)/\\sqrt{i \\pi \\lambda z}]\\}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 . equation ( [ campo totale ] ) is the principal result of the present work and in next sections we analyse more in detail the propagation features of these beams .",
    "we expect that the field in ( [ campo totale ] ) changes its shape during propagation as a consequence of diffraction .",
    "it is well known , however , that it is possible to define a diffraction - free range , i.e. a linear distance on @xmath0-axis , under which the beam remains essentially unchanged . to do this",
    "we write the beam to values near to the source plane ( @xmath14 ) by taking advantage of the expansion of error function for high values of its argument @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the gamma special function @xcite . on utilizing this expansion",
    "it is easy to verify that ( [ campo totale ] ) reduces to ( [ lb z=0 ] ) .",
    "indeed one obtains , by keeping only the first term @xmath49[v_y^+(y , z)+v_y^-(y , z)]= \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{a\\pi^2}{4}\\lim_{z\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{1}{i\\lambda z}[\\frac{\\gamma(1/2)\\sqrt{i\\lambda z}}{\\sqrt\\pi\\pi(w_x - ix)}+\\frac{\\gamma(1/2)\\sqrt{i\\lambda z}}{\\sqrt\\pi\\pi(w_x+ix ) } ] \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times [ \\frac{\\gamma(1/2)\\sqrt{i\\lambda z}}{\\sqrt\\pi\\pi(w_y - iy)}+\\frac{\\gamma(1/2)\\sqrt{i\\lambda z}}{\\sqrt\\pi\\pi(w_y+iy)}]= \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{a\\pi^2}{4}[\\frac{1}{w_x - ix}+\\frac{1}{w_x+ix}][\\frac{1}{w_y - iy}+\\frac{1}{w_y+iy}]= \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{a}{w_x w_y}\\frac{1}{[1+(x / w_x)^2]}\\frac{1}{[1+(y / w_y)^2]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the identity @xmath50 .",
    "the shape of the field will be practically unchanged as far as the second term in expansion will be negligible respect to the first .",
    "this conducts us to the following condition , @xmath51 where @xmath44 .",
    "equation ( [ condition1 ] ) leads to @xmath52 and finally ( recall that @xmath53 ) we arrive to the evaluation of the diffraction - free range ( or raileigh distance ) for this kind of beams @xmath54 in ( [ condition2 ] ) we have let @xmath55 to simplify the analysis . if one does not make this assumption there will exist two different diffraction - free ranges , one to @xmath12-axis and another to @xmath13-axis . in figure ( [ modulo1 ] )",
    "we report the modulus of field s amplitude evaluated to different distances from the source .",
    "in particular we observe that , for distances sufficiently shorter than @xmath56 the effect of diffraction is neagligible , as expected , while when @xmath57 the diffraction affects the field shape .",
    "so far we have evaluated the paraxial propagation of the beam essentially by using an integral approach .",
    "in fact , once we knew the field on the source plane @xmath58 we were able to obtain it on every plane as dictated by fresnel theory , namely we had @xmath59d\\xi d\\eta\\ ] ] actually we used ( [ fresnel ] ) in fourier space to obtain the plane wave spectrum on @xmath0 and from it , by mean an inverse fourier transformation , we pointed out the field @xmath34 . if we let @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the slowly varying part of @xmath34 , we know that , if @xmath34 fulfils the integral ( [ fresnel ] ) , then @xmath61 fulfils a differential equation , known as paraxial wave equation , that in tridimensional space holds @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the two - dimensional laplace operator in the transverse plane , i.e. @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the partial derivative respect to @xmath0 variable .",
    "this equation has very special properties , and in particular we here are interested to its symmetry features .",
    "in fact there exists a beautiful theory , due to the mathematician sophus lie , that allows to perform an analysis on the symmetry groups associated to a particular differential equation ( or , more in general , to a system of differential equations ) .",
    "essentially , the theory says that there exist some differential transformations which act like operators on system s solutions and that lead to others solutions of the same equation , when applied to an existing and known starting solution .",
    "the theory bases itself upon a certain number of theorems in the context of differential geometry , and we will not enter in details ; however , in appendix we put a proof of the derivation of the symmetry group we utilize in the following ( see , for example , in @xcite for the theory foundations ) .",
    "this theory was used , for example , by wunche @xcite to show that hermite - gauss and laguerre - gauss beams ( with complex argument ) can be generated from the fundamental gaussian beam simply by applying to it the powers of certain differential lie operators . among all the symmetry tranformations associated to ( [ paraxial wave1 ] )",
    "we concentrate upon only one which states that if @xmath61 is a solution of the aforesaid equation also will be the function @xmath66 where @xmath67f(\\frac{x}{1+iz / l},\\frac{y}{1+iz / l},\\frac{z}{1+iz / l})\\ ] ] with @xmath68 and @xmath69 two real parameter .",
    "the property in ( [ lie ] ) was recently proved , utilizing two different approaches , by kiselev @xcite that has utilized a separation variable method and by gutierrez - vega _",
    "@xcite ) , in which the authors obtained the same result by inserting a well - constructed trial function into paraxial wave equation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the way we indicated here is a third different method , a method which possesses the merit to underline which is the foundation of this result , i.e. an hidden symmetry @xcite and which shows that all beams with a gaussian envelope are intimately connected to the paraxial wave equation . as a consequence of ( [ lie ] )",
    "we immediately conclude that also exist the lorentz - gauss beams , namely @xmath70\\times \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & [ v_y^+(\\frac{y}{1+iz",
    "/ l},\\frac{z}{1+iz / l})+v_y^-(\\frac{y}{1+iz / l},\\frac{z}{1+iz / l } ) ] \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\exp[-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{w_0 ^ 2(1+iz / l)}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the shape of this kind of field depends by the choices of the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath69 . in particular if we choice @xmath72 , we obtain a beams that behaves like a lorentz beam near to the @xmath0 axis and like a gaussian beam far from it .",
    "if we put @xmath73 , lorentz - gauss beams ( [ lo gauss ] ) for @xmath74 shows a field shape more defined around @xmath0 axis with respect to the lorentz beams ( [ campo totale ] ) , i.e. on the @xmath75 plane the lb has a wider bell - shaped field function with respect to ( [ lo gauss ] ) .",
    "b ) when @xmath76 c ) when @xmath77 d ) when @xmath78 .",
    "the parameters are choosen as follows : @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "a new kind of tridimensional , rectangularly - symmetric , realizable scalar optical beams has been introduced . on the source plane",
    "these beams are the product of two indipendent lorentz function and the exact analytical expression for the field on a generical plane , under paraxial regime , has been derived .",
    "in particular it is interesting to note that it deals of a rare case in which one is in the presence of physically realizable fields , the propagation of which is known in closed - form , that does not possess a gaussian envelope term .",
    "this kind of field can represent a valid candidate to modelize the shape of fields generated by certain laser sources , as double heterojunction ( dh ) @xmath3 lasers . using a lie group approach we introduced also the solution obtained by modulating the aforesaid beams with a gaussian envelope .",
