    "recently , several papers have focused on the blow - up properties of a cluster of self - attracting particles @xcite .",
    "this concerns in particular the `` isothermal collapse '' @xcite of self - gravitating brownian particles and the `` chemotactic aggregation '' @xcite of bacterial populations in biology .",
    "these systems have a similar mathematical structure and they are described , in a first approximation , by the smoluchowski - poisson system @xcite .",
    "the smoluchowski equation is a particular fokker - planck equation in physical space involving a diffusion due to brownian motion and a drift . in the standard brownian theory developed by einstein ,",
    "the drift is due to an external potential @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we can consider the more complicated situation in which the potential is produced by the particles themselves . if we assume a newtonian type of interaction , we have to couple the smoluchowski equation to the poisson equation .",
    "it can be shown that the smoluchowski - poisson system decreases a lyapunov functional @xmath5 $ ] which can be interpreted as a boltzmann free energy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the type of evolution depends on the value of a dimensionless parameter @xmath3 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the smoluchowski - poisson system evolves to an equilibrium state which minimizes the free energy at fixed mass .",
    "it corresponds to an isothermal distribution of particles similar to isothermal stars and isothermal stellar systems @xcite . on the contrary , for @xmath7",
    ", there is no possible equilibrium state and the system blows up .",
    "this is the case for self - gravitating brownian particles below a critical temperature @xmath8 and for bacterial populations above a critical mass @xmath9 .",
    "it is found that the collapse is self - similar and that it develops a finite time singularity , _",
    "i.e. _ the central density becomes infinite in a finite time @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "then , a dirac peak is formed in the post - collapse regime @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the collapse time @xmath0 depends on the distance to the critical point @xmath4 and that it should diverge as @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , by using heuristic arguments , it is argued in @xcite that @xmath11 .",
    "this scaling is consistent with numerical simulations of the smoluchowski - poisson system .",
    "however , the approach of @xcite is qualitative and does not provide the numerical value of @xmath12 .",
    "after some introductory material presented in section 2 , we develop a systematic procedure in section 3 , inspired from @xcite , which confirms the scaling law @xmath13 and leads to the explicit value of @xmath12 . in section 4 , we study the relaxation time @xmath14 to equilibrium below @xmath15 and show that it diverges like @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is given explicitly . in section 5 , we derive a systematic large time expansion of the density profile exactly at @xmath15 . in particular , we show that the central density approaches its equilibrium value according to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a universal constant which is explicitly computed .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we determine the pulsation period of bounded isothermal spheres described by the euler - jeans equations close to the critical point .",
    "in the overdamped regime , a system of self - gravitating brownian particles is described by the @xmath20 coupled stochastic equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mobility ( @xmath23 is the friction coefficient ) , @xmath24 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath25 is a white noise satisfying @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 refer to the coordinates of space and @xmath29 to the particles .",
    "we define the temperature @xmath30 through the einstein relation @xmath31 .",
    "the particles interact via the potential @xmath32 . in this paper",
    ", @xmath33 is the newtonian binary potential in @xmath34 dimensions . starting from the @xmath20-body fokker - planck equation and using a mean - field approximation @xcite",
    ", we can derive the nonlocal smoluchowski equation @xmath35 where the potential @xmath36 is produced by the density @xmath37 according to the poisson equation @xmath38 the self - gravitating brownian gas has a rigorous canonical thermodynamic structure @xcite .",
    "it can be seen therefore as the canonical counterpart of the usual @xmath20-stars problem governed by newton s equations and possessing a microcanonical structure .    on the other hand , in a biological context , a model of chemotactic aggregation exhibiting blow - up phenomena",
    "is provided by the system of equations @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the concentration of the biological population ( amoebae ) , @xmath42 is the concentration of the substance secreted ( acrasin ) and @xmath43 measures the strength of the chemotactic drift . equations ( [ ge5 ] ) and ( [ ge6 ] ) can be viewed as a simplification of the keller - segel model @xcite .",
    "clearly , the two models are isomorphic provided that we make the identification @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "introducing the mass @xmath47 of the system and the radius @xmath48 of the domain , we can show that the problem depends on the single dimensionless parameter @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "therefore , a large value of @xmath3 corresponds to a small temperature @xmath50 or a large mass @xmath51 .      in the following",
    ", we shall use the gravitational terminology but we stress that our results are equally valid for the biological problem due to the above analogy . by rescaling the physical parameters adequately ,",
    "it is possible to take @xmath52 without restriction .",
    "then , the equations of the problem are @xmath53 with proper boundary conditions in order to impose a vanishing particle flux on the surface of the confining sphere .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to spherically symmetric solutions , the boundary conditions are @xmath54 with this rescaling , the equations only depend on the temperature @xmath50 , or equivalently on the parameter @xmath55 . as mentioned previously ,",

    "the appropriate boundary conditions are @xmath60",
    "we know that the smoluchowski - poisson system blows up for @xmath61 , where @xmath8 is a critical temperature below which there is no equilibrium state @xcite .",
