    "a topological graph @xmath0 is a directed graph such that the vertex set @xmath1 and the edge set @xmath2 are both locally compact hausdorff spaces and the range and source maps @xmath7 satisfy appropriate continuity conditions ( see section [ sec : topologicalgraphs ] ) . a graph can be viewed as a generalization of a dynamical system where the graph @xmath6 is thought of as a partially defined , multi - valued , continuous map @xmath8 given by @xmath9 for every @xmath10 .    in @xcite , katsura constructs a @xmath11-algebra @xmath3 from a topological graph @xmath6 and gives a very detailed analysis of these @xmath11-algebras .",
    "this construction generalizes both discrete graph algebras and homeomorphism @xmath11-algebras . as with discrete graphs , the structure of the graph algebra @xmath3",
    "is closely related to the structure of the underlying graph @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , the ideal structure , @xmath12-theory , simplicity , and pure infiniteness of @xmath3 can all be described in terms of the graph @xmath6 .",
    "there are also generalizations of the cuntz - krieger and gauge invariant uniqueness theorems for topological graphs .",
    "although the class of @xmath11-algebras which are defined by discrete graphs is fairly limited , it seems that many interesting @xmath11-algebras ( especially those in the classification program ) appear as topological graph algebras .",
    "for instance , every crossed product @xmath13 , every uct kirchberg algebra , and every af - algebra appear as topological graph algebras .",
    "in fact , there does not seem to be any known nuclear uct @xmath11-algebras which do not arise as a topological graph algebras , although it seems unlikely that every nuclear uct @xmath11-algebra will have this form .",
    "for instance , in view of theorem [ thm : topgraphsafembedding ] below , it seems plausible that a finite @xmath11-algebra that is not stably finite will not be a topological graph algebra .",
    "we are interested in the finiteness properties of @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , when is @xmath3 af - embeddable , quasidiagonal , stable finite , or finite ? a @xmath11-algebra is called _ quasidiagonal _ if there is a net of completely positive contractive maps @xmath14 where each @xmath15 is a finite dimensional @xmath11-algebra and the @xmath16 are asymptotically isometric and multiplicative ; i.e.  for every @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 it follows from arveson s extension theorem that every af - algebra is quasidiagonal",
    ". subalgebras of quasidiagonal @xmath11-algebras are certainly quasidiagonal and hence every af - embeddable @xmath11-algebra is quasidiagonal .",
    "moreover , it is well known that quasidiagonal @xmath11-algebras are stably finite ( ( * ? ? ? * proposition 7.1.15 ) ) .",
    "the converses are known to be false . in particular , by a result of choi ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) ) , @xmath19 is quasidiagonal ( in fact the @xmath16 may be chosen to be multiplicative ) but @xmath19 is not af - embeddable since it is not exact ( @xcite ) . similarly , if @xmath20 is a non - amenable group , then @xmath21 is not quasidiagonal by a result of rosenberg ( @xcite ) , but it is well known that @xmath21 is stably finite since it has a faithful trace .",
    "blackadar and kirchberg conjectured in @xcite that the converses may be true with some amenability assumptions .",
    "in particular , they conjecture af - embeddability , quasidiagonality , and stable finiteness are equivalent for nuclear @xmath11-algebras . the main result of @xcite verifies this conjecture for graph @xmath11-algebras . also , the following result from pimsner verifies the conjecture for certain crossed products .",

    "our goal in this paper is to prove a version of theorem [ thm : pimsner ] for the @xmath11-algebra @xmath3 generated by a compact topological graph @xmath6 with no sinks ( theorem [ thm : topgraphsafembedding ] ) .",
    "we show that if @xmath3 is finite , then @xmath6 has no sources and every vertex in @xmath6 emits exactly one edge .",
    "in this case , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the space of all infinite paths in @xmath6 and the actions is given by the backward shift on @xmath5 ( theorems [ thm : finiteness ] and [ thm : infinitepathcrossedproduct ] ) .",
    "combining this with theorem [ thm : pimsner ] will give our result .",
    "pimsner s proof that @xmath31 in theorem [ thm : pimsner ] involves decomposing @xmath22 into its orbits ( viewed as discrete spaces ) and representing the elements of @xmath32 as weighted bilateral shifts on the @xmath33 spaces of these orbits .",
    "our techniques are similar but are more involved since a topological graph can be significantly more complicated than a dynamical system . given an infinite path @xmath34 in a topological graph @xmath6 , we define a directed tree @xmath35 which is thought of as the orbit of @xmath34 . in section [ sec : representations ] we modify a construction of katsura to represent @xmath3 on @xmath36 by viewing the elements of @xmath37 as diagonal operators and the elements of @xmath38 as weighted shifts on @xmath36 .",
    "weighted shifts on directed trees were defined and extensively studied in @xcite . in particular , it was shown that the fredholm theory of weighted shifts on directed a tree is closely related to the combinatorial structure of the tree ( see corollary [ cor : surjectiveshift ] ) .",
    "this allows us to relate the finiteness of @xmath3 to the `` combinatorial '' structure of the infinite path space @xmath5 and hence also to the graph @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec : cuntzpimsner ] and [ sec : topologicalgraphs ] we recall the necessary definitions and results about cuntz - pimsner algebras and topological graph algebras . section [ sec : weightedshifts ] contains the necessary results from @xcite on weighted shifts on directed trees . in section",

    ".    we will adopt the following conventions throughout the paper . for graph algebras ,",
    "we follow the conventions in @xcite . in particular , the partial isometries go in the same direction as the edges .",
