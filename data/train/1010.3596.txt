    "is an old geometric problem .",
    "the problem has been attacked using both analytic and probabilistic methods .",
    "early works on this problem ( karp and li @xcite , yau @xcite , hsu @xcite and varopoulos @xcite ) impose lower bounds on the ricci curvature .",
    "in particular , in the last two works , it was shown that if there is a strictly positive function @xmath11 such that the ricci curvature of @xmath0 on the geodesic ball @xmath12 is bounded from below by @xmath13 and @xmath14 then @xmath0 is stochastically complete . in 1986 ,",
    "grigoryan @xcite found the following sufficient condition for stochastic completeness solely in terms of the volume growth function of the manifold : @xmath15    according to ( [ notexplode ] ) , a riemannian manifold @xmath0 is stochastically complete if brownian motion does not escape to infinity ( in the one - point compactification ) in finite time . traditionally in probability theory ( see , e.g. , it and mckean @xcite and shiga and watanabe @xcite ) , one often looks for upper functions for the escape rate of a diffusion process .",
    "the classical khinchin law of iterated logarithm for one - dimensional standard brownian motion is the most celebrated case .",
    "more generally , let @xmath16 be the radial process of brownian motion @xmath17 on @xmath0 .",
    "an increasing function @xmath18 is called an upper rate function if @xmath19 finding an upper rate function is a more refined problem than proving stochastic completeness since the existence of an upper rate function implies stochastic completeness .",
    "various explicit upper rate function for brownian motion on a complete riemannian manifold have been obtained under concrete volume growth assumptions ( see grigoryan @xcite , grigoryan and kelbert @xcite and takeda @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , grigoryan and hsu @xcite showed that the inverse function of the increasing function @xmath20 related to the integral test ( [ itest ] ) for stochastic completeness is essentially an upper rate function for brownian motion on @xmath0 . while this result gives an upper rate function of a very general form , it was proven under the additional geometric assumption that @xmath0 is a cartan ",
    "hadamard manifold , that is , a simply connected , geodesically complete riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to obtain an escape rate function based solely on the volume growth of the underlying manifold .",
    "we introduce the following increasing function : @xmath21 we will show in theorem [ main ] that under the sole assumption that @xmath0 is a complete riemannian manifold , the inverse function of @xmath22 is essentially an upper rate function for brownian motion on @xmath0 .",
    "[ nobetter ] the difference between the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 is that we have introduced an extra term @xmath25 in the latter function .",
    "this addition , resulting from an attempt to remove the extraneous geometric condition , is fully justified on several grounds .",
    "first , the integral test ( [ itest ] ) for stochastic completeness , which can be written as @xmath26 , is equivalent to the condition @xmath27 .",
    "second , our new upper rate function implies all explicit upper rate functions existent in the literature to date ( see corollaries [ oldrates ] and [ newrate ] ) .",
    "third , in general , the radial process of a brownian motion on @xmath0 has the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a standard one - dimensional brownian motion and @xmath30 is a local time on the cut locus @xmath31 of the point @xmath7 ( see hsu @xcite and kendall @xcite ) . in the absence of any further geometric assumptions , we do not expect to obtain an upper rate function ( up to a multiplicative constant ) for the process @xmath32 better than the upper rate function of a standard brownian motion @xmath33 .",
    "this rate function can not be achieved without the presence of the additional term @xmath25 in the function @xmath22 .",
    "our method has two key steps . in the first , we follow hsu @xcite and grigoryan and hsu @xcite and , by using the borel ",
    "cantelli lemma , reduce the problem of seeking an upper rate function to the problem of estimating the small tail probability of the crossing time between two concentric geodesic spheres ( lemma [ usebc ] ) . in the second key step , instead of estimating the small tail probability by using an analytic approach , as in grigoryan and hsu @xcite , under the assumption that the manifold in question is cartan  hadamard , we modify the way the lyons  zheng decomposition for reflecting brownian motion is used in takeda @xcite .",
    "the volume @xmath34 of the geodesic ball @xmath12 appears naturally in this step because the uniform distribution on the ball with respect to the riemannian volume measure is the invariant measure of reflecting brownian motion on @xmath12 .",
    "the additional term mentioned above , @xmath25 , is a consequence of dealing with the brownian motion adapted to the time - reversed filtration in the lyons  zheng decomposition .",
    "let @xmath0 be a geodesically complete riemannian manifold and @xmath35 the path space over @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the canonical coordinate process on the path space @xmath35 over @xmath0 , that is , @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath38 , then we use @xmath39 to denote the law of brownian motion on @xmath0 starting from @xmath7 .",
    "the radial process is @xmath16 , that is , the riemannian distance from @xmath7 to @xmath40 , the position of brownian motion at time @xmath41 .",
    "a nonnegative increasing function @xmath42 is called an upper rate function for brownian motion on @xmath0 if @xmath43    let @xmath44 be a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers , to be chosen later , and define a sequence of stopping times as follows : @xmath45 ( we adopt the convention that @xmath46 . )",
    "each of these is the first time the brownian motion @xmath17 reaches the corresponding geodesic sphere , @xmath47 the difference @xmath48 , if well defined , is the amount of time brownian motion takes to cross from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . the basic idea of grigoryan and hsu @xcite",
    "( see also hsu @xcite ) for controlling the rate of escape of brownian motion is to give a good upper bound for the small tail probability @xmath51 for a suitably chosen sequence @xmath52 of time steps .",
    "if the sum of these probabilities converges , then the borel ",
    "cantelli lemma shows that for sufficiently large @xmath53 , brownian motion @xmath17 has to wait roughly until at least @xmath54 to reach the sphere @xmath50 or , equivalently , @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "this , after some technical manipulations ( see section [ getrate ] ) , will give an upper escape rate function .",
    "we now use the idea of takeda @xcite to estimate the small tail probability @xmath57 by using the lyons ",
    "zheng decomposition @xcite of reflecting brownian motion starting from the uniform distribution on a geodesic ball . for an open set @xmath58 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath59 the law of brownian motion starting from the uniform distribution on @xmath60 , that is , @xmath61 likewise , we use @xmath62 to denote the law of reflecting brownian motion on @xmath60 starting from the same uniform distribution .",
    "let @xmath63 be the geodesic ball of radius @xmath64 centered at @xmath7 .",
    "in order to take advantage of the volume growth condition , we consider the probability @xmath65 instead of @xmath66 .",

    "the price is that we have to deal with a brownian motion not adapted to the original filtration .",

    ". therefore , with probability 1 , there exists @xmath87 such that for all @xmath88 , either @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",

    "if @xmath95 , then , trivially , @xmath96 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath97 and @xmath98 this completes the proof .",
    "we now prove the main estimate for the crossing time @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath67 be the first hitting time of the sphere @xmath50 and @xmath99 .",
    "there then exists a constant @xmath100 such that @xmath101    the event @xmath102 implies the event @xmath103 now , from the decomposition ( [ lyonszheng ] ) , we have @xmath104 since @xmath105 is a stopping time with respect to the natural filtration @xmath106 , the first term on the right - hand side is a brownian motion in time @xmath107 starting from 0 .",
    "this is not so for the second term because @xmath105 is not a stopping time with respect to the filtration @xmath78 of the reversed process .",
    "however , for any @xmath108 such that @xmath109 , taking @xmath110 such that @xmath111 , we see that both @xmath105 and @xmath112 lie in the interval @xmath113 $ ] . from @xmath114",

    "the desired inequality now follows immediately from this and the inequality [ see ( [ bmtorbm ] ) ] @xmath126",
    "in the preceding section , we have found an upper bound for the probability @xmath127 .",
    "we are still free to choose the upper bounds @xmath128 of the crossing times @xmath48 and the radii @xmath64 of the expanding geodesic balls @xmath68 .",

    "the obvious choice is for @xmath128 equal to a small multiple of @xmath130 , as was adopted in grigoryan and hsu @xcite .",
