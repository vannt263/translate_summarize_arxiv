    "at the macroscopic level , the state of a superconductor can be described in terms of a complex - valued order parameter and a real vector potential .",
    "these variables , which determine the superconducting and electromagnetic properties of the system at equilibrium , are found as solutions of the ginzburg ",
    "landau ( gl ) equations of superconductivity .",
    "because they correspond to critical points of the gl energy functional  @xcite , they can , at least in principle , be determined by minimizing a functional . in practice ,",
    "one introduces a time - like variable and computes equilibrium states by integrating the time - dependent ginzburg ",
    "landau ( tdgl ) equations .",
    "the tdgl equations , first formulated by schmid  @xcite and subsequently derived from microscopic principles by gorkov and liashberg  @xcite , are nontrivial generalizations of the ( time - independent ) gl equations , as the time rate of change must be introduced in such a manner that gauge invariance is preserved at all times .",
    "the tdgl equations have been analyzed by several authors ; see , for example , the articles  @xcite and the references cited there .",
    "we are interested , in particular , in vortex solutions of the gl equations .",
    "these are singular solutions , where the phase of the order parameter changes by @xmath0 along any closed contour surrounding a vortex point .",
    "vortices are of critical importance in technological applications of superconductivity .",
    "computing vortex solutions of the gl equations by integrating the tdgl equations to equilibrium has the advantage that the solutions thus found are stable . at the same time , one obtains information about the transient behavior of the system .",
    "integrating the tdgl equations to equilibrium is , however , a time - consuming process requiring considerable computing resources . in simulations of vortex dynamics in superconductors , which were performed on an ibm sp with tens of processors in parallel , using a simple one - step euler integration procedure , we routinely experienced equilibration times on the order of one hundred hours  @xcite .",
    "incremental changes would gradually drive the system to lower energy levels .",
    "these very long equilibration times arise , of course , because we are dealing with large physical systems undergoing a phase transition .",
    "the energy landscape for such systems is a broad , gently undulating plain with many shallow local minima .",
    "it is therefore important to develop efficient integration techniques that remain stable and accurate as the time step increases .    in this article",
    "we present four integration techniques ranging from fully explicit to fully implicit for problems on rectangular domains in two dimensions .",
    "these two - dimensional domains should be viewed as cross sections of three - dimensional systems that are infinite and homogeneous in the direction of the magnetic field , which is orthogonal to the plane of the cross section .",
    "the algorithms are scalable in a multiprocessing environment and generalize to three dimensions .",
    "we evaluate the performance of each algorithm on the same benchmark problem , namely , the equilibration of a vortex configuration in a system consisting of a superconducting core embedded in a blanket of insulating material ( air ) and undergoing a transition from the meissner state to the vortex state under the influence of an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "we determine the maximum allowable time step for stability , the number of time steps needed to reach the equilibrium configuration , and the cpu cost per time step .",
    "different algorithms correspond to different dynamics through state space , so the eventual equilibrium vortex configuration may differ from one algorithm to another . hence , once we have the equilibrium configurations , we need some measure to assess their accuracy . for this purpose",
    "we use three parameters : the number of vortices , the mean intervortex distance ( bond length ) , and the mean bond angle taken over nearest - neighbor pairs of bonds .",
    "when each of these parameters differs less than a specified tolerance , we say that the corresponding vortex configurations are the same .",
    "our investigations show that one can increase the time step by almost two orders of magnitude , without losing stability , by going from the fully explicit to the fully implicit algorithm .",
    "the fully implicit algorithm has a higher cost per time step , but the wall clock time needed to compute the equilibrium solution ( the most important measure for practical purposes ) is still significantly less .",
    "the wall clock time can be reduced further by using a multi - timestepping procedure .    in  [ sec - glm ] , we present the ginzburg  landau model of superconductivity , first in its formulation as a system of partial differential equations , then as a system of ordinary differential equations after the spatial derivatives have been approximated by finite differences . in  [ sec - alg ] , we give four algorithms to integrate the system of ordinary equations : a fully explicit , a semi - implit , an implicit , and a fully implicit algorithm . in  [ sec - eval ] , we present and evaluate the results of the investigation . in  [ sec - alg4 ] , we further evaluate the fully implicit algorithm from the point of view of parallelism and multi - timestepping .",

( iv )  the ( physical ) time to reach equilibrium  that is , @xmath73 , the number of time steps needed to reach equilibrium times the step size  is ( approximately ) the same for all algorithms , namely , 25,000 ( units of @xmath31 ) .",
    "( vi )  the performance of the fully implicit algorithm  iv can be improved further by a multi - timestepping procedure , where the vector potential @xmath2 is updated less frequently than the order parameter @xmath5 .",
