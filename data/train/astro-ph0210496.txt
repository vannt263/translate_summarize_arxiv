    "source 79 in the radio catalog of kesteven ( 1968 ) lies directly in the galactic plane , @xmath3 ne of the galactic center .",
    "it is a moderately large supernova remnant ( snr ) and is sometimes called g33.6 + 0.1 . radio observations ( velusamy , becker & seward 1991 )",
    "show an outer shell , @xmath4 in diameter , which is approximately circular over the sw half of the remnant but with large indentations in the n and e boundaries .",
    "the brightest part of the radio remnant is an interior region with shell - like form .",
    "the southern part of this `` inner shell '' has the highest surface brightness in the remnant .",
    "the distance has been determined by neutral h absorption measurements to be @xmath5 kpc by frail & clifton ( 1989 ) .",
    "the first x - ray detection of kes 79 was made using the einstein observatory ( seaquist & gilmore 1982 ; velusamy , becker & seward 1991 ) and showed amorphous structure with a bright center .",
    "this inspired a rosat observation ( seward & velusamy 1995 ) to search for crab - like structure in the interior .",
    "the results , however , showed no indication of a central pulsar or pulsar - wind nebula .",
    "the southern arc of the inner ring was found to be bright in x - rays and faint emission was observed from the outer shell , particularly close to the eastern indentation . assuming a thermal spectrum , analysis of the rosat data indicated an age of @xmath6 years , an x - ray luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath2 , and an energy release of @xmath8 ergs in the sn explosion .",
    "subsequent observations with asca ( sun & wang 2000 ) showed that the spectrum was indeed thermal with strong lines from mg , si and s. the global spectrum was fit well by a single nei model .",
    "seward & velusamy ( 1995 ) speculated that this remnant might be younger and closer than believed and the result of a type ia supernova .",
    "as evidence they cited : the circular shell , the fact that the absorption was the same as that in the path to w44 ( @xmath9 distant in the plane of the sky and only 3 kpc distant from the sun ) , and the lack of an observable pulsar .",
    "the chandra observation described here shows that this is not the case .",
    "in this paper we report the detection of a point - like source at the center of the remnant , which is likely to be a neutron star created in the sn explosion .",
    "we discuss the spectrum , the apparent absence of any surrounding synchrotron emission , and briefly compare the source with similar objects .",
    "discussion of the snr shell is defered to a subsequent publication .",
    "chandra observed kes 79 on 31 july 2001 .",
    "the observation was undertaken to better determine the shell - like structure and to measure spectra from different regions .",
    "an exposure of 30 ks was obtained and there were no `` flares '' from particle - induced background .",
    "the remnant was centered in the acis - i array and consequently spread over the four , @xmath10 square chips comprising the detector .",
    "the telescope was dithered and images are exposure corrected so the gaps between chips do not appear in the images . because of the cti degradation of the detector ( chandra x - ray center 2001 ) , the spectral resolution is better along the ne and sw edges of the remnant than at the center .",
    "we took this into account using appropriate tasks from the ciao software , version 2.1 , which was used for data analysis .",
    "figure 1 shows the chandra image .",
    "the data have been adaptively smoothed ( with the csmooth algorithm ) and show the bright inner shell of the remnant .",
    "emission from the outer shell is weak and is hard to see ( except in the e indentation ) in this figure .",
    "five unresolved sources are easily seen , including 3 within the shell .",
    "the brightest , by an order of magnitude , is the source at the middle which is the subject of this paper .",
    "the sources are labeled 1 - 5 in figure 1 , and table 1 lists their properties . the may 2002 chandra aspect solution was used . for sources within @xmath11 of the telescope axis the 90% certainty radius in the chandra position is @xmath12 .",
    "positions were compared with the gsc 2.2 catalog ( stsci 2001 ) .",
    "sources 3 ( @xmath13 off - axis ) and 4 ( @xmath14 off - axis ) are probably stars ; the x - ray spectra are soft and the x - ray source positions are @xmath15 and @xmath16 from optical counterparts , which shows the accuracy of the aspect determination for these parts of the field .",
    "hardness ratios are given for eventual comparison with 2 surveys of serendipitous chandra sources , extragalactic ( green et al 2002 ) and galactic ( grindlay et al .",
    "the hardness ratio , hr = h - s / h+s where s is the number of counts from 0.3 to 2.5 kev and h is the number of counts from 2.5 to 8 kev .",
    "there is no counterpart brighter than r magnitude 19 for the central source ( 1 ) or for sources 2 and 5 .",
    "because the spectra of sources 2 and 5 are hard , they are probably background agn .    the radial profile of the central source is consistent with the expected chandra point - spread - function .",
    "any extent is @xmath17 . thinking this likely to be an isolated neutron star , we searched for time variability and pulsations .",
    "the light curve is constant within statistics - @xmath18 fluctuations @xmath19 20% on an hourly basis .",
    "the search for periodicity was limited to periods longer than 6.4 s because the acis instrument , in normal mode , integrates for 3.2 s. an fft analysis showed no coherent power significantly above the noise , giving an upper limit of @xmath20% for pulsed power in this range .        since many young pulsars are embedded in diffuse synchrotron radiation from a surrounding pwn , we searched for such a pwn at high energies . in the range 5 - 8 kev ,",
    "the central source is still visible but diffuse emission is absent , both from the bright inner shell and from the vicinity of the central source . in the range 3 - 5 kev , shown in figure 2 ,",
    "the inner ring is discernable and there is a small feature adjacent to the central source and extending sw .",
    "the spectrum of emission from this sw feature shows mg and si lines , indicating that much of the emission is thermal .",
    "since there are only 300 counts from this feature , model parameters can not be accurately determined from spectral fits . by subtracting",
    "the thermal spectrum observed elsewhere in the remnant we estimate that up to about 1/3 of the emission from this @xmath21 feature could be non - thermal . assuming a power - law spectrum with photon index = 2 ( like the crab nebula ) , the upper limit to the luminosity of a pwn at this location is calculated to be @xmath22 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "this upper limit is about 1/4 the luminosity of the point - like source .",
    "we note that a pwn is usually more luminous than the pulsar itself [ 20:1 for the crab pulsar ( toor & seward 1977 ) , 1.3:1 for the vela pulsar ( helfand et al 2001 ) ]    the spectrum of the central source is shown in figure 3 and table 2 lists the results of spectral fits .",
    "723 counts were extracted from a circle of radius @xmath23 , grouped over 9 acis energy channels , and were restricted to the energy band 0.8 - 4.7 kev .",
    "the sherpa software was used for spectral fitting .",
    "a power - law gives a fit which , although it produces an acceptable @xmath24 = 1.2 , is obviously too weak in the range 2 - 4 kev and too strong in the range 4 - 6 kev .",
    "furthermore , the photon index , @xmath25 , is higher than observed for most cosmic sources and the value for absorption is high .",
    "the asca measured @xmath26 was @xmath27 atoms @xmath28 and spectral fits to the bright thermal emission in our chandra data yield @xmath29 atoms @xmath28 . the central source spectrum is soft , softer than expected from an agn ( @xmath30 ) or from a pwn ( @xmath31)(e.g .",
    "slane et al 2000 ) .",
    "a single blackbody spectrum gives a good fit , shown in figure 3 , but with @xmath26 a bit lower than expected .",
    "it is also not difficult to achieve good fits with 2-component spectra .",
    "the soft component can be either blackbody or power law and is not well constrained .",
    "a power law does not work well as the hard component and , if used as the soft component , only makes a small contribution to the emission .",
    "if we require that @xmath32 atoms @xmath28 , the absorption observed by chandra for the diffuse part of the remnant , then a 2-component spectrum produces a better fit than a single blackbody spectrum but the relative contribution of the soft component is small .",
    "values of parameters are given in table 2 .",
    "chandra spectra of various parts of the diffuse remnant are all thermal .",
    "the mg , si , and s lines detected by asca are prominent and there is not much variation from region to region . these data and their interpretation will be the subject of a second paper ( sun et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "central objects in snrs were well - understood when the only two known were the crab and vela pulsars .",
    "for each of these objects , the pulsar characteristic age , p/2p , and the age of the surrounding remnant are about the same ( 950 years for the crab and @xmath33 years for the vela remnant ) , most of the energy radiated from the vicinity of the pulsar is nonthermal , and spin - down energy is adequate to power all emission from the pulsar and pwn .",
    "now that more objects have been discovered , the situation is complex .",
    "some putative neutron stars within remnants show no sign of non - thermal emission .",
    "there is no pwn , the x - ray spectrum is more blackbody than power law , and no radio or gamma - ray pulsations have been observed .",
    "these have been called `` radio - quiet '' pulsars and/or ccos ( compact central objects ) .",
    "such objects are found in cas a ( murray et al . 2001 ; chakrabarty et al . 2001 ) , pup a ( zavlin et al . 1999 ) , pks 1209 - 51/52 ( zavlin et al . 2000 ; pavlov et al . 2002 ) and g347.3 - 0.5 ( slane et al .",
    "properties of these objects are reviewed by pavlov , sanwal , garmire , and zavlin ( 2002 ) .",
    "the kes 79 source appears to be of this type .",
    "all have luminosities , @xmath0 between @xmath34 and @xmath35 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "there is only one convincing case for pulsed emission ; the central source in pks 1209 - 51/52 has a period of 0.424 s , a sinusoidal pulse shape , and a pulsed fraction of @xmath36% ( zavlin et al .",
    "2000 ; pavlov et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we note that kes 79 was searched for radio pulsations by gorham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) at 430 and 1420 mhz .",
    "no pulsations were observed above a level of 0.7 mjy at 1420 mhz .",
    "( this is rather weak support of the `` radio - quiet '' classification since a large fraction of pulsars discovered in modern surveys , ( e.g. manchester et al 2001 ) have lower fluxes than this limit . )",
    "the x - ray spectra of all these objects are close to blackbody spectra .",
    "the classical blackbody model , however , predicts a temperature which is too high and a surface area which is too small when compared with generally accepted models of neutron stars .",
    "for example , chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have fit the spectrum of the cas a object and find a temperature of 0.49 kev and star radius of 0.52 km ; compared with the 8 - 16 km radius expected .",
    "the radiation source could be a single hot spot on the star surface but this is hard to reconcile with the observed lack of pulsations ( @xmath37 pulsed ) determined by murray et al .",
    ".    a light - element atmosphere will reduce the derived temperature and increase the derived radius .",
    "lloyd , hernquist & heyl ( 2002 ) have calculated emergent spectra and find that the actual temperature , @xmath38 , is always less than the temperature , @xmath39 , derived by fitting a blackbody spectrum to the observed data .",
    "chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that a h atmosphere model applied to the cas a source yields a temperature of 0.26 kev and a radius of 2.2 km .",
    "they conclude that existing surface - radiation models do not explain the cas a object and that accretion models also fail to account for the lack of an optical counterpart .",
    "the more luminous kes 79 object , if a classical blackbody , would require a radius of only 1.0 km to achieve the observed luminosity at the measured temperature of @xmath39 = 0.48 kev .",
    "application of the light atmosphere model of lloyd , hernquist and heyl predicts that @xmath38 is a factor of 1.8 lower than @xmath39 , or 0.27 kev . this lower temperature would increase the required radius to 3.2 km , still short of the 8 - 16 km expected . since the theoretical models used so far have been simple , perhaps adjustments might be made in the model atmosphere to achieve a fit with a standard radius . obviously better models are needed .    among the 5 central compact objects ( ccos )",
    "mentioned , the most luminous is in the largest remnant , g347.3 - 0.5 .",
    "the source in kes 79 is the second most luminous .",
    "kes 79 is about the same size as pks 1209 - 51/52 but in a denser environment , so is probably older .",
    "thus the central source in kes 79 may also be the second oldest specimen of the `` radio - quiet '' isolated pulsar group .",
    "this agrees exactly with the conclusion of pavlov , sandwal , & garmire ( 2002 ) that the older ccos are more luminous .",
    "if these central objects are similar , they are certainly not cooling rapidly and the apparent increase in emitting area with age is a mystery .    certainly , the source in kes 79 is worthy of more study .",
    "it happens to be in a remnant which has a well defined outer shell and , interpreting this as a shock , one can derive information about the sn explosion which produced it .",
    "future work should include sensitive searches for radio and/or x - ray pulsations and , although none is expected , a sensitive search for an optical counterpart ."
