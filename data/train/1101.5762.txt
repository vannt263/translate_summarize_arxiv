    "this measurement is inherently challenging because the trgb region of is very sparsely populated .",
    "@xcite also used the trgb but complemented with observations of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , the red clump ( rc ) , and the overall match of the cmd to model cmds to estimate a distance of @xmath11 mpc .",

    "the main conclusions of the work are summarized in  [ seccon ] . finally , in appendix [ secimf ] , the uniqueness , self - consistency , stability , and statistical significance of the solution are discussed .",
    "the acs observations of were obtained between september 12 and 17 , 2005 .",
    "the f475w and f814w bands were selected as the most efficient combination to trace age differences at old ages , since they provide the smallest relative error in age and metallicity in the main - sequence and sub - giant regions .",
    "total integration times were 15072 s in f475w and 13824 s in f814w .",
    "the observations were organized in 6 visits of 2 orbits each , and each orbit was split into one f475w and one f814w exposure . in the first orbit of each visit , exposure times were 1250 and 1147 s respectively while in the second orbit they were 1262 and 1157 s respectively .",
    "dithers of a few pixels between exposures were introduced to minimize the impact of pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations ( `` hot pixels '' ) in the ccds .",
    "the observed field of is shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the core radius of is 082 and its optical scale length is 078 @xcite , so the 34 @xmath19 34 format of the acs covers a substantial fraction of the stars in .",
    "table [ logobs ] gives a summary of the observations .",
    "we analyzed the images taken directly from the stsci pipeline ( bias , flat - field , and image distortion corrected ) .",
    "two psf - fitting photometry packages , daophot / allframe @xcite and dolphot @xcite , were used independently to obtain the photometry of the resolved stars .",
    "non - stellar objects and stars with discrepant large uncertainties were rejected based on estimations of profile sharpness and goodness of fit .",
    "the final photometric lists contain @xmath20 stars each .",

    "these small differences are typical for obtaining hst photometry with different methods @xcite . in  [ secsfhmethod ]",
    "we discuss a technique which minimizes the already small impact of these differences in the obtained sfhs .",

    "individual stars are plotted in the left panel and density levels are shown in the right panel .",
    "the left axis shows magnitudes in the acs photometric system corrected for extinction .",
    "absolute magnitudes are given on the right axis using the adopted values for the distance modulus ( @xmath23 ) and extinctions ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 mag ) @xcite .",
    "in the left panel , the lines across the bottom show the 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 , and 0.90 completeness levels derived from false star tests ( discussed later in this section ) . finally , in order to highlight the main features of the cmd , three isochrones from the basti stellar evolution library @xcite are also shown in the right panel .",
    "the cmd of shown in figure [ f2 ] reaches @xmath26 mag below the oldest main - sequence turn - off ; these observations are @xmath27 mag fainter than the deepest cmd previously obtained for this galaxy @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the observations with the over - plotted isochrones and the presence of an extended hb indicate that a very old , very low metallicity stellar population is present in the galaxy .",
    "the gap produced in the hb by the rr - lyrae variables is visible as well as a narrow rgb .",
    "the latter is populated by stars all older than 1 - 2 gyr and its narrowness is an indication of a low spread in metallicity .",
    "the rc can be observed at the red end of the hb . a ms with stars younger than 200 myr is clearly apparent .",
    "some blue and red core helium - burning stars might be also present above the rc ( @xmath28 ; @xmath29 ) .",
    "the rgb bump can be also observed at @xmath30 and @xmath31 mag .",
    "this evolutionary feature may be used as indicator of a dominant coeval stellar population homogeneous in metallicity @xcite .",
    "signal - to - noise limitations , detector defects , and stellar crowding can all impact the quality of the photometry of resolved stars with the resulting loss of stars , changes in measured stellar colors and magnitudes , and systematic uncertainties . to characterize these observational effects ,",
    "we have used the standard technique of injecting a list of false stars in the observed images and obtaining their photometry in an identical manner as for the real stars .",
    "these observational effects must be simulated in the stars of the global , synthetic cmd ( scmd ) ( hereafter _ synthetic _ stars ) to be used for the analysis of the sfh ( see below ) .",
    "@xcite provide a detailed description of the procedures we adopt for the characterization and simulation of these observational effects .",
    "for the present case of , @xmath32 false stars were used for the dolphot photometry and @xmath33 were used for the daophot photometry .",
    "the completeness factor , @xmath34 , is defined as the rate of recovered to injected stars as a function of magnitude and color .",
    "figure [ f2 ] , right panel , shows @xmath35 and 0.90 for the dolphot photometry .",
    "results for daophot are similar . at the magnitude level of the oldest ms turn - off stars , @xmath36 , allowing for very strong constraints on the oldest epochs of star formation .",
    "we simulate the observational effects in the stars of the scmd with the routine _ obsersin_. it uses the unrecovered false stars and the differences between the injected ( @xmath37 ) and measured magnitudes ( @xmath38 ) of the recovered stars for the simulation @xcite . since the density of stars ( and thus the amount of crowding ) normally varies substantially across the galaxy s field , spatial information has also been taken into account in the completeness test .",
    "to do so , first the spatial density distribution of observed stars in is measured . for that , a grid of @xmath39 pixel size bins is defined , stars are counted in each bin and the result is smoothed and normalized .",
    "this is used as a density probability distribution to assign positions to each synthetic star .",
    "then , for each synthetic star with magnitude @xmath40 , a list of the false stars with @xmath41 ; @xmath42 is created for each filter , where @xmath43 is the spatial distance between synthetic and false star and @xmath44 and @xmath45 free input searching intervals . if the number of false stars selected in this way , in common to both filters , is @xmath46 , the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are increased in turn until 10 or more false stars are found .",
    "then , one of them is randomly selected from this list .",
    "if that star was unrecovered , the synthetic star is eliminated from the scmd .",
    "if the selected star was recovered and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are its injected and recovered magnitudes in a given filter , then @xmath49 will be the magnitude of the synthetic star with observational effects simulated .",
    "the same is done for both filters .",
    "our analysis of the sfh of and the rest of lcid galaxies is done upon two fundamental requirements : i ) the consistency of the method , in order to obtain sfhs that are readily comparable and ii ) the stability and uniqueness of the solution . to accomplish i ) , we have adopted the same criterion on the selection of input parameters to derive the sfh for all galaxies of the lcid project . for ii ) , we have further developed our method and created new tests and control procedures .",
    "details are given in the following and appendix [ secimf ] .",
    "the iac method to solve the sfh is based in three main codes : ( i ) iac - star @xcite is used for the computation of synthetic stellar populations and cmds ; ( ii ) iac - pop @xcite is the core algorithm for the computation of sfh solutions , and ( iii ) minniac ( introduced in * ? ? ?",
    "* but explained in more detail in this paper ) is a suite of routines created to manage the process of sampling the parameter space , creating input data , and averaging solutions . as a summary , figure [ f3 ] shows a data flow diagram for the sfh computation process .",
    "considering that time and metallicity are the most important variables in the problem ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we define the sfh as an explicit function of both .",
    "we will use two definitions , one in terms of number of formed stars and another in terms of gas mass converted into stars .",
    "formally , @xmath50 is the number of stars formed within the time interval @xmath51 $ ] and within the metallicity interval @xmath52 $ ] , while @xmath53 is the mass converted into stars within the same intervals .",
    "the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the average stellar mass at birth .",
    "both can be identified with the usual definitions of the sfr , but as a function of time and metallicity .",
    "several criteria can be used to grid the cmd .",
    "the simplest is to use a uniform grid and count stars within each box .",
    "however , not all the regions of the cmd and stellar evolutionary phases contain information of the same quality for the purpose of the sfh derivation .",
    "an alternative is to give higher weights to regions with more certain stellar evolutionary phases ( like the main sequence or the sub - giant branch ) , regions which are more heavily populated , or regions in which the photometry is more accurate .",
    "to do so , we have introduced what we call _ bundles _ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure [ f4 ] ) , that is , macro - regions on the cmd that can be subdivided into boxes using different appropriate samplings .",
    "the number and sizes of boxes in each bundle determines the weight of that region in the derived sfh .",
    "this is an efficient and flexible approach for two reasons .",
    "first , it allows a finer sampling in those regions of the cmd where the models are less affected by uncertainties in the input physics .",
    "second , the box size can be increased , and the impact on the solution decreased , in those regions where the small number of observed stars could introduce noise due to small number statistics or where we are less confident in the stellar evolution predictions .",
    "iac - pop provides a solution for the input set of data and parameters .",
    "it can also provide several solutions for the same set by changing the initial random number generator seed .",
    "alternatively , it can deliver several solutions by randomly changing the input data @xmath56 ( the number of stars in the original , ocmd , boxes ) according to a poisson statistics .",
    "however all of these solutions are eventually sensitive to several other input functions and parameters . to better analyze their effects",
    ", we can divide them into four groups .",
    "the first group consists of _ sampling parameters _ ; the main ones are the number and boundaries of parent , pcmds , and the criteria to define the bundles and grid arrays for sampling the cmds .",
    "the second group consists of _ external parameters _ ; these are the photometric zero points , distance modulus , and reddening .",
    "the third group consists of _ model functions _ , which are those functions defining the scmd ; the main ones are the initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath57 , and the function accounting for the frequency and relative mass distribution of binary stars , @xmath58 ( see * ? ?",
    "finally , we have the _ external libraries _ , which consists of stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries .",
    "limiting and measuring the effects of all these parameters in the sfh solution requires several thousand runs of iac - pop using different input sets .",
    "minniac is used to test for the effects of the four groups are treated separately . in general , the solutions obtained with varying _ sampling parameters _ are averaged ; their rms deviation is also a good estimate of the solution internal error . as for the _ external parameters _ and _ model functions _ , the set with the best @xmath59 is usually adopted .",
    "regarding the _ external libraries _ , the solution with the best @xmath59 may be adopted , but all the solutions are usually conserved ; their differences can provide an indication of the external uncertainties associated to such libraries .",
    "minniac ( from _ minn_esota and _ iac _ ) is a suite of routines developed specifically to manage the process of selection of sampling parameters , creating input data sets , and averaging solutions .",
    "more in detail , regarding the parameter selection and data input , minniac is used for two tasks .",
    "first , to divide the scmd in the corresponding pcmd according to the selected age and metallicity bins .",
    "second , to define the bundles and box grids in the cmds and counting stars in them . with this information",
    ", minniac creates the input files for each iac - pop run .",
    "several selections of both simple populations and bundle grids are used within each sfh solution process .",
    "minniac does this task automatically , requiring only the input of bundles and corresponding grid sizes , age and metallicity bin sizes and the steps by which the starting points of the cmd grid as well as age and metallicity bins should be modified from one iac - pop run to another .",
    "a second module of minniac is used to average single solutions found by iac - pop as required .      in this section",
    "we will describe with some details the specific application of the iac method to the case of , detailing the different effects mentioned in ",
    "[ secsfhmethod ] : _ sampling parameters _ , _ external parameters _ , _ model functions _ and _ external libraries_. our choices are summarized in table [ varpar ] . for each item , columns 2 , 3 , and 4 give minimum ( or choice 1 ) , maximum ( or choice 2 ) and the step used ( if relevant ) , respectively . column 5 gives the final adopted value ( if relevant ) .",
    "the sfh of has been derived independently for the dolphot and daophot photometry sets following the same procedure as described below .",
    "using iac - star , several scmds were computed , one with each of the imfs and binarity functions listed in table [ varpar ] .",
    "each scmd was built with @xmath60 stars with a constant star formation rate in the range of age 013.5 gyr and a metallicity range 0.00010.005 .",
    "the latter value has been assumed after a preliminary test with isochrones which showed that stars with metallicity larger than 0.005 do not exist in .",
    "using a large number of synthetic stars in the scmd is important in order to minimize the stochastic effects of the monte carlo simulations used in iac - star ; to have a statistically significant number of stars in each pcmd ( @xmath61 stars ) , and to reduce the uncertainties in the stellar composition of simple populations in the pcmds .",
    "the bundles and one of the grid sets used to bin the cmds are shown in figure.[f4 ] . in total , 72 combinations of imf and binarity ( _ model functions _ ) have been tested . for each of them ,",
    "24 solutions have been obtained by varying the cmd binning and the simple stellar population sampling ( _ sampling parameters _ ) .",
    "the average @xmath62 of these 24 solutions is adopted as the solution for the specific imf and binarity .",
    "these averages have been obtained by using a boxcar of width 1 gyr and step 0.1 gyr for @xmath63 and width @xmath64 and step @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "a @xmath67 is also obtained as the average of the 24 single @xmath68 values .",
    "the average solution with the smallest @xmath67 is assumed as the best one .",
    "the imf and the binary fraction corresponding to this solution are assumed here as the ones best representing our photometry data , although we do not intend to reach any strong conclusions concerning their true values .    to minimize the effects of _ external parameters _",
    "( distance , reddening and photometry zero - point ) , the sfh is derived for different offsets in color and magnitude applied to the ocmd .",
    "the offset giving the minimum @xmath67 is assumed as the best .",
    "these are obtained when the ocmd are shifted by @xmath69f475w@xmath70f814w@xmath71f814w@xmath72=[0.02,0.11]$ ] and @xmath73 $ ] for the dolphot and daophot photometry sets , respectively .",
    "these tests also provide a way to estimate how distance , reddening and zero - point uncertainties translate into the solution of the sfh . defining @xmath74 as the @xmath67 value of the best solution ,",
    "if @xmath75 is its corresponding rms deviation , all the solutions with @xmath76 should be considered valid .",
    "we can assume that the rms deviation of all the corresponding single solutions is a proxy of the error of the adopted solution , @xmath77 .",
    "the former error , @xmath77 , includes the effects of _ sampling _ and _ external parameters_. however , there is one more source of uncertainty that must be taken into account , namely the effect of statistical sampling in the ocmd . to estimate this ,",
    "the solution is again obtained after varying the numbers of stars in the ocmd grid according to a poisson statistic .",
    "this is done 20 times and the rms deviation of the solutions , @xmath78 , is obtained .",
    "the final adopted error is the sum in quadrature @xmath79 .",
    "finally , solutions have been obtained using both the basti @xcite and the @xcite stellar evolutionary libraries ( _ external libraries _ ) . in both cases the bolometric corrections by @xcite were used .",
    "both produced qualitatively similar results and a comparison between them together with the results obtained with other methods is presented in [ comresult ] . for detailed analysis presented in the following sections , for simplicity , we use only the basti stellar evolutionary libraries .",
    "figure [ f5f6 ] shows plots of the sfh of , @xmath55 , as a function of both @xmath63 and @xmath66 derived from the two different photometry sets . @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    "are also shown in the @xmath82 and @xmath83 planes , respectively .",
    "the projection of @xmath55 on the age - metallicity plane shows the amr , including the metallicity dispersion .    in figure [ f7 ]",
    "we show @xmath80 , the amr , and the cumulative mass fraction of , as a function of time with their associated errors .",
    "three vertical dashed lines show the ages of the 10th , 50th , and 95th - percentile of the integral of @xmath80 .",
    "table [ meansolpar ] gives a summary of the integrated and mean quantities for the observed area and estimates for the whole galaxy .",
    "the main features of the sfh of can be observed in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "the bulk of the star formation of occurred at old epochs , with a main peak located @xmath84 gyr ago .",
    "the initial episode of sf lasted until roughly 9 gyr ago .",
    "approximately 85% of the stars were formed in this initial episode . since then",
    ", the star formation rate has been very low and slowly declining until the present .",
    "the sfr at the measured main peak is a factor of 15 larger than the mean sfr between 0 and 9 gyr ago ( because of limited time resolution , this is a lower limit , see  [ secconstraints ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the age at which the rate of the amr starts to increase more steeply matches up with the age at which the sfr decreases to a low level .",
    "this may indicate a scenario in which the stars were formed at a higher rate at old epochs from fresh , low metallicity gas . when the initial episode of star formation was over , the gas reservoir would have been nearly exhausted . as a consequence ,",
    "subsequent star formation would occur at a much lower rate and from an ism including a high fraction of processed gas , hence significantly increasing the metallicity enrichment rate .",
    "it is interesting to test whether the number of sne produced in during its lifetime are sufficient to produce the chemical enrichment we have derived .",
    "focusing on the main episode , @xmath85 m@xmath8 of gas were converted into stars from 13.5 to 8.5 gyr ago . assuming a minimum progenitor mass for core collapse sne of 6.5 m@xmath8 @xcite we obtain a total of @xmath86 sne produced in the old episode .",
    "accounting for stellar mass loss , and assuming a minimum initial mass of 10 m@xmath8 for sne progenitors , then the total number of sne decreases to @xmath87 .",
    "this can be compared to an estimate of the total number of sne necessary to produce the observed chemical enrichment . assuming the solar abundance distribution from @xcite , that only sne ii are involved , and using the iron mass production rate from @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) , we estimate that @xmath2 80 sne ii are enough to produce an increment of metallicity from 0 to 0.0007 , which is the upper value obtained for 8.5 gyr ago .",
    "this estimate was derived assuming the iron mass production of a 13 @xmath88 star ( which may vary by a factor of 23 with different assumptions ) .",
    "although relatively uncertain , our calculation shows that the galaxy needs to retain only roughly 1% of the material released by sne in order to produce the observed metallicity increase .",
    "the same calculation can be made for the chemical evolution from 8.5 gyr ago to the present . in this case , the mass of gas converted into stars is @xmath89 m@xmath8 and the corresponding numbers of sne are @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in this time , the metallicity increases from @xmath92 to a current upper value of @xmath93 , requiring 290 sne .",
    "this is less than 15% of the total , a much larger fraction than calculated for the initial star formation episode .",
    "this implies that a significantly larger fraction of the newly synthesized material was captured at later times at lower sfrs .",
    "note that only sne ii have been considered for this estimates ; if sne ia were also included , even lower fractions of captured newly synthesized material would result .",
    "note also , that much of the latter enrichment could be achieved by sne ia from the initial star formation episode .",
    "the sfh shown in figure [ f7 ] corresponds to the observed area , which covers the center and a major fraction of the galaxy .",
    "the total mass of stars created in this area over the lifetime of the galaxy is @xmath94 m@xmath8 .",
    "assuming an exponential density distribution of scale - length 112 pc ( s.  hidalgo et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ", we estimate that the total mass of stars ever formed in is @xmath95 m@xmath8 . adding in the gas mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see  [ secint ] ) , then the total baryonic mass of is @xmath96 m@xmath8 .",
    "these values correspond to the best solution with the adopted imf ( @xmath97 for the interval @xmath98 m@xmath8 ; @xmath99 for the interval @xmath100 m@xmath8 ; see table [ varpar ] ) .",
    "if a salpeter imf with an exponent of 2.35 for the range 0.1 to 100 m@xmath8 is used , then the result would be larger by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "figure [ f8 ] shows the observed cmd , the best - fit cmd , and the corresponding residuals .",
    "the calculated cmd has been built using iac - star with the solution sfh of as input .",
    "residuals are given in units of poisson uncertainties , obtained as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the number of stars in bin @xmath104 of an uniform grid defined on the observed and calculated cmds , respectively .",
    "observational uncertainties as well as the uncertainties inherent to the sfh computation procedure result in a smoothing of the derived sfh and a decrease of the age resolution ( see appendix [ stab ] ) . having a accurate estimate of this age resolution",
    "is fundamental in order to obtain reliable information of the actual properties of the galaxy .",
    "we have calculated the age resolution as a function of time by recovering the sfh of a set of mock stellar populations corresponding to very narrow bursts occurring at different times .",
    "five mock populations have been computed , each one with a single burst at ages of 1 , 4 , 8 , 11.5 , and 13 gyr .",
    "we used iac - star to create the cmds associated with each mock stellar population . for the mock populations at ages of 11.5 and 13 gyr ,",
    "five simulations have been done with different random number seeds in order to better characterize them .",
    "the assumed metallicities and sfrs correspond to those obtained for .",
    "observational uncertainties were simulated in the cmds by using the results of the dolphot completeness tests .",
    "the sfhs of the mock stellar populations were then obtained using the identical procedure as for the real data . in all cases ,",
    "the recovered sfh is well fitted by a gaussian profile with @xmath105 depending on the burst age .",
    "figure [ f9 ] shows the input bursts and the corresponding gaussian profile fits to the solutions , including their peak age and @xmath105 . from these results we estimate an intrinsic age resolution of @xmath106 gyr at the oldest ages which decreases to @xmath107 gyr at an age of 1 gyr",
    "also , a slight shift is observed between the input and solution ages . for the oldest trials , the shift is toward younger ages ( up to @xmath108 gyr for the oldest trial ) and for the youngest trials it is toward older ages ( about 0.2 gyr ) .",
    "it is particularly important to determine the oldest age at which star formation occurred in and the real duration of the first , main star formation episode .",

    "the shifts shown in figure [ f9 ] indicate that the actual star formation peak would have occurred at about 11.7 gyr ago .",

    "also , all three methods find star formation continuing at much lower rates , until the present .",
    "the similar behavior of the three solutions allows us to be confident that our scientific conclusions are independent of the sfh solution method . in particular , the fact that the galaxy has formed most of the stars after the reionization epoch is also confirmed and even reinforced .",
    "figure [ f11 ] also shows effect of using different stellar models by comparing the iac - star / minniac / iac - pop results using two different stellar libraries .",
    "here we see that the sfh derived using the basti stellar evolution library has a slightly faster rise compared to the sfh derived using the @xcite library . however , otherwise , the two are in very good agreement , and the main features of the sfh of are found in both derived models at roughly equivalent levels .",
    "an analysis of the actual resolution provided by the match and cole methods , of the kind of that done for iac - star / minniac / iac - pop in  [ secconstraints ] would be necessary before going deeper in this comparison , which is beyond our objectives here . in the following",

    "note that , in both cases , the slope of the amr increases about @xmath116 gyr ago , after the initial episode of star formation .",
    "the sfhs of both transition type galaxies are similar to those of the two dsphs in the sense that an old , main episode exists and that a sharp drop off in the star formation rate occurred @xmath117 gyr ago . after this",
    ", the transition galaxies , phoenix and , were able to form stars at low , steadily decreasing rates while the dsphs completely stopped their star formation .",
    "@xcite showed that the first , main episode of star formation occurred earlier in tucana than in cetus .",
    "the main episode of star formation has an age comparable to that of cetus and is also clearly younger than that of tucana .",
    "there are significant differences between the amrs of the transition and the dsph galaxies even for @xmath118 gyr .",
    "the metal enrichment from the earliest times up to @xmath117 gyr ago is less than 0.1 dex in and phoenix , while it is more than 0.4 dex in the same period in the dsph galaxies @xcite . in the case of the transition galaxies , more than 80% of the stars",
    "were formed with roughly the same metallicity .",
    "this result is supported by the narrow rgb of as described in  [ secred ] , indicative of a low metallicity spread for the intermediate - to - old age stars .",
    "the differences between the amrs of the transition and dsph galaxies is intriguing .",
    "galaxy mass is the fundamental parameter which is thought to determine a galaxy s ability to retain gas .",
    "this might naively imply that the dsphs were initially more massive systems than the transition galaxies .",
    "however , today , cetus , tucana , , and phoenix all have comparable luminosities .",
    "tidal stripping is thought to be very important in the evolution of dsph galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the comparable present day luminosities , combined with the difference in amrs , could point to significantly larger halo masses for the isolated dsphs which have been lost to tides , or , in other words , a much smaller impact of tides on the evolution of the transition galaxies .",
    "dwarf galaxies are the focus of a major cosmological problem affecting the cdm scenario ; the number of dark matter sub - halos around milky way type galaxies predicted by cdm simulations is an order of magnitude larger than observed @xcite .",
    "several explanations have been proposed to solve this problem but most of them use two main processes that can dramatically affect the formation and evolution of dwarf - sized halos : heating from the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation arising from cosmic reionization and internal supernovae ( sne ) feedback .",
    "both are , in principle , capable of stopping the star formation in a dwarf halo and even to fully remove its gas .",
    "the detailed information about the sfh at early and intermediate ages , such as we have obtained here , may provide fundamental insight into the problem and help to discriminate between the different scenarios proposed so far .",
    "detailed discussions about this complex problem can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others . here we will give a short summary just to place our forthcoming discussion in context .",
    "feedback from sne can suppress star formation or even blow out the gas completely from the smallest systems .",
    "@xcite presented detailed models showing that the mass ejection efficiency is low in galaxies with baryonic mass above @xmath119 m@xmath8 and that only galaxies with baryonic mass below @xmath120 m@xmath8 could have their gas completely blown away almost independently of the sne mechanical luminosity .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , according to the assumptions of @xcite , a baryonic mass of @xmath120 m@xmath8 would correspond to a total mass of @xmath121 m@xmath8 , while a baryonic mass of @xmath119 m@xmath8 would correspond to @xmath122 m@xmath8 .",
    "there is a consensus that uv background heating establishes a characteristic time - dependent minimum mass ( a _ filtering _ mass ) for halos that can accrete gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the uv background will heat the gas in low mass halos , preventing star formation , and eventually photo - evaporate them . as a result , halos not massive enough to have accreted gas before the reionization epoch would fail to do so later , unless they accrete mass faster than the rate at which the filtering mass increases .",
    "the red - shift of the reionization epoch has been estimated from polarization observations of the cmb to be @xmath123 ( wmap 5-year results , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the presence of the gunn - peterson trough in quasars at @xmath124 shows that the universe was not yet fully re - ionized at earlier epochs @xcite .",
    "according to models ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the minimum circular velocity for a dwarf halo to accrete and cool gas in order to produce star formation is @xmath125 kms@xmath9 , which corresponds to a total mass of @xmath126 m@xmath8 .",
    "however , most dwarf galaxies in the local group , including all the milky way satellites and five out of the six of the lcid sample , show circular velocities well below that value",
    ". nevertheless , there are currently several proposed ways to overcome this apparent contradiction . @xcite",
    "has proposed that dsph and the rest of the smallest halos would have been formed during the pre - reionization era .",
    "the processes of photoionization feedback resulted in the suppression of the star formation below an observable level in 90% of them .",
    "this was supported by @xcite , who found that if positive feedback is considered , a fraction of low mass halos ( total mass below @xmath127 m@xmath8 ) would have been able to form stars before the reionization era . the star formation in these galaxies",
    "would have been halted by internal mechanisms , like photo - dissociation of h@xmath128 or sne feedback in advance of the reionization era .",
    "another possibility is that masses of dark matter halos of the dsphs galaxies would be much larger than those measured at the optical limit of the galaxies and larger than the limit required by the reionization scenario @xcite . in these scenarios , dark matter halos of lower masses",
    "would have failed to form stars and remain dark .",
    "alternatively , dark matter halos could have been much larger in the reionization epoch , with total masses above the mass required for star formation , but they lost a large fraction of their mass afterward due to tidal harassment @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that a self - shielding mechanism would be present , protecting the gas in the inner regions or in regions denser than some limit from being heated by the uv background @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been suggested that inhomogeneous reionization can lead to large variations in the masses of halos that survive and produce stars @xcite .    in summary , it is useful to note that the first scenario @xcite and also the last ones @xcite , allow star formation in low mass halos ( total mass below @xmath129 m@xmath8 ) , while the second and third are compatible with star formation in more massive halos only ( total mass above @xmath130 m@xmath8 ) .",
    "additionally , the first scenario would imply that star formation would have been produced before reionization and would have been halted afterward in the smallest galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented a set of high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of isolated dwarf galaxies including the most relevant physical effects , namely metal - dependent cooling , star formation , feedback from type ii and ia sne , and uv background radiation .",
    "their results are very useful for a direct comparison with observations .",
    "they study halos with present day total masses between @xmath131 m@xmath8 and @xmath132 m@xmath8 and reach an interesting set of conclusions that include many of the aforementioned ones .",
    "first , halos that are not massive enough to accrete sufficient gas to form stars before @xmath133 lose their gas subsequently due to uv background heating . in this sense",
    ", reionization sets a lower mass limit of the halo for the star formation .",
    "second , in halos that form stars , feedback is the main process driving the evolution of the galaxy and regulating its star formation .",
    "it alone can blow out all the gas of a dwarf system before @xmath134 , while uv background alone has almost no effect .",
    "however , if feedback has previously made the gas diffuse and reduced its radiative cooling efficiency , then the uv background has a strong effect , producing a sharp cut off in the star formation at the epoch of reionization .",
    "finally , self - shielding is effective only in the inner regions of the halos at the more massive end .",
    "all the aforementioned mechanisms are founded on solid and extensive theoretical modeling .",
    "however to decide to what extent one or another should be preferred , detailed observational evidence is necessary .",
    "one such observable is whether the star formation in the smallest galaxies was halted at reionization . to answer this question ,",
    "a precision of @xmath135 gyr is required in the determination of the sfh at @xmath136 gyr ago @xcite , which is indeed what we have reached in our work . in the following",
    "we will discuss the different possibilities in light of our results for paying attention first to sne feedback effects and second to uv background effects .",
    "the sfh obtained for allows us to make a direct estimate of the importance of feedback in . to do so",
    ", the mechanical luminosity of the sne produced in the main star formation episode and the mass of the galaxy can be compared with the results of @xcite .",
    "they used models to calculate the conditions for blow - away , partial mass loss , and no mass loss of dwarf galaxies as a function of the baryonic mass of the galaxy and the mechanical luminosity , @xmath137 , of the sne produced during a central , instantaneous star formation episode .",
    "the kinetic energy released to the interstellar medium by the sne produced in the old , main star formation episode in , can be computed as follows . for a continuous star formation rate of 1 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9",

    "this is the equilibrium value reached after a few tens of million years from the first star formation .",
    "the star formation rate is for a mass range 1 to 100 m@xmath8 and is computed using a classical imf with exponent @xmath139 . for direct comparison , we convert this rate to the same stellar mass interval and imf that we have used and obtain 1.7 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 . scaling these values to the sfr obtained for",
    ", the total mass converted into stars in the initial episode is @xmath85 m@xmath8 . assuming a gaussian profile of @xmath140 gyr , or a duration ( fwhm ) of 1.4 gyr , results in an average sfr of @xmath141 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 .",
    "scaling starburst99 models to this average sfr results in a mechanical luminosity of @xmath10 erg s@xmath9 .",

    "however , equation 1 from @xcite gives a relation between the baryonic and dark matter mass of dwarfs which is an extrapolation to low mass galaxies of the relation derived by @xcite for more massive galaxies ( total masses above @xmath145 m@xmath8 ) .",

    "modern stellar evolution models have addressed many of the shortcomings in earlier generations of models ( e.g. , see discussion in * ? ? ?",

    "as argued in @xcite , the strongest constraints come from relative ages . because all of the lcid galaxies were observed and analyzed in an identical manner we can make the following argument . since we find an age difference of @xmath156 gyr between the peak of star formation in and that of tucana , and since that difference is larger than the difference between the age of the universe and the epoch of reionization , it is highly unlikely that a significant fraction of the stars in have been formed before the epoch of reionization .",
    "an identical conclusion was found for the cetus dsph @xcite . in summary ,",

    "when a mock population is computed according to a given sfh and analyzed in an identical manner as real data , the resulting sfh should be equal to the input one , within errors and resolution limits .",
    "such tests have been executed in @xcite and repeated here using the best fit sfh given in fig .",

    "see also tests presented in  [ secconstraints ] .    to minimize the dependency of the test results on the associated statistical fluctuations inherent to the method ( present in the observational uncertainties simulation and in the synthetic cmd modeling ) , we have obtained the sfhs for 10 cmds calculated from the sfh of figure [ f5f6 ] changing only the random number generation seed .",

    "the main conclusion of the self - consistency test is that the sfh recovering process introduces no significant bias in the location of the main peak nor in the amr , and that the sfh features are properly recovered , although it introduces some degree of degradation in time resolution .",
    "this has to be taken into account and corrected for when quantities like the maximum intensity of a burst or its duration are relevant ( see  [ secconstraints ] ) .",
    "stability is related to uniqueness , but the question we want to address here is what is the maximum excursion of the model functions and external parameters producing a sfh within the error bars of the solution .",

    "since the number of real stars is limited , the observational sampling could be insufficient and could introduce undesirable biases in the solution . to check this point",
    "we have obtained the sfh of five different random subsets of the observed stars .",
    "each one contains 50% of the total , so that each star may have been included in several subsamples .",
