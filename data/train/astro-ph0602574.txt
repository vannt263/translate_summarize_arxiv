    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , characterized by no @xmath1 but strong si lines in the spectra at the maximum brightness , are brighter than most of sne classified into the other types and exhibit uniform light curves .",
    "thus they are used as a standard candle to measure distances to remote galaxies .",
    "a plausible explosion model for sne ia is the accreting white dwarf ( wd ) model , in which a white dwarf in a binary system accretes material from the companion star , increases its mass , usually up to the chandrasekhar mass limit ( @xmath2 ) , and then explodes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". there have been significant progresses in the accreting wd model since @xcite introduced the stellar wind from the wd while it accretes materials from the companion .",
    "their model succeeded in sustaining a stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of sne ia . according to their model",
    ", there are two main evolutionary paths leading to sne ia , the super soft x - ray source ( sss ) channel and the symbiotic channel @xcite .",
    "accordingly their model predicts which companion stars lead to sne ia .    the above evolutionary scenario for sne ia has not been confirmed by observations , which will require the identification of the companion star that should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site .",
    "@xcite argued that their group identified a g2iv star as the companion of tycho brahe s supernova remnant ( snr ) by measuring the velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the center of the snr .",
    "they concluded that this g2iv star was moving much faster than the other neighbor stars and that the distance to this star seemed consistent with the distance to tycho s snr .",
    "although @xcite has argued that the observed velocity of tycho g might correspond to the velocity of stars belonging to the thick disk population , the expected stellar mass in thick disk stars within the cone with 2.87 arcsec radius ( which corresponds to the angular distance from the center of tycho s snr to the tycho g star ) , at 3 kpc from earth , is only 2 @xmath3 , which makes the thick disk star alternative very unlikely . for this estimate",
    "we use the density in the vicinity of tycho s snr @xcite .    although the coincidence of the kinematic characteristics of tycho g with its being at the position and distance of the snr appears significant , confirmation by other means would nonetheless be very useful .    in this paper",
    "we propose a direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the sn ejecta .",
    "a hint was dropped by observations for a star called s - m star discovered by @xcite near a type ia snr 1006 .",
    "@xcite proved that the s - m star was not the companion of this supernova by investigating features of fe ii absorption lines in the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum .",
    "very broad wings were observed in both blue and red sides of the absorption lines .",
    "the line width was a few thousand km / s much larger than the thermal velocity of stellar atmosphere , which is thought to be @xmath410 km / s .",
    "the broad wings are likely to be formed by fe ii in the ejecta of snr 1006 ; photons in the blue wing are absorbed by the matter ejected toward us , and those in the red wing away from us .",
    "thus it was proved that the s - m star is located behind the snr 1006 ejecta .    when a star is inside the ejecta of sne ia , photons emitted from the star are absorbed only by the ejecta moving toward us .",
    "hence the broad wing must be present only in the blue side .",
    "the absorption line with only blue wing enables us to identify companion stars of sne ia .",
    "@xcite used the uv range to observe the s - m star with the faint object spectrograph on the hubble space telescope .",
    "however , in addition to difficulties in uv observations from the ground , companion stars on the evolutionary paths suggested by the above mentioned scenario @xcite may not be bright in the uv range",
    ". then we will focus on absorption lines in the visible range .",
    "furthermore the corresponding transitions need to be from the ground state because most fe ions in the ejecta are expected to be in the ground state .",
    "thus only fe i can produce such absorption lines in sne ia ejecta .    in this paper , we estimate the amount of fe i in the ejecta of tycho s snr by taking account of collisional processes in non - equilibrium and ionizations by photons emitted from the shocked ejecta , and calculate spectra of a star located at the center of a snr and discuss whether we can identify the feature of fe i absorption lines in the spectrum of the companion star .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tbl : ew ]    even when we find a star that exhibits the absorption feature discussed in this paper , there is a chance that a star other than the companion star happens to be inside the ejecta .",
    "a star existing in the vicinity of a sn ia gets a fraction of the explosion energy and is accelerated .",
    "if the companion star similar to tycho g star with the mass of @xmath5 1.2 @xmath6 and the radius of @xmath7 2 @xmath8 is located at the distance of @xmath9 5.5 @xmath8 from the progenitor , the size of the roche lobe is comparable to the size of the companion .",
    "thus the star in this situation will get the maximum velocity after the explosion .",
    "then the orbital velocity before the explosion is @xmath10 km / s . in a 3-d hydrodynamical simulation of sne ia by @xcite",
    ", they obtain a plausible kick velocity @xmath11 km / s . therefore , including the orbital velocity , the velocity of the companion star becomes @xmath12 km / s . if the companion star has been moving away from the explosion site at that speed , the companion star is now at the distance of @xmath130.08 pc from the center .",
    "the stellar mass density in the neighborhood of tycho s snr estimated from a model of the galaxy @xcite is less than 0.03 @xmath14 .",
    "thus the expected stellar mass inside this volume is only @xmath15 .",
    "therefore if we find a star showing absorption lines with broad blue wings in the spectrum , it is likely that the star is the companion star .",
    "as a consequence , we have demonstrated that there exhibit very deep absorption lines with unique shapes in the spectrum of the companion star located at the center of a young snr such as tycho s snr .",
    "there are , however , a few factors that might reduce or even erase these distinct absorption features .    first , the number of fe i in the freely expanding ejecta is very sensitive to the number of ionizing photons emitted from the shocked ejecta .",
    "an increase in the number of ionizing photons by a few factors might decrease the number of fe i by a few orders of magnitude or more .",
    "since the main source of ionizing photons is o in the outer ejecta , the distributions of o and density in the outer ejecta need to be known precisely .",
    "unfortunately , these regions in w7 have some problems to reproduce the observed optical spectra ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . due to this uncertainty in the explosion model ,",
    "it is not conclusive if the companion star of tycho s sn will exhibit unique fe i absorption features discussed in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , it is true that every sn ia has a period during which the companion star has the distinct absorption features discussed above because the ejecta become cool enough to have plenty of fe i for a time after the optical brightening .",
    "second , it is assumed in our calculations that ions in the shocked region are ionized to fe@xmath16 , si@xmath17 , o@xmath18 , c@xmath19 immediately after the shock passes following the procedure taken by @xcite .",
    "since ions in lower ionization stages are a strong source of ionizing photons , ionization may be more advanced in real young snrs .",
