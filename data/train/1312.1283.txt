    "one of the most influential random matrix theory ( rmt ) developments of the last decade was discovery in 2002 of the so - called tridiagonal @xmath0-ensembles by dumitriu and edelman in @xcite .",
    "the tridiagonal random matrices of this ensemble have explicit and independent ( up to symmetry ) entries and their eigenvalues are distributed according to the equilibrium joint probability density function ( jpdf ) of charged particles in a one dimensional coulomb gas with electrostatic repulsion , confined in a quadratic potential and subject to a thermal noise at temperature @xmath8 for _ arbitrary _ @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , the jpdf of the eigenvalues is given by @xmath10 for @xmath11 ( respectively @xmath12 ) , this jpdf arises as the joint law of the eigenvalues of the classical gaussian orthogonal ( respectively unitary , symplectic ) ensembles , whose linear eigenvalues statistics were extensively studied in the literature ( see @xcite for a review of rmt and its applications ) .    the introduction of the tridiagonal random matrices for _ arbitrary _",
    "@xmath0-ensembles has led to considerable progress for the study of linear statistics of the point process with jpdf @xmath13 .",
    "they have permitted to prove that the largest eigenvalues converge jointly in distribution to the low - lying eigenvalues of the random schrodinger operator , also called _ stochastic airy operator _ , @xmath14 , restricted to the positive half - line , where @xmath15 is a white noise on @xmath16 @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review on the top eigenvalue statistics of random matrices ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we are interested in the limiting marginal distributions of the bottom eigenvalues of the stochastic airy operator when the parameter @xmath0 tends to @xmath1 .",
    "as mentioned above , the stochastic airy operator appears as the continuous scaling limit of @xmath0-ensembles at the edge of the spectrum and we shall see that the question we investigate is in fact related to the largest eigenvalues statistics of @xmath0-ensembles when the @xmath0 index scales with the dimension @xmath17 such that @xmath18 when @xmath6 .",
    "a somehow related question was investigated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where the authors consider the empirical eigenvalues density of @xmath0-ensembles in the limit of large dimension @xmath17 and with @xmath19 .",
    "the limiting family of probability density @xmath20 is computed explicitly in terms of parabolic cylinder functions and is proved to interpolate continuously between the gaussian shape ( obtained for @xmath21 ) and the wigner semicircle shape ( which is recovered when @xmath22 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-wishart ensemble was handled similarly in @xcite .",
    "the question of the characterization of an interpolation between the tracy - widom @xmath0 distribution ( which governs the typical fluctuations of the top eigenvalue as @xmath23 with @xmath9 fixed ) and the gumbel distribution ( which governs the typical fluctuations of the maximum of independent gaussian variables  corresponding to the @xmath24 case ) was raised in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we answer this question proving that the tracy - widom @xmath0 distribution converges weakly ( when properly rescaled and centered ) to the gumbel distribution when @xmath0 goes to @xmath1 .",
    "this is the content of theorem [ tracywidom.gumbel ] .",
    "we use the characterization of the marginal distributions of the low lying eigenvalues of the stochastic airy operator in terms of the explosion times process of the associated riccati diffusion @xcite .",
    "we show that the empirical measure of the explosion times converges weakly in the space of radon measures to an inhomogeneous poisson point process on @xmath16 with explicit intensity . the weak convergence of all the marginal distributions of the second , third , etc eigenvalues can be readily deduced .",
    "although we expect the minimal eigenvalues to have poissonian statistics in the small @xmath0 limit , the convergences of the joint distribution of the @xmath2 bottom eigenvalues for any fixed index @xmath2 seem to be difficult to prove as there is not a simple characterization of this law in terms of a single diffusion .",
    "it is still characterized in this setting in terms of a family of coupled diffusions but the interaction between those diffusions is complex and makes the analysis difficult ( see figures [ explosion1 ] and [ couplage_diffusions ] below ) .    as an application ,",
    "we investigate ( with heuristic and numerical arguments ) the weak convergence of the top eigenvalue of @xmath4-ensembles in the double scaling limit @xmath6 and @xmath5 . we revisit the ideas of @xcite which proposes that tridiagonal random matrices of @xmath0-ensembles",
    "are properly viewed as finite difference schemes of the stochastic airy operator . from our heuristic discussion in section [ rmt ] , this relation seems to remain valid also in the regime @xmath5 and permits to establish the weak convergence of the top eigenvalue of @xmath4 ensembles to the gumbel distribution , for any sequence @xmath4 such that @xmath25 we explicit the scaling and centering of this convergence which are in fact the same as in the convergence of the tracy - widom @xmath0 distribution to the gumbel distribution .",
    "again , the allied results on the second , third , fourth , etc eigenvalues can also be derived from our former results on the stochastic airy ensemble ( @xmath26 for short ) .",
    "we finally mention that our derivation does not cover the case where @xmath27 , which is highly interesting as the interpolation for the empirical spectral distribution occurs on this range of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath4 decreasing as slowly as @xmath28 or even more slowly , the typical fluctuations of the top eigenvalues seem to enter the gumbel regime in the sense that the centerings and scalings are found to be the same as in the classical setting of independent gaussian variables .    to facilitate the reading , let us draw up a short outline of the paper . in section [ sae.review ] , we give a brief review on stochastic airy ensemble ( @xmath29 for short ) , recalling in particular the correspondence between the law of the eigenvalues and the law of the explosion times process of the associated riccati diffusion established by @xcite .    in section [ exit.time.statio ]",

    "we provide a simple characterization of the law of the exit time which permits to prove its weak convergence to an exponential distribution , when the trap gets very deep in comparison to the noise .",
    "then we consider the explosion times process of the stationary riccati diffusion and we prove that it converges to a ( homogeneous ) poisson point process .",

    "this is straightforwardly deduced from the convergence of the explosion time process of the diffusion .",
    "the convergences of the marginal distributions of the other neighboring minimal eigenvalues can be deduced as well .",

    "the increasing property is rather intuitive and can be enunciated as follows : if @xmath60 , then the number of explosions of @xmath61 is stochastically bounded above by the number of explosions of @xmath62 on any compact interval @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "equivalently , the diffusion @xmath62 remains below @xmath61 until its first explosion time and can not cross the trajectory of @xmath55 from below to above .",
    "intuitively this property is rather obvious since the drift of @xmath62 pulls stronger downside than the one of @xmath61 .",
    "note however that the comparison theorem for sdes ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.18 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem ( 3.7 ) , chapter ix ) ) does not apply directly ( the drifts are not lipschitz ) and one needs to use a localization argument before applying it .",
    "now we explain the key relation .",
    "first , we will look at the operator @xmath64 defined on the set of functions with support in the truncated interval @xmath65 $ ] with dirichlet boundary conditions at both endpoints .",
    "this truncated operator is shown to approximate closely the operator @xmath32 when @xmath66 in a precise topology @xcite . at",
    "fixed @xmath67 , the definitions of the eigenfunctions and their associated riccati transform imply that @xmath68 is an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath64 _ if and only if _ the riccati diffusion @xmath61 explodes precisely at the end point @xmath67 .",
    "we can deduce that the number of eigenvalues of the operator @xmath64 smaller than @xmath57 equals the number of real numbers @xmath69 such that @xmath70 blows up exactly in @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath71 slowly decreases from @xmath57 to @xmath54 , we can see from the _ increasing property _ and the continuity of the whole trajectory @xmath72 with respect to @xmath71 that the explosion waiting times of @xmath62 will simultaneously get longer and longer to finally diverge to @xmath56 when @xmath71 gets too small for the diffusion to explode in @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ explosion1 ] and [ couplage_diffusions ] ) .",
    "in particular , any explosion of @xmath61 which occurs before time @xmath67 will slowly translate continuously to occur at some point exactly in @xmath67 for some @xmath62 with @xmath73 .",
    "thus the number of eigenvalues of @xmath64 smaller than @xmath57 is equal to the number of explosions of @xmath55 on the interval @xmath74 $ ] .",
