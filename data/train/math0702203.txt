    "<S> we present a new viewpoint ( namely , reproducing kernels ) and new proofs for several recent results of j. geronimo and h. woerdeman on orthogonal polynomials on the two dimensional torus ( and related subjects ) . </S>",

    "<S> a simple necessary and sufficient condition for two variable polynomial stability is also given .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction    prelude    in several recent papers , j. geronimo and h. woerdeman have presented a number of important generalizations of classical theorems revolving around such topics as orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle , fejr - riesz factorization , and autoregressive filter design to the context of two variables ; namely , generalizations to the two dimensional torus or just the _ 2-torus _ @xmath0 ( also known as the distinguished boundary of the bidisk @xmath1 ) . see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the goals of this paper is to present and prove many of their results from a different viewpoint so that a larger audience may appreciate what they have done . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that one of their formulas actually gives a new proof of and s inequality via an equivalent version proven by b. cole and j. wermer . </S>",
    "<S> this may sound quite specialized ; however , the results in this paper have consequences that anyone can appreciate . </S>",
    "<S> let us whet the reader s appetite with the following interesting by - product of our work ( which will also serve to introduce the terms _ degree _ </S>",

    "<S> [ stablethm ] let @xmath3 be a polynomial in two complex variables of _ degree _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath4 and define the _ reflection _ @xmath5 of @xmath3 to be @xmath6    the polynomial @xmath3 has no zeros in the closed bidisk @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath3 is _ stable _ ) if and only if there exists a @xmath8 such that @xmath9    see section [ sec : con ] for a proof . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of this theorem is that it says when a polynomial has no zeros on the _ boundary _ of the bidisk . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> this says something very specific about two variables : the analogue of this theorem in three variables is ( probably ) not true , but , while the analogue of this theorem in one variable _ is _ true , the condition can be weakened to remove the term @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> a key to notations and conventions all of the following notations will be introduced throughout the paper , but we collect them here for the benefit of the reader .    </S>",
    "<S> notations / definitions : @xmath11    these last two somewhat strange looking notations will make more sense later . </S>",
    "<S> many other important notations are defined in section [ sec : note ] but we do not present them here .    </S>",

    "<S> fix positive integers @xmath21 throughout the paper , and define the complex polynomials of degree @xmath2 @xmath22    the following nondegeneracy condition will often be imposed on @xmath14 :    [ ass ] the measure @xmath14 is said to be _ nondegenerate _ ( at the @xmath2 level ) if a polynomial @xmath23 can have norm @xmath24 only if @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> this is just another way of saying that the toeplitz moment matrix for @xmath14 corresponding to the product index set @xmath26 is positive definite .    in order to introduce one of geronimo and woerdeman s main theorems from @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> let us present a classical one - variable theorem found in @xcite ( page 95 ) for instance .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath27 be a nontrivial probability measure on @xmath28 and let @xmath29 be the polynomial ( in one complex variable @xmath30 ) of degree @xmath31 satisfying @xmath32 then , @xmath29 has no zeros in the closed disk @xmath33 and the measure on @xmath34 @xmath35 defines the same inner product on polynomials of degree less than or equal to @xmath31 as @xmath27 .    in @xcite , geronimo and woerdeman </S>",
    "<S> prove when a measure on @xmath13 behaves similarly to a measure on @xmath34 as in the above theorem . </S>",
    "<S> here is an equivalent formulation of their theorem on this matter .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : ger - woe ] suppose @xmath14 is nondegenerate ( as in definition [ ass ] ) and consider the polynomial @xmath36 defined by the conditions @xmath37 then , @xmath29 is stable ( i.e. has no zeros in the closed bidisk @xmath7 ) and the measure on @xmath13 @xmath38 defines the same inner product on @xmath39 as @xmath14 if and only if @xmath14 satisfies the following `` automatic orthogonality condition '' : every polynomial @xmath3 in the span of @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 automatically satisfies @xmath42    in section [ sec : note ] we shall introduce a new notation and in sections [ sec : kernel ] and [ sec : bs ] we present several results which we believe provide insight into this somewhat technical sounding , yet important , theorem . before that , we turn to an interesting connection between this work , interpolation for bounded analytic functions on the bidisk , and two - variable operator theory .    </S>",
    "<S> and , agler , and christoffel - darboux an important part of the proof of the geronimo - woerdeman theorem [ thm : ger - woe ] is a `` christoffel - darboux like formula '' for two variables . to set the stage and for later use , let us present the christoffel - darboux formula for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle ( see @xcite theorem 2.2.7 page 124 ) </S>",
    "<S> .    </S>",

    "<S> the two variable formula proven by geronimo - woerdeman has the following flavor . for @xmath29 and @xmath14 as in the conclusion of theorem [ thm : ger - woe ] , there exist polynomials @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 such that @xmath54 where @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> for the moment , we do not need to say what @xmath56 and @xmath57 are ( although we can and will later ) . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out this christoffel - darboux formula is closely related to and s theorem in operator theory and agler s theorem on finite interpolation for bounded analytic functions on the bidisk .    </S>",
    "<S> and s theorem @xcite says given a polynomial @xmath58 in two complex variables and two commuting operators @xmath59 on a hilbert space with norms @xmath60 , the following holds : @xmath61 agler s theorem ( see @xcite page 180 ) says given @xmath62 distinct points @xmath63 ( where we write @xmath64 ) and @xmath62 points @xmath65 , there exists a holomorphic function @xmath66 on @xmath1 with @xmath67 which interpolates @xmath68 if and only if there exist positive semidefinite @xmath69 matrices @xmath70 and @xmath71 so that @xmath72 for @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that both and s theorem and agler s theorem are equivalent to a result about polynomials that looks suspiciously like the geronimo - woerdeman formula .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cwthm ] let @xmath58 and @xmath74 be polynomials in two complex variables satisfying @xmath75 in two variables , @xmath76 , such that we have @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> the conditions and are just another way of saying that @xmath79 is a rational inner function on the bidisk . </S>",
    "<S> rational inner functions on the bidisk have a quite simple form : @xmath74 as above has to equal @xmath80 ( where we have to perform the `` reflection '' at the right degree ) . in section [ sec : ando ] we shall present the simple proof that the geronimo - woerdeman formula actually proves the above theorem . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the approach of geronimo - woerdeman and of this paper actually gives more information about the decomposition in than previous proofs of and s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the decomposition is usually proven with a finite dimensional hahn - banach theorem and as such is not explicit about what @xmath81 and @xmath82 are . </S>",
    "<S> the approach here provides very specific information about @xmath81 and @xmath82 in ( at least in the case where @xmath58 is stable ) .    </S>",
    "<S> notation and theorem rephrasing[sec : note ]    this section is devoted to a new notation which we believe will make many of the earlier results more conceptually clear and easier to digest . </S>",
    "<S> like earlier , we shall fix a nondegenerate probability measure @xmath14 on @xmath13 and corresponding inner product @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath84 be a finite dimensional subspace of two variable polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> for each @xmath85 , evaluation at @xmath86 is a bounded linear functional on @xmath84 ( bounded , of course , because @xmath84 is finite dimensional ) , and can therefore be represented as the inner product against the reproducing kernel for @xmath84 which we denote as @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , if @xmath88 , then @xmath89 . we define @xmath90 without the subscript @xmath86 to be @xmath91 which happens to be a holomorphic polynomial in @xmath92 , an anti - holomorphic polynomial in @xmath93 , and conjugate symmetric in the first and second vectors . </S>",
    "<S> essentially we have defined a map depending on @xmath14 @xmath94 which , as we shall see in section [ sec : kernel ] , turns orthogonal direct sums into sums , vector space shifts into multiplication shifts , and `` reflection '' of subspaces into `` double reflection '' of reproducing kernels .    </S>",
    "<S> the following subspaces will be useful throughout . </S>",
    "<S> once the definitions are digested , the use of these strange symbols will become apparent .    </S>",
    "<S> * let @xmath95 denote the span of @xmath96 * let @xmath97 denote the span of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> * let @xmath99 denote the span of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> * let @xmath101 denote the span of @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> * let @xmath103 denote the span of @xmath104 .    </S>",
    "<S> we hope now the definitions of the subspaces @xmath105 and @xmath106 will be clear . </S>",
    "<S> next , we define many more subspaces in terms of orthogonal complements using the inner product @xmath107 </S>",
    "<S> .    define @xmath108 and again we hope the definitions of many other such symbols will be intuitively clear ( in fact , that is the prime reason for this new notation ) . </S>",
    "<S> when there is more than one measure present , we will add an additional subscript to make it clear which measure we are referring to ; e.g. @xmath109 refers to the subspace defined above using the inner product defined by @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we are looking at a reproducing kernel @xmath110 we will leave off the second @xmath14 and just write @xmath111 .    since the subspace @xmath112 is one dimensional , it is not difficult to see that the corresponding reproducing kernel can be identified with @xmath113 for some unit norm polynomial @xmath29 ( which is unique up to multiplication by a unimodular constant ) .    with all of this notation in place </S>",
    "<S> let us restate the geronimo - woerdeman theorem </S>",
    "<S> .    given a nondegenerate probability measure @xmath14 on @xmath13 , the polynomial @xmath29 defined in is stable and the measure @xmath114 has reproducing kernel @xmath115 equal to @xmath116 if and only if @xmath117    let us now put this new notation to use .    </S>",
    "<S> reproducing kernel calculus[sec : kernel ] there are several advantages to working with various reproducing kernels when studying polynomials with respect to a measure on @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> one advantage is the interface between subspaces and algebraic operations on kernels demonstrated in the following three fundamental propositions . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage is that bergman identity ( below ) provides an interface between orthogonal polynomials and reproducing kernels . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , choices of ordering polynomials and orthogonal bases are avoided and absorbed into reproducing kernels .    </S>",
    "<S> like before we fix a nondegenerate probability measure @xmath14 on @xmath13 and corresponding inner product @xmath83 .    if @xmath118 are finite dimensional subspaces of polynomials , then @xmath84 and @xmath119 are orthogonal if and only if the join of @xmath84 and @xmath119 , denoted @xmath120 , satisfies the following formula for reproducing kernels @xmath121    suppose @xmath84 and @xmath119 are orthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> then , for any @xmath122 , which we may write as @xmath123 for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , we have @xmath126 and therefore , @xmath127 .    for the other direction , first note that the reproducing kernels @xmath128 span @xmath84 , since any polynomial in @xmath84 orthogonal to all reproducing kernels is identically zero . </S>",
    "<S> so , if @xmath129 as reproducing kernels , then @xmath130 implies @xmath131 i.e. @xmath74 is orthogonal to the reproducing kernel for @xmath119 and hence all of @xmath119 .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath132 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath84 be a finite dimensional subspace of two variable polynomials and define @xmath133 and likewise for @xmath134 . then , and the variable @xmath30 in the following formula . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath135 and likewise for @xmath136 .    </S>",
    "<S> observe that for any @xmath130 @xmath137 since multiplication by @xmath30 is a unitary . </S>",
    "<S> so , @xmath138 reproduces a generic element @xmath139 of @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> the claim follows by uniqueness of reproducing kernels .    for example , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath141 and @xmath142 .    </S>",
    "<S> for the third proposition , we recall one definition and introduce another related one .    given any @xmath143 , the _ reflection _ of @xmath58 is another polynomial @xmath144 which is defined by @xmath145    the map @xmath146 is anti - unitary ; i.e. @xmath147 and can be described in concrete terms as the anti - linear map which sends a monomial @xmath148 .    given @xmath149 a holomorphic polynomial in the first two variables of degree @xmath2 and an anti - holomorphic polynomial in the second two variables of degree @xmath2 , the _ </S>",

    "<S> [ refl : prop ] let @xmath84 be a subspace of @xmath39 and define @xmath155 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath156    let @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath158 and by the two above remarks @xmath159 and the claim follows , again by uniqueness .    [ prop : berg ] let @xmath84 be a finite dimensional subspace of two variable polynomials and let @xmath160 be an orthonormal basis for @xmath84 . then , @xmath161    the expression on the right reproduces each orthonormal basis element and hence everything in @xmath84 .    with the fundamental properties of these reproducing kernels out of the way </S>",
    "<S> let us present a formula that holds in complete generality and sheds some light on the geronimo - woerdeman theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath112 is one dimensional , the bergman identity tells us there is a unit norm polynomial @xmath29 , unique up to multiplication by a unimodular constant , such that @xmath162 allow us to abbreviate this as @xmath163 . by proposition [ refl : prop ] above @xmath164 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fundthm ] let @xmath14 be a nondegenerate probability measure on @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> finally , if we note that @xmath172 and @xmath173 the theorem follows from after a little rearrangement .    </S>",
    "<S> this easily yields the following corollary .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cor : ineq ] if @xmath174 , then @xmath175    when @xmath174 , it is also true that @xmath176 by reflection . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , on the diagonal @xmath177 , @xmath178 @xmath179 since @xmath14 is a probability measure ( and @xmath103 can be split into @xmath180 and the polynomials orthogonal to @xmath180 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this corollary combines with the following lemma about polynomials in two variables to yield one part of the geronimo - woerdeman theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> [ lemma : zeros ] let @xmath181 and suppose there is a @xmath8 such that @xmath182 then , @xmath3 is stable .    </S>",
    "<S> the significance of this lemma is that it tells us when @xmath3 has no zeros on the boundary of the bidisk ( as it is obvious that the above inequality implies @xmath3 has no zeros on the _ open _ bidisk ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , compare this proof to the `` fifth proof of theorem 1.7.1 '' on page 103 in @xcite .    first , </S>",
    "<S> suppose @xmath3 has a zero , say @xmath183 , on @xmath184 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath185 but @xmath186 which fails as @xmath187 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath3 has no zeros on @xmath188 .    </S>",
    "<S> second , suppose @xmath3 has a zero , @xmath183 , on @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> writing @xmath189 we have @xmath190    therefore , @xmath191 which also fails as @xmath187 .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath174 , then @xmath29 is stable .    </S>",
    "<S> this proves one part of the reverse implication of the geronimo - woerdeman theorem . for the rest , we refer the reader to the original paper @xcite .    bernstein - szeg measures on @xmath13 [ sec : bs ] next , we would like to indicate why the forward implication of the geronimo - woerdeman theorem holds . </S>",
    "<S> this involves studying probability measures of the form @xmath192 where @xmath3 is a polynomial in @xmath39 with no zeros in the closed bidisk and @xmath8 is chosen to make @xmath193 a probability measure . </S>",
    "<S> we shall refer to such measures as _ bernstein - szeg measures _ , as they are called in one variable in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the first thing to notice about such measures is that the norm it provides for @xmath194 is equivalent to the norm on @xmath195 with lebesgue measure ( because @xmath3 is bounded above and below on @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , all closures taken with respect to lebesgue measure are equal to closures taken with respect to the norm determined by @xmath193 . for instance , @xmath196 , the closure of the polynomials in @xmath197 , is equal to the usual hardy space @xmath198 .    </S>",
    "<S> another important fact about bernstein - szeg measures is given in the following proposition .    </S>",

    "<S> in essence , the proposition says that @xmath218 reproduces the @xmath198 projection of @xmath219 to @xmath220 .    before proving this </S>",

    "<S> [ polyprop ] the function @xmath242 is a polynomial of degree @xmath243 in @xmath244 and @xmath245 .    </S>",
    "<S> first , notice that if the claim is true when @xmath177 then it is true in general . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of the polarization theorem for holomorphic functions ( i.e. @xmath246 implies @xmath247 ) applied to coefficients of @xmath248 in the expansion of @xmath249 above .    to prove the result for @xmath177 we can appeal to the one variable christoffel - darboux formula . </S>",
    "<S> namely , for each @xmath250 let @xmath251 where @xmath252 is chosen to make @xmath253 a probability measure on @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> then , it is not difficult to check the polynomial in @xmath244 given by @xmath254 satisfies the conditions of the christoffel - darboux theorem ( up to multiplication by a unimodular which does not matter ) . therefore , if we denote the reproducing kernel for @xmath253 for polynomials in @xmath244 with degree up to @xmath243 by @xmath255 , then @xmath256 and this proves @xmath249 is a polynomial in @xmath244 and @xmath245 of degree @xmath243 for @xmath257 .    </S>",
    "<S> these three propositions allow us to prove lemma [ bs : lemma ] with ease .    1 .   the functions @xmath218 equal a sum of a functions orthogonal to @xmath210 by propositions [ projprop ] and [ orthprop ] . </S>",
