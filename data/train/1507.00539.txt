    "<S> ( [ result_backbone ] . ) ) ]    the key point underlying this crossover is that the above analytical results are derived by taking the limit @xmath61 before the long time limit . in this case , to leading order , the tp does not move before being reached by a given vacancy . in fact , the tp actually diffuses due to its interactions with the other vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> because of this effective diffusion of the tp , each vacancy experiences an additional symmetric jump probability in the @xmath1 direction , denoted by @xmath62 , even when they are on the teeth . </S>",

    "<S> . however , due to a subtle coupling between evis and the geometrical constraints involved in the comb geometry , this diffusive regime displays a non analytical dependence on the vacancy density , checked numerically in fig .  4 of the sm  @xcite . </S>",
