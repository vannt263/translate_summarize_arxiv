    "recently , motivated by modern unified theories , gravity in higher dimensions has attracted much interest . in particular , a lot of works are devoted to higher - dimensional black holes ( see for a review @xcite ) .",
    "the rotating black hole solutions of arbitrary dimensions in vacuum were obtained by myers and perry @xcite , and the singly rotating black ring solutions in five dimensions were derived by emparan and reall @xcite .",
    "it is striking that the black ring solutions reveal that a black hole in vacuum is not specified only by its mass and angular momenta , i.e. , higher - dimensional generalization of the black hole uniqueness does not hold in the four - dimensional form .",
    "after this discovery , rich varieties of black rings are found by many authors @xcite .",
    "one of the most important step to study the black holes is the investigation of geodesics in the black hole geometry .",
    "it was shown that the geodesic equations are separable for myers - perry black holes in arbitrary dimensions @xcite . in black ring geometries ,",
    "geodesics are extensively studied in refs.@xcite , and it was reported there that the black ring spacetimes hardly admit separability of general geodesics .",
    "it is an interesting question whether a gravitational object has bound orbits of particles .",
    "it would seem that the existence of stable circular orbits is a characteristic property of the four - dimensional gravity . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the schwarzschild metric in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the parameter related to the mass of the black hole , and @xmath3 is the metric of a unit @xmath4-dimensional sphere .",
    "the effective potential for a free particle in this metric is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mass and the total angular momentum of the particle , respectively . in the four - dimensional case ,",
    "@xmath8 , the first term , centrifugal potential , and the second term , gravitational potential , can make a local minimum which corresponds to a stable circular orbit , while there is no stable circular orbit in the case @xmath9 because the effective potential has no local minimum .",
    "the absence of stable circular orbit was also shown in the five - dimensional myers - perry black holes @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we investigate stable bound orbits around the black ring metrics in five dimensions . in the vicinity of thin black rings ,",
    "the boosted black strings mimic the geometry of the rings .",
    "then , one expects that there exist stable bound orbits near the black ring horizon in spiral shape as in the black string geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "the gravitational field of the black ring in far region is described by the five - dimensional schwarzschild metric , approximately .",
    "then , one would expect that there is no stable circular orbit bound by the black rings in this region .",
    "contrary to this intuition , we show that there exist stable bound orbits of which size can be larger than the size of black ring .",
    "these are stable toroidal spiral orbits in general , and stable circular orbits as special cases",
    ". there exist stable bound orbits of arbitrary large size if the ring thickness is smaller than a critical value .",

    "for the regularity at the two axes of rotation , @xmath17 has to be chosen as @xmath20 the event horizon in the topology s@xmath21 s@xmath22 is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the hamiltonian of a free particle with mass @xmath6 in a metric @xmath24 is generally given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the lagrange multiplier and @xmath27 is the canonical momentum . since @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath19",
    "are cyclic coordinates in the case of black ring metric , the momenta conjugate to these are constants of motion , say @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "then , we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath32 ,   \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    by variation with @xmath26 , we get the hamiltonian constraint condition @xmath36 we regard the system of a free particle around the black ring as a particle moving in a two - dimensional curved space with the effective potential .",
    "the system is constrained by the condition . for understanding the configuration of particle orbit , it is convenient to use coordinates @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 and the effective potential @xmath39 which is given by and .",
    "stationary solutions of the hamiltonian system are specified by @xmath40 the position of the stationary solution in the @xmath41-@xmath42 plane is determined by and the particle energy @xmath43 for the stationary orbit is given by .",
    "the stability of the stationary solutions requires that the stationary points are local minimum of @xmath39 .",
    "typical shapes of the effective potential @xmath39 are shown in fig.[fig : potential_contour ] as contour plots for the black ring metric with the thickness parameter @xmath44 . there",
    "exist local minima of @xmath39 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 are chosen in a suitable finite range and @xmath46 for stable bound orbits are shown in a separate paper @xcite . ] .",
    "a local minimum point @xmath47 , of which position depends on @xmath45 and @xmath46 , implies a stable bound orbit of particle around the black ring .",
    "each world line is tangent to a timelike killing vector which is a linear combination of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and its projection on a timeslice makes a toroidal spiral curve on the two - dimensional torus , direct product of s@xmath22 with radius @xmath51 and s@xmath22 with radius @xmath52 .",
    "whether the toroidal spiral is closed depends on @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "a local minimum point @xmath53 on the @xmath42-axis , fixed two - dimensional plane of the rotation generated by @xmath50 , corresponds to a stable circular orbit with radius @xmath52 .",
