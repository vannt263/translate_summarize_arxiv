    "_ planck _  @xcite , the third generation cosmic microwave background  ( cmb ) satellite will be launched in 2008 ; it will measure the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies @xmath0 at multipoles @xmath1 to @xmath2 at much higher precision than has been possible before . in order to interpret these high fidelity experimental data",
    ", we need to have a correspondingly high precision theory .",
    "understanding precise details of the recombination history is the major limiting factor in calculating the @xmath0 to better than 1 per cent accuracy .",
    "an assessment of the level of this uncertainty , in the context of the expected _ planck _ capabilities , will be the subject of this paper .",
    "the general physical picture of cosmological recombination was first given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they adopted a simple three - level atom model for hydrogen  ( h ) , with a consideration of the ly@xmath3 and lowest order 2s1s two - photon rates .",
    "thirty years later , @xcite performed a detailed calculation by following all the resonant transitions and the lowest two - photon transition in multi - level atoms for both hydrogen and helium in a blackbody radiation background .",
    "@xcite first discussed how the uncertainties in recombination might bias the constraints on cosmological parameters coming from _ planck _ ; this study was mainly motivated by the effect of including the semi - forbidden and high - order two - photon transitions  @xcite , which had been ignored in earlier calculations .",
    "there have been many updates and improvements in the modelling of recombination since then .",
    "@xcite presented a multi - level calculation for neutral helium  ( hei ) recombination including evolution of the radiation field , which had been assumed to be a perfect blackbody in previous studies .",
    "other issues discussed recently include the continuum opacity due to neutral hydrogen ( h )  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the semi - forbidden transition @xmath4p@xmath5s  ( the possible importance of which was first proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the feedback from spectral distortions between @xmath6p@xmath5s and @xmath4p@xmath5s lines , and the radiative line transfer . in particular ,",
    "continuum absorption of the @xmath6p@xmath5s line photons by neutral hydrogen(hi ) causes helium recombination to end earlier than previously estimated  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xcite also found that the high order two - photon rates have a negligible effect on hei , and the same conclusion was made by other groups for hydrogen as well  @xcite , largely because the approximate rates adopted by  @xcite had been overestimated .",
    "the biggest remaining uncertainty in hei recombination is the rate of the @xmath4p@xmath5s transition , which causes a variation equal to about 0.1 per cent in the ionization fraction @xmath7  @xcite .    for hydrogen",
    ", @xcite improved the multi - level calculation by considering seperate angular momentum @xmath8 states .",
    "this brings about a 0.6 per cent change in @xmath7 at the peak of the visibility function , and about 1 per cent at redshifts @xmath9 .",
    "the effect of the induced 2s1s two - photon rate due to the radiation background  @xcite is partially compensated by the feedback of the ly@xmath3 photons  @xcite , and the net maximum effect on @xmath7 is only 0.55 per cent at @xmath10 .",
    "the high - order two photon transitions bring about a 0.4 per cent change in @xmath7 at @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "there are also 0.22 per cent changes in @xmath7 at @xmath12 when one considers the lyman series feedback up to @xmath13 , and there is additionally possibility of direct recombination , although this has only a roughly @xmath14 per cent effect  @xcite .",
    "the list of suggested updates on @xmath7 is certainly not complete yet , since some additional effects , such as the convergence of including higher excited states and the feedback - induced corrections due to the hei spectral distortions , may enhance or cancel other effects . in general",
    "we still need to develop a complete multi - level code for hydrogen , with detailed interactions between the atoms and the radiation field .",
    "however , what is really important here is establishing how these effects propagate into possible systematic uncertainties in the estimation of cosmological parameters .    since the uncertainties in cosmological recombination discussed in the @xcite paper have been reduced or updated , it is time to revisit the topic on how the new effects or remaining uncertainties might affect the constraints on cosmological parameters in future experiments .",
    "the recent full version of the hei recombination calculation  @xcite takes too long to run to be included within the current boltzmann codes for @xmath0 .",
    "so instead , in this paper , we try to reproduce the updated ionization history by modifying recfast  @xcite using a simple parametrization based on the fitting formulae provided by @xcite .",
    "we then use the cosmomc  @xcite code to investigate how much this impacts the constraints on cosmological parameters for an experiment like _ planck_.",
    "in this paper , we modify recfast based on the fitting formulae given by @xcite for including the effect of the continuum opacity of neutral hydrogen for hei recombination .",
    "the basis set of rate equations of the ionization fraction of h and hei used in recfast are : @xmath15 + where @xmath16 + note that @xmath7 is defined as the ratio of free electons per h atom and so @xmath17 during he recombination .",
    "we follow the exact notation used in  @xcite and we do not repeat the definitions of all symbols , except those that did not appear in that paper .",
    "the last term in equation  ( [ eqhei_xe ] ) is added to the original @xmath18 rate for the recombination of hei through the triplets by including the semi - forbidden transition from the @xmath4p state to the @xmath5s ground state .",
    "this additional term can be easily derived by considering an extra path for electrons to cascade down in hei by going from the continuum through @xmath4p to ground state , and assuming that the rate of change of the population of the @xmath4p state is negligibly small .",
    "the superscript ` t ' stands for triplets , so that , for example , @xmath19 is the case b hei recombination for triplets . based on the data given by  @xcite , @xmath19 is fitted with the same functional form used for the @xmath20 singlets  ( see equation  ( 4 ) , in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with different values for the parameters : @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; @xmath23k ; and @xmath24k .",
    "this fit is accurate to better than 1 per cent for temperatures between @xmath25 and @xmath26k . here",
    "@xmath27 is the photoionization coefficient for the triplets and is calculated from @xmath19 by @xmath28 + where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the degeneracies of he@xmath31 and of the hei atom with electron in the @xmath4s state , and @xmath32 is the ionization energy of the @xmath4s state .",
    "the correction factor @xmath33 accounts for the slow recombination due to the bottleneck of the hei @xmath6p@xmath5s transition among singlets .",
    "we can also derive the corresponding correction factor @xmath34 for the triplets .",
    "the @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 quantities are the cosmological redshifting of the h ly@xmath3 , hei @xmath6p@xmath5s and hei @xmath4p@xmath5s transition line photons , respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath38 used in recfast is a good approximation when the line is optically thick ( @xmath39 ) and the sobolev escape probability @xmath40 is roughly equal to @xmath41 . in general , we can relate @xmath38 and @xmath40 through the following equations  ( taking hei as an example ) : @xmath42 + where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the einstein @xmath45 coefficients of the hei @xmath6p@xmath5s and hei @xmath4p@xmath5s transitions , respectively . note that @xmath46s@xmath47  @xcite . for hei @xmath48p@xmath5s ,",
    "we replace @xmath40 by the new escape probability @xmath49 , to include the effect of the continuum opacity due to h , based on the approximate formula suggested by  @xcite .",
    "explicitly this is @xmath50 + where @xmath51 is the h ionization cross - section at frequency @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the thermal width of the hei @xmath6p@xmath5s line .",
    "the @xmath54 factor in @xmath55 is approximately the ratio of the hei @xmath6p@xmath5s transition rate to the h photoionization rate .",
    "when @xmath56 , the effect of the continuum opacity due to neutral hydrogen on the hei recombination is negligible .",
    "here @xmath57 and @xmath58 are fitting parameters , which are equal to 0.36 and 0.97 , based on the results from  @xcite .",
    "we now try to reproduce these results with our modified recfast .",
    "[ fig1](upper panel ) shows the numerical result of the ionization fraction @xmath7 from different hei recombination calculations .",
    "the results from @xcite and @xcite both demonstrate a significant speed up of hei recombination compared with the original recfast .",
    "we do not expect these two curves to match each other , since @xcite just included the effect of the continuum opacity due to hydrogen , which is only one of the main improvements stated in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can regard the @xcite study as giving a simple fitting model in a three - level atom to account for the speed - up of the hei recombination .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows how the ionization history changes with different values of the fitting parameter @xmath58 ( with @xmath57 fixed to be 0.36 ) .",
    "when @xmath58 is larger than 1.2 , the effect of the neutral h is tiny and the fit returns to the situation with no continuum opacity .",
    "however , if @xmath58 is smaller than 1 , the effect of the continuum opacity becomes more significant .",
    "note that when @xmath59 , both the escape probability @xmath49 and the correction factor @xmath33 are close to unity .",
    "this means that almost all the emitted photons can escape to infinity and so the ionization history returns to saha equilibrium for hei recombination .",
    "this simple fitting formula can reproduce quite well the detailed numerical result for the ionization history at the later stages of hei recombination . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we can see that our model with @xmath60 matches with the numerical result at @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "although our fitting model does not agree so well with the numerical results for the earlier stages of hei recombination , the effect on the @xmath0 is neligible .",
    "this is because the visibility function @xmath62 , is very low at @xmath63 ( at least 16 orders of magnitude smaller than the maximum value of @xmath64 ) , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    ". our fitting approach also appears to work well for other cosmological models  ( switzer & hirata , private communication ) .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the fudge factor @xmath65 for h  ( which is the extra factor multiplying @xmath66 ) and the hei parameter @xmath58 in our model to represent the remaining uncertainties in recombination . for hei ,",
    "the factors @xmath57 and @xmath58 in equation  ( [ pconhe ] ) are quite degenerate .",
    "we choose to fix @xmath57 and use @xmath58 as the free parameter in this paper ; this is because it measures the power dependence of the ratio of the relevant rates @xmath54 in the escape probability due to the continuum opacity @xmath55 . for hydrogen recombination , all the individual updates suggested recently give an overall change less than 0.5 per cent in @xmath7 around the peak of the visibility function .",
    "only the effect of considering the separate @xmath8-states causes more than a 1 per cent change , and only for the final stages of hydrogen recombination ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "therefore , we think it is sufficient to represent this uncertainty with the usual fudge factor @xmath65 , which basically controls the speed of the end of hydrogen recombination ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit to the current recombination calculation has @xmath68 .",
    "we use the cosmomc  @xcite code to perform a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) calculation for sampling the posterior distribution with given forecast data .",
    "the simulated _ planck _ data and likelihood function are generated based on the settings suggested in @xcite .",
    "we use full polarization information for _ planck _ by considering the temperature @xmath69 and @xmath70-type polarization anisotropies for @xmath71 , and assume that they are statistically isotropic and gaussian .",
    "the noise is also isotropic and is based on a simplified model with @xmath72k@xmath73 , having a gaussian beam of 7 arcminutes  ( full width half maximum , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for our fiducial model",
    ", we adopt the best values of the six cosmological parameters in a @xmath74cdm model from the _ wmap _ three - year result  @xcite .",
    "the six parameters are the baryon density @xmath75 , the cold dark matter density @xmath76 , the present hubble parameter @xmath77kms@xmath47mpc@xmath47 , the constant scalar adiabatic spectral index @xmath78 , the scalar amplitude ( at @xmath79mpc@xmath47 ) @xmath80 and the optical depth due to reionization ( based on a sharp transition ) @xmath81 .",
    "for recombination , we calculate the ionization history using the original recfast with the fudge factor for hydrogen recombination @xmath65 set to 1.14 and the helium abundance equal to 0.24 .    in this study , we only vary the basic six standard cosmological parameters stated above , together with the hydrogen fudge factor @xmath65 and also the helium @xmath58 factor for the recombination process . of course degeneracies",
    "will in general be worse if one allows for a wider set of parameters .",
    "fig .  [ fig4 ] shows the parameter constraints from our forecast _ planck _ likelihood function using the original recfast code with varying @xmath65 and adopting different priors .",
    "for the _ planck _ forecast data , @xmath65 can be well constrained away from zero  ( the same result as in * ? ? ? * ) and is bounded by a nearly gaussian distribution with @xmath82 approximately equal to 0.1 .",
    "when we only vary @xmath65 with different priors ( compared with fixing it to 1.14 ) , it basically does not change the size of the error bars on the cosmological parameters , except for the scalar adiabatic amplitude @xmath83 . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we can see that the factor @xmath65 controls the speed of the final stages of h recombination , when most of the atoms and electrons have already recombined .",
    "changing @xmath65 affects the optical depth @xmath84 from thomson scattering , which determines the overall normalization amplitude of @xmath0 ( @xmath85 ) at angular scales below that subtended by the size of the horizon at last scattering  ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this is the reason why varying @xmath65 affects the uncertainty in @xmath87 , since @xmath87 also controls the overall amplitude of @xmath0 ( see the upper right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for the marginalized distribution for @xmath65 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "the modified recombination model also changes the peak value ( but not really the width ) of the adiabatic spectral index @xmath88 distribution , as one can see by comparing the dotted and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    based on all the suggested effects on h recombination ,",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath7 is at the level of a few per cent at @xmath67 , which corresponds to roughly a 1 per cent change in @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we have also tried to take this uncertainty into account by considering a prior on @xmath65 with @xmath89 ( the long - dashed curves ) .",
    "we find that the result is almost the same as for the case using @xmath90 for the @xmath65 prior . on the other hand ,",
    "the error bar ( measured using the 68 per cent confidence level , say ) of @xmath87 is increased by 40 and 16 per cent with @xmath90 and 0.01 , respectively .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the comparison of the constraints in the original and modified versions of recfast , with both h and he parameterized . by comparing the solid and dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we can see that only the peaks of the spectra of the cosmological parameters are changed , but not the width of the distributions , when switching between the original and modified recfast codes . allowing @xmath58 to float in the modified recombination model only leads to an increase in the error bar for spectral index @xmath88 among all the parameters , including @xmath65 . for the dashed curves",
    ", we used a very conservative prior for @xmath58 , namely a flat spectrum from 0 to 1.5  ( i.e. from saha recombination to the old recfast behaviour ) .",
    "we can see that the value of @xmath58 is poorly constrained , because the cmb is only weakly sensitive to the details of hei recombination .",
    "nevertheless , this variation allows for faster hei recombination than in the original recfast code and this skews the distribution of @xmath88 towards higher values  ( see also the upper left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this is because a faster hei recombination leads to fewer free electrons before h recombination and this increases the diffusion length of the photons and baryons .",
    "this in turn decreases the damping scale of the acoustic oscillations at high @xmath8 , which therefore gives a higher value of @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , this variation in @xmath58 increases the uncertainty ( at the 68 per cent confidence level ) of @xmath88 by 11 per cent .",
    "based on the comprehensive study of @xcite , the dominant remaining uncertainty in hei recombination is the @xmath4p@xmath5s transition rate , which causes about a 0.1 per cent variation in @xmath7 at @xmath91 . for our fitting procedure",
    "this corresponds to about a 1 per cent change in @xmath58 .",
    "we try to take this uncertainty into account in our calculation by adopting a prior on @xmath58 which is peaked at 0.86 with width  ( sigma ) liberally set to 0.1 . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , one can see that the error bar on @xmath88 is then reduced to almost the same size as found when fixing @xmath58 equal to 0.86 ( the dotted and long - dashed curves ) .",
    "this means that , for the sensitivity expected from _ planck _ , it is sufficient if we can determine @xmath58 to better than 10 per cent accuracy .    as well as",
    "the individual marginalized uncertainties , we can also look at whether there are degeneracies among the parameters . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we see that @xmath65 and @xmath58 are quite independent .",
    "this is because the two parameters govern recombination at very different times . as discussed before",
    ", @xmath58 controls the speed of hei recombination , which affects the high-@xmath92 tail of the visiblity function , while @xmath65 controls the low-@xmath92 part .",
    "in this paper , we modify recfast by introducing one more parameter @xmath58 ( besides the hydrogen fudge factor @xmath65 ) to mimic the recent numerical results for the speed - up of hei recombination . by using the cosmomc code with forecast _ planck _ data , we examine the variation of these two factors to account for the remaining dominant uncertainties in the cosmological recombination calculation . for hei ,",
    "the main uncertainty comes from the @xmath4p@xmath5s rate  @xcite , which corresponds to about a 1 per cent change in @xmath58 .",
    "we find that this level of variation has a negligible effect on the determination of the cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore , based on this simple model , if the existing studies have properly considered all the relevant physical radiative processes in order to provide @xmath7 to 0.1 per cent accuracy during hei recombination , then we already have numerical calculations which are accurate enough for _",
    "planck_.    for h ,",
    "since there is still no comprehensive model which considers all the interactions between the atomic transitions and the radiation background , we consider the size of the updates as an indication of the existing level of uncertainty .",
    "we represent this uncertainty by varying the fudge factor @xmath65 , because the largest update on @xmath7 occurs at @xmath67 , and comes from a consideration of the separate angular momentum states  @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath65 needs to be determined to better than 1 per cent accuracy in order to have negligible effect on the determination of cosmological parameters with _",
    "hydrogen recombination is of course important for the formation of the cmb anisotropies @xmath93 , since it determines the detailed profile around the peak of the visibility function @xmath64 .",
    "a comprehensive numerical calculation of the recombination of h ( similar to hei ) to include at least all the recent suggestions for updates on the evolution of @xmath7 is an urgent task .",
    "we need to determine that the phenomenological parameters @xmath65 and @xmath58 are fully understood at the @xmath94 per cent level before we can be confident that the uncertainties in the details of recombination will have no significant effect on the determination of cosmological parameters from _ planck_.",
    "this work made use of the code cosmomc , written by antony lewis and sarah bridle .",
    "we are also grateful to chris hirata and eric switzer for comparing our results with their own calculations .",
