    "puga@xmath0 appears in two crystal structures with similar electronic structures but different magnetic structures .",
    "et al . _ noted in 1964 the appearance of the two crystal structures and identified the low - temperature ( low-@xmath3 ) form as hexagonal and isostructural with ni@xmath0sn;@xcite the following year larson _ et al .",
    "_ identified the high - temperature ( high-@xmath3 ) form as a 12-layer rhombohedral close - packed structure with space group r@xmath4m.@xcite four decades later , magnetic measurements revealed the low-@xmath3 form to be an antiferromagnet ( @xmath5 k ) and the high-@xmath3 form to be a ferromagnet ( @xmath6 k ) , and specific heat measurements suggest for both phases an electronic structure with heavy fermion character.@xcite    these characteristics place puga@xmath0 in compelling relation to other heavy fermion systems of significant interest .",
    "the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath7 , a measure of the electronic density of states at the fermi energy , has values ( 220 and 100 mj / mol k@xmath8 for low-@xmath3 and high-@xmath3 , respectively ) similar to the heavy fermion superconductors pucoga@xmath9 and purhga@xmath9.@xcite neither of these are magnetic experimentally , though electronic structure calculations favor antiferromagnetic order.@xcite with rather delocalized @xmath1 electrons , puga@xmath0 lies between pucoga@xmath9 and @xmath10-pu,@xcite which has more localized @xmath1 electrons but also shows no localized magnetic moments.@xcite    the combination of magnetic structure and heavy fermion behavior in puga@xmath0 suggest a challenging system for electronic structure calculations .",
    "the electronic structure of pu , many pu compounds , and some other actinide systems requires special attention to be paid to the strong @xmath1 electron correlation .",
    "calculations with `` standard '' density functional theory ( dft ) methods , which involve limited approximate treatments of the electronic correlation , favor an antiferromagnetic structure,@xcite and some aspects are even better modeled with disordered local moments or approximations thereof.@xcite experimentally , pure pu shows no signs of magnetic moments.@xcite the breaking of spin symmetry in dft calculations delivers a static approximation of the spatial separation experienced by dynamically correlated electrons . as a result , calculations allowing a localized magnetic moment can be used to explore nonmagnetic aspects of pu and pu compounds without introducing material - dependent parameters .",
    "the existence of magnetic structures in puga@xmath0 entangles the magnetic moments and the electronic correlation , which , along with their entanglement with the observed crystal structures , motivates this study .",
    "the crystal structures of puga@xmath0 can be viewed as close - packed puga@xmath0 planes with different stacking sequences.@xcite the low-@xmath3 structure follows an ab sequence , as does hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) ; stacking in the high-@xmath3 structure progresses as ababcacabcbc ( with some in - plane distortions away from the perfect close - packed planar structures ) .",
    "this layered , close - packed nature already appears in crystal structures of pure pu : the face - centered cubic structure of @xmath10-pu exhibits abc stacking , the crocker pseudostructure for @xmath11-pu follows from the @xmath11 structure s repeating two planes of a distorted hexagonal structure,@xcite and the orthorhombic structure of @xmath7-pu exhibits close - packed pu planes stacked such that pu atoms in one plane sit above bonds in the plane underneath ( giving rise to an abcd stacking pattern ) .",
    "the close - packed puga@xmath0 planes correspond to the close - packed pu planes with ordered substitutional placing of ga .",
    "these stacking sequences of close - packed planes ( excluding that of @xmath7-pu ) can also be written as sequences of shifts between planes : ab , bc , ca being shifts to the right ( r ) and ac , cb , ba being shifts to the left ( l ) .",
    "abc stacking always shifts in the same direction ( rrrr ) , ab stacking alternates between the two directions ( rlrl ) , and ababcacabcbc stacking , rewritten as ( abca)(cabc)(bcab ) , reverses direction once every four planes ( rrrl ) .",
    "the missing unique pattern with four shifts , rrll , is abcb stacking , which corresponds to double hcp ( dhcp ) , exemplified by @xmath11-la .    while the r and l shifts are equivalent , a stark difference exists between a plane that links two shifts with the same direction and one that sits at a reversal in the direction .",
    "the local environment of the atomic sites in the ideal close - packed lattices has twelve nearest neighbors in both cases .",
    "sites in a plane between two identical shifts have the inversion symmetry , while those between two opposite shifts do not .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry disrupts an otherwise straight line of bonding oriented 60@xmath12 to the planes .",
    "a natural order of the four crystal structures arises : abc stacking has no disruptions , ab stacking has disruptions in every plane , and the remaining two stacking sequences lie in between .",
    "the work presented here applies dft to reveal the interplay between crystal structures based on these four structural patterns , a series of magnetic structures , and the resulting electronic structures .",
    "starting from `` standard '' dft in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , calculations furthermore explore the effects of adding either spin - orbit coupling or a hubbard @xmath2 ( in the gga+u method ) .",
    "the calculations presented here set aside thermal effects , in particular those due to phonons .",
    "preliminary calculations of the phonons and their contribution to the free energy suggest they can not make the low-@xmath3 phase more favorable in the gga to dft without specifically addressing @xmath13 electron correlation .",
    "the dft calculations employ the vasp package.@xcite they make use of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof.@xcite the pu(@xmath14 ) and ga(@xmath15 ) electrons are treated in the valence using a plane - wave basis and with projector - augmented wave potentials.@xcite the calculations employ methfessel - paxton smearing ( with width 0.1 ev ) , a k - point mesh of density 40  @xmath16 , and an energy cutoff of 400 ev . the self - consistent cycles are converged to within 10@xmath17 ev .",
    "calculations aimed at improving the treatment of the the on - site coulomb repulsion between 5@xmath13 electrons use an effective hubbard parameter @xmath2 in the rotationally invariant form of dudarev _",
    "et al._.@xcite in this form the hubbard parameter @xmath2 and the exchange parameter @xmath18 appear only in the difference @xmath19 , throughout this report the difference is referred to as @xmath2 .",
    "calculations that include the effects of spin - orbit coupling do so in the noncollinear mode of vasp,@xcite the implementation follows the approach of kleinman and macdonald , picket , and koelling.@xcite    the calculations optimize crystal structures that start as ideal close - packed planes with one pu and three ga atoms , stacked according to one of the four patterns described above .",
    "relaxation of the structures retains the overall layered structure , but displacements within the planes make initially equivalent planes lose their exact equality .",
    "the size of the unit cell , in particular the number of planes ( between two and twelve ) , follows from the particular pattern and the magnetic structure used to seed the calculations .",
    "the latter either has all spins in the same direction for the ferromagnetic ( fm ) structure , or spins that switch direction every one , two , three , four , or six planes .",
    "these arrangements define spin wave structures with wave vectors @xmath20 of magnitude @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and , in the fm case , @xmath26 , scaled by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents the interplanar spacing .",
    "additional magnetic structure within the close - packed plane affects the results , but these are not reported here , other than to note that their energy lies above that of the antiferromagnetic ( afm , @xmath29 ) state .",
    "the results from three approaches appear in the following three subsections . sections",

    "the preference for this cubic structure appears only for the magnetic structure with the shortest spin wave length ; for longer spin wave lengths it lies higher than the other states ( albeit by small amounts ) . among the fm states the high-@xmath3 phase lies lowest , the slight 13 mev / puga@xmath0 difference to the low-@xmath3 phase suggests the importance of thermal effects .",
