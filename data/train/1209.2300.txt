    "given a finite metric space @xmath0 with metric @xmath1 we define the spread @xmath2 by @xmath3 this is one of a family of metric space ` sizes ' as we will see in section  [ section : leinstercobbold ] where we will also see the motivation for this definition .",
    "this generalizes easily from finite metric spaces to arbitrary metric spaces with a measure , as will be seen in section  [ section : measurespaces ] .",
    "one of the things that we will be interested in is how this measure of size alters as the metric is scaled , so we need to define some notation . for @xmath4",
    "let @xmath5 denote the metric space @xmath0 with the metric @xmath1 scaled up by a factor of @xmath6 , so that the distance in @xmath5 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "we can consider the spread profile of the space @xmath0 which is just the graph of @xmath10 for @xmath4 .",

    "we consider the space @xmath12 , for @xmath13 , having three points , two of which are a distance @xmath6 apart and are both a distance @xmath14 from the third point .",
    "this family of metric spaces can be thought of as having three ` regimes ' : where @xmath6 is very small and there looks likes there is one point ; where @xmath6 is smallish and there looks like there are two points ; and where @xmath6 is very large and it looks like there are three points .",
    "this way of thinking is reflected in the values plotted .",
    "so we wish to think of the spread @xmath15 as akin to an ` effective number of points ' .",
    "the basic properties of spread can now be given .",
    "for @xmath0 a finite metric space with @xmath16 points , the spread has the following properties :    * @xmath17 ; * @xmath10 is increasing in @xmath6 ; * @xmath18 as @xmath19 ; * @xmath20 as @xmath21 ; * @xmath22 .",
    "these results all follow easily from the definition .    in this paper",
    "we consider further properties of the spread which are summarized in the following synopsis .      in the first section we recall leinster and cobbold s diversity measures  @xcite and",
    "show how that gives rise to the spread @xmath15 of a metric space as the order - zero diversity of the metric space equipped with the uniform probability distribution .",
    "this means that the spread can be thought of as an analogue of the number of species in an ecosystem .",
    "we all see that there is a spread @xmath23 of order @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and relate these to generalized means .    in the second section",
    "we compare the spread with leinster s notion  @xcite of the magnitude of a metric space .",
    "we show that if the space has a positive definite ` similarity matrix ' then the magnitude is an upper bound for the spread , and if the space is homogeneous then the magnitude is equal to the spread .",
    "we then go on to consider a space with no magnitude , or rather , a space whose magnitude profile is discontinuous and see that the spread profile is very similar , but much better behaved . finally in this section",
    "we see that two spaces with the same magnitude profile can have different spread profiles .    in the third section",
    "we show that the definition of spread generalizes immediately to infinite metric spaces which are equipped with a measure .",
    "we calculate the spread of @xmath26 the straight line interval of length @xmath27 with the usual lebesgue measure and show that for large @xmath27 the spread is approximately @xmath28 .",
    "then we consider the spread of compact riemannian manifolds , giving the spread of the @xmath29-sphere explicitly , and we show that asymptotically , as the manifold is scaled up , the leading order terms in the spread are determined by the volume and the total scalar curvature of the manifold .    in the final section we consider the growth rate of the spread as the metric space is scaled .",
    "this gives a scale dependent notion of ` dimension ' .",
    "for instance if millions of points are formed into the shape of a square , then at small scales it will look like a point , i.e.  zero dimensional , at medium scales it will look two dimensional , and at very large scales it will look like a collection of isolated points , i.e.  zero dimensional , again .",
    "we look at numerical calculations for some simple approximations to fractals and see that at the medium scales the ` spread dimension ' is related to the hausdorff dimension of the fractal .",
    "in this section we recall the notion of leinster - cobbold diversity measures and show how this gives rise to the spread of a metric space .",
    "we also see how generalized notions of spread relate to generalized means .",
    "in  @xcite leinster and cobbold defined certain ` diversity measures ' .",
    "these are numbers associated to any finite set equipped with a probability distribution and a ` similarity matrix '  we will see that a metric on a finite set gives rise to a similarity matrix in a canonical way . these numbers are supposed to measure the biodiversity of a community where the points represent the different species , the similarity matrix represents the similarity between the species ( a metric represents distance between the species ) and the probability distribution represents the relative abundances of the species .    before defining the diversity measures we need to define the notion of a similarity matrix .",
    "if @xmath0 is a finite set with @xmath16 points @xmath30 then a similarity matrix @xmath31 is an @xmath32 matrix with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath35 then this represents @xmath36 and @xmath37 being completely dissimilar and if @xmath38 then this represents @xmath36 and @xmath37 being completely identical .",
    "a metric @xmath1 on @xmath0 gives rise to a similarity matrix @xmath31 by setting @xmath39 , so that nearby points are considered very similar and far away points dissimilar .",

    "we also have @xmath46 and the order @xmath24 diversity can be thought of as an ` effective number of species ' .",
    "the leinster - cobbold diversity measures generalize a classic family of diversity measures known as the hill numbers  @xcite .",
    "the hill number of order @xmath24 , @xmath47 , for @xmath42 $ ] is defined for a finite set @xmath0 with probability distribution @xmath44 on it , so it requires no metric or similarity matrix .",
    "this hill number can be obtained as the leinster - cobbold diversity of the identity similarity matrix , or , equivalenty , of the ` discrete ' metric where all of the points are infinitely far apart from each other ; so all species are considered to be completely dissimilar .",
    "symbolically , we have @xmath48 the hill numbers at the values @xmath49 give , respectively , the following classical diversity measures : the number of species , the exponential shannon index , the simpson index and the reciprocal berger - parker diversity .",
    "we can think of this specialization to hill numbers as using the leinster - cobbold diversity measure to get measures of a finite probability space by equipping the space with a canonical metric , namely the discrete metric . on the other hand we could use the leinster - cobbold diversity measures to get measures of the size of a finite _ metric _ space by equipping the space with a canonical _ probability distribution _",
    ", namely the uniform distribution .",
    "this gives rise to the spread .",

    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ]      fundamental to the definition of the leinster - cobbold diversity measures is the idea of generalized mean  @xcite .",
    "here we give a description of the @xmath24-spread in those terms .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a finite metric space with @xmath16 points @xmath30 , then each point @xmath36 has a reciprocal mean similarity denoted by @xmath56 and defined , as the name suggests , as follows : @xmath57 we have @xmath58 and think of the reciprocal mean similarity as being a measure of how different the space is from the point @xmath36 , with @xmath56 being nearly @xmath59 if all the points are close to @xmath36 and nearly @xmath16 if all of the points are far from @xmath36 .    in order to get a measure of the whole space we can take an average of these reciprocal mean similarities .",
    "there are many different averages we could take . for a set of numbers @xmath60 and a number @xmath61 ,",
    "the @xmath62-mean @xmath63 is defined , when @xmath64 as @xmath65 and as a limit when @xmath66 .",
    "this includes many standard means : @xmath67 is the maximum , @xmath68 is the quadratic mean , @xmath69 is the arithmetic mean , @xmath70 is the geometric mean , @xmath71 is the harmonic mean , and @xmath72 is the minimum .",

    "in this section we recall leinster s notion of magnitude and show how it relates to the spread .",
    "we look at examples of a metric space with no magnitude and two metric spaces with the same magnitude .",
    "magnitude was introduced by leinster in  @xcite .",
    "it is defined for ` most ' metric spaces in the following way . for @xmath0 a metric space a weighting on @xmath0 consists of a weight @xmath80 for each @xmath81 such that @xmath82 if a weighting exist then @xmath83 the magnitude of @xmath0 is defined to be the sum of the weights : @xmath84 if it exists then the magnitude is independent of any choice in the weighting .",
    "the definition of magnitude comes from enriched category theory , although it had previously appeared in the biodiversity literature  @xcite . for an example of a space without a magnitude see section  [ section : naughtyexample ] below .",
    "there are large classes of spaces for which the magnitude is known to exist : one class of spaces on which it is defined is the class of ` positive definite spaces ' .",
    "a positive definite finite metric space is a finite metric space for which the similarity matrix @xmath31 is positive definite .",
    "examples of positive definite spaces include subspaces of euclidean space .",
    "one nice property of the magnitude of positive definite spaces is the following .    [",
    "* corollary  2.4.4 ) ] if @xmath0 is a positive definite space then @xmath83 is well defined , furthermore if @xmath85 then @xmath86 is also positive definite and @xmath87 .",
    "the magnitude is related to the leinster - cobbold diversity via the ` maximum diversity ' @xmath88 . before defining that we say that a space @xmath0 has a non - negative weighting if there is a weighting for @xmath0 in which all of the weights are non - negative .",
    "the maximum diversity is defined to be the maximum of the magnitudes of subsets of @xmath0 with a non - negative weighting : @xmath89 for instance , from the positive definite subset bound it follows that if @xmath0 is positive definite with non - negative weighting then @xmath90 .",
    "the connection with diversity is given by the following theorem .",
    "for @xmath0 a metric space and for any @xmath42 $ ] the maximum value of the leinster - cobbold diversity of order @xmath24 , over all probability distributions on @xmath0 , is given by the maximum diversity : @xmath91    this explains the name .",
    "the maximum diversity is certainly in some sense much better behaved than the magnitude , however it is considerably harder to calculate in general .",
    "we can now look at some basic comparisons .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a finite metric space .    1 .",
    "the spread of @xmath0 is bounded - above by its maximum diversity : @xmath92 2 .",
    "if @xmath0 is positive definite then its maximum diversity is bounded above by its magnitude , and thus so is its spread : @xmath93    1 .",
    "this follows from immediately leinster s maximizing theorem and the interpretation of @xmath2 as the order - zero leinster - cobbold diversity of @xmath0 with the uniform probability distribution .",
    "[ part : two ] by definition , the maximum diversity of @xmath0 is the magnitude of a subset @xmath86 of @xmath0 , so by the positive definite subset bound , if @xmath0 is positive definite then @xmath94 .",
    "note that the positive definite condition in part  [ part : two ] of the above theorem can not simply be removed as we will see in section  [ section : naughtyexample ] that there is non - positive definite space with magnitude smaller than spread .",
    "we can show that the spread is actually equal to the magnitude in the special case of a homogeneous metric space . recall that a homogeneous space is a space in which the points are all indistinguishable , or ,",
    "more precisely , a homogeneous metric space is a space with a transitive action by a group of isometries .    if @xmath0 is a homogeneous finite metric space then the magnitude and the spread coincide : @xmath95 more generally , the magnitude is equal to the @xmath24-spread for all @xmath42 $ ] : @xmath96    if @xmath0 has @xmath16 points , then the speyer s formula  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) for the magnitude of a homogeneous space , we have for any @xmath81 that @xmath97 on the other hand , every point in @xmath0 has the same mean reciprocal similarity @xmath98 , with @xmath99 the @xmath24-spread @xmath50 is just the @xmath77-mean of the set of mean reciprocal similarities .",
    "but the @xmath77-mean of @xmath16 copies of @xmath98 is just @xmath98 , thus @xmath100 as required .",
    "there is slightly interesting notational coincidence when @xmath31 is invertible : @xmath101      here we look at an example , given by leinster in  @xcite , which has a discontinuity in its magnitude profile and look at its continuous spread profile .",
    "consider the five - point space @xmath102 illustrated in figure  [ figure : badmagnitude ] , equipped with the metric induced by the pictured graph , so that points on the same side are a distance @xmath103 from each other and points on opposite sides are a distance @xmath59 from each other .",
    "as we scale this space , considering @xmath104 for @xmath4 , we see that when @xmath105 this has no magnitude .",
    "however , @xmath106 is defined for all values of @xmath4 , and this seems to be a well - behaved version of the magnitude .",
    "this example also shows that magnitude is not always an upper bound for the spread .",

    "in this section we define the notion of spread dimension of a metric space which is the instantaneous growth rate of the spread of the space .",
    "this notion of dimension is scale dependent .",
    "for instance , we will see that a long , thin rectangular array of points can have spread dimension close to zero , one , or two , depending on the scale .",
    "finally , we look at the spread dimension of some finite approximations to simple fractals and see that the spread dimension is close to the hausdorff dimension at some scales .      now that we have a notion of size of a metric space",
    ", we can look at the growth rate of this size as a measure of the ` dimension ' of the space .",
    "typically one looks at the asymptotic growth rate as a measure of dimension , but it is interesting here to look at the instantaneous growth rate .",
    "the size is very scale dependent in a non - obvious way so looking at how the growth rate varies is very interesting .",
    "for a real - valued function @xmath175 defined on some subset of the reals , we can define the growth rate at @xmath6 by @xmath176 for example , if @xmath177 then @xmath178 .",
    "another way of writing this is as @xmath179 the instantaneous growth rate is the gradient in a @xmath180-@xmath180 plot of the function .    we define @xmath181 the instantaneous spread dimension , or just spread dimension , of a metric space @xmath0 to be @xmath182 where @xmath183 , in other words , @xmath184    it is then informative to look at examples of this instantaneous spread dimension as the space is scaled .",
    "the following examples were calculated using ` maple ` on a processor with 16 gb of ram .    file picsdata / linenomatrixe0derivn30000.dat ; ; file picsdata / rectanglenotplote0derivx220y220.dat ; ; file picsdata / rectanglenotplote0derivx10y4900.dat ; ; expression 1 ; expression 2 ;      as a first set of examples we can look at three types of rectangular grids with equally spaced points .",
    "the spread - dimension profiles are shown in figure  [ figure : rectangulargriddimensions ] .",
    "starting first with the grid of @xmath185 points , or , in other words , a line of @xmath186 points , we see that when the points are very close together the spread dimension is close to zero , reflecting the fact that the ` line ' at that scale is point - like . as the line of points",
    "is scaled up , it looks more and more like a line , so when the interpoint distance is @xmath187 units , meaning the length is @xmath188 units , the spread dimension is close to one . as the line of points",
    "is scaled up further and further , so that the interpoint distance is @xmath109 units , say , the point - like nature is apparent and the spread dimension drops to zero .    considering the square grid of @xmath189 points",
    ", we see that this starts off looking like a point at small scales , with the spread dimension being close to zero , then as the square grid is scaled up to about @xmath190 units by @xmath190 units , with an interpoint distance of about @xmath191 units , it looks more like a genuine square and has an spread dimension of just under two",
    ". then as the square grid is scaled up further , the point - like nature is apparent and the spread dimension drops to zero .",
    "the most interesting case shown is where we consider the rectangular grid of @xmath192 points .",
    "again , at small scales the spread dimension is close to zero whilst the grid looks like a small point .",
    "then as it is scaled up there is a regime , around where the rectangle is of the order of @xmath191 units by @xmath193 units , where the space looks ` line - like ' and the dimension is approximately one . as it is scaled up further to around @xmath109 units by @xmath194 units , the width is apparent and the spread dimension heads towards two .",
    "finally , as it is scaled up further , the point - like nature becomes apparent and the spread dimension descends to zero .    from this",
    "we deduce that the spread @xmath15 is clearly measuring something geometric .",
    "we now look at the spread dimension of certain finite approximations to fractal sets in euclidean space , namely to the ternary cantor set , the koch curve and the sierpinski triangle .",
    "we can look at the spread dimension profile and see that at certain scales the spread dimension is roughly the hausdorff dimension of the corresponding fractal , indicating that spread is a reasonable measure of the size of these fractals , and , indeed , of these approximations to these fractals .",

    "this is approximated by starting with two points a distance @xmath27 apart on a line .",
    "we use the two contractions of the line by a factor of a third which respectively leave the two points fixed . by applying these two contractions successively up to @xmath109 times , starting at the initial points ,",
    "we obtain @xmath195 points .",
    "the spread dimension at various lengths @xmath27 can then be computed numerically . in figure",
    "[ fig : fractaldimensions ] we see that at small scales the spread dimension is close to zero corresponding to the fact that the space looks like a point at those scales .",
    "similarly , at very large scales , the space looks like a collection of distant points and the spread dimension is again zero . at intermediate scalings ,",
    "roughly for @xmath196 the spread dimension is roughly the hausdorff dimension of the cantor set , namely @xmath197 , indicating that the space looks more ` cantor set - like ' at those scales .",
    "the top - right picture in figure  [ fig : fractaldimensions ] is an enlargement of the cantor set profile , and shows that things are apparently more intriguing than one might guess . at intermediate scales ,",
    "the spread dimension seems to oscillate around the hausdorff dimension , with the oscillations being of _ multiplicative _ period @xmath198 .",
    "such small oscillations were observed for the magnitude of the cantor set in  @xcite .",
    "i have no good explanation for these oscillations at the moment .    in the next case",
    "we look at the koch curve . again",
    ", this is approximated by starting with a couple of points and iteratively applying one of four contractions , to obtain a finite metric space contained in the koch curve .",
    "the graph shows that as the approximation is scaled up from very small , the spread dimension increases to roughly the hausdorff dimension , @xmath199 , where it remains over a range of scales , before descending to zero as the approximating space is scaled up sufficiently so that it s discrete , point - like nature is apparent .",
    "the final example of the sierpinski triangle is generated in the same way using an iterated function system , and shows the same behaviour , namely , of having roughly the same spread dimension as its hausdorff dimension at certain scales .",
    "these examples should serve to show that there is something interesting going on which has yet to be examined fully .",
