    "the very small cross sections of neutrinos , however , make their flux from the region of the galactic center very difficult to detect . on the contrary",
    ", the gamma - ray spectrum from dm annihilation or decay may be detectable with sufficient statistics , energy resolution , and over an extended angular distribution , to provide a very distinctive set of information related to both the particle identity of the wimp and its astrophysical distribution .",
    "a major challenge is in separating the dm signal from any astrophysical backgrounds , whose energy spectrum and angular distribution are not well known .",
    "a major change in the prospects for dm detection has occurred in the last few years , following the discovery of a bright astrophysical source of tev gamma rays from the galactic center . as a result of this discovery , we now know that dm emission from the galactic center will not be detectable in a ( quasi ) background - free regime , and  unless one turns the attention to other targets  the peculiar spectral shape and angular distribution of the signal must be used to extract it from this and other backgrounds .",
    "this topic is the main subject of this review .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ instr ] we briefly describe the capabilities of current high energy gamma - ray telescopes . in sec .",
    "[ signal ] we review the features of the dm annihilation signal , both in its energy ( sec .  [ espectra ] ) and angular dependence ( sec .",
    "[ angshape ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ gc ] we review the prospects for detecting or constraining dm annihilations in the galactic center region , while in sec .",
    "[ innerhalo ] we briefly discuss some interesting aspects of the diffuse signal from the inner halo . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we report our conclusions . appendix a briefly illustrates the qualitative changes to the considerations we develop in the main text when decaying ( as opposed to annihilating ) dm is considered .",
    "appendix b describes a subtlety regarding the angular shape of the signal arising for a velocity - dependent annihilation cross section .",
    "the ability of gamma - ray experiments to identify dm annihilation radiation from the galactic center region relies on the effective area , angular and energy resolution of the existing telescopes , as well as the rejection of other ( mostly hadronic ) cosmic ray events contaminating the gamma - ray sample . since the mean free path of gamma rays",
    "is much shorter than the atmospheric slant depth , direct observations in the gev region and above can only be done from space  which is the strategy pursued by the lat detector on the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( formerly glast )  @xcite  or indirectly by ground - based imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescopes ( iacts ) such as hess  @xcite , magic  @xcite , veritas  @xcite and cangaroo - iii  @xcite . in the latter category ,",
    "the direction and energy of the primary particle hitting the atmosphere is reconstructed from the cherenkov emission of the secondary charged particles generated in the atmospheric shower .",
    "these differences lead the two classes of experiments to adopt different strategies in the search for dm .",
    "fermi - lat is very effective in rejecting hadronic events , and continuously monitors a large fraction of the sky , but has an effective area of only @xmath1m@xmath2 , far smaller than that of ground - based telescopes , @xmath3m@xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , iacts study small angular fields and have a lower rejection capability , but much greater overall exposure . as a consequence , diffuse gamma - ray signals are better probed by fermi - lat .",
    "any unidentified sources detected by fermi - lat which lack a low - energy counterpart could be potentially attributed to dm substructure .",
    "iacts would be very effective in providing detailed follow - up observations of such sources .",
    "in addition , the accessible energy range is very different between these two classes of experiments : @xmath4100 mev to 300 gev for fermi - lat , and above @xmath4100 gev for acts .",
    "this difference makes fermi - lat most sensitive to dm particles lighter than a few hundreds gev , while iacts are better suited for tev - scale or heavier wimps . on the other hand ,",
    "the fermi - lat has poorer angular resolution than iacts , so it is less accurate in the localization of point - like sources . for both instrument classes ,",
    "the search for indirect dm signatures is among the top physics priorities .",
    "the reach of fermi - lat and current and future iacts has been recently assessed in ref .",

    "the differential flux of gamma rays ( photons per unit area , time , energy and steradian ) produced in dm annihilations is described by @xmath5\\int_{\\rm{los } } \\rho^2(\\ell,\\omega)\\ , \\d \\ell , \\label{flux1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the wimp annihilation cross section multiplied by the relative velocity of the two wimps ( averaged over the wimp velocity distribution ) , @xmath7 is the mass of the wimp , @xmath8 is the position - dependent dm density , and the integral is performed over the line - of - sight ( los ) in the direction of the sky , @xmath9 . the gamma - ray spectrum generated per wimp annihilation is @xmath10 , it has units of energy@xmath11 and its integral over energy is equal to 1 . if the dm is not its own antiparticle as assumed here , eq .",

    "the integral over the line - of - sight determines instead the angular dependence of the signal and is controlled by the astrophysical distribution of dm .",
    "we shall discuss each of these two terms in the following , assuming that this factorization holds ( see  [ entanglingeandang ] for a discussion of possible violations of this hypothesis ) .",
    "in convenient units , eq .",
    "( [ flux1 ] ) can be recast as : @xmath14 the dimensionless function @xmath15 depends only on the dm distribution in the halo and is defined by convention as  @xcite @xmath16 for typical halo models ( see sec .",
    "3.2 ) this is a function strongly peaked towards the galactic center ( for an illustration , see for example fig .",
    "a1 ) .    the benchmark value for the cross - section , @xmath171 picobarn ( or in cgs units @xmath18 ) ,",
    "is motivated by the fact that a wimp annihilating with such a cross section during the freeze - out epoch will be generated as a thermal relic with a density similar to the measured dm abundance ( for a review , see ref .",
    "wimps constituting the _ cold _ dm annihilate in the non - relativistic limit",
    ". if annihilations take place largely through @xmath19-wave processes , then the annihilation cross section of wimps in the galactic halo ( i.e. in the low velocity limit ) will also be approximately equal to this value , which justifies the benchmark value used in eq .",
    "( [ flux2 ] ) . yet , it is important to stress that much lower signals are possible ( e.g. if @xmath20wave annihilation dominates the freeze - out process ) , as well as significantly enhanced ones in models where the dm is non - thermally produced in the early universe ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . some further considerations and refs . can be found in  [ entanglingeandang ] .",
    "it is also worth noting that for s - wave annihilating thermal relics the indirect detection signal has two advantages compared to direct detection via nuclear recoils in underground detectors : i ) it is proportional to a relatively large annihilation cross section ; ii ) it is less dependent from the particle physics details .",
    "for example , even under the ( possibly unrealistic ) assumption that dm annihilates mostly into quarks of the first generation , the natural expectation value for dm - nucleon elastic cross section is at the level of @xmath21pb@xmath22cm@xmath2 . for dm annihilating predominantly into heavier particles ,",
    "a further suppression is expected .",
    "[ spectra ]    the gamma - ray spectrum from dm annihilation originates from several different contributions . typically , the most abundant source of photons is the hadronization and/or decays of unstable particles .",
    "for example , neutralinos in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , dominantly annihilate to final states consisting of heavy fermions @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( i.e. bottom quarks , top quarks and tau leptons , respectively ) or bosons @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are the gauge bosons mediating the weak interactions and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the higgs bosons of the mssm  @xcite . with the exception of the @xmath40 channel , each of these annihilation modes result in a very similar spectrum of gamma rays , dominated eventually by the decay of mesons , especially @xmath41 , generated in the cascade . in fig .  1 we show the predicted gamma - ray spectrum per annihilation , for several possible wimp annihilation modes .",
    "the harder spectrum here shown from annihilation into the @xmath42 channel is not typical of susy models , although it might be a distinctive feature of dm annihilating dominantly to charged leptons pairs ; this arises , for example , in kaluza - klein dm models ( for a review of particle dm models , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "although these secondary photons provide the dominant emission , other important channels can exist at the one - loop level .",
    "a particularly striking signature would be the mono - energetic photons resulting from final states such as @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of these processes within the context of supersymmetry ) .",
    "unfortunately , such processes are expected to produce far fewer events than continuum emission and in typical models can not easily be detected ( for a counterexample , see ref .",
    "bremsstrahlung ( with an additional photon appearing in the final state ) is automatically present when annihilations produce charged final states , and can dominate the high energy region of the spectrum when those charged annihilation products are much lighter than the wimps .",
    "this is particularly important when the tree - level processes to a pair of light fermions are disfavored by `` selections rules '' , but no suppression is present for three body final states  @xcite . for more details ,",
    "see the review by l.  bergstrom in this issue  @xcite .",
    "note that gamma - ray emission from dm annihilating into standard model particles is unavoidable , even in the most extreme case when only neutrino final states are allowed at tree level , due to @xmath46 and @xmath47-strahlung  @xcite .      the gamma - ray spectrum and angular distribution predicted by eq .",
    "( [ flux1 ] ) is rather general ( see , however , appendix b ) , and could be applied to the case of a smoothly distributed galactic halo , or alternative targets such as dwarf spheriodal galaxies , microhalos / clumps , density spikes around intermediate mass black holes , or the integrated extragalactic diffuse background ( described in other contributions to this special issue ) . while some of these targets have interesting observational prospects , the intensity of these signals is strongly dependent on often unknown cosmological and astrophysical properties , such as the quantity of small - scale structures in dm halos or the population of intermediate mass black holes in the milky way . in this article , we will focus on the smooth galactic halo .    naively , by inputing the dm density profile inferred from kinematical observations of the milky way into eq .",
    "( [ flux1 ] ) , one could obtain an approximate lower bound on the gamma - ray flux from dm annihilation . in principle , this would enable us to translate the observations from ground or space - based gamma - ray telescopes into constraints on the particle physics properties of the wimp ( mass , annihilation cross section and dominant modes ) . unfortunately ,",
    "even the average , smooth distribution of the dm particles in our galaxy is not well known , especially in the volume within the solar circle .",
    "this is due to the fact that the baryonic material dominates the gravitational potential in the inner galaxy , and lacking a detailed knowledge of its distribution , a reconstruction of the dm distribution `` by subtraction '' is unfeasible .",
    "it is not surprising , then , that very different profiles have been claimed to fit the observations ( for example , compare the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    on general grounds , a class of spherically symmetric , smooth halo distributions can be used to approximately fit both the observed rotation curves of galaxies and the results of numerical simulations of dm halos . a non - trivial angular dependence of the gamma - ray signal results from the off - center position of the sun within the halo ( see e.g. ref .",

    "finally , we have included only the hess and egret sources ( in addition to the diffuse background ) in our analysis , but it is likely that other astrophysical point sources with different spectra will be discovered by fermi - lat .",
    "the above estimates should be quite realistic as long as a limited number of discrete sources will `` contaminate '' the inner galactic center angular bins , so that they could be removed effectively by the fermi team . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worth taking a lesson from the `` sudden '' discovery of an astrophysical source just at the galactic center : in the worst case , the galactic center region might so crowded with ( yet unknown ) sources that the separation of background and signal might be degraded with respect to expectations based on present knowledge . still , it is worth mentioning that the bulk of the statistical significance of the dark matter annihilation signal typically does not come from the inner @xmath108 around the galactic center ( where the iact source dominates ) , rather from the surrounding angular region .",
    "it is then interesting to see what are the perspectives to detect a dm signal from a more extended region , which we address in the following .",
    "the emission of radiation per unit solid angle from dm annihilation is expected to be maximized at the galactic center . yet",
    ", geometric factors and the presence of point - like and diffuse backgrounds make the choice of the optimal window size a non - trivial problem  @xcite .",
    "unless the dm halo is very cuspy towards the galactic center ( say , cuspier than nfw ) , the optimal strategy for dm searches is never to focus on the inner sub - degree around the galactic center .",
    "rather , a window size up to @xmath109 or more is preferred .",
    "the optimal shape of the window depends on the angular distribution of the signal and backgrounds , but also on the details of the analysis ( like energy cuts , astrophysical foreground removal , etc . ) .",
    "it could be optimized from morphological studies of the low - energy emission measured by fermi , but a circular annulus around the galactic center or a `` rectangular '' window in galactic coordinates  with an inner rectangular mask generally work fairly well . here",
    "we illustrate this issue within a simplified model : based on egret data , in the diffuse background one can identify an isotropic , extragalactic component @xmath110 and a galactic component scaling as @xmath111 , which is however dominant at gev energies and peaks towards the galactic plane ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the energy spectrum of the dm signal thus mostly enters the game in determining which one of the two spectra ( of different angular shape ) dominates the background : the harder the dm spectrum , the closer the background is to an isotropic emission , the smaller the optimal angular window .",
    "still , even in the quite extreme case of @xmath112gev monochromatic lines , the optimal angular window is very extended .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we plot the relative signal - to - noise ( @xmath113 ) as a function of the maximum galactic latitude , @xmath114 , for a galactic region @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "the solid lines refer to an hypothetical gamma - line emission for the benchmark `` model i '' in the inert higgs doublet scenario ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) for three different halo profiles .",
    "the dot - dashed line refers to the continuum spectrum of a 100 gev neutralino annihilating into @xmath117 with an nfw distribution , where indeed we see that the optimal window is even more extended than for the line signal : this is due to the fact that the background at the typical energies of the continuum dm photons , @xmath118 , is mostly dominated by the galactic unresolved background , which peaks towards the galactic plane / center .    to give a feeling of the quantitative difference with respect to the gc case treated in the previous section ,",
    "let us note that for our usual benchmark model ( @xmath119gev , @xmath120pb with @xmath80 final state ) , a `` naive '' count statistics above 1 gev ( including all backgrounds ) would lead to a @xmath121 for the @xmath81 window considered in sec .",
    "4 , while for the region considered above and @xmath122 one would find almost 40000 events from dm vs. about seven millions background events , resulting in a @xmath123 . of course , this analysis does not take into account angular and energy cuts that ( as shown for the gc case above ) do improve the diagnostic power , as well as other possible systematics .",
    "yet , the importance of this diffuse signal can not be underestimated ( and it is actually confirmed by other analyses , see sec .",
    "4.2 in ref .",
    "[ 6 ] ) , especially in the case no signal is revealed from the gc , which may be due to a inner halo profile more cored than nfw .",
    "the extended signal has indeed a milder dependence on the profile . also , from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it is clear that  at least for the simple @xmath113 estimator ",
    "it is only important to adopt the right angular cut within a factor of two or so in order not to degrade the sensitivity by more than@xmath124 .",
    "but `` blindly '' focusing on a too narrow window ( degree scale ) around the gc might be overly penalizing ; especially for relatively cored profiles , the loss in sensitivity may reach a factor of two or more .    besides improving the prospects for detection , other advantages in focusing on an extended region around the galactic center include :    * enabling an empirical determination of the dark matter profile slope outside of the region dominated by the gravitational potential of the central supermassive black hole . * obtaining independent evidence that an `` excess '' signal with respect to backgrounds is the product of dm annihilation , by comparing the emission from many angular regions .",
    "in contrast , if the spectrum is found to vary with location , it is most likely the product of astrophysical backgrounds . * constraining the quantity of dark matter substructure in the halo , by observing the angular distribution of the emission .",
    "the shape of the smooth , unresolved inner profile  @xcite could be studied , in addition to an anisotropy / multipole analysis  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , may have important implications for dm cosmology ; see the review by t.  bringmann in this issue .",
    "the most challenging task for indirect dark matter searches is not to detect a few events , but to confidently identify those events as the products of dark matter annihilations . in particular",
    ", any signal must be separated from astrophysical backgrounds if it is to be reliably claimed to be a detection of dark matter .",
    "this is certainly true in the case of gamma - ray telescopes hoping to observe dark matter annihilations in the region of the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the discovery of a bright tev source of astrophysical origin at the gc by iacts has changed the prospects for such searches considerably .",
    "one strategy in light of this is to focus on different targets with lesser astrophysical background ( such as dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "another is to search for a signal in the `` noisy '' gc region , by taking advantage of the peculiar spectral and angular properties expected from dark matter annihilation products .    in this paper , we have reviewed the latter strategy , reporting on recent studies of the gc and inner galaxy .",
    "given the characteristics of this search , the lat instrument on board of the fermi satellite is better suited than existing iacts .",
    "fermi - lat instrument will detect a number of astrophysical sources in the region of the sky around the gc , including the point sources previously identified by hess and egret , and perhaps others .",
    "a diffuse gamma - ray background will also likely be present .",
    "although predictions of fermi s sensitivity are unavoidably limited by our incomplete knowledge of these backgrounds , we have shown that the spectral and angular differences between the signal and backgrounds should be distinctive enough to allow one to separate signal from background over a significant region of the parameter space , at least for a sufficiently cusped dark matter profile ( nfw - like or steeper ) .    in the optimistic case where dark matter annihilation products are identified by fermi ,",
    "then it may also be possible to measure or constrain the properties of the dark matter , including its mass , annihilation cross section , and spatial distribution .",
    "it is unlikely that fermi will determine the wimp s mass with high precision , however .",
    "for example , for the case of a 100 gev wimp with an annihilation cross section of @xmath125 @xmath92/s , distributed with an nfw halo profile , the mass could be determined to lie within approximately 50 - 300 gev . in the same benchmark model , the inner slope of the dark matter halo profile",
    "could be determined to @xmath106 precision .",
    "the combination of several indirect detection channels will be crucial to both confirm such a detection , and to best constrain the wimp s properties .",
    "on the other hand , it is not excluded that fermi will lead to a radical revision of the present gamma - ray picture of the gc , revealing a more complicated zoo of astrophysical accelerators than envisaged in the present estimates . in the case where either the dm signal from the gc is too low or the the background is too large / complex ,",
    "a dm discovery in gamma rays is still possible by looking at the emission from an extended region in the inner halo with fermi , or from other dark matter substructures with both fermi - lat and iacts",
    ". in particular , the morphology and the spectral properties of the unresolved galactic background at @xmath126gev will be useful to optimize the angular and energy - cut templates for searches of the dm emission from an annulus of several tens of degrees around the gc .",

    "de - ac02 - 07ch11359 with the us department of energy and by nasa grant nnx08ah34 g .",
    "finally , we thank sergio palomares ruiz for noticing a typo in the v2 of the manuscript .",
    "in the case of decaying dark matter , eq .  ( [ flux1 ] ) is modified to @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the decay width ( inverse lifetime ) and the spectrum now refers to the photons generated in the decay process . unlike with the cross section in the case of annihilating dark matter , one does not have any strong theoretical motivation for considering any particular lifetime for an unstable dm particle . in any case",
    ", arguments have been put forward justifying the typical range of the lifetimes needed for significant signatures in astrophysics with @xmath4tev mass particles and gut - scale physics mediating the process ( in analogy with the expected proton decay in guts ) , see e.g.  @xcite . from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", there are a couple of points worth mentioning regarding decaying dm candidates :    * the dm distribution and the role of substructures in particular is of little importance in determining the level of the signal . *",
    "the angular distribution of the gamma - ray signal is very distinctive , and much flatter than the corresponding annihilation signal , as illustrated for a nfw profile in fig .",
    "( [ fig : angular ] ) .    should gamma rays be detected from dm , a comparison between the emission in the inner galaxy and the emission at high latitude would immediately reveal the nature of the particle physics process ( annihilation or decay ) responsible for the emission  @xcite .",
    "notice that this information is very difficult to extract with other cosmic ray probes .",
    "although the factorization between the particle physics term and astrophysical term in eq .  ( [ flux1 ] ) is a useful approximation and valid in most practical cases , there are exceptions .",
    "more correctly , one should write @xmath129 \\rho^2(\\ell,\\omega)\\ , \\d \\ell , \\label{flux3}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is the relative velocity between the two particles ( with @xmath131 ) and @xmath132 its distribution function ( not necessarily isotropic ) , whose integral over @xmath133 is normalized to unity .",
    "the factorization assumed in eq .",
    "( [ flux1 ] ) holds only if the integral in square brackets  which is nothing but @xmath6is independent of position . a sufficient condition for this",
    "is that @xmath134 is velocity - independent . in general , the integral depends on the kinematical structure of the halo via the position - dependent velocity dispersion , anisotropy , etc .",
    "then , both the astrophysical distribution of the dm and the particle physics contribute in determining the angular shape of the signal .",
    "one case in which the factorization is not valid can be found when the wimp annihilations mainly through a @xmath135-wave process , such that @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "this is a largely academic case , however , since whenever @xmath135-wave annihilation is dominant the gamma - ray signal is expected to be suppressed .",
    "more interesting is the case in which non - perturbative processes lead to large `` sommerfeld enhancements '' to the annihilation cross section at low velocities  @xcite .",
    "this effect can be thought of as the distortion of the wave - function due to a relatively long - range attraction between the wimps . in this case , a further steepening of the signal towards the galactic center is expected , which in turn should ease the detection of gamma rays from the inner galaxy  @xcite .",
