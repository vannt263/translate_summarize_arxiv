    "hard scattering in qcd is accompanied by soft radiation of gluons caused by the drastic accelerations of color charge .",
    "the resulting antenna patterns are predicted to be particularly simple for @xmath1 hard scattering processes in which one of the final particles is colorless @xcite .",
    "the possibility of using the radiation pattern to identify the underlying parton structure of observed events has been called `` partonometry '' @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we address the question of how partonometry can be carried out in practice , and how it can be used to make further studies of qcd .    as a specific example that is accessible to experiment",
    ", we study the process @xmath2 at the fermilab tevatron energy @xmath3 .",
    "the predicted cross section for @xmath4 with @xmath5 or @xmath6 is @xmath7 , which is large enough for an ample number of events to be collected in the cdf and d0 experiments at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "similar physics can also be studied in @xmath8 or direct photon + jet production .    at lowest order in qcd",
    ", @xmath9 production comes from three incoherent partonic subprocesses : @xmath10 the first two of these are `` compton '' subprocesses that are distinguished from each other by the direction of their initial gluon , which is in the @xmath11 direction for ( [ eq : type1 ] ) and @xmath12 for ( [ eq : type2 ] ) .",
    "the third `` annihilation '' subprocess has a slightly larger cross section than the sum of the compton subprocesses , because of the dominance of quarks over gluons in the parton distributions at the moderate values of @xmath13 involved here .",
    "`` partonometry '' in this instance is the ability to recognize which of the three hard subprocesses ( [ eq : type1])([eq : type3 ] ) was responsible for a given @xmath9 event . in section 2",
    "we will see that the subprocesses have very distinct radiation patterns .",
    "these patterns are quite striking , but unfortunately the ability to distinguish them is hampered by large fluctuations of the radiation around these average distributions . to model the fluctuations , as well as the underlying background event and hadronization effects , we use the monte carlo program herwig @xcite , which has the correct correlations included to produce the radiation patterns that we seek . in section 3",
    "we define some event variables that are useful for distinguishing the underlying subprocesses . in section 4",
    "we describe the monte carlo simulation that we use and show that it reproduces the radiation patterns that we expect , even after the underlying event and hadronization have been included .",
    "our main results are in section 5 , where we identify an observable of the soft radiation which can be used to discriminate between the parton - level subprocesses , and we show how this observable can be tested by experiment .",
    "finally , in section 6 we give our conclusions .",
    "in the large @xmath14 limit , soft gluon radiation from the three basic subprocesses is proportional to @xcite @xmath15 for processes ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) , respectively .",
    "the `` lego '' variables here are defined relative to the jet location : @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 the pseudorapidity and @xmath19 the azimuthal angle .",

    "[ fig : pipe ] . here",
    "@xmath20 is along the cylindrical axis , @xmath21 is the azimuthal angle , and the intensity of the radiation is proportional to the distance from the cylindrical axis . note that these radiation patterns only depend on the coordinates relative to the jet and are completely independent of the direction of the @xmath22 boson .

    "each of the partonic subprocesses ( [ eq : type1])([eq : type3 ] ) is predicted to have its distinctive radiation pattern , as we have seen .",
    "unfortunately , these radiation patterns can not be observed directly , because for real events  unlike the simulated ones  one does not know which of the three subprocesses is responsible for any given event . to establish this physics with a testable prediction",
    ", we must study a global correlation that is based on the fact that any particular event is caused by a single one of the three production subprocesses .",
    "therefore , a typical event should have _ either _ enhanced radiation at @xmath23 ; _ or _ enhanced radiation at @xmath24 ; _ or _ reduced radiation at @xmath25 , @xmath26 . looking for these characteristics of the radiation in an event - by - event basis",
    "is also what is needed to achieve the promise of `` partonometry '' @xcite . of course",
    ", in practice the underlying subprocess can only be determined with some probability , due to fluctuations in the soft radiation patterns .",
    "there are three necessary steps to partonometry .",
    "first , we must identify an observable function of the soft radiation that discriminates between partonic subprocesses .",
    "second , we need to be able to test the prediction experimentally . finally , we need a quantitative measure of the discrimination efficiency of our observable .",
    "the second step requires comparison with another event observable that _ does not _ depend on the properties of the soft radiation in the event .",
    "an observable based on information inside the jet cone is the natural choice .    in what follows",
    "we give a concrete example of partonometry using the soft radiation observable @xmath27 .",
    "we also use the jet observable @xmath28 as a cross check of this discriminator .",
    "these may or may not prove to be the best variables when detector effects are included .",
    "nonetheless , the procedure should be applicable to a wide variety of observable quantities .",
    "the predictions from herwig for @xmath27 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmbps ] .    .",
    "solid curve : quark jets ( from subprocess ( [ eq : type3 ] ) ) ; dotted curve : gluon jets ( from subprocesses ( [ eq : type1 ] ) and ( [ eq : type2 ] ) ) . ]    the differences between the curves satisfy our first criterion above .",

    "there is a clear difference between the quark jets ( subprocess ( [ eq : type3 ] ) ) and the gluon jets ( subprocesses ( [ eq : type1 ] ) and ( [ eq : type2 ] ) ) , with the latter tending toward larger values of @xmath28 , i.e. , gluon jets are fatter . the correlations between figs .",
    "[ fig : fmbps ] and [ fig : x ] provide the qualitative and quantitative tests for our soft radiation predictions .    to observe the correlation",
    ", we divide the data sample into bins of @xmath27 and then calculate the mean value of @xmath28 in each bin . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xfbs ] .     as a function of @xmath27 . ]    for a pure sample of gluon jets or quark jets , the value of @xmath33 increases mildly with @xmath27 , indicating that @xmath33 increases with the amount of soft radiation , as one would expect .",
    "however , we predict that the combined data will show a _ decrease _ in @xmath34 with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "this is an unambiguous qualitative test of the soft radiation patterns .",
    "the decrease comes about because as @xmath27 increases , the likelihood that the outgoing jet is a quark increases , reducing the value of @xmath34 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluonfrac ] , where we plot the fraction of outgoing gluon jets as a function of @xmath27 , as calculated using herwig .",
    "the gluon or quark jet fraction can be made as high as 80% by focusing on events with very large or small values of @xmath27 , albeit at the expense of statistics .",
    ", as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "]    even stronger discrimination between the processes can be achieved by using both variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 in tandem .",
    "soft radiation patterns in @xmath0 production provide a novel insight into the structure of qcd . in this paper we have identified the most important structures in the radiation patterns , and we have defined an observable , @xmath27 , that can be used to distinguish the three partonic subprocesses ( [ eq : type1])([eq : type3 ] ) .",
    "we have also shown how this observable can be cross - checked against a second observable , @xmath34 , which relies only on information from inside the jet cone .",
    "the prediction , shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : xfbs ] , is a striking one : we predict a negative correlation between the amount of radiation inside the jet cone and the amount of radiation outside it .",
    "this arises solely because more radiation outside the cone is associated with a higher probability of the jet being a quark jet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluonfrac ] .",
    "the negative correlation is otherwise opposite to the naive expectation that the radiation outside the cone should rise with the radiation inside  as is confirmed for quark jets alone or gluon jets alone in fig .",
    "[ fig : xfbs ] .",
    "the ability to discriminate between the underlying soft radiation patterns is potentially useful as a tool for identifying and studying parton - level subprocesses .",
    "one could imagine using this information both as a means to separate the gluon from the quark parton distribution functions in the initial state and as a method to study the differences between quark and gluon jets in the final state .",
    "we emphasize again that the procedure we have outlined for utilizing and testing the soft - radiation effects could be followed for a variety of soft - radiation and jet observables .",
    "further work may be needed in particular to optimize the suggested observables to suit detector limitations .",
    "in addition , the details presented here rely on the use of herwig for producing the hadronization effects and the background event .",
    "information on jet properties taken directly from experiment @xcite may be used to lessen this dependence on the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the important point is that the soft radiation effects should remain and can be discerned .",
    "observing these patterns is both interesting in its own right and as a novel probe of the underlying partonic structure of qcd .",

    "many other possibilities are available .",

    "the peak is at @xmath43 for subprocess ( [ eq : type1 ] ) , as expected from the average antenna patterns .",
    "the fraction of events of this type with @xmath43 is @xmath44 . in other words ,",
    "if one attempts to discriminate between equal numbers of subprocess ( [ eq : type1 ] ) and subprocess ( [ eq : type2 ] ) on the basis of @xmath40 , the correct assignment is made @xmath44 of the time .",
    "a second quantity that can be considered is just the total amount of soft radiation @xmath45 .",
    "the histogram in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] shows the probability distributions for @xmath45 for two different ranges of the rapidity of the outgoing jet .",

    "normal dots and dashes are for @xmath49 ; sparse ones are for @xmath50 . ]    the most important property of a soft - radiation observable is the ability to distinguish events with outgoing gluon jets ( subprocess ( [ eq : type3 ] ) ) from events with outgoing quark jets ( subprocesses ( [ eq : type1 ] ) and ( [ eq : type2 ] ) ) . to quantify this ability for a given observable @xmath51",
    ", we consider a sample of events that contains equal numbers of outgoing gluon and quark jets .",
    "this is close to the actual predicted mix .",
    "we then identify the 50% of events with the largest values of the observable @xmath51 as quark - jet events and the 50% of events with the smallest values of @xmath51 as gluon - jet events .",
    "the percentage of correctly - assigned events is then a measure of the discrimination power of the observable @xmath51 at 100% efficiency .    with this definition ,",
    "we find a discrimination power for @xmath52 of 60% .",
    "as expected , the forward - backward difference is better at distinguishing subprocess ( [ eq : type1 ] ) from subprocess ( [ eq : type2 ] ) than it is at distinguishing either from subprocess ( [ eq : type3 ] ) .",

    "ignoring contributions from cells of size @xmath53 in @xmath54 that receive less than @xmath55 , @xmath56 , or @xmath57 of transverse momentum ; 2 .   using multiplicity or charged multiplicity in place of the scalar sum of @xmath58 as the measure of radiation intensity",
    "; 3 .   generalizing the observables to include @xmath59 regions in @xmath60 , each which may be assigned a different weight .",
    "these variations were found to be useless . in particular , variation ( 1 )",
    "might have been expected to help by reducing the effect of the background event . on the contrary ,",
    "however , provided herwig s model for the background event is correct , this is more than offset by a simultaneous reduction in the accuracy of measuring the signal .",
    "variation ( 3 ) was explored extensively by using the monte carlo data itself .",
    "cutting the @xmath60 plane into @xmath61 discrete regions allowed each event to be represented by an @xmath62-tuple vector consisting of the transverse momentum deposited into each of the @xmath62 regions .",
    "one could then attempt to classify a given event , whose underlying subprocesses is taken to be unknown , by its closest resemblance to other events whose underlying subprocess is taken to be known , using a suitable metric .",
    "this procedure amounts to an idealization of what a neural network approach would only be able to approximate .",
    "however , it was not found to do any better than the classification based on @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath63 .    for conceptual simplicity ,",
    "we have concentrated on the region @xmath64 . to increase statistics ,",
    "this region can be extended to @xmath65 with very little change in the symmetric distributions such as @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "meanwhile , the ability to distinguish between subprocess ( [ eq : type1 ] ) and subprocess ( [ eq : type2 ] ) on the basis of the antisymmetric quantity @xmath39 actually improves with increasing @xmath68 because of an accidental circumstance : the general radiation pattern peaks around @xmath69 for kinematical reasons .",
    "this tendency increasingly favors negative @xmath39 as @xmath48 becomes positive ; but subprocess ( [ eq : type2 ] ) increasingly dominates over subprocess ( [ eq : type1 ] ) in that limit because of parton distribution effects , as is shown in fig .",
