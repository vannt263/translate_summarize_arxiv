    "galactic winds and outflows are the primary mechanism by which galaxies deposit energy and metal - enriched gas into the intergalactic medium ( igm )",
    ". this can greatly affect the evolution of the igm , and the subsequent formation of other generations of galaxies .",
    "feedback by galactic outflows can provide an explanation for the observed high mass - to - light ratio of dwarf galaxies and the abundance of dwarf galaxies in the local group , and can solve various problems with galaxy formation models , such as the overcooling and angular momentum problems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "galactic outflows can explain the metals observed in the igm via the lyman-@xmath2 forest ( e.g. @xcite ) , the entropy content and scaling relations in x - ray clusters @xcite , and provide observational tests that can constrain theoretical models of galaxy evolution .",
    "local examples of spectacular outflows in dwarf starburst galaxies include those of the extremely metal - poor i zw 18 ( @xcite ) and ngc1569 @xcite .",
    "more massive spirals , such as ngc7213 @xcite , also show evidence of global outflows . for a review of the subject ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "large - scale cosmological simulations have become a major tool in the study of galaxy formation and the evolution of the igm at cosmological scales .",
    "these simulations start at high redshift with a primordial mixture of dark and baryonic matter , and a spectrum of primordial density perturbations .",
    "the algorithm simulates the evolution of the system by solving the equations of gravity , hydrodynamics , and ( sometimes ) radiative transfer . adding the effect of galactic outflows in these simulations poses a major practical problem . in one hand",
    ", the computational volume must be sufficiently large to contain a `` fair '' sample of the universe , typically several tens of megaparsecs .",
    "on the other hand , the physical processes responsible for generating the outflows take place inside galaxies , at scales of kiloparsecs or less .",
    "this represents at the very minimum 4 orders of magnitude in length and 12 orders of magnitude in mass , which is beyond the capability of current computers .",
    "since we can not simulate both large and small scales simultaneously , the usual solution consists of simulating the larger scales and using a _ subgrid physics _ treatment for the smaller scale .",
    "cosmological simulations can predict the location of the galaxies that will produce the outflow , but can not resolve the inner structure of these galaxies with sufficient resolution to simulate the actual generation of the outflow .",
    "instead , the algorithm will use a prescription to describe the propagation of the outflow and its effect on the surrounding material .",
    "one possible approach consists of depositing momentum or thermal energy `` by hand '' into the system , to simulate the effect of galactic outflows on the surrounding material @xcite .",
    "the algorithm determines the location of the galaxies producing the outflows and calculates the amount of momentum or thermal energy deposited into the igm based on the galaxy properties ( mass , formation redshift @xmath3 ) .",
    "then , in particle - based algorithms like smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , this momentum or energy is deposited on the nearby particles , while in grid - based algorithms it is deposited on the neighboring grid points .",
    "this will result in the formation and expansion of a cavity around each galaxy , which is properly simulated by the algorithm .",
    "a second approach consists of combining the numerical simulation with an analytical model for the outflows .",
    "tegmark et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have developed an analytical model to describe the propagation of galactic outflows in an expanding universe . in this model , a certain amount of energy is released into the interstellar medium ( ism ) by supernovae ( sne ) during an initial starburst .",
    "this energy drives the expansion of a spherical shell that propagates into the surrounding igm , until it reaches pressure equilibrium .",
    "this model , or variations of it , has been used extensively to study the effect of galactic outflows on the igm ( @xcite , hereafter pmg07 ; @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "the evolution of the igm and the propagation of the outflow are calculated separately , but not independently as they can influence one another .",
    "the presence of density inhomogeneities in the igm can affect the propagation of the outflow , while energy and metals carried by the outflow can modify the evolution of the igm .",
    "there are several limitations with this second approach .",
    "in particular , it assumes that the initial starburst , which occurred during the formation of the galaxy , is the only source of energy driving the expansion of the outflow .",
    "first , the starburst lasts for a short period of time , typically 50 million years .",
    "hence , we would expect to observe very few galaxies having an outflow .",
    "furthermore these galaxies would be just forming and therefore would have complex and chaotic structures .",
    "observations show instead that outflows are ubiquitous and often originate from well - relaxed galaxies ( see @xcite and references therein ) . second , even though the injection rate of energy is maximum during the initial starburst , the total amount of energy which is injected afterward by all generations of sne and stellar winds could be comparable or even more important . even if this energy is injected slowly over a large period of time , the cumulative effect could be significant .",
    "indeed , an initial outflow caused by a starburst could be followed by a steady galactic wind that would last up to the present .",
    "the role of stellar winds has been mostly ignored in analytical models and numerical simulations of galactic outflows .",
    "third , there is the possibility that accretion of intergalactic gas onto the galaxy might trigger a second starburst .",
    "finally , a recent study @xcite suggests that there is a significant time delay between the initial starburst and the onset of the outflow , something not considered by current models .",
    "another important issue is the amount of metals contained in the outflow , the spatial distribution of metals in the outflow , and the relative abundances of the various elements .",
    "the metallicity of the outflow depends on the metallicity of the ism at the time of the starburst .",
    "the metals contained in the ism at that time can have several origins : ( 1 ) metals already present in the gas when the galaxy formed , ( 2 ) the sne produced during the starburst , and ( 3 ) the stellar winds generated by massive stars and agb objects .",
    "hence , the composition of the outflows will depend on the epoch of formation of the galaxy ( which determines the initial metal abundances ) , as well as the relative amount of metals injected into the ism by type  ia sne , core - collapse sne ( types  ib , ic and ii ) , and winds , and the timing of these various processes .",
    "as for the amount of metals injected in the igm , models often assume that it is proportional to the mass of the galaxy , and do not provide a description of the distribution of metals in the outflow and the relative abundances of the elements ( @xcite ; pmg07 ) .      _",
    "our goal is to develop a new galaxy evolution model to improve the treatment of galactic winds in cosmological simulations .",
    "_ this model will describe not only an initial starburst and its resulting outflow , but the entire subsequent evolution of a galaxy up to the present .",
    "it will take into account the progressive injection of energy by sne and stellar winds ( which could cause a steady galactic wind that would follow the outflow and last up to the present ) , and the time - evolution of the metallicity and composition of the ism that would directly affect the composition of the galactic wind .",
    "it will also provide a description of the metal content , metal distribution , and chemical composition of the galactic wind .",
    "this emphasis on the structure and composition of the galactic wind is what distinguish our model from recent semi - analytical models of galaxy formation , which tend to focus on reproducing the properties of the galaxies themselves ( luminosity and mass functions , halo properties , disk sizes , @xmath3 ) . for a review of the various semi - analytical models , see @xcite .",
    "our approach combines a population synthesis algorithm to describe the stellar content of the galaxy , an analytical model for the expansion of the galactic wind , and a new model for the distribution of elements inside the galactic wind .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we describe the method we use to calculate the mass and chemical composition of stellar winds and sn ejecta , a key ingredient of our algorithm . in  3 , we describe the basic equations for the evolution of the ism . in  4 , we describe our galaxy wind model .",
    "results are presented in  5 , and conclusions in  6 .",
    "starburst99 @xcite is the population synthesis code we selected to simulate the properties of the stellar winds and sne produced by stellar populations with various characteristics . in this project ,",
    "all simulations use an instantaneous sfr to produce a stellar population of mass @xmath4 , with a standard imf as defined by @xcite .",
    "this population is evolved up to a final time  @xmath5 , with a timestep @xmath6 ( small enough to reproduce each evolutionary phase ) .",
    "the evolutionary tracks are a combination of the geneva tracks at young ages ( @xmath7 ) with the padova tracks at old ages , to better reproduce the mass loss phases of the massive stars as well as those of smaller - mass objects .",
    "we consider four values of the initial metallicity ( @xmath8 , 0.004 , 0.008 , and solar metallicity 0.02 ) .",
    "we also specify that all stars with an initial mass @xmath9 of 8 to @xmath10 will end as sne . binary systems which may also produce sne",
    "are not included in this code and not considered here .",
    "the mass we chose for the stellar population , @xmath4 , is large enough to provide a good sampling of the imf .",
    "yet , it is much smaller than the stellar mass of even dwarf galaxies .",
    "this enables us to simulate any galaxy sfr we want . to simulate an instantaneous starburst with a stellar mass larger than @xmath11 , we simply rescale the results produced by starburst99 . to simulate a sfr that is extended over a finite period of time , we offset the simulations , such that",

    "top panel ) , stellar wind mechanical energy ( @xmath13 , middle panel ) , and mass loss rate by stellar winds ( @xmath14 , bottom panel ) have been obtained for a @xmath15 stellar population , using starburst99 .",
    "different metallicities have been considered as indicated in the top panel.,width=316 ]    starburst99 provides , as a function of time , the mechanical energy produced by sne and stellar winds , the mass loss by stellar wind , and the chemical composition of the stellar winds , which takes into account the following elements : h , he , c , n , o , mg , si , s , and fe .",
    "the code can also predict the mass loss by sne , but for this project we prefer to use a more detailed treatment which also gives the chemical abundances of the sn yields for a more extensive list of elements .",
    "this treatment is described in the next section .",
    "therefore , the ejected mass calculated by starburst99 will only include the contribution of stellar winds . in figure  [ lum_sn ]",
    ", we plot the luminosity ( rate of mechanical energy injection ) associated to sne , @xmath16 , and stellar winds , @xmath13 , and the mass loss by stellar winds , @xmath14 , versus time , for stellar populations with different metallicities .",
    "the initial metallicity has very little effect on the sne luminosity , but greatly impacts the luminosity and mass loss by stellar winds .",
    "this implies that stellar populations that form later will have more powerful winds , since they form out of an ism that has already been enriched in metals by earlier populations .",
    "figure  [ lum_sn ] shows a sudden increase in wind power around 1 - @xmath17 , just prior to the arrival of the first sne , which is caused by the evolved stages of ob stars , i.e. the wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the increase in mass loss after @xmath18 is caused by the low - mass stars on the agb .      except in situations where the metallicity of the stars is larger or equal to solar",
    ", the enrichment of the ism is dominated by sne ( see fig .  8 of @xcite ) . thus , it is important to know the composition of the material ejected by sne as a function of the initial mass and metallicity of the stellar progenitors .",
    "several groups have used models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis to produce tables of chemical abundances for sn ejecta .",
    "these studies are summarized in table  [ table_sne ] .",
    "the first column gives the authors of the papers ; the second and third columns list the metallicities and initial masses considered , respectively ; the fourth column indicates whether or not mass loss prior to the sn explosion was included in the model .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_masseject ]    starburst99 requires tables of sne at metallicities @xmath19 , 0.004 , 0.008 , and 0.02 .",
    "at this point we have tables at @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for @xmath22",
    ", we interpolated between the tables at @xmath20 and 0.02 using @xmath23 as an interpolation variable .",
    "we now have a full set of sn tables that provides the ejected mass and composition of the ejecta , for all progenitors in the range @xmath24 - @xmath10 and @xmath25 - @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ masseject ] shows the ejected mass versus progenitor mass .     and up to @xmath27 , for @xmath28 .",
    "the dotted line illustrates the @xmath28 model of wh07 .",
    "colors have the same meaning as in figure  [ masseject].,width=316 ]    .",

    ", width=316 ]    at each timestep during the simulation , starburst99 provides the number of sne and their luminosity ( adopting that each sn produces @xmath32 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sn tables are then used to calculate at every timestep the mass and composition of the material deposited into the ism . for simulations with initial metallicity @xmath25",
    ", we use the luminosity at @xmath33 which is the smallest value considered by starburst99 .",
    "figure  [ massloss_sn ] shows the mass loss rate due to sne for a @xmath34 instantaneous burst .",
    "this completes the results shown in figure  [ lum_sn ] . in the top panel of figure  [ masseject_pop ]",
    ", we plot the total mass ejected by sne versus metallicity , for the same population .",
    "the dotted curve shows our extrapolation method , while the solid curves show the three other methods .",
    "the `` constant '' method of @xcite ( using the ejecta for @xmath35 at higher masses ) is the one which resembles our method the most , but there are significant differences .",
    "this justifies _ a posteriori _ the method we have developed in this section .",
    "we assume a minimum progenitor mass of @xmath36 , but we also generated other tables using different values .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ masseject_pop ] shows the ejected mass for minimum progenitor masses of @xmath29 , @xmath36 ( the value assumed in this paper ) , and @xmath37 .",
    "the differences are of order 50% , with the ejected mass being larger for a smaller minimum progenitor mass .",
    "this shows that the particular choice of minimum progenitor mass can have a impact on the results , and we intend to investigate this issue in more details in future work . here",
    "we focus on the case of a minimum progenitor mass of @xmath36 .    in a recent paper , @xcite point to a serious `` supernova rate problem '' : the measured cosmic massive - star formation rate predicts a rate of core - collapse supernovae about twice as large as the observed rate , at least for redshifts between 0 and 1 , where surveys are thought to be quite complete .",
    "several explanations are proposed to explain this major discrepancy , including a large fraction of unusually faint ( intrinsically or dust - attenuated ) , and thus unaccounted for , core - collapse sne and a possible overestimate of the star formation rate based on the current estimators .",
    "if indeed this supernova rate problem is real , the sfr ( see  5.1 ) might have to be scaled accordingly .",
    "however , all simulations presented in this paper start at redshift @xmath38 , and terminate at redshifts between 6 and 9 .",
    "it is not clear that there is a supernova rate problem at these redshifts .",
    "during the evolution of a galaxy , the ism is constantly enriched by ejecta from stellar winds and sne .",
    "hence , every generation of stars provides an environment richer in metals for the future generations .",
    "the level of this enrichment depends on the sfr , since the metal production increases with the number of stars formed . to simulate this process",
    ", we designed an algorithm that combines the outputs of starburst99 with the sne tables of n06 .",
    "we consider a galaxy with a total mass @xmath39 .",
    "we assume that the ratio of baryons to dark matter in the galaxy is equal to the universal ratio , which is a valid assumption for the initial stages of the galaxy .",
    "the baryonic mass of the galaxy is then given by @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the total and baryon density parameters , respectively .",
    "we assume that each galaxy starts up with a primordial composition of hydrogen and helium ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "the formation of the galaxy results in a starburst , during which a fraction @xmath0 of the baryonic mass is converted into stars .",
    "the total mass in stars at the end of the starburst is therefore @xmath45    we refer to the parameter @xmath0 as the star formation efficiency .",
    "we consider three different types of star formation rate : instantaneous , constant , and exponential . with an instantaneous sfr , all stars form at @xmath46 . in the other cases ,",
    "the stellar mass formed @xmath47 and the star formation rate @xmath48 are related by @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the final time of the simulation . for a constant sfr , we have @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the duration of the starburst .",
    "we usually choose a value for @xmath48 and solve equation  ( [ sfr_const ] ) for @xmath52 . for an exponential sfr",
    ", we have @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the characteristic time .",
    "since star formation never ends in this case , the stellar mass formed depends on the final time @xmath50 .",
    "equation  ( [ sfr_expn ] ) is valid in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "there are some caveats about equations  ( [ mbaryons ] ) and ( [ mstar ] ) .",
    "the infalling gas must cool and form molecular clouds which then fragment into stars .",
    "if star formation is delayed until all the gas has cooled , then equation  ( [ mbaryons ] ) would be valid , but it is more likely that star formation will start while a fraction of the gas has not cooled yet .",
    "sne and stellar winds from that first generation of stars will inhibit the formation of subsequent generations of stars , by reheating the ism and possibly expelling some of it in the form of a galactic outflow .",
    "observations of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath56 show that star formation is a very inefficient process , with @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath58 in equation  ( [ mbaryons ] ) is an upper limit , which does not take into account the gas lost by galactic outflows . as for the reheating of the gas and suppression of inflow , it is implicitly taken into account in equation  ( [ mstar ] ) by introducing a star formation efficiency @xmath0 .",
    "the mass of gas that was reheated and prevented from forming stars is @xmath59 . in this paper , we consider star formation efficiencies @xmath60 , 0.2 , 0.5 , and 1.0 .",
    "equations  ( [ mbaryons ] ) and ( [ mstar ] ) then give @xmath61 , 0.032 , 0.081 and 0.162 , respectively .",
    "the first two values are consistent with observations .",
    "the last two values are quite extreme , and we considered them mostly to investigate the behavior of the model under extreme conditions .    in this paper , we impose various forms for the sfr to investigate the effect of the sfr on the properties of the galactic outflows .",
    "the effect of feedback and reheating of the ism is all contained implicitly in the value of @xmath0 . to provide a proper treatment of the aforementioned feedback processes",
    ", we intend to modify the model such that the sfr will be recalculated at every time step , from the physical conditions of the ism gas at that time , taking into account the effect of all previous generation of stars .",
    "this will provide a consistent treatment of feedback and self - regulating star formation , and eliminate the need to specify a priori a star formation efficiency @xmath0",
    ". this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "our algorithm tracks the evolution of @xmath62 , the mass of element x contained in the ism . at the beginning of each timestep ,",
    "the total mass of the ism is given by @xmath63    where the sum is over all elements included in the algorithm , that is all elements from hydrogen ( @xmath64 ) to gallium ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "these quantities are initialized at the beginning of the simulation , and updated during each timestep @xmath12 , as follows .",
    "first , we calculate the mass ejected by stellar winds and sne .",
    "we include the contribution from all stars present at that time , taking into account their _ current _ ages , initial metallicities , and initial masses : @xmath66    where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are the current age , initial metallicity , and mass of population @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the sums are over all the stellar populations that have already formed by time @xmath71 .",
    "the superscript sb99 indicates quantities calculated by starburst99 .",
    "we also calculate the total luminosity produced by sne and stellar winds : @xmath72    we then remove from the ism the total mass of the stars born during that timestep , and the mass removed by the galactic wind , and add the material ejected by sne and stellar winds : @xmath73\\delta t + m_{\\rm sw_x}(t)+m_{\\rm sne_x}(t)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath74 is the rate of mass loss by galactic wind ( the calculation of @xmath75 is presented in the next section ) .",
    "the mass remove from the ism by the star formation process is used to generate several new stellar populations .",
    "each population is given an initial mass @xmath69 , an initial metallicity @xmath68 equal to the metallicity @xmath76 of the ism at that time , and we set the age @xmath67 of these new populations to zero .",
    "we then recompute the ism metallicity : @xmath77\\big/ m_{\\rm ism}(t+\\delta t)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this expression accounts for the material removed from the ism by the star formation process and the galactic wind , and it also considers the enriched material added by stars already formed .",
    "finally , we update the age of every stellar population : @xmath78    these operations are repeated at every timestep in the simulation .    in our model",
    ", @xmath62 is a function of time only .",
    "this assumes that metals ejected into the ism by sne and stellar winds are instantaneously mixed .",
    "this commonly - used approximation has the advantage of being simple to implement .",
    "however , in reality , it will take some finite time before the metals are fully mixed .",
    "for this reason , the efficiency of metal - enrichment of the igm in our model should be considered as an upper limit .",
    "starburst99 can not calculate directly the mass loss and luminosities appearing in equations  ( [ mejectsw ] ) to ( [ lumsn ] ) for any initial metallicity @xmath79 .",
    "it is limited to the values @xmath8 , 0.004 , 0.008 , and 0.02 .",
    "we therefore need to interpolate the results of starburst99 in order to get the quantities @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for values of @xmath79 in the range",
    "@xmath82 $ ] , we calculate @xmath80 and @xmath81 at the metallicities immediately before and after @xmath79 , and interpolate between them , using equations of the form @xmath83    in the range @xmath84 $ ] , we treat stellar winds and sne differently .",
    "we assume that , in that range , the mass loss by stellar wind is proportional to @xmath85 , with @xmath86 , as in equations  ( [ mej1 ] ) to  ( [ bmi ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath87    for sne , we use the values @xmath88 at lower metallicities .",
    "this is a valid approximation because the dependence of the stellar lifetimes on metallicity is weak , as figure  [ lum_sn ] shows .",
    "the presence of a galactic wind enables a fraction of the ism to escape the galaxy and enrich the surrounding igm .",
    "since the wind is generated by the thermal energy deposited in the ism by stars , we expect the mechanical energy of the galactic wind to be proportional to the rate of energy injection by sne and stellar winds : @xmath89    where @xmath75 and @xmath90 are the mass loss rate by galactic wind and the velocity of the wind , respectively .",
    "the galactic wind will create a cavity expanding into the igm ( see   4 below ) .",
    "the expansion of the cavity is driven by the mechanical energy @xmath91 deposited into the igm by the wind , but does not depend separately on @xmath75 and @xmath90 .",
    "hence , to determine @xmath75 , we must make an additional assumption .",
    "there are two limiting cases : one limit consists of having @xmath75 constant , in which case increasing the number of sne will increase the wind velocity .",
    "the opposite limit consists of having a constant wind velocity @xmath90 , in which case an increase in the number of sne results in a larger amount of matter being ejected",
    ".    it would take detailed high - resolution simulations to determine which of these limits is correct .",
    "ultimately , the critical factor should be the spatial distribution of sne .",
    "a single sn will only affect the ism located in its vicinity .",
    "in the case of several sne , there collective effect should critically depend on their level of clustering .",
    "if all sne are concentrated in a same location , the same region will be affected , and the net effect will be to eject the same matter , but at a larger velocity .",
    "if instead the sne are distributed throughout the galaxy , each sn will affect a different part of the ism , and the net result will be to eject more material , but at the same velocity .",
    "this last case is the limit we adopt in this paper .",
    "consequently , the reader should keep in mind that our estimates of the amount of material ejected is an upper limit . under this assumption",
    "the rate of mass loss by the galactic wind is proportional to the luminosity , @xmath92    to determine the constant of proportionality , we first integrate the functions @xmath74 and @xmath93 over the lifetime of the galaxy : @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the total mass ejected into the galactic wind , and @xmath96 is the total energy deposited in the ism .",
    "we can rewrite equation  ( [ mproptol ] ) as @xmath97    the problem is that @xmath95 and @xmath96 are not known until the simulation is completed , and to perform the simulation , we need to know these quantities _ in advance _ in order to calculate @xmath75 at every timestep .",
    "to solve this problem , we replace @xmath95 and @xmath96 in equation  ( [ wind1 ] ) by approximations that can be calculated _ ab initio _",
    ", before actually performing the simulation .",
    "the luminosity @xmath93 is calculated as the simulation proceeds , but we can estimate it as follows : first , as we shall see below , the contribution of stellar winds to the luminosity becomes negligible once the sne phase starts .",
    "if we neglect stellar winds , and also neglect the weak dependence of the sn luminosity on the metallicity ( see fig .",
    "[ lum_sn ] ) , we can directly estimate the luminosity from the star formation rate @xmath48 .",
    "we define an _ integrated mass loss rate _ @xmath98 using : @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the time elapsed between the formation of the stellar population and the onset of the first sn , and @xmath101 is the time duration of the sne phase . and",

    "the two terms in equation  ( [ pdot ] ) represent the increase in pressure caused by injection of thermal energy , and the drop in pressure caused by the expansion of the wind , respectively .    the external pressure , @xmath140 , depends upon the density and temperature of the igm . as in pmg07 , we will assume a photoheated igm made of ionized hydrogen and singly - ionized helium ( mean molecular mass @xmath143 ) , with a fixed temperature @xmath144 @xcite and an igm density equal to the mean baryon density @xmath145 . the external pressure at redshift @xmath146 is then given by : @xmath147    the luminosity @xmath138 is the rate of energy deposition or dissipation within the wind and is given by : @xmath148    where @xmath16 and @xmath13 are the total luminosity responsible for generating the wind , as given by equations  ( [ lumsn ] ) and ( [ lumsw ] ) , respectively .",
