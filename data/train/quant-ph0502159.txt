    "the study of quantum coherence and quantum interference in a atomic system has led to a variety of novel phenomena such as lasing without inversion  @xcite , absorption cancellation  @xcite , refractive index enhancement  @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency@xcite , ultra - slow  @xcite , superluminal  @xcite and even stored light  @xcite , and unprecedented control of spontaneous emission @xcite .",

    ", one can expect that there will be phase dependence involved in atomic coherence effects where more than one drive fields are used due to a relative phase difference between them .",
    "utilization of the phase dependence of atomic properties such as coherence have been proposed in the manipulation of the spontaneous emission spectra  @xcite and manipulation of the index of refraction and the group velocity of light  @xcite .",
    "phase dependent effects are fascinating due to the inherent tunability associated with them and they offer an easy to control parameter in an experiment .",
    "this tunability associated with manipulation of relative phase allows a whole range of possibilities in the spontaneous emission spectrum and group velocity manipulations .",
    "we have recently proposed a model to use phase control to obtain subluminal to superluminal light propagation in a single system  @xcite , and sub - half - wavelength localization of atom passing through a standing wave field  @xcite .",
    "it is a general understanding that one needs closed systems to obtain phase dependence .",
    "however , as our scheme uses an open system , the probe field is completely independent of the conditions needed for achieving the phase dependence .    in this article",
    "we revisit some of our recent results  @xcite to study the phase dependence of susceptibility for a weak probe applied to a specially prepared four - level atomic medium and the applications of the scheme to tunable control of the group velocity and atom localization .",
    "we first discuss our model and brief discussion of the susceptibility calculations in sec.[sec : model ] .",
    "we then discuss how a continuous change of phase gives the possibility of switching the group velocity from subluminal to superluminal and vice versa in sec.[sec : gv ] .",
    "later we discuss how the same scheme can be used for localization of atom as it moves through a cavity in sec.[sec : al ] .",
    "finally we conclude in sec.[sec : conclude ] .",

    "we consider an atom , moving in the z direction , as it passes through a classical standing - wave field of a cavity .",

    "probe field , denoted by @xmath3 , is detuned by an amount @xmath4 from the @xmath5 transition . the labels ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) used in @xmath2 and @xmath6 part of the figure correspond to the fields with rabi frequencies @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",

    "@xmath2 the schematic for the group velocity manipulation scheme .",
    "the three drive fields and the probe pulse all are taken to be co - propagating as they pass through the atomic medium .",

    "moreover , we see that there is a @xmath0 scheme ( @xmath16 ) embedded in the level scheme , which is essential for the eit type behavior that we use for our proposal .    the hamiltonian for the problem can be written as @xmath17 where the self - energy @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 and the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath20.\\ ] ] here , @xmath21 correspond to the energy of state @xmath22 ; the angular frequencies of the optical fields are denoted by @xmath23 ; and the subscript @xmath24 stands for the quantity corresponding to the probe field . for the rest of the discussion we assume the rabi frequencies @xmath25 to be real and allow @xmath9 to have a carrying phase , i.e. , @xmath26 . since the three driving fields form a closed loop the phase can be imparted to any one of them and that will not change the result of the calculation .",
    "this will come clear at a later stage .",
    "the coupling of the probe field of amplitude @xmath3 is governed by the corresponding rabi frequency @xmath27 .",

    "solution for the important density matrix element is obtained to be @xmath34 where @xmath35 , with @xmath36 now noting that the susceptibility can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the atom number density in the medium . separating the real and imaginary parts @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "it is imperative to point out that the phase enters the susceptibility expression only through quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the phase dependence of @xmath43 itself is only through that of @xmath42 .",
    "we observe that the phase dependent term in @xmath42 is @xmath44 .",
    "thus , this phase factor could very well have come from either of the three driving fields .",
    "moreover , in the event that all the fields have a carrying phase , only the collective phase would occur in the susceptibility and there would be no dependence on individual phases .",
    "this collective phase can be easily determined to be @xmath45 , by repeating the susceptibility calculation and noting that the rabi frequencies are in general complex . here",
    "@xmath46 is the phase of the complex rabi frequency @xmath47 of the @xmath48th driving field .",
    "noting the phase denendence of the atomic response to a weak probe field it can be seen that variety of effects are possible , we study two examples in the following sections .",
    "for the discussion of this section the relevant quantity to consider is the group index @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the speed of light in vacuum and the group velocity @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 note that the group velocity depends only on the real part of the susceptibility @xmath53 . however , the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility are related with each other through the kramer - krnig relations , thus careful considerations of both the quantities are needed to find proper consitions for obtaining phase control of the group velocity .",
    "we observe that our model imparts unprecedented control over the group velocity of the probe pulse .",
    "the group velocity shows continuous tunability over a wide range of values ranging from subluminal to superluminal with just the change of the phase of one of the control fields while other parameters are kept constant .",
    "important feature of our model being considerably less absorption accompanying the superluminal group velocities . except for the first experimental realization  @xcite where superluminality was gain assisted , most of the other proposals observe superluminality along with considerable absorption of the pulse as it passes through a specially prepared medium .",
    "we discuss our results with the help of the figures  [ fig : habsphaset ] , [ fig : labsphaset ] .",
    "phase variation of group velocity ( accompanied by absorption ) : the general parameters are @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "( a)@xmath56 , ( b ) @xmath57 , ( c ) @xmath58 , ( d ) @xmath59 , and ( e ) variation of group index as a function of @xmath60 .",

    ". please note that each label corresponds to both the plots appearing horizontally right to next to it . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : habsphaset ] ( a)-(d ) we plot the susceptibility ( @xmath61 ) and the group index ( @xmath65 ) as we vary the phase ( @xmath60 ) of the field corresponding to the rabi frequency @xmath9 .",
    "we observe appearance and disappearance of a peak in the absorption profile in the center near ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "thus there is resulting change in the sign of the slope of the dispersion with the phase giving rise to switch in the group velocity of the probe pulse from subluminal to superluminal .",
    "this change is continuous as depicted in fig.[fig : habsphaset ] ( e ) . in this choice of parameters",
    "one has superluminality accompanied by slight absorption .",
    "note that we have chosen a modest value of the frequency of the probe field @xmath67 .",
    "the derivative term being the dominating one in the group index , for real experimental parameters we expect the range of variation of the group velocity to be much larger than shown here .",
    "we note that in all the figures to follow , susceptibility @xmath61 and the group index @xmath68 are plotted in the units of @xmath63 . also , detuning @xmath4",
    "is represented by its dimensionless equivalent @xmath64 and the phase @xmath60 is in radians .",
    "however , it would be desirable to have superluminal propagation with reduced absorption to make sure that the pulse is not attenuated considerably as it passes through the medium .",
    "we consider a different range of parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : labsphaset ] that gives us essentially the same feature . to illustrate , we observe that the susceptibility has a small feature near the line center ( @xmath69 ) as shown in part ( d ) of the figure .",
    "we concentrate on this small feature and take advantage of the fact that the absorption is small to show phase tuning of the group velocity in parts ( a)-(c ) .",
    "it turns out that having the probe field slightly detuned from the probe transition gives a wider range of group velocities ( parts ( a ) and ( c ) ) compared to zero detuning ( part ( b ) ) .",
    "it is also instructive to notice that even though we are focusing on a small spectral feature of the medium the range of the group velocities available is no less than that observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : habsphaset ] .",
    "phase variation of group velocity ( small absorption ) : the general parameters are @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "( a)@xmath72 , ( b ) @xmath73 , ( c ) @xmath74 , ( d ) variation as a function of @xmath64 for @xmath56 .",
    "we concentrate on the small feature near @xmath69 in the susceptibility curves to obtain ( a)-(c ) .",
    "this small feature seen in ( d ) is magnified and depicted in ( e ) .",
    "thus have superluminality at a considerably less absorption compared to most of the existing proposals .",
    "another point to be noted here is that large variation of group velocity is available for @xmath75 but close to @xmath76 .",
    "the units are the same as in fig .  2 .",
    "]    now we contrast some of the features of the above considered model with some other approaches .",
    "a desirable feature in the group velocity control is intensity dependent tunability , demonstrated by agarwal _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "our model has this feature as well and shows the intensity controlled tuning of the group velocity  @xcite .",
    "most of the proposals for the tunability of the group velocity are affected adversely due to the doppler broadening of the medium . as pointed out by goren _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite the tunability from subluminal to superluminal is lost completely due to the doppler broadening effects in some cases .",
    "it is however instructive to note that the model we propose here is naturally doppler free if we consider all the drive fields and the probe field to be propagating colinearly . to put this in perspective",
    "we note that the major requirements of our model constitute maintaining the loop formed by the three driving fields and the two - photon resonance condition of eit among the driving field @xmath7 and the probe field .",
    "we note that since @xmath77 , the doppler shifts for collinear propagation would satisfy @xmath78 maintaining the loop structure and phase sensitivity . with the assumption that the low lying levels @xmath79 and @xmath33 are very close to each other the frequency shift in the driving field corresponding to @xmath7 and the probe field are nearly the same thus maintaining the two - photon resonance with the transition @xmath80 . within the two - photon resonance regime ,",
    "the only requirement for keeping the eit medium doppler free is to have sufficiently strong driving field  @xcite .",
    "thus , noting that we work very close to the eit condition our model is naturally doppler free and there is very little absorption of any of the fields shining on the medium .",
    "moreover , the model maintains the phase sensitivity as it preserves the loop structure even with the doppler shifts .    in the next section we present another application of the phase dependence of the susceptibility of a weak probe field for atom localization",
    "for the purpose of the discussion for this section we concern ourselves only with the imaginary part of the susceptibility which is given as @xmath81 however , the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath82 are modified because the field @xmath83 now corresponds to the standing - wave field of the cavity as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](c ) .",
    "therefore the rabi frequency @xmath7 is to be replaced by @xmath84 .",
    "thus the new definitions of the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath82 are given by @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "in the next section we consider the imaginary part of the susceptibility @xmath87 in detail and obtain various conditions for sub - wavelength localization of the atom .",
    "we study the expression   for the imaginary part of the susceptibility on the probe transition in greater details in the following discussion .",
    "it is clear that @xmath87 , i.e. , probe absorption depends on the controllable parameters of the system like probe field detuning , amplitudes and phases of the driving fields .    noting the dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath88",
    ", we can see that it is , in principle , possible to obtain information about the @xmath89position of the atom as it passes through the cavity by measuring the probe absorption .",
    "nevertheless , for precise localization of the atom the susceptibility should show maxima or peaks along the @xmath89coordinate .",
    "we obtain the conditions for the presence of peaks in @xmath87 in the discussion to follow . in the case of @xmath90 ,",
    "i.e. , the level @xmath91 is a metastable eq",
    ".   can be simplified as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93}\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] thus peaks will occur in @xmath87 at @xmath89positions satisfying @xmath94 . in other words , @xmath87 peaks at the spatial positions defined by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is an integer , leading to localization of atoms conditioned on the detection of the probe absorption at that particular frequency corresponding to the value of @xmath4 . in general , there will be four distinct peaks spread over the whole wavelength as both the roots @xmath97 appear twice in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiroot ] ) .",
    "as already discussed , the positions of maxima are strongly dependent on the probe field frequency through its detuning @xmath4 .",
    "one of the main requirement for obtaining the novel result we mentioned in the introduction , namely sub - half - wavelength localization of the atom , would be to reduce the usual four peaks to two and to confine them to one of the half - wavelength regions along t he standing - wave of the cavity . once again observing expression  ( [ eq : chiroot ] ) for the probe absorption we can see that two peaks are possible only if @xmath98 and @xmath99 coincide .",
    "this gives rise to the condition @xmath100=0 $ ] . to simplify the discussion we consider a special case when @xmath101",
    "this assumption is general enough and easy to realize as the drive field strengths are controllable .",
    "this condition can be solved for @xmath4 with @xmath102 to obtain @xmath103 for brevity we have introduced the notation , @xmath104 , for the interesting values of the detunings .",
    "we plot the susceptibility in arbitrary units versus the @xmath105 in figs .",
    "[ fig : plots2 ] and  [ fig : plots3 ] for the detunings @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively for the different values of the cavity field phase @xmath108 for the choice of the drive field rabi frequencies such that the localization peaks are sharp and well within a half - wavelength when sub - localization occurs .",
    "another interesting value of the detuning should be looked at as well corresponding to the phase value @xmath57 , to check if there is a possibility of reducing the number of peaks from four to two in this case as well .",
    "in fact , it can be seen that one can obtain @xmath109 for @xmath57 by solving , @xmath110=0 $ ] for @xmath4 .",
    "thus , with @xmath101 we obtain @xmath111 it can be easily seen that for these values of @xmath112 there is no sub - half - wavelength localization possible .",

    "[ fig : plots2 ] due to larger value of @xmath133 . ]    to clarify conditions to obtain good localization peaks well - within the half - wavelength region of the cavity field we remind ourselves us that the sub - half - wavelength localization occurs when @xmath109 , i.e. when @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "note that the @xmath144 sign corresponds to @xmath56 and @xmath145 corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "thus the base peak occurs either the left or right side of @xmath146 depending on the value of the phase @xmath60 .",

    "@xcite we have distinct advantage to offer as the absorption measurements are straightforward to realize in an experiment compared to the measurement of spontaneous emission spectrum . in the following section",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we have studied an extended @xmath0type scheme and have demonstrated appearance of phase dependence in the response of the atomic medium to a weak probe field .",
    "we have further investigated application of the scheme to two situations one concerning the group velocity of the probe field and another allowing sub - wavelength localization of a moving atom .",
    "the model shows a wide range of tunability in the group velocity of the probe field just by changing the phase of one of the control fields .",
    "the group velocity can also be switched from subluminal to superluminal through a continuous change of the phase .",
    "in contrast with most of the proposals where superluminality is accompanied with considerable absorption , we can reduce the absorption of the probe pulse substantially .",
    "the model imparts control of the propagation properties of the probe pulse by controlling the intensities of the laser fields as well .",
    "in addition , the model imparts natural doppler - free situation when all the fields are propagating in a collinear fashion . moreover , we work within the eit domain thus with sufficiently strong drive fields one does not have to worry about the absorption of any of the fields incident on the medium .    by taking one of the drive fields as a standing - wave field of a cavity",
    "we can use our model for sub - wavelength localization of the atom as it passes through the standing - wave .",
    "measurement of absorption of the probe field at a particular frequency localizes the atom .",
    "we have shown that the precision of the position measurement of the atom depends upon the amplitudes and the relative phase of the driving fields .",
    "the amplitude of standing - wave driving field when increased leads to line narrowing in the probe absorption , thus giving increased precision in the position measurement . whereas the relative phase of the fields has important role in reducing the number of localization peaks leading to sub - half - wavelength localization , namely confinement of the localization peaks to one of the half - wavelength regions of the cavity field . as the method",
    "is based on the measurement of the probe absorption , it has two distinct advantages compared to the similar methods based on the observation of the spontaneous emission spectrum .",
    "absorption measurements are much easier to perform in a laboratory compared to monitoring of spontaneous emission spectrum .",
    "moreover , we do not require the atoms to be prepared in their excited states , in fact they are prepared in their natural ground state .",

    "<S> we show that , by simple modifications of the usual three - level @xmath0-type scheme used for obtaining electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , phase dependence in the response of the atomic medium to a weak probe field can be introduced . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to phase dependent susceptibility . by properly controlling phase and amplitudes of the drive fields we obtain variety of interesting effects . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand we obtain phase control of the group velocity of a probe field passing through medium to the extent that continuous tuning of the group velocity from subluminal to superluminal and back is possible . while on the other hand , by choosing one of the drive fields to be a standing wave field inside a cavity , we obtain sub - wavelength localization of moving atoms passing through the cavity field . </S>"
