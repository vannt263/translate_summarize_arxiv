    "present - day cosmological structure is thought to have formed by the gravitational amplification of small density perturbations .",
    "these fluctuations are readily quantified in terms of their fourier modes via the power spectrum , which is a statistically complete description for a gaussian field .",
    "the power spectrum is also of direct physical interest , because it encodes information about the formation of the primordial fluctuations , and especially about how these are modified according to the matter content of the universe .    in this paper , we present an estimate of the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) . the 2dfgrs is designed around the 2df multi - fibre spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope , which is capable of obtaining spectra for up to 400 objects simultaneously over a 2 degree diameter field of view .",
    "full details of the instrument and its performance are given in lewis et  al .",
    "see also http://www.aao.gov.au/2df/. the survey aims to obtain redshifts for @xmath5 galaxies to an extinction - corrected magnitude limit of @xmath6 . a description of the survey , with preliminary results ,",
    "is given by colless ( 1999 ) ; full details of the present status can be obtained from http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dfgrs/.    at the time of writing , the 2dfgrs is the largest existing galaxy redshift survey , following a natural progression from studies such as the cfa survey ( huchra et  al .  1990 ) , the lcrs ( shectman et  al .  1996 ) , and the pscz survey ( saunders et  al .",
    "the data and analysis presented in this paper covers the sample with @xmath7 redshifts observed prior to february 2001 .",
    "a sample of this size allows large - scale structure statistics to be measured with very small random errors , and we present an initial power - spectrum analysis of the 2dfgrs here .",
    "section 2 details some of the practical issues concerning sample selection , and section 3 discusses power - spectrum estimation .",
    "the survey coverage in angular position and redshift is relatively complex , and the convolving effects of the survey window are significant compared to the small random errors .",
    "these effects are therefore studied in some detail , both analytically and in comparison to mock data , in section 4 .",
    "this leads to a robust estimate of the covariance matrix for the estimates of the power at different wavenumbers , which is presented in section 5 .",
    "the covariance matrix allows proper likelihood - based model fitting , which is carried out in section 6 .",
    "the power - spectrum fits clearly indicate a low - density universe with @xmath8 , in agreement with many past studies .",
    "we also show that the preferred model requires a degree of baryon oscillations in the power spectrum , corresponding to a baryonic fraction of about 15% .",
    "we conclude by considering the consistency between this picture and other lines of evidence .",
    "when complete , the angular geometry of the 2dfgrs will consist of two declination strips plus 100 random 2-degree fields .",
    "one strip is near the southern galactic pole ( sgp ) and covers approximately 85@xmath9@xmath1015@xmath9 ; the other strip is near the northern galactic pole ( ngp ) and covers 75@xmath9@xmath1010@xmath9 .",
    "these strips are not coplanar , which is a significant factor in using the survey to measure 3d structure .",
    "the 100 random fields are spread uniformly over the 7000  deg@xmath11 region of the apm catalogue near the sgp ; the present analysis includes 71 of these fields .",
    "the input catalogue is a revised and extended version of the apm galaxy catalogue ( maddox et  al .",
    "1990a , b , c,1996 ) .",
    "this includes over 5 million galaxies down to @xmath12 over @xmath13deg@xmath11 .",
    "the apm catalogue was used previously to recover the 3d power spectrum of galaxies by inverting the appropriate integral equations ( baugh & efstathiou 1993 ; efstathiou & moody 2000 ) .",
    "however , these techniques are demanding in sample variance and photometric uniformity , and we expect that a fully 3d analysis should yield a more robust result .    an adaptive tiling algorithm is employed to cover the survey area with a minimum number of overlapping 2df fields . with this algorithm",
    "we are able to achieve a 93% sampling rate with on average fewer than 5% wasted fibres per field . over the whole area of the survey",
    "there are in excess of @xmath5 galaxies . at the present intermediate stage of the survey ,",
    "unobserved fields mean that the proportion of targets with known redshifts is a strongly varying function of position .",
    "in addition , regions around bright stars are omitted , so the 2dfgrs angular mask is a complicated pattern on the sky ( see e.g. colless 1999 ) .",
    "nevertheless , because the tiling algorithm is known , it is possible to generate random catalogues that are subject to the same selection effects .",
    "a number of different codes have been written to achieve this task , with consistent results . furthermore , because a 3d power spectrum analysis averages over directions , small imperfections in reproducing the sky pattern of the real data tend to wash out .",
    "for example , we tried adding magnitude offset errors of @xmath14 in each @xmath15 schmidt field , but the power spectrum did not change significantly .",
    "given the sampling pattern on the sky , there are two possible analysis strategies : one can either build a similar variation into any random catalogue , or the analysis can use a uniform random catalogue , weighting each galaxy by the reciprocal of the sampling . the former strategy is superior in terms of shot noise , but the latter is necessary if the mask is correlated with real structure ( e.g. fibre crowding problems in high - density regions ) .",
    "we obtain almost identical results with either strategy , demonstrating that the adaptive tiling has achieved its target of uniform selection of targets .",
    "the sample is chosen to be magnitude - limited at @xmath16 after extinction - correcting all the magnitudes in the apm catalogue ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "this limit was chosen because the mean number of galaxies per square degree then matches the density of fibres available with 2df .",
    "the resulting distribution of galaxy redshifts @xmath17 has a median of approximately 0.11 , and can be fitted by @xmath18^{1+\\beta}}\\;dz ,      \\label{eq : nz}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 & @xmath21 are fitted parameters .",
    "fitting to all of the galaxy redshifts gives @xmath22 , @xmath23 & @xmath24 .",
    "however , the redshift distribution is expected to vary with position on the sky , because the survey depth is not completely uniform .",
    "this arises because the spectroscopic success rate is a function of apparent magnitude : data from poorer nights are biased to brighter objects , and thus to lower redshifts .",
    "also , our estimates of galactic extinction and ccd calibration of the zero points of the individual photographic plates have been revised since the original input catalogue was defined .",
    "all these effects contribute to a modulation of the depth of the survey , which is accounted for when making the random catalogue that defines the survey volume .",
    "because these estimates of nonuniformity can never be quite precise , we have chosen to allow the parameters of the @xmath25 fit to be different in distinct zones of the sky , treating the ngp , sgp , and random fields separately .",
    "analysis of mock catalogues shows that this makes only a small difference to the power estimates at @xmath26 , which we use as our normal analysis limit .",
    "following the fft - based approach of feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 ; fkp ) , each galaxy in the sample was placed onto a @xmath27 grid , scaled to cover the entire sample in each direction .",
    "the size of the cuboid that just contains all of the data to a redshift limit at @xmath28 is @xmath29 , assuming a flat @xmath30 cosmology .",
    "the grid used therefore leads to approximately equal nyquist frequencies in each direction . for this grid",
    ", @xmath31  corresponds to a conservative @xmath32 of the minimum nyquist frequency . comparing with results obtained using different size grids",
    "also suggests that aliasing is not a problem for frequencies @xmath33 , although , of course , it will affect the result at large @xmath1 . as shown by fkp ,",
    "the galaxies must be weighted in order to optimize the balance between cosmic variance and shot noise .",
    "assuming that the fluctuations are gaussian , the optimal fkp weight is @xmath34},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the expected galaxy density .",
    "a value of @xmath36 was assumed , but this is not critical . for a high - density sample like the 2dfgrs , one very nearly gives equal weight to each volume element , independent of @xmath37 .",
    "we applied an upper redshift limit of @xmath28 , to remove regions with a very low galaxy density where the choice of @xmath37 would matter .",
    "we also defined a lower limit of @xmath38 .",
    "with restriction to objects with redshift quality flag @xmath39 , this leaves a sample of @xmath40 objects .    in order to transform from redshifts to distances in @xmath41",
    "we need to assume values for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "strictly , when fitting models to the data we should alter these values to match the model . however , the power spectrum is only weakly dependent on this choice : we have tried both an einstein - de sitter cosmology and a flat @xmath30 cosmology and find approximately the same best fit model parameters ( see table  [ tab : fit_data ] ) . normally , we will present results for a flat @xmath30 cosmology .    before fourier transforming the data , we need to convert from a distribution of galaxies to a distribution of overdensities . to do this ,",
    "the survey volume was defined by a random catalogue that mimics the sampling of the original data . in order to create such a sample ,",
    "we have used the known angular position and completeness of each field ( described in section  [ sec : angular_mask ] ) , coupled with an empirically determined fit to the redshift distribution of the 2dfgrs catalogue ( described in section  [ sec : nz ] ) .",
    "the variations in observing conditions , and the corresponding spectroscopic success rate , mean that there are in practice variations in the survey depth with sky position .",
    "these are allowed for by appropriate perturbations of the redshift distribution in the random catalogue , although this again turns out to be an unimportant effect .",
    "the random catalogue we created had 5 times the number of points in the galaxy catalogue .",
    "having fourier transformed the resulting overdensity field , we simply subtracted the shot noise contribution from the result , and re - normalized @xmath44 in order to correct for a differing sample volume and fft volume , and to correct for the weighting ( fkp equations 2.1.3 and 2.1.10 ) .",
    "@xmath44 was then spherically averaged over @xmath1-space shells .",
    "the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution needs to be interpreted with care , as it is altered from that of the initial density fluctuations ( the linear power spectrum ) by a number of effects :    the collapse of structures .",
    "the mass no longer obeys the linear power spectrum on small scales after it has undergone non - linear collapse .",
    "galaxies are not expected to form a poisson sampling of the underlying mass fluctuations , and are biased with respect to this distribution .",
    "random oscillations of galaxies within larger collapsed objects causes ` fingers of god ' redshift space distortions that damp estimates of the small - scale power .",
    "the infall of galaxies into concentrations of mass on large scales ( kaiser 1987 ) enhances the observed power in the radial direction , creating a large - scale redshift distortion .",
    "additionally , the recovered power spectrum estimated using the fkp approach is the convolution of the galaxy power spectrum with the ` window function ' @xmath45 of the survey ( @xmath46 being the fourier transform of the product of the survey mask and redshift selection function times @xmath47 ; see fkp equation 2.1.7 ) : @xmath48 in section  [ sec : window ] we show how we may model the effect of the window function , by convolving power spectra with an analytic fit to the spherically averaged window function , and empirically by analysing realizations of gaussian density fields within the survey region .",
    "the inverse problem of deconvolving the window function from the power spectra is not attempted in this work .",
    "the 2dfgrs window function @xmath45 is not compact , and has a significant effect on the recovered power spectrum .",
    "although @xmath46 is anisotropic due to the complicated real space selection function , we are normally interested in the spherical average of the final power spectrum over @xmath1-space shells .",
    "therefore , if @xmath49 is isotropic , we obtain the same result by convolving just with the spherical average of @xmath45 . a good approximation to the averaged window",
    "is @xmath50^{-1}.      \\label{eq : win_fit}\\ ] ] this fit is compared to the exact 2dfgrs window in fig .",
    "[ fig : win ] .",
    "the potential cause of problems is the tail to high @xmath1 .",
    "the convolution involves a normalization factor @xmath51 . in this respect ,",
    "the 2dfgrs window is quite like an adaptive - optics psf .    of course , redshift - space distortions mean that the true power spectrum will not be strictly isotropic in practice .",
    "however , the simulation results described below suggest that the effect of such deviations are small and do not have a significant impact on the recovered power spectrum .    in order to demonstrate the effect of this window function on power spectra , we have sampled realizations of a linear density field covering the volume of the 2dfgrs data .",
    "averaging the results of this analysis for 1000 realizations with different phases , and comparing with the true input power spectrum , we can quantify the effect of the window function .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : win_pow ] for spectra corresponding to two different cosmologies .",
    "the shape of the spectra are significantly altered , and any oscillations are damped . analytically convolving the power spectra with the fit to the window function given by equation  [ eq : win_fit ] provides the same result .    because the random catalogue is scaled to match the normalization of the galaxy catalogue , the average overdensity is artificially set to zero , forcing @xmath52 .",
    "this self - normalization results in a deficit in the measured power spectrum equivalent to subtracting a scaled copy of the window function , centred on @xmath53 . however , this is a very small effect in the regime of interest because @xmath45 is a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : win ] ) , and @xmath54 is expected to be an increasing function of @xmath1 for small @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of this self - normalization is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : win_pow ] for model power spectra .      the recovered 2dfgrs power spectrum is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] . to highlight features in the spectra presented in this paper ,",
    "we have plotted their ratio with a smooth cdm power spectrum @xmath55 that has no baryon features .",
    "we also take a normalization of @xmath56 for this reference model .",
    "all of the power spectra used in this paper are calculated using the transfer function fitting formulae of eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) and assume a scale - invariant primordial spectrum unless stated otherwise .",
    "we have parametrized the model power spectra explicitly by @xmath57 in order to avoid confusion with differing definitions of the commonly used shape parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the raw results are gratifyingly accurate , with fractional errors in the power of only @xmath59 out to @xmath60 . to within about 20% , the observed spectral shape is that of the @xmath55 reference model between @xmath61 . at smaller scales ,",
    "the finger - of - god redshift - space smearing is clearly seen to reduce the power . in many ways ,",
    "the most striking features are the suggestions of oscillatory modulations , with a possible peak at @xmath62 and possible troughs at @xmath63 and @xmath64 . however ,",
    "it is clear that the window function has caused adjacent power estimates to be closely correlated , so a proper covariance analysis is required before any significance can be given to these apparent features .",
    "given the precision of the basic power estimates , it is necessary to attain an accurate measure of the systematic effects listed above that modify the shape of the spectrum .",
    "we achieve this in the next section by using mock data .",
    "redshift - space and non - linear effects mean that the shape of the recovered power spectrum gives information about the linear power spectrum only at small values of @xmath1 .",
    "the easiest way to model both these effects is via numerical simulation . using an empirically motivated biasing scheme , it is possible to place galaxies within @xmath65-body simulations and provide mock catalogues designed to mimic the 2dfgrs catalogue for different cosmological models ( cole et  al .",
    "1998 ; baugh et  al .  2001 ) . in this section",
    "we use these mock catalogues to demonstrate that for @xmath66  the only important effect on the power spectrum is the convolution with the window function .",

    "the redshift - space and non - linear effects cancel to some extent and give approximately the correct level of @xmath54 out to @xmath70 .",

    "allowing the normalization to vary removes any large - scale constant bias ; the bias is not expected theoretically to vary significantly with @xmath1 on these large scales ( kauffmann , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ; benson et  al .",

    ", measurements of @xmath72 from redshift - space distortions as a function of scale will test directly the degree to which this is true ( see peacock et  al .",
    "2001 for the first 2dfgrs results on redshift - space distortions ) .",
    "this region of the power spectrum therefore directly provides information about the shape of the linear power spectrum , and can be used with models of the transfer function to provide constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "although this conclusion has only been justified here for two specific assumed models , we have performed similar tests on a wider range of models . in table 1 below , we show explicitly how the results depend on the range of wavenumber considered .",
    "the @xmath54 data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] are not independent , and correlations extend across finite regions of @xmath1-space .",
    "this is predominantly caused by the convolution with the window function , although there is also a contribution from non - linear effects ( meiksin & white 1999 ; scoccimarro , zaldarriaga & hui 1999 ) and redshift - space effects .",
    "particular care must therefore be taken in interpreting ` wiggles ' in the power spectrum as significant features . in order to quantify these correlations ,",
    "we have estimated the covariance matrix for the data points with @xmath66 .",
    "a large number of independent realizations of @xmath54 are required in order to have sufficient signal - to - noise in the covariance matrix .",

    "instead , we have created 1000 realizations of a gaussian random field on a @xmath73 grid covering the region of the 2dfgrs survey . for @xmath66 , using a smaller grid than that used for the 2dfgrs data does not significantly affect the result , and reduces the computational burden .",
    "the resulting power spectra , determined as for the 2dfgrs data , were used in section  [ sec : window ] to demonstrate the effect of convolving @xmath54 by the window function .",
    "these realizations provide an estimate of the cosmic variance within the 2dfgrs volume .",
    "the contribution from shot noise has been calculated by analysing similar monte - carlo realizations , and has been included in our estimate of the covariance matrix .",
    "estimating the covariance matrix in this way does not take into account non - linear and redshift - space effects , which add to the covariances .",
    "however , these effects should be small over the region of @xmath1-space we are fitting . as a test of this",
    "we have estimated the covariance matrix using 10 catalogues drawn from @xmath74 @xmath75 cdm simulations with different phases by cole et  al .",
    "these catalogues were calculated using cole et  al.(1998 ) bias model  1 .",
    "the correlations calculated over the @xmath1-space region @xmath76  were similar in scale to those calculated from the gaussian fields .",
    "however , we find that the errors in @xmath54 calculated from numerical simulations are @xmath77% larger than those determined from gaussian simulations , although there is no evidence for a change in shape of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix for @xmath66",
    ". we do see a change at @xmath78 consistent with non - linear and redshift - space effects , which are expected to be an increasing function of @xmath1 . in this work",
    "we adopt the conservative approach and renormalize the covariance matrix calculated from the gaussian realisations to match the normalisation of the numerical simulations , whilst keeping the correlation matrix the same .",
    "this renormalization does not significantly affect the primary results of this paper : the derived best - fit parameters are the same with or without this renormalization .",
    "model power spectra for different cosmologies have been created to compare with the 2dfgrs data using the transfer function fitting formulae of eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) .",

    "this gives us confidence that the quoted errors for the best - fit parameters derived from the 2dfgrs data are sound .",
    "combining the likelihood surfaces calculated from the 13 non - overlapping catalogues results in best - fit parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 , with @xmath115 for the combined likelihood .",
    "this offset is statistically acceptable , and suggests that , if there is a systematic bias in determining @xmath79 and @xmath81 from these catalogues , it is at a level well below the errors on the recovered parameters from any single catalogue .",
    "we have shown that the present 2dfgrs data allow the galaxy power spectrum to be measured to high accuracy ( 1015% rms ) over about a decade in scale at @xmath66 .",
    "we have carried out a range of tests for systematics in the analysis and a detailed comparison with realistic mock samples . as a result , we are confident that the 2dfgrs result can be interpreted as giving the shape of the linear - theory matter power spectrum on these large scales , and that the statistical errors and covariances between the data points are known .    by fitting our results to the space of cdm models ,",
    "we have been able to reach a number of interesting conclusions regarding the matter content of the universe :    the power spectrum is close in shape to that of a @xmath93 model , to a tolerance of about 20% .    nevertheless , there is sufficient structure in the @xmath54 data that the degeneracy between @xmath81 and @xmath79 is weakly broken .",
    "the two local likelihood maxima have @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively .",
    "the evidence for detection of baryon oscillations in the power spectrum is presently modest , with a likelihood ratio of approximately @xmath118 between the favoured model and the best zero - baryon model .",
    "conversely , a large baryon fraction can be very strongly excluded : @xmath119 at 95% confidence , provided @xmath120 .",
    "these conclusions do not depend strongly on the value of @xmath80 , although they do depend on the tilt of the primordial spectrum , with @xmath105 being required to make a zero - baryon model an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "the sensitivity to tilt emphasizes that the baryon signal comes in good part from the overall shape of the spectrum .",
    "although the eye is struck by a single sharp ` spike ' at @xmath62 , the correlated nature of the errors in the @xmath54 estimate means that such features tend not to be significant in isolation .",
    "we note that the convolving effects of the window would require a very substantial spike in the true power in order to match our data exactly .",
    "such over - fitting is not possible within the compass of conventional models , and the conservative conclusion is that the apparent spike is probably enhanced by correlated noise .",
    "a proper statistical treatment is essential in such cases .",
    "it is interesting to compare these conclusions with other constraints . averaging the results of netterfield et  al .",
    "2001 and pryke et  al .",
    "2001 , the current cmb data require @xmath121 , @xmath122 , together with a power - spectrum index of @xmath123 , on the assumption of pure scalar fluctuations .",
    "if we take @xmath100 , this gives @xmath124 in remarkably good agreement with the estimate from the 2dfgrs @xmath101 latest estimates of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio in qso spectra combined with big - bang nucleosynthesis theory predict @xmath125 ( omeara et  al .",
    "2001 ) , in agreement with the latest cmb results .",
    "the confidence interval estimated from the 2dfgrs power spectrum overlaps both regions .",
    "x - ray cluster analysis predicts a baryon fraction @xmath126 ( evrard 1997 ) which is again within @xmath127 of our preferred value .",
    "the above limits are all shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : powfit2 ] , and paint a picture of impressive consistency : it appears that we live in a universe that has @xmath128 with a baryon fraction of approximately @xmath129 .",
    "the precision of this statement will improve greatly with completion of the 2dfgrs .",
    "doubling the sample size will improve the errors on the baryon fraction by much more than @xmath130 .",
    "the window function will be more compact , so the signatures of baryon oscillations should be seen very clearly  or we will see that some non - standard alternative is required .",
    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey was made possible through the dedicated efforts of the staff of the anglo - australian observatory , both in creating the 2df instrument and in supporting it on the telescope .",
