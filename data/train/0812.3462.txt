    "in studying nonspherical vacuum gravitational fields , cylindrically symmetric systems have the advantages of being essentially 1 + 1 dimensional , and , unlike the spherical case , possessing a dynamical degree of freedom in gravity , i.e. , gravitational waves .",
    "solutions in this system are discussed in  @xcite and are called einstein - rosen waves .",
    "these have played an important part in the history of gravitational wave research , principally in elucidating the reality of gravitational waves as carriers of energy  @xcite .",
    "thus , several researchers have studied vacuum and nonvacuum cylindrical systems in an attempt to clarify the nature of ( especially ) nonspherical gravitational collapse , in a system that involves the essential nonlinearity of the gravitational field and the emission of gravitational waves but requires the analysis of partial differential equations with just one spatial dimension .",
    "see for example  @xcite .    as in many other fundamental theories",
    ", self - similarity plays an important role in gravitation .",
    "this importance is encapsulated in carr s self - similarity hypothesis  @xcite , which originally asserts that in the cosmological context , spherically symmetric solutions of einstein s equations evolve to a self - similar form .",
    "this evolution can be towards either an intermediate or an endstate .",
    "later it was found that this is actually the case in gravitational collapse .",
    "examples include the collapse of a soft fluid sphere  @xcite and critical phenomena emerging in the spherical collapse of a variety of matter fields  @xcite .",
    "we should also note that spatially homogeneous cosmological models provide an example of tendency towards self - similar solutions in non spherically symmetric systems : see  @xcite for a review .",
    "spherically symmetric self - similar spacetimes have been extensively studied and are now well understood .",
    "a natural next step therefore is to consider the role of self - similarity in cylindrical systems .",
    "these arise as a special case of @xmath1 spacetimes ",
    "i.e.  spacetimes admitting a two - dimensional group of isometries , usually but not always abelian .",
    "there have been several studies of self - similar @xmath1 _ cosmological _ models  again see  @xcite , but there has been little work heretofore on the role of self - similarity in cylindrical collapse . indeed it is generally true that in the cylindrical case , results are fewer and farther between : the additional degrees of freedom that exist in the cylindrical case , which render the systems of equations encountered considerably more difficult , have not to date allowed the development of as clear a picture as we have in the spherical case ( but see  @xcite ) .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "@xcite deals with self - similar cylindrical dust collapse .",
    "the present work seeks to increase our understanding of the role of self - similarity in cylindrical gravitational collapse , and the veracity of the similarity hypothesis in this context .",
    "in particular , this work is motivated by numerical results obtained by two of the present authors ( kn and th ) and their collaborators which show that self - similar cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions appear to describe the asymptotic behavior of the ( numerically obtained ) gravitational field outside a collapsing hollow dust cylinder  @xcite .",
    "we present here a two - parameter family of self - similar _ vacuum _ solutions in cylindrical symmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present formulations for vacuum spacetimes and self - similar spacetimes in the so - called whole - cylinder symmetry independently . in sec .",
    "iii , we solve the einstein field equations for vacuum self - similar spacetimes and obtain exact solutions .",
    "the motivation for this is to twofold .",
    "first , we wish to study self - similar cylindrical collapse of pure gravitational waves , as representing the simplest example of self - similar cylindrical collapse .",
    "the hope is that in some sense , this would provide the standard model for self - similar cylindrical collapse in the same way that the schwarzschild solution provides the standard model of the ( endstate of ) spherically symmetric collapse .",
    "the second motivation is to determine the description of possible exteriors of collapsing self - similar , cylindrical matter .",
    "we recall also the overarching motivation for this study : to determine self - similar solutions that may act as ( intermediate ) attractors of more general cylindrically symmetric spacetimes . in fact we show that einstein - rosen waves with a homothetic vector orthogonal to the cylinders of symmetry are _ flat _ and reduce to part of the minkowski spacetime with or without a conical singularity and with or without nontrivial topology .",
    "moreover , we show that the above metric form of part of the minkowski spacetime implies nontrivial ( i.e.  nonzero ) @xmath0 energy  @xcite and a trapping horizon . in sec .",
    "iv , we naturally extend the solutions to more general class and find that these solutions are also self - similar where the homothetic vector is not orthogonal to the cylinders of symmetry in general .",
    "we consider the analytical extension of the solutions , analyze the global structure of the obtained spacetimes and find that these describe interesting nonlinear dynamics of gravitational waves .",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation of these solutions . in sec .",
    "v , we summarize the paper .",
    "we use the units , in which @xmath2 .",
    "for cylindrically symmetric spacetimes , we assume that there are two commuting , spatial killing vectors @xmath3 such that the orthogonal space is integrable and the killing coordinate @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , is identified at @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we call @xmath8 and @xmath9 azimuthal and translational killing vectors , respectively . here",
    "we shall additionally assume that each of the two killing vectors be hypersurface orthogonal , which is called whole - cylinder symmetry  @xcite or the polarized case  @xcite .",
    "the circumferential radius @xmath10 , the specific length @xmath11 and the areal radius @xmath12 are defined as @xmath13 note then that @xmath12 is the areal radius of the orbits of the isometry group and so @xmath14 with @xmath15 at the axis .",
    "the line element in this class of spacetimes is given by  @xcite : @xmath16 we note that this form of the line element is unchanged under rescalings of the null coordinates @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the regular axis condition  @xcite ensures the ratio of an infinitesimal circle around the axis to its diameter to be @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath0 energy @xmath20 is then defined as  @xcite @xmath21 this quantity is assumed to represent the line energy density enclosed inside the cylinder . a cylinder , which is a two - surface given by @xmath22const and @xmath23const , is said to be trapped , marginally trapped and untrapped if @xmath24 is timelike , null and spacelike , respectively . in terms of the @xmath0 energy , a cylinder",
    "is trapped , marginally trapped and untrapped if @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "a cylindrical trapping horizon is a hypersurface foliated by marginal cylinders .",
    "the einstein equations @xmath28 reduce to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the stress - energy tensor for the matter fields .      here",
    "we consider vacuum spacetimes in whole - cylinder symmetry .",
    "solutions of the field equations in this case are called einstein - rosen waves  @xcite . for such a cylindrically symmetric vacuum spacetime , in which the line element is given by eq .  ( [ eq : metric_cylindrical ] ) , eq .  ( [ eq : einstein_uv ] ) reduces to @xmath31 implying @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are arbitrary functions .",
    "if @xmath24 is spacelike , we can choose @xmath33 and @xmath34 by rescaling @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that @xmath37 introducing the time and radial coordinates @xmath38 we obtain the metric in the form @xmath39 we note that this line element , subject to the einstein equations below , corresponds to the original einstein - rosen waves .",
    "that is , the einstein - rosen paper @xcite deals exclusively with the case where @xmath40 is spacelike . for convenience",
    ", we will use the term to refer to any vacuum whole - cylinder symmetric solution of the einstein equations .",
    "the nontrivial components of the einstein equations become the following simple set of partial differential equations : @xmath41 equation  ( [ eq : einstein_pp ] ) is automatically satisfied due to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gammax_spacelike ] ) and ( [ eq : gammat_spacelike ] ) .",
    "the regular axis condition reduces to @xmath42 as @xmath43 in this coordinate system .",
    "if @xmath24 is timelike , we can choose @xmath33 and @xmath34 by rescaling @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that @xmath44 then , we get the metric in the form @xmath45 the nontrivial components of the einstein equations become the following simple set of ordinary differential equations : @xmath46 we can see that the equations are the same as those for spacelike @xmath24 if we exchange @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath24 is null , we can choose @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath49 the einstein equations reduce to @xmath50 @xmath51 follows from the above .",
    "we now consider the case where the spacetime is self - similar as well as cylindrically symmetric : there is no _ a priori _ reason to suppose that this will lead to trivial solutions only .",
    "in other words , we assume that the spacetime admits a vector field @xmath52 which satisfies the following equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the lie derivative along @xmath52 .",
    "we refer to the vector field @xmath52 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : homothetic_killing_eq ] ) as the homothetic vector and the homothetic equation , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath52 has the following form : @xmath55 where @xmath52 is then assumed to be orthogonal to the cylinders of symmetry",
    ". we will refer to this as a cylindrical homothetic vector .",
    "we will mention the limitation of this assumption later .",
    "then , the homothetic equations  ( [ eq : homothetic_killing_eq ] ) yield @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we can then generically make the coordinate transformation @xmath58 and @xmath59 satisfying the following relations : @xmath60 then , we can have @xmath61 where here and hereafter we omit bars for simplicity .",
    "the homothetic vector is timelike , spacelike and null if @xmath62 is positive , negative and zero , respectively .",
    "if @xmath63 or @xmath64 , the homothetic vector is null and we do not consider these special cases here .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the homothetic equations  ( [ eq : homothetic_killing_eq ] ) lead to @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are arbitrary functions .",
    "thus , we obtain the following standard form of the metric for whole - cylindrically symmetric self - similar spacetimes : @xmath69    we can substitute the above form into the einstein equations ( [ eq : einstein_uu ] )  ( [ eq : einstein_zz ] ) and obtain a set of ordinary differential equations for @xmath70 , @xmath68 and @xmath71 . fortunately , for the vacuum case , we can greatly simplify the system .",
    "we consider self - similar vacuum solutions in this section .",
    "it is not trivial that the choice of @xmath33 and @xmath34 adopted in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic]b is compatible with the self - similarity introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic]c .",
    "in fact , for @xmath12 to be compatible with the self - similarity , i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : metricfns_ss_uv ] ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_g ] ) for the vacuum solution must satisfy @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are arbitrary constants .",
    "( we note that a trivial addition of a constant may be required to obtain the above form . ) hence , the choices of @xmath33 and @xmath34 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : r_v - u ] ) and ( [ eq : r_v+u ] ) are both compatible with self - similarity .    for the moment",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath12 has a spacelike gradient .",
    "now we can adopt @xmath75 coordinates and by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : metric_t_x_x ] ) , ( [ eq : metricfns_ss_uv ] ) and ( [ eq : metric_ss_uv ] ) , we find the metric in the following form : @xmath76 where @xmath77",
    "( we recall that @xmath78 . ) in this case , the einstein equations reduce to a set of simple ordinary differential equations . noting @xmath79 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wave_spacelike ] ) , ( [ eq : gammax_spacelike ] ) and ( [ eq : gammat_spacelike ] ) reduce to the following ordinary differential equations : @xmath80 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath81 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath82 therefore , @xmath83 and @xmath84 this satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfsimilar_wave ] ) .",
    "we can integrate the above equation and obtain @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a constant of integration .",
    "@xmath87 is obtained by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) and integrating the resultant equation .",
    "the result is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a constant of integration .",
    "getting back to the original metric functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the solution is given by @xmath92 we can assume @xmath93 because the flip of the sign of @xmath47 corresponds to the other branch of solutions .",
    "note that we can set @xmath94 by absorbing it into the coordinates as follows : @xmath95 up to this gauge parameter , the solutions are parametrized by @xmath89 .    for the timelike @xmath24 case , we can obtain the solution just by exchanging @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the solution for the spacelike @xmath24 case .",
    "this corresponds to the replacement of @xmath81 with @xmath96 .",
    "the solution is therefore given by @xmath97 where the solution is valid for @xmath98 .",
    "we can assume @xmath99 in this case .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , our aim in deriving the solutions of the previous subsection is to study the simplest case of self - similar cylindrical collapse .",
    "however it transpires that these solutions do not represent collapsing gravitational waves .",
    "the solutions are flat everywhere except along the axis , and thus the solutions correspond either to part of minkowski spacetime , or to a line conical singularity in flat spacetime : the assumption of self - similarity of the gravitational waves rules out any other possibility .",
    "this is a nontrivial result regarding self - similar cylindrical collapse .",
    "furthermore , the form of the flat spacetime metric that emerges demonstrates explicitly that there are cylindrical trapping horizons in minkowski spacetime , and that @xmath100energy is ( i ) nonunique and ( ii ) nonzero in minkowski spacetime .",
    "this seriously undermines the interpretation of @xmath100energy as the gravitational energy of a cylindrical spacetime .",
    "we can explicitly show that all coordinate components of the riemann curvature tensor vanish for the obtained solutions .",
    "this means that the solutions are flat .",
    "here we show that these solutions are indeed part of the minkowski spacetimes .",
    "we here assume that @xmath24 is spacelike , i.e. , @xmath101 corresponds to an untrapped cylinder .",
    "the regular axis condition implies @xmath102 as @xmath103 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_spacelike_r ] ) , this is possible only for the upper - sign solution with @xmath104 .",
    "hence , the solution becomes @xmath105 the upper - sign solution for the different choice of @xmath89 gives a conical singularity with the ratio of an infinitesimal circle s circumference to its diameter @xmath106 rather than @xmath19 .",
    "we first concentrate on the upper - sign solution with @xmath107 below .",
    "choosing the coordinates where @xmath94 , we can write the metric as @xmath108 where the solution is valid only for @xmath109 . assuming @xmath93 , through the coordinate transformations @xmath110 or @xmath111 we obtain the following metric for the upper - sign : @xmath112 where @xmath113 by construction . through another coordinate transformation @xmath114",
    "we finally obtain the usual minkowski spacetime in the standard cartesian coordinates @xmath115 where @xmath116 and hence the solution covers the inside of the light cone @xmath117 .",

    "the circle shows the light cone , which is a cylindrical trapping horizon .",
    "the region which is unshaded is not described by the cylindrical vacuum flat solutions .",
    "the dashed lines denote the timelike planes which are identified with @xmath126.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for the lower - sign solution , the metric is written as @xmath127 where @xmath128 . through another coordinate transformation @xmath129",
    "we finally obtain the metric @xmath130 where @xmath116 .",
    "this is also the minkowski spacetime in the standard cartesian coordinates but with nontrivial topology . in the original @xmath121 coordinates ,",
    "@xmath131 is identified with @xmath132 .",
    "this results in the identification between the two timelike hypersurfaces @xmath126 and @xmath133 , where @xmath134 .",
    "the latter timelike hypersurface is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fg : tau_const_section ] .",
    "more precisely , the point @xmath135 is identified with the point @xmath136 . then , there appears a timelike geodesic with infinite spatial acceleration in an approach to the spacelike line @xmath137 , which will be described in detail in the appendix .",
    "the appendix also serves to clarify the nature of the topological identifications made here . on the other hand ,",
    "a circle identification has not been imposed on @xmath119 , implying that the two - dimensional @xmath138 plane consists of covering planes folded infinitely many times .",

    "also for this case , choosing @xmath94 and @xmath142 , we obtain @xmath143 where the solution is valid only for @xmath144 . by implementing coordinate transformations similar to those used in the untrapped case , we obtain for the lower - sign solution @xmath112 where @xmath145 .",

    "this is identical with the lower - sign solution for the untrapped region and hence transformed to the standard cartesian coordinates @xmath124 , where the solution covers the region @xmath146 , i.e. , the intersection of the outside of the light cone and the timelike portion sandwiched by two planes @xmath147 .",
    "we should note that the topology is nontrivial because @xmath4 is circularly identified while @xmath119 is not .",
    "we note that in the trapped case the ( original ) cylinders of symmetry @xmath139 with @xmath140 both constant have the following representation in minkowski coordinates @xmath124 : @xmath149    hence , for @xmath107 , the union of the upper - sign solution for the untrapped region and the lower - sign solution for the trapped region describes the timelike portion of the minkowski spacetime sandwiched by two light planes when the two solutions are matched on the light cone @xmath117 .",
    "the union of the lower - sign solutions for the untrapped region and the upper - sign solution for the trapped region also describes the same region of the minkowski spacetime when they are matched on the light cone @xmath117 but with nontrivial topology .",
    "the solutions with nonvanishing @xmath89 will have an additional conical singularity .",
    "this solution without the conical singularity is quite analogous to the milne universe solution , which is also part of the minkowski spacetime .",
    "however , the present solution is somewhat different from the milne universe in the following respect .",
    "recall that observers with constant spatial coordinates run radially outward with a constant speed and they do so homogeneously and isotropically in the minkowski spacetime . on the other hand , in the present solution ,",
    "observers with constant spatial coordinates run with a constant speed but only in the direction parallel to the axis and do not in the two perpendicular ones .",
    "we shall call the present solution the cylindrical milne solution in this paper .",

    "it has several interesting and useful features : it is covariant and is associated with a conserved flux vector ; it has the correct newtonian limit , the mass per specific length of the cylinder  @xcite ; it is propagated by einstein - rosen waves .",
    "thus it is a candidate for `` _ _ the energy of whole - cylinder - symmetric spacetimes _ _ '' ( the phrase appears in quotation marks in  @xcite , p.251 ) and a later study refers to @xmath100energy as `` gravitational energy per specific length ''  @xcite . as a particular application",
    ", @xmath100 energy has been used to investigate the fate of an infinitesimally thin cylindrical shell composed of counter - rotating dust particles by apostolatos and thorne  @xcite , and later by one of the present author ( kn ) and his collaborators  @xcite : it should be stressed that the conclusions in these two papers do not agree with each other although both rely on the properties of the @xmath100energy .",
    "a further criterion that should be satisfied by a candidate for gravitational energy of any form is that it should vanish in the absence of a gravitational field , i.e.  in flat spacetime .",
    "it transpires however that the cylindrical representations of flat spacetime we have found above show that the @xmath100energy _ does not _ always vanish in this case .    for the einstein - rosen waves written in the forms of eqs .",

    "this result questions the physical interpretation of the @xmath0 energy . indeed",
    ", the trick is in the choice of the two commuting killing vectors , or equivalently , the choice of the cylinders .",
    "if we take @xmath155 , then @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are calculated as @xmath156 where @xmath109 or @xmath116 .",
    "hence , the regular axis condition is satisfied and we obtain nontrivial @xmath0 energy . instead ,",
    "if we take @xmath157 , then we have @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 and obtain vanishing @xmath0 energy .",
    "we should also note that the @xmath119-axis in the former is transformed to @xmath122-axis in the latter .",
    "this means that the definition of @xmath0 energy is ambiguous for the same axis in the same cylindrically symmetric spacetime unless a pair of two commuting killing vectors are fully specified .",
    "thorne  @xcite has noted the lack of uniqueness in the definition of @xmath0 energy in the case of unpolarized cylindrical spacetimes , for which the killing vectors @xmath161 are not orthogonal .",
    "nonuniqueness in the unpolarized case is related to the loss of invariance of the spacetime under reflections through any plane either containing the axis or perpendicular to it .",
    "however as we see in the present case , nonuniqueness can remain even in the polarized case when there is more than one choice of the azimuthal and translational killing fields .",
    "this clearly gives rise to a question about the interpretation of @xmath0 energy as `` _ gravitational energy per specific length _ ''",
    "@xcite , given that it may be nonzero in the absence of a gravitational field .",
    "but as we have pointed out , @xmath0 energy has many attractive and useful features , and so perhaps the most natural question to ask at this point is if there exists an alternative definition that would have the additional feature of vanishing for _ any _ cylindrical slicing of minkowski spacetime .",
    "we hope to address this question in future work .    although the uniqueness of the @xmath0 energy may be recovered by _ specifying _ the pair of killing vectors , it is still true that the null hypersurface @xmath125 in the original coordinates or the light cone @xmath117 in the standard cartesian coordinates gives a cylindrical trapping horizon .",

    "a trapping horizon is defined as a hypersurface foliated by marginally trapped cylinders and hence will not be closed in general . since they are not closed , it will not imply the existence of spacetime singularity .",
    "thus , this example is a lesson that we can not reasonably identify a trapping horizon with a black hole horizon for cylindrically symmetric spacetimes  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we could have closed trapped surfaces if we change the identification . in that case",
    ", we may encounter a sort of singularity as described in the appendix .",
    "in the previous two sections , we showed that the only self - similar cylindrically symmetric vacuum spacetimes comprise flat spacetimes , possibly with line conical singularities along the axis .",
    "these are trivial examples of self - similar spacetimes , and so while these may act as ( intermediate ) asymptotic endstates of certain more general cylindrical configurations - and indeed a line conical singularity in an otherwise flat spacetime can result from the complete collapse of cylindrical null dust - it is clear that this does not lend any weight to the self - similarity hypothesis in cylindrical symmetry .",
    "it transpires however that part of the reason for this is that we have looked only at a quite restrictive class of self - similar cylindrical spacetimes .",

    "we have also discussed that there exists a cylindrical trapping horizon in the minkowski spacetime and that the notion of trapping horizons might not be useful for defining black holes in cylindrically symmetric spacetimes  at least , not in the case where the marginal two - surfaces foliating the horizon are cylinders .",
    "next , we have extended the analysis to the more general class of einstein - rosen waves , still respecting some kind of scaling behavior . assuming a regular or conically singular axis , we have obtained a two - parameter family of non flat self - similar solutions , where the homothetic vector is not orthogonal to the cylinders in general .",

    "there is also a discrete subset of solutions which exhibit the collapse of gravitational waves developed from nonsingular initial data on a spacelike cauchy surface .",
    "we conclude that self - similar einstein - rosen waves can describe nontrivial dynamics of gravitational waves if and only if the homothetic vector is not orthogonal to the cylinders of symmetry . although the original proposal for the self - similarity hypothesis in general relativity is restricted in spherical symmetry , it is also likely that some of these self - similar solutions can describe the asymptotic behavior of more general solutions even in cylindrical symmetry .",
    "in fact , recent numerical simulations  @xcite strongly suggest that the asymptotic behavior of a dispersing gravitational wave within the null hypersurface @xmath325 after the collapse of a dust cylinder is well approximated by a member of the family of solutions obtained here with @xmath326 and @xmath327 ( see figs .",

    "the present paper clarifies that this asymptotic solution belongs to the family of self - similar einstein - rosen waves with a non cylindrical homothetic vector and a conical singularity and that this asymptotic solution corresponds to gravitational waves inside the exploding shell of gravitational waves as shown in fig .",

    "<S> the self - similarity hypothesis claims that in classical general relativity , spherically symmetric solutions may naturally evolve to a self - similar form in certain circumstances . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , the validity of the corresponding hypothesis in nonspherical geometry is very interesting as there may exist gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate self - similar vacuum solutions to the einstein equation in the so - called whole - cylinder symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we find that those solutions are reduced to part of the minkowski spacetime with a regular or conically singular axis and with trivial or nontrivial topology if the homothetic vector is orthogonal to the cylinders of symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are analogous to the milne universe , but only in the direction parallel to the axis . using these solutions </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the nonuniqueness ( and nonvanishing nature ) of @xmath0 energy and the existence of a cylindrical trapping horizon in minkowski spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> then , as we generalize the analysis , we find a two - parameter family of self - similar vacuum solutions , where the homothetic vector is not orthogonal to the cylinders in general . </S>",
    "<S> the family includes the minkowski , the kasner and the cylindrical milne solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained solutions describe the interior to the exploding ( imploding ) shell of gravitational waves or the collapse ( explosion ) of gravitational waves involving singularities from nonsingular initial data in general . </S>",
    "<S> since recent numerical simulations strongly suggest that one of these solutions may describe the asymptotic behavior of gravitational waves from the collapse of a dust cylinder , this means that the self - similarity hypothesis is naturally generalized to cylindrical symmetry . </S>"
