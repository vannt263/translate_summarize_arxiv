    "the solar 22-year activity cycle is thought to be a manifestation of dynamo action somewhere inside the solar convective zone or even in the overshoot layer .",
    "the solar differential rotation acts as a driver of the solar dynamo , generating a toroidal magnetic field from an existing poloidal magnetic field . the other dynamo driver , required to transform toroidal magnetic field into poloidal and so to close the chain of self - excitation , is thought to be what is commonly known as the @xmath0-effect , i.e. a specific feature of convective flows in a rotating body .",
    "it was e.  parker who suggested as early as 1955 that cyclonic motions in the solar convective zone produce a mean ( large - scale ) poloidal magnetic field from a mean toroidal magnetic field .",
    "ten years later , steenbeck , krause & rdler developed a theory of this process , calling it the @xmath0-effect ( see krause & rdler 1980 ) .",
    "a physical feature of the @xmath0-effect in the form discussed at this stage is that the action of the coriolis force on the convective vortices results in a domination of right - handed vortices in the northern solar hemisphere and , correspondingly , left - handed vortices in the southern . a non - vanishing difference between vortices with right and left helicities in a given hemisphere",
    "provides the required conversion of toroidal magnetic field to poloidal .",
    "parker ( 1955 ) demonstrated that the scheme briefly discussed above leads to the self - excitation of a wave of magnetic field ( the so - called dynamo wave ) .",
    "a suitable choice of the differential rotation shear and mean helicity of solar convection in , say , the northern hemisphere leads to a dynamo wave whose shape mimics remarkably that of the solar butterfly diagram .",
    "the simplest order of magnitude estimates for the dynamo governing parameters results in an estimate for the cycle length which is about 10 times shorter then the real solar cycle  this seems reasonable for this obviously oversimplified model .    until now the above scheme for the solar dynamo , known as the parker migratory dynamo , has remained the basis of most dynamo models for solar and stellar dynamo activity",
    "of course , present day solar dynamo models include achievements of helioseismology , effects of meridional circulations and various other features of solar mhd . as a result ,",
    "these dynamo models are much richer and , in principle at least , closer to the real sun then the simple parker model . nevertheless ,",
    "although these more sophisticated models can reproduce many specific details , some points remain as obscure now as in 1955 ( for recent reviews , see ossendrijver 2003 ; brandenburg & subramanian 2004 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath0-effect remained for several decades a theoretical concept only .",
    "it is deeply associated with the helicity of rotating turbulence and arises from averaging maxwell s equations over the ensemble of rotating vortices . for a long time",
    ", there was no evidence available to support the @xmath0-effect from either astronomical observations or from laboratory mhd experiments .",
    "obviously , such a situation makes the basis of solar dynamo theory rather unsatisfactory and even shaky .    in the last decade",
    ", some basic progress here has been made and the first observational data of physical quantities associated with the @xmath0-effect are now available .",
    "the fundamental point is that the @xmath0-effect includes two contributions ( pouquet et al .",
    "1976 ) , an hydrodynamical contribution as discussed above ( @xmath1 ) associated with helicity of convective vortices , and also a contribution from the helicity of the magnetic field itself ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic helicity is determined by a correlation between the convective velocity @xmath3 and its vorticity , i.e. @xmath4 , and so its observational determination requires knowledge of all three components of velocity while the doppler effect gives a line - of - sight velocity component only .",
    "the magnetic part of the @xmath0-effect , @xmath2 , can be related to what has become known as the current helicity , proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the small - scale magnetic field . because zeeman splitting provides information concerning all 3 components of @xmath6 , @xmath7 appears to be more accessible for observational determination than @xmath1 ( seehafer 1990 ) . as a result , the first observations to be made relate to the current helicity in active regions on the solar surface ( pevtsov et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ; zhang & bao 1998 , 1999 ; longcope et al . 1998 ) .",
    "such observational findings about the current helicity on the solar surface can be related to theoretical results in dynamo theory , where the concept of the magnetic part of @xmath0-effect has been developed into a theory of dynamo saturation through @xmath2 .",
    "kleeorin & ruzmaikin ( 1982 ) and kleeorin & rogachevskii ( 1999 ) suggested a governing equation for @xmath2 which describes the time evolution of the @xmath0-effect . together with the mean - field dynamo equations , this equation has solutions in the form of a propagating dynamo wave which amplitude is steady in time ( kleeorin et al .",
    "1995 ; covas et al . 1998",
    "; blackman & brandenburg 2002 ) .",
    "kleeorin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discussed a link between the observational and theoretical findings outlined above .",
    "they concluded that the accumulated observational knowledge is sufficient to follow the temporal evolution during one solar cycle of current helicity averaged over a given hemisphere or the latitudinal distribution of current helicity averaged over one solar cycle .",
    "existing ideas concerning the nonlinear solar dynamo saturated by the magnetic part of the @xmath0-effect provide a theoretical prediction of the corresponding quantities .",
    "these demonstrate a general agreement with observations and provide a possibility of fitting the governing parameters of the solar dynamo by observational data .    here",
    "we present an extension of the approach of the paper of kleeorin et al .",
    "first of all , we discuss the extent to which the solar helicity data can be used to understand the radial dependence of solar magnetic helicity and the corresponding dynamo activity .",
    "an initial step in this direction was made by kuzanyan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who separated the database of active regions for which the helicity data are available into subsets corresponding to shallow , middle and deep active regions , according to their rotation rate .",
    "of course , a substantial part of the data can not be so classified . after averaging magnetic helicity data over the subsets",
    ", we obtain quantities which can be compared with the theoretical data averaged over the three radial ranges .",
    "this approach is to some extent similar to the studies of the solar rotation curve using the sunspot data associated with various types of sunspots . following the remarkable advances in helioseismology",
    "such reconstructions now look rather archaic ( this is why we refer here only to the single paper , collin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , in which one of the authors participated ) .",
    "however , at this preliminary stage of solar helicity studies , a similar approach appears to be reasonable .",
    "the other topic to be addressed here is a plausible improvement of the governing equation for the magnetic helicity .",
    "the point is that the dynamo saturation by a magnetic contribution to the @xmath0-effect is necessarily combined with a modification of the turbulent diffusivity and other transport coefficients . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", these effects were ignored in our first paper ( kleeorin et al .",
    "now we restore these terms in order to investigate their possible contribution , and to produce a more fully self - consistent model .    obviously , our model is still simplified and does not include many important features of solar activity . in particular we do not address the problem of the storage of magnetic fields and the formation of flux tubes in the overshoot layer near the bottom of the convective zone ( see , e.g. , spiegel & weiss 1980 ; tobias et al .",
    "2001 ; tobias & hughes 2004 ; brandenburg 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "our research is based on the data on current helicity accumulated during 10 successive years ( 1988 - 97 ) of observations at the huairou solar observatory station of the national astronomical observatories of china ( bao and zhang 1998 ) , which were further processed by zhang et al .",
    "the description of the observational procedure and the basic ideas of data processing can be found in kleeorin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and references therein",
    ". the total available sampling that we used contains data of 410 active regions .    following kuzanyan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we divide the active region into 4 groups , i.e. shallow , middle and deep active regions , as well as a group for which the depth can not be estimated satisfactorily ( table  1 ) .",
    "the separation of the active regions into three groups is based on the result of helioseismology ( schou et al .",
    "1998 ) that the angular rotation rate growth monotonically with radius at least for the domain between fractional radii 0.65 and 0.95 and latitudes below 30 - 35@xmath8 ( for details see kuzanyan et al . 2003 ) .    the solar geophysical data records , which can be obtained from the noaa ( usaf - mwl ) database ,",
    "provide us with several tens of longitudinal locations ( in terms of the carrington coordinate system ) for each active region under investigation , for several consequent days .",
    "therefore , we attempt to calculate partial , or `` individual '' , angular rotation rates with respect to the carrington rotation . for some active regions",
    "we can find a certain trend in the evolution of their carrington coordinates with time . from the complete sampling of the data , which contain 410 active regions , we select subsamples for which this trend in carrington longitude _ versus _ time has significant correlation .",
    "we determined the subsamples for which the correlation coefficient @xmath9 is greater than 0.5 and 0.6 respectively .",
    "these samples contain 178 and 134 active regions ( or @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the available data ) , respectively .",
    "given an `` individual '' angular rotation rate for each active region we can identify them with certain _ effective _ depths . using a particular analytical approximation of the solar rotation curve (",
    "see kuzanyan et al .",
    "2003 ) , the active regions with known individual angular rotation were separated into three groups .",
    "the individual rotation rates in the first group fall into the range covered by the analytical approximation for the radial range @xmath12 , for the second group the bound is @xmath13 , and @xmath14 for the third group .",
    "these groups were labelled as deep , middle and shallow .",
    "notice , that the internal rotation of the solar convective zone above approximately fractional radius 0.94 is slower than in the zone below , and so we disregarded this sub - surface layer .",
    "we stress that the above bounds were chosen rather arbitrarily and the details of trends in the current helicity properties with respect to depth can hardly be considered quantitatively .",
    "the active regions appear to be distributed between the upper and lower layers approximately equally , while very few occur within the middle layer ( kuzanyan et al .",
    "we will consider separately the upper and lower layers and compare the results of statistical analysis of the data in each of them .",
    "because the current helicity is expected to be of opposite sign in northern and southern hemispheres , we subdivide these groups between the two hemispheres and average the data in each group over all latitudes as well as cycle phases .",
    "the result of averaging @xmath15 is given in table  1 for active regions with identified depth . here",
    "@xmath16 is a depth identifier , with `` s '' meaning shallow , `` m '' middle and `` d '' deep active regions . because the number of active areas of intermediate depth appears to be quite low , and insufficient to estimate the sign of helicity",
    ", we combine quite arbitrarily the data for the middle and deep active regions into a single group , i.e. `` d+m '' .",
    "@xmath17 is the number of active regions included in each group . for table  1",

    "we present below a model for the nonlinear dynamo saturation .",
    "the model is based as far as possible on first principles , and is similar to that used in the derivation of the equations of mean - field electrodynamics by krause & rdler ( 1980 ) . as an important technical point",
    ", we used a quasi - lagrangian approach in the framework of wiener path integrals to derive the dynamical equation for the evolution of the magnetic helicity including magnetic helicity flux ( see kleeorin & rogachevskii 1999 ) .",
    "we also used the spectral @xmath114-approximation ( orszag s third - order closure procedure ) to determine the nonlinear mean electromotive force ( see rogachevskii & kleeorin 2000 , 2004 ) . here",
    "we note some important features of the model only .",
    "a key assumption of the model under discussion is the concept of the locally isotropic and weakly inhomogeneous nature of the background mhd turbulence ( with a zero mean magnetic field ) . because we include large - scale phenomena such as helicity advection , the accuracy of the approximation is limited . in particular , a completely rigorous evaluation of the turbulent diffusion of magnetic helicity is beyond the scope of our model and we allow this quantity to be transported by the turbulent diffusion in the same way as a scalar admixture , i.e. the turbulent diffusion coefficient is determined by the velocity field correlation tensor .",
    "in contrast , the nonlinear coefficients of the large - scale magnetic field defining the nonlinear mean electromotive force are determined by the cross - helicity of magnetic ( @xmath115 ) and velocity ( @xmath116 ) fields , i.e. by @xmath117 .",

    "the current helicity distribution is more complicated at the base of convective zone compared to that near the solar surface .",
    "this is in general agreement with the observational information concerning the radial distribution of solar helicity ( sect .  2 ) .    the normalized local nonlinear dynamo number @xmath220 $ ] is shown in fig .  8 at every point of the computational grid , as a function of mean magnetic field .",
    "here @xmath221 is normalized by the local value of @xmath222 .",

    "this shows the very important role of the magnetic part @xmath2 of the @xmath0-effect , which causes the saturation of the growth of the mean magnetic field .",
    "we need to reduce the numerical data from our modelling to a form comparable with the observations available .",

    "we isolate a region @xmath223 , i.e. a @xmath224belt centered on the equator , because helicity data are available for this equatorial domain only .",

    "we obtain the following values of the helicity integrals . for the ` deep ' region ( @xmath225 ) , we obtain @xmath234 and @xmath235 , while for the ` shallow ' region @xmath236 we obtained @xmath237 and @xmath238 . the clear difference in helicity distribution between deep and shallow regions remains robust when the density parameter @xmath239 is reduced to @xmath240 [ see eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) ] .",
    "for the deep region ( @xmath225 ) , we then obtain @xmath241 ( of course , the equality is a pure coincidence ) while for @xmath199 we obtained @xmath242 and @xmath238 .",
    "we conclude that the available observational data concerning the radial distribution of current helicity seems to be consistent with the corresponding differences in numerical model .",
    "we consider the observed radial dependence of the current helicity as an observational manifestation of a structure similar to that presented in the numerical models .",
    "note that the choice of the latitudinal and radial belts in which the helicity integrals are calculated does affect significantly the numbers above . for our basic run ,",
    "calculating the helicity integrals for the whole northern hemisphere we obtain @xmath243 and @xmath244 for @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 for @xmath248 and @xmath249 , @xmath250 for @xmath236 .",
    "obviously , these values of helicity integrals calculated for these more arbitrarily chosen belts are less impressive than the previous , where the belts were isolated on the basis of snapshots of the helicity distribution .",
    "the important thing is that a link between helicity integrals and depth is still visible here .",
    "we stress that the available observational data , as well as the nature of the dynamo model , do not allow any quantitative description of the radial helicity distribution .",
    "the best that we can hope to do is to isolate some link between these quantities .",
    "the important result is that such a link appears to exist , without reference to a particular choice of boundaries .",
    "we stress this fact and do not take exactly the same boundaries in for shallow , middle and deep regions throughout the whole paper .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated that the available observational data concerning solar current helicity give some hints concerning its radial distribution .",
    "the active regions clearly associated with the upper layers of solar convective zone demonstrate a significantly more homogeneous distribution of the current helicity than the deeper regions .",
    "we interpret this as an observational indication that the structure of the solar activity wave deep inside the sun is substantially more complicated than near its surface .",
    "in contrast to a rather smooth structure of the surface activity wave with the dominant pattern propagating from the middle latitudes to the equator , we expect a more complicated structure of activity waves deep inside the sun .",
    "in particular , the waves with `` wrong '' polarity deep inside the sun are expected to be more important compared to the main wave than nearer the surface .",
    "we have demonstrated that the scenario of solar dynamo based on magnetic helicity conservation arguments can be extended to include radial dependence .",
    "this scenario leads to a steady oscillatory solution in a substantial domain of the parametric space , of a form that is at least consistent with our basic understanding of internal solar structure .",
    "if we choose a more extreme parameter set , it is natural that we will need to include more effects ( say , buoyancy ) into the dynamo saturation mechanisms .",
    "slightly unexpectedly , we note that the results of dynamo simulations are remarkably close to the available magnetic helicity observations .",
    "the structure of dynamo waves deep inside the convective zone is much sharper and more complicated than the smooth surface structure .",
    "the waves of `` wrong '' polarity of helicity are pronounced in deeper layers and almost undetectable at the surface .",
    "we hope that this is an indication that our theoretical understanding of the solar dynamo has some observational support from helicity data .",
    "of course , we stress that the very preliminary nature both of the topic and of our model prevents any strong conclusion , and that more observational and theoretical efforts are required to support our inferences .",
    "however , in any case the result obtained is perhaps as good as could be expected at the moment .",
    "we emphasize that the ability of the observations to support ( or reject ) theoretical ideas concerning the radial properties of the solar activity wave is highly nontrivial .",
    "in contrast , we can neither support nor reject a scenario suggested by choudhuri et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who believe that the number of active regions violating the polarity law should be significantly larger at the beginning of the cycle rather in the later phases .",
    "some tendency of this kind is visible in tables 5 and 6 , but the data are insufficient to support any firm statement .",
    "further studies of a larger sample of active regions ( cf .",
    "bao et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) may help to address this point .",
    "note that the helicity distribution presented in fig .",
    "5 could be represented as a propagation of the activity wave from one hemisphere to the other .",
    "suppose that a wave of negative helicity penetrates from northern hemisphere into the southern , where positive helicity dominates .",
    "such a penetration of an activity wave into a `` wrong '' hemisphere was investigated for parker migratory dynamo by galitski et al .",
    "they estimated the scale of penetration as about a dozen degrees in latitude , which seems broadly consistent with fig .",
    "5 .    in our basic numerical model",
    ", the helicity close to the surface does not exhibit any migration .",
    "this perhaps seems quite unexpected , but does not directly contradict any observational or theoretical knowledge . note that the butterfly diagrams for the mean surface poloidal magnetic field exhibit standing , rather than propagating , waves ( obridko & shelting 2003 ) .",
