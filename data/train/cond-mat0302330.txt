    "the resent development of ultrafast nonlinear optical experiments has stimulated immense interest in spintronics in semiconductors as it shows great potential of using the spin degree of freedom of electrons in place of / in addition to the charge degree of freedom for device application such as qubits , quantum memory devices , and spin transistors .    in order to make use of the spin degree of freedom in semiconductor spintronics ,",
    "it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of spin dephasing mechanism .",
    "three spin dephasing mechanisms have been proposed in semiconductors:@xcite the ellit - yafet ( ey ) mechanism,@xcite the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism,@xcite and the bir - aronov - pikus ( bap ) mechanism.@xcite in the ey mechanism , the spin - orbit interaction leads to mixing of wave functions of opposite spins .",
    "this mixing results in a nonzero electron spin flip due to impurity and phonon scattering .",
    "the dp mechanism is due to the spin - orbit interaction in crystals without inversion center , which results in spin state splitting of the conduction band at @xmath2 .",
    "this is equivalent to an effective magnetic field acting on the spin , with its magnitude and orientation depending on @xmath3 .",
    "finally , the bap mechanism is originated from the mixing of heavy hole and light hole bands induces by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "spin - flip ( sf ) scattering of electrons by holes due to the coulomb interaction is therefore permitted , which gives rise to spin dephasing .",
    "the dephasing rates of these mechanisms for low polarized system are calculated in the framework of single particle approximation.@xcite for gaas , the ey mechanism is less effective under most conditions , due to the large band gap and low scattering rate for high quality samples .",
    "the bap mechanism is important for either @xmath4-doped or insulating gaas . for @xmath0-doped samples , however , as holes are rapidly recombined with electrons due to the presence of a large number of electrons , spin dephasing due to the regular bap mechanism is blocked .",
    "therefore , the dp mechanism ( or possibly the ey mechanism under certain conditions ) is the main mechanism of spin dephasing for @xmath0-type gaas .",
    "it is important to note that all the mechanisms above either provide or are treated as sf scattering .",
    "spin - conserving ( sc ) scattering , such as the ordinary coulomb scattering , electron - phonon and electron - nonmagnetic impurity scattering which has been extensively studied in connection with optical dephasing and relaxation,@xcite are commonly believed to be unable to cause spin dephasing as the corresponding interaction hamiltonians commute with the total spin operator .",
    "recently wu proposed a many - body kinetic theory@xcite to study the spin precession and spin dephasing in insulating znse / zn@xmath5cd@xmath6se quantum well ( qw),@xcite @xmath0-typed bulk gaas samples,@xcite and @xmath0-typed gaas ( 110 ) qw,@xcite under moderate magnetic fields in the voigt configuration .",
    "based on this many - body theory , he further showed that the sc scattering can also cause spin dephasing in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "this novel spin dephasing mechanism has long been overlooked in the literature .",
    "differing from the earlier study of the spin dephasing which comes from sf scattering , the spin dephasing through inhomogeneous broadening is caused by irreversibly disrupting the phases between spin dipoles and is therefore a many - body effect.@xcite very recently we have shown that this inhomogeneous broadening effect also plays an important role in the spin transport@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we study the spin dephasing in @xmath0-doped gaas ( 100 ) qw s .",
    "we calculate the sdt by numerically solving the many - body kinetic equations with all the scattering included .",
    "differing from the previous investigation in the bulk case where we are only able to get the sdt qualitatively,@xcite here we get the sdt quantitatively thanks to the reduction of dimension in the momentum space .",
    "moreover as we include the electron - electron coulomb scattering in our calculation , for the first time we are able to study the spin dephasing with extra large initial spin polarization ( up to 100  % ) which has not been investigate both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : we present our model and the kinetic equations in sec .",

    "the temperature dependence of the sdt under different spin polarization is discussed in detail in sec .",
    "iii(c ) , where we also highlight the difference between the present many - body theory and the earlier simplified theory . in sec .",
    "iii(d ) we show the magnetic field dependence of the sdt .",

    "we present the conclusion and summary in sec .  iv .",

    "the growth direction is assumed to be @xmath8-axis . a moderate magnetic field * b * is applied along the @xmath9 axis .",

    "consequently , the spin signal that with the coulomb scattering differs from the one without the coulomb scattering .",
    "it has been pointed out that the spin dephasing due to the dp term and the sc scattering comes from two effects.@xcite the first one is widely discussed that is due to the anisotropic property of the dp term , which , combined with sc scattering gives rise to the effective sf scattering.@xcite in this case , inclusion of additional scattering enhances the momentum relaxation rate and consequently reduces the spin dephasing rate.@xcite it has been pointed out that the electron - electron coulomb scattering , although does not contribute to the momentum relaxation rate , trends to reduce the spin dephasing@xcite based on the similar analysis as in refs .   and .",
    "the second is that the dp term itself also introduces an inhomogeneous broadening , which in the presence of the sc scattering provides _ additional _ spin dephasing channel@xcite and therefore results in a faster spin dephasing .",
    "our calculation self - consistently solves the kinetic bloch equations and includes _ both _ effects .",
    "the result indicates that for the present condition the second effect is more important and therefore the combined effect by inclusion of the coulomb scattering leads to the increase of the spin dephasing .",
    "we now turn to study the spin polarization dependence of the sdt . as",
    "our theory is a many - body theory and we include all the scattering , especially the coulomb scattering , in our calculation , we are able to calculate the sdt with large spin polarization .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the sdt @xmath86 is plotted against the initial spin polarization @xmath87 for gaas qw s with @xmath79 [ fig .  [ fig3](a ) ] and @xmath88 [ fig .  [ fig3](b ) ] at different temperatures . the most striking feature of the impurity - free case is the huge increase of the sdt in low temperatures . for @xmath89",
    "k , the sdt increases from 25  ps at low polarization to 720  ps at @xmath90  % polarization .",
    "in other words , the spin dephasing rate is decreased more than one order of magnitude when the spin polarization increases from 0 to 100  % .",
    "it is also seen from the figure that the increase of the sdt is reduced with the increase of temperature . for @xmath91",
    "k , the sdt only gets an 80  % increase when the polarization increases from 0 to 100  % .",
    "the dramatic increase in the @xmath86-@xmath87 curve in the low temperature regime originates from the electron - electron interaction , specifically the hartree - fock ( hf ) self - energy [ _ i.e. _ , the last terms in the eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_coh ] ) and ( [ eq : rho_coh ] ) ] . as we know",
    "that the hf term itself does not contribute to the spin dephasing directly.@xcite however , it behaves as an effective magnetic field which can alert the motion of the electron spins and can therefore affect the spin dephasing by combining with the dp term . for small spin polarization as commonly discussed in the literature ,",
    "the contribution of the hf term is marginal .",
    "however , when the polarization gets higher , the hf contribution becomes larger .",
    "for example , the magnitude of the effective magnetic field of hf term is larger than 40  t , which is about ten folds of the applied magnetic field , for the case when the temperature is 120  k and the spin polarization is @xmath90  % . differing from the applied magnetic field which in the voigt configuration only gets the transverse components ( _ i.e. _ @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) and always causes the electrons to flip between spin - up and -down bands , the effective magnetic field formed by the hf term contains a longitudinal component [ @xmath94 which can effectively reduce the `` detuning '' of the spin - up and -down electrons , and thus strongly reduces the spin dephasing . in order to show this detuning effect",
    ", we remove the longitudinal component of the effective magnetic field @xmath95 and recalculate the sdt at the temperature of @xmath96  k for different initial spin polarization for an impurity free sample .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . from the figure",
    "one can see that when the longitudinal component of the hf term is removed , the dramatic increase in the @xmath86-@xmath87 curve disappears and the sdt is insensitive to the initial spin polarization .",
    "when the temperature increases , for a given initial spin polarization the hf term becomes smaller as the electrons are distributed to a wider range in the @xmath3-space .",
    "therefore the effect of the hf term becomes smaller too .",
    "consequently the increase in the @xmath86-@xmath87 curve becomes slower .",
    "the @xmath86-@xmath87 curve gets flatter when the impurities are introduced .",
    "it is shown from fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) that , when the density of impurity is large , say @xmath88 , the fast rise in the @xmath86-@xmath87 curve in low temperature regime still remains .",
    "nevertheless the rate of increase is much smaller than the corresponding one when the impurities are absent .    to further reveal the contribution of the impurity to the dephasing under different conditions , we plot the sdt as a function of the polarization for different impurity levels at @xmath89  k in fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the figure clearly shows that when the impurity concentration increases , the slope of the @xmath86-@xmath87 curve becomes smaller .",
    "this is because that impurity scattering reduces the hf term and the effect of the longitudinal component of the hf term is also reduced .",
    "consequently , the increase of sdt with the polarization is reduced .",
    "it is interesting to note that contrary to the high polarization regime where the sdt decreases with the impurity concentration , the spin dephasing is reduced by the impurity scattering in the low polarization regime . as we pointed out before that the impurities affect the spin dephasing in two ways.@xcite on the one hand ,",
    "the electron - impurity scattering provides a new spin dephasing channel by combining with the dp term@xcite to give an effective sf scattering through the inhomogeneous broadening introduced by the dp term .",
    "this gives rise to the enhancement of the dephasing . on the other hand ,",
    "the scattering also redistributes the electrons in the momentum space and leads them to an isotropic distribution .",
    "therefore , the scattering can suppress the anisotropy caused by the dp term , consequently the effective sf scattering .",
    "moreover , the suppression of the anisotropy also corresponds to the reduction of the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "both lead to a smaller spin dephasing .",
    "our results indicate that in the low temperature and the low polarization regime , the impurities tend to reduce the spin dephasing .      above we discussed the dependence of spin dephasing on initial spin polarization for different temperatures .",
    "now we turn to the temperature dependence of the sdt under different initial spin polarizations . from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( b ) in sec .",
    "iii(b ) , one can see that for small spin polarization , the sdt increases with the temperature . whereas in high polarized regime , the sdt decreases with the temperature . for moderate polarization ,",
    "the temperature dependence is too complicated to be described by a monotonic function of temperature . under certain condition",
    ", the sdt can be insensitive to the temperature , e.g. the sdt is almost unchanged with the temperature when the polarization @xmath97  % and @xmath88 .    to see more detail of how the spin dephasing depends on the temperature , we replot in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and ( b ) the sdt shown in figs .",

    "it is seen from the figure that , for low polarization , the sdt increases systematically with the temperature for all impurity levels .",

    "moreover , it has been reported very recently that there is a big discrepancy between the earlier simplified treatment of the dp effect and the experiment on the sdt .",
    "it is shown that the theoretical sdt is about one order of magnitude larger than the experiment data in @xmath0-type bulk gaas for certain electron densities.@xcite    it is seen that our many - body result is better than the earlier simplified treatments both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the reason that our model is more precise than the earlier one lies on the fact that the earlier model is based on the single particle picture which does not count for the dephasing due to the inhomogeneous broadening inherited in the dp term , which is the result of the many body effect . by comparing the theoretical sdt predicated by the two models",
    ", we can see that the spin dephasing due to the inhomogeneous broadening is much more important . in the case we calculated , the spin dephasing is dominated by the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "therefore , it is easy to understand why the earlier simplified treatment of the dp mechanism gives much slower spin dephasing .",
    "the temperature dependence of the sdt can be understood once the spin dephasing due to the inhomogeneous broadening is taken into account : when the temperature increases , the inhomogeneous broadening is reduced as the electrons are distributed to the wider @xmath102-states . as a result , the number of electron occupation on each @xmath3 state is reduced .",
    "it is further noted that this reduction is mild as a function of the temperature .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence is quit mild unless it is within the regime where the hf term plays an important role in the spin dephasing .    in the region where the hf term is important , in addition to the",
    "above mentioned two effects of the temperature on the spin dephasing , the temperature dependence of the hf term should also be taken into account .",
    "in general , the temperature dependence of the sdt due to the combination of these three effects is too complicated to be described by a monotonic function .",
    "we replot the sdt as a function of the temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , for a typical high polarization @xmath97  % .",
    "we can see that due to the reduction of the hf term , the reduce of the detuning is removed and sdt drops dramatically with the increase of the temperature in the impurities free sample . while for the system with impurity concentration @xmath88 , the hf term is not as important as in the impurities free sample , and the sdt is insensitive to the temperature .",
    "we now investigate the magnetic field dependence of the spin dephasing . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we plot the sdt versus the applied magnetic field for different impurity levels and different spin polarizations .",
    "it is seen from the figure that in small polarization regime for both impurity free and doped samples , the sdt is almost a constant when the magnetic field varies from 1  t to 8  t. whereas , in the high polarization regime , the sdt increases with the magnetic field when the magnetic field varies from 1  t to 4  t and then saturates when the magnetic field is larger than 4  t. it is noted that the transverse magnetic field imposes two effects on the spin dephasing .",
    "one is that in the presence of a magnetic field , the electron spins undergo a larmor precession around the magnetic field .",
    "this precession suppresses the precession about the effective magnetic field @xmath41 of the dp term.@xcite therefore the sdt increases with the magnetic field .",
    "however , in the presence of the transverse magnetic field , the spin precession frequency between the spin - up and -down band is @xmath103 .",
    "hence the transverse magnetic field may introduce an additional inhomogeneous broadening for the electrons and consequently results in a shorter sdt . in the cases we study ,",
    "the sdt is almost unchanged with the magnetic field with the combined contributions from these two effects .    in additional to the above",
    "mentioned effects of the magnetic field on the spin dephasing , one can further see from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , that for large spin polarization , the magnetic field enhances the sdt . as we mentioned before , for large spin polarization , the contribution from the hf term is important",
    ". therefore , the magnetic field can further affect the spin dephasing rate through the enhancement of the hf term in the high initial spin polarization regime .",
    "it is shown in the figure that , for high initial spin polarization , when the magnetic field increases , the enhanced hf term results in a fast decrease of spin dephasing rate .",
    "nevertheless , after the magnetic field is high enough , the hf term arrives it maximum . as a result ,",
    "the sdt saturates with the magnetic field .",
    "we now turn to the electron density dependence of the spin dephasing . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we plot the sdt as a function of the electron density for both low and high spin polarizations .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that for low polarization , the sdt decreases with electron density : from @xmath104  ps for @xmath105  @xmath75 to @xmath76  ps for @xmath106  @xmath75 .",
    "this is because with the increase of the electron density , more electrons are distributed at large momentum states and strengthen the dp effect as the dp term increases with the momentum . for the high spin polarization",
    ", the sdt also decreases with the electron density , however , with a much faster speed .",
    "when the initial spin polarization is 75% , the sdt decreases from 280  ps for @xmath107  @xmath75 to 8  ps for @xmath108  @xmath75 .",
    "this is understood that when the electron density increases , the effect of hf term becomes less important comparing to the increase of the dp term .",
    "it is noted from the experiments that the sdt of quantum wells is much smaller than that of bulk material .",
    "this is because the dp term in the quasi - two dimensional quantum well contains a term which is proportional to the @xmath109 . for a regular quantum well in the order of 10  nm ,",
    "this term is much larger than the square of fermi vector @xmath110 , when the electron density is up to the order of @xmath111  @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the dp term in the quantum well is greatly enhanced .",
    "moreover , the smaller the width is , the larger the dp term becomes and the faster the sdt turns to be . in this subsection",
    "we study the effect of the quantum well width on the spin dephasing . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] the sdt is plotted as a function of the initial spin polarization for three different widths .",
    "moreover , in figs .",
    "[ fig11](a ) and ( b ) we plot the sdt as a function of the temperature for two initial spin polarizations in three different quantum wells .",
    "these figures clearly show that , for all situations , the spin dephasing rate decreases with the increase of the well width .",
    "especially when the width is decreased by only 50  % from 20  nm , the sdt is reduced by one order of magnitude .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed a systematic investigation of the dp effect on the spin dephasing of @xmath0-typed gaas qw s for high temperatures under moderate magnetic fields in voigt configuration .",
    "based on the nonequilibrium green s function theory , we derived a set of kinetic bloch equations for a two - spin - band model .",
    "this model includes the electron - phonon , electron - impurity scattering as well as the electron - electron interaction . by numerically solving the kinetic bloch equations",
    ", we study the time evolution of electron densities in each spin band and the spin coherence  the correlation between spin - up and -down bands . the spin dephasing time is calculated from the slope of the envelope of the time evolution of the incoherently summed spin coherence .",
    "we therefore are able to study in detail how this dephasing time is affected by spin polarization , temperature , impurity level , magnetic field and electron density .",
    "different from the earlier studies on spin dephasing based on the single particle model which only considers the effective sf scattering , our theory also takes account of the contribution of many - body effect on the spin dephasing .",
    "in fact , for the @xmath0-typed semiconductors and the spin polarization studied in the experiments , this many - body dephasing effect is even more important than the effective sf scattering as it can be one order of magnitude larger than the later .",
    "equally remarkable is that , as we include all the scattering , especially the coulomb scattering in our many - body theory , now we are able to calculate the spin dephasing with extra large ( up to 100  % ) initial spin polarization .",
    "it is discovered that the sdt increases dramatically with the initial spin polarization .",
    "we stress here that the sdt is defined to be the inverse of the spin dephasing rate , instead of the total life time which naturally increases with the initial spin polarization . at low impurity level and for low temperature , the magnitude of sdt increases more than one order when the initial polarization goes from 0 to 100  % .",
    "it is discovered that this dramatic increase originates from the hf contribution of the electron - electron coulomb interaction .",
    "the hf term forms an effective magnetic field which affects the spin dephasing .",
    "as the longitudinal component of the hf term effectively reduces the `` detuning '' between the spin - up and -down bands , the spin dephasing becomes much slower in high polarization region . due to the fact that the dramatic increase comes from the hf term , the magnitude of the increasement is therefore affected by all the factors that influences the hf term , such as temperature , impurity scattering , magnetic field as well as the electron density .",
    "when the temperature or the impurity density increases , the effective magnetic field formed by the hf term for a given initial spin polarization decreases .",
    "therefore , the increase in @xmath86-@xmath87 curve is reduced , and the @xmath86-@xmath87 curve becomes flatter .",
    "nevertheless when the magnetic field increases , the hf term is enhanced and the increasement in the @xmath86-@xmath87 is enhanced accordingly . when the magnetic field increases beyond 4  t , the hf saturates .",
    "consequently after 4  t , the increase in @xmath86-@xmath87 curves only gets slight changes with the magnetic field .    for low spin polarized regime ,",
    "the sdt increases with the temperature .",
    "this is contrary to the result of earlier simplified single - particle calculation where the sdt always decreases with the increase of the temperature .",
    "moreover , the sdt predicted by our many - body calculation is one order of magnitude faster than the earlier result .",
    "we show that our results are in agreement with the experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the physics of this feature is due to the additional many - body spin dephasing channel due to the inhomogeneous broadening provided by the dp term , which by combining with the sc scattering also causes spin dephasing . in the situation we studied ,",
    "the spin dephasing is dominated by the many - body dephasing effect . with the increase of the temperature ,",
    "the inhomogeneous broadening reduces and the sdt increases .",
    "the effect of the electron - impurity scattering on the spin dephasing is also studied .",
    "the sdt increases in the presence of the impurity scattering .",
    "this is because the impurity scattering redistributes the electrons to an isotropic state which in turn reduces the spin dephasing .    in high spin polarization region , in additional to the above mentioned role the scattering plays in the spin dephasing , the scattering also affects the hf term .",
    "this brings more complication in the study of the spin dephasing . in general",
    "the sdt can not be described by a monotonic function of the temperature or the impurity concentration in high polarization region . for a typically high initial spin polarization ,",
    "@xmath97  % , the sdt decreases dramatically with the temperature as the reduction of the detuning is suppressed when the temperature increases .",
    "whereas when the impurity concentration is @xmath112 , the sdt is insensitive to the temperature .",
    "as the magnetic field causes the electron spins to precess about it , this precession will suppress the precession about the effective magnetic field @xmath41 originated from the dp effect .",
    "however , the transverse magnetic field in the voigt configuration also introduces additional inhomogeneous broadening in the momentum space and enhances the spin dephasing . as a result of the combining effects , for the condition we studied , the spin dephasing is almost unchanged with the magnetic field in low spin polarization region .",
    "the magnetic field also enhances the hf term , therefore the @xmath86-@xmath73 curve gets a faster increase in the high polarization region when the magnetic field is smaller than 4  t. in the region of the magnetic field higher than 4  t , the hf term achieves its maximum . the effect of the magnetic field on the hf term saturates , the sdt saturates accordingly .",
    "our calculation also shows that when then electron density increases , the sdt decreases . this is because with the increase of the electron density ,",
    "more electrons are distributed at larger momentum states and consequently the dp term is strengthened . while as the width of the quantum well increases , the sdt decreases as the dp term reduces .    in summary",
    "we have performed a thorough investigation of the spin dephasing in @xmath0-typed gaas qw s for high temperatures .",
    "many new features which have not been investigated both theoretically and experimentally are predicted in a wide range of parameters ."
