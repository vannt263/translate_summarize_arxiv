    "the spin - seebeck effect ( sse ) enables the generation of a non - equilibrium spin current by a temperature gradient@xcite .",
    "when a conductor is attached to a magnetic material , the sse induces a spin - current injection into the conductor .",
    "the sse is of crucial importance in spintronics @xcite and spin caloritronics @xcite , since it enables simple and versatile generation of spin currents from heat .",
    "the spin current induced by the sse is converted into electric voltage via the inverse spin - hall effect ( ishe ) owing to the spin orbit interaction in the conductor@xcite .",
    "the combination of sse and ishe provides a new way of thermoelectric conversion .",
    "although this phenomenon has been observed in many magnetic materials @xcite , the thermoelectric conversion efficiency of the sse device is still small and its improvement is essential for realizing future spin - current - driven thermoelectric generators@xcite .",
    "the thermoelectric voltage in a sse device is affected by several factors , such as the spin hall angle of the conductor , the quality and magnetic propeties of the magnetic material , and the conductor / magnet interface condition .",
    "the conductor / magnet interface condition in sse devices should govern the injection efficiency of a thermal spin current across the interface , which is described in terms of the spin - mixing conductance@xcite . in our previous work",
    ", we found that the spin - mixing conductance of a pt / yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) spin - pumping system is sensitive to the atomic - scale interface condition , and a well - controlled and highly - crystalline interface is a prerequisite for a large spin - mixing conductance@xcite .",
    "however , few works have involved the influence of the interface condition on the sse@xcite , and it is yet to be investigated systematically .    in this work ,",
    "we systematically study the influence of the interface condition on the sse in pt / yig systems , which have been widely used for investigating the sse @xcite .",
    "we controlled the pt / yig interface condition in atomic scale , and measured the ishe voltage induced by the sse with changing the interface conditions .",
    "these measurements enable to form a perceptual understanding of the influence of the interface condition on the sse and of the spin - injection mechanism at the conductor / magnet interface .",
    "in this study , we employ a longitudinal configuration to investigate the sse in the pt / yig system@xcite .",
    "the longitudinal sse ( lsse ) device consists of a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic insulator covered with a paramagnetic conductor film ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "when a temperature gradient @xmath0 is applied to the ferromagnetic layer perpendicular to the paramagnet / ferromagnet interface , a spin current is injected into the paramagnetic layer via the sse .",
    "then an ishe - induced electric field @xmath1 is generated in the paramagnetic layer according to the relation @xmath2 where @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denote the spatial direction of the thermally generated spin current and the spin - polarization vector of electrons in the paramagnetic layer , respectively .",
    "the preparation process of our pt / yig samples is as follows .",
    "the yig films were grown on ( 111 ) gadolinium gallium garnet ( ggg ) substrates by using a liquid phase epitaxy ( lpe ) method in @xmath5-@xmath6 flux at the temperature of 1210 k. the thickness of the yig films is about 4.5 @xmath7 m .",
    "the surfaces of the yig films were annealed under oxygen pressure of @xmath8 torr at 1073 k for 2 hours to improve the crystal structure , or were bombarded by ion beams to create amorphous layers@xcite . after the annealing or ion beam bombardment process",
    ", 10 nm - thick pt films were deposited on those yig films with the same condition by using a pulse laser deposition system at room temperature in the same vacuum chamber .",
    "the crystalline characterization of the pt / yig samples was carried out by means of an x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) method and a high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "the lattice constant was calculated from the xrd and electron diffraction patterns .",
    "the magnetization ( @xmath9)-magnetic field ( @xmath10 ) curve of the yig film was measured by using a vibrating sample magnetometer .",
    "the lsse measurements were performed by using an experimental system similar to that described in ref .",
    "the pt / yig sample with the size of @xmath11 mm@xmath12 was sandwiched between two aln heat baths , of which the temperatures were stabilized to 300 k+@xmath13 and 300 k , respectively .",
    "the temperature gradient was generated by a peltier thermoelectric module .",
    "the electric voltage difference @xmath14 between the ends of the pt layer was measured by using a micro - probing system , where a distance between the two probes is about 5 mm .     and",
    "@xmath10 denote the temperature gradient and the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "[ figure1],width=288 ]",
    "first of all , we evaluate the quality of the yig films grown by the lpe method .",
    "figure [ figure2](a ) shows the tem image of the yig / ggg interface ; the image confirms that the yig film is epitaxially grown on the ggg substrate , and no defect is observed owing to the small lattice - constant mismatch between yig and ggg@xcite .",
    "the xrd patterns of the yig film in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) show a good single crystal characteristic , where only the ( 444 ) peak is observed .",
    "the lattice constants of the yig film and ggg substrate determined by the xrd results are 12.376 @xmath15 and 12.384 @xmath16 , respectively , both of which are in good agreement with the values found in previous literature@xcite .",
    "the yig films have almost the same crystal quality as the ggg substrate because of the same full width at half maximum of the rocking curves ( fig . [ figure2](c ) ) .",
    "the @xmath9-@xmath10 curve of the yig film in fig . [ figure2](d ) shows that the coercive force of the yig film is very small ( smaller than 5 oe ) and the saturation magnetization is 4@xmath17=1710 g ( close to the bulk value @xcite ) .",
    "these sample characterizations clearly confirm that our yig films are of very high quality .",
    "( c ) the comparison of the rocking curves between the yig film and the ggg substrate .",
    "( d ) the @xmath9-@xmath10 curve for the yig film . [ figure2],width=576 ]    figure [ figure3](a ) shows the cross - sectional structure of the prepared pt / yig interface measured by a high - resolution tem .",
    "the crystal perfection of the yig surface was found to be well kept even after forming the pt film ; the yig layer has a perfect single - crystalline structure with a [ 111 ] direction perpendicular to the pt / yig interface .",
    "the pt layer has a typical polycrystalline structure without a preferred orientation .",
    "the pt / yig interface used in this study has the same high quality as that shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . by using such pt / yig devices",
    ", we measured the lsse voltage @xmath18 .    in fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) , we show @xmath18 in the pt / yig sample with the highly - crystalline interface as a function of the temperature difference @xmath13 at the magnetic field @xmath10=100 oe , measured when the magnetic field was applied along the @xmath19 direction . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) , the sign of @xmath18 for finite values of @xmath13 in the pt / yig device is reversed by reversing the @xmath0 direction .",
    "this result indicates that the observed voltage signals are attributed to the lsse , on the basis that the direction of the thermally generated spin current at the pt / yig interface is reversed by reversing @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ figure3](c ) shows the voltage signal @xmath14 as a function of @xmath10 for various values of @xmath13 .",
    "the sign of @xmath14 is reversed by reversing @xmath10 at finite values of @xmath13 , consistent with the feature of the ishe - induced electric field ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "the shape of the @xmath14-@xmath10 curves is in good agreement with that of the @xmath9-@xmath10 curve for the yig film ( compare figs .",
    "[ figure2](b ) and [ figure3](c ) ) , confirming that the observed voltage @xmath14 is associated with the magnetization reversal of the yig layer .",
    "now we investigate the influence of the pt / yig interface condition on the lsse voltage . to compare the magnitude of the lsse voltage , we normalize @xmath18 with the temperature difference @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath20 for the pt / yig sample with the highly - crystalline interface is about 3.6 @xmath21 .",
    "this value is 45% larger than that for the sample without the annealing process ( fig .",
    "[ figure4](d ) ) , in which an amorphous layer with the thickness of @xmath221 nm was observed at the pt / yig interface ( fig . [ figure4](a ) ) .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath20 is attributed to the improvement of the spin mixing conductance , which determines the transfer efficiency of spin currents across the pt / yig interface .",
    "@xcite     dependence of @xmath18 for the pt / yig lsse device , shown in ( a ) , measured when a temperature gradient @xmath0 is applied along the @xmath23 ( left ) and @xmath24 ( right ) directions .",
    "( c ) @xmath10 dependence of @xmath14 for the pt / yig lsse device , shown in ( a ) , for various values of @xmath13 .",
    "[ figure3],width=576 ]    to further investigate the relation between the interface condition and the lsse voltage , we measure the dependence of @xmath18 on the thickness of the amorphous interlayer in the pt / yig samples .",
    "we found that the thickness of the amorphous layer at the pt / yig interface can be changed by ion - beam bombardment ; the thickness of the amorphous layer increases with increasing the acceleration voltage ( @xmath25 ) of the ion beam ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "although it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the properties of the amorphous layers , we believe that its macroscopic magnetization is extremely depressed because of the broken crystal structure , while localized spins may be alive because of the presence of iron atoms .    the @xmath10 dependence of @xmath20 for various amorphous - layer thicknesses are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure4](d ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath20 in the pt / yig samples decreases exponentially with increasing the thickness @xmath26 of the amorphous layer , indicating that the amorphous layer blocks the spin injection from yig to pt . by fitting the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath20 with an exponential function @xmath27 @xmath28 with @xmath29 being an adjustable parameter ,",
    "the decay length @xmath30 is estimated to be @xmath312.3 nm .",
    "the estimated @xmath30 value for the amorphous layer is greater than those for other non - magnetic insulator oxide barriers estimated from the spin - pumping measurements using pt / oxide / yig systems@xcite , implying that the remaining localized spins in the amorphous layer may reduce a potential barrier for spin currents@xcite .",
