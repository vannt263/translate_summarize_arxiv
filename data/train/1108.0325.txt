    "in this paper , we consider a sphere composed of homogeneous and isotropic elastic material in helical motion around a fixed gravitational centre ( an elastic planet , so to speak , which , like the moon , turns the same side to the gravitational center ) .",
    "gravity is considered as a given background , described either by a newtonian potential or the schwarzschild solution of general relativity .",
    "the elastic sphere is therefore exposed to a combination of tidal and centrifugal forces , both of which cause elastic deformations . due to the helical nature of the motion it is possible to go to the co - rotating coordinate system , in which we face only an elastostatic problem .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows : in the sections 2 - 4 we briefly review the general theory of relativistic elastodynamics , relativistic elastostatics and nonrelativistic elastostatics , viewed under one general framework . to get reasonable boundary conditions , in elastostatics",
    "it turns out it is preferable to use the material picture . in section 5",
    ", we consider the general principles of existence / uniqueness proofs based on the implicit function theorem in elastostatics , as used by beig and schmidt in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . after having considered the linearization of the elastostatic equations in section 5",
    ", we review , in section 6 , the existence proof given in @xcite for the elastic sphere on a circular orbit in a newtonian gravitational field in a version adapted to our purposes . in section 7 , we then give the explicit solution for the linearized elastostatic equations in this situation , making use of an ansatz from papkovich and neuber ( @xcite , @xcite , also see @xcite and the references therein ) . in section 8",
    ", we also consider the linearized elastostatic equations for the relativistic case and give the solution .",
    "a existence / uniqueness proof similar to the nonrelativistic one is presumably possible , but some details still need to be worked out yet .",
    "this will be part of a future publication .",
    "we start from full relativistic elastodynamics , as laid down in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the fields of the theory are mappings @xmath0 from the spacetime @xmath1 , equipped with the spacetime metric @xmath2 ( assumed to have signature @xmath3 ) , to the _ body manifold _",
    "it can be thought of as the abstract collection of points ( `` atoms '' ) the elastic material in question is composed of .",
    "generally , @xmath4 is a open , connected and bounded subset of @xmath5 with smooth boundary @xmath6 , and equipped with a volume form @xmath7 .",
    "its single componend will be denoted @xmath8 .",
    "we will use coordinates @xmath9 on the body manifold @xmath4 and @xmath10 on the spacetime @xmath1 .",
    "the mapping @xmath11 , which is also called _ configuration _ , is required to uniquely define a future - pointing , timelike , normalized ( @xmath12 ) 4-velocity vector @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 i.e. the inverse of a point @xmath15 is a timelike curve in @xmath1 , the trajectory of that point .",
    "we further require @xmath11 to be orientation - preserving , which allows us to define a positive particle number density @xmath16 by @xmath17 using the configuration mappings @xmath11 from @xmath1 to @xmath4 to describe elastic materials is called _ spatial _ or _",
    "eulerian picture_. this is the more natural way to go in relativistic elastodynamics .",
    "it is also possible to use mappings @xmath18 , called _ deformations _ , which are in a certain sense inverse to the @xmath19s .",
    "this is called _ material _ or _ lagrangian picture _ ,",
    "which is more commonly used in non - relativistic elasticity theory , but in full relativistic elasticity theory , the spatial picture is much more natural .",
    "we will later on introduce and use the material picture when dealing with elastostatic situations , though .    from the configuration gradient @xmath20",
    ", we can now define the _ strain tensor _ @xmath21 by definition , it is symmetric and positive definite , so it also has an inverse @xmath22 .",
    "an elastic material is specified by giving an _ stored - energy function _",
    "@xmath23 which describes the elastic potential energy per particle .",
    "we assume @xmath24 to be covariant under spatial diffeomorphisms ( the so - called  principle of material frame indifference  ) , which implies that @xmath24 depends on the configuration gradient @xmath20 and @xmath10 just via the strain tensor ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath25 from differentiating @xmath24 , we can define the _ second piola - kirchhoff stress tensor _ @xmath26 the _ first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor _ @xmath27 and the _ cauchy stress tensor _ @xmath28 the equations of motion for the fields @xmath19 are then given as the euler - lagrange equations of the action @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the relativistic total energy density given by rest energy plus stored energy function : @xmath31",

    ", we suppose that we have an everywhere timelike killing vector field @xmath32 , and that the velocity vector field @xmath13 is proportional to it , so that we have @xmath33 we further suppose that the spacetime @xmath1 can be written as product of space and time @xmath34 where the space manifold @xmath35 is the quotient of @xmath1 by the isometry group generated by @xmath32 .",
    "the metric @xmath36 on @xmath35 is in a suitable coordinate system @xmath37 on @xmath38 given by @xmath39 whereas the inverse metric @xmath40 is just equal to the spatial part of the inverse metric of @xmath1 : @xmath41 this is why we immediately get for the strain tensor @xmath42 the particle number density @xmath16 is now determined via the metric epsilon tensor @xmath43 on @xmath35 belonging to @xmath44 via @xmath45 which is equivalent to @xmath46 to adapt the action to the elastostatic setting , we need to split @xmath47 .",

    "an awkward feature of the spatial picture shows up : the inverse of @xmath19 appears in the description of the boundary .",

    "the _ first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor _ already introduced in equation has a particularly simple form in the material picture : @xmath66 it will also appear in the elastostatic equations and the boundary conditions . to get them",
    ", we have to transform the action principle to the form @xmath67 from the variation of , we get the elastostatic equation in the material picture : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the so - called _ material derivative _ given by @xmath70 the @xmath71 denote the christoffel symbols of the metric @xmath36 , evaluated at @xmath72 .",
    "the elastostatic equations in the material picture are accompanied by the following boundary conditions : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a conormal vector to @xmath6 .",
    "as already noted , the structure of this boundary conditions is much nicer than in the spatial picture ( equation ) , because the boundary is fixed and does not depend on the fields .",
    "the equations governing nonrelativistic elastostatic can be retrieved as limit for @xmath75 , which can be applied directly to the action principle using the decomposition and @xmath76 if one neglects a constant  null lagrangian ",
    "proportional to @xmath77 , which goes to infinity in the nonrelatvistic limit , but does nt contribute to the resulting euler - lagrange equations to get @xmath78 from varying this action , we get the nonrelativistic elastostatic equations @xmath79 again together with the boundary conditions @xmath80 alternatively , those could also have been retrieved by applying the limit @xmath75 directly to , .",
    "for the purpose of finding existence / uniqueness results , we assume that there is a stress - free reference state @xmath81 ( all quantities referring to this reference configuration will be denoted with a bar ) .",
    "we will later use the implicit function theorem for finding solutions near the reference state .",
    "stressfreeness ( i.e. @xmath82 ) is equivalent to ( because of equation ): @xmath83 we can always choose coordinate systems so that the reference deformation map is just the identity map on @xmath4 , i.e. we identify @xmath4 with the subset of space @xmath35 occupied by the elastic body in the reference state : @xmath84 in such a coordinate system , @xmath85 can be considered as metric on @xmath4 .",
    "we further assume that the material has a constant density @xmath86 in the reference state , which is equivalent to the volume form on @xmath4 being the metric one and its component @xmath87 .",
    "we can write equation in the form @xmath88 + \\mathscr{f}_i[\\phi^j ] = 0\\ ] ] where the _ elasticity operator _ @xmath89 $ ] is defined by @xmath90 = \\nabla_a \\sigma_i{}^a\\ ] ] it is quasi - linear , as can be easily calculated from formula : @xmath91 where the _ elasticity tensor _",

    "we thus introduce operators @xmath101 , which assign tuples @xmath102 to deformation maps @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a volume force definded on @xmath4 and @xmath105 is a surface force defined on @xmath6 .    in order for the operators @xmath106 and @xmath107 to be well - defined and @xmath108 , we assume the spaces @xmath109 and @xmath110 to be the sobolev spaces standard in elasticity theory ( see @xcite , @xcite ) : for @xmath109 we use a neighbourhood of the reference configuration @xmath81 in @xmath111 with @xmath112 , which we assume to be small enough so that every @xmath103 has an @xmath108-inverse . for @xmath110 , which is also called _ load space _ , we use @xmath113 thus , we now have to solve the equation @xmath114 + t f[\\phi^j ] = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are given by @xmath115(x^b ) = ( ( \\nabla_a \\sigma_i{}^a)(x^b ) , ( \\sigma_i{}^a n_a)(x^b)|_{\\partial \\mathcal{b}})\\ ] ] and @xmath116(x^b ) = ( ( k_i \\circ \\phi ) ( x^b ) , 0)\\ ] ] the second component is just 0 , because we always use the boundary condition of vanishing surface traction ( equation ) .",
    "it is well known that such an composition operator is @xmath108 if the vector field @xmath117 is ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the variable @xmath54 will become our linearization parameter .",
    "an important property of the operator @xmath106 is that it does not have full range : if a load @xmath118 , it has to satisfy the _ equilibrium conditions _ for the six euclidean killing vectors @xmath119 @xmath120 this is most conveniently seen in the spatial picture by using the symmetry of @xmath121 , the killing equation for @xmath119 and stokes theorem .",
    "the intuitive meaning of this is that the total force and total torque on @xmath4 have to vanish , otherwise the body would be set into motion , and no static solutions would exist .    finally let us review some well - known facts about the linearization @xmath122 at @xmath123 ( see @xcite ) : it is a fredholm operator with a kernel given by elements of the form @xmath124 where @xmath119 runs through the six euclidean killing vectors . also the image of @xmath122",
    "has co - dimension six , and is given by the subspace of @xmath110 that satisfies the equilibrium conditions for @xmath125 .",
    "we now want to invoke the implicit function theorem to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions of .",
    "this is possible , because we have already seen that both operators @xmath106 and @xmath107 are @xmath108 in the appropriate sense .",
    "we are thus considering one - parametric families @xmath126 of solutions ( @xmath54 being the parameter ) with @xmath127 .",
    "as a first step , we note that we obviously have @xmath128 = 0 $ ] because of the stressfreeness of the reference configuration .",
    "but unfortunately , since the linearization of the operator @xmath106 at @xmath81 has a non - trivial kernel and range , we can not apply the implicit function theorem directly .",
    "we circumvent this difficulty by a two - step procedure :    the first step is to restrict @xmath109 and @xmath110 to @xmath129 and @xmath130 so that the linearization of @xmath106 becomes an isomorphism . to deal with the non - trivial range of @xmath106",
    ", we define @xmath131 and choose a fixed 6-dimensional complement @xmath132 of it , i.e. @xmath133 this defines a unique projection operator @xmath134 from @xmath110 to @xmath130 along @xmath132 : @xmath135 we now apply @xmath134 to equation @xmath136 + \\mathbb{p } \\circ f[\\phi^j ] = 0\\ ] ] the linearization of @xmath137 $ ] is just @xmath138 $ ] , which is onto @xmath130 by definition .    to solve the problem of the non - trivial kernel , we consider solutions of the form @xmath139 where @xmath140 is an arbitrary element from the kernel of @xmath106 and @xmath141 is from a complement of the kernel of @xmath106 that contains @xmath81 , which we will denote @xmath129 .    with this restriction",

    "in other words , one needs to check that the full equations rather than just the projected ones are valid by a suitable choice of @xmath140 .",
    "this can then be done using the finite - dimensional implicit function theorem . for details",
    ", we refer to the concrete example below .",
    "the perturbation of @xmath61 is defined as @xmath144 from perturbing we get the expression @xmath145 the perturbation for the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor can be calculated from : @xmath146 here , it was used that the reference configuration is stress - free by assumption ; otherwise , additional terms would appear in , which would make our treatment much more complicated .    using this , the definition of @xmath147 ( equation ) and our assumption on the coordinate system ( @xmath148",

    "the only killing vector that satisfies the conditions is the translational one @xmath171 ( pointing from the body to the gravitational centre ) .",

    "also , the equilibrium conditions are all automatically satisfied except for @xmath173 , i.e. also the co - range of @xmath172 only has dimension @xmath174 .",

    " here means that the homogeneous solution contains enough yet unspecified constants so it may be matched to any boundary conditions .",
    "then the particular solution and the homogeneous solution are added and the constants specified by imposing the zero - traction boundary condition .",
    "the potential has the disadvantage of being not rotationally symmetric , but it can be decomposed in two parts with that property by a simple coordinate transformation : a shift of the coordinate origin to the center of the body at @xmath194 ( i.e. by @xmath195 ) .",
    "the centrifugal term in the potential then becomes @xmath196 the term @xmath197 is just the centrifugal potential caused by a rotation of the body along an axis through its center ; this problem has already been solved ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in the end , this solutions can be just added because of the linearity of the linearized elastic equation . the constant term proportional to @xmath198",
    "can be neglected because it does nt contribute to the force density .",
    "the remaining term @xmath199 is the part of the potential that is going to be used further on .",

    "we now want to consider an elastic sphere on a circular orbit in the schwarzschild metric @xmath310 we first recapitulate that these orbits ( for point particles ) can be found using the following neat property : we assume @xmath32 to be a timelike killing vector field , i.e. it satisfies the killing equation @xmath311 then a orbit @xmath312 of the flow of @xmath32 with the normalized tangent vector ( 4-velocity ) @xmath313 is geodesic , i.e. satisfies @xmath314 if and only if the gradient of @xmath315 vanishes everywhere on @xmath312 : @xmath316 this can be easily seen by inserting into to get @xmath317 and noting that the second term vanishes identically because of the killing equation .",
    "we now apply this to the helical killing vector ( remember that constant linear combinations of killing vectors are killing vectors themselves ) @xmath318 of the schwarzschild metric . for its normal value , we get @xmath319 from forming the gradient of , we get the equations @xmath320 equation has the solutions @xmath321 , @xmath322 and @xmath323 , but equation can only be solved for @xmath322 .",
    "we thus got the circular geodesics in the equatorial plane with @xmath324 , where @xmath160 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 have to satisfy the same relation as in the newtonian case : @xmath162 in order for @xmath325 to be timelike , i.e. equation to be negative , it is necessary that @xmath326 .",
    "we now consider an elastic sphere moving on such an orbit .",
    "we do so by changin to the co - rotating coordinate system .",
    "we do this by introducing co - rotating coordinates : @xmath327 using this coordinate transformation ( and renaming @xmath328 back to @xmath329 afterwards ) , becomes @xmath330 we introduce the potential term @xmath331 the metric @xmath44 on @xmath35 , the quotient of the schwarzschild spacetime @xmath155 along the helical killing vector @xmath32 given by , is then given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath39 with , we get @xmath332 the elastostatic equations are",
    "@xmath333 with @xmath334 the christoffel symbols of the metric become @xmath335 the not mentioned ones are zero . for the last two christoffel symbols we have used the taylor expansion @xmath336 we notice that the christoffel symbols consist of two parts : the regular christoffel symbols of flat space in spherical coordinates ( which we will denote @xmath337 from now ) , plus some correction terms proportional to @xmath338 , which we will denote @xmath339 .    like in @xcite , we treat the relativistic equation by splitting it in the nonrelativistic problem plus some correction terms .",
    "thus we write @xmath340 inserting this decomposition and in and multiplying with @xmath341 yields @xmath342 the linearized equation can then be obtained by differentiating with respect to @xmath343 and setting it zero afterwards . for simplicity , we perturb around an relaxed configuration ,",
    "i.e. we assume @xmath344 as usual , we will identify @xmath4 with the part of physical space n occupied by the body in the reference configuration , i.e. @xmath345 the superscript ?",
    "? will be used from now on to denote quantities referring to the reference configuration only .",
    "we also assume the stored energy function @xmath24 to be zero in the reference configuration @xmath346 this is necessary , because @xmath24 explicitely occurs in the relativistic elastostatic equations ( as opposed to the nonrelativistic ones ) , and thus they are not invariant under adding a constant to @xmath24 .",
    "the perturbation of @xmath347 is then just equal to the standard expression well - known from nonrelativistic elasticity theory : @xmath348 where the @xmath349 are given by the lame constants : @xmath350 the force term just becomes the nonrelativistic one in the perturbation process ( remember that @xmath351 and @xmath352 in the reference configuration ) : @xmath353 for the christoffel symbol term in , we get @xmath354 the christoffel symbols @xmath355 together with the partial derivatives form the regular affine connection on flat space .",
    "when we denote this @xmath356 , we get for the perturbed elastostatic equation @xmath357 the first term is the nonrelativistic elasticity operator , which becomes with and @xmath358 the perturbations @xmath359 are proportional to the displacement vector @xmath360 : @xmath361 the perturbations of the correction term of the stress tensor is given by @xmath362 all other terms vanish because of the assumption of stressfreeness of the reference configuration , and @xmath363 is defined by @xmath364 the inverse of the three - metric inserted into gives @xmath365 and the same components for @xmath366 because of @xmath367 . with this and , equation becomes @xmath368 with the divergence @xmath369 for further use , it is convenient to write @xmath370 in cartesian coordinates , which we are free to do , since the linearized problem is defined on euclidean space",
    ". then becomes @xmath371 with the rotational killing vector @xmath372 where @xmath158 is the unit vector orthogonal to the rotation plane .",
    "we now proceed as in the nonrelativistic case by shifting the coordinate origin to the center of the body at @xmath194 ( @xmath159 is the unit vector pointing from the body to the gravitational centre , i.e. @xmath373 in the cartesian coordinate system used above ) by @xmath374 thus , @xmath375 is the normal vector to @xmath376 , so the boundary conditions to the linearized elastostatic equation to be solved become @xmath377 this system is best to handle if one treats the parts of @xmath378 independently by @xmath379 also , @xmath380 is decomposed in a similar way by inserting @xmath381 and @xmath382 in equation .",
    "thus , the elastostatic equation with the boundary condition decomposes into :    \\1 .",
    "the non - relativistic equation with the homogeneous boundary conditions : @xmath383 this has already been solved    \\2 . a relativistic correction term for @xmath384 , coming from the gravitational part of the curved metric : @xmath385 and    \\3 . a relativistic correction term for @xmath386 of the same form as , , coming from the rotational part of the metric .",
    "we consider the relativistic corrections due to the term @xmath387 its trace is given by @xmath388 so we get @xmath389 the divergence of @xmath390 leads to the correction term of the force @xmath391 which can be expressed as the negative gradient of the potential @xmath392 with the coefficients @xmath393 with these , one gets a particular solution that is of the same form as in the nonrelativistic case : @xmath394    let us us now consider the boundary conditions .",
    "the unit normal vector to @xmath4 is @xmath395 . inserting this into @xmath396 yields : @xmath397 in order to plug this in our ansatz , we need to develop this in suitable ( associated ) legendre functions of the form @xmath398 the most convenient way to accomplish this is to start by the generating function @xmath399 and differentiate it with respect to @xmath400 , which yields @xmath401 the components of @xmath402 in spherical coordinates then become ( again , we rename @xmath400 to @xmath206 from now on to save some writing effort ) @xmath403 to get @xmath404 in the desired form , we use the identity ( see @xcite ) @xmath405 which holds for all @xmath406 , to get @xmath407 after two index - shifts , it becomes into the form with the coefficients @xmath408 in an analogue way , for @xmath409 , we use the identity ( also for all @xmath406 and taken from @xcite as well ) @xmath410 to get ( after two index - shifts as well ) it into the form with @xmath411    we now have everything ready to plug into the ansatz from papkowitsch and neuber , similar to the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the particular solution is given by the same formula as in the nonrelativistic case , but with the coefficients .",
    "also the homogeneous solution is the same as in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the free constants @xmath248 ,",
    "@xmath254 and @xmath255 have to be determined from the boundary conditions @xmath412 from the boundary condition for @xmath413 and the discrete symmetries imposed , we conclude that @xmath414 , as in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the required stress tensor components for the particular solution are @xmath415 with this and , , , , the other two boundary conditions become @xmath416 @xmath417 for @xmath203 , we actually have just one equation , because the @xmath418 component of both the particular and the homogeneous solution vanish identically , and @xmath226 does not occur in the overall solution .",
    "we thus get @xmath419 which leads to @xmath420 this means that we get a contraction of the elastic sphere due to relativistic effects .    to get a solution of the system , for @xmath421 , we view the determinant of the system .",
    "like in the non - relativistic case , it is @xmath422 @xmath423 , so there is no unique solution for @xmath202 , but we see that equation becomes @xmath424 times equation .",
    "thus there are solutions , which are given by @xmath425 while @xmath274 is arbitrary . after adding the @xmath202 term of the particular solution to the homogeneous solution",
    ", we thus get @xmath426 the term proportional to @xmath274 is the translational killing vector @xmath427 , which has to be determined from the equilibrium conditions after the rest of the solution , just as in the nonrelativistic case .    for @xmath428 , we have @xmath429 , so we can solve the system , directly to get @xmath430 after adding the particular solution and the homogeneous solution using the constants and , we thus get as overall solution @xmath431 with @xmath432      we consider the relativistic corrections due to the term @xmath433 its trace is given by @xmath434 for the sake of completeness , we collect the terms , and to get @xmath435 to calculate the force correction term in the elastostatic equation , we calculate @xmath436 and the divergence of @xmath437 is given by @xmath438 thus the correction term in becomes @xmath439 after the coordinate origin shift , we get @xmath440 this can be even further decomposed into @xmath441 the @xmath442 part leads to ( in a cartesian coordinate system with @xmath158 as the @xmath213-axis ) the system @xmath443 this describes spheres in rigid rotations along an axis through their center ; a solution is given in @xcite .",
    "it remains to find a solution to @xmath444 . by looking at it the right way , it becomes immediately clear that it can be considered as the strain tensor belonging to the followin perturbation : @xmath445 i.e. @xmath446 as can be easily seen by elementary vector calculus ( remember that the flat metric @xmath447 is used instead of the curved one @xmath40 , because after linearization , the whole problem is considered to be defined on euclidean space ) .",
    "thus , the displacement belonging to minus the one given in equation has a strain tensor that cancels out @xmath444 , and thus automatically satisfies both the elastostatic equation and the boundary conditions belonging to @xmath448 .",
    "so the displacement vector is basically identical to ( going from @xmath449 to @xmath359 causes another minus sign ) apart from the factor @xmath343 : @xmath450 in a cartesian coordinate system with the axes @xmath451 , this means : @xmath452 note that this term breaks the rotational symmetry .    .",
    "the material and orbit parameters are the same as for the nonrelativistic picture [ nichtrelativistische_graphik ] on page : the material used is steel ( @xmath95 = 108 gpa , @xmath96 = 78 gpa , @xmath86 = 7860 kg/@xmath307 ) . for the orbit velocity @xmath308 = 9.3 km / s was used , and @xmath309 .",
    "the gravitational centre is in the direction of the top side of the picture . in order to see the relativistic effects",
    "well , the speed of light was set to @xmath53=20.8 km / s . ]    .",
    "otherwise , the picture is similar to figure [ relativistische_graphik_1 ] . ]",
