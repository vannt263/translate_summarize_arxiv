    "capillary condensation is a classical example of a well - studied phenomenon in nature  @xcite .",
    "it is usually observed in a porous medium with hydrophilic surfaces , where water condenses out above its bulk transition temperature .",
    "the opposite effect , that is capillary evaporation , is observed when the surfaces are hydrophobic .",
    "first explained by lord kelvin for the case of vapor - water coexisting phases , capillary condensation was also observed in other two phase gas - liquid systems and studied in various confining geometries  @xcite .",
    "in fact , capillary condensation exists in any confined system close to the transition point ( binodal ) provided that the surfaces prefer one of the phases over the other and the bulk transition is of the first order .",
    "in this situation the condensed phase is stabilized by the presence of the surfaces in the region of the phase diagram where the condensed _ bulk _ state is metastable .",
    "interest in capillary condensation phenomenon has recently been renewed due to the fast development of high - precision force measuring devices , such as atomic force microscope ( afm ) and surface force apparatus ( sfa ) . indeed , accurate measurements of the interactions between surfaces separated by thin fluid films led to a discovery of unexpectedly strong and long - range attraction in some systems . in many cases ,",
    "direct or indirect measurements proved that these attractive interactions are due to the formation of a capillary bridge .",
    "below we mention some examples where , in our opinion , bridging could play an important role :    \\(i ) _ attraction between hydrophobic surfaces : _ early sfa measurements revealed the presence of an attractive interaction between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solutions  @xcite .",
    "these conclusions were confirmed by later afm experiments  @xcite .",
    "this attraction is much larger than could be expected for a van der waals force . as a typical example ,",
    "the observed range of force for silanated surfaces was up to @xmath0 with the maximum attraction or adhesion ( normalized by radius of interacting surfaces ) about @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it has soon became clear that conventional theories of colloidal interactions fail to explain such a long - range effect  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that in some systems the hydrophobic attraction is associated with the nucleation of dissolved gas ( gas - filled nanobubbles or drying film ) at the surfaces  @xcite .",
    "when the surfaces become close , these form a gaseous bridge between them  @xcite , which generates the attractive capillary force .",
    "this scenario was confirmed indirectly , from the presence of the discontinuous steps in the force curves , variability in the jump separations , hysteresis between approach and retraction , and sensitivity to dissolved gas or another solute  @xcite , as well as from more direct experiments  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the conclusions made on the basis of experimental data , no consensus was achieved in the theoretical description of capillary interactions .",
    "although on purely thermodynamic ground cavitation is expected to occur between hydrophobic surfaces , both early theory  @xcite and later monte carlo study  @xcite predict that this should happen only when the separation becomes very small ( i.e. comparable to the range of van der waals force ) .",
    "the long - range capillary force was predicted only for a situation , where pre - existing hemispherical bubbles ( of height and radius comparable to the range of expected attraction ) are postulated on an isolated surface  @xcite .",
    "contrary to this , it has been shown that the pre - formed nanobubbles are unstable and tend to dissolve very fast  @xcite .",
    "this led to speculations that the hydrophobic attraction is essentially a non - equilibrium force  @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) _ nematic liquid crystals : _ an exotic , but rather important example of capillary bridging",
    "has recently been observed in nematic liquid crystals  @xcite . here",
    "the two phases forming the bridge are both liquids with approximately the same density ; the main difference between them is a degree of _ orientational _ molecular ordering : anisotropic molecules are orientationally _ disordered _ in an isotropic phase ; in a nematic phase they are oriented along some preferred orientation , called the director .",
    "the fact that the two phases have different symmetry implies that the nematic - isotropic transition is of the first - order  @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed  @xcite that , in the frame of the landau - de gennes mean - field approach , the bridge of the nematic phase is formed between two spherical particles immersed in an isotropic phase , once the system is close to the nematic - isotropic transition .",
    "\\(iii ) _ various mixtures : _ more complex in composition , strongly confined fluids , when brought close to the phase separation , often have similar features in the force - distance profiles : the force has an unprecedentedly long - range attraction with a clear hysteresis on retraction / approach .",
    "for instance , capillary bridging was observed in bicontinuous microemulsions  @xcite and in a solution of polymer mixtures  @xcite .",
    "the importance of capillary bridging as a possible driving force in colloidal systems  @xcite can not be overestimated .",
    "the formation of the condensate between the particles can trigger their aggregation and , as a result , flocculation in colloidal suspensions .",
    "small amount of added fluid generates , through capillary effect , strong adhesive forces between the grains of granular materials  @xcite .",
    "the direct optical measurements of the bridge parameters are impossible , due to its submicroscopic size .",
    "one can study only the indirect consequences , e.g. force - distance curves in afm or sfa experiments , and from there attempt to deduce some of the system properties .",
    "this requires theoretical modeling that fills in the gap .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the general consequences of the formation / annihilation of a capillary bridge upon change of the thermodynamical parameters or geometry of the system . considering that recent experimental results on capillary condensation / evaporation are performed using afm or sfa setups",
    ", we work in a sphere - plane geometry which is relevant for the above - mentioned techniques . we first treat the problem in a sharp - interface limit and derive simple analytical expressions for the structural phase diagram and forces in sec .",
    "[ sec : sharp_interface ] . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase_field ] , we use the landau mean - field approach and solve the full nonlinear equations for the bridge shape numerically . in the final section  [ sec : liquid_crystals ] , using simple mapping of the free energies , we discuss implication of our results to nematic liquid crystals .",
    "to begin with , we construct a crude analytical solution that will give us some qualitative picture of what is happening with the bridge when the geometry or thermodynamical parameters of the system change .",
    "the approach we shall follow was proposed by petrov  et .",
    "al .  @xcite . to keep the description as simple as possible",
    ", we neglect the internal structure of the interfaces .",
    "then our system involves domains of well - defined phases separated by infinitely thin interfaces , so called `` sharp - interface limit ''  @xcite .",
    "illustration of the studied geometry and bridge parametrization .",
    "condensate of the phase ( 1 ) is stabilized between the apex of the sphere and the flat substrate .",
    "axial symmetry is assumed throughout the paper.,width=188 ]    a geometry typical for sfa and afm measurements is depicted in fig  [ fig : geometry ] . at the moment of capillary condensation the condensed phase is formed between the apex of the sphere and the flat substrate . for convenience ,",
    "we denote the phase inside the bridge as a phase ( 1 ) and the bulk phase as a phase ( 2 ) .",
    "we also assume that the sphere and the plane are made of the same material and denote it as a phase ( 3 ) .",
    "then the excess free energy , i.e. the change in the free energy of the system due to the emergence of the phase ( 1 ) ( bridge ) out of the bulk phase can be written as the sum of the bulk and surface terms @xmath2 in the sharp - interface limit , the surface free energy @xmath3 is due to different surface tensions of the interfaces between the phases 1/3 and 2/3 , plus the energy of the interface between the phases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , which is proportional to the perimeter of the bridge @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the areas of the interfaces between the phases 1/3 and 1/2 correspondingly .",
    "additionally , we assume that the phase ( 1 ) wets the surfaces , i.e. the sphere and the plane are covered by thin wetting layers of the phase ( 1 ) .",
    "this implies that the phase ( 1 ) has zero contact angle and therefore , according to the young equation @xmath7 note that here we implicitly assumed that we are below the prewetting transition line , i.e. the layers of the metastable phase are thin and we can neglect their contribution to the total free energy .",
    "the bulk free energy is due to the difference in the chemical potentials of the phase - separated component inside the bridge and in the bulk @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the volume of the bridge .    to calculate the surface areas and the volume of the bridge , its circumference is approximated to a cylinder , instead of the correct , concave shape .",
    "similar approximation was used before  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the typical dimensions of the surfaces and separations of sfa experiments this approximation works very well  @xcite .",
    "the surface areas and the volume of the bridge then read @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new constant with dimension of length @xmath12 and scale out the variables with dimension of length by defining @xmath13 we also introduce a dimensionless radial extent of the bridge which plays a role of the order parameter in our system @xmath14.\\ ] ] with this notations , the excess free energy  ( [ eq : free_en ] ) can be written as @xmath15 for every fixed @xmath16 , the minimum of @xmath17 gives the equilibrium radius of the bridge .",
    "in what follows it will be understood that scaling  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) has been carried out , and we shall omit the tildes in the text below .     on the radial extent of the bridge for @xmath18 .",
    "three separations are shown : @xmath19 , when the bridge is stable ; @xmath20 , with metastable bridge ; @xmath21 , when the configuration with the bridge is unstable .",
    "[ fig : sharp_energy ] , width=302 ]    now that the mathematical problem is formulated , we first analyze the dependence of the excess free energy on the bridge radius @xmath22 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sharp_energy ] .",
    "it is similar to the landau free energy as it occurs for phase transitions with a scalar order parameter @xmath23 .",
    "it predicts a discontinuous transition between the bridged ( @xmath24 ) and unbridged ( @xmath25 ) configurations on approach / retraction of the sphere from the plane .",
    "the first - order character of the transition indicates possible jumps and hysteresis in force - distance curves measured in afm and sfa experiments  @xcite .",
    "let us now localize the transition line .",
    "the equilibrium radius of the bridge corresponds to the minimum of the excess free energy @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , the configuration with the bridge is energetically preferable if @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the following equations determine the transition line ( binodal in a thermodynamical sense ) @xmath28    the configuration with the bridge ( or without it ) can also be _",
    ", when it is a _ local _ minimum of the excess free energy .",
    "the corresponding metastability limits ( spinodals ) can be determined from the condition @xmath29    now that we have a criteria for the stability and the metastability of the bridge , eqns .",
    "( [ eq : binodal],[eq : spinodal ] ) , let us have a look at the dependence of the bridge radius @xmath30 on the sphere - plane separation , @xmath31 . if we differentiate the excess free energy @xmath26 with respect to @xmath23 , we find that the extrema of the free energy are solutions of the implicit equation for the bridge radius @xmath32 these solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rb_h ] for several values of the sphere radius @xmath33 . as anticipated , there are two solutions for each separation @xmath34 , which correspond to two extrema of the excess free energy ( see fig .",

    "the larger of these two values corresponds to the minimum of the free energy ; its value defines the radius of the stable ( or metastable ) bridge .",

    "( [ eq : binodal ] ) , and the metastability line , eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinodal ] ) , are shown in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "it confirms that for small sphere radii the configuration with the bridge becomes unstable almost immediately , for very small sphere - plane separations .",
    "as the radius of the sphere grows , the transition occurs at much larger separations , approaching @xmath41 for @xmath42 . as a result",
    ", our model predicts that bridging is not possible for @xmath43 .",
    "the same conclusion was made in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "[ fig : diagram ] , width=302 ]    after the structural phase diagram is calculated , let us have a look at the force - distance curves .",
    "the interaction force can be calculated from the free energy @xmath47 and , together with equation  ( [ eq : h_x ] ) , provides the force - distance curves written in parametric form .    .",

    "[ fig : sharp_force ] , together with metastability limits and the transition line .",
    "it quantifies our previous conclusion that the transition is of the first order : for small separations the configuration with the bridge is stable and gives rise to practically linear increase of the force with separation . at the transition point",
    "this configuration becomes metastable and the bridge can disappear as soon as the fluctuations of the bridge radius are big enough to destroy it .",
    "finally , at even larger separations , the bridge becomes completely unstable and disappears .",
    "there is no interaction between the sphere and the plane from this point on and the force jumps to the zero value .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the sphere approaches the surface , the configuration without the bridge is stable ( metastable ) up to the zero separation .",
    "therefore , the largest hysteresis in force - distance curves on approach / retraction is given by @xmath35 .    before presenting the numerical results ,",
    "let us briefly recall the main conclusions .",
    "assuming that the interface is infinitely sharp and the bridge has a cylindrical shape , we are able to see the first - order structural transition between the configurations with and without the bridge .",
    "structural phase diagram reveals that for small sphere radii the transition occurs almost immediately , for small sphere - surface separations . on the other hand , even for large sphere radii , bridging is not possible for @xmath48 . the first - order nature of the transition leads to hysteresis in the the force - distance curves on approach / retraction of the sphere from the surface .",
    "the attractive force is basically proportional to the separation , with small deviations close to the transition line .",
    "it is clear that even the primitive model considered above allows a qualitatively rich description of the transition . however , there are still several important details missing , on the first place : ( i ) the non - cylindrical shape of the bridge ; ( ii ) the finite thickness of the interface ; ( iii ) the interaction between the fluid and the solid walls .",
    "inclusion of these corrections makes the problem rather involved and does not allow anymore for a simple analytical solution . in what follows we use numerical methods to tackle the problem .      to describe the bulk phase as well as the interface structure , mean - field theories  @xcite",
    "are often used . in this approach",
    "the order parameter @xmath49 is introduced . for a liquid - vapour model",
    "@xmath49 is just the density . for a binary mixture @xmath49",
    "is a composition variable , defined as @xmath50 , where the @xmath51 are the number densities of the two species .",
    "this order parameter varies slowly in the bulk regions and rapidly on length scales of the interfacial width .",

    "are added to the free energy @xcite .",
    "we shall note that the surface terms are very important : they give rise to a prewetting transition and , together with @xmath54 , determine the thickness of the wetting layer .",
    "however , the prewetting transition occurs only in the vicinity of the _ bulk _ phase separation ( binodal ) , i.e. close to @xmath55 , while capillary bridging can be observed in the whole region of the phase diagram between the spinodal and the binodal . to avoid additional complications related to the wetting / prewetting transitions",
    ", we assume that our system is below the prewetting transition line ( i.e. we have thin wetting films ) and fix the surface value of the order parameter to its bulk value in the infinite system",
    ".    the explicit form of the helmholtz free energy @xmath53 varies depending on the type of mixture .",
    "however , the simple observation that the two phases must coexist implies that there are two minima in the free energy at the respective values of the order parameter .",
    "here we adopt the mean - field model for a symmetric mixture @xcite @xmath56 note that this is one of the simplest models to describe unmixing ; a more realistic description would need a more sophisticated function , which also takes into account a dependence on the overall density .",
    "the term @xmath57 is needed to provide spatial structure to the theory : at phase coexistence , there are two bulk equilibrium order parameter values @xmath58 and @xmath59 with the same free energy density , @xmath60 . without the gradient term , a structure with a large number of interfaces between the @xmath58 and @xmath59 phase would be entropically favored .",
    "the term @xmath61 is the simplest one which penalizes interfaces .",
    "while this is justified near the critical point , where interfaces are very wide and the order parameter varies smoothly , a more realistic description at strong segregation ( where the interface becomes rather sharp ) would require higher  order gradients , too .    for the free energy  ( [ eq : f_rm ] ) the binodal is given by @xmath62 .",
    "two spinodals ( metastability limits ) are located at @xmath63 .",
    "finally , we should take into account the interaction between the solid walls and the fluid . to simplify our model ,",
    "we have chosen an interaction that acts locally at the solid - fluid interface , imposing fixed boundary conditions at the walls , @xmath64 .",
    "the phase - field models are very convenient because no explicit boundary tracking is needed .",
    "however , they are wasteful in terms of simulating bulk regions .",
    "one can remedy the situation by taking into account that the order parameter varies slowly in bulk regions and rapidly on length scales of the order of the correlation length , near the interfaces .",
    "in this situation , finite elements method with adaptive mesh size solves the problem of computational efficiency : fine meshing is used only in the interfacial regions ; bulk regions are coarse - grained and have much larger size of finite elements .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of the order parameter @xmath49 is obtained by minimizing the free energy functional  ( [ eq : grand_pot ] ) numerically using finite elements with adaptive meshes . during the minimization",

    "the difference between the phase - field and the sharp - interface approaches for @xmath118 is , of course , expected , since the infinitely sharp interface assumption breaks down when the radius of the sphere is of the order of the correlation length @xmath87 .",
    "it is then tempting to explain the absence of a jump in computer simulations  @xcite , where the system sizes are typically limited to thousands of angstroms .    to calculate the transition line , we fitted the free energy profiles with a simple polynomial dependence ( quadratic polynomial turned out to be a reasonable approximation ) and found where it intersects the @xmath119 axis .",
    "this allows accurate determination of the transition line .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , together with the structural phase diagram obtained in the sharp - interface limit .",
    "the agreement above the critical point is reasonable , taking into account that we made rather crude approximations about the shape of the bridge in the sharp interface limit .",
    "force - distance curves calculated for several dimensionless sphere radii @xmath115 .",
    "inset shows the slope of the curves @xmath120 vs the sphere radius @xmath33.,width=302 ]    we have thus seen that the excess free energy profiles , scaled out by the sphere radius , are accurately fitted by a quadratic polynomial . for large @xmath115",
    "these profiles have _ convex _",
    "shape pointing that the attractive force , which is the first derivative of the excess free energy with respect to the sphere - plane separation , _ decreases linearly _ with the increase of the sphere - plane separation .",
    "it can be also seen that the free energy profiles , when scaled out by @xmath33 , are almost parallel to each other , especially for @xmath121 .",
    "this means that the _ slope _ of the force , scaled by the sphere radius @xmath33 , approaches asymptotically a constant value when @xmath122 . for smaller @xmath115",
    "the force profiles become first _ linear _ in @xmath31 and then start to curve inwards , changing their shape to _ concave_. as a result , the force is independent of @xmath31 for some particular sphere radius ; for even smaller @xmath115 it _ increases _ with the increase of @xmath31 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : force ] , where we show the force - distance curves calculated for @xmath123 .",
    "the inset shows the slope @xmath120 obtained from the linear fit @xmath124 note that here both @xmath33 and @xmath31 are dimensionless , i.  e. given in units of @xmath87 .",
    "the fit confirms that for @xmath125 we have a constant slope @xmath126 , i.e. the force simply scales with the sphere radius @xmath33 , like in the derjaguin approximation  @xcite .",
    "we studied two more situations , with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the transition lines for both cases are also shown on the structural phase diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] . for @xmath129",
    "the agreement with the sharp interface limit is remarkably better . at the same time",
    ", it is clearly worse for @xmath130 : the transition line is shifted toward bigger separations and ends in a critical point for rather large @xmath131 .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , the shape of the bridge is , in fact , a surface of revolution whose mean curvature is constant . these surfaces are known as delaunay surfaces , or onduloids  @xcite .",
    "@xmath93 defines the `` radius of curvature '' of the bridge cross - section through its symmetry axis . if @xmath132 the bridge is well approximated by a cylinder .",
    "this explains good agreement with the sharp interface limit for @xmath133 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath134 the radius of curvature is of the order of the interface thickness , i.e. the sharp interface limit can not be used , even if @xmath135 .    in spite of the complications in the structural phase diagram for @xmath134 and @xmath136 , the main conclusions of our numerical studies",
    "remain : the transition between bridged and unbridged configurations is of the first order ; the transition line ends in a critical point located at @xmath137 . for large spheres , @xmath138 ,",
    "the force is a linear function of the sphere - plane separation @xmath31 with a slope proportional to the sphere radius @xmath33 .",
    "in the previous sections a theoretical and numerical analysis of the bridge formation and stability has been developed for a simple binary mixture . here",
    "we discuss implication of our results for several different systems .",
    "we begin with nematic liquid crystals , mentioned in introduction . from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", the system is described by the landau - de gennes free energy  @xcite @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the bulk free energy density , @xmath141 is the elastic free energy density and @xmath142 is the surface free energy . within a mesoscopic approach",
    "the minimum of the landau - de gennes functional @xmath143 gives the equilibrium value of the tensor order parameter @xmath144 .",
    "symmetry arguments yield for the local bulk free energy density  @xcite @xmath145 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : f_b}\\ ] ] where @xmath146 is assumed to depend linearly on the temperature , while the positive constants @xmath147 are taken temperature independent .",
    "it is convenient to scale out the variables by defining @xmath148 it will be understood that such scaling has been carried out , and we shall omit the overbars in the text below .",
    "we also introduce a dimensionless temperature @xmath149 by defining @xmath150    the elastic free energy density can be written as  @xcite @xmath151 where the constants @xmath152 and @xmath153 are related to frank - oseen elastic constants by @xmath154 and @xmath155 and @xmath156 is the bulk nematic order parameter .",
    "the sign of @xmath153 defines the preferred orientation of the director at the ni interface .",
    "@xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) favors planar ( perpendicular ) anchoring  @xcite .",
    "now that the full free energy is specified , we perform several simplifications . to begin with we neglect the non - uniformity of the director distribution inside the bridge .",
    "this assumption is quite reasonable for the studied geometry : we assume homeotropic ( perpendicular ) anchoring of the director at the surfaces and planar ( parallel ) anchoring at the nematic - isotropic interface .",
    "second , we assume that the nematic phase is uniaxial and neglect the biaxiality of the interface . the full problem has been considered recently by stark et .",
    "al .  @xcite .    for a _ uniform uniaxial _",
    "nematic ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) the free energy ( [ eq : f_b ] ) takes the form @xmath161 free energy ( [ eq : nem_uni_f ] ) predicts that the nematic state is stable when @xmath162 with a degree of orientational order given by @xmath163 the same expression provides us with the metastability limit of the nematic phase on heating at @xmath164 .    the solution which corresponds to a free interface is then given by the de  gennes ansatz  @xcite , @xmath165 where @xmath87 is the nematic correlation length when the director is parallel to the interface @xmath166    a linear transformation of the order parameter , @xmath167 , reduces the ansatz  ( [ eq : ord_interface ] ) to the familiar form  ( [ eq : interface_sol ] ) .",
    "the same substitution transforms the free energy of a uniaxial nematic to the free energy of a binary mixture @xmath168/16.\\ ] ] close to the nematic - isotropic transition , @xmath169 , the @xmath149-dependence of the coefficient at @xmath170 is not important , and the free energy has exactly the same form as ( [ eq : phase_lambda ] ) provided that @xmath171 this is an interesting result : recalling that the nematic - isotropic transition occurs at @xmath169 and the superheating temperature of the nematic phase @xmath164 we see that @xmath172 , i.e. @xmath93 spans the whole range of values , from the interface thickness @xmath87 at the superheating temperature , to the system sizes , set by the sphere radius @xmath33 and the sphere - plane separation @xmath31 , and diverges at the nematic - isotropic transition .",
    "this implies that , depending on the temperature , one can have either discontinuous ( first - order ) or continuous transition between bridged and unbridged configurations .",
    "moreover , by changing the temperature of the liquid crystal it is possible to control the range and the strength of the attractive force between the particles in colloidal suspensions .",
    "another ` liquid crystalline ' example for which our results are relevant is drag of colloidal particles by the nematic - isotropic interface .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite revealed that the nematic - isotropic interface is able to drag colloidal particles and , as a result , form spatial patterns in the liquid crystal cell .",
    "theoretical reexamination of the experimental data  @xcite demonstrated that the force exerted on a colloidal particle is proportional to the penetration depth , and the slope of the force scales as the particle size @xmath33 .",
    "this points to rather unexpected mapping : here the bridge connects the colloidal particle and the interface itself , since the position of the latter is fixed by a small temperature gradient present in the system .",
    "the straightforward implication of our results , which is also confirmed experimentally  @xcite , is that it is more difficult for the interface to capture small particles .",
    "indeed , the attractive force from the side of the interface scales with radius .",
    "in addition , the barrier becomes smaller , completely vanishing at the critical radius @xmath117 .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the standard flory - huggins expression for a free energy of an incompressible polymer mixture  @xcite can be expanded in powers of the polymer volume fraction @xmath49 .",
    "close to the critical point it has the same form as ( [ eq : f_rm ] ) with @xmath173 , @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the flory - huggins parameter , @xmath176 is the effective chain length .",
    "this means that the whole picture of bridging , described here , can be adapted for the case of incompressible polymer mixtures .",
    "in fact , the capillary - induced phase separation in binary polymer solutions has been experimentally observed  @xcite and theoretically studied using mean - field lattice modeling  @xcite .    in many ways",
    "the interface acts like a membrane under tension . in our particular situation",
    "the formation of a bridge between the surface and a particle resembles the process of wrapping a colloidal particle by a membrane  @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison requires , however , further analysis .    as a final remark",
    ", we remind that , by using rigid boundary conditions , we will not observe possible prewetting transitions which have been studied in detail for simpler geometries  @xcite . these transitions",
    "normaly occur close to the bulk phase separation , i.e. when @xmath177 , or @xmath178 .",
    "the corresponding part of the phase diagram ( @xmath179 ) can , therefore , be affected by these effects . on the other hand , when @xmath42 , we recover the capillary condensation in a slab geometry  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the critical point has similar to the capillary condensation origin : it occurs when the interfacial width is comparable to the sphere - plane separation , i.  e. to the width of the capillary .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a detailed study of interactions between the sphere and the plane due to formation of the capillary bridge between them .",
    "we have shown that the structural transition between the configurations with and without the bridge is discontinuous and ends in a critical point for small particle radii .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the attractive force is long - ranged and is basically proportional to the sphere - plane separation and possible hysteresis on approach / separation .",
