    "this means that every finite time - interval contains only a finite number of surgery times .",
    "furthermore , he proved that if the given manifold is a homotopy sphere ( or , more generally , a connected sum of prime , non - aspherical manifolds ) , then this flow goes extinct in finite time and the total number of surgeries is finite .",
    "this fact implies that the initial manifold is a sphere if it is simply connected and hence proves the poincar conjecture . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ricci flow with surgery continues to exist for infinite time , perelman showed that the manifold decomposes into a thick part , which approaches a hyperbolic metric , and a thin part , which becomes arbitrarily collapsed on local scales .",
    "based on this collapse , it is then possible to show that the thin part can be decomposed into pieces whose topology is well understood ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "eventually , this decomposition can be reorganized to a geometric decomposition , thus establishing the geometrization conjecture .",
    "observe that although the ricci flow with surgery was used to solve such hard problems , some of its basic properties are still unknown , because they surprisingly turned out to be irrelevant in the end .",
    "for example , it was only conjectured by perelman that in the long - time existent case there are finitely many surgeries , i.e. that after some time the flow can be continued by a conventional smooth , non - singular ricci flow defined up to time infinity .",
    "furthermore , it is still unknown whether and in what way precisely the ricci flow exhibits the full geometric decomposition of the manifold .    in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "lott and lott - sesum gave a description of the long - time behavior of certain non - singular ricci flows on manifolds whose geometric decomposition consists of a single component .",
    "however , they needed to make additional curvature and diameter or symmetry assumptions . in @xcite , the author proved that under a purely topological condition ( sometimes referred to as @xmath7 ) , which roughly states that the manifold only consists of hyperbolic components , the number of surgeries is indeed finite and the curvature is bounded by @xmath0 for large @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we remove this additional condition and only assume that the initial manifold is closed and orientable .",
    "this series of papers is a restructured version of the two preprints @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the condition @xmath7 was generalized to a far more general topological condition @xmath8 , which requires that the non - hyperbolic pieces in the geometric decomposition of the underlying manifold contain sufficiently many incompressible surfaces .",
    "for example , manifolds of the form @xmath9 for closed , orientable surfaces @xmath10 , in particular the @xmath2-torus @xmath11 , satisfy property @xmath8 , but the heisenberg manifold does not .",
    "we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 1.2 ) for a precise definition and discussion of the conditions @xmath7 and @xmath8 . eventually , in @xcite the result was further generalized and condition @xmath8 was removed .",
    "this generalization was obtained by replacing said incompressible surfaces by simplicial complexes in a careful way . in the present paper",
    "we have merged the proofs of @xcite and @xcite , so the conditions @xmath12 as well as the incompressible surfaces do nt play a role anymore .",
    "we now state our main result . the notions relating to",
    "`` ricci flows with surgery '' that are used in the following are explained in subsection [ sec : defrfsurg ] of the following paper @xcite .",
    "a ricci flow @xmath13 on a manifold @xmath14 is a smooth family of riemannian metrics that satisfy the evolution equation @xmath15 a `` ricci flow with surgery @xmath16 , that is performed by @xmath17-precise cutoff '' can briefly be described as a sequence of 3 dimensional ricci flows @xmath18 ( m^2 , ( g^2_t)_{t \\in [ t^1 , t^2 ) } ) , \\ldots$ ] such that the time-@xmath19 slice @xmath20 is obtained from the singular metric @xmath21 on @xmath22 by a so called surgery process , which amounts to a geometric version of an inverse connected sum decomposition at a scale less than @xmath23 and the removal of spherical or @xmath24 components .",
    "we allow the case in which there are only finitely many surgery times @xmath19 and in which @xmath25 for the final index @xmath26 .",
    "observe that we have chosen our notion such that a @xmath17-precise cutoff is also @xmath27-precise if @xmath28 .",
    "in @xcite perelman showed the existence of a ( non - explicit ) function @xmath17 such that every normalized riemannian manifold @xmath3 ( see definition [ def : normalized ] in the next paper @xcite ) can be evolved into a ricci flow with surgery @xmath16 that is performed by @xmath17-precise cutoff - cutoff .",
    "for example , he performs surgeries at a scale @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is another function that goes to @xmath32 as @xmath1 .",
    "both notions are however equivalent modulo the choice of a different function @xmath17 . ] and he proved that for any such ricci flow with surgery  performed by @xmath17-precise cutoff and with normalized initial conditions  the surgery times @xmath19 do not accumulate .",
    "so if there were infinitely many surgery times ( or , equivalently , infinitely many surgeries ) , then we must have @xmath33 .",
    "our main result now states that this can not happen under normalized initial conditions and if @xmath17 has been chosen sufficiently small .",
    "note that these two conditions are not very restrictive since they already had been imposed in perelman s work .",
    "note that this curvature bound is optimal apart from the non - explicit constant @xmath5 .",
    "for example , if we consider a ricci flow on a hyperbolic manifold , then the sectional curvature behaves like @xmath42 as @xmath1 .",
    "we mention two interesting direct consequences of theorem [ thm : maintheorem - iii ] , which can be expressed in a completely elementary way and which illustrate the power of this theorem .",
    "none of these results have been proven so far to the author s knowledge .",
    "the first consequence is just a restatement of theorem [ thm : maintheorem - iii ] in the case in which @xmath16 is non - singular .",
    "note that even in this particular case our proof does not simplify significantly apart from the fact that we do nt have to deal with various technicalities .",
    "in fact , the reader is advised to only consider non - singular ricci flows upon first reading of this series of papers .",
    "this corollary can be deduced from theorem [ thm : maintheorem - iii ] as follows : any normalized riemannian metric @xmath48 on an aspherical manifold @xmath14 , can be evolved into a long - time existent ricci flow with surgery @xmath16 on the time - interval @xmath49 that is performed by @xmath17-precise cutoff , due to perelman ( @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition [ prop : rfwsurg - existence ] ) ) .",
    "the topological condition ensures that all surgeries on @xmath16 are trivial and hence that every time - slice of @xmath16 has a component that is diffeomorphic to @xmath14 . by theorem [ thm : maintheorem - iii ] ,",
    "there is a final surgery time @xmath50 on @xmath16 .",
    "so the flow @xmath16 restricted to the time - interval @xmath51 is non - singular and the underlying manifold is diffeomorphic to @xmath14 .",
    "shifting this flow in time by @xmath52 yields the desired ricci flow .",
    "the reverse direction is well known , for example it is a direct consequence of proposition [ prop : irreducibleafterfinitetime ] in the last paper of series , @xcite , and finite - time extinction ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the course of the proof of theorem [ thm : maintheorem - iii ] we will obtain a more detailed description of the geometry of the time - slices @xmath40 for large times @xmath6 . in short , we will find that as @xmath1 the ricci flow decomposes the manifold into regions that are hyperbolic or exhibit different collapsing behavior at scale @xmath53 .",
    "the collapse can either be observed on the whole manifold , in which case we speak of a _ total collapse _ and the underlying manifold is a quotient of a torus or a heisenberg manifold . or it occurs along incompressible ( i.e. @xmath54-injective ) circle ( @xmath55 ) or @xmath56-torus ( @xmath57 ) fibers .",
    "a collapse along @xmath55-fibers gives rise to seifert structures ( compare with the white regions @xmath58 in figure [ fig : longtimepicture ] ) .",
    "regions that collapse along @xmath57-fibers look like @xmath59 or like a twisted interval bundle over the klein bottle ( compare with the gray regions @xmath60 in figure [ fig : longtimepicture ] ) . those regions either cover the whole manifold , in which case the manifold is a quotient of a @xmath56-torus bundle over a circle , or they serve as interpolations between different seifert fibrations .",
    "by this we mean the following : a region @xmath61 that collapses along the @xmath57 factor is adjacent to two regions @xmath62 that carry seifert fibrations .",

    "along which @xmath63 collapses becomes so large that on @xmath64 or @xmath65 we only observe a collapse along the other @xmath55-direction .",
    "this decomposition of the underlying manifold into regions that are hyperbolic or seifert corresponds to a geometric decomposition as defined in definition [ def : geomdec ] of the third paper in this series , @xcite . however , this decomposition is not necessarily minimal , i.e. it may a priori be possible to simplify it by fusing together certain seifert structures .",

    "consider the case in which @xmath144 , where @xmath10 is a surface of genus @xmath145 . then a priori , there is no bound on @xmath146 that only depends on the topology of @xmath80 , since a geometric decomposition can be induced from cutting @xmath10 along arbitrarily many pairwise disjoint , embedded , non - contractible loops . if the number of these loops is large enough , then some components in their complement are annuli and hence some of the @xmath114 are diffeomorphic to @xmath59 .",

    "in other words , in the following we will sketch the proof of corollary [ cor : nonsingflow ] .",
    "for this , we have to recall an important result of perelman , which in this outline we will refer to as the `` key lemma '' .",

    "motivated by this key lemma , perelman decomposes the manifold @xmath14 into a _ thick _ part @xmath183 and a _ thin _",

    "we mean the following : consider the universal cover @xmath192 of @xmath14 and pull back the family of metrics @xmath81 to @xmath193 via the projection map @xmath194 .",
    "then these pull - backs @xmath195 still satisfy the ricci flow equation .",

    "this is why we need the collapse in @xmath213 to occur along fibers that are _ incompressible in @xmath14_. we explain briefly , why it seems unlikely to prove such a curvature bound assuming this more general volume bound : in order to prove such a bound , we would have to pass to a ( local ) cover of @xmath212 . the proof of perelman s key lemma",
    "can only be carried out in such a local cover , if we can ensure that all its estimates only take place very close to @xmath168 .",

    "figure [ fig : expandingsolidtorus ] illustrates this problem . here the ball @xmath212 has fundamental group @xmath214 , as does the region that is diffeomorphic to @xmath59 , but this region is contained in a union of two regions , which as a whole is diffeomorphic to a solid torus @xmath205 and hence has fundamental group @xmath215 . in other words , the homotopy classes corresponding to one of the @xmath215 factors of the fundamental group of the left region are `` destroyed '' by the right region . since we do nt know whether the right region is disjoint from the ball @xmath216 at the earlier time @xmath217 , we can not pass to an appropriate local cover .",

    "it is in fact possible to localize perelman s key lemma .",
    "the reason why we can do this comes from the fact that the part of @xmath14 that `` destroys '' certain homotopy classes of the @xmath59 regions stays sufficiently far away from this region for a short but uniform time - interval .",
    "so we conclude that there are pairwise disjoint , embedded solid tori @xmath232 , @xmath233 such that @xmath234 note that the number and position of the solid tori @xmath235 depends on @xmath6 .",

    "this analysis requires further generalizations of perelman s arguments in the collapsing case , e.g. bounded curvature at bounded distance results . a major goal of this analysis is to show that a behavior as illustrated in figure [ fig : expandingsolidtorus ] can not occur .",
    "this will allow us to apply a localized version of perelman s key lemma yielding curvature control on large collar neighborhoods of those @xmath236 whose diameter is large .",
    "we refer to the introduction of the last paper of this series , @xcite , for further details on the analysis of the solid tori @xmath236 .",
    "a major ingredient that is used in this analysis is the fact that , in most cases , the solid tori @xmath236 admit compressing disks of bounded area . by this",
    "we mean that for every solid torus @xmath236 we can find a map @xmath237 with the following properties : @xmath238 and @xmath239 parameterizes a loop that is non - contractible in @xmath240 ( but contractible in @xmath14 ) .",
    "moreover , the time-@xmath6 area of @xmath241 , is @xmath242 for some uniform constant @xmath93 that only depends on the topology of @xmath14 . these compressing disks roughly arise from the intersection of @xmath236 with certain `` minimal simplicial complexes '' , whose area is bounded by @xmath243 for some other uniform @xmath244 .",
    "note that both the area bound for these `` minimal simplicial complexes '' and the extraction of said compressing disks are two non - trivial steps in our proof and occupy most of the second and third paper , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , unfortunately , the extraction of the compressing disk seems to fail in the special case in which @xmath14 is topologically a quotient of a @xmath56-torus bundle over a circle . in this case",
    ", we employ a different argument , which makes use of the special topology of @xmath14 .    taking all these facts into account ,",
    "the analysis of the @xmath236 yields the following conclusion for each @xmath26 : either the diameter of @xmath236 is bounded by a constant of the form @xmath245 and the curvature on @xmath236 is bounded by a constant of the form @xmath222 or the diameter of @xmath236 is larger than @xmath245 and the solid torus @xmath236 persists in a certain sense if we go backwards in the flow on a long time - interval of the form @xmath227 $ ] .",
    "moreover , after passing to a smaller solid torus , we find a loop @xmath246 that is non - contractible in @xmath240 , but contractible in @xmath14 , that is short and whose geodesic curvature is sufficiently controlled on the whole time - interval @xmath227 $ ] .",
    "this loop can be chosen such that it spans a disk @xmath247 of area @xmath248 at time @xmath228 .",
    "see figure [ fig : picturewithsi ] for an illustration of these two cases .",
    "we can finally rule out the second case using a minimal disk argument , which is due to hamilton .",
    "this argument implies that the loop @xmath249 can only be short and have bounded geodesic curvature on a maximal time - interval of the form @xmath250 $ ] , where @xmath251 only depends on @xmath252 .",
    "this bound follows from a computation that implies that the area of a minimal disk that is spanned by the given loop has to go to zero before time @xmath253 . as a result ,",
    "hamilton s minimal disk argument yields a contradiction if @xmath254 is chosen small enough such that @xmath255 .",
    "this implies that the diameter of each @xmath236 must be bounded by @xmath245 and hence the curvature is bounded by @xmath222 on each @xmath236 .",
    "we hence obtain the desired curvature bound on the last remaining part of @xmath14 , concluding the proof of the main theorem .",
    "note that the choice of constants @xmath256 and @xmath254 is highly non - trivial .",
    "in this paper we define precisely what we mean by `` ricci flows with surgery and precise cutoff '' . the definition is chosen such that it incorporates most of the common notions of ricci flows with surgery .",
    "then we review perelman s analysis of these flows",
    ". we will carry out some of perelman s arguments again and generalize them to the case in which the underlying manifold is non - compact or has a boundary .",
    "then we prove various generalizations of perelman s long - time estimates in the collapsing case .",
    "these include several versions and localizations of the generalized key lemma as mentioned above .",
    "this paper deals with area bounds of minimal surfaces or simplicial complexes under the ricci flow . we will show that minimal simplicial complexes are bounded by @xmath243 in area and we will recall hamilton s minimal disk argument , as well as a version of his argument for spheres .      in this paper ,",
    "first recall several facts from the topology of @xmath2-manifolds .",
    "then we construct the ( topological ) simplicial complex to which we will apply the area estimate from the previous paper .",
    "the simplicial complex is chosen in such a way that , in many cases , it is possible to extract a disk from its intersection with an arbitrary incompressible solid torus .",
    "this fact is surprisingly non - trivial and it s proof occupies the major part of the paper .      in this paper",
    "we assemble the results obtained in the previous papers and we finish the proofs of theorems [ thm : maintheorem - iii ] and [ thm : geombehavior ] .",
    "the paper contains the geometric characterization of the thin part @xmath191 and a topological discussion of its decomposition .",
    "we will then understand its fragmentation into good and bad parts and use the results of paper a to deduce the desired curvature bound first outside the solid tori @xmath257 , as mentioned in the outline , then on those @xmath236 of bounded diameter and eventually on collar neighborhoods of those @xmath236 of large diameter .",
