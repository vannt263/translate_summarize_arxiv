    "a few of the basic building blocks of particle physics are the assumptions that nature preserves local lorentz invariance and hence the special theory of relativity , the product of the discrete symmetries cpt and the equivalence principle .",
    "it is also true that to date we have not seen any violation of any of these laws . in recent times",
    "many new attempts have been made to obtain new and quantifiable information on the degree of validity of these basic laws .",
    "it is in this connection that we plan to investigate the kaon  system .",
    "many experiments have tested the special theory of relativity to a high degree of precision @xcite .",
    "these experiments probe for any dependence of the ( non - gravitational ) laws of physics on a laboratory s position , orientation or velocity relative to some preferred frame of reference , such as the frame in which the cosmic microwave background is isotropic .",
    "failure to observe such dependence further enhances the validity of ( respectively ) local position invariance and local lorentz invariance ( lli ) , and hence of the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) @xcite .",
    "however , these empirical results have been obtained primarily in the baryon - photon sector of the standard model .",
    "there is no logically necessary reason to conclude from these results that the special theory of relativity must be valid in all sectors of the standard model of elementary particle physics .",
    "its validity must be empirically checked for each sector ( gauge boson , neutrino , massive lepton , _ etc .",
    "_ ) separately @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of lli violation ( vli ) is that every species of matter has its own maximum attainable speed .",
    "this yields several novel effects in various sectors of the standard model @xcite , including vacuum cerenkov radiation @xcite , photon decay @xcite and neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "recently we extended these arguments and pointed out that violation of special relativity will in general induce an energy dependent @xmath10 mass difference @xcite ; an empirical search for such effects can therefore be used to obtain bounds on vli in the kaon sector of the standard model . as we shall discuss later vli in the kaon sector",
    "can occur in a manner that may or may not violate cpt .",
    "the eep implies universality of gravitational coupling for all forms of mass - energy , thereby ensuring that spacetime is described by a unique operational geometry .",
    "an extreme converse of this principle is that every form of stress - energy couples to its own metric , so that the lagrangian for the standard model is modified to be one of the form @xmath11 where each matter field @xmath12 couples to its own metric @xmath13 .",
    "the gravitational lagrangian density @xmath14 describes the behaviour of all of these metrics in the absence of any matter fields .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath15 describes the interaction between the different matter fields ; it will in general include at least some subset of the metric fields @xmath13 .",
    "although such a lagrangian is generally covariant , spacetime no longer has a unique operational geometry , since clocks and measuring rods constructed out of different types of matter fields will in general yield different results for a given set of experiments that depend on the choice of coordinate frame .",
    "furthermore , while it is possible for any given metric @xmath13 to interpret a diffeomorphism of the manifold as a gauge transformation of the linearized tensor @xmath16 where @xmath17 is some reference metric ( typically chosen to be a flat metric ) , this can not be done simultaneously for all the metrics ( unless they are all the same ) .",
    "this means that the spin modes of all the other metrics will in general be excited .",
    "it is then a theoretical challenge to ensure that the excitations of the additional degrees of freedom of the other metric do not yield unacceptable pathologies such as runaway negative energy solutions , tachyons , etc .",
    "one might imagine doing this by giving , say , the gravitons associated with the metrics a tiny mass , save for the metric associated with ordinary stable matter .",
    "more general theoretical mechanisms than that given in ( [ introeq ] ) can also be considered : for example some of the metrics may not be describable by second rank tensor fields , or some sectors of the theory may not even be lagrangian - based . for an overview and further discussion of the different possibilities ,",
    "@xcite .    from an empirical perspective",
    ", the validity of the eep must therefore be checked sector - by - sector in the standard model , since it can not be imposed on grounds of logic . although the eep has been tested to impressive levels of precision , virtually all such tests have been carried out with matter fields .",
    "the possibility that matter and antimatter may have different gravitational couplings remains a fascinating open question .",
    "the strongest bound on matter - antimatter gravitational universality comes from the @xmath18 system .",
    "recent studies of this system have considered a straightforward violation of the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) in which it is assumed that @xmath19 mass and gravitational eigenstates can be simultaneously diagonalised but with differing eigenvalues ( _ i.e. _ differing @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses ) @xcite , in which case violation of gravitational universality also means violation of cpt .",
    "however , more generally , a violation of the eep ( vep ) in the kaon system will not assume simultaneous pairwise diagonalization of mass , gravitational or weak eigenstates .",
    "we shall consider in this article the consequences of such a general vep mechanism , showing that it can provide a source of @xmath2 violation whilst conserving cpt . in this context ,",
    "previously investigated mechanisms of eep violation in the kaon system may be considered either as special cases of maximal @xmath20 violation in the gravitational sector @xcite or else cpt conserved vep , which is the other extreme case @xcite .",
    "our analysis is more general , including all the earlier analyses as special cases and in addition allows us to compare with the vli bounds .",
    "we consider constraints imposed on this general vep mechanism by present experiments .",
    "in section 2 and 3 we derive the general mass matrix including vli and vep effects respectively . in both sections",
    "we point out that vli ( vep ) allows for a phase @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) responsible for @xmath2 violation whilst conserving @xmath20 . at the end of section 3",
    "we compare both general mass matrices noticing that vep and vli effects are indistinguishable as expected @xcite ( for the neutrino sector this similarity was pointed out in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in section 4 we discuss the general case where these phases are taken to be 0 .",
    "we consider first the @xmath20-conserving case and examine the energy dependence vli and vep induce in the mass difference @xmath23 .",
    "constraints on vep parameters ( and hence on vli parameters ) from experiments on @xmath23 are discussed .",
    "we also give constraints on the interesting maximally @xmath24violating case where matter or antimatter states are the velocity or gravitational eigenstates with differing eigenvalues .",
    "then in section 5 we discuss the effect of the phases @xmath21 and @xmath22 and constraints on vep and vli parameters from @xmath2 violation experiments .",
    "we point out that the @xmath2 violation induced by vep or vli is of the superweak type and has an inherent energy dependence . consequently , although this mechanism can not fully account for observed @xmath2 violation in the kaon system , it yields a definite testable prediction for the energy dependence of @xmath2 violation parameters .",
    "this can then be used to put a qualitatively new bound on vep or vli .",
    "we summarise our results in section 6 .",
    "the maximum attainable velocities of particles and antiparticles can differ if there is violation of lli @xcite . here",
    "we take a phenomenological approach to this problem and assume that neither the mass nor the weak eigenstates are a priori simultaneously diagonalisable with the momemtum eigenstates .",
    "then the general form of the effective hamiltonian associated with the lagrangian in the @xmath25 basis will be @xmath26 with , @xmath27 and @xmath28 to leading order in @xmath29 with p the momentum and @xmath30 the average mass . from now on we define @xmath31 , @xmath32 for any quantity @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 refers to the strong and electroweak part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 correspond to the maximum attainable speeds of each eigenstate .",
    "if special relativity is valid within the kaon sector these are both equal to their average @xmath37 , which we normalize to unity .",
    "hence @xmath38 is a measure of vli in the kaon sector .",

    "we observe that , except for a different experimental situation , the constraints obtained on @xmath212 and @xmath213 are similar to ours on the corresponding quantities , @xmath214 and @xmath215 respectively with @xmath79 = @xmath116 . from our treatment , we see consequently that provided the tensorial interaction is of gravitational origin the bounds on the parameters @xmath212 and @xmath213 are in fact bounds on a combination of the vep parameters , the difference @xmath103 in the gravitational couplings and the phase @xmath22 .",
    "we close this section by noting that the bounds on @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 above are also bounds on the corresponding vli parameters @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 respectively .",
    "the kaon system provides us with an interesting physical situation in which we can empirically check the validity of special relativity and/or the equivalence principle in a matter / antimatter sector of the standard model that includes 2nd generation matter .",
    "a variety of interesting combinations of vli / vep effects exist which can be associated with @xmath2 violation and/or @xmath20 violation .",
    "violations of the equivalence principle in the kaon system need not violate cpt ( which in turn implies a loss of locality in quantum field theory ) as considered in recent studies .",
    "a general feature of the vli / vep mechanisms is that they predict an energy dependence in @xmath23 and in the @xmath2 violation parameters which can be empirically tested to obtain bounds on the relevant parameters ( such as @xmath127 for vep or @xmath80 for vli ) .",
    "since both vep and vli have the same energy dependence , although we can obtain bounds for both , it will not be possible to experimentally distinguish between the two mechanisms . under the assumption that all such parameters are within two standard deviations over the energy scales at which they have been measured",
    ", present experiments provide rather stringent bounds on the vep ( or vli ) mechanism",
    ". a more systematic search for energy dependence in @xmath83 and in the @xmath2-violating parameters ( such as @xmath169 ) will provide us with more definitive information about the vep ( or vli ) mechanism in this sector .",
    "in addition in our formalism , we observe that the @xmath20-conserving case @xcite and the @xmath20-violating case of recent vep studies @xcite are special cases of the same general mechanism .        99 v.w .",
