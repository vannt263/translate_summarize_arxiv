    "the pioneering work of majumdar and ghosh showed this exactly in a spin-1/2 heisenberg chain  @xcite .",
    "similarly , there is a strong numerical support for the spin-1/2 @xmath8-@xmath9 model on square lattice to have non - magnetic columnar dimer ground state in the range of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the dimer ground states have been shown to occur in many other frustrated models on different lattices  @xcite .",
    "a dimer singlet ground state can also be realized by taking the antiferromagnetic exchange between the spins of selected pairs to be stronger than the rest .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : stg_model_fig ] denoting a heisenberg model on square lattice , a staggered pattern of thick nearest - neighbour bonds ( @xmath11 ) is taken to be stronger compared to the other interactions ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "the spin-1/2 case of this staggered - dimer model without @xmath13 has been studied by using the perturbative series expansion method  @xcite , exact diagonalization  @xcite , coupled cluster method  @xcite , and quantum monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",

    "has also been made on the basis of tensor network studies  @xcite .",
    "while the studies concerned with dimer states focus mostly on spin-1/2 problems , darradi _ et al _ made an interesting investigation of their dependence on spin quantum number , @xmath0 , in the unfrustrated ( @xmath15 ) staggered - dimer model  @xcite . using exact diagonalization , coupled - cluster method and variational mean - field approach , they studied the model for different values of @xmath0 , and tried to find how the critical coupling for the transition from staggered dimer to nel phase changes with @xmath0 . based on their calculations for upto @xmath16",

    "we find the ground state of this heisenberg model to undergo continuous phase transition from the staggered dimer to nel or collinear state , and the critical couplings for both the transitions to scale precisely as @xmath1 .",

    "it looks a bit unusual , but we know of one other case ( the famous shastry - sutherland model  @xcite ) in which the dimer ground state is exactly realized for arbitrarily large spins .",
    "thus , by helping the singlet phase to survive in the large @xmath0 limit , the frustration seems to be differentiating the classical limit of a quantum case from the classical case itself .",

    "here , we studied the quantum phase transitions in a frustrated staggered - dimer model for arbitrary spin-@xmath0 on square lattice by doing triplon mean - field theory , without and with single - ion anisotropy . in the purely heisenberg case    , we found two ordered phases , viz .",
    "nel and collinear states , sandwiching the spin - gapped staggered - dimer phase .",
    "the critical couplings for these transitions are found to scale precisely as @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , we also find that this quantum ( dimer ) phase , helped by strong frustration , persists even in the classical limit ( @xmath102 ) . in the presence of single - ion anisotropy",
    ", we first reworked the spin-@xmath0 bond - operator representation to include the effects of singlet - quintet mixing on a dimer .",
    "then , we used it to carry out the standard triplon analysis to work out the quantum phase diagram .",
    "interestingly , for any @xmath180 , we always find a critical value of the anisotropy , @xmath171 , for which the dimer phase between the nel and collinear phases vanishes .",
    "we also find that @xmath178 for large @xmath0 .",
    "thus , an infinitesimally small @xmath29 would be sufficient to kill the quantum mechanical dimer phase and establish classical order in the limit of very large @xmath0 . through this model calculation",
    ", we presented here an interesting perspective on the change of behaviour from quantum to classical in frustrated spin systems with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "it would to nice to check this in other models , and if possible , by emulating similar models using cold atoms in optical lattices  .",
