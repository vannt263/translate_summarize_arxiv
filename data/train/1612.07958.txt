    "quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a deconfined state of quarks and gluons , and is currently a subject of much theoretical and experimental research .",
    "qgp is produced in heavy - ion collisions , e.g. au@xmath0au collisions at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) or pb@xmath0pb collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments .",
    "some of the signatures of qgp include heavy quarkonium ( @xmath1 or @xmath4 ) suppression , collective flow and photon / dilepton production , etc .",
    "usually , heavy quarkonium is suppressed to a much larger extent , if qgp is formed  @xcite , in the heavy - ion collision experiments . however , at the lhc , @xmath1 yield may actually increase due to recombination  @xcite , which would obviously reduce the effective suppression .",
    "for proton - lead ( p@xmath0pb ) collisions , the heavy quarkonium yield may be explained using cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects itself  @xcite .",
    "however , these do not necessarily prove beyond reasonable doubt that qgp is not formed at p@xmath0pb collisions .",
    "if one were to look at peripheral collisions in heavy ion collisions  @xcite , it can be seen that most of the suppression mechanisms yield much smaller additional suppression though qgp is present .",
    "the central p@xmath0pb collisions have comparable energy , number of nuclear participants ( @xmath5 ) , and number of binary collisions ( @xmath6 ) as extreme peripheral heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the question then arises as to what would be a defining signature for p@xmath0pb collisions which indicates whether or not the qgp is formed in such a collision . in this work ,",
    "we attempt to explore the yield enhancement of the charmonium state @xmath2 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath1 , at high @xmath3 , as a possible indication of the presence of qgp .",
    "one possible explanation for yield enhancement is secondary recombination of @xmath7 and @xmath8 pair .",
    "however , secondary recombination is unlikely to be a reason for @xmath2 enhancement at high @xmath3 in the case of p@xmath0pb collision .",
    "this is because , both theoretical and experimental data indicate that recombination decreases at high @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "secondly , secondary recombination depends quadratically on the number of @xmath7 and @xmath8 pairs  @xcite , which would be very less for p@xmath0pb collision .",
    "we argue that a possible reason for @xmath2 enhancement could be due to the gluon induced excitation of @xmath9 to @xmath2 .",
    "we further argue that , in a medium of equilibrated gluon distribution , this gluon induced excitation increases with @xmath3 of @xmath1 .",
    "this can be understood in the following way .",
    "when the gluon medium achieves equilibrium , it would follow the bose - einstein distribution , which results in the concentration of gluons in the low energy regime .",
    "the gluon density would then decrease exponentially with gluon energy , @xmath10 .",
    "the mass difference between @xmath2 and @xmath9 is about @xmath11 gev , which needs to be provided by the gluon .",
    "but in a bose - einstein distribution , @xmath12 , at a temperature of around @xmath13 mev ( dissociation temperature of @xmath2 ) , most of the gluons would have much smaller energy than @xmath11 gev .",
    "however , for @xmath1 with large @xmath3 , there would be a blue - shift in the gluon energy in the @xmath1 frame of reference , in the forward direction , and a red - shift in the backward direction .",
    "we represent this doppler shift as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the relative velocity between the medium and @xmath1 , and @xmath16 is the scattering angle between @xmath15 and incoming gluon momentum .",
    "the subsequent bose - einstein distribution , then becomes @xmath17 .",
    "the modified bose - einstein , @xmath18 , leads to an exponential increase in the availability of gluons with energy around @xmath11 gev , leading to a significant number of @xmath1 getting excited to the @xmath2 state .",
    "the above effect is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : results](see figure  [ fig : doppler ] ) .",
    "thus , one would qualitatively expect that gluon induced excitation from @xmath9 to @xmath2 would increase with @xmath3 .",
    "we explore this analytically in this work , and compare the results with preliminary atlas data  @xcite at @xmath19 tev .",
    "the suppression effects are also included for the purpose of comparing with experimental data .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we draw our final conclusions .",
    "in this section , the cross - section @xmath21 and the excitation rate @xmath23 are calculated using the potential non - relativistic qcd ( pnrqcd ) formulation .",

    "the octet wave function , @xmath104 , is obtained by solving the schrdinger s equation with potential , @xmath105  @xcite .",

    "the centrality and time dependence of the temperature of the qgp medium is taken as  @xcite @xmath109 the values for @xmath5 and @xmath110 have been obtained from  @xcite , and we have assumed @xmath111 for the most central bin to be 2.5 fm .",
    "figure  [ fig : psi_inc ] depicts the fractional increase in @xmath2 yield as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we see that this increases with @xmath3 .",
    "apart from the transition of @xmath9 to @xmath2 , there would be multiple factors contributing to the @xmath2 yield .",
    "these include cnm effects , suppression effects due to debye color screening , etc .",
    "absorption due to cnm effects can be expected to be negligible at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the other cnm effects , namely cronin effect and shadowing , being initial state effects , would be expected to be the same between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "hence , we take the yield of @xmath1 as a measure of cnm . for ease of reference ,",
    "the @xmath1 yield in the p@xmath0pb collision is also plotted in figs .",

    "[ fig : psi_yield ] , we compare the @xmath2 yield with the experimental data .",
    "the @xmath2 yield includes the @xmath9 yield as a measure of cnm .",
    "the regions in the plot , where the experimental yield of @xmath2 is close to one , is a probable indication of suppression effects .    to include suppression , we model the mechanism of suppression due to debye color screening .",
    "we follow the formulation outlined in  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_yield_cs ] , the final @xmath2 yield after including the suppression due to color screening is depicted .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of color screening depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_yield_cs ] , is after taking into account the effect of the radial medium velocity , @xmath112 .",
    "relative to the medium , the effective momentum of @xmath2 , would be lorentz transformed according to @xmath113 .",
    "this lorentz transformed relative momentum is used for calculation of suppression due to debye color screening .",
    "the medium velocity is taken as @xmath114 based on  @xcite . the @xmath2 yield incorporating @xmath9 to @xmath2 transition",
    "is depicted using red curve .",
    "the net yield of the same after additionally including the suppression due to color screening is shown by the green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi_yield_cs ] .",
    "it can be seen here that , with suppression included , the experimental data is better captured .",
    "the results show that the @xmath2 suppression is relatively high at low @xmath3 , while gluo - excitation of @xmath9 to @xmath2 is high at high @xmath3 .",
    "a note on the effect of @xmath1 suppression is due at this point .",
    "we expect the temperature of the qgp , if it is formed , to be not very high .",
    "the @xmath1 dissociation temperature is about @xmath103 mev , which would almost always be above the qgp temperature formed in p@xmath0pb collisions .",
    "thus , @xmath1 will not undergo any suppression .",
    "simulation data ( not shown in this paper ) , indicate the same .    at this point",
    ", it is worthwhile to discuss about what happens to a @xmath3 integrated @xmath2 yield .",
    "since most of the @xmath2 production would be expected to be in the low @xmath3 region , the net @xmath2 yield would be dominated by what occurs in the low @xmath3 region , which is suppression . in peripheral p@xmath0pb collisions , where both suppression and gluon induced enhancement is expected to be low , there would be no enhancement or suppression w.r.t .",
    "it is not even clear , whether qgp is formed in peripheral p@xmath0pb collisions .",
    "another question that arises is whether such a phenomenon would be seen in pb@xmath0pb collision . in a pb@xmath0pb collision ,",
    "the temperatures of the medium are much higher , and can go upto @xmath115 or @xmath116 mev . at temperatures above @xmath13 mev , @xmath2 can not exist .",
    "any @xmath2 present would only dissociate .",
    "the gluon induced enhancement to @xmath2 can not happen during this period of the qgp . during the short time , when the temperature of the qgp reduces to below @xmath13 mev , this phenomenon may happen , but may get overshadowed by the suppression phenomenon that has been happening throughout the lifetime of the qgp . however , in extreme peripheral collisions , where the temperatures are much lower during the qgp lifetime , there could be a possibility of gluon induced @xmath2 enhancement at high @xmath3 .",
    "the authors are currently unaware of @xmath3 dependent lhc data , for pb@xmath0pb collisions , in the extreme peripheral region .",
    "in conclusion , we have attempted to explain the transverse momentum dependence of @xmath1 suppression data observed in @xmath117 collision at the lhc energy , over a wide span of transverse momentum .",
    "we have found a differential enhancement of @xmath2 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath9 at higher transverse momentum using gluon induced @xmath34 to @xmath29 transition approach , which qualitatively agrees with the preliminary atlas experimental data .",
    "we have also included the effect of suppression via the color screening mechanism . the combined result seems to corroborate better with experimental atlas data .",
    "we expect that the enhancement of @xmath9 to @xmath2 , as an increasing function of @xmath3 , if confirmed experimentally , can be a more definitive evidence for the presence of qgp in p@xmath0pb collision .",
