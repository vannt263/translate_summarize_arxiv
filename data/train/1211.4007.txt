    "the spectrum of @xmath29 for each @xmath30 is simple and the maximal spectral types of @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 , for @xmath30 are mutually singular : @xmath33 for @xmath25 .",
    "it is a folklore result that the simplicity of spectra of all @xmath31 yields automatically the scs property for @xmath1 ( for a proof see  @xcite ) .",
    "one way to check that @xmath31 has simple spectrum is to show that @xmath34 the scs property was shown to be generic for flows  @xcite . while there is a variety of concrete examples of automorphisms enjoying the scs property , including the chacon automorphism @xcite and some mixing automorphisms @xcite , @xcite , much less is known in the case of flows .    in a recent paper  @xcite it was shown that some classes of smooth or regular flows on @xmath35 enjoy the scs property .",
    "the examples are given in terms of special flows @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is an irrational rotation @xmath38 and @xmath39 an integrable function ( for a formal definition of special flow see section  [ se : potokispecjalne ] ) :    * for a fixed @xmath40 different from any trigonometric polynomial for a `` generic '' @xmath41 the resulting flow @xmath42 has the scs property , * for @xmath43 piecewise absolutely continuous , with the sum of jumps different from zero , and @xmath44 with unbounded partial quotients the flow @xmath42 also has the scs property .",
    "recall that the flows described in the case ( a ) are smooth reparametrizations of linear flows on the torus @xmath45 .",
    "the class ( b ) was introduced by von neumann in  @xcite where it was shown there that these flows are weakly mixing .",

    "an additional feature of ( a ) and ( b ) is that the measure @xmath48 has always bounded support .",
