    "the presence of bipolar outflows in the vicinity of young stellar objects ( ysos ) is a generic feature of early stellar evolution .",
    "the outflows consist mostly of cold molecular gas , ionized material , and dust grains ejected with velocity in the range 100 - 300 km / s .",
    "a second characteristic of the circumstellar environment is a keplerian accretion disk surrounding the protostar ; the existence of these optically thick disks has been suggested by various observations , such as the high degree of linear polarization shown to be the result of multiple scattering by material in the disk ( bastien & mnard 1990 ) , and the absence of a red - shifted component in forbidden - line emission ( appenzeller et al .",
    "1984 ; edwards et al . 1987 ) .",
    "the observation that the thrust of the outflowing material can not be radiatively driven ( bally & lada 1983 ; cabrit 1989 ) suggests that the flows are hydromagnetic in nature .",
    "moreover , experimental evidence of correlations between the physical properties of the disk and those of the ejected material hint that the accretion disk is a necessary ingredient in the driving mechanism .",
    "for example , continuum observations have indicated that ysos with outflows of larger spatial extent correspond to stronger millimeter fluxes , which in turn can be related to the presence of a more massive disk ( cabrit & andr 1991 ; bontemps et al .",
    "furthermore , there are correlations between the forbidden - line emission profiles which are generated in the outflows , and near - infrared excess believed to be related to the accretion flow evolution ( gomez de castro & pudritz 1992 ; edwards et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "current models for the origin of the outflows involve magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) winds driven by the accretion disk , and can be divided into two categories .",
    "the first class of models postulates that the winds are driven by a magnetic field threading through the disk ( pelletier & pudritz 1992 ; ferreira & pelletier 1993a , b , 1995 ) : particles rotating in the vicinity of the disk are subjected to a centrifugal force whose component perpendicular to the magnetic field lines may be neglected ( assuming the magnetic field to be sufficiently strong ) ; this results in a ( centrifugal ) acceleration along the field lines , thus generating the outflows .",
    "a second popular interpretation is the so - called x - celerator model ( shu et al .",
    "1988 , 1994a , b ) ; in the region of the stellar equatorial plane where the radial acceleration is approximately null ( due to counterbalance of the gravitational and centrifugal forces ) , the strong magnetic field of the yso takes over the accretion mechanism , thus generating outflows . for the sake of briefness",
    ", we shall refer to these two categories of models as the pp and shu models , respectively .",
    "it is clear that further experimental data and analysis methods are needed to clarify the situation . in this spirit",
    ", we believe that a study of the scaling properties of the outflows could provide complementary information on the dynamics involved . the search for scaling in the outflows is motivated by the observation that over all scales , the equations of mhd for a non - dissipative medium present no characteristic length ( e.g. , carbone 1993 ) ;",
    "in addition , since the law of gravity is a scale invariant ( power law ) form , the gravitational field of the disk - protostar system will not introduce a characteristic scale , and hence _ a priori _ it is possible to obtain scale invariance over all scales ranging from the macroscopic size of the lobes down to the much smaller dissipation scale ( i.e. , the inner scale of the inertial range ) .",
    "a fundamental observation in the analysis of three - dimensional mhd turbulence is the existence of three physical quantities , namely the total energy ( i.e. the sum of the magnetic and the kinetic energies ) , the cross - helicity , and the magnetic helicity   and @xmath4 , respectively , where @xmath5 is the velocity field , @xmath6 is the magnetic field , and @xmath7 is the vector potential . ] , which are conserved by the non - linear terms in the ideal equations ( i.e. , without forcing terms , nor dissipation ) . considering the disk - protostar system as injecting the corresponding fluxes at large scales , they subsequently propagate ( or cascade ) towards smaller scales until the scale where dissipation becomes important is reached .",
    "furthermore , such propagation mechanisms are more efficient between scales of similar magnitude ( usual mhd turbulence is correspondingly `` local '' in fourier space ; e.g. , biskamp 1993 ; carbone et al .",
    "1996 ) , and over the inertial range , the ( statistical ) laws governing the propagation of flux are scale invariant .",
    "the combination of conserved fluxes and local interactions ( in scale ) is the basis for phenomenological cascade models of turbulence . in the case of ysos , since mhd turbulence implies the existence of three conserved fluxes in the inertial range , the dynamics of the outflows can approximatively be described by three non - linearly coupled cascade processes ( see schertzer & lovejoy 1995 ; schertzer et al .",
    "1997b ) , and , in the approximation that dust grains constitute a passive scalar quantity ( i.e. , they are advected by the velocity field without disturbing it ) , there will be an additional coupled cascade corresponding to the conserved flux of passive scalar variance ( obukhov 1949 ; corrsin 1951 ) .    while the idea of cascades in hydrodynamic turbulence was introduced by richardson ( 1922 ) , the first explicit cascade models were not developed until the 1960 s ( novikov & stewart 1964 ; yaglom 1966 ; mandelbrot 1974 ) , and have become since then the basic tools for studying turbulent intermittency .",
    "developments in the following two decades led to the current understanding that cascade models generically produce multifractals ( schertzer & lovejoy 1985 , 1987b ) , hence establishing their relevance in analyzing and modeling scale invariant multifractal fields .",
    "indeed , multifractals have already been applied to various astrophysical problems such as the large - scale structure of the universe ( e.g. , wiedenmann et al .",
    "1990 ; coleman & pietronero 1992 ; borgani et al . 1993 ; martinez & coles 1994 ; garrido et al . 1996 ; sylos labini & montuori 1998 ; sylos labini et al .",
    "1998 ; lovejoy , garrido & schertzer 1999 ) , ly@xmath0 clouds ( carbone & savaglio 1996 ) , the cosmic microwave background radiation ( pompilio et al .",
    "1995 ) , photospheric magnetic fields ( cadavid et al .",
    "1994 ) , photometric data of ngc 4151 ( longo et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the solar wind ( carbone 1993 , politano & pouquet 1995 ) .",
    "a basic difficulty in multifractal analysis and modeling is that at a purely general level , multifractals implicitly involve an infinite number of parameters ( e.g. , the codimension function ) , and hence would be unmanageable if no further simplification could be made .",
    "fortunately , there exist multifractal universality classes , which are stable attractors of multiplicative cascades ( schertzer & lovejoy 1987b , 1989a , b , 1991 , 1997a ) .",
    "universality is of practical importance , since it reduces the number of parameters required for the description of the scaling function of multifractal fields to only three .",
    "although the cascades and corresponding multifractals usually discussed in the literature involve isotropic scaling , physical systems generally exhibit preferred spatial directions ( for example , almost all scaling geophysical systems are strongly stratified due to gravity ) . the need to handle scaling freed from the constraints of isotropy led to the development of the formalism of generalized scale invariance ( hereafter gsi , schertzer & lovejoy 1985 , 1987a , b , 1989a , b , 1991 ; lovejoy & schertzer 1985 ) which is the most general framework for describing anisotropic scaling . in the case of bipolar nebulae , the application of gsi to the study of their scaling properties is motivated by the observation that the outflowing material is not isotropically ejected from the disk - protostar system , and the anticipation that the direction and strength of the anisotropy may vary with scale .    in this paper , we present a multifractal analysis of near - infrared light scattered from dust grains in bipolar outflows , using images of v380 orionis , v645 cygni ( gl 2789 ) , lkh@xmath0 101/ngc 1579 , lkh@xmath0 233 , pv cephei ( for a discussion of their physical parameters , see bastien & mnard 1990 ) , v633 cassiopeiae ( e.g. , asselin et al .",

    "an immediate issue in interpreting scattered light field is the relationship of radiative transfer to the density field of the lobes ; indeed , this basic remote sensing problem of radiative transfer through multifractal clouds constitutes an important application of multifractals ( e.g. , lovejoy et al .",
    "1995 ; lovejoy & schertzer 1995 ) . since the radiative transfer equation has no characteristic scale , if the spatial distribution of scatterers is scale invariant so will the related radiation field .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to infer that if the scattered light field displays scale invariance over a wide range of scales , then the underlying matter distribution will also possess scale invariant statistics .",
    "we shall come back to previous attempts of quantifying the correlations between the respective multifractal parameters of the scattered light and matter fields .",

    "the image of ggd 18 was the only one in the ensemble with sufficient intensity and spatial resolutions to allow a gsi analysis ( see section  [ sig ] ) , and it is thus worthwhile to describe some of its known features .",
    "this object is located at 30.25  nw of the binary gl 961 ( cohen 1973 ) , and was first identified as a possible candidate for a hh object ( gyulbudaghian et al .",
    "a few years later , lenzen et al .",
    "( 1984 ) discovered an ir source embedded in the nebulous region of ggd 18 ( it corresponds to the maximum of intensity of figure  [ fig : ggd18_image ] , identified by a small cross ) , but did not speculate on its nature .",
    "polarization maps from deconvoluted images revealed ( gravel 1990 ) a centrosymmetric pattern centered on the ggd 18 source showing that it was a yso , along with a region of aligned vectors near the source indicating the presence of an optically thick disk ( the annular structure near the source and along the ne and sw directions is believed to correspond to a fraction of the disk that is visible ) ; the inclination of the latter with respect to the line of sight was estimated at @xmath10 ( the northern lobe points toward the observer ) , and the symmetry axis of the nebula points at @xmath10 nw ( gravel 1990 ) .",
    "finally , spiral - like polarization patterns were discovered in the vicinity of the source , indicating a complex distribution of matter that may be the result of rotation in the material near the source , combined with the effects of possible local inhomogeneities in the disk .",
    "an unresolved issue is the extent at which the dynamics of the outflows are influenced by the proximity of the binary gl 961 ; evidence that the co bipolar jet of gl 961 reaches and influences the outflow dynamics of ggd 18 was provided by gravel ( 1990 ) , but a quantitative study of such interactions is still needed . to summarize his argument",
    ", we notice that both lobes are more extended in the western direction , and the apparent contraction on the eastern side is believed to result from interactions with the jet ; the latter appears as a faint island ( approximately 12  in length ) located in ( 1,1 ) , and points in the nw direction .",
    "it is more visible in ( 1,2 ) and enters both ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,3 ) , where it turns around towards the sw direction ; such deviations could be the result of interactions with nebulous structures to the north of ggd 18 .",
    "the local maximum in section ( 0,0 ) corresponds to the western component of the binary gl 961 ; since gl 961 is an intense source of unscattered light , the region ( 0,0 ) will be excluded to allow an unbiased analysis of scattered light in the outflows . for similar reasons , section ( 2,0 ) will also be excluded from the analysis .",
    "it is well known that the navier - stokes ( ns ) equations are invariant under the rescaling @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . assuming that @xmath14 , the energy flux to smaller scales , is a scale invariant quantity",
    ", it is found that @xmath15 , and dimensional analysis leads to the famous scaling law @xmath16 for the energy density in momentum space ( komolgorov 1941 ; hereafter k41 ) . while the equations of mhd satisfy similar scaling relations , there is no consensus on what the analogue of k41 should be ( the corresponding dimensional analysis no longer gives a unique dimensional combination , hence unique exponent ) . in terms of elsasser variables ,",
    "eddies fall into two classes depending on their direction of propagation along the magnetic field lines : interactions between eddies belonging to different classes are less likely , thus weakening the energy transfer ( iroshnikov 1963 ; kraichman 1965 ; hereafter ik ) .",
    "consequently , the characteristic interaction time @xmath17 ( i.e. the eddy turnover time ) is increased to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the characteristic time for alfvn waves , and @xmath20 is some positive constant ( politano & pouquet 1995 ) . the scaling relation becomes : @xmath21 with @xmath22 corresponding to the ik theory .",
    "it is found experimentally that in hydrodynamical media k41 is generally not respected for individual realizations  even in estimates of the ensemble average , the exponent differs from 5/3 ; the discrepancy can be attributed to intermittency ( fluctuations in @xmath14 due to small - scale non - linear structures ) . as discussed in the introduction , multiplicative cascades model the propagation of conserved fluxes in turbulent intermittent media , and in general present the expected characteristics of a fully developped turbulent field .",
    "the general outcome of such cascades is a multifractal field which is scale invariant over the inertial range , and whose flux density at resolution @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath24 , is described by ( schertzer & lovejoy 1987b ) :    @xmath25    where the brackets indicate an average over many realizations , and @xmath26 is the moment scaling function .",
    "the arbitrariness of @xmath27 in the rescaling of the ns or mhd equations allows the possibility of scaling of different moments of the intensity spectrum , and this feature is what equation  [ eq : kq ] describes .",
    "while in general @xmath26 need only be convex , cascades possess stable , attractive _",
    "universality classes _ ( schertzer & lovejoy 1987b , 1997 ) whose description requires only three parameters , namely @xmath0 , @xmath28 and @xmath27 , with the corresponding moment scaling function determined by the universality relation : @xmath29 the significance of each of the three universality parameters on the multifractal field can be described as follows :    * @xmath28 corresponds to the codimension of the mean field , and thus distinguishes between a field whose mean is dominated by a few localized intense peaks ( large @xmath28 ) , and one with a mean dominated by a larger proportion of its surface ( small @xmath28  for non - fractal such as white noise , @xmath30 ) ; * @xmath27 is a measure of the degree of ( scale by scale ) non - conservation of the field , or qualitatively a measure of its smoothness ( with large values of @xmath27 corresponding to smoother fields , see eqs .",
    "[ eq : iso_scaling ] and  [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "for example , in usual hydrodynamic turbulence the energy flux to smaller scales is conserved ( @xmath27=0 ) whereas the velocity shears have the komolgorov value @xmath15 ; * @xmath0 is the degree of multifractality , i.e. , a measure of the deviation from the monofractal case . as @xmath0 is the lvy index of the multifractal generator , we have the restriction @xmath31 , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 corresponding to monofractal ( @xmath34 model ) and log - normal models , respectively  .",
    "a preliminary verification of the existence of scale invariance is that the spectral energy density satisfies a general ( isotropic ) scaling law : @xmath35 where @xmath34 is the scaling exponent , or spectral slope .",
    "after the existence of a scaling regime is established , one can proceed to compute the scaling function @xmath26 and test for universal multifractal behavior .",
    "an efficient technique for that purpose is the double trace moment ( dtm ) method ( lavalle 1991 ; lavalle et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ) . a new function @xmath36",
    "is first defined similarly to @xmath26 in equation  [ eq : kq ] , but for a field @xmath37 at its maximal resolution @xmath38 , raised to the @xmath39 power ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) , and renormalized by spatial averaging .",
    "hence , writing @xmath41 to indicate the @xmath23-resolution @xmath42 moment of @xmath43 , we obtain the following generalization of equation  [ eq : kq ] :    @xmath44    while it can be shown ( lavalle 1991 ) that @xmath36 and @xmath26 are related by @xmath45 the advantage of the dtm technique for testing and characterizing universality compared with other methods ( e.g. , schmitt et al .",
    "1995 ) is realized when @xmath26 is universal ( eq .  [ eq : mf_universality ] ) , in which case the @xmath39-dependence factorizes : @xmath46    the dtm method allows the computation of @xmath36 , and assuming universality , the lvy index @xmath0 can be deduced from equation  [ eq : kqeta ] .",
    "the remaining parameters @xmath28 and @xmath27 are also determined from a knowledge of @xmath36 .",
    "explicitly , one finds :    @xmath47    and    @xmath48    we conclude this section with a few comments concerning the range of validity of the above equations when analyzing images of physical fields . in practice",
    ", the finite size of the sample implies that sufficiently high order moments are dominated by the largest value assumed by the field , and therefore underestimate the true ensemble moments . beyond some threshold @xmath49 , which for a single realization is given by @xmath50 equation  [ eq : mf_universality ]",
    "is no longer expected to hold true , and @xmath26 becomes linear .",
    "here , @xmath51 is the dimension of the space over which the analysis is made ( @xmath52 for the images discussed here ) .",
    "one therefore encounters a `` multifractal phase transition '' ( schertzer et al .",
    "as discussed in section  [ dtmtheory ] , scale invariance is a necessary condition for a physical field to be multifractal , and its existence should be verified before computing the universal parameters .",
    "a first analysis is to consider the isotropic power spectrum since the spectral energy density @xmath53 of an isotropic mhd turbulent medium is expected to obey a scaling law with exponent @xmath34 ( see eq .",

    ", we note a break in scaling occurring at small scales ( i.e. , large wavenumber ) , followed by a regime of constant or increasing energy density .",
    "we shall argue that the scale at which scaling breaks corresponds to the resolution at which structures of the intensity field become dominated by noise .",
    "this is easily seen in the case of ggd 18 , where the break occurs at a resolution of approximately 0.3  , while the seeing at the time of data acquisition was estimated at 0.4  . on the other hand , the high frequency behavior of @xmath53 for the spectrum of lkh@xmath0 101 is linear ( @xmath54 ) in wavenumber , as expected for gaussian white noise in 2d space   101 , the fact that the break is not a manifestation of the seeing results from the limited exposures compared to those of ggd 18 . ] .",

    "it follows from the definition of @xmath98 that these operators form a one - parameter multiplicative group , with corresponding generator @xmath100 given by :    @xmath101    while equation  [ eq : tlambda ] allows @xmath100 to be non - linear ( schertzer & lovejoy 1985 ) , in order to simplify the computations we shall make a linear approximation by assuming that @xmath100 and @xmath98 are real matrices with constant coefficients , which is equivalent to assuming that the anisotropy of the scales is translationally invariant within the image analyzed . since gsi analyses are conventionally performed in fourier space ,",
    "the operator of interest is the fourier analogue of @xmath100 , which shall also be denoted @xmath100 by an abuse of notation ( in the case of linear gsi , these matrices are transpose of each other ) . expanding the matrix generator in terms of pseudo - quaternions , we write :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 denotes the unit matrix , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are the @xmath107 generators in the pauli representation , and @xmath108 are real (",
    "note that since the coefficient of the identity matrix would correspond to an isotropic magnification , it has been set equal to unity without loss of generality ) .",
    "this choice of basis is particularly convenient for gsi analysis as it decouples rotation and stratification .",
    "it follows from equations  [ eq : tlambda ] and  [ eq : gexpansion ] that , within the approximation of linear gsi , scale transformations are completely determined by the specification of @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "it is instructive at this point to discuss a few examples of @xmath100 , and corresponding family of balls obtained by repeated applications of @xmath98 on the unit ball . for the purpose of this discussion , we assume that @xmath100 is a 2x2 matrix , corresponding to the analysis of two - dimensional data with translationally invariant statistics .",
    "the simplest example is the case where @xmath100 is the identity matrix , corresponding to @xmath112 , or self - similar scaling .",
    "in addition , if the unit ball is chosen to be the unit circle , the family of balls generated by @xmath98 are circles as well .",
    "more generally , the scaling may be different in two or more preferred directions .",
    "for simplicity , suppose there are two such directions assumed to coincide with the x and y axes , in which case the scaling is said to be self - affine : the off - diagonal elements of @xmath100 remain null , but the diagonal entries may be different from unity .",
    "if the unit ball is taken to be the unit circle , the corresponding balls are ellipses with principal axes pointing in the x and y directions .",
    "furthermore , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : balls]a ) , one finds that the balls are horizontally elongated for large wavenumbers ( @xmath113 ) and vertically elongated for small ones ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "an example of physical systems presenting approximately such scaling are vertical cross - sections of the atmosphere where self - affinity is caused by the ( stratifying ) gravitational field of the earth ( pflug et al . 1991 , 1993 ) .",
    "finally , a matrix generator with non - zero off - diagonal elements indicates differential rotation in the scaling ( see figure  [ fig : balls]b ) ) ; in the atmosphere for instance , the observed differential rotation can be generated by the coriolis force .",
    "the numerical calculation of the anisotropy parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 is performed using the scale invariant generator ( henceforth , sig ) technique ( lewis et al . 1999 ) .",
    "let us first define @xmath115 to be the modulus squared of the fourier transform of the field at wave vector @xmath116 .",
    "it follows from this definition that an angular integration of @xmath115 yields @xmath53 , as defined in section  [ dtmtheory ] . as a generalization of equation  [ eq : iso_scaling ]",
    ", we have the scaling relation :    @xmath117    where the norm is with respect to @xmath100 , the brackets indicate an average over all realizations , and @xmath118 is a generalized scaling exponent given in ( isotropic ) 2-d by @xmath119 .",
    "it follows that @xmath115 is in fact a function of @xmath100 , @xmath95 , @xmath118 , and @xmath116 , that is , @xmath120 . if the analyzed sample consists of @xmath121 data points denoted by @xmath122 , @xmath123 , we can define an error function @xmath124 by :    @xmath125 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : sig}\\ ] ]    where the sum is over the data points ( @xmath126 ) and scale ratio ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the anisotropic parameters are then estimated by minimizing this error function .",
    "the evaluation of the anisotropy exponents with the sig technique requires data over a wide range of scales ( sufficient resolution ) , and good signal - to - noise ratio , such that the ( approximate ) isotropic scaling is valid over many scales . as mentioned in section  [ data ] , the images obtained at the omm did not show sufficiently good statistics for the type of analysis described in this section .",
    "figure  [ fig : gsiofggd18 ] displays the results of the sig analysis performed on the sub - images of ggd 18 ( defined in fig .  [",
    "fig : ggd18_image ] ) , where the quoted uncertainties on the parameters @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 were estimated from the numerical optimization of the error function @xmath124 defined in equation  [ eq : sig ] .",
    "since the error surface near its minimum was typically wider in the @xmath110 direction , this exponent is known with less accuracy than the other two .",
    "note that boxes ( 2,0 ) and ( 0,0 ) were left empty in figure  [ fig : gsiofggd18 ] as they contain the source of ggd 18 and the western component of the binary gl 961 .",
    "an immediate observation is the substantial variations of the parameters from one sub - region to the next ; while the choice of linear gsi simplifies the numerical calculations , the fact that the generator @xmath100 is not constant over the region analyzed suggests that the framework of non - linear gsi may be more appropriate in this case .",
    "we shall nevertheless assume that linear gsi is a good approximation over each subimage .",
    "the parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 which determine the off - diagonal elements of @xmath100 ( eq .  [ eq : gexpansion ] ) , are non - zero for most sub - regions , hence providing evidence for the existence of differential rotation in the outflow dynamics .",
    "they are comparatively larger in sections ( 1,0 ) , ( 2,1 ) and ( 3,1 ) , which cover the portions of the southern and northern lobes that are the closest to the protostar  disk system . as discussed in section  [ data ] , boxes ( 1,2 ) and ( 2,3 ) contain parts of a jet of matter presumably emitted by gl 961 at some point in the past .",
    "the large values of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath100 in these regions suggest that there is some rotation induced in the interaction region of this jet with ggd 18 material . however , it is not clear at this moment where the rotation exactly occurs ( e.g. in the jet , the perturbed material , or both ) since the linear sig technique does nt resolve variations of the exponents within subimages .",
    "it has been noted by gravel ( 1990 ) that the eastern edge of the northern lobe of ggd 18 appears to be pushed westward presumably by the jet of material of gl 961 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the region ( 1,1 ) where the jet and the northern lobe presumably comes the closest , is the only one with a positive value of @xmath110 .",
    "let us divide the image into two subregions ( see figure  [ fig : gsiofggd18 ] ) with region i covering what is morphologically identifiable as the lobes of the nebula , and region ii covering the rest of the observed field ( with the exception of the emission features ) .",
    "the assignation of subimages to either region was performed using the following criteria : subregions belonging to region i ( i ) were close to the @xmath10 symmetry axis of the nebula , ( ii ) the corresponding light intensity was more important , and ( iii ) their intensity contours had conical shapes ( indicative of ejection ) . with this classification , there appears to be a systematic difference in the mean value of @xmath109 between regions i and ii : quantitatively , the difference in mean values , @xmath128 is found to lie 4.0 standard deviations away from the case @xmath129 .",
    "although a precise identification of the stratifying factors is beyond the scope of our phenomenological framework , the observed stratification appears primarily dynamical in nature since @xmath109 is not observed to decrease monotonically with distance from the protostar ( as would be expected for gravitationally generated stratification ) , and since values of @xmath109 present clear differences within and outside the lobes of the nebula .",
    "the statistics of scattered light in a small ensemble of ysos have been shown to obey different scaling relations depending on the moment @xmath56 ( `` multiscaling '' ) , with the relation between scaling laws and statistical moments given by @xmath26 .",
    "it was also shown that these @xmath26 functions fit reasonably well into a multifractal universality class , and that the corresponding universal parameters are fairly uniform over the ensemble ( with @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 ) .",
    "although universality may be thought of as describing the attractors of multiplicative cascades , and consequently is not sufficiently sensitive on the initial conditions of the cascade to allow the observation and characterization of fine details in the dynamics of a given multifractal field , the reasonable uniformity of the results presented suggests that the seven objects in the ensemble have similar ( presumably turbulent ) dynamics , as expected on theoretical grounds",
    ".    finally , although obvious differences ( e.g. the existence of a magnetic field ) exist between the dynamics of the radiative fields of ysos and that of terrestrial water clouds , our results suggest that the corresponding statistics are similar . indeed , the spectral slope and the universality parameters of atmospheric clouds ( @xmath133 and @xmath134  sachs et al .",
    "1999 ) are close to that of bipolar nebulae ( see table  [ tab : results.all ] ) .",
    "since empirically cloud liquid water behaves statistically approximately like a passive scalar ( lovejoy & schertzer 1995 ) , its statistical similarity with ysos would make sense if dust grains in bipolar outflows constituted a passive scalar as well .",
    "furthermore , the physics of radiative transfer is also similar since in each case it is dominated by scattering rather than absorption / emission processes .",
    "all the objects in the ensemble presented reasonable isotropic scaling , that was systematically broken near the scale where noise becomes dominant in the measured signal . only ggd 18 presented sufficient resolution to allow a gsi analysis of its statistics .",
    "most of the sub - regions analyzed had matrix generators with non - zero off - diagonal elements , revealing the existence of differential rotation .",
    "the origin of the latter and its influence on mass ejection mechanisms should be accounted for in models of star formation ; an obvious source of rotation in ysos is the rotation of the disk - protostar system , and some of the properties of the coupling of this rotation to the ejected material might be studied by techniques similar to those used in this work .",
    "all sub - images presented a non - zero value of @xmath109 , indicating a possible stratifying force in the outflow mechanism .",
    "it was argued in section  [ sig ] that such stratification would not be primarily gravitational in nature , but instead could result from dynamical pressure gradients related to physical forces , such as the centrifugal acceleration in the pp models , or the magnetic force in the shu models .",
    "finally , an important issue in the dynamics of ggd 18 is its interactions , if any , with the neighbouring yso gl 961 . showing that such interactions are indeed involved would confirm that ggd 18 is located at approximately the same distance from the earth as gl 961 , namely 1.6 kpc .",
    "we found that the generator of ( 1,1 ) was the only one to have off - diagonal elements of opposite sign ; as this box is believed to contain the region of closest approach between the northern lobe of ggd 18 and the jet from gl 961 , the peculiarity of its anisotropy parameters could be a sign of interactions between the two ysos .",
    "it should be kept in mind that linear gsi is probably not accurate enough to probe fine details in the dynamics , and is in fact increasingly understood as measuring local multifractal textures ( pecknold et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "while developments in non - linear gsi or models involving non - scalar cascades , along with an increased ensemble of sufficient resolution , are probably necessary to obtain statistically robust statements concerning the outflow dynamics , it is hoped that our analysis has provided a foretaste of the vast possibilities of multiscaling analyses .",
