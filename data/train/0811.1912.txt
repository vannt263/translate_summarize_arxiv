    "the standard time - dependent mean - field methods used in nuclear physics ( namely the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) approach and its derivatives @xcite ) have been successfully used to determine the expectation values for single - particle observables , such as fragment mass , in nuclear reactions and decays but severely underestimate the fluctuations in these values @xcite .",
    "this was first observed by davies et al .",
    "@xcite in 1978 who performed tdhf calculations to investigate the full - width - half - maximum of the mass of the projectile - like fragment for the heavy - ion reactions @xmath3kr+@xmath4pb ( @xmath5=@xmath6mev ) and @xmath3kr+@xmath7be ( @xmath5=@xmath8mev ) and found that they underestimated the experimental results by about an order of magnitude .",
    "it is now well known that the tdhf method underestimates the fluctuation of any single - particle operator , or in fact the expectation value of any many - body operator , except the energy @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the central assumption of the methods ; the approximation of the full many - body state of the system as a slater determinant , evolving in a mean - field , neglecting explicit two - body correlations .",
    "this problem was studied by balian and vnroni @xcite in the 1980 s , who produced a general variational theory optimised to the determination of the expectation values and fluctuations for arbitrary single - particle operators whilst the state of the system is given by a single slater determinant .",
    "they found that , for a system described , at the time @xmath9 , by the one - body density matrix , @xmath10 , the expectation value for the single - particle observable @xmath11 , at the later time @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 $ ] , in keeping with the usual tdhf approach , whilst the distribution , or standard deviation , @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 , \\label{eqn : bv}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a one - body density matrix related to @xmath17 through the boundary condition @xmath18 the time evolution of @xmath17 and @xmath16 is given by the usual tdhf equation .",
    "this latter result differs from the usual tdhf result @xmath19 , \\label{eqn : tdhf}\\ ] ] in that it depends explicitly on the initial time , @xmath9 , with the final time , @xmath12 , entering through the boundary condition ( [ eqn : sigma ] ) . the boundary condition ( [ eqn : sigma ] ) also contains the operator @xmath11 such that this approach is specifically tuned to the determination of @xmath14 .",
    "it has also been shown by dasso @xcite that , for simple operators such as mass ( or , equivalently , charge ) , the single - particle nature of tdhf leads to an unphysical upper limit on the mass distributions that can be obtained from ( [ eqn : tdhf ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total number of nucleons in the system .    solving ( [ eqn : bv ] )",
    "requires that a hartree - fock calculation be performed to determine the initial state , @xmath10 followed by a suitable instantaneous excitation of the system and a tdhf calculation from @xmath9 to @xmath12 to determine @xmath22 .",
    "the transformation ( [ eqn : sigma ] ) gives @xmath23 and a second tdhf calculation must then be performed , backwards from @xmath12 to @xmath9 , to obtain @xmath24 .",
    "these latter steps must be repeated for a range of values of @xmath25 to allow @xmath26 to be determined from the extrapolation of @xmath25 to @xmath27 .",
    "the large number of calculations required to evaluate ( [ eqn : bv ] ) , and their complexity , means that only a handful of calculations were performed using this method and those calculations used simplified interactions and symmetries ( either spherical @xcite , or axial @xcite ) to make the problems solvable .",
    "however , advances in computing power mean that this approach can now be implemented using fully three - dimensional tdhf codes with full skyrme interactions @xcite .    written in terms of the occupied single - particle states ( [ eqn : bv ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath21 is the number of nucleons in the system .",
    "the wavefunctions @xmath30 are the wavefunctions from the backwards tdhf calculations and are related to the wavefunctions from the forwards calculations , @xmath31 , through the boundary condition @xmath32 in these calculations , as in bonche and flocard s earlier work @xcite , the wavefunctions @xmath33 were obtained by evolving the tdhf equations forwards and then backwards without the transformation ( [ eqn : sp - psi ] ) being applied .",
    "this approach ensures that all the single - particle wavefunctions used in evaluating ( [ eqn : sp - bv ] ) result from the same number of computations and has been found to significantly reduce systematic numerical errors @xcite allowing the extrapolation required in ( [ eqn : sp - bv ] ) to be extended to significantly smaller values of @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the mass distribution in a bounded region of space around a nucleus and calculate the mass ( number of nucleons ) in the nucleus according to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the cut - off radius used to define the bounded region of space and @xmath36 is the centre - of - mass location of the nucleus .",
    "we consider first a giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) in the deformed nucleus @xmath0s decaying through particle emission .",
    "the calculations were all performed in a cubic spatial box of size @xmath39fm discretised in steps of @xmath40fm .",
    "the static hartree - fock calculation was carried out using the sly6 parametrisation @xcite of the skyrme interaction and produced a ground state with prolate deformation ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "a dipole excitation was induced by acting on each wavefunction at @xmath42 with a boost @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a spatial cut - off , and where , for protons , @xmath45 , and for neutrons , @xmath46 , where @xmath21 is the nucleus atomic mass and @xmath47 is its charge .",
    "the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 parameters determine the strength of the applied boost and were set to @xmath51@xmath52 .    in the present calculation ,",
    "the system was evolved forward in time until @xmath53 fm / c .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions were used at the edge of the spatial box , where the wavefunctions disappear . these lead to spurious reflections for sufficiently large @xmath12 so the value chosen for @xmath12 had to be kept sufficiently small , whilst ensuring that @xmath54 had stabilised following the prompt de - excitation of the resonance by particle emission .",
    "the dipole moments , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , as a function of time , are shown in figure [ fig : s32](a ) , in accordance with @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 denotes @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the expectation values for position calculated using the proton and neutron single - particle states respectively .",
    "the prolate deformation of the @xmath0s nucleus ( with @xmath62 the long - axis ) results in @xmath56 and @xmath57 being identical whilst @xmath55 differs .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 provides an estimate of the excitation energy for the oscillations along each of the three primary axes . for @xmath55 , a period of @xmath67fm / c",
    "is found , giving an excitation energy @xmath68mev and , for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , a period of @xmath69fm / c gives an excitation energy @xmath70mev .",
    "following the decay of the gdr in @xmath0s , it was found that @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( using @xmath73fm ) representing the emission of @xmath74 nucleons .",
    "@xmath35 was chosen so that the bounded region fully enclosed the nucleus but omitted , as much as possible , the radiated components of the wavefunctions .",
    "from ( [ eqn : max ] ) we obtain @xmath75 . following evolution to @xmath12 , the transformation ( [ eqn : sp - psi ] ) was applied and the system evolved back to @xmath9 for @xmath25 values down to @xmath76 .",
    "after each calculation the fluctuation , @xmath77 , was calculated using ( [ eqn : sp - bv ] ) and the results plotted and extrapolated back to @xmath78 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : s32](b ) , giving @xmath79 which represents a @xmath80% increase in @xmath81 and exceeds the tdhf upper limit , @xmath82 .",
    "calculations were also performed for @xmath83fm and @xmath84fm and showed only small changes in the results consistent with the bounded region enclosing increasing amounts of the wavefunctions tails .",
    "the calculations were repeated for the doubly magic nucleus @xmath1sn using the same spatial box and interaction as in the @xmath0s calculation .",
    "an initial dipole boost ( [ eqn : gdr - boost ] ) with @xmath85@xmath52 induced the resonance , which was evolved from @xmath86fm / c to @xmath53fm / c as before .",
    "the dipole moments show a periodicity of @xmath87fm / c corresponding to a resonance energy of @xmath88mev which is close to the experimental value of @xmath89mev @xcite .",
    "the standard thdf calculation gave , at the time @xmath12 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 representing the emission of @xmath92 nucleons . from ( [ eqn : max ] ) we obtain @xmath93 .",
    "again , the balian - vnroni transformation was applied for different values of @xmath25 , the extrapolation to @xmath78 yielding @xmath94 , representing a @xmath95% increase in @xmath81 compared with the standard tdhf result .",
    "the main application for this method will be heavy - ion collisions as mentioned in the introduction . as a test case using light nuclei , collisions between @xmath2o nuclei at @xmath98mev have been studied .",
    "the dynamic calculations were carried out in a rectangular space of size @xmath99fm except the head - on calculation where , taking advantage of the symmmetry a spatial box of size @xmath100fm was used .",
    "the nuclei were initially positioned at @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the impact parameter and the nuclei collide in the @xmath62-@xmath64 plane .",
    "calculations were performed for impact parameters @xmath102 = @xmath27 , @xmath40 , @xmath60 and @xmath103fm .",
    "contour plots showing the densities during a collision for @xmath104fm are shown in figure [ fig : o16 ] .",
    "the calculations were run for @xmath105timesteps ( @xmath106fm / c ) until the scattered nuclei had clearly separated but before they reached the edge of the box .",
    "the exception was the calculation for @xmath107fm where the nuclei fused with the compound nucleus decaying through particle emission and where the runtime was extended to @xmath105fm / c to allow the excited compound nucleus time to decay and check that it did not undergo a delayed fission .",
    ".mass distributions calculated for @xmath2o+@xmath2o at @xmath98mev using the standard tdhf approach and the balian - vnroni variational approach for a range of impact parameters ( the equivalent angular momentums are also given ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the mass distributions obtained from these calculations using the tdhf and bv approaches are given in table [ tab : o16 ] , showing the large increase ( at least doubling in each case ) of @xmath81 in the bv case over tdhf .",
    "the balian - vnroni approach has been implemented using a three - dimensional tdhf code with the full skyrme interaction and calculations have been performed for gdr s in @xmath0s and @xmath1sn and for collisions of @xmath2o nuclei .",
    "the bv approach produces mass distributions which are quantitatively larger than those obtained using the usual tdhf approach .",
    "we are continuing to apply this approach to heavy ion collisions with a view towards performing calculations for heavier systems to allow a comparison with experimental data .",
