    "it is known that the relativistic degeneracy is due to gigantic external pressure on stellar configuration caused by gravity .",
    "such a change in the degeneracy state of fermions from the normal to relativistic one can alter the whole thermodynamic properties of dense matter @xcite . as a consequence the quantum degeneracy pressure of the electrons is altered .",
    "this change in the pressure is usually described by the polytropic shape @xmath0 with @xmath1 for the extreme cases of non- and ultra - relativistic degeneracies @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that such representation of equation of state is far from general and one can not extent such equation of state to the zero - temperature fermi plasma of all density ranges . in a fermi - dirac plasma the degeneracy pressure is coupled with the electron density , @xmath2 , or equivalently to the electron fermi - momentum , @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , for a typical white - dwarf the density and electron degeneracy pressure increases as one move from outer layers towards the core .",
    "the exact form of chandrasekhar pressure can be written as @xcite @xmath4 } \\right\\}{\\rm { } } , \\ ] ] in which @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the relativity parameter with @xmath3 being the electron fermi relativistic momentum .",
    "it is noted that the pressure is intimately related to the electron number - density of plasma and if one needs to define a general polytropic form of @xmath0 for the pressure of degenerate electrons or positrons , one gets a parameter @xmath8 which is not independent of the equilibrium number - density of electrons .",
    "this fact has been ignored completely in ref .",
    "it is also easy using the generalized chandrasekhar relation eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) to confirm mathematically that @xmath9 as expected .",
    "figure 1 . shows the complicated dependence of the parameter , @xmath10 , on the electron equilibrium number - density .",
    "it is clearly observed that , the use of such polytropic form for general description of fermi - dirac plasmas is useless , unless , the complex relation of the parameter , @xmath10 , and the electron number - density has to be taken into account in formulation , which is obviously absent in ref .",
    "it is further remarked that in this model the value of @xmath10 , hence the pressure , diverges for the typical white - dwarf electron - density of @xmath11 , while , for the exact pressure one gets a finite value .",
    "thus , the generalized form of chandrasekhar eos should be used in order to evaluate the possibility of nonlinear excitations for the whole range of the relativity parameter ( electron number - density ) as in refs .",
