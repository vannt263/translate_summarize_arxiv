    "<S> the resulting equation of elastic equilibrium , @xmath47 is identical to the equation of motion of a free relativistic particle . with the lorentz boost in mind </S>",
    "<S> , we immediately identify the transformation of coordinates @xmath48 , which leaves eqn ( [ free - rel ] ) unchanged : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . </S>",

    "<S> [ lorentzrotation ] . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation leaves the line element on the material - coordinates plane unchanged , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this reparametrization invariance defines a continuous family of solutions to the equation of equilibrium , containing all the cylindrical , compressed configurations of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> these configurations satisfy local mechanical equilibrium but differ in their total energy . </S>",

    "<S> a flat elastic filament of length @xmath12 is described by the blue line . </S>",
    "<S> as viewed from the new frame , the total length is compressed by a factor @xmath39 , and the angle coordinate , @xmath56 , is linearly changing , resulting in a cylindrical compressed shape of radius @xmath57 and length @xmath58.,width=264 ]    an important physical distinction should be made , however , between the two sides of the analogy . </S>",
    "<S> in the elastic problem there is a unique zero - energy state , and one naturally specifies the length @xmath4 and the boundary conditions with respect to that relaxed state ; the compressed length @xmath12 is determined by minimization . by contrast , in relativity there is no preferred reference frame , and the duration of the experiment and the boundary conditions are given in the laboratory frame , not the proper one . </S>",
    "<S> this difference leads to the extra prefactor @xmath59 above . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to this prefactor the elastic strain can be either compressive or dilative , whereas the relativistic lorentz factor must be dilative . , the information on the unique reference state would be lost , and the two problems , the elastic and relativistic , would become identical . </S>",
    "<S> this can be readily shown by transforming eqn ( [ energye ] ) to @xmath9 and minimizing with respect to @xmath39 . ] </S>",
    "<S> note that , because of the minus sign in the mapping @xmath60 , time dilation corresponds to elastic compression .    </S>",
    "<S> despite the physical difference , by absorbing the factor @xmath59 in the potential , the two problems become mathematically equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a known solution in one system can be readily transferred to the other . </S>",
    "<S> we shall now use known results for the buckling of compressible elastica to write down an explicit solution to the equation of motion of a relativistic nonlinear pendulum . </S>",

    "<S> the reason for the unexpected success of the compressible - elastica model in these two examples is unclear at present . </S>",
    "<S> compressibility is essential in the case of two - dimensional deformations with non - zero gaussian curvature . </S>",

    "<S> we have shown above how the buckling of a compressible filament can be studied as the oscillation of a relativistic nonlinear pendulum . </S>",
    "<S> here are a few suggestions for future extensions . </S>",
    "<S> the instability of a flat compressible rod or sheet toward curved configurations is connected to the emergence of oscillations from rest in the parametric resonance of a relativistic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> a change in the compression modulus of an elastic system ( e.g. , as a result of a temperature change ) is likened to a change in a particle s rest mass . </S>",
