    "the main focus of this chapter is on the formation of massive black holes ( bhs ) through stellar - dynamical processes in young star clusters . here by `` massive '' we mean bhs with masses in the range @xmath0 , which could be `` intermediate mass '' bhs in small systems such as globular clusters ( van der marel , this volume ) or `` seed '' bhs in larger systems such as proto - galactic nuclei .",
    "the later growth of seed bhs by gas accretion or stellar captures to form supermassive bhs in galactic nuclei is discussed by blandford ( this volume ) .",
    "the early dynamical evolution of dense star clusters on a time scale @xmath1 is completely dominated by the most massive stars that were formed in the cluster .",
    "this early phase of the evolution is therefore very sensitive to the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , particularly at the high - mass end ( see clarke , this volume ) .",
    "one possibility , which we will discuss in some detail here , is that the massive stars could drive the cluster to core collapse before evolving and undergoing supernova explosions .",
    "successive collisions and mergers of these massive stars during core collapse can then lead to a runaway process and the rapid formation of a very massive object containing the entire mass of the collapsing cluster core .",
    "although the fate of such a massive merger remnant is rather uncertain , direct `` monolithic '' collapse to a bh with little or no mass loss is a likely outcome , at least for sufficiently low metallicities @xcite .    alternatively , if the most massive stars in the system evolve and produce supernovae before the onset of this runaway collision process , the collapse of the cluster core will be reversed by the sudden mass loss , and a cluster of stellar - mass bhs will be formed .",
    "the final fate of this cluster is also rather uncertain . for small systems such as globular clusters ,",
    "complete evaporation is likely ( with all the stellar - mass bhs ejected from the cluster through 3-body and 4-body interactions in the dense core ) .",
    "this is expected theoretically on the basis of simple qualitative arguments ( kulkarni , hut , & mcmillan 1993 ; sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ) and has been demonstrated recently by direct @xmath2-body simulations @xcite .",
    "however , for larger systems such as proto - galactic nuclei , contraction of the cluster to a highly relativistic state could again lead to successive mergers ( driven by gravitational radiation ) and the formation of a single massive bh @xcite .",
    "because of the great complexity and variety of dynamical processes involved , questions related to bh formation in dense star clusters are best studied using numerical simulations . on today s computers , this can be done with direct @xmath2-body simulations for @xmath3 stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or with monte carlo ( mc ) techniques ( see sec .",
    "1.2 ) for up to @xmath4 stars .",
    "observationally , this large range covers a variety of well - studied young star clusters , from `` young populous clusters '' ( e.g. , arches , r136 ) to `` super star clusters '' @xcite",
    ". however , realistic , star - by - star simulations of larger systems , on the scales of entire galactic nuclei , are not yet possible . for these systems",
    ", one must rely on more qualitative analyses based on extrapolations from numerical results for smaller @xmath2 .",
    "the role of stellar collisions in dense galactic nuclei was first consider to explain the quasar / active galactic nucleus phenomenon ( e.g. , spitzer & saslaw 1966 ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that , when collisions first set in a stellar cluster evolving from `` reasonable '' initial conditions , they are unlikely to be disruptive so that runaway mergers should lead to the formation of massive stars .",
    "he estimated that growth would saturate at @xmath5 because small stars could fly across a massive star without being stopped . in `` particle - in - a - box''-type simulations using a semi - analytical model for the outcome of individual collisions",
    ", @xcite found clear runaway growth up to a few hundred @xmath6 .",
    "no proper account of the stellar dynamics was included , however ; the cluster was treated as a homogeneous sphere of constant mass ( the gas ejected in collisions being recycled into stars ) contracting through collisional energy loss .",
    "stellar dynamics must be playing an important role , however , especially for massive stars , which can be affected significantly by mass segregation .",
    "indeed , massive stars of mass @xmath7 undergo mass segregation and concentrate into the cluster core on a time scale @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the average stellar mass and the overall relaxation time ( at the half - mass radius @xmath10 ) for a cluster of total mass @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 it is clear that the most massive stars in a dense cluster can undergo mass segregation on a time scale much shorter then their stellar evolution time . when they eventually dominate the density in the cluster core , these massive stars will then _ decouple dynamically _ from the rest of the cluster ( go out of thermal equilibrium , evolving _ away _ from energy equipartition ) and evolve very quickly to core collapse .",
    "this process is often referred to as spitzer s `` mass - segregation instability . ''",
    "the possibility of a `` mass - segregation instability '' in simple two - component systems ( clusters containing only two kinds of stars , one much more massive than the other ) was first predicted by @xcite , and the first dynamical simulations revealing mass segregation at work were performed in the 70 s @xcite .",
    "the physics of this instability is now very well understood theoretically ( watters , joshi , & rasio 2000 ) . in a remarkably prescient paper , @xcite showed correctly for the first time that this instability must affect the early dynamical evolution of any star cluster born with a reasonable `` salpeter - like '' imf .",
    "he concluded that , as a result , `` most globular clusters may undergo core collapse at an early time in the evolution of the universe .",
    "this is clearly significant as a possible mechanism for creating collapsed bodies in the center of globular clusters . ''",
    "published a paper in apj discussing all of the ramifications .",
    "we did not know how to form the beast  the work of colgate and spitzer showed how it would work if the star density was high enough , but the densities required were far greater than any that could reasonably exist in the centers of galaxies .",
    "but we were convinced that such phenomena must exist in the centers , and hoyle was quite angry when much later in 1969 lynden - bell was given credit for the idea after a press conference . by then",
    "hoyle and i had become convinced that the usual mechanism of accretion would not give enough energy because the efficiency of the process in terms of what _ we see _ must be very low , and much below 10% .",
    "thus we turned to new and fundamental ideas concerning creation in galaxy centers which can only take place in regions of very strong gravitational fields , i.e. , next to classical bhs .",
    "this is my position today .",
    "fred and i worked on it until his death . when vishniac s paper appeared in 1978 , fred and i discussed it and realized that mass segregation might allow a bh to form rapidly .",
    "but this was in the context of total masses of @xmath13  globular clusters  much less than is required for massive bhs in nuclei .",
    "still we talked about doing more work on it .",
    "it was not pursued , probably because we were neither in a position to do it ourselves ; i was just moving to kitt peak as director , and fred had left cambridge and was living up in cumberland .",
    "but we both thought it was an important step forward . '' ] in their classic paper the same year , @xcite also mentioned the combination of mass segregation and runaway merging as `` one of the quickest routes to the formation of a massive object in a dense stellar system . ''",
    "however , the first detailed dynamical simulations of dense star clusters including stellar collisions and mergers considered clusters where all stars are initially identical ( lee 1987 ; quinlan & shapiro 1990 , hereafter qs90 ) .",
    "these fokker - planck ( fp ) simulations also included the dynamical formation of binaries through 3-body interactions and their subsequent hardening ( and ejection ) as a central source of energy capable of reversing core collapse and turning off collisions in clusters with a relatively low number of stars .",
    "furthermore , in these simulations , collisions themselves can stop collapse when collisionally produced massive stars lose mass in a supernova explosion at the end of their life .",
    "the results of these early simulations suggested that runaway collisions would occur provided that @xmath14yr ( to beat stellar evolution ) and @xmath15 ( to avoid binary heating ) .",
    "qs90 stressed that , as a result of mass segregation , the rise in the central velocity during collapse is only moderate and collisions do not become disruptive .",
    "although not very realistic , these early studies made plausible the idea that successive collisions and mergers of main - sequence stars could lead to the formation of a @xmath16 object .    more recently , through direct @xmath2-body simulations of clusters containing 2000 to 65,000 stars , @xcite showed that , in such low-@xmath2 systems , dynamically formed binaries , far from preventing collisions ( by heating the cluster and reversing collapse ) , actually _ encourage _ them by increasing the effective cross section . in these small systems ,",
    "once the few massive stars have segregated to the center , one of them will repeatedly form a binary with another star and later collide with its companion when an interaction with a third star increases the binary s eccentricity .",
    "the growth of this star is ultimately stopped by stellar evolution , or by the dissolution of the cluster in the tidal field of the parent galaxy .",
    "given the small number of stars in these simulations , the maximum mass of the collision product is only @xmath17 when mass loss from stellar winds is negligible .",
    "the `` pistol star '' in the galactic center quintuplet cluster @xcite may provide an example of a directly observable runaway collision product of this type in a small , young star cluster .",
    "work in progress by the authors is now attempting for the first time to study numerically these processes for much larger star clusters , containing up to @xmath4 stars , and resolving in detail the core collapse and runaway collisions .",
    "section 1.2 provides a summary of the numerical methods that we are using , based on a mc technique for collisional stellar dynamics .",
    "section 1.3 presents a few of our initial results .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "our numerical simulations show that , in the absence of stellar evolution , the core collapse time in a dense star cluster is always given by @xmath18 for any `` reasonable '' imf ( i.e. , not too different from a salpeter imf ) and initial cluster structure ( basically , any initial density profile that is `` not too centrally concentrated '' ) .",
    "if we assume that core collapse corresponds to the onset of runaway collisions , then the condition for a runaway to occur can be written very simply @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the lifetime of the most massive stars , of mass @xmath21 . from current stellar evolution calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we know that @xmath22 i.e. , nearly _ constant _",
    "( this is simply because these massive stars are nearly eddington - limited is compared to the `` usual '' @xmath23 , one could conclude erroneously that massive stars never play a role in core collapse @xcite .",
    "however , the approximate @xmath24 scaling of the stellar lifetime applies only for @xmath25 . ] ) , and also nearly independent of metallicity and rotation ( within @xmath26 ) .",
    "therefore , under very general conditions , the simple criterion for a runaway process can be written @xmath27 this is in perfect agreement with the results of the direct @xmath2-body simulations by @xcite , although they can not resolve the core collapse in their simulations , and instead _ define _ core collapse to be the onset of collisions and the total number of stars must be sufficiently large , @xmath28 .",
    "otherwise there will simply not be enough ( or any ) massive stars to collide . ] .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result from our new simulations is that the central ( bh ) mass produced by this runaway process may well be determined largely by the spitzer instability : the total mass in massive stars going into core collapse will be the final bh mass , at least in the absence of significant mass loss from stellar evolution . remarkably , we find that this mass is always ( within the same `` reasonable '' assumptions about the imf and initial cluster structure as above ) around @xmath29 of the total cluster mass , as suggested by observations ( see kormendy , richstone , and van der marel , this volume ) .",
    "mass segregation and collisional runaways are driven by the most massive stars in a cluster , which , for a `` normal '' imf , represent a very small fraction of the stellar population .",
    "for instance , in a salpeter imf from 0.2 to 120@xmath6 , only a fraction @xmath30 of stars are more massive than 60@xmath6 .",
    "resolving these processes thus requires numerical simulations with very large numbers of particles ( at least @xmath31 ) . in the last few years",
    ", new mc codes have been developed that make possible simulations of stellar clusters with such high resolutions .",
    "the results reported here have been obtained with two independent mc codes that we call , for convenience , and , as they were devised to follow the evolution of globular clusters and galactic nuclei , respectively .",
    "both are based on the scheme first proposed by @xcite , and they rely on very similar principles that we summarize below . in sections  [ subsec :",
    "mcglob ] and [ subsec : mcnucl ] , a few important aspects specific to each code are described .",
    "the mc technique assumes that the cluster is spherically symmetric and can be modeled by a set of discrete particles .",
    "each particle in the simulation could represent an individual star ( as in ) , or an entire spherical shell of stars sharing the same orbital and stellar properties ( as in   and most earlier mc codes ) . in the latter case , the number of particles may be lower than the number of stars in the simulated cluster , but the number of stars per particle has to be the same for all particles . another important assumption in these codes",
    "is that the system is always in dynamical equilibrium , so that orbital time scales need not be resolved and the natural time step is a fraction of the relaxation ( or collision ) time . instead of being determined by integration of its orbit , the position @xmath32 of a particle ( star , or the radius @xmath32 of the shell ) is picked at random , with a probability density that reflects the time spent at @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radial velocity along the orbit .",
    "the relaxation is treated as a diffusive process in the usual fp approximation @xcite .",
    "the long - term effects on orbits of departures of the gravitational forces from a smooth quasi - stationary potential , @xmath35 , are assumed to be those of a large number of uncorrelated small - angle scatterings .",
    "if a particle of mass @xmath36 travels with relative velocity @xmath37 through a homogeneous field of particles of mass @xmath38 with number density @xmath39 during @xmath40 , in the center - of - mass reference frame , its trajectory will be deflected by an angle @xmath41 with @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the gravitational constant and @xmath44 is the familiar coulomb logarithm @xcite . in the mc codes , at each time step , a pair of neighboring particles are selected and their velocities are modified through an effective hyperbolic encounter with deflection angle @xmath45 . as any given particle will be selected many times , at various positions on its orbit , the mc scheme will actually integrate the effect of relaxation over the particle s orbit and over all possible field particles .",
    "proper averaging is ensured if the time steps are sufficiently short for the orbit to be significantly modified only after a large number of effective encounters .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath35 is approximated as the potential generated by all the particles .",
    "this potential is not completely smooth because the particles are razor - thin spherical shells whose radii change discontinuously . through test computations",
    ", it can be shown that the corresponding spurious relaxation is negligible if the number of particles is @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to methods based on the direct integration of the fp equation in phase space , the particle - based mc approach allows for the natural inclusion of many additional stellar and dynamical processes , such as stellar evolution , collisions and mergers , tidal disruptions , captures , large - angle scatterings , and strong interactions with binaries .",
    "the dynamical effects of binaries ( the dominant 3- and 4-body processes ) , which may be crucial in the evolution of globular clusters , have been included in several mc codes through the use of approximate analytic cross sections and simple recipes @xcite .",
    "codes are currently in development by giersz , rasio and collaborators that will treat binaries with much higher realism by explicitly integrating 3- or 4-body interactions on the fly , a `` brute - force '' approach required to tackle the full diversity of unequal - mass binary interactions .    among methods that can be used to follow the dynamical evolution of collisional stellar systems , only direct @xmath2-body integrations do not require assumptions on the geometry of the system or dynamical equilibrium and , being also particle based , rival the ability of mc codes to incorporate realistic physics . unfortunately , as they are based on explicit integration of the orbits of @xmath2 particles and require the computation of all 2-body forces , they are extremely computationally demanding , with a cpu time scaling like @xmath47 . in practice ,",
    "even with the use of special - purpose computers ( such as the current grape-6 ) and in spite of continuous progress in the development of @xmath2-body algorithms , the simulation of a cluster containing @xmath48 stars still requires months of computer time @xcite .",
    "in contrast , mc codes , with cpu times scaling like @xmath49 , routinely use up to a few million particles .",
    "such high numbers of particles imply that globular clusters can actually be modeled on a star - by - star basis @xcite .",
    "however , galactic nuclei typically contain @xmath50 stars , and , for such systems , one has to take advantage of the fact that each physical process is included in the simulation with its explicit @xmath51 scaling so that a single particle can represent many stars ( in ) .",
    "one of our mc codes , , based directly on the ideas of @xcite described in the previous section , was developed to study the dynamical evolution of globular clusters using a realistic number of stars @xcite .",
    "one important characteristic of this code is that each particle represents a single star ( or binary star ) in the cluster , which allows us to incorporate stellar evolution processes in a completely realistic manner .",
    "the code uses a single time step for the evolution of all the stars ( typically a small fraction of the core relaxation time ) , which allows for effective parallelization of the algorithm .",
    "typical simulations for @xmath48 stars over @xmath52yr can be performed in just a few hours of computing time .",
    "this code has been tested extensively using comparisons to previous fp and direct @xmath2-body results , and it has been used to study a variety of fundamental dynamical processes such as the spitzer instability @xcite and mass segregation @xcite in simple two - component clusters .",
    "it was also used to re - examine the question of globular cluster lifetimes in the tidal field of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "work is in progress to incorporate a full treatment of primordial binaries , including all dynamical interactions ( binary  binary and binary  single ) as well as binary stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "another major advantage of these star - by - star mc simulations ( e.g. , compared to direct fp schemes ) is that it is straightforward to include a realistic , continuous stellar - mass spectrum . with a broad imf ,",
    "this requires adjusting carefully the coulomb logarithm , which can be done by using the results of large @xmath2-body simulations for calibration @xcite .",
    "another difficulty introduced by a broad mass spectrum is the necessity of adjusting carefully the time step to treat correctly encounters between stars of very different masses .",
    "when pairs of stars are selected to undergo an effective hyperbolic encounter as described above , one has to make sure that the deflection angle remains small for _ both _ stars . in situations where the mass ratio of the pair can be extreme",
    ", one has to decrease the time step accordingly @xcite . in practice , for the simulations described here , we find that the time step has to be reduced by a factor of up to @xmath53 compared to what would be appropriate for a cluster of equal - mass stars .      to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "is the only hnon - like mc code specifically aimed at the study of galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "in addition to relaxation and stellar evolution , it also incorporates a detailed treatment of collisions between single main - sequence stars .",
    "a central massive bh can also be included ( together with a full treatment of tidal disruptions and stellar captures ) but this is not necessary for the work presented here .",
    "individual time steps are used , with particles updated more frequently where the evolution is faster . specifically , the time steps are set to some small fraction @xmath54 of the _ local _ relaxation ( or collision ) time : @xmath55 . at each step , a pair of neighboring particles is selected randomly with probability @xmath56 , ensuring that the _ average _ residence time at @xmath32 is @xmath57 . after a particle is modified ,",
    "the potential , stored in a binary - tree structure , is updated .    unlike relaxation",
    ", collisions can not be treated as a continuous process .",
    "they are discrete events that can affect very significantly the orbits and masses , or even the existence of particles .",
    "when a pair is selected , the collision probability between stars from each particle ( shell ) , @xmath58 is compared with a uniform - deviate random number to decide whether a collision has occurred .",
    "if so , the impact parameter @xmath59 is determined by picking another random number @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "the other parameters of the collision , i.e. , @xmath36 , @xmath38 and @xmath37 , are known from the particle properties .",
    "the final outcome of the collision ( new velocities and masses ) is determined very accurately by interpolation from a table containing the results of more than 14,000 3-d sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) calculations of encounters between two main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "the structure and stellar evolution of collision products is an intricate problem that has only been studied in some detail for low - velocity collisions , relevant to globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the main issues are the importance of entropy stratification versus collisional mixing , and the rapid rotation of merger remnants . in view of these difficulties ,",
    "we use one of two simple prescriptions to treat the stellar evolution of collision products . _",
    "( 1 ) maximal rejuvenation , _ where the remnant is assumed to be completely mixed and is brought back on the zero - age main sequence . as hydrodynamic simulations show only very little mixing , this assumption leads obviously to an overestimate of the stellar lifetime of collision products . _",
    "( 2 ) minimal rejuvenation .",
    "we assume that , during a merger , the helium cores of both parent stars merge together , while the hydrogen envelopes combine to form the new envelope ; no hydrogen is brought to the core .",
    "an effective age on the main sequence is given by adopting a linear dependence of the helium core mass on age .",
    "we have used our code to study the onset of core collapse in young star clusters with a wide variety of initial structures and stellar imfs @xcite .",
    "the results of a typical simulation are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ lr1][lr2 ] .",
    "this simulation was performed for a cluster containing @xmath62 stars with a salpeter imf between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the rapid mass segregation of the most massive stars toward the cluster center is evident , as is the abrupt onset of core collapse once the central region becomes dominated by massive stars . in fig .",
    "[ mass_bins ] we show the evolution of the mean radius of stars in various mass bins .",
    "we see that the mass segregation starts right at the beginning of the evolution and proceeds at a steady rate , even though the overall mass distribution ( total density profile ) in the cluster is hardly changing .",
    "significant changes in the lagrange radii become apparent only when the heaviest stars reach the center of the cluster .",
    "this is because these heaviest stars account for only a very small fraction of the total cluster mass . in all our simulations",
    "we find that the ratio of the core collapse time to initial half - mass relaxation time , @xmath65 , is always within the range 0.050.20 so long as the heaviest stars have masses @xmath66 times the average stellar mass in the cluster .",
    "we used this result [ @xmath67 in section 1.1 to derive our simple criterion for the onset of a runaway . in fig .",
    "[ lr2 ] , we show the core collapse in more detail .",
    "we see that massive stars representing about @xmath68% of the total cluster mass are driving the final core collapse .",
    "this ratio of the collapsing core mass to total cluster mass , @xmath69 , also appears to be confined to a narrow range , of about 0.1%0.3% , in all our calculations to date .",
    "these were performed for both plummer models and king models with varying initial concentration , and for a variety of imfs including simple power - law imfs with exponents in the range 23 ( the standard salpeter value being 2.35 ) .",
    "we have also checked the robustness of this result by varying the number of stars and the time step in our simulations .",
    "as pointed out in section 1.1 , the apparent agreement between this ratio and the ratio of bh mass to total cluster mass in many observed systems is very encouraging .",
    "work is in progress to study more systematically the dependence on initial cluster structure , including the possibility of initial mass segregation .",
    "the formation of a massive central object by runaway collisions and mergers has been demonstrated in idealized fp models of proto - galactic nuclei by qs90 .",
    "unfortunately , because of the limitations of fp codes , these authors had to rely on a highly simplified treatment of collisions ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , they assumed an initial single - mass stellar population , which significantly reduces the impact of mass segregation and stellar evolution .",
    "indeed , these processes come into play only when more massive stars are formed through collisions .    using ,",
    "we have started re - examining this problem with more realistic simulations . in the high - velocity environment of galactic nuclei ,",
    "the formation and/or survival of binaries is unlikely ( i.e. , most binaries are `` soft '' ) , so it is reasonable to neglect them in the computations . as the stellar density rises abruptly to very high values during core collapse ,",
    "collisions are bound to occur even in the absence of binaries .    for definiteness ,",
    "we consider first qs90 s model e4a , starting from a plummer sphere with initial central density and 3d velocity dispersion of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "qs90 started their fp simulations with all stars having @xmath72 and assumed that all collisions lead to mergers with no mass loss and maximal rejuvenation .",
    "not surprisingly , if we use the same , highly simplified treatment of collisions as qs90 , we get clear runaway growth of one or a few particles .",
    "when we switch to our realistic prescription for the collisions and minimal rejuvenation , the runaway still occurs , although later .",
    "however , if we adopt a more realistic , kroupa - type imf @xcite , significant mass loss from the massive stars occurs before core collapse has proceeded to high stellar densities .",
    "as we assume that the gas is not retained in the cluster , this mass loss drives a re - expansion of the whole system . a second",
    ", deeper core collapse occurs later , when the remnant ( stellar - mass ) bhs segregate to the center .",
    "the evolution of this dense cluster of stellar bhs can not be treated with the present version of because dynamically formed binaries will play a central role .",
    "in addition to models with the same densities and velocity dispersions as the class `` a '' considered by qs90 , we also simulated clusters with densities 3  times ( models `` z '' ) and 9  times ( models `` y '' ) larger ( but the same velocity dispersion ) with correspondingly shorter relaxation times ( see fig .  [ fig : condini ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e4z ] , models of class `` z '' have a core collapse time slightly larger than 3myr and do not enter a runaway phase .",
    "one the other hand , runaway growth occurs in all simulations for clusters of class `` y , '' which collapse in about 1myr .",
    "figure  [ fig : runaway ] shows such a case .",
    "the growth of the runaway particle(s ) is limited to a few hundred @xmath73 ( @xmath74 in the `` best '' case ) , probably by some numerical artifact .",
    "note that 500,000 particles were used for all these computations , independent of the true number of stars in the cluster .",
    "hence , every particle represents many stars ( 12 to 36 ) , a numerical treatment whose validity becomes obviously questionable as soon as a single particle detaches from the overall mass spectrum .",
    "in addition , we note that , before the runaway abruptly saturates in our simulations , the growth rate observed is extremely rapid and the basic orbit - averaging assumption implied in the mc technique must probably break down .",
    "possible physical processes that could terminate the runaway include : rapid mass loss from some of the massive stars , increased inefficiency of collisional merging for very massive objects , so considerable extrapolation of our results is required in these simulations . ] , depletion of the `` loss - cone '' orbits that bring stars to the center , or some combination of these factors . in any case , a robust conclusion can be drawn from these simulations , namely that runaway merging can produce stars at least as massive as @xmath75 in the centers of clusters with @xmath76 , even when central velocity dispersions are as high as @xmath77 .",
