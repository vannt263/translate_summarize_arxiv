    "a newly discovered and seemingly isolated neutron star is ( observationally ) classified as a",
    "_ _ magnetar__@xcite ( a source powered by magnetic energy ) when it complies with at least three of the following requirements : comparatively long spin period ; large spin - down rate ( @xmath2 s s@xmath3 ) ; relatively high and variable persistent luminosity ( @xmath4@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) ; emission of powerful short x/@xmath6-ray bursts ( spikes of @xmath70.110 s duration , @xmath8@xmath9 erg s@xmath3 at the peak ) .",
    "just a few years ago , these criteria were thought to be equivalent to that of a surface magnetic field of @xmath10@xmath11 g. the ` magnetar candidates ' , in fact , comprise two classes of sources , the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , which , with no exception at that time , exhibited a surface dipole field ( as derived from the spin down measure ) in excess of the quantum critical field , @xmath12 g.@xcite despite sgrs and axps are far from being a homogeneous class , in particular their magnetic field spans nearly two orders of magnitude , their observational behavior has been assumed as the template for ( active ) magnetars , to the point that the terms sgr / axp and magnetar are often used interchangeably .",
    "this , actually , reflects the original definition of a magnetar as a neutron star which is powered by its ( large ) magnetic field.@xcite in this respect , it is important to notice that a super - strong magnetic field is not per se a sufficient condition for triggering sgr / axp - like activity .",
    "this is testified by the existence of neutron - star sources , for instance most of the so - called high-@xmath13 radio pulsars ( hbpsrs ; e.g. refs .",
    ", ) , and some of the thermally emitting isolated neutron stars ( xdinss ; e.g. ref . ) , with surface magnetic fields comparable to those of sgrs / axps but having substantially different properties and not showing any bursting / outbursting activity over the @xmath71020 yr time span during which they have been observed .    more recently the ` supercritical @xmath13 ' paradigm for the onset of magnetar activity has been challenged the discovery of full - fledged magnetars , sgr0418 + 5729 and swiftj1822.31606 , @xcite with a dipole magnetic field well in the range of ordinary radio pulsars . here",
    "we consider whether the canonical magnetar model still holds in the light of these facts or other models can better explain the observed phenomenology .",
    "section[measb ] is a brief recap of how the magnetic field of isolated pulsars is routinely estimated within the standard magneto - dipole braking framework .",
    "section[observations ] reviews the observational results on sgr0418 + 5729 and swiftj1822.31606 .",
    "sections [ theory ] and [ alternative ] deal with the theoretical context .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes this review with remarks on the definition of magnetar .",
    "the surface dipole magnetic field of a non - accreting pulsar is usually estimated by equating the rate of rotational kinetic energy loss to the power radiated by the rotating dipole . in this way , at the neutron - star magnetic equator , @xmath14 , where the period @xmath15 is measured in s , the period derivative @xmath16 in s s@xmath3 , @xmath17 is the angle between the magnetic moment and the spin axis , and @xmath18 cm and @xmath19 g @xmath20 are the neutron - star radius and moment of inertia .",
    "this inference is model - dependent , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are uncertain , and @xmath17 is generally unknown ( it is usually assumed , for simplicity , to be 90@xmath23 ) , but no direct measurements of the magnetic field strength are available for isolated pulsars . for this reason , one has necessary to rely upon the approximate value from the @xmath24 formula and thus on measurements of the rotational parameters .",
    "the pulsar period and period derivative can be measured with good precision by means of phase - coherent timing ( see e.g. refs . , , ) during extensive observational campaigns .",
    "the basic idea is that in a reference frame that does not accelerate with respect to an isolated pulsar ( to a very good approximation , the centre of mass of the solar system is an inertial reference frame ) , the time evolution of the pulse phase @xmath25 is , in general , expected to be well described by the taylor expansion @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the pulse frequency and @xmath28 is a reference epoch .",
    "the pulsar period and its successive derivatives are thus obtained by the fit of the expansion to the observed data .",
    "as for many recently discovered magnetars,@xcite the existence of sgr0418 + 5729 was revealed by its emission of short bursts . this occurred on 2009 june 5 , when a couple of events triggered the monitors for hard x - ray transients aboard _ fermi _ , _ koronas - foton _ , and _",
    "swift_.@xcite these bursts were comparatively faint ( @xmath29@xmath30 erg s@xmath3 in the band 8200 kev , for a distance2 kpc.@xcite ] @xmath31 kpc ) but otherwise unremarkable , with spectra well described by an optically - thin thermal bremsstrahlung with temperature @xmath3230 kev and duration of @xmath74080 ms.@xcite a third possible ( weaker ) burst , again on june 5 , was found by an off - line inspection of the _",
    "fermi_/gbm data , but it was not confirmed by the simultaneous _ swift_/bat observation ; a search of the interplanetary network events in the period 19902009 did not reveal any past activity clearly associated to sgr0418 + 5729.@xcite    in the following few days , follow - up observations in the soft x - ray band ( 110 kev ) carried out with _ swift _ , _ chandra _ and _ rossixte _ unveiled the existence of a previously unknown bright source , with an observed flux of a few ( previous upper limits , based on _ rosat _ all - sky survey data , were of the order of @xmath33 erg @xmath34 s@xmath3).@xcite these observations also made it possible to measure the source spin period , @xmath35 s.@xcite the results of the first @xmath75 months of monitoring of sgr0418 + 5729 are described in ref .. in each observation the x - ray spectrum could be well described by a single- or two - blackbody model ( depending on the count statistics of the data sets).@xcite during this stretch of time , the source persistent x - ray emission faded by a factor of @xmath710 , with a clear softening with time .",
    "the surprising fact was that , despite the dense monitoring and the long time - span , no slowing of the pulsar rotation could be detected , with a 3@xmath36 upper limit of , translating into an upper limit on the surface dipole magnetic field strength ( see sec.[measb ] ) of @xmath37 g.@xcite",
    "this already made sgr0418 + 5729 the magnetar with the lowest inferred dipole magnetic field .",
    "although indeed small for a magnetar , such a value was not abnormal , the limit being comparable to the strength of @xmath38 g estimated for the dipole magnetic field of the axp 1e2259 + 586 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the limit on the period derivative implied also a limit on the spin - down flux of @xmath39 erg @xmath34 s@xmath3 , showing that the persistent luminosity of the source during the monitoring could not be rotation - powered .    after a period during which the direction of the source was not accessible to the x - ray spacecrafts due to sun constraints , a new observational campaign , mainly aimed at achieving a measurement of the period derivative ,",
    "was undertaken in 2010 july through september using _ swift _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton_. again , the period derivative of sgr0418 + 5729 eluded detection .",
    "this time , however , the limit on the period derivative , obtained through coherent timing over a base line of approximately 500 days , was substantially deviating from what could be expected for a magnetar : @xmath40 s s@xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath41 g ( 90% confidence level).@xcite not only , in fact , this value was significantly below the electron quantum magnetic field @xmath42 g ( a value that , albeit lacking direct physical implications for pulsars , was traditionally considered to be the divide between ordinary pulsars and magnetars ) , but magnetar - like activity ( bursting / outbursting behavior in particular ) had never been observed before in objects with a magnetic field this low ( also the magnetar / pulsar psrj18460258@xmath43 erg s@xmath3 ) powering a bright pulsar wind nebula ; no radio emission has been detected from this pulsar . with an x - ray luminosity well below its spin - down power , it was considered an ordinary rotation - powered pulsar until in 2006 it underwent a magnetar - like outburst accompanied by the emission of several short bursts.@xcite the classification of this source is now debated and it is often indicated as a ` hybrid ' or ` transitional ' object and sometimes counted among magnetars . ] has an inferred surface dipole magnetic field of @xmath44 g , in excess of @xmath45 ) .    since during the summer 2010 the source observed flux was of approximately , the spectrum further softened and there was no sign that the flux decline had stopped , the monitoring of sgr0418 + 5729 was extended using only the high - effective - area detectors on board _ chandra _ ( three pointings between 2010",
    "november and 2011 november ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( four pointings between 2011 march and 2012 august ) .",
    "@xcite in the time span covered by these observations , the source flux apparently settled at about @xmath46@xmath47 erg @xmath34 s@xmath3 , which could be the typical quiescent emission level of sgr0418 + 5729 ( 3 orders of magnitude below that measured at the time of the discovery , see sec.[theory ] for the long - term x - ray light curve ) .",
    "finally , after more than 3 years of monitoring , the measurement of the source spin - down rate was achieved , at a 3.5@xmath36 significance level ( from a coherent timing analysis of all the x - ray data spanning @xmath71200 days ; see refs .",

    "[ tab1 ]      until recently , magnetars were believed to be emitting essentially in the soft x - ray energy range , briefly reaching the soft @xmath6-ray energies during their bursts . thanks to deep surveys and the availability of new instruments , nowadays several magnetars have been observed in the radio@xcite , optical and infrared,@xcite and soft @xmath6-ray@xcite ( as persistent sources ) wavebands .",
    "most counterparts were identified during outbursts,@xcite because during active periods the emission level is in general enhanced at all wavelengths and the rapid flux variability helps in sorting out the true counterpart when there are many candidates .    on 2009",
    "june 19 , ten days after the onset of the outburst , the field of sgr0418 + 5729 was observed by the green bank telescope at 820 mhz but no source was detected , with an limit on the flux density of @xmath570.5 mjy ( for a duty cycle of 20%).@xcite at millimeter wavelengths , five observations were carried out at the plateau de bure interferometer between 2011 june and july ; again , no signal from sgr0418 + 5729 was detected , with a limit of 0.24 mjy at 1.8 mm ( 167 ghz).@xcite the source eluded detection so far also in the optical and infrared bands .",
    "the magnitude limits from observations performed by ground - based instruments ( ref . and references therein ) are @xmath58 ( palomar hale telescope , on 2009 august 2 ) , @xmath59 ( william herschel telescope , on 2009 august 16 ) , and @xmath60 ( gran telescopio canarias , on 2009 september 15 ) . finally , an observation with the _ hubble space telescope _ on 2010 october 19 yielded magnitude limits of 28.6 in the visible ( 5921  ) and 27.4 in the infrared ( 11534 ).@xcite      swiftj1822.31606 was discovered on 2011 july 14 , when it emitted several magnetar - like bursts that were detected by the _ swift_/bat ( see refs . , and references therein ) .",
    "soon after , follow - up observations with _ swift _ and _ rossixte _ led to the detection of a bright x - ray counterpart ( flux of @xmath7@xmath61 erg @xmath34 s@xmath3 in the first days after the onset of the outburst , with a spectrum well described by either a blackbody plus power law or a two - blackbody model ) , pulsating at . the spin period , together with the short bursts and the spectral properties , as well as the lack of an optical or infrared counterpart , confirmed the magnetar nature of the source .",
    "although previously unnoticed , the source was already present in two _ rosat _ x - ray catalogues , having been serendipitously detected in 1993 september 1415 at a flux level of @xmath7@xmath62 erg @xmath34 s@xmath3.@xcite a distance of @xmath71.6 kpc has been proposed on the basis of a possible association , supported by the similar absorption columns , between the source and the hii region m17.@xcite adopting this value , the 1993 luminosity was roughly @xmath63 erg s@xmath3 , while it was @xmath7@xmath64 erg s@xmath3 in 2011 july ( 0.510 kev ) .",
    "after its ( re)discovery , swiftj1822.31606 was intensely monitored between 2011 july and 2012 august using _",

    "revised the spin - down rate and the magnetic field to even lower values of @xmath7@xmath68 s s@xmath3 and @xmath7@xmath69 g. recently , ref . proposed new coherent timing solutions using the data of ref .",

    "these solutions , which differ one from another for the number of frequency derivatives considered in the taylor series used to fit the pulse phase evolution ( see sec.[measb ] ) , yield spin - down rates between approximately and @xmath70 s s@xmath3 , implying a magnetic field between @xmath71 g and @xmath72 g. the reason for these discrepancies and the multiple possible solutions is likely the ` timing noise ' ( e.g. ref . ) , a common phenomenon in young neutron stars and magnetars in particular.@xcite if so , the timing properties of swiftj1822.31606 probably will need longer time to be properly characterized .",
    "nevertheless , any of the values proposed so far in literature would make swiftj1822.31606 the magnetar with the second lowest inferred magnetic field after sgr0418 + 5729 .",
    "finally , also for this source the timing analysis dismisses the possibility that the x - ray emission could be powered to a substantial extent by the loss of rotational energy ( see table[tab1 ] ) .",
    "significant efforts have been devoted to detect emission in energy bands other than x - ray from swiftj1822.31606 but so far , as for sgr0418 + 5729 , without success . at radio frequencies , the field of swiftj1822.31606",
    "was pointed four times between 2011 july and october with the green bank telescope , but no pulsed emission was detected down to a flux density of 0.050.06 mjy.@xcite    an observation with the @xmath73 filter ( 9694  ) was carried out at the gran telescopio canarias on 2011 july 21 , resulting in a limiting magnitude @xmath74.@xcite the field was also serendipitously imaged on 2006 may 3 by the uk infrared telescope ; the analysis of this pre-2011-outburst observation yielded infrared limiting magnitudes @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 ( see ref . and references therein for details on this and other optical and infrared observations ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , overall the observed properties of  and  are not dissimilar from those of other known ( transient ) magnetar candidates.@xcite the blatant difference is in the estimated strength of the dipole field @xmath78 , which is well in the ordinary pulsar range , especially for .",
    "there is , moreover , a further point which sets the two low-@xmath13 sources apart : their long characteristic age , @xmath79 yr , as compared to @xmath80@xmath81@xmath82 yr for the other magnetar candidates .",
    "the latter is clearly a consequence of the former , and both reflect the smallness of the period derivative .    albeit the characteristic age is well known for providing a poor estimate of the neutron star true age , the very large values of @xmath83 may suggest that  and  are old objects . the small number of detected bursts ( with comparatively low energetics ) and the low persistent luminosity in quiescence have been taken as further hints that these might be worn - out magnetars , approaching the end of their active life @xcite .",
    "the ` old magnetar ' scenario sounds appealing since it offers an interpretation of the low-@xmath13 sources within an already established framework , validating the magnetar model also for ( surface ) field strengths quite far away from those of canonical sgrs / axps . at the same time",
    ", it rises a number of crucial questions , chiefly how one can reconcile the low dipole field with the huge magnetic stresses required to deform the crust and produce the bursts / outbursts .",
    "actually , one should bear in mind that the ultimate powerhouse of a ( active ) magnetar is its internal field , its toroidal component in particular .",
    "so , it is possible that in low-@xmath13 magnetars , and in other neutron star sources as well @xcite , the magnetic field is ` hidden ' in the star interior and only a relatively weak dipolar component emerges .",
    "still , if  and  were born with a magnetar - like surface field , @xmath78 must have decayed by a factor @xmath8010100 to match the current values .",
    "roughly the same reduction is expected in the internal field .",
    "although the latter could initially be @xmath8010 times higher than @xmath78 ( at least locally ) , one may wonder if at late times internal magnetic stresses are still strong enough to crack the crust .",
    "a second and related question is if realistic models of field decay in magnetars can account for the observed rotational properties ( period , period derivative ) and quiescent luminosity of  and .",
    "this also directly bears to the true age of the sources which are most probably ( much ) younger than their characteristic age , estimated assuming a non - decaying field",
    ".      the more general configuration for the internal field in a neutron star will be that produced by the superposition of current systems in the core and the crust . as stressed by ref .",
    ", the relative contribution of the core / crustal fields is likely different in different types of neutron stars . in old radio pulsars , where no field decay is observed , the long - lived core component may dominate , while a sizable",
    ", more volatile crustal field is probably present in magnetars , for which substantial field decay over a timescale @xmath80@xmath81@xmath84 yr is expected ( see e.g. ref . ) .    in magnetars , because of the lesser role of ambipolar diffusion in the core,@xcite the decay / evolution of the magnetic field is likely to take place in the crust and is governed by hall / ohmic diffusion .",
    "the relative importance of these two mechanisms is strongly density- and temperature - dependent .",
    "thus , any self - consistent study of the magnetic field evolution must be coupled to a detailed modeling of the neutron star thermal evolution , and conversely .",
    "this basically means that the induction equation for @xmath85 must be solved together with the cooling , a quite challenging numerical task .    in recent years",
    ", much efforts have been devoted to this problem @xcite .",
    "the state - of - the - art numerical code is that of ref . , which features full magneto - thermal coupling and includes all realistic microphysics .",
    "however , owing to numerical difficulties in treating the hall term , the models in ref . include only ohmic diffusion .",
    "this can be a limitation because the hall drift likely drastically affects the very early evolution of ultra - magnetized neutron stars with surface field @xmath86  g. however , for lower @xmath78 , still well within the magnetar range , the effect of the hall drift is expected to introduce at the most quantitative changes ( a somewhat faster dissipation ) with respect to the purely ohmic picture . very recently a code capable of properly handling the hall term has been presented @xcite , but applications to neutron star magneto - thermal evolution are still to come .    in order to explore if , and to which extent , the magneto - thermal evolution of ( initially ) highly magnetic neutron stars can lead to objects with properties compatible with those of  and , refs . and performed a number of runs using the code of ref .. results for the two sources are shown in figs .",
    "[ magevol-0418 ] and [ magevol-1822 ] .",
    "the main outcome is that magnetic field decay in an initially ultra - magnetized neutron star , @xmath87 g , can reproduce the observed @xmath15 , @xmath51 , @xmath78 and @xmath88 in  and , for an age @xmath71 myr and @xmath70.5 myr , respectively , provided that the initial internal toroidal field @xmath89 , the key parameter , is high enough , @xmath7@xmath90 g in the former and @xmath7@xmath91 g in the latter .",
    "evolutionary calculations confirm that these are old sources , as expected , although the true age is shorter than @xmath83 , the difference being more than one order of magnitude for .",
    "recently ref . used the magnetic evolution code of ref . together with the cooling models by ref . to compute",
    "the magnetic stresses acting on the neutron - star crust at different times .",
    "their baseline model has @xmath92  g and @xmath93  g. they found that the occurrence of crustal fractures ( and hence of bursts / outbursts ) is not restricted to the early neutron star life , during which the surface field is ultra - strong , but can extend to late phases ( @xmath80@xmath84@xmath94 yr ; see their figure 2 ) .",
    "both the energetic and the recurrence time of the events evolve as the star ages . for ` old ' magnetars about @xmath95",

    "the radiation radius of the emitting area(s ) is small @xmath800.11 km and usually decreases in time .",
    "this has been interpreted as due to some form of heat deposition in a limited region of the star surface which then cools and shrinks . up to now , however , the heating mechanism has not been unanimously assessed .",
    "a possibility is that energy is injected deep in the crust , e.g. because of magnetic dissipation , and then flows to the surface @xcite .",
    "alternatively , heating may be produced by currents flowing in a twisted magnetosphere as they hit the star @xcite .",
    "very recently , ref . developed a quantitative model for the outburst evolution by simulating the thermal relaxation of the neutron star in response to an impulsive energy injection in the star crust .",
    "results were successfully applied by ref . to fit the outburst decay in for the entire period covered by their observations , @xmath7250  d after the first burst that led to the discovery of the source ( see fig.[outb-1822 ] ) .",
    "the case of , for which a much longer time coverage is available ( @xmath71200  d ) , is , however , much less conclusive in this respect @xcite ( see fig.[outb-0418 ] ) .",
    "the calculated flux in the 0.510 kev band systematically underestimates the observed one at later times ( @xmath102400  d ) , when the luminosity suddenly drops and the hotter blackbody ( initially at @xmath103  kev ) disappears leaving only a cooler component at @xmath70.3  kev .",
    "as discussed in ref . , because of the limited spatial extent of the twist and hence of the low luminosity released by ohmic dissipation , current heating is also unlikely to explain the observed flux in .",
    "only a long term monitor will assess if  is indeed peculiar , or also  is bound to show the same behavior at late times .",
    "although many indirect evidences accumulated in favor of the magnetar paradigm ( e.g. refs . , ) and despite it proved to be quite successful in explaining the observed properties of sgrs / axps , including those of the low-@xmath13 sources , no conclusive , direct measure of the surface magnetic field has been claimed as of yet .",
    "contrary to other classes of x - ray pulsars , in which it has been possible to infer @xmath78 from the detection of ( electron ) cyclotron lines in their spectra@xcite ( see e.g ref . for a review ) , up to now spin - down remains the only way for sgrs / axps , with all the ensuing uncertainties ( chiefly the fact that spin - down is indeed due to magneto - dipole losses alone ) .",
    "since the cyclotron energy for a particle of charge @xmath104 and mass @xmath105 is ( here @xmath106 is the electron mass ) , the electron line falls well above the x - ray range for fields @xmath107 , becoming inaccessible to observations .",
    "however , the proton line , at @xmath7@xmath108 is squarely in the x - ray band for magnetars .",
    "proton cyclotron lines in magnetar atmospheres have been extensively investigated @xcite and searched for in virtually all available observations but escaped unambiguous detection .",
    "the lack of a smoking gun , definitely proving that magnetar candidates host an ultra - magnetized neutron star , stimulated in the past the investigation of alternative scenarios , which could explain the observed characteristics of sgrs / axps without resorting to ultra - strong magnetic fields .",
    "the recent discovery of low-@xmath13 sources , with magneto - rotational properties similar to those of standard radio pulsars , renewed this interest .",
    "a long - standing competitor of the magnetar scenario has been the fossil - disc model , according to which sgrs / axps harbor a neutron star with standard magnetic field ( @xmath80@xmath109@xmath110 ) which is effectively spun down by the interaction with a debris disc left in the parent supernova explosion or after a common envelope phase , e.g. refs . , , and . according to ref .",

    "a somehow similar scenario in which sgrs / axps are neutron stars with a low dipole field and super - strong multipolar components powered by accretion from a fall - back disc was recently proposed .",
    "models not invoking neutron stars at all have also been discussed .",
    "massive ( @xmath7@xmath1121.4 @xmath113 ) white dwarfs endowed with high ( on white - dwarfs standards ) magnetic fields were suggested as possible powerhouses@xcite .",

    "this implies that rotational energy losses can be large enough to explain the observed x - ray luminosity in sgrs / axps ( @xmath80@xmath115@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) even for quite low values of the period derivative .",
    "in addition , since @xmath116 , the dipolar magnetic field derived from spin - down is much lower in a white dwarf than in a neutron star with the same @xmath15 and @xmath51 .",

    "all the sgrs / axps activity ( bursts , outbursts , giant flares ) is powered by the relief of mechanical stresses , driven by gravity overcoming centrifugal forces as the white dwarf spins down . the change in the star oblateness produces a decrease of the moment of inertia and , in turn , a sudden increase of the spin frequency ( a glitch ) .",
    "the energy which can be tapped is @xmath80@xmath119 of the available gravitational energy , @xmath120 . in order to accommodate the energetic of bursts and also of the giant flares , which is several orders of magnitude larger,@xcite the white - dwarf model requires @xmath121 in the range @xmath80@xmath122@xmath123 .",
    "the fastest spinning sgrs / axps ( @xmath124 s ) might pose a problem for the stability of white dwarfs .",
    "however , according to recent calculations@xcite , the minimum period of a rotating , massive white dwarf could be as small as 0.3 s.    a more exotic scenario involves quark stars ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "a neutron star could evolve into a quark star following an increase of its core density due to spin down or accretion .",
    "a quark nova explosion ( releasing gravitational energy up to @xmath80@xmath125 erg , mostly carried away by neutrinos ) would mark this transition and cause the ejection of the neutron star iron - rich outer layers .",
    "depending on the quark star initial spin frequency , the degenerate debris material would either form a shell co - rotating with the star or be confined in a keplerian ring ( in the case of fast rotation ) .",
    "sgrs / axps are , then , the observational manifestation of these quark star  ring / shell systems .",
    "such quark stars are expected to be ultra - magnetized , because color ferromagnetism in the quark matter can give rise to a surface magnetic field of @xmath80@xmath11 g at the birth .",
    "the star spins down because of magnetic braking and expels from its superfluid / superconducting interior magnetic vortices . as a consequence , its magnetic field decreases and magnetic reconnections at the star surface produces an x - ray luminosity @xmath126 erg s@xmath3 , where @xmath127 is the period derivative in units of @xmath128 s s@xmath3 and @xmath129 is an efficiency parameter .",
    "in addition , quark star ",
    "ring systems can emit x - rays from a hot spot formed where steadily accreted ring matter hits the surface .",
    "transient magnetars are quark star ",
    "ring sources that only sporadically enter phases of steady accretion . both shell and ring systems would produce bursts when clumps of debris degenerate material are accreted onto the star , the shell systems being the most burst - prolific sources , since the co - rotating shell is an inherently - less - stable structure than the ring .    in this picture ,",
    "is an evolved quark star ",
    "ring system that has almost consumed its ring , after which it will join other old shell- and ring - less systems with low vortex luminosity corresponding , in this scenario , to the xdinss .",
    "the characteristic age of  in the quark - nova scenario ( where the braking index is @xmath130 ) is @xmath131 myrs and at this age the magnetic field is expected to have been decayed from the initial value of @xmath7@xmath11 g to below @xmath7@xmath10 g. reference shows that the rotational and magnetic characteristics of  can account for many of the properties of the source observed during the first @xmath7160 days of the 2009 outbursts .",
    "the discovery of low-@xmath13 magnetar sources has opened new perspectives in neutron - star astrophysics and its consequences deeply impact on our current view of what a ` magnetar ' is . as it was discussed in sec.[theory ] ,  and  are likely to be ` old magnetars ' , i.e. once - ultra - magnetized neutron stars which experienced substantial field decay over their ( extended , @xmath801  myr ) lifetime .",
    "still , they retain a large - enough ( @xmath80@xmath132  g ) internal toroidal field , sufficient to sporadically produce crustal displacements and hence bursting activity .    in this sense , the original definition of a ` magnetar ' as a neutron star powered by magnetic energy@xcite applies to the low - field sources too , at least if one restricts to their active phases .",
    "what the low-@xmath13 sources taught us is that this reservoir of magnetic energy ( stored in the internal field ) needs not to show up at all .",
    "the external field in a active magnetar can well be comparable to that of radio pulsars , dispelling the widespread belief that magnetar activity is necessary associated to an ultra - high dipole field .",
    "the two known low - field sources ,  and , are likely not exceptions . since they represent the ` old ' population of initially strongly - magnetized neutron stars , they may constitute the majority of magnetar candidates , although their duty cycle is long .",
    "actually , about 20% of galactic radio pulsars have a dipole field higher that that of  @xcite and in principle any of them may show up as a transient magnetar at any time .",
    "we are indebted to our too - numerous - to - mention collaborators on works on magnetars , most notably the ` italian magnetar group ' .",
    "we also wish to thank the organizers and the speakers of the 13th marcel grossmann meeting for the excellent conference .",
    "we acknowledge partial funding from inaf through a prin-2011 grant .",
