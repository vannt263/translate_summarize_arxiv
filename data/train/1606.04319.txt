    "the quantitative study of the productive and communication aspects of science , known as _ scientometrics _",
    ", is nowadays well established .",
    "this discipline focuses mainly on the analysis of citation statistics of the academic literature in order to identify suitable indicators for the impact of research  @xcite .",
    "well - known and widely used examples of impact indicators include the journal impact factor  @xcite and the @xmath0-index  @xcite , but several ( more than one hundred  @xcite ) alternatives have been proposed ",
    "see  @xcite for recent reviews of the field .",
    "importantly , these metrics are intended to measure scientific impact , and not quality or importance . yet",
    ", nowadays they play a central role in the measurement and evaluation of research performance ( at the level of individual researchers , research groups and institutions ) , despite the numerous warnings from the scientific community  @xcite .",
    "the issue is critical especially at the level of individual researchers , as it can affect received funds and grants  not to mention employment and career .",
    "recently , wildgaard and colleagues  @xcite pointed out the need to examine author - level indicators in relation to what they are supposed to reflect and especially to their specific limitations .",
    "indeed , by comparing the key concepts of several metrics , they showed that no indicator alone can capture the overall impact of a researcher , which is instead better characterized by a combination of indexes .",
    "such a combination is however not unique , and depends on the particular type of assessment to be made .",
    "evaluation of impact indicators is also complicated by the availability and reliability of the bibliometric databases ( such as _ web of science _ , _ scopus _ , _ google scholar _ and _ microsoft academic search _ )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , these databases suffer to various extent from the lack of quality control  @xcite and partial coverage .",
    "the latter problem is relevant especially in the fields of social sciences and humanities  @xcite , which may have a strong national or even regional orientation and thus target local journals and books  @xcite , and for computer science and engineering  where conference proceedings play an important role , but they are ofter not counted or counted twice ( as the work is published both as proceedings and as regular journal paper ) .",
    "all these facts cause the measured impact of a researcher to depend on the specific data used in the calculation  @xcite . besides",
    ", these data are polluted by improper citation practices used by researchers ( like boosting self or friend s citations , or satisfying referees ) that are not related at all to the acknowledgment of a paper s importance  @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the scientific community has devoted much effort to unveil the dynamics of the citation process , the main focus being that of explaining the extremely skewed distribution of the number of citations received by scientific papers ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "notably , in 1976 price  @xcite was the first to tackle this issue by using a model based on preferential attachment , a process for which some quantity associated to the entities of a system ( the number of citations of scientific publications , in our context ) is distributed and grows according to how much these entities already have .",
    "later , this model has been much studied and generalized ( see  @xcite for a review of the field ) . importantly , the original version of the model predicts a strong relation between a paper s age and its citation count , but significant deviations from this behavior are found in bibliometric data  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that to model citation dynamics well , preferential attachment has to be combined with intrinsic paper _ relevance _ : a heterogeneously distributed `` quality '' ( fitness ) that decays with time  @xcite .",
    "these models are then capable of generating artificial data that closely resemble real citation networks  @xcite .",
    "building on this modeling framework , we aim to perform a comparative evaluation of various scientific impact indicators , in the same spirit of  @xcite but on a quantitative basis provided by the use of an artificial setting .",
    "in particular , we extend a previous model constrained on the citation dynamics of scientific papers  @xcite by assuming that researchers are endowed with intrinsic productivity and ability levels  the latter determining the fitness of their authored papers , that in turn make connections to the existing body of literature according to the modified preferential attachment mechanism described above .",
    "the artificial bibliometric data generated by the model then allow us to compute a variety of impact indicators , which can be compared with the individual traits of researchers in order to determine what these indicators actually capture .",
    "we can thus identify the indicators which properly rank authors , and those that fail in this task .",
    "notably , our controlled and simplified setup has the advantage to generate citation records which are free from the biases present in real databases that can hinder this kind of analyses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the model used to generate citation data , and section iii provides the definitions of the impact indicators that we compare and evaluate .",
    "results of the analysis are reported in section iv , while section v concludes the work and outlines the possibilities for further improving the artificial framework by including additional relevant aspects of the citation dynamics , such as differences between scientific disciplines  @xcite and journal reputation  @xcite ( see  @xcite for recent progresses in modeling the various aspects of the research and citation process ) .",
    "in this work we use a model which extends the one suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the system is composed of researchers ( or authors ) and papers , indicated by latin and greek letters respectively .",
    "time runs in discrete time steps corresponding to months , and the simulation spans over @xmath2 months .",
    "there are @xmath3 authors in the system . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume that their number is fixed and that they are all active during the whole simulation , but this assumption is relaxed later on .",
    "each author @xmath4 is characterized by ability @xmath5 and productivity @xmath6 ( _ i.e. _ , the total number of papers that @xmath4 will co - author ) . in line with the exponential distribution of total paper relevance presented in  @xcite",
    ", author ability is drawn from the exponential distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 , acting as the minimal author ability , is motivated by the presence of some `` entrance barriers '' in academia which guarantee that all authors have some minimal ability value and thus their papers have some minimal level of relevance to the community .",
    "author productivity is drawn from @xmath9 $ ] which has been obtained by fitting the real distribution of authored papers in the microsoft academic search ( mas ) data ; see figure  [ fig : empirical](a ) and the description therein .    in each time",
    "step @xmath10 , papers are gradually introduced in the system . for each paper @xmath11",
    ", we build its set of authors @xmath12 as follows .",
    "we first draw the number of authors @xmath13 from the distribution @xmath14 , which is again motivated by the mas data  see figure  [ fig : empirical](b ) .",
    "we then choose the @xmath15 different authors , each with probability proportional to the remaining number of papers that they still have to author ( for researcher @xmath4 , this number is initially @xmath6 , and then decreases by 1 with each authored paper ) .",
    "the fitness value @xmath16 of the paper is proportional to the highest ability value among its authors : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a multiplicative noise term that is uniformly distributed in @xmath19 $ ] and introduces additional randomness to the process of paper creation .",
    "note that because of the extremal metric choice , paper fitness is not directly proportional to the number of authors .",
    "this assumption is motivated by recent empirical evidence : while papers with more authors receive on average more citations , this effect is apparently not related to papers quality  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , results obtained upon varying this and other assumptions are presented in the supporting information ( si ) .",
    "newly introduced papers make links to previously published papers .",
    "the probability that paper @xmath11 cites paper @xmath20 at time @xmath21 is @xmath22\\,f_{\\beta}d(t - \\tau_{\\beta})}{\\omega(t)},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the current number of citations of paper @xmath20 and @xmath24 is its appearance time in the system , whereas , @xmath25 is the aging term and @xmath26 is the normalization term @xmath27\\,f_{\\gamma}d(t - \\tau_{\\gamma}).\\ ] ] here , @xmath23 needs to be increased by one to give a non - zero initial attractiveness to papers , as @xmath28 . in equation  ( [ linkingp ] ) , we use exponential aging @xmath29 where @xmath30 characterizes the lifetime of a paper .",
    "an alternative choice would be to use a log - normal shape for the aging term  @xcite .",
    "every new paper makes @xmath31 references to existing papers .",
    "note that when a growing network with preferential attachment grows from a small initial configuration , papers that are present at early stages are in advantage with respect to later papers and can thus achieve a significantly higher citation count  @xcite .",
    "early papers enjoy the undue advantage during the initial period when @xmath26 is substantially smaller than its long - term stationary value @xmath32 . to overcome this problem",
    ", we assume that when @xmath33 , each of the @xmath31 links created by a newly added paper points to an existing paper with probability @xmath34 . in the complementary case",
    ", the link points out from the system and none of the existing papers receives it .",
    "this situation resembles a young scientific field which is growing , yet still partially relying on papers from other fields .",
    "the stationary value @xmath35 is obtained by simulating the system for a sufficiently long time period and averaging the final @xmath26 over independent model realizations ( values used in our simulations are specified in the si ) .",
    "the complete simulation code can be found at http://www.ddp.fmph.uniba.sk/~medo/physics/resources.html .    _ simulation parameters and dynamics_. we simulate systems with @xmath36 authors over the time period of @xmath37 months .",
    "paper lifetime is @xmath38 months , and @xmath8 is set to @xmath39 ( note that while the use of @xmath8 is not essential , figure [ fig : s1 ] in the si shows that @xmath40 actually improves the agreement between empirical and model citation distribution ) .",
    "each paper cites @xmath41 other papers , and fitness values are obtained with @xmath42 . for our choice of the productivity distribution ,",
    "the average author produces 5 papers and the most active author produces around 200 papers in total . in each month",
    ", several papers are introduced in the system so that , until the end of simulation , every author eventually produces the originally assigned number of papers . to achieve this",
    ", we endow each researcher with an activity counter @xmath43 , initially set to @xmath6 . at step",
    "@xmath21 ( when there are @xmath44 time steps left until the end of the simulation ; @xmath10 ) , we introduce new papers until the researcher activity counters decrease by @xmath45 in total . due to the varying number of co - authors , the number of papers introduced at each step fluctuates but remains relatively stable during the whole simulation .",
    "the total number of papers produced in a single realization of the system is around 1500 .",
    "figure  [ fig : calibration ] reports basic calibration results for the model .",
    "in particular , panel ( c ) shows that the emergent citation distribution closely resembles the one observed for mas data ( see figure [ fig : s1 ] in the si for how the shape of this distribution changes when @xmath8 and @xmath30 are varied ) .",
    "further , panel ( d ) shows that allowing some links to point out from the system indeed weakens the dependence of the paper citation count on its appearance time . for",
    "the present choice of parameters , correlation between paper citation count and fitness is around 0.5 . in agreement with empirical studies of popularity in real systems  @xcite",
    ", we see that while papers with high fitness on average attract more citations than papers with low fitness , there is still a substantial level of randomness in this relationship .",
    "we conclude this section by remarking that we use empirical data from mas only to calibrate the model : to measure the distributions of author productivity and of the number of co - authors per paper , and finally to fit the paper citation distribution . since the shape of these distributions is rather general ,",
    "using a different bibliometric dataset is not likely to qualitatively change the results of our analysis : the model is naturally flexible to adapt to other real datasets .",
    "we now introduce the indicators that we use to quantify the scientific impact of authors . in the following definitions",
    ", we will use quantities obtained at the end of simulations but omit the time label @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , @xmath46 denotes the number of citations paper @xmath11 accrued at @xmath47 .",
    "we define :    @xmath48 _ total number of citations _ , @xmath49 . the simplest possible choice , naturally favoring researchers with many papers and those who are active since long .    @xmath48 _ average number of citations _ , @xmath50 .",
    "this approach is widely used in the literature , the underlying idea being that whenever a researcher receives a larger credit compared to the number of papers published , she is producing science having greater impact . note that here we are considering only a single scientific field , and thus we do not need to worry about field - specific normalization  @xcite . in this way , average citations is equivalent to both the well - known @xmath51 ( citations per publication over mean field citation score ) and @xmath52 ( mean normalized citation score ) indicators  @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 _ citation count of the most cited paper _ , @xmath53 .",
    "this is an extremal metric that is influenced by the heavy - tailed distribution of the paper citation count , and thus should be used with caution .",
    "@xmath48 _ @xmath54-index _  @xcite , the number of papers published by an author that are in the top @xmath55 most cited papers .",
    "this approach explicitly takes into account the extreme skewness of the citation distribution , which may cause average - based indicators to fail because of their sensitivity to the presence of one or a few very highly cited publications  @xcite .",
    "percentile - based indicators like @xmath54 are instead less sensitive to these outliers  @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 _ @xmath0-index _  @xcite .",
    "given the set @xmath56 of papers authored by @xmath4 ordered by citation count in decreasing order ( _ i.e. _ , such that @xmath57 , @xmath58 $ ] ) , the @xmath0-index is the last position in which @xmath59 is greater than or equal to the position @xmath60 : @xmath61\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    @xmath48 _ contemporary @xmath0-index _ ( @xmath62 )  @xcite , obtained by giving more weight to recent papers . in particular , citations to papers published @xmath63",
    "years ago are weighted with @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath62-index is then computed as the @xmath0-index on the weighted citation counts .",
    "@xmath48 _ @xmath1-index _  @xcite .",
    "given the ordering @xmath65 , the @xmath1-index is the ( unique ) largest number such that the top @xmath1 articles received , together , at least @xmath66 citations : @xmath67    @xmath48 _ @xmath68-index _  @xcite .",
    "geometric mean of @xmath69 and @xmath0 : @xmath70 .",
    "the idea is that @xmath69 accounts for the researchers greatest results and @xmath0 for their diligence .",
    "thus , differently from the @xmath0-index , the @xmath68-index does not ignore the tail of the citation record .",
    "@xmath48 _ normalized @xmath0-index _",
    "( @xmath71 , or _ @xmath72-quotient _ )  @xcite , obtained as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the time since the first publication of researcher @xmath4 .",
    "this indicator is mainly aiming to identify young and promising scientists , as usually citation - based metrics favor senior researchers who had enough time to attract citations to their work @xcite .",
    "note that , apart from the @xmath54-index , all the metrics listed here can be computed for an individual researcher using solely her own citation records , _ i.e. _ , without knowledge of citation statistics for the whole scientific community .",
    "this feature makes these indices apt for practical applications , as usually the whole dataset is unaccessible or very hard to handle ( especially by individual researchers ) . in this respect ,",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath54-index in our analysis is mainly for completeness  actually , @xmath54 is used mostly to compare not single researchers , but research institutions or communities at larger scales .",
    "we remark that various metrics of scientific impact are not considered here for several reasons .",
    "for instance , in our simplified framework we model only one scientific area and one general publication venue , and thus it makes no sense to test metrics accounting for the research field @xcite nor those based on comparing the total number of citations of a paper to those of other publications in the same journal  @xcite .",
    "additionally , in our setting all co - authors are assumed to contribute to a paper equally , their activity decreases by 1 for every publication regardless of the number of co - authors , and the fitness of that paper does not scale with the number of co - authors .",
    "thus , we can not consider metrics that incorporate the relative contribution of each co - author to a paper , like the _ individual h - index _",
    "@xcite or the @xmath75 ( `` sequence - determines - credit '' )  approach @xcite do . nor we consider indices accounting for the quality of the citations in terms of the collaboration distance between citing and cited authors @xcite , as we do not model the presence of research groups .",
    "finally , we do not consider metrics based on the _ eigenvector centrality _ within the citation network  @xcite , such as pagerank  @xcite , citerank  @xcite or physauthorrank  @xcite .",
    "this is because the linking probability defined by eq .",
    "( [ linkingp ] ) depends only on the fitness of the target paper @xmath20 , and not on the fitness of the source paper @xmath11 . as a result ,",
    "citations from a highly valued paper have the same intrinsic value as citations from an ordinary paper , and differentiating the weight of incoming citations thus can not yield any improvements . upon calibration on real data ,",
    "our modeling framework can be extended to include many of the aforementioned effects and thus allow more metrics to be evaluated .",
    "we now assess the impact indicators against the `` ground truth '' provided by the intrinsic features of researchers in the model .",
    "in particular , we consider four different benchmarks : two intensive quantities ( _ i.e. _ , not depending on the number of authored papers ) , researcher ability @xmath5 and average fitness of authored papers @xmath76 , and two extensive quantities ( _ i.e. _ , accounting for the number of authored papers ) , researcher ability times productivity @xmath77 and total fitness of authored papers @xmath78 .",
    "note that for each pair of benchmarks , the first quantity refers to the researchers potential , whereas , the second one is related to their actually realized publication output .    in order to evaluate a given impact indicator",
    ", we first use the ground truth to determine the set of 100 best authors .",
    "we then determine the set of the top 100 best - evaluated authors according to their impact score . finally , we count the overlap @xmath79 between these two sets of researchers .",
    "the relative overlap @xmath80 , which ranges from @xmath81 to @xmath39 , is then a measure of the metric s performance ( the higher the overlap , the more successful the impact metric in identifying the best researchers ) which is commonly referred to as _ precision _ in information filtering literature  @xcite .",
    "note that in this specific setting , another classical metric , _ recall _ , is also equal to @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "we evaluate precision achieved by individual metrics on 100 independent model evaluations , that are then used to compute the average precision and the standard error of the mean .",
    "figure  [ fig : results - basic ] summarizes the metric evaluation results for the basic model setting described in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we see that when the ground truth is an intensive quantity ( author ability in panel ( a ) or average fitness of the authored papers in panel ( b ) ) , the simple average citation score @xmath82 is by far the best performing indicator among the described group of traditional performance metrics . when considering extensive ground truths , the family of @xmath0-indices expectedly becomes more reliable : @xmath0 , @xmath62 and @xmath1 are tied for the first place . since in this basic setting all researchers are in principle active from the beginning of the simulation , the @xmath72-quotient lags behind the original @xmath0 because of its uneven handling of researchers who have few papers and by chance started publishing late .",
    "the recently proposed @xmath68-index always performs midway between the @xmath0-index and @xmath69 ( the citation count of the most cited paper ) , which suggests that the combination of these two quantities is not particularly effective in discerning the best researchers .",
    "the @xmath54-index does not perform well in any of the evaluations , mainly due to its reliance on a small subset of all papers ( top 1% ) which makes it simultaneously a noisy and little discriminative metric for evaluation of individuals .",
    "total citation count @xmath83 lags behind @xmath0-like metrics which is not surprising as it is highly sensitive to outliers .    to overcome the observed problems of certain metrics , we explore some variants that could possibly fare better .",
    "firstly , to cope with outliers , we introduce the total logarithmic citation count @xmath84 ( the citation count @xmath85 is incremented by one to avoid @xmath86 for papers with zero citations ) and the mean logarithmic citation count @xmath87 .",
    "figure  [ fig : results - basic ] shows that @xmath88 matches the good performance of the mean citation count @xmath82 for both intensive benchmarks .",
    "by contrast , @xmath89 slightly outperforms ( approximately by 4% ) the established metrics for the extensive benchmarks , yet it has to be noted that the total logarithmic citation count is a considerably simpler metric than @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that the use of a logarithmic unit of measure is an efficient way to deal with the skewness of the citation distribution .",
    "as for the @xmath72-quotient , its flaw is to allow many young authors who have only authored one or a few papers to score well , because their @xmath0-indices are divided by their small author age . while in real use this bias may be avoided by , _",
    "e.g. _ , selection committees enforcing explicit conditions on applicants ( for instance , at least 3 years after the phd defense , or a minimum number of publications ) , here we explore a mathematically grounded solution by formulating a _ corrected @xmath72-quotient _ ( @xmath90 ) : @xmath91 , where the second term penalizes researchers with very few authored papers ( for example , @xmath92 for all authors with only one publication ) .",
    "as figure  [ fig : results - basic ] shows , such a corrected @xmath72-quotient then performs better than its original version and also outperforms the established metrics , though to a lesser extent than @xmath89 .",
    "figure [ fig : s2 ] in the si further shows how the performance of individual metrics change when individual model assumptions and parameters are varied .",
    "we see that while the choice of parameters has some impact on the achieved precision values , the best results are always obtained with the same set of metrics : @xmath82 and @xmath88 with respect to intensive ground truths , and the family of @xmath0-indices and @xmath89 with respect to extensive ground truths .",
    "notably , the best performer @xmath89 is closely followed by the long - standing @xmath0-index in all studied settings , while some other well performing metrics slightly fall behind under certain circumstances ( _ e.g. _ , the @xmath1-index when the number of researchers in the simulated system is increased ) .",
    "overall , we can conclude that the main results that we report here are robust with respect to substantial variations of the model and of its parameters .",
    "we now wish to study the case where new authors are gradually introduced to the system , and check which indicators allow to fairly evaluate young researchers with respect to their senior colleagues .",
    "we thus consider a situation where @xmath93 of researchers are active for the whole time ; for the remaining @xmath94 , author @xmath4 begins their activity in a randomly chosen step @xmath74 between @xmath95 and @xmath96 . here 36",
    "is subtracted to only include researchers who spent sufficient time in the system ( by doing so , we are essentially considering only researchers who finished their phd studies ) . in this",
    "setting , the productivity of author @xmath4 , initially drawn from @xmath97 , is linearly rescaled by her appearance time in the system by a factor @xmath98 : young authors are thus in disadvantage with respect to seniors by having on average less publications at the end of the simulation , and also by having had less time to accrue citations .",
    "figure  [ fig : results - changing_group ] presents the results obtained with this setting .",
    "the first observation is that most metrics actually perform similarly than in the basic setting where the group of active researchers does not change over time .",
    "the only metric that considers authors career length , @xmath72-quotient , is surprisingly performing worse in the new setting with researchers gradually entering the system .",
    "the reason lies again in the aforementioned rescaling problem : in the new setting , there are more young users who only author their papers in the last years and yet outperform venerable researchers upon the rescaling , thus lowering the resulting precision more than in the basic setting presented in figure  [ fig : results - basic ] . specifically , there are on average @xmath99 authors with only one publication in the top 100 positions of the ranking by the @xmath72-quotient and the average activity span of top 100 researchers is @xmath100 months ( out of @xmath101 in total ) .",
    "by contrast , for the @xmath0-index ranking there are no authors with only one publication in top 100 and the average activity span of top researchers is @xmath102 months .",
    "the bias towards very young researchers is removed by the corrected @xmath72 , which brings to no researchers with only one paper in top 100 and to an average activity span of @xmath103 months : the resulting precision is similar to that achieved with the @xmath0-index and the contemporary @xmath0-index .",
    "overall , the logarithm - based indices @xmath88 and @xmath89 are again the best performers against intensive and extensive ground truths , respectively .",
    "we conclude by discussing the choice of optimal benchmarks to evaluate impact indicators against .",
    "on one hand , extensive ground truths are more appropriate when we assume that all researchers are active for the whole time period .",
    "this is because intensive benchmarks neglect productivity , and thus do not penalize gifted but little active researchers who produce only a few ( though very good ) papers . on the other hand ,",
    "when considering researchers with different activity lifetime , extensive ground truths automatically give preference to authors who are active since longer , thus using intensive benchmarks may be more appropriate in this case . yet , because of their own nature , intensive criteria are unable to properly handle authors with very low activity and thus little citation statistics .",
    "relying on an `` intermediate '' ground truth could represent a suitable solution , albeit its precise form is certainly arbitrary .",
    "our artificial framework makes it easy to evaluate impact indicators with respect to a different ground truth assumption .",
    "figures  [ fig : s3 ] and [ fig : s4 ] in the si show results for two intermediate benchmarks : researcher ability times square root of productivity @xmath104 and an analogous multiple of the average fitness of the authored papers @xmath105 .",
    "we observe no major changes with respect to the purely extensive benchmarks , supposedly because activity values are broadly distributed : even after the square root is applied , substantial activity is still needed to access the top 100 of the new ground truth . from the viewpoint of evaluating researchers ,",
    "the dual intensive - extensive approach used here thus seems sufficient .",
    "there are some particular aspects though , such as the ability of a metric to identify young talented researchers , that can only be captured by ground truths that specifically target at the feature of interest ( researchers active for less than six years , for example ) .",
    "construction of such ground truths and their use in the proposed model - based evaluation framework remain as open issues for future research .",
    "the ongoing proliferation of scientific impact indicators is facilitated by the critical lack of solid evaluation criteria . presently , motivation for new metrics is sometimes only anecdotal and their evaluation often relies on outliers analysis  @xcite .",
    "however , outliers in any metric are almost inevitably highly successful authors or highly cited papers  such validation is thus very soft and eliminates only the most ill - suited metrics .",
    "the absence of a `` golden standard '' ( certified best papers and researchers ) for validation of indicators on real data compels the use of various _ ad - hoc _ proxies , such as relying on experts judgment . in this work , building on an artificial model of citation dynamics , we have established a test bench where new and old metrics can face their first examination .",
    "the use of a controlled framework allowed us to avoid the biases present in real citation databases related to coverage issues and to improper citation practices  @xcite and , more importantly , to have ground truth features to evaluate impact indicators against in a quantitative way .",
    "our framework , which generates bibliometric statistics whose aggregate characteristics closely match those of real citation data ( figure  [ fig : calibration ] ) , is based on a number of assumptions and simplifications , yet it is open to include additional features of real citation dynamics .",
    "for instance , we could consider several research areas with different citation rates , which would in turn allow us to study field normalization for impact indicators .",
    "additionally , while we have intentionally excluded journals , review process , and the impact of publishing venue on paper success , different journals could be included to model important aspects for the dynamics of paper popularity , like high impact factor journals having a broader readership and attracting more citations for their articles .",
    "moving further , the social network of researchers plays an important role in real citation dynamics , and thus in principle we could consider the presence of both befriended and competing scientists , the structure of research collaborations  @xcite , and the feedback of author reputation on the dynamics of paper popularity  @xcite . a strong assumption of our model is the use of eq .",
    "( [ linkingp ] ) that determines the citation mechanism . indeed , while this formulation was shown to fit real data better than any other model proposed so far  @xcite , it can of course be improved .",
    "for instance , we could vary the sensitivity of citing papers to cited papers quality , _",
    "i.e. _ , make high fitness papers more likely to cite other good papers than low fitness papers do .",
    "besides making the model more realistic ( there is empirical evidence that highly cited papers do cite other highly cited papers more often than one would expect , in particular more often than the badly cited papers do  @xcite ) , such a modification could allow pagerank - like metrics to yield results superior to simple local metrics such as citation count and @xmath0-index .    despite these simplifications ,",
    "our analysis allowed us to quantitatively asses what impact indicators actually reflect .",
    "we found that the average citation score efficiently measures authors ability , whereas , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 indices and the simpler cumulative logarithmic citation count @xmath89 do capture joint ability and productivity of researchers .",
    "additionally , we provided several recommendations for a proper use of the normalized @xmath0-index in the identification of talented young scientists . while our results are only preliminary , and may become more robust by equipping the model with more realistic assumptions , we remark that the issue of studying what impact indicators do measure is of critical importance nowadays , as these metrics are currently so widely employed by selection committees that basically determine `` most things that matter : tenure or unemployment , a postdoctoral grant or none , success or failure ''  @xcite .",
    "however , impact indicators are `` usually well intentioned , not always well informed , often ill applied ''  @xcite . in other words , while these indicators have been designed to improve the system , their improper use is putting the system in danger  primarily by modifying the very aim of scientists from making discoveries to publishing as many papers and getting as many citations as possible . in this respect",
    ", simulation scenarios may ease the difficulties in determining what a given measurements of scientific impact reflects , without overlooking the fact that in any case impact indicators alone can not be used to judge individual scientists .",
