    "up to date the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson has evaded its direct detection .",
    "electroweak precision data collected at the cern large electron - positron collider ( lep ) , at the stanford linear collider ( slc ) and at the tevatron at fermilab predict a light sm higgs boson below approximately 200  . on the other hand ,",
    "the direct search at lep2 has excluded higgs bosons below 114  gev which leaves a relatively narrow window for the mass .",
    "a higgs boson in this mass range , often also referred to as intermediate - mass higgs boson , predominantly decays into bottom quarks and @xmath3 bosons depending whether the latter decay is kinematically allowed .",
    "a further decay channel which is of phenomenological interest is the one into gluons . at lowest order this process",
    "is mediated by a top quark loop  @xcite .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections are quite large and amount to roughly 70%  @xcite .",
    "about ten years ago the nnlo corrections have been computed in the limit of an infinitely heavy top quark mass  @xcite . since the corrections amount to approximately 20% they increased the reliability of the perturbative expansion of the decay rate",
    "this has been further substantiated by the recent evaluation of the nnnlo corrections  @xcite , again in the infinite top quark mass limit , which provides a contribution of about 2% .",
    "the calculations to nnlo and nnnlo are both based on an effective theory which results from the sm after integrating out the top quark .",
    "the effective lagrangian is constructed from operators with dimension five which is sufficient to obtain the leading term in the heavy - top expansion .",
    "the inclusion of higher - dimensional operators would lead to power - suppressed terms .",
    "however , the renormalization of the corresponding effective lagrangian is quite tedious . in this paper",
    "we follow a different approach and consider the higgs - boson propagator in the full sm .",
    "its imaginary part leads  with the help of the optical theorem  directly to the decay rate .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that at nnlo five - loop corrections to the higgs two - point function have to be considered since the lo result already requires a three - loop diagram where the coupling of the higgs boson to the gluons is mediated by two top quark triangles .",
    "they are connected by two gluon lines .",
    "the advantage of our method relies on the straightforward automatization using state - of - the - art techniques and program packages as we will show in section  [ sec::tecdet ] .",
    "an important feature of the higgs boson decay into gluons is its affinity to the production mechanism in the gluon fusion channel . for the latter",
    "the nnlo corrections are again only known within the framework of the effective theory  @xcite .",
    "the calculation performed in the present paper gives a first hint about the potential size of the terms which are suppressed by the top quark mass .",
    "let us finally mention that the corresponding nnlo corrections to the decay of the higgs boson into two photons have been obtained in ref .",
    "note that in this case a simple expansion of the higgs - photon - photon vertex diagrams is sufficient to obtain power - suppressed terms the heavy @xmath4-limit .",
    "thus only three- instead of five - loop diagrams have to be considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec::tecdet ] we present some details of our calculation and section  [ sec::res ] contains our analytical results and the discussion about the numerical implications .",
    "we conclude the paper with section  [ sec::concl ] .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , for the computation of the decay rate @xmath5 we consider the higgs boson self energy , @xmath6 , and apply the optical theorem which in our case reads @xmath7",
    "\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we do not consider the ( exclusive ) decay into light quarks only those diagrams contribute to @xmath8 where the higgs boson couples to the top quark .",
    "thus the lo result is obtained from the three - loop diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::diags](a ) ( and the one with crossed gluons ) .",
    "the nlo and nnlo results are obtained by dressing this diagram with additional gluons and ( light and heavy ) quark loops .",
    "sample diagrams can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig::diags](b)(e ) .",
    "it is clear that beyond lo next to gluons also light quarks can be produced . in particular , at nnlo also a final state @xmath9 with light quark flavours @xmath10 and @xmath11 is possible .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     it is interesting to note that around @xmath12  gev the nnlo curve shows a local maximum where the decay rate is independent of @xmath13 . for @xmath14  gev the nnlo corrections vanish ( crossing between dash - dotted and solid line ) which hints for a good convergence of perturbation theory .",
    "this is further supported by the smallness of the nnnlo corrections ( dotted ) which show a very flat @xmath13-dependence over the whole range considered in fig .",
    "[ fig::mu ] .",
    "in this paper the nnlo corrections to the gluonic decay width of the higgs boson in the intermediate mass range is considered . with the help of an automated asymptotic expansion three terms in the large-@xmath4-limit",
    "have been obtained .",
    "it is demonstrated that our result is equivalent to an exact calculation at least up to @xmath15 . for @xmath16  gev the nnlo term which changes by about 9% due to the new corrections induces a 1% correction to the total gluonic decay rate .",
    "the situation is different if the complete top quark mass dependence of the leading order result is factored out . in this case",
    "the power - suppressed corrections become smaller .",
    "this is in particular true for top quark masses in the @xmath17 scheme where for higgs boson masses up to @xmath18  gev the full result is given by the leading term in the large @xmath4-expansion .",
    "this observation has possible implications for the higgs boson production via gluon fusion where only the leading order term in @xmath19 is available . in case",
    "the expansion for @xmath20 shows a similar behaviour the uncertainty induced by the unknown power - suppressed terms is negligible .",
