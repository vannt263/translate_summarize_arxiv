    "the majority rule renormalization group transformation is formally defined by @xmath0 here @xmath1 are the spins in the original system and @xmath2 are the block spins ( or image spins ) .",

    "@xmath6 is the kernel for the majority rule transformation . if the lattice and block size are such that the number of spins in a block is odd , then this kernel only takes on the values 0 and 1 .",
    "the kernel is 1 if in every block a majority of the spins agree with the block spin , and 0 otherwise .",
    "if the number of spins in a block is even , then there can be a `` tie '' in a block .",
    "in such systems the kernel is zero if there is a block with a clear majority and the majority disagrees with the block spin .",

    "( [ eqa ] ) formally defines a new hamiltonian @xmath11 for the block spins .",
    "( [ eqa ] ) can not be used to directly define @xmath12 in the infinite volume limit .",
    "one must use ( [ eqa ] ) for finite volumes and then try to take the infinite volume limit .",
    "another approach , emphasized in @xcite , is to apply the majority rule transformation to infinite volume gibbs measures .",
    "the renormalized measure is always defined , but one must now deal with two problems .",
    "first , the original hamiltonian may have more than one infinite volume gibbs measure .",
    "second , the renormalized measure may not be the gibbs measure of any reasonable hamiltonian .",
    "van enter , fernandez and sokal @xcite used ideas of griffiths and pearce @xcite and israel @xcite to prove that at low temperatures the renormalized measure is non - gibbsian for majority rule for a variety of block sizes , the smallest being 7 by 7 .",
    "the idea behind the proof is to find a special block spin configuration such that when the system of original spins is conditioned on this block spin configuration , there is a phase transition . loosely speaking",
    ", the strong correlations in the constrained original spin system then prevent the renormalized measure from being quasilocal .    there",
    "now exists a large collection of examples in which the renormalized measure is not gibbsian .",
    "a review and extensive bibliography may be found in @xcite . in many of these examples , including the case of 2 by 2 majority rule considered here , the trouble is caused by block spin configurations ( like the checkerboard one ) that will never be seen at low temperature . insisting that the renormalized measure be quasilocal uniformly in the block spin configuration",
    "may be asking too much . by using a weaker definition of the renormalized hamiltonian it is often possible to prove a renormalized hamiltonian",
    "may be defined in cases where the renormalized measure is not uniformly quasilocal @xcite .    to show that the transformation is not defined for 2 by 2 blocks , we follow the method of @xcite closely .",
    "the special block spin configuration that they use for 7 by 7 blocks is the `` doubly alternating '' configuration .",
    "this configuration consists of 2 by 2 groups of block spins of the same sign which alternate , i.e. , for each such group of four block spins the four adjacent groups of four block spins have the opposite sign . with this block spin constraint",
    "the original spins have two ground states . in one ground state",
    "most of the spins are @xmath13 , but there are 10 by 10 islands of @xmath14 arranged so that the majority rule constraint is satisfied .",
    "the special block spin configuration we use is the alternating or checkboard configuration in which every pair of nearest neighbor block spins are not equal . for 2 by 2 blocks with this block spin configuration",
    "we will show that the original spins have four ground states - the four `` strip '' states .",
    "one of them is shown in figure 1  .",
    "given the methods of @xcite , the only nontrivial part of our proof is to show that these are indeed the ground states and a `` peierls condition '' is satisfied .",
    "we do this by showing that the hamiltonian with the majority rule constraint can be written as an `` @xmath15-potential '' @xcite . to verify that our rewritten form of the constrained hamiltonian is indeed an @xmath15-potential we enlist the help of a computer .",
    "our final result is theorem 4.5 of @xcite with `` 7 x 7 '' replaced by `` 2 x 2 '' . for the convenience of the reader",
    "we restate the theorem . in the following",
    ", @xmath16 denotes the probability measure on the block spins which is obtained from the gibbs measure @xmath17 for the originial spins and the transformation @xmath18 in the usual way @xcite .    * theorem 1 : * ( for 7 by 7 blocks this is theorem 4.5 of @xcite . ) for all @xmath5 sufficiently large , the following holds : let @xmath17 be any gibbs measure for the two - dimensional ising model with nearest neighbor coupling @xmath5 and zero magnetic field .",
    "let @xmath18 be the majority - rule transformation on 2 x 2 square blocks .",
    "then the measure @xmath16 is not consistent with any quasilocal specification . in particular , it is not the gibbs measure of any uniformly convergent interaction .",
    "next we turn to our second result . in a finite volume",
    "we can take the zero temperature limit of ( [ eqa ] ) to obtain @xmath19 ( in ( [ eqa ] ) the inverse temperature @xmath5 is hidden in @xmath4 , so in taking this limit we must divide @xmath20 by @xmath5 . )",
    "we can then ask if this zero temperature majority rule transformation has an infinite volume limit , i.e. , if @xmath12 has an infinite volume limit which belongs to some reasonable banach space of hamiltonians . if one looks at the argument which shows that the majority rule transformation is not defined at low temperature for 2 by 2 and 7 by 7 blocks , it is easy to adapt it to show that ( [ eqb ] ) does not have a nice infinite volume limit in this case . for the triangular lattice",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "we will prove that not only does ( [ eqb ] ) have an infinite volume limit , but the renormalized hamiltonian is a local function of the block spins .",
    "the precise result is as follows .",
    "a hamiltonian is said to be local if it contains only a finite number of terms up to translations . in the following we work with finite volumes which are unions of blocks and which admit periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this last condition means that the finite volume and translations of it tesselate the lattice .",
    "* theorem 2 : * for finite volumes @xmath21 which admit periodic boundary conditions , define @xmath22 by ( [ eqb ] ) where @xmath23 is the nearest neighbor ferromagnetic hamiltonian for the original spins in @xmath21 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there is a local translation invariant hamiltonian @xmath12 on the block spins such that for sufficiently large volumes @xmath21 , @xmath22 equals the restriction of @xmath12 to @xmath21 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "( the local renormalized hamiltonian is given in table 1 . )",
    "of course , this theorem does not prove anything about majority rule on the triangular lattice for low but nonzero temperatures .",
    "however , it does show that the argument used to prove the transformation is not defined for 7 by 7 and 2 by 2 blocks on the square lattice will not work for the triangular lattice .",
    "the theorem suggests the possibility that majority rule is actually defined for the triangular lattice at low temperatures , possibly for all temperatures .      consider the checkerboard block spin configuration ( @xcite calls this configuration the fully alternating configuration . )",
    "we will show that with the constraint imposed by this block spin configuration , the system of original spins has four periodic ground states .",
    "one of them is shown in figure 1  .",
    "the other three are obtained by rotating this one by 90 degrees and by applying a global spin flip to these two spin configurations .",
    "we will refer to these four states as the _ strip states_.      = 20 pt = 20 pt figure 1  : circled spins are block spins , uncircled spins are original spins .",
    "the block spins are in the checkerboard configuration , and the original spins are in one of the four ground states which we call `` strip states '' .",
    "a hamiltonian @xmath4 may be written in many ways as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is summed over finite subsets up to some fixed size and @xmath26 is a function of the spins in @xmath25 .",
    "such a decomposition is said to be an @xmath15-potential if there is a configuration @xmath1 such that for every @xmath25 @xmath27 in other words one can find a single configuration which simultaneously minimizes every term in the decomposition of the hamiltonian .",
    "* proposition 3 : * @xmath4 may be written as an @xmath15-potential .",
    "furthermore , the only configurations which simultaneously minimize every term in this representation of the hamiltonian are the four strip states .",
    "* proof : * we will take the original hamiltonian to be @xmath28 so that a pair of nearest neighbor spins that agree has energy 0 and a pair that disagrees has energy 1 . our representation of this hamiltonian that shows that it is an @xmath15-potential is rather complicated ,",
    "so we will motivate it by showing why a natural simpler representation is not an @xmath15-potential .",
    "divide the lattice into 4 by 4 squares so that each square contains 4 of the 2 by 2 blocks used by the majority rule .",

    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are always zero , and @xmath38 .",
    "figure 3  gives a configuration which gives a lower value for @xmath29 , and thus this decomposition of the hamiltonian is not an m - potential .        to modify the above decomposition of the hamiltonian to give an @xmath15-potential",
    ", we introduce four functions @xmath39 , each of which only depends on the spins in square @xmath33 .",
    "( @xmath40 stand for left , right , up and down . ) define @xmath41 then we have @xmath42 this equation holds for any choice of the functions @xmath39 .",
    "of course the hard part is finding a choice of these functions such that ( [ eqb ] ) is an @xmath15-potential . we will find a choice for which @xmath43 , and these lower bounds are all attained by the strip configurations .",
    "some explanation of the left , right , up , down terminology is in order .",
    "each of the functions @xmath39 is a function of the 16 spins in the 4 by 4 square .",
    "however , they depend on these 16 spins only through the value of @xmath29 and the four spins along one of the four edges of the square",
    ". left , right , up and down refer to which edge .",
    "unfortunately this causes some confusion when one considers @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in @xmath44 , @xmath33 is the left square and @xmath36 is the right square .",
    "now @xmath30 depends on the spins along the right edge of @xmath33 and the left edge of @xmath36 .",
    "so we subtract @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the definition of @xmath44 .",
    "we give the definition of @xmath46 , along with a bit of motivation .",
    "the definitions of the other three functions are trivially obtained by rotation .",
    "we denote the four sites on the right edge of square @xmath33 by 1,2,3,4 .",
    "( see figure 4  . ) in the strip states the four spins @xmath48 can be @xmath49 , @xmath50,@xmath51 , or @xmath52 . if @xmath53 and the four spins agree with one of these four configurations , then @xmath54 . if @xmath53 and the four spins do not agree with any of these four cases , then @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath38 , then @xmath54 , regardless of the values of @xmath56 . note that in a strip configuration , @xmath57 .",
    "the motivation for this part of the definition of @xmath46 is to make @xmath58 for those configurations which have @xmath53 . as an example , consider figure 3  ( b ) .",
    "this configuration has @xmath59 .",
    "but @xmath60 , so @xmath61 . if we completed the definition of @xmath46 by defining it to be zero whenever @xmath62 , we would find that @xmath44 can be negative .",
    "an example is shown in figure 5  .",
    "for the left square @xmath63 , and for the right square @xmath64 .",
    "obviously @xmath65 .",
    "but @xmath66 , so if @xmath46 were defined to be 0 , then @xmath67 would be negative . to fix this problem we need to make @xmath46 negative in some cases .",
    "of course we must do this in such a way that @xmath68 is still bounded below by 8 .",
    "we now complete the definition of @xmath46 . if @xmath69 we set @xmath70 if three or more of the spins at @xmath71 are different from the block spin of the block in which they sit .",
    "otherwise , @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath46 is still zero in all four strip states .",
    "we want to show that @xmath72 this is easily done on a computer . with the majority rule constraint ,",
    "the number of allowable configurations on a 2 by 2 block is 11 .",
    "so for a 4 by 4 block it is @xmath73 .",
    "this is small enough that we can verify @xmath74 by simply computing every case .",
    "the number of cases to be checked for the second and third inequalities is @xmath75 .",
    "luckily , they do not all need to be checked . since @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 if @xmath78 .",
    "this reduces the number of cases that must be explicitly computed to something managable .",
    "the result of the computer program is that ( [ eqc ] ) is indeed true .",
    "thus we have succeeded in writing the hamiltonian as an @xmath15-potential .",
    "finally , we need to determine the ground states .",
    "the four strip states simultaneously minimize each of @xmath68 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we will show that these are the only configurations that do this .",
    "we start by asking what configurations on a square have @xmath79 . according to the computer there are 76 such configurations , including the 4 strip states .",
    "we now consider a square @xmath33 and the four squares adjacent to it .",
    "( we label them as follows : @xmath80up , @xmath81right , @xmath82down , @xmath83 left . )",
    "we ask for what configurations on square @xmath33 is it possible to find configurations on square @xmath84 such that @xmath85 again , we enlist the help of the computer .",
    "the answer is that there are only four such configurations on square @xmath33 , the four strip states .",
    "thus in a ground state every 4 by 4 square is one of the strip states . in the strip states @xmath57 , so ( [ eqzz ] ) implies @xmath86 .",
    "this implies that in a ground state we have the same strip state in every 4 by 4 square .",
    "this completes the proof of proposition 3 .",
    "width5pt    let @xmath87 denote a checkerboard block spin configuration .",
    "we have shown that when the hamiltonian @xmath23 is restricted to @xmath1 with @xmath88 , then @xmath23 is an @xmath15-potential with four ground states .",
    "it follows from a theorem of holsztynski and slawny @xcite that this restricted @xmath4 satisfies the sort of peierls condition that one needs to carry out pirogov - sinai theory .",
    "pirogov - sinai theory implies that the original spin system conditioned on the checkerboard block spin configuration will have four gibbs states at low temperature that are small perturbations of the four ground states .",
    "the conditioned system we must consider is not simply given by restricting @xmath23 to the configurations with @xmath88 . we must also add @xmath89 to the hamiltonian . the ising hamiltonian comes with a factor of @xmath5 , so @xmath89 is a small perturbation which can be handled by the pirogov - sinai theory .",
    "( pirogov - sinai theory is needed here rather than just a simple peierls argument because the rotational symmetry of the lattice is being broken as well as the global spin flip symmetry .",
    "an introduction to pirogov - sinai theory in the context in which we need it may be found in appendix b of @xcite .",

    "= 20 pt = 20 pt figure 6  : the special block spin configuration that picks out one of the pure phases for the original spin system conditioned on the checkerboard block spin configuration .",
    "note that only block spins are shown .",
    "we leave it to the reader to draw in the strip state that is picked out .",
    "the four block spins that are `` unfixed '' are indicated by circles .",
    "pirogov - sinai theory establishes the phase transition that is responsible for the renormalized measure being non - gibbsian .",
    "however , we are not finished . to apply the argument of @xcite",
    ", we must show that one of the four pure phases may be selected by a suitable choice of boundary conditions .",
    "this would be easy if we were free to choose the boundary condition for the original spins .",
    "unfortunately , we must show that this pure phase can be selected by a choice of boundary condition for the block spins .",
    "the special block spin configuration we use to select a pure phase is shown in figure 6  .",
    "note that it is based on a finite volume in the shape of a parallelogram rather than a square .",
    "the two horizontal boundaries of the parallelogram favor one of the four strip states .",
    "the two boundaries at a 45 degree angle with respect to the lattice directions are neutral in the sense that each of the four strip states has the same boundary energy where it hits these boundaries . to prove that this block spin configuration does indeed pick out one strip state ,",
    "we show that the hamiltonian can be written as an m - potential with a unique ground state .",
    "the strategy is the same as before , but we must modify the definition of the functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the vicinity of the boundary .",
    "the details are provided in the appendix .",
    "finally , we need to show that by changing the boundary condition for the block spins , we can change the distribution of the block spins near the origin . this then implies that the renormalized measure can not be quasilocal , i.e. , is not consistent with any quasilocal specification . to do this we consider four block spins arranged in a square located near the origin . in the language of @xcite",
    "we `` unfix '' these four block spins . the four block spins we unfix are indicated in figure 6  by circles . inside the four blocks",
    "the original spins will all be @xmath13 with probability @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 denote the set containing the sites of the four block spins that were unfixed .",

    "@xmath97 denotes the conditional expectation of @xmath94 where we condition on the block spins not in @xmath93 .",
    "this is a function of the block spins , so we write it as @xmath98 .",
    "( of course , it actually only depends on @xmath99 with @xmath100 . ) let @xmath101 be the set of block spin configurations which agree with the block spin configuration shown in figure 6  and are arbitrary outside of the region shown in the figure .",
    "this is an open set in the product topology .",
    "we have shown that @xmath102    now suppose that we modify 6  as follows .",
    "we increase the height of the parallelogram by two block spins by moving each of the horizontal sides of the parallelogram by one block spin .",
    "the border of the parallelogram still consists of plus block spins , and the interior is the same checkerboard configuration as in figure 6  .",
    "but now we will get the pure phase which is the global spin flip of the pure phase we had before .",
    "hence the four block spins in @xmath93 will be @xmath14 with probability @xmath92 .",
    "so @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the set of block spin configurations which agree with this modified version of figure @xmath105 , and are arbitrary outside of the parallelogram .",
    "the above estimates are uniform in the size of the parallelogram , so this proves that the conditional distribution of the four block spins we unfixed is essentially discontinuous and so can not come from a quasilocal specification .    our proof that the majority rule transformation is not defined at low temperature for 2 by 2 blocks is driven by the phase transition that takes place for the system of original spins with the constraint given by the checkboard block spin configuration .",
    "our proof requires that the temperature be very low .",
    "however , one might expect that the transformation will not be defined for all temperatures below the critical temperature of this constrained system .",

    "we need only find one ground state .",
    "we will give an algorithm for constructing one ground state .",

    "given the values the block spins for these 12 blocks , our algorithm determines the values of the original spins which are in the three inner blocks .",
    "the 9 nearest neighbor bonds shown in the figure are chosen so that when they are translated by all translations commensurate with the block spin lattice , we get every bond in the original lattice exactly once .",
    "thus the ground state energy @xmath12 is obtained by computing the energy of these 9 bonds and then summing over translations .",
    "obviously the support of a term in @xmath11 must be a subset of the block spins shown in figure 8  , or a translation of this set .",
    "in fact , we find that the only terms that actually appear in @xmath11 are those with support contained in some set of 7 block spins arranged in a hexagon along with the block at the center of the hexagon .",
    "for example , the seven block spins shown in figure 7  are such a hexagonal set .        while the original triangular lattice is invariant under rotations by a multiple of 60 degrees , the blocking partially breaks this symmetry and so @xmath11",
    "need only be invariant under rotations by multiples of 120 degrees .",
    "in addition to this rotational symmetry , the blocked lattice is also invariant under some reflections . taking these symmetries into account",
    ", @xmath11 has 15 different terms .",
    "they are given in table 1 .",
    "only one element from each symmetry class is given in the table .",
    "the arguments we have given apply in any finite volume with periodic boundary conditions provided the volume is not so small that the sorts of regions we have been considering wrap back around on themselves .",
    "thus we have proved theorem 2 .                in this appendix",
    "we consider the system of original spins with the constraint imposed by the block spin configuration shown in figure 6  from section two .",
    "we want to show that the hamiltonian is an @xmath15-potential and has a unique ground state in the interior of the parallelogram .",
    "the strategy is the same as in section two .",
    "the only difference is in the definition of the functions @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "these functions now depend on where the square @xmath33 is in relation to the parallelogram in figure 6  .",
    "we divide the squares into five types , labelled 1 to 5 , according to where the square is .",
    "see figure 6  .",
    "the definitions of the functions are a bit involved .",
    "we will not attempt to motivate them ; they were found mainly with trial and error and a little intuition .",
    "we should emphasize that they are by no means unique .    to define the functions @xmath39",
    ", we introduce a little notation .",
    "recall that each of these functions is a function of a four by four square in the original lattice . for function @xmath90 or @xmath91 , the `` four boundary spins",
    "'' will refer to the four spins along the left , right , upper or lower edge of the square , respectively .",
    "each original spin belongs to a two by two majority rule block .",
    "we will refer of the block spin of that two by two block as the block spin associated to the original spin .",
    "now let @xmath146 be the number of the four boundary spins that are not equal to their associated block spin .",
    "let @xmath147 be the number of the four boundary spins that are equal to @xmath14 . finally we define a variable @xmath148 that takes on the values true and false .",
    "@xmath148 is true if the four boundary spins agree with the four boundary spins in some strip configuration , i.e. , they must be one of @xmath49 , @xmath50,@xmath51 , or @xmath52 .",
    "if square @xmath33 is of type @xmath149 , then the functions @xmath39 are all defined as follows . if @xmath150 and @xmath148 is not true , then the value is @xmath13 . if @xmath69 and @xmath151 , then the value is @xmath14 .",
    "otherwise the value is @xmath152 .    now consider a square @xmath33 is of type @xmath153 near the left boundary .",
    "the functions @xmath46 and @xmath91 are defined as they were for type @xmath149 squares .",
    "the functions @xmath154 and @xmath145 are defined as follows . if @xmath150 and @xmath155 , then the value is @xmath13 . if @xmath69 and @xmath151 then the value is @xmath14 .",
    "otherwise the value is @xmath152 .",
    "the definitions for a type @xmath153 square near the right boundary are obtained in the obvious way by symmetry considerations .    for a square @xmath33 of type @xmath156 located near the left boundary",
    "the definitions are as follows .",
    "@xmath154 and @xmath145 equal @xmath147 when @xmath157 and equal @xmath156 when @xmath158 .",
    "the definition of @xmath46 and @xmath91 is a bit more complicated when @xmath33 is of type @xmath156 . if @xmath159 and @xmath148 is not true , then their value is @xmath13 . if @xmath160 and @xmath151 , then their value is @xmath14 .",
    "the definitions for a type @xmath156 square near the right boundary are obtained in the obvious way by symmetry considerations .    if square @xmath33 is of type @xmath161 and near the left boundary , then @xmath46 and @xmath91 equal @xmath162 when @xmath163 and equal @xmath164 when @xmath165 .",
    "the functions @xmath166 are identically zero when @xmath33 is of type @xmath161 .",
    "again , symmetry determines the definitions when the square is near the right boundary .",
    "if square @xmath33 is of type @xmath167 and near the top boundary , then @xmath91 equals @xmath14 when @xmath168 and equals @xmath152 otherwise .",
    "the functions @xmath90 are identically zero .",
    "if square @xmath33 is of type @xmath167 and near the bottom boundary , then @xmath145 equals @xmath14 when @xmath168 and equals @xmath152 otherwise .",
    "the functions @xmath144 are identically zero .    in the strip state selected by the block spin configuration in figure 6",
    ", we have @xmath169 for @xmath33 of type @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "we also have @xmath171 and @xmath57 in this strip state except for the following cases .",
    "if @xmath33 is type 4 and @xmath36 is type @xmath156 and @xmath33 is immediately left of @xmath36 , then @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "thus in the strip state shown , @xmath174 for @xmath33 of type @xmath170 , respectively , and @xmath175 . to prove that our decomposition of the hamiltonian is an @xmath15-potential we must show that these values are in fact the minimum of each of these functions . as in section two ,",
    "this is easily done on the computer .",
    "finally we ask what are the ground states of the hamiltonian . by the results of section two , in the interior of the parallelogram the configuration must be in one of the four strip states .",
    "now consider the top horizontal edge of the parallelogram .",
    "for @xmath36 of type 5 we have @xmath176 , so the original spins in the 4 by 4 squares of type 5 must all be @xmath13 .",
    "now let @xmath33 be a type 1 square just below a type 1 square @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath38 and so @xmath177 . we also have @xmath178 , so @xmath179 .",
    "but @xmath180 , so @xmath181 .",
    "since the spins in square @xmath36 are all @xmath13 , it follows that a particular strip state is picked out for square @xmath33 .",
    "the same argument applies to the bottom edge of the parallelogram .",
    "the height of the parallelogram is chosen so that the strip state picked out by the top edge is the same as the one picked out by the bottom edge .",
    "we have not shown that in a ground state the configuration must look like figure 6  along the edges of the parallelogram at 45 degrees to the lattice directions .",
    "in fact , it need not .",
    "there are ways to modify figure 6  near these two edges that do not raise the energy .",
    "what we have shown is that any such modification can not lower the energy , and away from these two edges the ground state must be the strip state picked out by the horizontal edges of the parallelogram .",
