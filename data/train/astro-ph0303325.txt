    "our understanding of external galaxies , which are milestones in the cosmological evolution , relies on the ability of gauging their distances , ages , and chemical compositions .",
    "surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) are recognized as a powerful tool for providing accurate answers to all these challenges ( tonry , ajhar & luppino 1990 : tal90 ; buzzoni 1993 : b93 ; worthey 1993 : w93 ; brocato , capaccioli & condelli 1998 ; blakeslee , ajhar & tonry 1999 ; liu , charlot & graham 2000 : lcg00 ; blakeslee , vazdekis & ajhar 2001 : bva01 ) .",
    "since the first attempt of using the sbf in galaxies to estimate cosmic distances ( tonry & schneider 1988 : ts88 ) , a major observational effort has been made to improve the accuracy of the method ( tal90 ; luppino & tonry 1993 ; lorenz et al .",
    "1993 ; tonry et al . 1997 : tbad97 ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the typical uncertainties on the distances derived via the sbf are of the order of 10% or less ( mei , quinn & silva 2001 )",
    ". moreover , sbf work well in a wide range of distances , from the local group objects out to galaxy clusters such as virgo , fornax , and even coma .",
    "recently jensen et al . ( 2001 ) succeeded in reaching galaxies at 150 mpc ( @xmath10 ) using near - infrared ( nir ) hst data .",
    "the largest sbf database available so far is that of tonry & collaborators ( tonry et al .",
    "2001 : t01 , and references therein ) .",
    "they measured the @xmath8-band sbf of nearly 300 galaxies , and were able to calibrate empirically the absolute sbf amplitude in this same band with reference to cepheids - derived distances .",
    "the calibrations in other bands have been provided : by bva01 in @xmath6-band in the @xmath9-band by liu , graham & charlot ( 2002 : lgc02 ) , and in the @xmath11-band by jensen et al .",

    "( 2001 ) calibrated the @xmath7-band sbf absolute magnutide versus the galaxy @xmath12 color .",
    "this paper provides a new approach to derive sbf for simple stellar populations ( ssps , see renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) .",
    "our first goal is to revise the theoretical calibrations of absolute magnitudes of the optical and nir sbf .",
    "the reason is that empirical calibrations rest on some other indicators , thus confining sbf to the role of at least secondary distance indicators ( sbf errors sum up to the uncertainties of the primary distance indicators ) .",
    "such a limitation may be removed by theoretical sbf models which , by providing _",
    "absolute galaxy sbf magnitude _ versus _ integrated color _",
    "relations for several different filters , set the sbf method into the class of _ primary distance indicators_. of course one needs a high degree of reliability for the adopted theoretical framework .",
    "a second goal is to probe the capability of our sbf models in analyzing the stellar content of star clusters and galaxies as a complementary tool to the _ classical _ method based on integrated magnitudes and colors .",
    "unfortunately , disentangling the information on the main physical quantities which define the dominant stellar populations , the formation , and the evolution processes in elliptical and spiral galaxies from their integrated broad - band colors and spectral features still remains an intriguing problem ( brocato et al .",
    "1990 ; weiss , peletier & matteucci 1995 ; bressan , chiosi & tantalo 1996 ; kobayashi & arimoto 1999 ; trager et al . 2000 : tfwg00 ) .",
    "for instance , even in the simple case of elliptical galaxies , age works in masking possible metallicity effects ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ; worthey 1994 ) . since sbf are generated by the poissonian fluctuations of the stellar counts in each pixel of a galaxy image , they have a well understood physical origin ( dictated by the properties of the stellar population where they originate from ) .",
    "the amplitude of these fluctuations is determined by the age , chemical composition , and distribution of the evolving stars in the proper evolutionary phases .",
    "thus , theoretical sbf colors and magnitudes are expected to provide a diagnostic of the stellar content of galaxies , useful in decoupling age from metallicity ( lcg00 , bva01 ) .",
    "so far , only a handful of theoretical works on the sbf modeling are available ( w93 ; b93 ; lcg00 ; bva01 ; mei , quinn & silva 2001 ) . in spite of this impressive results , still models based on different ingredients ( stellar evolutionary tracks , temperature - color transformations ) and detailed assumptions ( hb morphology , agb evolution , mass loss , etc . )",
    "are needed in order to compare the various theoretical expectations and thus improve the reliability of the theoretical framework .",
    "a lightening example of the present situation is offered by fig .",
    "5 of lgc02 , clearly showing that the inferred ages and metallicities depend on the choice of models .",
    "the presentation of our work is organized as follows .",
    "the basis of the model is described in section 2 , where we also present absolute magnitudes and colors for the optical and nir ground - based and hst filters under different assumptions on the chemical composition and the age .",
    "section 3 reports on a comparison between our sbf predictions and those by other authors .",
    "the effects of the initial mass function ( imf ) and the contribution of stars in late evolutionary phases are explored in section 4 , together with a discussion on the impact of using different color - temperature libraries . after testing our sbf models as distance indicators on galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) and galaxies , in section 5",
    "they are applied to derive population parameters of some galaxies .",
    "theoretical calibrations are presented in section 6 .",
    "the main results are summarized in section 7 .",
    "our sbf model is based on the stellar population synthesis code described and tested observationally in brocato et al .",
    "( 1999 ; 2000 : bcpr00 ) .",
    "this code is optimized to reproduce both the observed distribution of stars in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and the integrated properties ( color and spectral indices , energy distribution , etc . ) of ggcs and galaxies . here",
    "we report the main ingredients used in the present version of the code , referring to the quoted papers for details on the theoretical background .",
    "all the computations refer to simple stellar populations , i.e. single - burst stellar systems with homogeneous chemical composition , and an imf to be randomly populated by our model machinery ( appendix a ) .",
    "those models computed by assuming a bimodal scalo - like imf in the mass range @xmath13 @xmath14 will be called * reference models * in the forthcoming .",
    "the database of stellar evolutionary tracks is from the teramo - pisa - roma group , based on the evolutionary stellar code franec ( cassisi et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) . here",
    "we include tracks with metallicity ranging from @xmath15 to super - solar metallicity @xmath16 ( castellani , chieffi & pulone 1991 ; castellani , chieffi & straniero 1992 ; bono et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "these sets of tracks cover all of the major evolutionary phases : main sequence ( ms ) , sub - giant branch ( sgb ) , red giant branch ( rgb ) , he - burning phase ( horizontal branch , hb ) , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "the latest stages , which are crucial for sbf calculations , have been treated with special care ; they extend to post - agb ( pagb ) and white dwarf ( wd ) sequences when needed .    in each reference model ,",
    "mass loss along the rgb and agb is taken into account following the prescriptions by reimers ( 1975 ) .",
    "in particular , along the rgb we adopt @xmath17 , which is able to reproduce the typical hb stars distributions and the integrated colors in globular clusters ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ; bcpr00 ) .",
    "a slightly higher value is taken for stars in the upper part of the agb ( @xmath18 , see paragraph 4.2.2 ) , which reproduces the observed amount of mass loss of very bright stars ( le bertre et al .",
    "2001 ) .",

    "for @xmath55 the least sensitive band is @xmath8 ; this means that @xmath56 is an excellent distance indicator for metal poor old stellar systems . at higher metallicities ( @xmath57 )",
    "the slope of the relation @xmath30 versus @xmath58 increases for all the sbf amplitudes and is similar for all bands ( @xmath59 ) but for @xmath4 . in general , @xmath60 has a quite different behavior in the whole range of metallicity , varying of @xmath61 due to the strong decrease of the @xmath4 mean luminosity of the brightest stars in the population as the metallicity increases ( fig .",

    "although ruling out @xmath60 as a reliable distance indicator , this high sensitivity makes it an excellent population tracer .",
    "unfortunately , no sbf measurements are available in the @xmath4 filter so far . the predicted small variations of @xmath62 bands at @xmath57 , coupled with high luminosity , support the increasing number of sbf measurements in these bands .",
    "the sbf amplitudes computed for the hst filters ( fig .  [ fig3]b ) show a behavior quite similar to the corresponding ground - based filters .",
    "the next step is to understand the effects of variations in the age of the stellar population on the sbf amplitudes .",

    "[ fig4 ] for both a metal - rich ( @xmath34 ) , and a metal - poor ( @xmath2 ) stellar system .",

    "@xmath62 bands are more sensitive ; sbf amplitudes increase by about @xmath65 from 5 to @xmath50 , in agreement with bva01 and lcg00 . however , for stellar populations with age in the range under consideration , @xmath62 sbf are strictly dependent on the adopted treatment of the brightest evolutionary phases ( thermal pulses , mass loss processes , etc . ) , as we will show in section 4.2 .",
    "let us finally remark that the sbf amplitudes for old stellar populations are much more sensitive to metallicity changes than to age , particularly at optical wavelengths .",
    "a similar conclusion , even with slightly different absolute sbf values , has been reached by other authors ( b93 ; lcg00 ; bva01 ) , who adopt different approaches and ingredients to derive population synthesis models . in this sense",
    "this result may be regarded as theoretically well established , i.e. it does not depend on the adopted stellar population models .",
    "we compare our work with the models by bva01 and lgc02 . since the grids of ages and metallicities do not match , for the comparison we select the values as similar as possible .",
    "we restrict the discussion to populations of fixed age ( @xmath66 ) , and to @xmath67 , @xmath11 photometric bands .",
    "[ fig5 ] plots the sbf predictions versus the @xmath68 ( _ right panel _ ) and @xmath69 $ ] ( _ left panel _ ) for single - burst stellar population models .    in spite of the very different theoretical framework , the general trends of the sbf amplitudes versus both metallicity and the integrated @xmath68 color are the same for all authors .",
    "however , for metallicity higher than solar , bva01 and lgc02 predict fainter sbf amplitudes in @xmath6 and @xmath8 bands ( up to @xmath70 ) and a similar , but less relevant , difference appears in the @xmath11-band .",
    "the reasons for such a discrepancy are expected to be in the basic ingredients and in the transformation tables .",
    "our models are based on a completely different evolutionary framework compared to bva01 and lcg00 , whose models rely on the padua stellar evolution database , although they use two different compilations of isochrones ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 , and girardi et al .",
    "2000 respectively ) , and different prescriptions for the agb stars .",
    "furthermore , we adopt a different approach to populate the brightest evolutionary phases ( hb , agb , thermal pulses ) as we shall show in the following sections . for an extensive discussion on the impact of evolutionary tracks and transformations tables on sbf expectations , the reader may refer to lcg00 and to our section 4.3 .",
    "let us remark that there is a substantial difference in the meaning of the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] : @xmath69 $ ] is an input parameter for all the models , so it is directly comparable , while the @xmath68 color is an output of each code , then it depends on the adopted evolutionary tracks , on the procedure in populating the isochrones , and so on .",
    "obviously , it may vary from model to model even for the same input parameters .",
    "starting from the reference models , in this section we investigate the sensitivity of sbf to imf , late evolutionary phases , and color - temperatures relations .",
    "usually the mass spectrum of a stellar population is described by the simple power law proposed by salpeter ( 1955 ) or by the bimodal ( or more ) function of scalo ( 1986 and thereafter ) .",
    "indeed , a crude extrapolation of the salpeter law to masses @xmath71 seems to fail , while the flattening and even possible declining behavior of the scalo imf appears more appropriate . for these reasons , in our reference calculations we have adopted a scalo - like imf .",
    "nevertheless the slope of this function at the lowest masses still remains very uncertain ( reid 1998 ) . in this section",
    "we evaluate the contribution to the sbf by the lowest mass stars , and what happens under significant changes in the slope of the imf .",
    "two different numerical experiments are performed on an old solar - metallicity ssp ( @xmath72 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) :    @xmath73 sbf amplitudes are computed for a set of models obtained by adopting an imf starting from different low mass limits , namely @xmath74=0.85 , 0.6 , 0.4 , and 0.1 @xmath14 , by keeping constant the number of rgb stars ( actually @xmath75 ) . for all these simulations we adopt a salpeter - like slope ( @xmath76 ) in order to enhance the contribution of very low mass stars ( table  2 ) .",
    "the table shows that the sbf amplitudes increase with the mass limit @xmath74 , the differences being fairly negligible or small in all cases but in the interval @xmath77 , whose upper limit is of the order of our turn - off mass ( @xmath78 , in the model quoted here @xmath79 ) . as a matter of fact , the ignorance of the upper part of the ms ( @xmath80 ) leads to underestimate the total luminosity of the population , which is obviously relevant in computing sbf because it represents the denominator of eq .  1 .",
    "on the contrary , to add ms stars with @xmath81 causes small variations of the sbf , since the total luminosity of the stellar population does not change significantly . note that this is true even though stars with @xmath82 represent nearly 90% of the total number of stars in the population . in conclusion ,",
    "no matter how ( reasonable ways ) the mass spectrum at @xmath81 is chosen , its contribution to sbf will not exceed @xmath83 in the most sensitive band @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath84 the effect on the sbf values due to the imf slope is explored by varying the exponent of the power law ( @xmath85=0.35 , 1.35 , and 2.35 ) for masses @xmath86 and assuming a flat distribution for masses @xmath87 ( table  3 ) .",
    "not surprisingly the variations are rather small ( @xmath88 ) ; @xmath85 affects mainly the number of the ms stars , which in turn affect only slightly the predicted sbf amplitudes , as previously shown . however , an increased / decreased number of post - ms stars is foreseen if the exponent has a lower / larger value than the salpeter s one . since the fluctuation rests mainly on the rgb stars",
    ", this explains why sbf brighten with decreasing imf exponents , and viceversa .",
    "we conclude that variations on the imf slope and/or the contribution of low mass stars to the sbf amplitude , _ although not negligible _ , play a secondary role with respect to the quantities ( and assumptions ) affecting the post - ms evolution , as for example the chemical composition and age of the populations .",
    "the result obtained with our new and fully independent code strengthens what originally found by w93 , and recently confirmed by other authors as well ( e.g. , bva01 ) .",
    "as just recalled , the sbf signal is very sensitive to the properties of the most luminous stars of the stellar population , as it is the ratio of the second to the first moment of the stellar luminosity function .",
    "this requires the ssp models to reach a high level of accuracy in reproducing the post - ms evolution .",
    "therefore , one of the aims in optimizing our code has been to fine - tune the stellar counts during the latest and fastest phases experienced by low mass stars along their evolution ( see also bcpr00 ) .    below we discuss the expected sbf sensitivity to the very bright stars in post - ms evolutionary phases : hb morphology , thermal pulses ( tp ) , and pagb phases .      as well known , the main parameter regulating the hb morphology of a generic stellar population is the metallicity ( lee , demarque & zinn 1987 ) .",
    "if one considers just the effect of @xmath58 , the expected hb morphology is that of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : _ blue _ or _ intermediate _ for @xmath890.001 , _ red _ when @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the distribution in color of low mass stars during the central he - burning stage is expected to play a major role in predicting @xmath91 sbf ( see also w93 ) .",
    "this is particularly true for high metallicities since the hb stars become brighter than the rgb tip ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "although we shall not discuss the nature of the second parameter ( freeman & norris 1981 ) , our models take into account that the metallicity is not the only quantity which can affect the hb morphology . here , we adopt the hb morphology as directly produced by metallicity and by mass loss along the rgb ( i.e. we use the mass loss to simulate the effect of the second parameter whatever its real nature is ) . along the same vein , one may recall that mass loss during the rgb evolution controls the actual total mass of the hb star and then affects its location in the cmd ( rood 1973 ) . moving from low to high values of mass loss , the total mass of the hb stars decreases ; this fact implies , on average , higher temperatures and bluer colors . on the observational side ,",
    "there are indications of mass loss enhancement for increasing values of metallicity ( e.g. kudritzki , pauldrach & puls 1987 ) .    on this basis",
    ", we have investigated the importance of hb morphology on sbf by simulating different amounts of mass - loss along the rgb , i.e. we have changed @xmath92 in the reimers formula ( @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ) in computing a set of ssp models with given metallicity ( @xmath95 , and @xmath3 ) and age ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "table 4 summarizes the sbf values for all ground - based filters .",
    "the effects on @xmath96 bands sbf amplitudes are shown in fig .",
    "the growth in luminosity of @xmath4-band sbf and the constancy of the other optical bands confirms the above expectation .",
    "we note that the effect is more pronounced for @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . for this metallicity ,",
    "an enhancement of the mass loss on the rgb reduces the mass of the `` forthcoming '' hb stars by a quantity large enough to populate the blue side of the hb .",
    "the larger is the mass loss , the larger is the number of blue hb stars and , consequently , the larger is the @xmath4-band sbf amplitude . for higher metallicity systems ,",
    "variations are still present but of smaller amplitude ( @xmath99 ) just because the mass of the rgb stars for the selected age is so large that only red hb stars are produced even for the largest mass loss rates considered here .    from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] it is also apparent the opposite behavior shown by @xmath100 which depends on the fact that , as @xmath92 increases , the number of bright stars evolving on the agb is smaller .",
    "let us note here that an age of @xmath101 @xmath22 is selected because models with younger ages provide a red clumpy hb morphology independently of any reasonable value of the @xmath92 parameter .",
    "this is because , by decreasing the age , the hb is populated by stars of increasing mass , which spend their he - burning phase at the red portion of the hb .",
    "thus , no changes are expected on sbf .",
    "an unlikely value of @xmath102 along the rgb phase would be needed to force the models to a blue hb morphology .",
    "however , this extremely high mass loss on the rgb would imply a similar ( or larger ) efficiency along the agb .",
    "this means that the stars are expected to lose their h - envelope , and quickly move to the wd cooling sequence during the very early part of the agb ascension .",
    "such an improbable scenario leads to sbf which are found to be fainter , particularly for the redder color ( up to @xmath103 for the @xmath9-band ) , when compared to models with more realistic assumption on the rgb mass loss efficiency .",
    "the present results , even if they do not provide an exhaustive picture of the problem , give quantitative indications on the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands sbf variations as a function of the hb morphology .",
    "the effect of @xmath92 on sbf was also explored by b93 , but his synthetic models have always a red clumpy hb morphology for populations with @xmath104 .    we conclude that changes in the hb morphology , as induced by reasonable assumptions on the mass loss along the rgb , have a negligible impact on sbf , if one considers filters redder than @xmath5 .",
    "mass loss strongly affects the he - exhaustion stages too , and determines different scenarios for the evolution of stars leaving the hb , either to the tp phase or rapidly to a pagb condition .",
    "according to the observations ( e.g. alard et al . 2001 ) , mass loss becomes more and more efficient as the star climbs the agb , till the ejection of the stellar envelope during the last superwind stages ( renzini 1981 ) .    to extend our he - burning evolutionary tracks to the tp phase , we follow the prescriptions by groenewegen & de jong ( 1993 ) as in a previous paper ( bcpr00 ) . as cited above ,",
    "our reference models simulate the mass loss process along the agb by adopting an enhanced reimers coefficient @xmath92 ( namely @xmath18 ) . the corresponding mass lost by stars",
    "is in the range from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , in fair agreement with observations of agb stars ( e.g. le bertre et al . 2001 ) .",
    "if the age of the population is fixed , an increase of the mass loss rate reflects into a decreasing of the number of very bright agb stars just because their h - rich envelopes become quickly so thin that the stars leave the agb phase .",
    "according to this simple view , an increase of the mass loss rate induces a corresponding decrease of the foreseen luminosity of the agb tip .",
    "this occurrence has to affect sbf amplitudes . to investigate such an issue quantitatively , we computed a series of sbf models by changing @xmath107 from 0.4 to 3.2 .",
    "the results in the johnson - cousins filters are reported in table  5 for solar metallicity and the labeled ages .",
    "dealing with agb stars , the effect is more remarkable in the redder bands .",
    "[ fig7 ] illustrates the sbf dependence on @xmath107 for models with different ages and solar chemical composition in the @xmath108 filters .",
    "such a dependence provides the unique opportunity of using the sbf to constraint evolutionary parameters during the late stage of the agb and tp phase .",
    "in particular , we calibrate the mass loss efficiency along the agb .",
    "each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the @xmath8-band sbf predictions computed with a specific value of @xmath107 ( 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.6 , 3.2 ) .",
    "to perform this calibration we use the mean empirical relations @xmath56 versus @xmath68 as derived from observations of galaxies and ggcs . the inclined solid line in the range @xmath109 represents the relation derived by t01 .",
    "according to t01 the slope of this relation is quite well established , whereas the zero point is more uncertain with a rms scatter as large as @xmath83 ( see table 4 in tbad97 ) .",
    "however , the true indetermination of the zero point is expected to be of the order of @xmath110 , since one has to include the uncertainties in the cepheid zero point ( mould et al .",
    "2000 , freedman et al . 2001 ) and in the lmc distance modulus ( e.g. benedict et al .",
    "the horizontal solid line in the range @xmath111 refers to the observed locus of ggcs ( ajhar & tonry 1994 : at94 ) , after a recalibration according to bva01 prescriptions ( eq .  5 in bva01 ) . in this case",
    "the quoted rms scatter is @xmath112 .",
    "in addition , the zero point of the horizontal line has an indetermination of at least @xmath113 arising from the uncertainty of the ggcs distances .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows that the two extreme values of the @xmath107 do not match the observed sbf .",
    "in fact @xmath114 provides too bright sbf amplitudes at all metallicities but @xmath115 ; on the contrary , the models with @xmath116 appear definitively fainter than observations .",
    "the intermediate cases are more interesting : both the @xmath107 values fairly reproduce the sbf data . however , the horizontal line representing the ggcs measurements is fitted by sbf simulations of the proper metallicity values but of quite different ages .",
    "the assumption of @xmath117 leads to a remarkable fit with models of @xmath118 , while @xmath119 requires an age of the order of @xmath120 .",
    "since our ssp models reproduce the cmds and integrated properties of ggcs when an age of @xmath121 is assumed ( bcpr00 ) , we find that @xmath117 simulates the mass loss process on agb in such a way that the resulting distribution of stars on the agb is able to reproduce at the same time the sbf measurements in galaxies and in ggcs .    in spite of the large uncertainties on the zero points , this result represents a relevant constraint for stellar evolution models of agb stars .",
    "even if the exact values of @xmath107 depend on the assumed theoretical framework , the method outlined here remains a new and powerful tool to improve our knowledge on the details of the evolution of agb stars .",
    "the theory predicts a small number of pagb stars ( renzini 1998 , bcpr00 ) which , however , increases with the total number of stars .",

    "since sbf are sensitive to the most luminous stars , as first approximation , we simulate only the most luminous pagb , neglecting post - early - agb evolved stars , which leave the hayashi track at lower luminosity before the first thermal pulse ( castellani & tornamb 1991 ) . under these assumptions , we computed sbf amplitudes for the reference stellar populations with solar metallicity and @xmath72 , by simulating a different amount of pagb stars ( @xmath122 ) for the same total number of stars . to perform these simulations",

    "we also note that the stars evolving down along their wd cooling sequence are not expected to provide a significant contribution in optical bands .",
    "in fact , it becomes more and more negligible as the wds luminosity decreases , even though they pile up due to longer evolutionary times .",
    "the relations transforming the theoretical quantities ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) into observables ( magnitude and colors ) are of fundamental importance in modeling sbf . in general , theoretical relations between colors",
    "/ bolometric constant and temperatures suffer from the complexity in treating molecular and atomic transitions when the metal content increases and the star temperature decreases .",
    "when the metal content grows up to solar or super - solar values , these difficulties become more and more severe due to the formation of grains and complex molecules in the outer part of the atmosphere , which cause strong blanketing effects ( bell 1973 ) . on the other hand ,",

    ". such a large difference may be due to the fact that g87 transformations have been calibrated with ggcs , which are low metallicity objects . lcb97 and cgk97 models give quite similar predictions for all the optical and nir bands .",
    "sizeable differences are only expected in @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands , where the sbf are about @xmath131 brighter in cgk97 models .    in order to understand the origin of these differences we show the color - magnitude location of the most luminous stars of a solar - metallicity isochrone aged @xmath50 transformed by adopting all the quoted compilations . for clarity ,",

    "[ fig11 ] we used bessel 1979 ) , the differences become negligible , making alonso et al .",

    "for all these reasons we decided not to use these color - temperature relations in computing sbf .",
    "as a first step we compare our sbf predictions in several bands with actual observations of stellar systems ( ggcs and galaxies ) with known distances . then , the theoretical sbf are used to derive the characteristics of a selected sample of observed stellar populations .",
    "the only sbf measurements related to ggcs are those by at94 for a sample of 19 objects .",
    "there are several reasons to study the sbf of these objects : 1 ) ggcs span a range in metallicity down to values lower than expected in galaxies ; 2 ) since they are thought to be formed by the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous gas cloud , they are the best observational counterpart of theoretical ssps ; 3 ) the sbf of ggcs are determined directly from their resolved stars ( differently from galaxies , which require a more complex analysis ) .",
    "thus ggcs sbf represent a simple and unambiguous target to verify the stellar evolution assumptions .    before going on ,",
    "it is worth noticing that , since the amount of stars in a globular cluster ( @xmath139 ) is far lower than the stellar content in a typical galaxy ( @xmath140 ) , this might bear on the sbf evaluations due to statistical reasons .",
    "consequently , the proper way to evaluate theoretical sbf for ggcs is to compute simulated cmds ( with total number of stars @xmath141 ) and apply directly the equations @xmath142 of ts88 . in spite of the difference in the total number of stars , the resulting sbf are quite similar ( within the uncertainties ) to the values for @xmath143 derived from the procedure presented in section 1 ( table  1 ) .",
    "such a stability in the computed sbf amplitudes is due to the compensation of two conflicting effects , which arise when the size of the simulated stellar population decreases .",
    "on one side , the number of stars expected in the fastest and brightest evolutionary phases ( e.g. tp , agb ) tends to vanish , and fainter sbf amplitudes are obtained . on the other side ,",
    "the number of bright rgb stars decreases providing less populated rgb ; statistical effect become relevant ( see also bcpr00 ) , leading to brighter sbf amplitudes .",
    "since at94 measurements are available only for @xmath144 bands , the comparison with theoretical models can be done only for these two filters . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] the ggcs observational data are compared with our models . the observational absolute sbf magnitudes for each globular cluster are obtained from the at94 data according to the expression : @xmath145 , where dm is the distance modulus .",
    "the latter quantity , the metallicity , and other properties are from the latest version of the electronic catalog compiled by harris ( 1999 ) , and are summarized in table  7 , which also reports the observed sbf values . in the figure",

    "the dotted lines represent the mean line according to bva01 prescriptions ( their eq .  5 ) .",
    "from fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] it is apparent that :    @xmath146 the dm directly derived from the theoretical sbf are in very good agreement with the recent evaluation from other distance indicators ;    @xmath147 the general trend of observed sbf versus metallicity is well reproduced by theoretical models ; this fact is noteworthy because the @xmath69 $ ] values of ggcs are measured directly and not just derived by integrated colors .    finally , let us note that the good agreement between the single measurements and the models is particularly relevant considering that no effort has been put in reproducing the peculiarities of each individual ggc ( e.g. hb morphology , brightest stars , etc . ) .",
    "unfortunately , no ggc with @xmath148 is known , and one needs to look at elliptical galaxies and bulges of spirals to verify the degree of accuracy of sbf predictions for metal rich populations .    for this purpose , we extract a subsample of galaxies from the t01 @xmath8-band database by selecting objects with reliable distance estimates as derived by ferrarese et al .",
    "the result is given in table  8 , where data of 31 galaxies are summarized . in the table we report from left to right : the galaxy name , the morphological type t , the visual absorption @xmath149 , the integrated color @xmath68 , and the sbf apparent magnitudes in @xmath150 , and @xmath11 filters .",
    "the last column reports the galaxy distance derived from cepheids , when available ( 8 galaxies ) , otherwise the average distance from other indicators ( ferrarese et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we note that , for the sample of galaxies with cepheid - based distances , the new calibrations of the period - luminosity ( pl ) and period - luminosity - metallicity ( plz ) relations by freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) lead to dm which differ on average of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",

    "database for sake of homogeneity and clearness .",
    "we test the consistency of our predicted sbf starting from galaxies with distances evaluations based on cepheids , as they are the most reliable distance indicator .",
    "since the sbf method works at its best with spheroidal galaxies , there is a relative scarcity of sbf measurements for spirals , and even less objects with both sbf and cepheids distance determinations .",
    "we first focus the attention to the @xmath8-band , due to its importance for the calibration of the empirical relation ( t01 ) , and then we extend the analysis to other photometric bands . fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] illustrates the comparison of the sampled galaxies with the present models ; the empirical line by t01 is also plotted .",
    "the figure shows that all the galaxies well match the theoretical models with @xmath153 .",
    "we emphasize that the zero point of the empirical relation by t01 is derived directly from cepheids - calibrated distances , while the present theoretical sbf are completely independent of them . at @xmath154",
    "the theory predicts a nearly constant value of @xmath8-band sbf for models of similar age , as already verified on ggcs measurements .",
    "moreover , this appears in agreement with the location of the galaxy ngc 5253 ( not plotted in the figure ) reported in fig .  8 by bva01 .    by extending the comparison to all the galaxies in table  8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) , the agreement remains good , even if few of the observed values appear fainter than those predicted by the theory and by the empirical line .",
    "we note that the galaxies showing the largest scatters ( ngc 4278 and ngc 4565 ) have distance measurements with a quite large spread , if compared to internal uncertainties ( ferrarese et al . 2000 ) .    taking advantage from multi - band observations , in fig .",
    "[ fig15]a , b , c we report a similar comparison for @xmath155 , and @xmath11 filters . following jensen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we discard ngc 4536 from their sample because its anomalous @xmath11-band sbf magnitude appears to be due to clumpy dust contamination .",
    "[ fig15 ] shows that our theoretical predictions are consistent with observations not only in the @xmath8-band , but also in other selected optical and nir filters .",
    "this result is relevant for two reasons .",
    "first , the agreement of absolute values of the sbf amplitudes suggests that the present theoretical sbf , computed in the other selected photometric bands , may be adopted to derive distances too .",
    "second , the agreement over a wide range in wavelength supports the reliability of the global theoretical assumptions on the stellar population from which we derive the sbf .",
    "being the proposed theoretical framework supported by sbf observations , at least in the main relevant features , we are led to push forward the capability of the sbf technique and to tentatively infer information on age and metallicity from the sbf measurements of the quoted sample of galaxies .      once the distance of an object is known or in the case of several objects all at the same distance ( e.g. cluster galaxies ) , one may want to use the sbf models for deriving ages and metallicities of the stellar populations .",
    "to this end we test here the internal consistency of the sbf models in various bands , basically @xmath156 and @xmath11 .",
    "as further point we verify the reliability of the inferred ( average ) age and metallicity through the comparison with literature values derived by other methods .    the problem of evaluating the age and metallicity of stellar populations in elliptical galaxies is a largely debated topic ( see for example henry & worthey 1999 and reference therein ) .",
    "thus , to select measurements or evaluations of those quantities which can probe the reliability of sbf models in deriving @xmath157 and @xmath58 is a quite a difficult step .",
    "for example , one has to face with the problem that ellipticals are constituted by complex stellar populations , i.e. by age / metallicity mixed populations ( e.g. baugh , cole , frenk 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; saglia et al . 2002 ) , while we use the approximation of single - burst stellar population .",
    "another difficulty comes from the evidence that metallicity and/or age gradients are observed in some ellipticals ( peletier et al .",
    "1990 ; carollo , danziger & buson 1993 , kobayashi & arimoto 1999 ) .",
    "as a further complication sbf measurements and @xmath158 evaluations from other indicators may refer to not - overlapping regions of the studied galaxy .    keeping in mind",
    "the quoted ( relevant ) warnings , it is still interesting to evaluate ages and metallicities from sbf measurements by using the present theoretical models",
    ". clearly , the following results refer to sbf measured in relatively extended galaxy regions , and they are valid in the approximation that in these regions there is a dominant stellar population ( ferreras , charlot & silk 1999 ) .",
    "for all these reasons the comparison between our predictions on @xmath158 , and those obtained using other methods have to be considered with caution , and within the quoted approximations .",
    "the age and metallicity we derive have large uncertainties as expected from the quoted limitations .",
    "a more detailed investigation is out of the aim of this paper and it should rely on mixed populations models , and also on sbf measurements for which the radial distribution is known ( e.g. sodemann & thomsen 1995 ) .    in order to test our ability of predicting age and metallicity , we built a sample of 15 galaxies for which these quantities have been given by other authors ( table  9 ) .",
    "most of these objects come from the compilation by tfwg00 and by terlevich & forbes ( 2002 : tf02 ) , who used @xmath159 , _ mg b _ , and @xmath160 line strengths to derive age and metallicity for a large sample of elliptical galaxies ( see the quoted papers for more details ) .",
    "these estimations are derived from observational data taken at smaller radii with respect to sbf measurements ( except in the case of jensen et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , tfwg00 find indications of age and metallicity gradients ( see their tables 6a and 6b ) .    to start with ,",

    "since we are dealing with absolute sbf amplitudes , a particular care has to be taken in selecting the distance moduli required to translate the observed apparent sbf values .",
    "obviously , cepheids distances are preferred ; when they are not available for a single galaxy , we use group - averaged distances . to avoid circular arguments",
    ", we recomputed the group distance moduli by ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2000 ) excluding sbf - derived distances , i.e. averaging on the cepheids , pnlf and trgb distances .",

    "[ fig19 ] shows that the separation between models with different chemical composition is high enough to allow an evaluation of metallicity in spite of the non - negligible mean error of the observational sbf color .",
    "in particular , by adopting this kind of diagram the ambiguity shown in the @xmath9-band sbf ( fig .  [ fig16 ] ) for some galaxies can be solved .",
    "for instance , ngc 224 properties are now derived by simple interpolation of the sbf models . similarly to ngc 224 , we can take advantage by this diagram , and the age metallicity degeneration is fairly removed for several other galaxies . in table  9",
    "( columns 910 ) we summarize the results , reporting the age and metallicity values as inferred from the location of the sbf measurements of each given galaxy in the @xmath199 plane .",
    "one may note that the fair agreement found between the results in column ( 79 ) and ( 810 ) in table  9 supports the general consistency of the two sbf methods .",
    "however , few galaxies show some differences .",
    "this is not surprising because several sources of uncertainty are at work , in a differential way , inside the two methods .",
    "let us recall few of them : i ) the distance moduli , ii ) the presence of secondary populations , and iii ) the reddening .",
    "each of these requires evaluations or assumptions which affect the location of the observational points in the two diagrams .    before concluding this section ,",
    "let us emphasize that all our results come from single - burst stellar population models . on this respect",
    ", we recall that by comparing their models with observations in the plane @xmath197 versus @xmath202 , bva01 conclude that composite stellar populations appear necessary for those galaxies with @xmath204 .",
    "on the other hand , the present models for simple stellar populations seem to match , at least within the observational uncertainties , the locus of the available measurements ( see fig .  [ fig20 ] ) ; in particular , the two local group galaxies ngc 221 and 224 are well fitted . of course , in order to better reproduce the @xmath205 of each individual galaxy ( see for example the galaxy with the highest @xmath206 : ngc 4472 )",
    ", it could be useful to introduce composite stellar populations , even if this implies to adopt _ ad hoc scenarios _ ( see bva01 ) .",
    "according with the above discussion , the single - burst models proposed in this work can be reliably adopted for both distance estimations and stellar population analysis .",
    "some useful expressions can be given to obtain a straightforward determination of the sbf magnitudes once the integrated @xmath68 color of a galaxy has been measured .",

    "the calibration of the @xmath7-band is fairly similar to the one presented by bva01 .",
    "concerning the @xmath100 calibration , it appears quite different from the empirical result by lgc02 . in particular , the theoretical calibration predicts an opposite trend with respect to the empirical one .",
    "this opposite behavior has been also discussed by lgc02 ; here we just point out that the age of the observed stellar population may play a relevant role .",
    "in fact fig .",
    "[ fig15](b ) shows an age dependence of the @xmath9-band sbf amplitudes much larger than those expected in @xmath6 and @xmath8 bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig15](a ) , and fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) .",
    "more complex models ( e.g lgc02 ) , and further observations in the @xmath9-band are required to clarify this discrepancy . a similar result is obtained for @xmath191 when the calibration is compared to the empirical one recently found by jensen et al . (",
    "thus , the fact that nir @xmath205 age and metallicity variations have no degenerate effects , make quite problematic to derive accurate one - parameter sbf calibrations for these wavelengths .    in conclusion , the theoretical @xmath214 versus @xmath68 relations agree well ( but nir filters ) with the empirical relations , even in the simple adopted scenario of single - burst populations .",
    "in this paper we have developed a new theoretical model for sbf predictions of simple stellar populations ( single - burst , single chemical composition ) with age ranging from 5 to 15 @xmath22 , and metallicity from @xmath15 to @xmath215 , relatively to the standard @xmath19 ground - based filters and the @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath11 , and @xmath21 of the hst photometric system ( _ wfpc2 _ and _ nicmos _ ) .",
    "the model relies on the stellar population synthesis code developed by brocato et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , optimized for a fine simulation of the latest ( brightest ) phases of stellar evolution , which has strong influence on sbf magnitudes .",
    "the procedure adopted to compute the sbf amplitudes is different from previous theoretical works , and it has the advantage of being quite similar to the observational approach , currently used to measure the pixel to pixel fluctuation in real galaxies .    with this tool we simulated the effect of the mass loss processes along the rgb , the agb and the tp .",
    "in particular , the impact of mass loss on the prediction of sbf magnitudes has been investigated , finding that a careful treatment of this quantity is fundamental in determining reliable sbf evaluations .    according to formalism by reimers , we adopted @xmath220 for the rgb stars .",
    "an independent calibration of the efficiency of mass loss along the agb was performed by using the sbf technique .",
    "a set of models with different assumption on @xmath107 was computed .",
    "the observed sbf measurements of ggcs and galaxies efficiently constraint the theoretical expectations , showing that the data are well reproduced by ssp of the proper age and metallicity if @xmath18 .",
    "such value well agree with observational data ( le bertre et al .",
    "2001 ) , and impressively reproduces the absolute @xmath9-band magnitude of the stars at the tip of the agb in ngc 224 . to our knowledge this is the first time that sbf measurements are used to constraints stellar evolution models of agb stars .    we also compared our models with previous works ( bva01 , lcg02 ) , finding a substantial general agreement in spite of the different stellar evolution models adopted in the computations of the ssps which generate the sbf evaluations .",
    "the impact on sbf , due to the assumption on the imf , is investigated and quantified by adopting a set of reasonable values of the exponent of a scalo - like mass distribution .",
    "the consequences of cutting the imf at a low mass limit are also presented .",
    "as expected , it is found that the contribution of upper part of the ms could not be neglected .",
    "we investigate the effects on sbf predictions of different assumptions on the relation to transform theoretical quantities ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) to the observed magnitudes and colors .",
    "we find that the g87 , cgk97 , and lcb97 compilations provide quite similar sbf predictions for models with @xmath128 , while sizeable differences should be expected if ssp of high @xmath58 are involved .",
    "once the theoretical framework defining the ssp models is fixed , we successfully checked the capability of deriving distances by our sbf predictions .",
    "this is done for a sample of ggcs for which sbf measurements are available and with a sample of properly selected galaxies of known distances .    as a result , a set of calibrations of absolute sbf magnitudes for classical @xmath19 photometric bands and for selected hst filters is provided . the quoted test with other distance indicators ( cepheids , planetary nebula luminosity function , sbf empirical relations , etc .",
    ") shows that the degree of accuracy and precision of the present theoretical calibration of the absolute sbf magnitudes is sufficient to justify the use of these theoretical sbf as a _ primary distance indicator_.    on the other side , we tested the use of sbf as tracers of stellar populations properties .",
    "in particular , we derived ages and metallicities for a subsample of galaxies for which sbf observations and reliable distances are available .",
    "the results appear very promising , since the obtained values are comparable with evaluation derived by other methods .    moreover , _ sbf color _ versus _ integrated color _ diagrams are proposed as particularly useful in removing the well known age - metallicity degeneracy ( e.g. worthey 1994 ) which affects our knowledge of remote stellar systems .",
    "finally , we suggest that future observations should take advantage of the high sensibility of sbf measurements as stellar population tracers in the blue side of the spectral energy distribution of galaxies . this would be a meaningful scientific target for ground - based telescopes with high efficiency in the @xmath5 wavelength range ( vst ) or for telescope located out of the earth atmosphere ( hst , ngst ) .",
    "_ acknowledgments : _ financial support for this work was provided by miur - cofin 2000 , under the scientific project `` stellar observables of cosmological relevance '' .",
    "this project made use of computational resources granted by the consorzio di ricerca del gran sasso according to the progetto 6 calcolo evoluto e sue applicazioni ( rsv6) - cluster c11/b .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the manuscript and for several useful suggestions for clarifying the presentation ; his / her constructive report helped us to improve the paper .",
    "for sake of clearness we outline here the major steps of the procedure we have adopted to derive sbf magnitudes .    as a first step one needs to evaluate the total flux emitted by a stellar population generated by a single burst of star formation . in our model",
    "we make the assumption that the integrated light is dominated by the emission generated by stars of the simulated stellar system .",
    "this implies that i ) no source of non - thermal emission are at work , ii ) the thermal emission by interstellar gas gives no sizeable contribution to the integrated flux , and iii ) the absorption from dust and gas are negligible . on this base ,",
    "the integrated flux in a selected photometric filter ( @xmath26 ) can be obtained by knowing two quantities :        where the @xmath223 is the flux emitted by a star of mass @xmath224 , age @xmath157 ( = stellar system age ) , luminosity @xmath225 , effective temperature @xmath226 , and chemical composition ( @xmath227 , @xmath58 ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath223 is defined by an extended library of homogeneous and self - consistent stellar evolutionary tracks ( see section 2 ) , but it also depends on the adopted transformation tables ( see par .",
    "4.3 ) .    the second quantity @xmath228 is strictly related to the imf and represents the number of stars with mass @xmath224 in a population globally constituted of @xmath229 stars with age @xmath157 and chemical composition ( @xmath227 , @xmath58 ) .",
    "a fundamental point is that the distribution of star masses along the imf is obtained by using a monte carlo random method .",
    "a special attention was payed to ensure that , when a set of simulations with the same input parameters is computed , each distribution is fully independent from previous extractions .",
    "thus this quantity evaluates absolute integrated flux of a stellar population of @xmath229 stars with age @xmath157 , chemical composition ( @xmath227 , @xmath58 ) , and given imf , as located at the reference distance of @xmath232 .",
    "if a number @xmath233 of simulations with exactly the same input parameters are computed , the resulting @xmath234 $ ] is _ not _ expected to be constant since the initial mass distribution of each simulation is randomly generated .",
    "thus , even if we adopt the same imf law , each @xmath235-@xmath236 mass distribution is fully independent from previous extractions . as a consequence , the resulting distribution of the stars in the cmd changes . in particular ,",
    "the bright stars on the rgb / agb ( i.e. the most relevant contributors to the integrated light ) are expected to undergo to sizeable variations in number and cmd position , and this qualitatively explains the fluctuations of @xmath230 .    in principle",
    ", this can be considered quite similar to what happen in observing an ideal galaxy where the same population is spreaded in a number of pixels . under the assumption of a ideal galaxy constituted of a homogeneous stellar population ,",
    "the number and the luminosity of bright stars may change moving from pixel to pixel again due to poisson statistical fluctuations .",
    "thus , the measured flux in each pixel is expected to be affected by the fluctuations ( ts88 ) .            from the operational point of view , for each set of parameters ( age , chemical composition , imf , etc . ) which identifies a stellar population model , we compute a large number of independent simulations ( @xmath240 ) deriving the @xmath241 for each model . at this point the sbf flux is computed directly using the right terms of equation @xmath242 and the definition of @xmath243 . finally , the sbf flux is converted in the sbf magnitude @xmath30 in usual way , being :      in order to compare our method for computing sbf with those obtained applying the `` usual '' procedure ( i.e. to integrate the luminosity function times the squared flux per luminosity bin and divide by the total flux : ts88 , bva01 , etc . ) , we directly computed , for several input parameters , the sbf values by using both our method and the usual one . to provide a quantitative example ,",
    "we report in table  a1 the results for stellar population models with @xmath36 and @xmath175 .",
    "the procedure outlined here gives sbf amplitudes in agreement with those obtained from the usual method , when the number of stars ( @xmath24 ) in each simulation is so large that all the brightest bins in the luminosity function have a number of stars greater than zero .",
    "the condition needed for a full equivalence of the two methods is satisfied when the limit of large numbers is approached ( ts88 ) .",
    "we find that this limit is reached when @xmath245 ( in the mass interval @xmath246 ) , just because the probability of finding very bright stars in each simulation becomes high enough . as @xmath24 decreases , the differences between the sbf values computed by adopting the two methods increase .    although the procedure outlined in this work is not particularly efficient in terms of computational time , it has some advantages . as a first point ,",
    "the present approach to derive sbf amplitudes is more similar to the observational way of measuring sbfs in real galaxies .",
    "in fact , the opportunity of generating @xmath27 independent stellar populations each of them including @xmath24 stars closely resembles what it is directly measured in @xmath27 pixels of a galaxy ccd image ( neglecting the seeing effects ) , where the single pixel contains @xmath24 stars . here",
    ", we have typically adopted @xmath247 which may represent the estimated number of stars per pixel for a galaxy in the virgo cluster observed with a ccd having 0.3\" / pix ( section 2 ) .",
    "for such an assumption , the limit of large numbers is not satisfied .",
    "this implies a relatively small shift between the sbf amplitudes obtained with our procedure and the usual one as shown in table  a1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] ) .    as a new interesting results we suggest that the sbf magnitudes appear to have a small but not negligible dependence on the population ( pixel ) star density .",
    "although this dependence is only a second order correction , it should be further investigated , both on theoretical and observational side , for a deeper understanding and a refining of the sbf method .",
    "in particular , we suggest that the present approach would be useful when dealing with sbf measurements obtained by pixels where the expected number of stars is relatively low ( nearby galaxies , high resolution telescopes , loose galaxies ) when compared with typical observations in ellipticals .    as a final consideration on the capability of the present way of computing sbf",
    "we note that it is also particularly efficient in handling the details of all the stellar evolutionary phases .",
    "in fact , each independent stellar population is computed by leaving to the statistics the possibility of distributing stars in the cmds , according to their proper evolutionary pattern . on the other hand",
    ", the usual way makes use of predefinite isochrones which fix , by definition , one single pattern in the cmd ( i.e. a fixed luminosity function ) for each set of input parameters ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "a relevant example is the hb stars distribution . as previously shown by rood et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , the hb morphology can hardly be described by uniparametric ( mass ) curves as assumed when dealing with isochrones . in our procedure",
    "we always compute a synthetic hb which reproduces the color spread and relative star counts observed in real hbs ( brocato et al .",
    "moreover , isochrones are generally computed by assuming a fixed value of mass loss rate along the rgb . on the contrary , in the present stellar population synthesis",
    "code the mass loss and its spread around an average value can be chosen as free input parameters ( section 4.2.1 ) .",

    "<S> it is found that @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands sbf amplitudes are powerful diagnostics for the morphology of the horizontal branch and the post - agb stars population . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that a careful treatment of mass loss process along the rgb and agb is fundamental in determining reliable sbf evaluations .    </S>",
    "<S> the sbf measurements are used to give robust constraints on the evolution of agb stars , suggesting that mass loss activity on agb stars should be twice more efficient than on the rgb stars .    </S>",
    "<S> our models are able to reproduce the absolute sbf magnitudes of the galactic globular clusters and of galaxies , and their integrated colors . </S>",
    "<S> new calibrations of absolute sbf magnitude in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 photometric filters are provided , which appear reliable enough to directly gauge distances bypassing other distance indicators .    </S>",

    "<S> sbf color _ versus _ integrated color _ diagrams are proposed as particularly useful in removing the well known _ age - metallicity degeneracy _ affecting our knowledge of remote stellar systems . </S>"
