    "it has been known for almost 15 years that early - type galaxies obey a tight relation linking their structure with their kinematics .",
    "originally discovered by djorgovski & davis and dressler et al .",
    ", the fundamental plane ( fp ) establishes that the effective radius ( @xmath2 ) , the mean effective surface brightness ( @xmath3 ) and the central velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) are related by    @xmath5    the fp is one of the main scaling relations for early - type galaxies ( e.g. pahre , djorgovski & de carvalho 1998 , hereafter p98 ) . the fact that , compared to other relations , its scatter is so small , has made it a useful distance indicator ( jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1996 , hereafter j96 ) . historically , the fp is a refinement of the faber - jackson , relation between galaxy luminosity and @xmath6 , which includes the dependency of luminosity and @xmath6 on surface brightness ( kormendy ) .",
    "much work has been devoted to determining the exponents @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "the virial theorem predicts @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , observations show lower values of @xmath7 and higher values of @xmath0 ( busarello et al . 1997 ) . the value @xmath0 has been well determined to be @xmath10 ( p98 , j96 ) .",
    "@xmath7 , usually referred to as the tilt of the fp ( p98 ) , has values that vary significantly depending on the band employed .",
    "several mechanisms are likely to produce the difference between observations and the virial theorem prediction : age and metallicity , shape of the light profiles @xcite variations in the initial mass function ( imf ) or even the dark matter distribution in galaxies @xcite .    beyond its value as a distance indicator ,",
    "the fp contains useful clues on the physics of galactic systems .",
    "the position of galactic bulges on the fp of elliptical galaxies provides information about the differences in stellar populations , internal structure and kinematics of both types of galaxies . in a series of papers , prugniel & simien ( 1994 , 1996 , 1997 )",
    "have gone into the details of using the fp for this purpose .",
    "assuming that the fp is a representation of the virial theorem @xmath11 , and that the mass - to - light ratio scales as @xmath12 , these authors obtain the relation between observables @xmath13 . in their picture , this relation is tight for old elliptical galaxies , since for them @xmath6 is a good mass - indicator , and @xmath14 is a smooth function of l , probably metallicity - driven .",
    "deviations to the relation can be due to the presence of young stellar populations ( causing a change in @xmath14 , see also schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) , rotational support ( since in this case @xmath6 gives an underestimate of the gravitational energy ) , or differences in structure , for example indicated by the shape of the surface brightness profile .",
    "one of the first papers addressing the position of bulges on the fp is the study of bender , burstein & faber ( 1992 , hereafter b92 ) .",
    "they present @xmath0-band fp properties for a large sample of dynamically hot galaxies , which they divide into several groups , referred to as es , intermediate es , compact es , bulges , bright dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals .",
    "b92 conclude that bulges lie preferentially below the fp of ellipticals , suggesting that , on average , bulges are younger than ellipticals .",
    "most ( 17 out of 19 ) of the bulges in b92 are in lenticular galaxies . in a related study using a sample of galaxies from the coma cluster saglia ,",
    "bender & dressler find a small shift in the same direction in the location of bulges when compared with es and s0s ( 0.1 in log(@xmath2 ) in b - band ) .",
    "in contrast with these findings , j96 , in their comparison between the fp of 10 clusters , find a negligible difference between e and s0 galaxies ( @xmath15 in b - band ) , a result shared by prugniel & simien .",
    "the fp of bulges is more complicated to study than that of elliptical galaxies , since a determination of structural parameters requires a decomposition of the light into bulges and disks , as well as to take into account dust reddening and extinction .",
    "these problems only worsen as we move to later types . perhaps as a result of this , very little information is available about the fp of bulges of types later than s0 .",
    "this paper intends to fill this gap by presenting a study of the fp of bulges for types ranging from s0 to sbc .",
    "it belongs to a series of papers discussing the properties of galactic bulges .",
    "the first paper @xcite discusses optical colours and colour gradients of an optically selected , complete , sample of @xmath16 50 bulges of type s0-sbc .",
    "the galaxies were required to have an inclination i @xmath1750@xmath18 to minimize the amount of disk light which projects onto the bulge and ensure that extinction from dust in the disk does not dominate the colours measured on one side of the bulge . of this sample ,",
    "30 galaxies for which the colour profiles were smooth on one side of the bulge ( i.e. where the colours were not significantly affected by dust extinction ) were observed in the near - infrared @xmath1-band at higher spatial resolution .",
    "andredakis , peletier & balcells ( 1995 , hereafter apb95 ) present a photometric decomposition into bulge and disk , using kent s ( 1986 ) model - independent method , after which srsic r@xmath19 laws are fitted to the bulge .",
    "they find that the srsic law generally fits very well , and that there is a good correlation between @xmath20 and morphological type , such that bulges of early - type spiral galaxies follow the r@xmath21 law , while profiles of late type spirals are more nearly exponential .",
    "optical and near - infrared colours of bulges are presented in peletier & balcells .",
    "photometric data for this sample , including colour profiles along major and minor axis and fits of ellipticity and position angle as a function of radius , are presented in peletier & balcells ( 1997 , hereafter pb97 ) .",
    "central color profiles , based on hst / wfpc2 and nicmos imaging of a subsample of 20 of our galaxies , are analysed in peletier et al . .",
    "the latter paper concludes that all bulges , except those of sbc s , are old with an age spread of less than 2 gyr .",
    "the present paper makes use of our own spectroscopy of the sample to address the position of bulges on the fp of elliptical galaxies .",
    "a full report of the kinematic properties derived from the spectroscopy will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "when analyzing bulges , several authors have made the assumption that bulges surface brightness profiles are either @xmath22 or exponential @xcite , a dichotomy of shapes that would suggest a dichotomy of formation processes .",
    "carollo also divides bulges into @xmath22 and exponential classes in her study of galaxy nuclei . in our work",
    "we define and characterize a bulge on the basis of its signature in the galaxy s ellipticity profile , rather than on the shape of the surface brightness profile .",
    "we thus avoid having to assign each bulge to a given profile class , and indeed we find a continuum of profile shapes , which we model with srsic s law with free index @xmath20 , rather than two separate classes . because our sample includes objects ranging from exponential to @xmath22 , our fp study should uncover any structural and population signatures that depend on the shape of the surface brightness profile .",
    "section  2 summarises the observations and data reduction as well as procedures to derive the different structural and kinematic parameters . in ",
    "3 we show the fp in the different bands and compare the results with other authors .",
    "the mg@xmath23 - @xmath24 relation is analysed in  4 .",
    "possible correlations between observables and the residuals of the fp are studied in  5 . throughout the paper",
    "we use a hubble constant of @xmath25=50 kms@xmath26mpc@xmath26 .",
    "we obtained long - slit spectra of our sample galaxies at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope of the observatorio del roque de los muchachos at la palma between 11 and 13 july 1997 .",
    "nineteen galaxies were observed ( see table  1 ) .",
    "all galaxies were observed between 3660 - 5560   and between 8360 - 9170 using the isis blue and red arms , respectively .",
    "the red arm was equipped with the tektronix ( 1024@xmath271024 ) tek2 ccd ( 0.36 `` per 24 @xmath28 m pixel ) and the r600r grating , giving a spectral resolution ( fwhm of arc lines ) of 1.74 (60 km / s ) . the blue arm was equipped with the loral ( 2048@xmath272048 ) lor2 ccd , ( 15 @xmath28 m pixels , 0.22 ' ' /pixel ) and the r300b grating , giving a spectral resolution of 4.1  .",
    "we used the 6100   dichroic for simultaneous red and blue arm exposures .",
    "typical exposure times per galaxy were 1500 sec in both wavelength ranges . the slit width was 1.2 \" , matching the seeing at the time of the observations .",
    "arc line exposures were taken before and after each target exposure .",
    "tungsten continuum lamp exposures were taken with the red arm after each target exposure , for fringe calibration .",
    "twilight sky exposures were taken every night for flat fielding .",

    "in the past bulges of spirals have been difficult galactic components to study .",
    "this has been due to the presence of dust , the accompanying disk , and the fact they are generally small , so that very often ground - based observations are affected by lack of resolution .",
    "the appearance of the hubble space telescope in the 1990s has vastly improved the situation .",
    "peletier et al .",
    "performed a detailed study of galactic bulges using nicmos observations , giving as a result a much more detailed insight of ages and dust in these objects than was known before .",
    "the main conclusions from this work are that early - type bulges ( s0-sb ) behave like ellipticals and seem to be as old as cluster es with very little spread in age ( @xmath16 2 gyr ) .",
    "this supports the hypothesis of an early formation for bulges and ellipticals , via either dissipational collapse or early mergers .",
    "late - type bulges ( sbc onwards ) show hints of youth with respect to the early - types and could belong to a class of objects formed or transformed by secular disk evolution .",
    "in general they are smaller , younger and have lower central surface brightness .",
    "the question then is whether they fall on the same fundamental plane decribed by es and s0s .",
    "we have measured the mean separation of our bulges with respect to the fp of es and s0s ( as defined by the es / s0s of j96(coma ) ) and found a small but non - negligible offset of 0.074 @xmath30 0.033 in the @xmath0-band and 0.054 @xmath30 0.029 in the @xmath1-band . in agreement with other authors ( j96,p98 )",
    "we find that the fp has intrinsic scatter , not explained by observational uncertainties .",
    "the strong proximity of bulges to the fp of ellipticals and s0s reinforces the conclusions of peletier et al .",
    "that early - to - intermediate bulges are homogeneously old and structurally similar to elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is useful in any event to investigate the origin of the intrinsic scatter and the offset .",
    "we first analyse the intrinsic scatter by showing the fp residuals with respect to various galaxy observables .",
    "then , we discuss the roles of populations , kinematics and homology in creating the offset with respect to coma ellipticals .",
    "the existence of this intrinsic scatter has been a matter of debate for the last decade . for ellipticals ,",
    "mobasher et al . have proposed the population of agb stars as one of the sources of the intrinsic scatter of the fp in the k - band .",
    "structural and dynamical non - homology may be responsible , at least in part , for the intrinsic scatter @xcite .",
    "recent studies suggest that the intrinsic scatter is probably a combination of age / metallicity variations and dynamical deviations from homology ( p98 and references therein ) . for bulges differences in stellar populations might account for even larger scatter ( e.g. prugniel et al .",
    "2001 ) .    to obtain clues on the origin of the intrinsic scatter of our bulges in the fp , we analyse correlations between the residuals of the fp , defined as @xmath31-fit , using the common fits , and different observables for our sample of bulges : @xmath32 , galaxy type , inclination of the galaxy and srsic index @xmath20 .",
    "these correlations should give us ideas whether the distribution of our bulges along the sequence described by es and s0s depends on the presence of young stars [ @xmath33 , homology or light profile shape [ @xmath34 - galaxy type , @xmath34 - index of the srsic profile ( n ) ] or the degree of anisotropy of the object [ @xmath34 - inclination of the galaxy ( i ) ] .",
    "we perform this study for the 2 bands using the spearman rank order correlation coefficients in each case .",
    "we find that there is no correlation between the residuals of the fp and any of the 3 fp parameters in either b or k , as can be expected from section [ sec : fundplane ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : residglobpars ] shows the distributions of fp residuals as a function of global galaxy parameters in the @xmath0 and @xmath1-band .",
    "points are labeled with the morphological type of the galaxy t. the probability of a null correlation is given within parenthesis in each panel , next to the correlation coefficient .",
    "the point labeled `` -2 '' near the top of each panel corresponds to ngc  7332 .",
    "this point is not included in the computation of correlation coefficients ( see section [ sec : fundplane ] ) .",
    "no signs of correlations are found of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( 96% and 31% , in @xmath0 and @xmath1 band respectively ) .",
    "the same is true if the deviations are taken from the fit of j96 .",
    "if the deviations , both to the fp and the mg@xmath36  @xmath24 relation , are due to young stellar populations , or even to non - inclusion of rotational support , a correlation is expected ( p01 ) . however , for our sample the deviations from both relations are small , and this fact combined with the relatively small size of the sample makes us not see the correlation .",
    "weak trends are found with galaxy type ( 64% and 12% ) in both bands . while weak , the distribution of galaxy types ( within our bulges ) gives a suggestion that the fp residuals may depend on galaxy type , in the sense that late type bulges tend to be below the fp , and early types above .    we do nt find a relation between @xmath34 and @xmath20 , the srsic index .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by graham & colless for virgo cluster galaxies studied in the v band at high s /",
    "such a correlation , however , could be hidden , in part , by stellar populations effects .",
    "prugniel & simien found a correlation between the residuals of the fp and @xmath20 after removing the scatter indiced by the stellar populations . here again",
    "think the small size of the sample prevents us from seeing this correlation .",
    "next we analyse possible correlations between @xmath34 and the inclination of the galaxy ( i ) .",
    "projection effects and the presence of disks are both likely sources of scatter in the fp @xcite . despite the limited range in ellipticities , we find that the probability for a significant correlation is 70% and 95% , in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands respectively .",
    "j96 found that galaxies with a large ellipticity ( presumably edge - ons ) have a slight tendency to lie below the fp .",
    "the residual , for @xmath37 = 0.6 - 0.8 @xmath38  0.10 in log(@xmath39 ) , similar to ours .",
    "the @xmath34 dependence on inclination can contribute to the global offset of our inclined sample w.r.t .",
    "the j96(coma ) fp . we address this in section [ sec : offsets ] .",
    "population age / metallicity differences , internal kinematics and non - homology each can in principle shift bulges with respect to the fp of old ellipticals .",
    "we discuss each in turn .",
    "the position of bulges below the fp of ellipticals could have been produced if bulges are on average younger than elliptical galaxies @xcite . taking the models of vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) one finds that for solar metallicity a decrease in age from 12.5 to 10.0 gyr gives a shift in the log(r@xmath40 ) direction of 0.06 in @xmath0 and 0.04 in @xmath1 , consistent with the results presented here .",
    "this means that possibly the offset could be explained if our sample on the average would be about 2.5 gyr younger than the coma cluster samples used by j96 and p98 .",
    "the effect of rotational support , although small , has been detected by other authors @xcite .",
    "following prugniel & simien , the rotational kinetic energy may be introduced in the fp via a rotational support term @xmath41 to be added to @xmath42 . using our definition of fp and after accounting for the inclination range for our sample , we approximate @xmath41 as    @xmath43    with @xmath44",
    "is from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : fp ] .",
    "since our spectra were obtained along the minor axis of the galaxies , we have not been able to measure @xmath41 for our sample .",
    "we can nevertheless estimate the amount of rotation needed to generate the observed offset .",
    "non - inclusion of the rotation term offsets points _",
    "downward _ on the fp diagram .",
    "a sample average of @xmath45 produces the observed fp offset . within this model ,",
    "the observed offset of our bulges sample with respect to coma ellipticals can be explained by the non - inclusion of rotation data for our bulges .",
    "the effect of non - homology , i.e. that bulges do not all follow the @xmath46 law , has not been found in our data , given that @xmath34 does not correlate with @xmath20 , the srsic index . as noted in section [ sec : residuals ] , prugniel & simien did find such a correlation once the scatter by population effects had been taken into account .    finally , in section [ sec : residuals ] we have identified galaxy inclination as a potential origin for fp offsets .",
    "j96 model the inclination effect by considering the effect of rotation on the measurement of the central velocity dispersion .",
    "this effect is independent of the rotation support term described above .",
    "the previous analysis suggests that any combination of age and kinematics contribution to the fp can explain the offsets of our sample with respect to coma ellipticals , whereas we fail to identify the effects of non - homology .",
    "most plausibly , not a single one of the two processes is responsible for the entire offset .",
    "the latter probably results from a combination of the two .",
    "nevertheless , we note that , while the population contribution rests on a model determination of ages , the kinematic offset is sure to be there ; indeed , bulges rotate and our sample is selected to be inclined .",
    "we have analysed the position of bulges of early - type spirals ( type s0-sbc ) on the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies .",
    "a few conclusions can be drawn from our study :    we find that our sample of bulges early - type spirals lies slightly below the fp , as defined by e and s0 galaxies , both in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "the fact that bulges lie so close to the fp of ellipticals and s0s implies that their formation epoch must have been similar to that of cluster es and s0s .    both age and the unaccounted rotation effects are likely to contribute to the offset observed .",
    "any single one of these effects can account for the observed offset , by assuming either an age on average 2.5 gyr younger than the cluster ellipticals and s0s , or by assuming an average @xmath47 . because rotation must contribute to the fp offset",
    ", the age differential between bulges and cluster ellipticals must be significantly smaller than the mentioned 2.5 gyr .",
    "we find that there is a hint that bulges of later morphological type are situated below the other bulges in our sample , indicating that they have slightly younger ages , again consistent with our results from hst colours .",
    "we confirm the result of prugniel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that bulges have a steeper mg@xmath48  log(@xmath24 ) relation than ellipticals or s0s .",
    "contrary to current lore , the mg@xmath48 ",
    "@xmath24 is not a mass - metallicity relation only , at least for bulges : younger objects seem to increase the slope of the relation ( p01 ) . for our sample , however , the slope is shallower than for p01 , much closer to that of the ellipticals .",

    "<S> in an ongoing effort to study the formation and evolution of galactic bulges we have investigated the position of 19 bulges of type s0-sbc on the fundamental plane ( fp ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that bulges , both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 band , lie close to but slightly below the fp defined by ellipticals and s0s , i.e. are slightly brighter . </S>",
    "<S> there are hints that bulges of later morphological type are situated below the other bulges in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the fp results are consistent with the picture , obtained from our recent analysis of hst - colours , that bulges are old , except for the sbc galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that bulges lie so close to the fp of ellipticals and s0s implies that their formation epoch must have been similar , at most about 2.5 gyr earlier , than cluster es and s0s , and and that the surrounding disk does not significantly affect their structure .    </S>",
