    "ads / cft duality @xcite is a powerful method to study field theories by studying their dual string theories .",
    "usually , full string theories in the curved background , such as @xmath0 , are not solvable .",

    "the low energy region in the string theories is dual to the high energy region in the corresponding field theories side .",
    "however , the low energy region of the field theory is more attractive for practical reason . to study the low energy region of these field theories",
    ", we need to solve the full string theory .",
    "it was shown that by taking penrose limit , @xmath0 geometry reduces to a pp - wave geometry @xcite , which is solvable for the full string theory .    the success of pp - wave method for @xmath0 background led many authors to use it to study some more complicated geometry backgrounds e.g. @xcite .",
    "for example , the near horizon geometry of ns5-branes is the linear dilaton background .",
    "string theory in this background was conjectured to be dual to a non - local field theory @xcite , so called little string theory ( lst ) .",
    "it was shown that the pp - wave limit of this background is the nappi - witten background . string theory in nappi - witten background is again exactly solvable and has been widely studied , see for example @xcite .",
    "a more complicated example is the pp - wave limit of the near horizon geometry of non - extremal ns5-branes , which leads to a time dependent background .",
    "luckily , strings in this time dependent background is also exactly solvable and has been studied in @xcite .",
    "another non - local gauge theory example is non - commutative yang - mills theories ( ncym ) , which are conjectured to be dual to the near horizon geometry of @xmath3 coincide d@xmath4-branes in the presence of the background constant @xmath1 fields .",
    "geometries with different number @xmath4 have been studied in @xcite and more extensively in @xcite , in which the authors claimed that only for d6-brane , the pp - wave limit of the geometry leads to a _ time independent _ background and is solvable . in this work",
    ", we will show that for general d@xmath4-branes , pp - wave limit of the geometry leads to time dependent backgrounds which are solvable in certain limit .",
    "studying string theories in these backgrounds will enable us to understand more about the dual theory - noncommutative yang - mills theory , such as ir / uv mixing , non - local behavior etc .. in addition , through the holography relationship , we can use the time dependent pp - wave background to study the features of rg flow in ncym .    in the next section",

    "the hamiltonian will be obtained for the fluctuation .",
    "we then quantize the model to get the string spectrum in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains discussion on the results .",
    "in this section we consider a system of @xmath5-branes with a constant ns @xmath1 along their world - volume directions .. for simplicity , we consider the @xmath1 field only along the directions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the @xmath8-brane , the supergravity solution can be obtained by performing a t - duality along @xmath9 and then t - dualize back . the solution in string metric is @xcite @xmath10   + f^{1/2}\\left (   dr^{2}+r^{2}d\\omega_{5}% ^{2}\\right )   , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 to study the dual noncommutative yang - mills theory on the boundary , we need to take the background @xmath1 field to infinity @xmath12 . following the procedure in @xcite , we first rescale the parameters as follows @xmath13 then we take the decoupling limit @xmath14 with @xmath15 fixed .",

    "first of all , we set @xmath21 for simplify and define the variables @xmath22 in these notations the metric can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the standard @xmath0 metric .",
    "we call the above metric ( [ modified metric ] ) modified @xmath0 metric because the only deviation of [ new1 ] from the standard @xmath0 metric is given by some @xmath1 field dependent terms",
    ". later we will consider the case of @xmath25 , where the modification from the standard @xmath26 metric is small provided @xmath27 is not too large .",
    "next , to write the above metric in global  coordinates , we use the transformations @xmath28 where the four - vector @xmath29 satisfies the normalization condition @xmath30 and the explicit form of its components is @xmath31 the metric now takes the form as @xmath32 where @xmath33 in the final form of the metric ( [ globle metric ] ) , to keep the metric neat , we did not write @xmath34 and @xmath35 in terms of the new coordinates explicitly in the last two terms .",
    "reader should be careful that there are only 10 independent coordinates in the metric ( [ globle metric ] ) since @xmath27 and @xmath36 @xmath37 are not independent coordinates .",
    "in this section we will study two classical solutions of the sigma model ( [ sigma action ] ) in the modified @xmath0 background ( [ globle metric ] ) which we discussed in the previous section .",
    "one classical solution corresponds to point - like closed strings rotating around the big circle of @xmath2 , and the other corresponds to stretched closed strings rotating around the big circle of @xmath2 .",
    "we then consider the first order fluctuations around these classical solutions to get the transverse hamiltonian .",

    "the resulting hamiltonian is @xmath71 where @xmath72 it is clear that when @xmath73 , which correspond the point - like closed string case in the previous section , the hamiltonian ( [ h2 - string ] ) reduces to the hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) as expected .",

    "similar to the analysis in @xcite , the string spectrum should correspond one - to - one to certain operators in the noncommutative yang - mills theory .",
    "however , the closed string spectrum ( [ quantized e - j ] ) , which we found in the previous section , is time dependent . at first glance",
    "it seems strange that the spectrum depends on time .",
    "in fact , this kind of time dependent spectrum has been studied in @xcite when the authors tried to quantize the string fields in the non - extremal @xmath105-brane background .",
    "the crucial point is that the time @xmath106 in the string spectrum ( [ quantized e - j ] ) is not the space - time time @xmath107 , but the world - sheet time .",
    "actually , the world - sheet time @xmath106 is related to the space - time @xmath27 direction , which measures the energy scale in the holographic description of the boundary field theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the world - sheet time dependent string spectrum corresponds to the operators at the different energy scales and can be interpreted as the rg flow in the dual field theories .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    when we consider the closed string states created by the string fluctuation around the classical solution , a string state @xmath108 corresponds to a operator @xmath109  in the dual field theory ( at certain energy scale @xmath110 ) @xcite . in the absence of background @xmath1 field ,",
    "the hamiltonians of the quadratic fluctuations are time independent , so that the corresponding string state is the same at different world - sheet time @xmath106 along the classical path , as in ( a ) of fig .",
    "thus the string state corresponds to an operator at the same energy scale in the dual field theory . in the presence of @xmath1 field , however , the hamiltonians of the quadratic fluctuations ( [ h2 ] ) or ( [ h2 - string ] ) are time dependent .",
    "the string state could absorb or lose energy to change to another string state over time , so that the string state @xmath111 is different at different time @xmath106 along the classical path , as indicated in ( b ) of fig .",
    "the claim is that a string state varying with the world - sheet time @xmath111 corresponds to a scale dependent operator @xmath112 in the dual field theory running over varying energy scales @xmath113 , i.e. the rg flow in the dual field theory .",
    "the correlation functions of the operators @xmath114 should satisfy the standard callan - symanzik equations . in our case ,",
    "the dual field theory is conjectured to be noncommutative yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "for small @xmath27 the spectrum ( [ quantized e - j ] ) reduces to the string spectrum without the background @xmath1 field , which corresponds to the ir regime of the gauge theory .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that noncommutative yang - mills theory reduces to ordinary yang - mills theory at long distances .",
    "the other important regime of the dual gauge theory is the uv regime .",
    "unfortunately , our result is not able to make any prediction about the uv regime due to the feature of the string spectrum ( [ quantized e - j ] ) that @xmath27 has a finite range and the energy oscillates between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , so that the strings never get to the boundary at @xmath117 in our configuration .",

    "this makes perfect sense since a local field theory is defined at short distances , and in terms of the @xmath123 correspondence this means that the microscopic structure of the theory is encoded on the boundary of the @xmath119 space ; on the other hand , the noncommutative yang - mills theory is a non - local theory with uv / ir mixing , which implies that we should not be able to define the theory at short distances .",
