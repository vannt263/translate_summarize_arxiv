    "for the past two decades density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite has been one of the most powerful tools for the _ ab initio _ calculation of the physical and chemical properties of materials .",
    "methods based on dft make efficient use of computational resources , hence can generally deal with larger and more complex systems than other _",
    "ab initio _ methods .",
    "they also provide a simple interpretation of much of the many - electron physics of materials in terms of ideas based on the electron gas .",
    "a number of implementations of dft exist , which essentially differ in the approach taken to approximating the unknown density functional that describes the contribution to the electronic energy that is _ not _ due to the external potential .",
    "the most successful of these methods is the approach first derived by kohn and sham @xcite , which uses dft to identify the interacting electrons with a non - interacting electron gas , and then solves for the non - interacting electron system .",
    "most of the energy of the system is evaluated exactly , with only a relatively small exchange - correlation contribution requiring approximation .",
    "in addition , the exchange - correlation part of the functional can be well approximated by a simple analytic form , hence this has become the workhorse of accurate dft @xcite .",
    "there is one main disadvantage that concerns us here . within the standard kohn - sham approach",
    "the electron density is expressed as the electron density of a non - interacting , many - electron system , by obtaining the eigenstates of these non - interacting electrons ; this requires @xmath1 operations where @xmath2 is the number of electrons present in the system .",
    "it is this scaling behaviour that limits the size of system that the kohn - sham method can be applied to ( currently less than around 1000 atoms ) .",
    "a more direct and computationally cheaper approach is to minimise the total energy functional with respect to variations in the electron density , @xmath3 ( eg wang et al @xcite ) . in this form",
    "the cost of finding the minimum of the total energy does not depend on @xmath2 provided the non - interacting kinetic energy functional @xmath4 $ ] @xcite is available as an explicit functional of the electron density .",
    "unfortunately , this functional is not known , hence a direct minimisation procedure must employ approximate forms of the kinetic energy functional as well as the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "approximate expression are available , but as @xmath4 $ ] is generally an order of magnitude greater than the exchange - correlation energy they are generally not of sufficient accuracy for structural optimisation , let alone chemical calculations .",
    "another deficiency is that there is no obvious way of applying the familiar non - local pseudopotentials of kohn - sham methods @xcite to these direct minimisation methods , although indirect methods have been proposed by watson et al @xcite , anata and madden @xcite and shah et al @xcite .",
    "other methods have been investigated , such as a path integral formulation of kohn - sham theory @xcite , and several approaches which formulate dft as a @xmath5 order reduced density matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the latter formulation takes advantage of the ` nearsightedness ' ( see kohn @xcite ) of the density matrix to solve for the ground state energy as an @xmath6 problem , with the non - interacting kinetic energy functional evaluated exactly ( eg baroni and giannozzi @xcite , hernndez et al @xcite , ordejon @xcite , and a recent review by goedecker @xcite ) .",
    "although _ ab initio _ @xmath6 approaches of this form are successful , they are currently limited to insulators as the density matrix is long - ranged for systems with no band gap .",
    "a middle ground between the kohn - sham method and direct energy functional minimisation can be found via ` embedding methods ' , and this is the approach considered in this paper . in many cases",
    "the system we are interested in may be divided into two regions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "region @xmath8 is largely the same as a more simple system that may easily be solved for , whereas region @xmath7 is where the interesting physics occurs .",
    "an example would be a defect in a crystal - region @xmath8 would be a bulk crystal , and region @xmath7 a small volume surrounding the defect .",
    "there is an obvious computational advantage in solving for region @xmath8 first , and then solving for region @xmath7 taking into account the influence of region @xmath8 in some way .",
    "this ` embedding ' approach has received a great deal of attention , and a large number of methods have been presented in the literature .",
    "no attempt is given to review all of these , but we refer to publications that describe general classes of methods . for the main part",
    "these differ in the space in which region @xmath7 and region @xmath8 are defined .",
    "inglesfield @xcite defined these regions in real space and constructed an exact embedding scheme that requires a knowledge of the green function of the substrate ( region @xmath8 ) , which is often prohibitively costly to calculate .",
    "regions @xmath7 and @xmath8 can also be defined more generally in hilbert space , as described by fisher @xcite .",
    "another approach is discussed by gutdeutsch et al @xcite , where the @xmath5 order reduced density matrix is partitioned .",
    "all of these schemes are , to a greater or lesser extent , based on a wavefunction description of the embedding process .    here",
    "we apply a different procedure , first described by cortona @xcite and wesolowski and warshel @xcite , that carries out the embedding entirely at the density functional level .",
    "the essential idea is to express the total energy of the system in terms of two kohn - sham like systems with densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( corresponding to regions @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , where the total electron density is given by @xmath11 .",
    "this total energy is then minimised by varying only the electron density @xmath9 , corresponding to fewer electrons than the whole system , and so a cheaper calculation .",
    "potential applications of this method include defects in crystals , or adsorbates on surfaces , since once a solution for the substrate is available the remainder of the calculation would only involve the kohn - sham representation of the electrons in the immediate vicinity of the defect or adsorbate .",
    "this partially frozen electron density method has been implemented by cortona @xcite , wesolowski et al @xcite and ( in a slightly different context ) govind et al@xcite in a form that describes the coupling between the two subsystems via approximate kinetic energy functionals .",
    "a localised set of basis functions was used in each case .    in this paper",
    "this procedure is implemented within a plane - wave pseudopotential framework @xcite .",
    "we investigate the approach for metallic systems where the electrons in regions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are strongly interacting , whereas past applications have focused on insulating systems and a relatively weak interaction .",
    "our goal is to develop an embedding approach accurate enough , and computationally cheap enough , to aid the investigation of large scale defect and adsorbate systems . as a preliminary to this we test and",
    "analyse the approach by constructing a four atom cell of bulk fcc aluminium by embedding one cubic sub - lattice of atoms within three others .",
    "sections [ sec : embthe ] and [ sec : appke ] describe the implementation of the method , with approximate kinetic energy functionals described from the viewpoint of a plane - wave basis .",
    "subsection [ sec : approxrho1 ] presents the results of the method applied to bulk fcc aluminium , with a number of different kinetic energy functionals . in subsection [ sec : exactrho1 ] a modified form of the method is applied in order to analyse the source of errors , again for different functionals .",
    "another important issue in the direct application of dft methods is the inclusion of non - local pseudopotentials . in subsection",
    "[ sec : nonloc ] we present and justify the assumptions that must be made in order to employ non - local pseudopotentials within the embedding scheme .",
    "rydberg atomic units are used throughout unless otherwise stated .",

    "since @xmath10 is taken as already known , this method of obtaining the electronic structure need only solve for the electrons present in @xmath9 , a smaller number ( in many cases considerably smaller ) than is present in the entire system .",

    "in addition it should be remembered that even if the approximate functional gives the correct kinetic energy for the true density , this may not be a minimum of the total energy with respect to variations in the density .",

    "calculations performed with a non - local pseudopotential produce results for the total energy and electron density which are of comparable accuracy to the local pseudopotential case .",
    "calculations are also carried out for an altered form of the method where part of the kinetic contribution to the embedding potential and energy is obtained exactly . this corresponded to performing a hohenberg - kohn minimisation of the total energy expressed in terms of the electron density with an approximate kinetic energy functional applied to the entire system . as implemented here",
    "this minimisation allows the use of non - local pseudopotentials , and introduces the constraint @xmath81 where @xmath10 is some reference substrate system .",
    "results are worse than for the true embedding scheme for all the semi - local functionals , with the exception of @xmath82 which gives a slightly greater error in the energy , but a slightly improved electron density . from this",
    "it seems reasonable to conclude that the approximate non - additive kinetic energy is more accurate than the approximate total kinetic energy for these functionals .",
    "the non - local functional gives the most accurate results , with the energy accurate to @xmath83 ev atom@xmath84 and the electron density accurate to @xmath85 milli - electrons @xmath79 .",
    "this suggests that the non - local functional produces the most accurate representation of the both the value of the kinetic energy functional and its functional derivative , and that the errors in the functional derivative are greatest when the electron density is low .",
    "we interpret the extremely good agreement between the kohn - sham electron density and embedding results found in subsection [ sec : exactrho1 ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) in comparison with that found in subsection [ sec : approxrho1 ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) for the non - local functional to be due to the success of this functional in describing bulk aluminium as discussed by wang et al @xcite . for systems where the _ total _ electron density is far from homogeneous ( eg surface / adsorbate )",
    "this success of the method of subsection [ sec : exactrho1 ] is not expected to hold . in future applications the non - local functional and the method of subsection",
    "[ sec : approxrho1 ] are expected to provide the most accurate reconstruction of the full kohn - sham result .",
