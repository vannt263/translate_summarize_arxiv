    "low energy @xmath7 and @xmath8 interactions have been subject of extensive studies during the last two decades .",
    "the well known phenomenological analysis of @xmath7 scattering lengths by martin  @xcite demonstrated that the @xmath9-wave @xmath10 scattering length is large and repulsive , @xmath11 fm , while for the @xmath12 case it is moderately attractive , @xmath13  fm .",
    "recently , new data on the strong - interaction @xmath14 level shift of kaonic hydrogen atoms were obtained at kek ( kpx experiment )  @xcite and frascati ( dear )  @xcite .",
    "they correspond to the following repulsive values of the @xmath10 scattering length @xmath15 for kpx , and @xmath16 for dear .    nevertheless , as it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , the actual @xmath10 interaction can be attractive if the isoscalar @xmath17 resonance is a bound state of the @xmath18 system .",
    "such a scenario can be explained within chiral perturbation theory where the leading order term in the chiral expansion for the @xmath19 amplitude is attractive .",
    "further developments in the analysis of the @xmath18 interaction based on chiral lagrangians can be found in refs .",
    "such a peculiar behavior of the @xmath20 dynamics leads to very interesting in - medium effects for anti - kaons in finite nuclei as well as in dense nuclear matter , including neutron stars , see _",
    "e.g. _ papers  @xcite and references therein .    exotic few - body nuclear systems involving the @xmath21-meson as a constituent were predicted by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite .",
    "they argued that the @xmath18 interaction is characterized by a strong @xmath22 attraction , which allows the few - body systems to form dense and deeply bound @xmath21-nuclear states .",
    "evidence for a strange tribaryon @xmath23 with a width below 21 mev was observed in the interaction of stopped @xmath24-mesons with @xmath25he  @xcite .",
    "this state was interpreted as a candidate for a deeply bound state @xmath26 with @xmath27 @xcite . however , the @xmath23 is about 100 mev below the predicted mass , and in the experiment an isospin-1 state was detected at a position where no such peak was predicted .",
    "it was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite that this discrepancy can be resolved by tuning parameters of the model  @xcite .",
    "the results of akaishi and yamazaki  @xcite were criticized by oset and toki  @xcite who argued that the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is unrealistic .",
    "oset and toki also suggested that the peaks in the reaction with @xmath28 can be due to @xmath24 absorption on a pair of nucleons .",
    "this suggestion puts doubt whether a narrow tribaryon @xmath23 really exists .",
    "another tentative evidence for a @xmath29 bound state produced in @xmath24 absorption at rest on different nuclear targets was found by the finuda collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it was detected through its two - body decay into a @xmath30 and a proton .",
    "the signal in the @xmath31 invariant - mass distribution is about 115 mev below the expected mass of the @xmath31 system in case of non - bound @xmath32 absorption .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the finuda signal can also be explained by a @xmath33 reaction followed by final - state interactions ( fsi ) of the produced particles with the remnant nucleus .",
    "thus , it is obvious that further searches for bound kaonic nuclear states as well as new data on the interactions of @xmath21-mesons with light nuclei are of great interest .    in a recent paper  @xcite we presented a first calculation of the @xmath9-wave @xmath34 scattering length @xmath35 and discussed how to determine it from the @xmath34 invariant - mass distribution in the reaction @xmath36 near threshold . in the present paper",
    "we consider the @xmath37 fsi in the reaction @xmath38 and compare our calculations with the existing data on this reaction near threshold  @xcite .",
    "we also analyze the @xmath1 relative - energy distribution for this reaction and estimate possible contributions from the @xmath5 and @xmath6 resonances .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec:1 ] we calculate the @xmath39he and @xmath40 scattering lengths . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] an analysis of the @xmath39he fsi in the reaction @xmath41 is presented . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we analyze the differential @xmath1 distributions and discuss the possible contributions from the @xmath42 channels .",
    "our conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "in order to calculate the @xmath9-wave @xmath39he and @xmath34 scattering lengths and corresponding enhancement factors we use the multiple - scattering approach ( msa ) in the fixed center approximation described in detail in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "for the nuclear density we use a factorized model with the single - nucleon density in gaussian form @xmath43 where @xmath44 and 0.7  @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "note , that the independent particle model gives a rather good description of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 electromagnetic form factors up to a momentum transfer @xmath48  @xmath49 ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "some theoretical predictions for the @xmath50 and @xmath51 scattering lengths , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , have been published in refs .",
    "@xcite . in table",
    "[ tab3 ] we present new results calculated for different @xmath7 inputs as compared to refs .",
    "we consider the @xmath7 scattering lengths from a @xmath54-matrix fit ( set  1 )  @xcite as well as the predictions for the @xmath18 scattering amplitudes based on the chiral unitary approach of ref .",
    "@xcite ( set  2 ) .",
    "the constant scattering - length fit from conboy  @xcite is denoted as set  3 .",
    "we note that the @xmath18 scattering lengths described by sets  13 correspond to their vacuum values . at the same time",
    "sets  45 describe the effective @xmath18 scattering lengths that contain in - medium effects .",
    "one of the most extensive analyses of the effective @xmath7 interactions in nuclear medium has been presented by ramos and oset  @xcite within a self - consistent microscopic theory . the resulting @xmath24 attraction in medium",
    "has been found to be smaller than predicted by other theories and approximation schemes .",
    "the isospin - averaged effective @xmath7 scattering length is moderately attractive and its real part does not exceed the value of @xmath55 at nuclear density @xmath56 .",
    "the obtained shallow @xmath24-nucleus optical potential with a depth of @xmath57  mev ( for the real part of the potential at @xmath58 ) was successfully used to reproduce the experimental shifts and widths of kaonic atoms over the periodic table  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , akaishi and yamazaki  @xcite proposed much more attractive optical potential which corresponds to the following effective @xmath7 scattering lengths for the @xmath59 channels in the nuclear medium @xmath60 according to the akaishi and yamazaki approach , such a strong attraction appears already in the case of few - nucleon systems generating deeply bound @xmath61-nuclear states  @xcite .    in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of our results to possible modifications of the @xmath7 scattering amplitudes in the presence of nuclei we consider as set  4 the moderately attractive effective scattering length from ref .",
    "as set  5 we choose the strongly attractive in - medium solution found in refs .",
    "@xcite and given by eq.([ay ] ) .",
    "the calculated values of the @xmath35 and @xmath62 within the multiple - scattering theory are listed in the 5@xmath63 and 6@xmath63 columns of table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "they are very similar for sets 1 and 2 , @xmath64  fm and @xmath65  fm .",
    "the results for set  3 are quite different especially for the imaginary part of @xmath66 and the real part of @xmath67 . the calculations with the effective @xmath7 amplitude from ref .",
    "@xcite give the @xmath50 scattering length with an imaginary part roughly two times larger than the result obtained with the vacuum @xmath7 scattering lengths .",
    "not surprisingly , the exotic set  5 for the elementary amplitudes extracted from refs .",
    "@xcite leads to enormously large scattering lengths for @xmath50 and @xmath68 systems with real parts of @xmath69  fm and @xmath70  fm , respectively . in the case of the set  5 we also performed calculations using the single - nucleon density parameters in eq .",
    "( [ radiushe4 ] ) from ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath71  @xmath45 and 0.64  @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding results , presented in square brackets in table  [ tab3 ] , show a not very high sensitivity to the parameter @xmath72 .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we then compare the shape of the calculated spectra with that of the measured @xmath73 distribution .",
    "the solution without @xmath74 and @xmath75 resonances is in best agreement with the data with @xmath76 .",
    "the different curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] represent the relative contributions of the @xmath5 or @xmath6 meson versus the fraction of the @xmath77 meson obtained at @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath5 contribution might reach 2025% within a @xmath79 limit while that from the @xmath75 does not exceed @xmath80% of the total @xmath81 cross section at @xmath82  mev .    [ 0.85 ] [ 0.85 ]    to describe the momo data we just added the differential cross sections for the various channels , neglecting possible interference between the @xmath74- , @xmath75- and non - resonant contributions to the full @xmath83 amplitude .",
    "there is no simple way to calculate interference terms that depend on the spin structure and relative phases of different amplitudes .",
    "therefore , using the @xmath84 relative - energy spectrum one can only obtain qualitative estimates of the @xmath74 and @xmath75 resonance contributions .",
    "nevertheless we conclude that in the @xmath83 reaction near the threshold the @xmath1 pairs are mainly produced non - resonantly .",
    "we present predictions for the @xmath39he and @xmath50 scattering lengths obtained within the framework of the multiple - scattering approach .",
    "we have studied uncertainties of the calculations due to the presently available elementary @xmath85 scattering lengths .",
    "we have compared the results for @xmath52 with values obtained using the optical - potential model .",
    "we have also considered the @xmath86 and @xmath1 final - state interactions in the reaction @xmath87 near threshold and compare our model calculations with the existing data from the momo collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we find that a strongly modified @xmath88-effective scattering length extracted from the very attractive @xmath89 potential proposed by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite might lead to a pronounced deformations of the @xmath39he and @xmath1 relative - energy spectra which are in contradiction to the data .",
    "we also derive upper limits on the @xmath5- and @xmath6-production rates and find them to be on a level of about 25% for the @xmath74 and 10% for the @xmath75 at an excess energy of 41  mev .",
