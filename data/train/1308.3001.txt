    "magnetic systems with a broken parity and unbroken time - reversal symmetry , the chiral spin liquids , are predicted to possess excitations with unusual properties , like the anyon statistics  [ ] .",
    "spin liquids have been suggested to underpin the high - temperature superconductivity  [ ] and they have been extensively searched for  [ ] . on the other hand , the well known helical magnets demonstrate explicit parity violation in the ground state  [ ] . the usual path for a magnetic helix to form is via a single continuous phase transition  [ ] , where the chiral magnetic order develops . in two dimensions , villain has proposed  [ ] that the phase transition into a helix state can be split into two phase transitions , with the chiral , parity breaking phase transition taking place at a higher temperature , while the magnetic phase transition , breaking the time - reversal symmetry , taking place at a lower temperature . in between these two phase transitions a chiral spin liquid can exist  [ ] .",
    "there is a simple model on a square lattice with nearest and frustrating next - nearest exchange interactions  [ , ] , that has a helical ground state .",
    "the original study  [ ] and the follow - up study  [ ] of this simple model have indeed found the two phase transitions but in a usual sequence of events , i.e. , they have found ( incorrectly ) that the helical order develops from the already robust magnetic order when lowering the temperature , i.e. , the time - reversal phase transition takes place at a higher temperature than the parity - breaking phase transition .",
    "however , recent experiments  [ ] have found the reverse sequence of the two split phase transitions in a quasi - one - dimensional magnet , thus , validating the original villain s picture of an intermediate chiral spin liquid .",
    "this reverse sequence was also proposed as a hypothesis , without a proof , in the context of the one - dimensional quantum spin chains  [ ] . the same transition sequence , i.e. , chiral - bkt , is well established for a number of closely related models , e.g. , fully frustrated xy model  [ ] and xy triangular afm  [ ] .",
    "precisely the same model as considered in the present paper was recently studied by sorokin _ et al . _",
    "[ ] by classical monte carlo simulations .",
    "they find the same sequence of phase transitions as in the present analytical study , however , the universality class of the chiral phase transition is established different .",
    "although in the experiment  [ ] the magnetic phase transition has been determined to be of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type  [ ] , a few interesting questions about the chiral phase transition , like the critical exponents and the universality class , remained unanswered .    the substantial uncertainty on the phase diagram of the simplest helical magnet calls for a revisit of the garel and doniach model  [ ] .",
    "in this paper , we develop an accurate low - temperature expansion method suited for this model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two - dimensional two - component frustrated magnet defined microscopically on the square lattice depends on one parameter called helicity . applying our method for small helicity , in the long - range continuous approximation , we study thermodynamic phases and construct an accurate phase diagram in the plane of the temperature and the helicity parameter .",
    "one thermodynamic phase found is the chiral spin liquid .",
    "it has the scalar parity - breaking pitch of the magnetization , the vector otherwise random , as the order parameter .",
    "we find that the chiral phase transition proceeds directly from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "in this situation , the magnetization vector is destroyed by strong vortex fluctuations and we find a representation of the model in terms of the pitch - field only . using the wilson s renormalization group and the @xmath0-expansion analysis , we find that the chiral phase transition in the garel and doniach model falls in the same universality class as the ising model with long - range dipolar interactions  [ ] .",
