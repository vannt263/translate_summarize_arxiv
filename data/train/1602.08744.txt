    "in this article , we consider a class of homogeneous partial differential operators on a finite dimensional vector space and study their associated heat kernels .",
    "these operators , which we call nondegenerate - homogeneous operators , are seen to generalize the well - studied classes of semi - elliptic operators introduced by f. browder @xcite , also known as quasi - elliptic operators @xcite , and a special  positive \" subclass of semi - elliptic operators which appear as the spatial part of s. d. eidelman s @xmath0-parabolic operators @xcite . in particular , this class of operators contains all integer powers of the laplacian .      to motivate the definition of nondegenerate - homogeneous operators , given in the next section",
    ", we first introduce the class of semi - elliptic operators .",
    "semi - elliptic operators are seen to be prototypical examples of nondegenerate - homogeneous operators ; in fact , the definition of nondegenerate - homogeneous operators is given to formulate the following construction in a basis - independent way .",
    "given @xmath1-tuple of positive integers @xmath2 and a multi - index @xmath3 , set @xmath4 .",
    "consider the constant coefficient partial differential operator @xmath5 with principal part ( relative to @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 for each multi - index @xmath10 .",
    "such an operator @xmath11 is said to be _ semi - elliptic _ if the symbol of @xmath12 , defined by @xmath13 for @xmath14 , is non - vanishing away from the origin .",
    "if @xmath11 satisfies the stronger condition that @xmath15 is strictly positive away from the origin , we say that it is _ positive - semi - elliptic_. what seems to be the most important property of semi - elliptic operators is that their principal part @xmath12 is homogeneous in the following sense : if given any smooth function @xmath16 we put @xmath17 for all @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then @xmath20 for all @xmath18 .",
    "this homogeneous structure was used explicitly in the work of f. browder and l. hrmander and , in this article , we generalize this notion .",
    "we note that our definition for the differential operators @xmath21 is given to ensure a straightforward relationship between operators and symbols under our convention for the fourier transform ( defined in subsection [ subsec : preliminaries ] ) ; this definition differs only slightly from the standard references @xcite in which @xmath22 is replaced by @xmath23 . in both conventions , the symbol of the operator @xmath24 is the positive polynomial @xmath25 . in fact , the principal symbols of all positive - semi - elliptic operators agree in both conventions . +",
    "as mentioned above , the class of semi - elliptic operators was introduced by f. browder in @xcite who studied spectral asymptotics for a related class of variable - coefficient operators ( operators of constant strength ) .",
    "elliptic operators appeared later in l. hrmander s text @xcite as model examples of hypoelliptic operators on @xmath26 beyond the class of elliptic operators . around the same time ,",
    "l. r. volevich @xcite independently introduced the same class of operators but instead called them `` quasi - elliptic '' .",
    "since then , the theory of semi - elliptic operators , and hence quasi - elliptic operators , has reached a high level of sophistication and we refer the reader to the articles @xcite , which use the term semi - elliptic , and the articles @xcite , which use the term quasi - elliptic , for an account of this theory .",
    "we would also like to point to the 1971 paper of m. troisi @xcite which gives a more complete list of references ( pertaining to quasi - elliptic operators ) .",
    "+ shortly after f. browder s paper @xcite appeared , s. d. eidelman considered a subclass of semi - elliptic operators on @xmath27 ( and systems thereof ) of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the coefficients @xmath30 are functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "such an operator is said to be _",
    "@xmath33-parabolic _ if its spatial part , @xmath34 , is ( uniformly ) positive - semi - elliptic .",
    "we note however that eidelman s work and the existing literature refer exclusively to @xmath0-parabolic operators , i.e. , where @xmath35 , and for consistency we write @xmath0-parabolic henceforth @xcite . the relationship between positive - semi - elliptic operators and @xmath0-parabolic operators is analogous to the relationship between the laplacian and the heat operator and , in the context of this article , the relationship between nondegenerate - homogeneous and positive - homogeneous operators described by proposition [ prop : dichotomy ] .",
    "the theory of @xmath0-parabolic operators , which generalizes the theory of parabolic partial differential equations ( and systems ) , has seen significant advancement by a number of mathematicians since eidelman s original work .",
    "we encourage the reader to see the recent text @xcite which provides an account of this theory and an exhaustive list of references .",
    "it should be noted however that the literature encompassing semi - elliptic operators and quasi - elliptic operators , as far as we can tell , has very few cross - references to the literature on @xmath0-parabolic operators beyond the 1960s .",
    "we suspect that the absence of cross - references is due to the distinctness of vocabulary .",
    "+      we motivate the study of homogeneous operators by first demonstrating the natural appearance of their heat kernels in the study of convolution powers of complex - valued functions . to this end , consider a finitely supported function @xmath37 and define its convolution powers iteratively by @xmath38 for @xmath39 where @xmath40 . in the special case that @xmath41 is a probability distribution , i.e. , @xmath41 is non - negative and has unit mass , @xmath41 drives a random walk on @xmath36 whose nth - step transition kernels are given by @xmath42 . under certain mild conditions on the random walk , @xmath43 is well - approximated by a single gaussian density ; this is the classical local limit theorem .",
    "specifically , for a symmetric , aperiodic and irreducible random walk , the theorem states that @xmath44 uniformly for @xmath39 , where @xmath45 is the generalized gaussian density @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the positive definite covariance matrix associated to @xmath41 and @xmath48 denotes the dot product @xcite .",
    "the canonical example is that in which @xmath49 ( e.g. simple random walk ) and in this case @xmath43 is approximated by the so - called heat kernel @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 for @xmath18 and @xmath52 .",
    "indeed , we observe that @xmath53 for each positive integer @xmath54 and @xmath39 and so the local limit theorem is written equivalently as @xmath55 uniformly for @xmath39 .",
    "in addition to its natural appearance as the _ attractor _ in the local limit theorem above , @xmath56 is a fundamental solution to the heat equation @xmath57 on @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , this connection to random walk underlies the heat equation s probabilistic / diffusive interpretation . beyond the probabilistic",
    "setting , this link between convolution powers and fundamental solutions to partial differential equations persists as can be seen in the examples below . in what follows , the heat kernels @xmath59 are fundamental solutions to the corresponding heat - type equations of the form @xmath60 the appearance of @xmath61 in local limit theorems ( for @xmath43 ) is then found by evaluating @xmath62 at integer time @xmath63 and lattice point @xmath39 .",
    "[ ex : intro1 ] consider @xmath64 defined by @xmath65    analogous to the probabilistic setting , the large @xmath54 behavior of @xmath43 is described by a generalized local limit theorem in which the attractor is a fundamental solution to a heat - type equation . specifically , the following local limit theorem holds ( see @xcite for details ) : @xmath66 uniformly for @xmath67 where @xmath59 is the `` heat '' kernel for the heat - type equation @xmath68 where @xmath69 this local limit theorem is illustrated in figure [ fig : ex1_intro ] which shows @xmath70 and the approximation @xmath71 when @xmath72 .",
    "[ ex : intro2 ] consider @xmath73 defined by @xmath74 , where @xmath75    in this example , the following local limit theorem , which is illustrated by figure [ fig : ex2_intro ] , describes the limiting behavior of @xmath43 .",
    "we have @xmath76 uniformly for @xmath67 where @xmath61 is again a fundamental solution to @xmath68 where , in this case , @xmath77    [ ex : intro3 ] consider @xmath78 defined by @xmath79 here , the following local limit theorem is valid : @xmath80 uniformly for @xmath67 . here again , the attractor @xmath61 is the fundamental solution to @xmath68 where @xmath81    looking back at preceding examples , we note that the operators appearing in examples [ ex : intro1 ] and [ ex : intro2 ] are both positive - semi - elliptic and consist only of their principal parts .",
    "this is easily verified , for @xmath82 in example [ ex : intro1 ] and @xmath83 in example [ ex : intro2 ] .",
    "in contrast to examples [ ex : intro1 ] and [ ex : intro2 ] , the operator @xmath11 which appears in example [ ex : intro3 ] is not semi - elliptic in the given coordinate system . after careful study ,",
    "the @xmath11 appearing in example [ ex : intro3 ] can be written equivalently as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the directional derivative in the @xmath86 direction and @xmath87 is the directional derivative in the @xmath88 direction . in this way",
    ", @xmath11 is seen to be semi - elliptic with respect to some basis @xmath89 of @xmath90 and , with respect to this basis , we have @xmath91 .",
    "for this reason , our formulation of nondegenerate - homogeneous operators ( and positive - homogeneous operators ) , given in the next section , is made in a basis - independent way .",
    "+ all of the operators appearing in examples [ ex : intro1 ] , [ ex : intro2 ] and [ ex : intro3 ] share two important properties : homogeneity and positivity ( in the sense of symbols ) .",
    "while we make these notions precise in the next section , loosely speaking , homogeneity is the property that @xmath11 `` plays well '' with some dilation structure on @xmath26 , though this structure is different in each example .",
    "further , homogeneity for @xmath11 is reflected by an analogous one for the corresponding heat kernel @xmath61 ; in fact , the specific dilation structure is , in some sense , selected by @xmath43 as @xmath92 and leads to the corresponding local limit theorem . in further discussion of these examples ,",
    "a very natural question arises : given @xmath37 , how does one compute the operator @xmath11 whose heat kernel @xmath61 appears as the attractor in the local limit theorem for @xmath43 ? in the examples we have looked at ,",
    "one studies the taylor expansion of the fourier transform @xmath93 of @xmath41 near its local extrema and , here , the symbol of the relevant operator @xmath11 appears as certain scaled limit of this taylor expansion . in general , however , this is a very delicate business and , at present , there is no known algorithm to determine these operators .",
    "in fact , it is possible that multiple ( distinct ) operators can appear by looking at the taylor expansions about distinct local extrema of @xmath93 ( when they exist ) and , in such cases , the corresponding local limit theorems involve sums of of heat kernels  each corresponding to a distinct @xmath11 .",
    "this study is carried out in the article @xcite wherein local limit theorems involve the heat kernels of the positive - homoegeneous operators studied in the present article .",
    "we note that the theory presented in @xcite is not complete , for there are cases in which the associated taylor approximations yield symbols corresponding to operators @xmath11 which fail to be positive - homogeneous ( and hence fail to be positive - semi - elliptic ) and further , the heat kernels of these ( degenerate ) operators appear as limits of oscillatory integrals which correspond to the presence of  odd \" terms in @xmath11 , e.g. , the airy function . in one dimension , a complete theory of local limit theorems is known for the class of finitely supported functions @xmath94 . beyond one dimension ,",
    "a theory for local limit theorems of complex - valued functions , in which the results of @xcite will fit , remains open .",
    "+ the subject of this paper is an account of positive - homogeneous operators and their corresponding heat equations . in section [ sec : homogeneousoperators ] , we introduce positive - homogeneous operators and study their basic properties ; therein , we show that each positive - homogeneous operator is semi - elliptic in some coordinate system .",
