    ", it mainly relies on two fabrication strategies : one in which substrates bearing thousands of field - effect transistors ( fets ) are bonded to plastic by transfer printing or pick - and place methods@xcite ; another in which fets are prepared directly on the target substrate by several coating , curing and lithographic steps@xcite .",
    "rubber stamping@xcite , embossing@xcite and ink - jet printing@xcite reduce the number of such fabrication steps .",
    "ink - jet printing is one of the most promising techniques for large area fabrication of flexible plastic electronics@xcite .",
    "a range of components can be printed , such as transistors@xcite , photovoltaic devices@xcite , organic light emitting diodes ( oleds)@xcite , and displays@xcite .",
    "ink - jet printing is versatile@xcite , involves a limited number of process steps@xcite , is amenable for mass production , and can deposit controlled amounts of material@xcite .",
    "drop on demand@xcite ink - jet printing has progressed from printing text and graphics@xcite , to a tool for rapid manufacturing@xcite , being now an established technique to print thin film transistor ( tft ) based on organic conducting and semiconducting inks@xcite . however , their mobilities , @xmath6@xmath70.5@xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2,@xcite are still much lower than standard silicon technology .",
    "several approaches aim to improve this , such as the use of polysilicon@xcite , zinc oxide nanoparticles@xcite and carbon nanotubes ( cnts)@xcite .",
    "metal nanoparticle inks are not stable in ordinary solvents , such as deionized ( di ) water , acetone , isopropyl alcohol , n - methylpyrrolidone ( nmp ) , tetrahydrofuran@xcite .",
    "they need to be chemically modified in order to be dispersed@xcite , using stabilizers , which usually degrade in a couple of years@xcite .",
    "metal nanoparticles also tend to oxidize after printing@xcite .",
    "ink - jet printed cnt - tfts have been reported with @xmath6 up to 50@xmath1 v@xmath2s@xmath2 and a on / off ratio@xmath010@xmath8.@xcite    graphene is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) building block for @xmath9 carbon allotropes of every other dimensionality . it can be stacked into 3d graphite , rolled into 1d nanotubes , or wrapped into 0d fullerenes@xcite .",
    "it is at the centre of an ever expanding research area@xcite .",
    "near - ballistic transport and high mobility make it an ideal material for nanoelectronics , especially for high frequency applications@xcite .",
    "furthermore , its optical and mechanical properties are ideal for micro and nanomechanical systems , thin - film transistors , transparent and conductive composites and electrodes , and photonics@xcite .",
    "graphene was isolated by micromechanical exfoliation of graphite@xcite .",
    "this technique is still the best in terms of purity , defects , mobility and optoelectronics properties .",
    "however , large scale production approaches are needed for widespread application .",
    "these encompass growth by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd)@xcite , segregation by heat treatment of silicon carbide@xcite and metal substrates@xcite , liquid phase exfoliation ( lpe)@xcite . amongst these",
    ", lpe is ideally suited to produce printable inks .",
    "graphite can be exfoliated by chemical wet dispersion followed by ultrasonication , both in aqueous@xcite and non - aqueous solvents@xcite .",
    "dispersions can be achieved by mild sonication in water with sodium deoxycholate , followed by sedimentation based - ultracentrifugation@xcite .",
    "bile salt surfactants also allow the isolation of flakes with controlled thickness , when combined with density gradient ultracentrifugation ( dgu)@xcite . exfoliation of graphite intercalated compounds@xcite and expandable graphite@xcite was also reported .",
    "lpe was first achieved through sonication of graphite oxide@xcite , following the hummers method@xcite .",
    "the oxidation of graphite in the presence of acids and oxidants@xcite disrupts the sp@xmath10-network and introduces hydroxyl or epoxide groups@xcite , with carboxylic or carbonyl groups attached to the edge@xcite .",
    "these make graphene oxide ( go ) sheets readily dispersible in water@xcite and several other solvents@xcite .",
    "although large go flakes can be produced , these are intrinsically defective@xcite , and electrically insulating@xcite .",
    "despite several attempts@xcite , reduced go ( rgo ) does not fully regain the pristine graphene electrical conductivity@xcite .",
    "it is thus important to distinguish between dispersion processed graphene flakes@xcite , retaining the electronic properties of graphene , and insulating go dispersions@xcite .",
    "several groups reported go - based inks@xcite . ref .",
    "ink - jet printed rgo films for sensors applications , while ref .",
    "produced rgo - stabilized cu nanoparticles as low temperature metal colloids , to replace standard metal nanoparticle inks , that require high temperature sintering postprocessing@xcite .",
    "mobilities up to 90@xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 have been achieved for highly reduced go films by ink - jet printing@xcite , with an on / off ratio up to 10.@xcite    here we produce a graphene - based ink and demonstrate its viability for printed electronics .",
    "a key property of inks viable for printing is their ability to generate droplets@xcite .",
    "ink viscosity , @xmath11 [ mpa s ] , surface tension , @xmath12 [ mj m@xmath13 , density , @xmath14 [ g @xmath15 , and nozzle diameter , @xmath16 [ @xmath6 m ] , influence the spreading of the liquid drops@xcite .",
    "these parameters can be arranged into dimensionless figures of merit ( fom ) , such as the reynolds ( re)@xcite , weber ( we)@xcite , and ohnesorge ( oh)@xcite numbers : re=@xmath17 ; we=@xmath18 , oh=@xmath19 , where @xmath20[m / s ] is the drop velocity .    refs . suggested to use z=1/oh as the appropriate fom to characterize drop formation , 1@xmath7z@xmath714 being required to get stable drop generation@xcite .",
    "for z@xmath71 the high viscosity prevents drop ejection@xcite , whereas at z@xmath2114 the primary drop is accompanied by a number of satellite droplets@xcite .",
    "moreover , when inks contain dispersed molecules or nano - particles , the latter should be smaller than the nozzle diameter , to prevent clogging@xcite . refs . suggested that the size of such molecules or particles should be at least 1/50 of the nozzle diameter , in order to exclude any printing instability , such as clustering of the particles at the nozzle edge , which may deviate the drop trajectory , or result in agglomerates that will eventually block the nozzle .",
    "the ejected drop behavior on the substrate can be efficiently described by fluid dynamics .",
    "when a small liquid droplet is in contact with a flat surface , partial wetting results in a finite angle between the liquid and the substrate@xcite , known as contact angle , @xmath22@xcite .",
    "the lower drop size limit is given by@xcite @xmath23=a\\sqrt{\\frac{we+12}{3(1-cos\\theta_{c})+4we / re^{1/2}}}$ ] .",
    "thus , e.g. , for a typical @xmath16=50@xmath6 m , @xmath24=20 , @xmath25=58 and @xmath22@xmath045@xmath26 , we get @xmath27@xmath085 - 90@xmath6 m .",
    "the distance from the substrate must be optimized to guarantee both homogeneous printing and the highest resolution , barring any unusual jetting conditions , such as perturbations from the surrounding environment and diversion of the drop trajectory@xcite . furthermore",
    ", a substrate very close to the nozzle causes secondary drops to scatter off during the impact of the primary drop@xcite , due to the initial drop jetting pressure , thus affecting the homogeneity of the final printed features@xcite .",
    "the final assembly of printed nano - particle inks depends on the substrate surface energy ( se)@xcite , as well as the ink viscosity and surface tension@xcite .",
    "when a drop of an ink containing dispersed particles evaporates on a surface it commonly leaves a dense , ring - like , deposit along its perimeter@xcite .",
    "this is the so - called `` coffee ring effect''@xcite , i.e. a distortion of the drops during solvent drying due to the interplay of ink viscosity and solute transport via solvent motion ( arising from surface tension interaction between solvent and substrate)@xcite .",
    "this is one of the most important phenomena affecting the homogeneity of ink - jet printed drops@xcite . in order to prevent this ,",
    "it is necessary to `` freeze '' the drops geometry immediately after they form an homogeneous and continuous film on the substrate@xcite .",
    "here we use an ink - jet printer with a nozzle diameter@xmath050@xmath6 m , thus we need to have flakes less than 1@xmath6 m across . by tuning @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath14 we will target a z within the optimal range .",
    "we print on si / sio@xmath28 ( to probe the electrical properties of the ink ) and borosilicate ( pyrex 7740-polished prime grade ) glass substrates ( to test the ink as transparent conductor ) , both with a roughness r@xmath29@xmath715 nm . our aim is to obtain ink - jet printed drops on the substrate , with homogeneous flakes and uniform morphology , i.e. with roughness comparable to the substrate .",
    "we obtain this by varying the contact angle and optimizing the substrate wettability .    in order to reduce the coffee ring effect",
    "we need both a solvent with boiling point ( t@xmath30 [ @xmath26c ] ) and heat of vaporization ( v@xmath30 [ kj / mol ] ) higher than water@xcite , and a substrate that promotes adhesion@xcite .",
    "thus , we use nmp as solvent for two main reasons .",
    "first , it has higher boiling point ( @xmath0202@xmath26c)@xcite and heat of vaporization ( 54.5kj / mol)@xcite , than water ( @xmath0100@xmath26c and @xmath040kj / mol ) .",
    "second , nmp is the best solvent to get high - yield , surfactant - free exfoliation of graphite@xcite .",
    "we then test several surface treatments to optimize substrate adhesion . after printing ,",
    "nmp is removed by thermal annealing at 170@xmath26c for 5 minutes .",
    "we prepare the graphene - based printable ink as follows .",
    "graphite flakes ( ngs naturgraphit ) are sonicated ( decon bath , 100w ) in nmp for 9 hours .",
    "the un - exfoliated flakes are left to settle for 10 mins after sonication .",
    "the decanted dispersions are then ultracentrifuged using a th-641 swinging bucket rotor in a sorvall wx-100 ultra - centrifuge at 10,000 rpm ( @xmath015,000 g ) for an hour and filtered to remove flakes@xmath211@xmath6 m , that might clog the nozzle .",
    "the resulting ink is characterized by optical absorption spectroscopy ( oas ) , high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) , electron diffraction and raman spectroscopy .",
    "absorbance of graphene - ink .",
    "the inset is a picture of a vial of ink.,width=302 ]    a perkin - elmer lambda 950 spectrometer with 1 nm resolution is used for oas measurements .",
    "oas can be used to estimate the concentration of graphene@xcite using the beer - lambert law according to the relation @xmath31 , where a is the absorbance , l [ m ] is the light path length , c [ g / l ] the concentration of dispersed graphitic material and @xmath32 [ l g@xmath2 m@xmath2 ] the absorption coefficient .",
    "fig.[absorption ] plots an oas spectrum of our ink diluted to 10% .",
    "the ink is diluted to avoid strong scattering losses at higher concentrations , which could cause deviation of the measured value of a from the beer - lambert law .",
    "the spectrum in fig.[absorption ] is mostly featureless , as expected due to the linear dispersion of the dirac electrons@xcite , the peak in the uv region being a signature of the van hove singularity in the graphene density of states@xcite . from @xmath341390lg@xmath2m@xmath2 at 660 nm , as for refs . , we estimate c@xmath00.11@xmath350.02g / l .     a , b ) hrtem image and diffraction pattern of a dispersed slg flake .",

    "it shows the expected sixfold symmetry@xcite .",
    "the peaks are labeled with the corresponding miller - bravais ( hkil ) indexes . for few layer gaphene ( flg )",
    "flakes with bernal ( ab ) stacking , the intensity ratio @xmath36 is@xmath71 , while for slg @xmath37@xmath211@xcite .",
    "we use this to distinguish slg from flgs@xcite .",
    "fig.[tem]c plots the diffraction intensity measured along the line section through the ( 1@xmath3810 ) , ( 0@xmath3910 ) , ( @xmath39010 ) , ( @xmath38110 ) axis , reported in fig.[tem]b . the inner peaks , ( 0@xmath3910 ) and ( @xmath39010 ) , are@xmath01.5 times the outer ones , ( 1@xmath3810 ) and ( @xmath38110 ) , indicating that the flake is slg@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the edges also gives a reliable information on the number of layers and can be used to investigate a large number of flakes@xcite , from zoomed - in high resolution edge images@xcite .",
    "if slg folds or several slgs stack one on the other , selected area diffraction is used to distinguish contentious cases .",
    "these combined analysis show that our ink mostly consists of slgs , bi - layers ( blg ) and flgs , with lateral size@xmath0300 - 1000 nm .",
    "we find that@xmath035% slgs are larger than 300 nm ( fig.[tem]d);@xmath040% blgs are larger than 350 nm ( fig.[tem]e);@xmath055% flgs are larger than 450 nm ( fig.[tem]f ) . in particular , we have@xmath033% slg with c@xmath00.11g / l .",
    "previous works on lpe of graphite in nmp reported up to@xmath028% slg for c@xmath00.18g / l@xcite and @xmath021% for c@xmath01.8g / l@xcite .",
    "ref . also reported exfoliation of intercalated graphite in nmp , with@xmath020% slgs for c@xmath00.01g / l .",
    "thus , our ink has higher slg yield with respect to previous works , but lower c than ref .. this higher c was achieved by long time ( up to 460h ) ultrasonication@xcite .",
    "however ref . reported defects and reduction of size as a result .",
    "our combination of low - power sonication ( @xmath725w ) and ultracentrifugation is ideal for high - yield of defect - free slgs .",
    "stable dispersions require the gibbs free energy of mixing , @xmath40 , to be zero or negative@xcite , where @xmath41 , k being the temperature , @xmath42 the enthalpy of mixing and and @xmath43 the entropy change in the mixing process@xcite . for graphene and nanotubes , @xmath43 is small@xcite .",
    "therefore , for dispersion and stabilization of graphene in solvents , @xmath42 needs to be very small .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing a solvent whose surface energy is very close to that of graphene@xcite .",
    "the surface energy of nmp satisfies this requirement and allows efficient exfoliation of graphite .",
    "graphite can also be efficiently exfoliated in water with the use of bile salt surfactants .",

    "reported@xmath060% slgs for c@xmath00.012g / l .",
    "the yield can be increased up to@xmath080% by density gradient ultracentrifugation@xcite .",
    "the flake size of lpe graphene in water - surfactant dispersions is on average smaller(@xmath0200nm@xcite , @xmath030nm@xcite ) than thus far reported for nmp(@xmath01@xmath6m@xcite ) .",
    "the viscosity at room temperature of nmp ( 1.7mpas@xcite ) is higher than water ( @xmath01mpas@xcite ) .",
    "larger flakes in a higher viscosity medium ( such as nmp ) experience higher frictional force@xcite and sedimentation coefficient@xcite , making it more difficult for them to sediment during ultracentrifugation .",
    "this reduces the slg yield in nmp compared to water .",
    "the centrifuged dispersions are drop - cast onto a si wafer with 300 nm thermally grown sio@xmath28 ( ldb technologies ltd . ) and annealed at 170@xmath26c to remove nmp .",
    "these samples are then used for raman measurements , collected with a renishaw 1000 at 457 , 514.5 and 633 nm and a 100@xmath44 objective , with an incident power@xmath01mw .",
    "fig.[raman]a plots a typical raman spectrum of the ink at 514.5 nm .",
    "besides the g and 2d peaks , it shows significant d and d intensities and the combination mode d+d@xmath02950cm@xmath2 .",
    "the g peak corresponds to the e@xmath46 phonon at the brillouin zone centre .",
    "the d peak is due to the breathing modes of sp@xmath10 rings and requires a defect for its activation by double resonance ( dr)@xcite .",
    "the 2d peak is the second order of the d peak .",
    "this is a single band in slg@xcite , whereas it splits in four in blg , reflecting the evolution of the band structure@xcite .",
    "the 2d peak is always seen , even when no d peak is present , since no defects are required for the activation of two phonons with the same momentum , one backscattering from the other@xcite .",

    "this is further supported by the plot of the g peak dispersion , disp(g)(fig.[raman]b ) ) .",
    "this is defined as disp(g)=@xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the laser excitation wavelength .",
    "disp(g ) is generated from the linear fit the plot of the g peak position , pos(g ) , as a function of the laser excitation wavelength . in disordered carbons",
    "pos(g ) increases as the excitation wavelength decreases , from ir to uv@xcite , thus disp(g ) increases with disorder@xcite .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the g peak , fwhm(g ) , always increases with disorder@xcite .",
    "thus , combining the intensity ration of the d and g peaks , i(d)/i(g ) , with fwhm(g ) and disp(g ) allows us to discriminate between disorder localized at the edges , and disorder in the bulk of the samples . in the latter case , to higher i(d)/i(g ) would correspond higher fwhm(g ) and disp(g ) .",
    "figs.[raman2 ] a , b ) show that disp(g ) , i(d)/i(g ) and fwhm(g ) are not correlated , a clear indication that the major contribution to the d peak comes from the sample edges .",
    "also , disp(g ) is nearly zero for all samples , compared to the values bigger than 0.1cm@xmath2/nm expected for disordered carbons@xcite , another indication of the lack of large structural disorder within our flakes .",
    "the distribution of 2d peak positions , pos(2d ) , shown in [ raman]d , has two maxima@xmath02692 and 2705cm@xmath2 , similar to fwhm(2d ) ( [ raman]e ) .",
    "this is consistent with the samples being a distribution of slg , blg and flgs , but with a significant fraction of slgs .",
    "we note that for the flakes with the smallest pos(2d ) and fwhm(2d ) , the ration of the 2d and g integrated areas , a(2d)/a(g ) , is at most 3.5 , implying a doping of at least 10@xmath49@xmath50.@xcite    we now estimate @xmath11 , @xmath14 and @xmath12 for our ink , in order to check its viability for ink - jet printing .",
    "@xmath11 can be evaluated as @xmath51(1 + 2.5@xmath52)@xcite , where @xmath53 is the viscosity of the pure solvent and @xmath52 the volume fraction of particles in the dispersion .",
    "we assume @xmath540.8mpas , the viscosity of pure nmp at @xmath080@xmath26c@xcite ( the temperature of the drops ejected from our printer , as specified in ref . ) . we take @xmath52=1-@xmath55 , where vol@xmath56 [ @xmath00.972 mm@xmath8 ] is the volume of 1 mg pure nmp and vol@xmath58 [ @xmath00.94 mm@xmath8 ] is the volume of 1 mg of our ink , both measured by a micropipette ( @xmath352nl precision ) , at room temperature and pressure .",
    "we thus get @xmath590.03 , and @xmath600.96mpas . from the same measurement",
