    "obscuration of starlight by interstellar dust grains is a serious obstacle which hampers our ability to directly derive stellar population properties of galaxies from observed radiative information .",
    "correction for dust attenuation is crucial for determining galactic properties such as star formation history ( sfh ) in current extragalactic astronomy .",
    "calibration of observational indicators to intrinsic parameters of galaxies , for instance from observed uv - optical flux to star formation rate ( sfr ) , is in tight connection with the fact of proper compensation made for dust attenuation .",
    "dust grains absorb stellar emission with the wavelength coverage from far - ultraviolet to near - infrared , and re - emit the energy as mid- and far - infrared thermal radiation . according to the energy balance theory ,",
    "the luminosity ratio of total infrared ( ir ) to ultraviolet has been invented and considered as a reliable indicator of dust attenuation . throughout this paper ,",
    "the irx is defined in the form of a logarithm : @xmath1 , where l(ir ) is luminosity of infrared thermal radiation of dust and l(fuv ) is far - ultraviolet monochromatic luminosity of starlight ( detailed definitions of these terms are presented in section [ measure ] ) . in the meanwhile , for starburst galaxies",
    ", it is believed that the ultraviolet spectral slope ( @xmath0 , defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ; * ? ? ? * ) has an intrinsic value ( @xmath4 , as suggested in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and any change in this slope results from wavelength - selective absorption of photons by dust grains . on a basis of this assumption ,",
    "the slope of uv spectrum is regarded as another attenuation estimator @xcite .",
    "the correlation between the two parameters was found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* so - called irx-@xmath0 relation ) with an investigation based on a local starburst sample , and the relation was believed to be a sequence indicating dust attenuation .",
    "therefore , the irx-@xmath0 relation has great significance for attenuation correction , since it provides an access to estimate dust attenuation solely with uv waveband .",
    "this prescription has been widely used at the present time especially for high redshift galaxies , of which the rest - frame uv observations are available from ground - based optical telescopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since people usually adopt uv color or uv luminosity ratio as a surrogate for the traditional uv spectral slope , hereafter we refer to the relation as the terminology `` irx - uv '' in place of the `` irx-@xmath0 '' .",
    "observations on extragalactic star - forming regions and normal galaxies following the discovery of the irx - uv relation show considerable dispersion in this relation .",
    "the analysis of hii regions in the large magellanic cloud by @xcite and the study of normal galaxies by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter denoted as k04 ) have shown that the irx - uv relation appears to have flatter uv spectral slopes than starburst galaxies at fixed irx and covers a wide range ; the tight correlation between irx and @xmath0 for starburst galaxies has been found in absence , with a considerable degree of deviation and dispersion from the starburst formula instead .    following the launch of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ spitzer _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an increasing number of studies have revealed the deviation in the irx - uv relation , from statistics of integrated measurements of galaxies as a whole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to spatially resolved studies of individual galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is worth mentioning that , with the combination of larger and more comprehensive uv and ir all sky survey data , @xcite have found the similar offset and scatter from the starburst relation in the irx - uv diagram , while a few number of ir - bright galaxies appear to have higher irxs than starburst galaxies at given uv spectral slopes .",
    "the irx - rising phenomenon has been confirmed by studies of ( ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies , and adds an additional question to the irx - uv issue @xcite .",
    "in order to improve the irx - uv calibration to dust attenuation and to provide better insights into the nature of galactic uv and ir properties , it is necessary to discover the origin of the deviation in the irx - uv relation .",
    "a variety of sfh of different stellar populations have been considered as one main cause of the deviation , and in simple cases this deviation is indicated by stellar population age . in k04 work , the authors have compiled a sample of galaxies with a wide coverage of star formation activities from starburst to quiescent , and employed the spectral index @xmath5 to trace different stellar populations . via the analysis of perpendicular distances of the galaxies on the irx - uv diagram from the empirical best - fitting curve for starburst galaxies",
    "( the starburst empirical curve is parameterized by equation ( 2 ) in k04 paper ) , they have confirmed that variations in stellar populations dominate the dispersion in the irx - uv relation .",
    "the products of stellar population synthesis modeling in k04 work have shown that aging of stellar populations would yield redder unattenuated uv colors ( i.e. , flatter intrinsic uv spectral slopes ) , and the effect of stellar population age on the irx - uv relation is depicted as a series of sequences in parallel with the starburst empirical relation ( figure 4 in k04 paper ) . thus , in addition to dust attenuation , stellar population age has been considered as the second parameter in the irx - uv function .",
    "nevertheless , there has been lack of strong evidence to demonstrate such an age effect , and in many cases it is ascribed to the fact that the adopted observational tracers are inappropriate , or the age effects are weak compared with other potential effects and hence can be easily masked @xcite . despite these disappointments , studies of radial profiles for individual galaxies have disclosed a weak trend of the age - sensitive color fuv @xmath6 3.6 @xmath7 m in the irx - uv relation , which is in encouraging support of the role stellar population age plays in the irx - uv relation @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , the radial profiles still can not adequately resolve the mixing of stellar populations within galaxies .    a recent work on a basis of pixel - by - pixel studies of nearby galaxies taken by makes use of the data obtained from the _ herschel space observatory _ to examine a set of parameters .",
    "the results in their work have illustrated that , intrinsic uv color plays a predominant role in the irx - uv relation ; the commonly used age indicators including the spectral index @xmath5 are in a poor position to estimate accurate stellar population age and therefore fail to trace the irx - uv relation as a function of age ; in addition , the analysis in has further predicted a non - negligible contribution from the shape of attenuation law to the deviation in the irx - uv relation . coincidentally",
    ", several numerical simulations have reproduced a diversity of irx - uv trends by varying dust - star geometrical configuration and dust grain properties @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we carry out spatially resolved studies of galaxies which enable an inspection of galactic sub - structures and allow us to extract certain sources of interest within each single galaxy rather than a mixture of different stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in this way we can have better separation between different populations than integrated measurements or radial profiles of galaxies .",
    "this kind of investigation also makes it possible to compare regions of a similar stellar population in different galaxies .",
    "@xcite have been engaged in a census of star - forming clusters in eight nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "further to the approach taken by @xcite , we focus on all positions in galaxies , not only young clusters , but also evolved stellar populations in galactic background areas which are supposed to have different intrinsic uv colors from young stellar populations . this strategy is a natural way to define stellar populations and makes it possible to exhibit age signatures in the irx - uv diagrams . up to now , most analyses are based on integrated measurements of galaxies , while in this work , we take advantage of the spatially resolved analysis to explore the determinant of the locations of integrated galaxies in the irx - uv diagram .",
    "also , we test the systematic dependence of the irx - uv relation on fuv luminosity and radial distance , and present two - dimensional maps of uv color and irx to provide a spatial insight into the irx - uv relation .    the remainder of this paper is outlined as follows . in section [ data ] , we describe the compilation of the sample , the data processing and the photometric measurements , and the modeling of spectral synthesis ; in section [ result1 ] , we present the resulting irx - uv diagrams for the extracted regions within the galaxies in our sample ; in section [ result2 ] , we examine the systematic dependance of the irx - uv relations on luminosity and radial distance ; in section [ 2-d map ] , we provide spatial distributions of uv color and irx ; section [ disc ] is concerned with relevant discussion and interpretation about the presented results ; finally , we summarize the results and their implications in section [ sum ] .",
    "the sample of galaxies in this work is compiled from the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings , * ? ? ?",

    "the approach of this work is to measure all positions within individual galaxies , and divide various stellar populations thereinto . for this purpose ,",
    "large spiral galaxies containing a sufficient number of well - resolved subregions are required as targets ; on the other hand , in order to investigate distributions of galaxies in the irx - uv diagram , we need a sample of galaxies with a diversity of the irx - uv locations .",
    "taking the two criteria into consideration , we select five galaxies from sings galaxy sample : ngc  3031 ( m81 ) , ngc  4536 , ngc  5194 ( m51a ) , ngc  6946 , and ngc  7331 .",

    "this galaxy - dependent scale is determined by two criteria : the window size should be large enough to enclose sufficient background pixels in the flux - peak - masked images , and in the meanwhile the window can not extend beyond local areas .",
    "in this situation , we define the final window size as a compromise by manual adjustment . by means of this approach",

    "the assumption of an instantaneous burst is a simplified account for stellar populations contained in galactic subregions , and this scenario of simple stellar populations highlights the age signature in the irx - uv function .",
    "however , in view of any possible variation in sfh within the measured regions inside galaxies , descriptions with such a scenario are not sufficient to make realistic estimates of age .",
    "we will discuss more complex sfhs by adopting scenarios of composite stellar populations in section [ disc ] .",
    "all the modeled stellar population spectra are charged with a series of dust attenuation , and in this procedure we employ the starburst attenuation law ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter denoted as c00 ) to produce such attenuation with @xmath27 .",
    "dust attenuation and stellar population age are the variables in the products of modeling .",
    "c00 starburst attenuation law is based on the same sample as fitted with k04 empirical relation , and the reproduced irx - uv curves are an extension of k04 empirical curve in the age space , i.e. , the irx - uv relation with age as the second parameter . in this way , we establish an irx - uv function with two parameters : dust attenuation and stellar population age , for the purpose of comparison with observational data .",
    "it is possible for attenuation law to vary with different environments , and the application of a common attenuation law to different galaxies and different galactic subregions aims at simplicity . in the second paper of this series ( paper ii , ye - wei mao et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) , we will focus on the issue of the irx - uv properties related to attenuation / extinction law .    by convolving the modeled spectra with transmission curves of the _ galex _ fuv and nuv filters , we obtain fuv and nuv luminosities , and @xmath19 colors ;",
    "the total ir luminosity in the modeling is calculated as a sum of all the attenuated stellar emission , on a basis of the energy balance assumption that the attenuated starlight is re - emitted by interstellar dust as ir continuum of a equal amount . as a result",
    "we reproduce the irx - uv relation as a function of stellar population age .",
    "with the measurements described above , in this section , we analyze the irx - uv diagrams for the galaxies in our sample : ngc  3031 , ngc  4536 , ngc  5194 , ngc  6946 , and ngc  7331 .",

    "we can see that the data points in each plot compose a continuous locus and spread in a redder @xmath19 color range or a lower irx level than k04 starburst empirical reference . in the following subsections , we present respective descriptions for these galaxies .     for ngc  3031 with the relational curves reproduced by c00",

    "blue filled triangles symbolize the uv clusters ( the blue circles in figure [ aper_m81 ] ) , green open circles represent the local background regions in disk area ( the green circles in figure [ aper_m81 ] ) , and red open circles depict the local background regions regions in bulge area ( the red circles in figure [ aper_m81 ] ) .",

    "square symbolizes the disk part of the galaxy , and the brown filled star presents the integrated galaxy with fluxes cited from the d07 paper .",
    "black dashed lines describe the model curves sampled with five ages : 2 , 8 , 100 , 300 , and 500 myr , from left to right on the horizontal axis .",
    "dotted lines connect the points of five constant amounts of dust attenuation ( @xmath28 = 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , and 2.0 ) on the model curves of different ages .",
    "grey dot - dashed line is k04 starburst curve .",
    "error bars showing the photometric uncertainties are plotted as well . ]      for ngc  3031 , we divide the measured subregions into three populations : uv clusters , disk background regions , and bulge background regions , representing young , evolved , and the oldest populations in this galaxy , respectively , as described in the above section .",
    "figure [ irxuv_uv_m81 ] shows the irx - uv distributions for the three populations , the integrated galaxy , and the integrated bulge , with k04 empirical curve and the c00-attenuation - modeled curves for constant ages superimposed .",
    "the locus composed of all the data points presents a large departure from k04 empirical curve , and appears to have flatter irxs with increasing @xmath19 colors .",
    "the most remarkable feature in this figure is the clear separation of different populations .",
    "most of the data points populate in the irx range between 0.0 and 1.0 , but the different populations appear to lie in possession of their own uv color ranges : the uv clusters occupy the @xmath19 range between -0.3 and 0.2 mag , the disk background regions spread in the @xmath19 range of 0.2@xmath60.7 mag , and the bulge background regions extend from 0.7 to 1.8 mag in @xmath19 , and are thus embedded in the reddest zone of the panel .",
    "the population classification enables us to obviously see the increasing perpendicular distances from the starburst empirical curve with aging of stellar populations , and this behavior is in rough similarity to k04 prediction .",
    "the separation of different populations provides a robust interpretation of the wide spread of the data points with the effects of stellar population age .    in figure [ irxuv_uv_m81 ]",
    ", we overplot the irx - uv curves at five certain stellar population ages : 2 myr , 8 myr , 100 myr , 300 myr , and 500 myr , reproduced by the two - parameter modeling . in the diagram",
    ", the modeled curves are displayed in parallel with k04 empirical line , and the 8 myr - age curve overlaps well with this empirical line . with stellar populations evolving , the relevant irx - uv curves shift towards redder @xmath19 colors , due to the inherently red uv colors of evolved stellar populations .",
    "we also connect constant dust attenuation on each age - fixed curve , and the tracks appear to be slightly steeper than horizontal ( see the dotted lines in figure [ irxuv_uv_m81 ] ) , which shows that irx is not perfectly independent on age .",
    "the curves at fixed age and the tracks of constant dust attenuation are in agreement with the model products from the same attenuation law in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the modeled grid illustrates clearly the behaviors of dust attenuation and age parameters in the irx - uv function .",
    "the model here is based on the sfh of an instantaneous burst , and section [ disc ] will present the cases of more complex sfhs .",

    "these uncertainties have a very trivial influence on the irx - uv relation . nevertheless , if there is any significant variation in extinction law at the low galactic latitude , fuv and nuv extinctions are likely to be biased for such a high level of @xmath16 .",
    "it is shown in table [ contri ] that , at each waveband the total luminosity of the uv clusters accounts for 20%@xmath625% of the integrated luminosity of the galaxy , and a considerable amount of integrated emission of the galaxy comes from the galactic background ; similar to ngc  5194 , the center area of ngc  6946 presents no prominent feature , and the contribution of the center to the integrated measurements of the galaxy is insignificant .",

    "this finding brings forward a caveat that in the sampling process the preferential selection of bright sources has the potential to omit a certain section of low luminosities in the whole distribution of this relation .",
    "in addition , roughly declining radial profiles of irx and @xmath19 have been found in galaxies @xcite .",

    "we take this galaxy as an example to show the luminosity and radial distance trends in figure [ irxuv_2_m81 ] .",
    "the left panel of the figure presents the luminosity trend in the irx - uv relation .",
    "the regions with high fuv luminosity appear to have low irxs and blue uv colors , and the low fuv objects are located in the range with relatively large values of irx and @xmath19 .",
    "the inconsistency to the studies of integrated galaxies is due to different natures of the targets in the respective work . in the integrated results , most of the fuv - brighter objects close to the starburst empirical relation are starburst or star - forming galaxies , while dwarf and irregular galaxies with faint luminosities and low irx make up the bottom part of the diagram due to their low mass and dust - poor state @xcite . in our work ,",
    "the regions with low fuv luminosity are defined as dust - rich sources or evolved stellar populations with large infrared - to - ultraviolet ratios and red colors , and therefore located at the top part of the diagram ; whereas the strong uv emission arises from dust - poor regions and young clusters which lead to the declining trends of the irx and @xmath19 .",
    "the radial dependance of the irx - uv relation is shown at the right panel of the figure .",
    "it is apparent that the both parameters in the relation decrease at larger radii , in accordance with the studies of galactic radial profiles @xcite . for ngc  3031 ,",
    "the apparent trend is better indicated by the disk - bulge separation : the central bulge contains the oldest populations in the galaxy with intrinsically low fuv luminosity and short radial distance .",
    "in order to scan the spatial distributions of @xmath19 color and irx with clear circumstance , we plot the two - dimensional maps of the two parameters for each galaxy in figures [ maps_m81]@xmath6[maps_ngc7331 ] . in each figure ,",
    "the highest values of the @xmath19 color is in the center , and at larger radii the value decreases finally falling to the minimum at the galactic edge .",
    "the irx presents the similar descending gradient to the uv color but a differentiation in pattern .",
    "there is no obvious fluctuation of the @xmath19 along galactic radii , and the color change along the radius is quite smooth ; whereas on the irx maps we can clearly see spiral arm - like structures , and in addition , the inner parts of spiral arms seem to exhibit higher irxs than the outer parts in some cases .",
    "this feature is more obvious in the face - on galaxies ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 , and ngc  6946 . although the edge - on galaxies fail to illuminate the same details , in our sample ngc  4536 still exhibits the central clump and ngc  7331 displays the ring structure in centers on their respective irx maps .",
    "the diversity in the spatial distributions between uv color and irx can be elucidated with the different natures between the two parameters .",
    "the infrared - to - ultraviolet ratio is in tight correlation to dust attenuation in general cases compared to the uv color , and thus the irx maps are believed to take better pictures of dust attenuation distributions in galaxies . on the contrary , the uv color is sensitive to not only one single parameter , and the degeneracy of parameters in uv color is very likely to erase any character of single factor .",

    "the two - parameter scenario adopted for characterizing the observational data in section [ result1 ] assumes simple stellar populations with an instantaneous burst .",
    "this assumption is an approximation of stellar populations contained in galactic subregions . as a matter of fact , although subregions inside galaxies are simpler in sfh than integrated galaxies , stellar populations still tend to be born beyond the instantaneous burst on a scale of several hundreds parsecs , which has the potential to oversimplify the stellar populations and introduce inaccuracies in the resulting descriptions of age for the measured regions . in this section , we will propose a series of composite stellar populations for the modeled scenarios , and discuss potential influences of the complexities in sfh on the irx - uv properties .",
    "spectra of the composite stellar populations are constructed via the galaxev library of evolutionary population synthesis @xcite , on an assumption of exponentially decreasing sfr ( @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is stellar population age and @xmath49 is constant of star formation timescale ) , with the @xcite imf .",
    "the difference between the two imfs exists in descriptions of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , and has no effective influence on uv stellar emission studied in this work . ] and solar metallicity ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "figure [ color_vs_age ] shows intrinsic @xmath19 as a function of stellar population age in various sfh scenarios : simple stellar populations with an instantaneous burst , composite stellar populations with six types of exponential decreases in sfr ( @xmath49 = 0.01 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 8 gyr ) , and constant sfr of 1 @xmath50 .",
    "we produce two scenarios of an instantaneous burst in this figure from starburst99 and galaxev respectively for the purpose of comparison between the two libraries .",
    "the exponentially decreasing and constant sfrs are derived from the galaxev library .",
    "as clearly illustrated in this figure , stellar populations born with an instantaneous burst present the most tremendous reddening of uv color with increasing age , in particular at age @xmath35200 myr : @xmath19 extends from 0.3 to @xmath313.0 mag within an age range of 200@xmath6700 myr .",
    "the reddening evolution of uv color tends to fade in the scenarios of composite stellar populations , and it is apparent to see at longer star formation time that @xmath19 appears to be more insensitive to age .",
    "the exponentially decreasing sfr with @xmath49 = 0.01 gyr has a color evolution comparable to the instantaneous burst ; at @xmath49 = 0.1 gyr , the reddening of uv color becomes intensive after 500 myr age ; for longer star formation time , @xmath19 retains a constant value @xmath310.0 mag until stellar populations evolve to @xmath312 gyr at @xmath49 = 0.5 gyr , @xmath315 gyr at @xmath49 = 1 gyr , and @xmath3110 gyr at @xmath49 = 2 gyr ; stellar populations with @xmath49 = 8 gyr and the constant sfr produce identical evolutionary tracks of uv color , where @xmath19 @xmath31 0.0 mag during the lifetime up to 20 gyr .",
    "complex sfhs introduce the degeneracy of stellar population age and star formation timescale in @xmath19 : larger @xmath49 means more extended sfh and results in bluer color than smaller @xmath49 at constant age .",
    "it is worth noting in figure [ color_vs_age ] that , there is a reversing point on each of the evolutionary tracks produced with the galaxev library except the sfhs of @xmath49 = 8 gyr and the constant sfr , which suggests an upper limit for uv color at a certain age , and after this stage the color is supposed to experience a kind of blueing evolution .",
    "this feature is different from the starburst99 product where @xmath19 is on the monotonic increase during the whole lifetime of stellar populations , by comparison between the two models for the same instantaneous burst in this figure .",
    "it is also displayed that the reversing points on the galaxev tracks emerge in later periods and the upper limits appear at lower values if stellar populations evolve with larger @xmath49 .",
    "as shown in this figure , the sfhs of an instantaneous burst and @xmath51 gyr yield the reddest colors over 3.6 mag during 1@xmath62 gyr ; for @xmath49 = 2 gyr , the maximum in @xmath19 drops to @xmath310.3 mag , and the time falls to @xmath3120 gyr ; and between them , the reversing point for longer star formation time appears to locate on the track for lower @xmath49 , and after the reversing point the both sfhs tend to share a common evolutionary track .",
    "the presence of the blueing evolution is ascribed to the additional account of fuv emission from late - type post - asymptotic - giant - branch ( post - agb ) stars in the galaxev library @xcite .",
    "figure [ comp_model ] shows a comparison between uv spectral energy distributions ( seds ) derived respectively from the starburst99 and galaxev libraries for an instantaneous burst at two specic ages as an example to illustrate the difference in spectral shape .",
    "the contribution of the post - agb stars manifests as the constant spectrum with an even rising trend shortwards from 2000 @xmath52 wavelength derived from the galaxev library for 8 gyr age ; whereas the starburst99 spectrum for this age presents a steep decline in the same wavelength range .    in figure [ irxuv_uv_m81_sfh ]",
    ", we superimpose grids reproduced with composite stellar populations on the irx - uv diagrams for ngc  3031 as plotted in figure [ irxuv_uv_m81 ] , and four types of exponential decreases in sfr ( @xmath49 = 0.1 , 0.5 , 1 , and 8 gyr ) are shown respectively in each panel .",
    "the modeled curves with constant ages are displayed in parallel with each other in the figure , and with increasing ages the equivalent amounts of dust attenuation tend to stand at moderately higher levels of irx . compared with the sfh with an instantaneous burst , these curves for composite stellar populations are confined in narrower @xmath19 spaces , and the irx - uv functions with different ages tend to approach each other with increasing @xmath49 .",
    "for instance , in the irx - uv planes , an age interval between 2 and 500 myr for @xmath53 gyr introduces a difference of @xmath310.7 mag in @xmath19 , while in the same age scale but for @xmath54 gyr , the color differences diminish to less than 0.4 mag .",
    "in addition to the five certain ages addressed in section [ result1 ] ( figures [ irxuv_uv_m81]@xmath6[irxuv_uv_total ] ) , we further sample three older ages in figure [ irxuv_uv_m81_sfh ] : 800 myr , 3 gyr , and 8 gyr . in the panel of @xmath53 gyr ,",
    "the curve with the age of 800 myr lies in a range where @xmath55 mag ; while for @xmath56 gyr , the same regimes in the irx - uv diagrams belong to stellar populations evolving over 8 gyr ; when @xmath49 increases to 8 gyr , ages ranging from 100 myr to 8 gyr are not distinguishable in the irx - uv planes , and stellar populations in this timescale have intrinsic colors @xmath57 mag .",
    "the model with composite stellar populations manifests substantial disparities in description of the same observational data with different sfh scenarios . in our work",
    ", the uv clusters inside the galaxies are measured with the subtraction of underlying diffuse emission ( see section [ measure ] ) , which enables the extraction stellar populations with an instantaneous burst or short star formation timescale , and @xmath58 gyr is not considered to be appropriate for the uv clusters ; by contrast , the local background populations are supposed to experience longer - term star formation in sfh .",
    "in this situation , we expect to adopt diverse sfh scenarios to characterize the two populations .",
    "the irx - uv diagram for ngc  3031 shows a clear separation between the uv clusters , the disk background regions , and the bulge background regions ( figure [ irxuv_uv_m81 ] ) . as we have noted in section [ 3031 ] ,",
    "a considerable number of the disk background regions are categorized in the same age range for the uv clusters in the scenario of simple stellar populations , which is one of the discrepancies between the observational data and the model scenario in this paper . to address this problem , the model of composite stellar populations",
    "offers a suggestion from the viewpoint of sfh , where the local background regions are characterized as older stellar populations with increasing star formation timescales . in figure",
    "[ irxuv_uv_m81_sfh ] , for instance , the scenario with @xmath53 gyr offers a description of age @xmath321 gyr for the local background regions , while in the scenario with @xmath59 gyr most of these regions correspond to stellar population age extending to 8 gyr . due to the variations in sfh , it is very likely for stellar populations with a large disparity in age to lie close to each other or even overlap in the irx - uv diagram , and in this case , the appearance of the age parameter tends to be of less prominence in the irx - uv function .",

    "the separation between the uv clusters and the local background regions in the irx - uv diagram is obviously displayed for ngc  4536 and ngc  7331 ( aside from the ring area ) , visible but not very apparent to distinguish for ngc  6946 , and completely absent for ngc  5194 ( figures [ irxuv_uv_m51]@xmath6[irxuv_uv_ngc7331 ] ) . when the diversity of sfh is applied to these galaxies ,",
    "the local background regions are expected to have longer star formation timescales than the uv clusters , and the factual difference in stellar population age between the two components inside each galaxy tends to exceed the interpretation of the offset in the irx - uv diagram on assumption of one identical sfh . combining the data points in figures [ irxuv_uv_m51]@xmath6[irxuv_uv_ngc7331 ] and the modeled curves in figure [ irxuv_uv_m81_sfh ]",
    ", we can see that , most of the local background regions are characterized to cover an age range of 1@xmath68 gyr with @xmath59 gyr , and longer star formation timescales assign the same age range for bluer color spaces .",
    "in such cases , the uv clusters and the local background regions are able to possess the adjacent or even common regimes in @xmath19 at similar levels of irx , in spite of possible disparities in stellar population age .",
    "however , the variations in sfh still fail to provide any better solution to the other discrepancies in characterizing the irx - uv relation for the galaxies with the scenario of simple stellar populations presented in section [ result1 ] .",
    "it is evident that , a few number of uv clusters inside ngc  3031 and several local background regions inside ngc  5194 which have bluer uv colors at fixed irx than the prediction of the scenario with an instantaneous burst remain outside the coverage of the grid modeled with any other sfh , and a half of uv clusters inside ngc  5194 and ring clusters inside ngc  7331 which are estimated as several hundreds of megayears assuming an instantaneous burst possess even older regimes in age with increasing star formation timescales .",
    "figure [ irxuv_uv_total ] shows significant dispersion in the composite irx - uv relation for a total number of the uv clusters , and the scenario with an instantaneous burst fails to provide an adequate interpretation of the data distribution .",
    "the variations in sfh are shown in figure [ irxuv_uv_m81_sfh ] to have an effective impact on the irx - uv properties for stellar populations with age @xmath62100 myr .",
    "for instance , between the sfhs with an instantaneous burst and the @xmath53 gyr star formation , there is a scatter of @xmath310.3 mag in @xmath19 at fixed irx for the age of 100 myr , and a scatter of @xmath310.6 mag in @xmath19 for 300 myr .",
    "older ages and longer star formation timescales are not taken into consideration for the uv clusters .",
    "in this situation , although uv clusters are believed to contain much simpler stellar populations than galactic background , the limited variations in sfh are still likely to introduce a moderate level of dispersion in figure [ irxuv_uv_total ] , particularly in view of the different physical scales of the measured regions inside different galaxies ( see section [ measure ] ) .",
    "the adoption of various sfhs complements the interpretation of the data distributions with the model assuming simple stellar populations .",
    "however , it remains deficient for the current scenarios to well characterize all the data . as a number of studies have suggested , various dust grain properties and diverse spatial geometries are suspected of causing discrepancies in the relationship between attenuation and observed color indices at certain wavebands , which thus leads to different irx - uv trends ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in paper ii",
    ", we will investigate the dependence of the irx - uv relation on attenuation / extinction law and attempt to discover more parameters in the irx - uv function , specically in order to obtain solutions from an alternative viewpoint to the discrepancies between the observational data and the current scenarios .",
    "statistical studies of integrated galaxies have shown large dispersion in the irx - uv relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although stellar population age has been widely considered as the second parameter for introducing the deviation , until now there has not been sufficient evidence to confirm the age effect on the irx - uv relation for integrated galaxies @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the comparisons between the spatially resolved measurements and the integrated properties of galaxies provide implications about the conundrum in integrated studies of galaxies .",
    "the locations of integrated galaxies and galactic subregions in the irx - uv diagrams ( figures [ irxuv_uv_m81]@xmath6[irxuv_uv_ngc7331 ] ) and the fractional contributions of component to integrated luminosities of galaxies ( table [ contri ] ) indicate that , any single component lacks the ability to dominate the integrated luminosities of galaxies , and integrated measurements of normal galaxies are aggregations of various populations and different components within galaxies . as also implied in , simple age tracers",
    "are not in a good position to estimate stellar population age in such a case .",
    "if galaxies exhibit prominent features in sub - structures at certain observational bands , the integrated measurements can have an effective impact .",
    "in most cases of integrated measurements which compromise different stellar populations in galaxies and consequently represent more complexities in sfh , contrary to spatially resolved studies , any significant variation in the irx - uv trend as a function of stellar population age tends to become unclear and probably masked by other potential factors .",
    "moreover , even though in the simple situation any other parameter is negligible , the effects of stellar population age are suggested to be more complicated than we have realized in the irx - uv plane @xcite .",
    "in this work , we perform a spatially resolved analysis of five spiral galaxies selected from the sings sample , aimed at investigating the impacts of dust attenuation and stellar population age on the irx - uv relation , and thereby to provide better insights into the influences of dust and stellar population properties on uv and ir observations of galaxies .",
    "aperture photometry is extracted for all positions within the galaxies .",
    "we divide the measured regions into uv clusters and local background regions . for ngc  3031",
    "we further divide the local background regions into disk regions and bulge regions , and for ngc  7331 we mark the regions in the ring area , in order to illuminate their special properties .",
    "the classification of different populations can help to distinguish the signature of stellar population age in the irx - uv function .",
    "we also measure the integrated luminosities of the entire galaxies and the galactic center areas in order to compare the integrated and spatially resolved properties of galaxies .",
    "one of our main results is the separation of the effects of age and dust attenuation on the irx - uv relation which failed to be revealed by studies of integrated galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the age signature is indicated by systematic offsets of the local background regions towards redder color ranges from the uv clusters in the irx - uv diagrams due to the intrinsic redder uv colors for evolved stellar populations .",
    "this kind of displacement is clearly seen in ngc  3031 , ngc  4536 , and ngc  7331 ; distinguishable but less prominent in ngc  6946 ; and completely invisible in ngc  5194 .",
    "when we attempt to constrain variations in the age parameter by plotting all the uv clusters in one diagram , the composite relation does nt display a common trend , and instead presents a considerable degree of scatter .",
    "variations in sfh are suggested as a potential cause of weakening the age effects on the irx - uv relation , and we therefore interpret the different levels of overlapping between the uv clusters and the local background regions , as well as a few portions of the dispersion in the composite relation for all the uv clusters .",
    "however , definite discrepancies still appear in the descriptions of the data loci for ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 , ngc  7331 , and the total number of uv clusters by the scenarios assuming any of the sfhs .",
    "these difficulties indicate the necessity of other parameters such as attenuation / extinction law in operation of the irx - uv function . the coincident requirement was suggested in . with this in consideration , further examinations involving attenuation / extinction law",
    "will be under taken in paper ii .    through the investigations into the integrated properties of galaxies and the fractional contributions of different components to the integrated measurements , we find that the uv clusters account for @xmath63 of the overall luminosities of galaxies , and the integrated characters are represented by the local background in most cases . if galaxies perform prominent features in substructures , the organizational regime will be reformed , and integrated measurements of galaxies tend to be biased by the substructures in this case : in our sample the star - forming center in ngc  4536 and the dust ring in ngc  7331 play dominant roles in the integrated measurements of their host galaxies .",
    "the subregions in ngc  6946 present a vast scatter in the irx - uv diagram , and consequently , the location of the integrated galaxy has the largest deviation from the starburst empirical curve in our sample .",
    "in addition , the irx - uv relation depends weakly on luminosity showing that either @xmath19 color or irx is inversely related to fuv luminosity , differing from the results from the statistical studies of integrated galaxies , which is due to the different natures of the sources sampled between the two kinds of studies .",
    "the radial trends for @xmath19 color and irx present declining gradients from the center to the edge in galaxies . from the two - dimensional maps , the different spatial distributions between the two parameters can be further seen : the @xmath19 color descends with increasing galactic radii more symmetrically and smoothly , whereas the irx exhibits several sorts of substructures such as spiral arms and clumps .",
    "this discrimination provides a spatial mirror of the dispersion in the irx - uv relation .",

    "in this work , the observed total ir luminosity l(ir ) is estimated from 8 and 24 @xmath7 m luminosities via c05 calibration ( equation ( [ c05_cali ] ) in this paper ) , since the poor resolution of _ spitzer _ mips 70 and 160 @xmath7 m observations hinders us from applying longer wavelength imaging .",

    "hereafter denoted as dh02 ) as the reference of l(ir ) .",
    "the sample used in c05 calibration is star - forming regions in ngc  5194 , and for these regions a predominant fraction of the total ir luminosity originates from short wavelength components of ir continua . in this situation ,",
    "c05 calibration is suitable for young stellar populations such as the uv clusters in our work . for more evolved populations such as the local background regions or integrated galaxies ,",
    "it is not clear whether or not the same prescription can still provide appropriate estimations . in consideration of this question , here we compare total ir luminosities derived from c05 and dh02 methods , and examine the usability of c05 calibration in more general cases .    in figure",
    "[ irxuv_d07 ] , we plot the irx - uv diagram for the d07 integrated measurements of the sings galaxies , where the total ir luminosity is calculated by employing c05 calibration ( 8 and 24 @xmath7 m ) . for the purpose of comparison , here we plot the same diagram in figure [ irxuv_d07_2 ] but estimate l(ir ) by adopting dh02 prescription ( 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath7 m ) .",
    "the data loci in the both diagrams hold a consistent degree of scatter , but in figure [ irxuv_d07_2 ] the data points lie at a higher level in the diagram and populate closer to the starburst empirical line . in figure",
    "[ comptir ] , we further compare c05- and dh02-calibrated total ir luminosities , l(ir)@xmath64 ( 8 - 24 @xmath7 m calibration ) and l(ir)@xmath65 ( 24 - 70 - 160 @xmath7 m calibration ) , for the same sample .",
    "the left panel of figure [ comptir ] shows @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "for all data points , dh02 estimation yields larger l(ir ) than c05 prescription , with margins of 0.2@xmath60.5 dex for most galaxies . at the same time",
    ", this diagram shows an obvious trend that , when l(24 @xmath7",
    "m ) accounts for a tiny minority of l(ir ) , there is a vast offset between l(ir)@xmath64 and l(ir)@xmath65 , even as much as 1.0 dex ; but if the contribution of l(24 @xmath7 m ) to l(ir ) increases , the offset tends to become of less significance , and l(ir)@xmath64 is therefore comparable to l(ir)@xmath65 .",
    "the offset in irx introduced by the different ir calibrations is apparently shown in the right panel of figure [ comptir ] .",
    "the c05-based irxs appear to be lower by a typical value of @xmath310.4 than dh02 products .",
    "the analysis of ir estimation implies that , the total ir luminosities derived via c05 calibration in this paper are likely to be underestimated , particularly for the local background regions and the integrated galaxies .",
    "figure [ cali_tir ] shows the correlation between @xmath68 vs. @xmath69 for the sings galaxies with the d07 measurements , which offers a rough recipe to estimate l(ir)@xmath65 from l(ir)@xmath64 and l(24 @xmath7 m ) and therefore to compensate the possible bias in l(ir)@xmath64 .",
    "the best - fitting curve for the data points in this figure provides the equation : @xmath70 we adopt this equation to re - estimate the total ir luminosities for the galaxies in our sample , and the resulting irx - uv diagrams are displayed in figures [ irxuv2_uv_m81]@xmath6[irxuv2_uv_total ] .",
    "the new version of the irx - uv relations presents shapes of loci generally consistent with those in figures [ irxuv_uv_m81]@xmath6[irxuv_uv_total ] , but the data points systematically shift to higher irx levels by an average factor of 0.4 .",
    "the change in total ir luminosity has no impact on the age signature , and the offset between the uv clusters and the local background regions remains to be seen for ngc  3031 , ngc  4536 , ngc  6946 , and ngc  7331 , with different levels of overlapping .",
    "the discrepancies existing in the distributions for ngc  3031 , ngc  5194 , and ngc  7331 are still unsolved in the updated diagrams , and the significant dispersion remains in the composite relation for the total uv clusters .",
    "equation ( [ eq_a1 ] ) serves as an approximate modification of c05 calibration applied to evolved stellar populations .",
    "the direct purpose of introducing this correction is to examine the potential deviation in the ir estimation in this paper .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize that , the conversion between l(ir)@xmath65 and l(ir)@xmath64 is questionable in more general cases . for young stellar populations such as extragalactic star - forming regions ,",
    "c05 calibration is still supposed to be an optimal approach to assessing total ir luminosity when only 8 and 24 @xmath7 m data are available .",
    "the difference between the results from dh02 and c05 calibrations arises primarily from different dust temperatures triggered by young and evolved stellar populations .",
    "as an example , for ngc  3031 the dust heated by diffuse emission of evolved stellar populations has the temperature of about 19 k and the corresponding ir continuum peaks at around 160 @xmath7 m , whereas young ionizing sources trigger the dust temperature over 100 k with the consequent ir luminosity peaking at around 24 @xmath7 m @xcite ; the average dust temperature for the integrated ngc  3031 is about 30 k and the ir continuum peaks at around 100 @xmath7 m @xcite .",
    "therefore , for galactic background or integrated galaxies where evolved populations dominate stellar contents , the cold dust contributes ir emission , and in this case the estimation of ir luminosity from short waveband monochromatic fluxes calibrated on a basis of warm - dust - dominating sources fails to reach the longer wavelength component of ir continuum and introduces the underestimate of ir luminosity .",
    "the left panel of figure [ comptir ] suggests a trend that , when warmer dust contributes ir emission which is reflected by the increasing proportion of 24 @xmath7 m to total ir luminosity , the two estimators tend to match with each other ; by contrast , the contribution of colder dust would augment the deviation .",
