    "our goal is to treat relativistically the response of an electron system to a periodic electric field in the framework of 1 + 1 dimensional qed ( qed@xmath1 ) .",
    "we assume the presence of a classical periodic electric mean field , i.e. the electromagnetic field variable @xmath2 is the sum of this classical field and the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the interaction of the fermions with this classical field is treated exactly , whereas the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are taken into account at 1-loop order . requiring that the classical field is a mean field enables us to investigate a wigner crystal ( wigner 1934 , grimes 1979 ) relativistically . to get a better understanding of such an electron system , it is unavoidable to investigate its non - perturbative response to a classical periodic electric field , that is the issue of the present work .",
    "the classical periodic electric field is chosen in the form : @xmath3 with amplitude @xmath4 and wavenumber @xmath5 .",
    "the homogeneous term @xmath0 corresponds to the chemical potential of the system .",
    "in qed the expectation value of the gauge field vanishes . to take into account a mean field self - consistently in this theory we should modify its generating functional .",
    "our method is based on defining a sector of qed for field configurations belonging to quantum fluctuations around a given vacuum expectation value @xmath6 .",
    "we multipy the integrand of the common generating functional of qed@xmath1 by the factor 1 written in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a vector in the space of the vector potential configurations and with @xmath9 the spacetime volume .",
    "then , we find @xmath10 where the functional @xmath11 is the generating functional of the sector belonging to vector potential configurations in a hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath12 is the electromagnetic and @xmath13 is the dirac field , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the action of the electromagnetic field and the dirac action , resp . , and @xmath16 is the gauge fixing parameter . by shifting the integration variable according to @xmath17 ,",
    "the projected generating functional becomes @xmath18 self - consistency requires that @xmath19 this condition fixes the value of @xmath20 . to fulfill the requirement of ( [ constraint ] ) an extra renormalization condition",
    "is needed to every single loop correction . in our treatment",
    "the form of @xmath21 coincides with ( [ meanfield ] ) .",
    "calculations of any physical quantity is performed by taking an expectation value of that quantity with the modified generating functional .    to determine the lindhard function we should calculate the polarization @xmath22",
    "the form of which in qed is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electron propagator .",
    "diagrammatically @xmath22 corresponds to the diagram in fig . 1 .",
    "( without the external legs ) . in fig .",
    "1 . the solid lines represent the electron propagator and the wavy lines correspond to the photon propagator .",
    "since we are interested first in the response of the electron system to an arbitrary periodic potential , @xmath4 and @xmath5 should be considered as free parameters in the lindhard function .",
    "the electron propagator belonging to the projected generating functional contains all the effects of the periodic classical field and the propagator itself looses its translational symmetry due to this sinusoidal vector potential .",
    "another consequence of the periodic classical field is that the electron propagator from ( [ zqedp ] ) does not have analytic form , the linhard response function can only be obtained numerically .",
    "first , we write down @xmath25 in momentum space according to : @xmath26 in momentum space the two - vector @xmath27 is the momentum of the photon in fig .",
    "1 . coming from the left , while @xmath28 denotes the momentum of the outgoing photon . performing the integrations in ( [ pikkp ] )",
    "we get : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are positive energy eigenvalues corresponding to the positive and negative frequency eigenspinors of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath32 $ ] with the potential ( [ meanfield ] ) , and @xmath33 contains products of the eigenspinors of @xmath32 $ ] in the following form : @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are parts of the bloch type eigenspinors ( nagy 2000 ) .",
    "the first dirac delta in ( [ pi ] ) expresses the breaking of the translational symmetry due to the periodic field .",
    "we expect that ( [ pi ] ) at close to @xmath37 has a maximum value for @xmath38 when the fermi surface is positioned close to the boundary of the brillouin zone .",
    "it would mean that there is no energy exchange between the two electrons in fig . 1 .",
    "but they exchange momentum @xmath39 .",
    "it reminds us to the so called peierls phase transition where near the fermi surface electrons can jump from one side of the fermi surface to the other without any energy cost .",
    "the instability caused by this procedure is stabilized by a gap in the dispersion relation arising at the edge of the fermi surface . in our treatment",
    "the stability is ensured by the periodic electric mean field which produces a gap at the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "the authors would like to thank j. polonyi and g. plunien for the useful discussions .",
