    "we refer to this process of formation of dense cores in mcs by super  sonic turbulence as _",
    "turbulent fragmentation_. since protostars evolve from the collapse of gravitationally unstable cores in mcs , even the stellar imf could then be the result of turbulent fragmentation , with the power law shape of the imf ultimately being the consequence of the self",
    " similar nature of turbulence .",
    "in this paper we do not use these increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations directly , but instead develop an analytic model .",
    "the assumptions of the model are _ inspired _ by the qualitative properties of the numerical model , but the current work does not _ depend _ on any particular set of numerical models or results .",
    "previous analytic models by larson ( 1992 ) , henriksen ( 1986 , 1991 ) and elmegreen ( 1993 , 1997 , 1999 , 2000b ) have derived the stellar imf on the basis of the self  similar structure of mcs .",
    "larson , assuming one dimensional accretion , predicted a rather steep imf slope , equal to the mc fractal dimension , while henriksen found the imf slope to depend on both the mc fractal dimension and the relation between density and linear size for structures inside mcs .",
    "elmegreen pointed out that the imf that results from random sampling of a self  similar cloud has an exponent @xmath2 ( salpeter @xmath3 ) , independent of the cloud fractal dimension . in elmegreen s model",
    "the imf is steeper than @xmath2 because the random sampling rate is assumed to be proportional to the square root of density , and because of `` mass competition '' .",
    "these models are based on assumptions about the cloud geometry justified by the apparent fractal structure of mcs ( beech 1987 ; bazell & dsert 1988 , scalo 1990 ; dickman , horvath & margulis 1990 ; falgarone , phillips & walker 1991 ; zimmermann , stutzki & winnewisser 1992 ; henriksen 1991 ; hetem & lepine 1993 ; vogelaar & wakker 1994 ; elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ) , but the processes responsible for generating the assumed geometry are not discussed in detail .    in a previous attempt to relate the stellar imf to the physical properties of super  sonic turbulence ( padoan , nordlund & jones 1997 )",
    ", we obtained the distribution of the local jeans mass in super  sonic isothermal turbulence , from the probability distribution of the gas density .",
    "that work also provides a prediction for the stellar imf , by identifying each local jeans mass with a protostar . although the prediction of the lower mass cutoff and the low mass portion of the imf might be roughly correct , this model under  estimates the number of massive stars relative to low mass stars ( as any other log - normal imf ) .",
    "the main reason , as pointed out by scalo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , is the unphysical assumption that the most massive stars originate from gas at relatively low density including only a small fraction of the total mass .    in the present work we consider specific properties of mc turbulence and their consequences for the formation of protostellar cores . in particular , we i ) assume approximate self ",
    "similarity of the super  sonic and super  alfvnic velocity field , expressed by a power law shape of the power spectrum of turbulence , and ii ) assume that the jump conditions for isothermal mhd shocks determine the scaling of the typical size of protostellar cores .",
    "based on these fundamental assumptions , we are able to derive a power law mass distribution of gravitationally unstable cores , with a slope consistent with the salpeter stellar imf ( salpeter 1955 ) . in order to derive the mass distribution of gravitationally unstable cores below one solar mass we also make use of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the mass density in super  sonic turbulence , following padoan , nordlund & jones ( 1997 ) .",
    "the formation of dense cores and the relation between the size of cores and the thickness of the postshock gas are discussed in the next section . in ",
    "3 the power spectrum of super  sonic turbulence is discussed .",
    "results on the pdf of the gas density in super  sonic turbulence are summarized in   4 .",
    "the mass distribution of dense cores formed by the process of turbulent fragmentation is derived in   5 , and the mass distribution of gravitationally unstable cores",

    "conclusions are summarized in   9 .",
    "the qualitative properties of the local density maxima that form in super  sonic turbulence follow from first principles and numerical experiments have confirmed such properties .",
    "dense cores are formed in roughly isothermal super  sonic turbulent flows as the densest parts of sheets or filaments of shocked gas .",
    "their typical size is therefore comparable to the sheet thickness , @xmath4 . assuming that the magnetic pressure in the postshock gas exceeds the thermal pressure ( this is the case for a large range of values of the preshock magnetic field strength , even when the flow is super  alfvnic ) , the isothermal shock jump conditions are : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the values of the gas density and magnetic field strength before and after the shocks , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the linear extension of the gas before the shock ( measured in the direction perpendicular to the shock surface ) and @xmath4 is the thickness of the postshock gas .",
    "@xmath13 is the alfvnic mach number of the shock , that is the ratio of the flow velocity and the alfvn velocity measured in the preshock gas : @xmath14 + here the relevant magnetic field components are the ones parallel to the shock surface , because the perpendicular component does not provide pressure support against the compression and it is not amplified by the compression . since only the parallel components of @xmath15 are amplified , the field in the postshock sheets is nearly parallel to the sheet surface , and elongated in the direction of dense filaments ( real ones , or two  dimensional sections of sheets ) . since dense cores are formed predominantly in corrugations of sheets , the magnetic field within dense cores can occasionally show a strong curvature , depending on the orientation relative to the line of sight .",
    "this may considerably complicate the interpretation of dust polarization measurements ( ward  thompson et al .",
    "2000 ) and should be taken into account .",
    "the power spectrum of turbulence in the inertial range ( below the energy injection scale and above the dissipation scale ) may be assumed to be a power law , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the wave  number , and the spectral index is @xmath18 for incompressible turbulence ( kolmogorov power spectrum ) ( kolmogorov 1941 ) , and @xmath19 for pressureless turbulence ( burgers power spectrum ) ( burgers 1974 ; gotoh & kraichnan 1993 ) . the @xmath20 power spectrum has often been assumed to be the correct power spectrum of super - sonic turbulence , at least for the compressional component of the velocity field .    the purpose of the present work is primarily that of establishing analytically a relation between the power spectrum of turbulence and the stellar imf and we only need to assume that the power spectrum is a power law in the inertial range .",
    "our analytic model does not assume a specific value of the spectral index , as obtained for example in numerical simulations .",
    "however , the predictions of our analytic model will be tested using the power spectrum of super  sonic turbulence computed from numerical simulations or estimated from observational data .",
    "for that reason we briefly summarize in this section some numerical and observational results .",
    "the most detailed study of the power spectrum of numerical compressible turbulence has been presented by porter , pouquet & woodward ( 1992 , 1994 ) and porter , woodward & pouquet ( 1998 ) . from the 1992 paper to the 1998 paper the largest numerical resolution increased from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "these works are limited to decaying turbulence , with mach numbers close to unity initially , and below unity at later times .",
    "the runs are therefore sub  sonic , except for an initial period of time . a magnetic field",
    "is not included .",
    "the velocity field is usually decomposed into its solenoidal @xmath23 and compressional @xmath24 components as @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the velocity fourier spectrum , @xmath28 , is also separated into its solenoidal and compressional parts : @xmath29 .",
    "porter , pouquet & woodward ( 1992 ) found that the compressional modes have a power spectrum @xmath30 , and the solenoidal modes @xmath31 . in the later works , after the larger numerical resolution runs were performed , the same authors concluded instead that both compressional and solenoidal modes develop a kolmogorov power spectrum , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 ( porter , pouquet & woodward 1994 ; porter , woodward & pouquet 1998 ) .",
    "this conclusion is not strongly supported by the plots of power spectra presented by the authors , since the largest resolution runs ( @xmath34 and @xmath22 ) are consistent with a kolmogorov power spectrum for the solenoidal modes only over a very limited range of wave  numbers , approximately @xmath35 . at larger wave  numbers , the power spectrum is flatter , approximately @xmath31 .",
    "an interpretation of the shallower power spectrum of solenoidal modes at large wave numbers is provided , in terms of a `` near dissipation range '' .",
    "the discrepancy between the steeper ( burgers ) power spectrum of compressional modes in the early @xmath21 runs ( porter , pouquet & woodward 1992 ) and the kolmogorov power spectrum in the latest @xmath21 runs ( porter , pouquet & woodward 1994 ; porter , woodward & pouquet 1998 ) is not discussed .",
    "we have recently started to perform a large number of numerical experiments with the purpose of computing the spectral index of the inertial range of driven super ",
    "sonic mhd turbulence as a function of the sonic and alfvnic rms mach numbers of the flow .",
    "the experiments use an isothermal equation of state , uniform initial density and magnetic fields , random initial velocity and random large scale forcing ( both solenoidal ) , as described in previous works ( padoan et al .",
    "1998 ; padoan & nordlund 1999 ; padoan , zweibel & nordlund 2000 ) .",
    "the results of these new experiments will be reported and discussed elsewhere .",
    "results on power spectra and structure functions are reported in boldyrev , nordlund & padoan ( 2002 ) , where the scaling relations are also predicted on the basis of a new analytic model of super  sonic turbulence ( boldyrev 2002 ) .",
    "a power spectrum intermediate between the burgers and the kolmogorov power spectra is found , @xmath36 .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion  size larson relation ( larson 1979 , 1981 ) , @xmath37 , should reflect the power spectrum of turbulence in the interstellar medium ( @xmath38 ) , although it is often obtained from a combination of different clouds and cores inside the same cloud , or even different molecular transitions ( see goodman et al .",

    "velocity relation @xmath53 , or a power spectrum with @xmath54 .",
    "previous attempts to measure the power spectrum of turbulence in molecular clouds with the same method had provided much shallower spectra ( kleiner & dickman 1987 ; hobson 1992 ) .    a new method to estimate",
    "the power spectrum of turbulence in molecular clouds has also been recently proposed by brunt & heyer ( 2002 ) , using the principal component analysis by heyer & schloerb ( 1997 ) .",
    "the method has already been applied to 23 molecular clouds in the outer galaxy , and the result is a power spectrum with exponent varying from cloud to cloud , in the range @xmath55 , with a typical error of 0.08 .",
    "the average exponent is @xmath56 .",
    "this method has been calibrated using stochastic fields ( stutzki et al .",
    "1998 ) , with purely random phases and no correlation between density and velocity .",
    "correlations in real turbulent flows are likely to be important , and could affect the calibration of this method .",
    "the study of probability density functions ( pdf ) in turbulent flows has received increasing attention over the last few years .",
    "pdfs can provide important information complementary to power spectra .",
    "a well known example of a combined use of power spectrum and pdf , limited to linear density fluctuations , is the press ",
    "schechter model of the galaxy mass distribution ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "a number of numerical studies have established that the pdf of mass density in isothermal turbulent flows is well approximated by a log  normal distribution ( vzquez - semadeni 1994 ; padoan , nordlund & jones 1997 ; scalo et al .",
    "1998 ; passot & vzquez - semadeni 1998 ; nordlund & padoan 1999 ; ostriker , gammie & stone 1999 ) , which can be understood analytically ( nordlund & padoan 1999 ) .",
    "a highly radiative turbulent flow develops a complex system of interacting shocks that are able to fragment the mass distribution into a random network of dense cores , filaments and sheets and low density `` voids '' , with a large density contrast .",
    "the intermittent nature of the log  normal pdf of mass density means that most of the mass concentrates in a small fraction of the total volume of the simulation .    the log  normal distribution may be written as : @xmath57d\\ln n ' \\label{pdf1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the number density in units of the average density @xmath59 , @xmath60 the mean of the logarithm of density , @xmath61 , is determined by the standard deviation of the logarithm of density , @xmath62 : @xmath63 which is found to be a function of the rms mach number of the flow @xmath64 : @xmath65 or , for the linear density : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , from numerical experiments .",
    "the standard deviation of the linear density distribution thus grows linearly with the rms mach number of the flow ( nordlund & padoan 1999 ; ostriker , gammie & stone 1999 ) .",
    "in this section we derive the mass distribution of dense cores based on the two following assumptions : i ) the power spectrum of turbulence is a power law ; ii ) the typical size of a dense core scales as the thickness of the postshock gas .",
    "if the typical size of a dense core is comparable to the thickness of the postshock gas , @xmath4 (   2 ) , its mass @xmath68 is : @xmath69 where we have used the jump conditions ( [ mhdn ] ) and ( [ mhdl ] ) . equation ( [ m ] ) shows that on a given scale @xmath12 , the mass of dense cores is proportional to the total mass available ( @xmath70 ) divided by the second power of the mach number on that scale ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "given the power spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) , the rms velocity , @xmath72 on the scale @xmath12 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 the typical shock velocity on the scale @xmath12 is therefore @xmath75 , and the shock mach number is given by ( [ ma ] ) , where @xmath76 is replaced by @xmath75 .",
    "substituting this scale dependent expression of @xmath13 into ( [ m ] ) one obtains @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the ( large ) scale where the turbulent velocity is @xmath79 and the rms mach number is @xmath80 .    the smallest scale where significant density fluctuations may be expected is approximately the scale where the mach number is of order unity : @xmath81 in mcs with a mass @xmath82  m@xmath83 a typical value of the mach number is @xmath84 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath85  m@xmath83 , for @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath78 in equation ( [ m2 ] ) is defined as the largest scale of the turbulent flow ( the scale of turbulent energy injection ) , and we take @xmath87 , we obtain an estimate of the mass of the largest cores formed by turbulent fragmentation , @xmath88 where @xmath80 is the rms mach number on the largest turbulent scale . in mcs with a mass @xmath82  m@xmath83 and mach number @xmath89 , @xmath90  m@xmath83 .",
    "to arrive at the distribution of core masses we first consider the mass distribution of a completely self  similar case and then consider the modification arising from the mach number dependence .",
    "the completely self  similar case leads to equal mass contributions from each logarithmic interval ( imf slope -1 ) , as shown by elmegreen ( 1997 ) , who also demonstrated that this result does not depend on the fractal dimension of the self  similar distribution . to illustrate this result , and to derive the modification of it due to the mach number dependence , it is useful to consider the setup and interpretation of numerical experiments .",
    "numerical turbulence experiments are in a certain sense scale  free ; the density is usually rescaled so that the average density @xmath91 and the size of the box is scaled so that @xmath92 . the only distinguishing , scale dependent properties that remain after such scalings are the ( sonic and alfvnic ) mach numbers ; from larson s relations ( larson 1981 ) we expect larger scales to correspond to larger rms mach numbers .    to recover the completely self  similar result we consider two experiments with identical initial conditions ( also with respect to mach numbers and average gas density ) , but interpreted at different scales @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the total mass in the `` large scale '' experiment is obviously @xmath95 larger than in the `` small scale '' experiment .",
    "the cores in the large scale experiment would be equal in number , but heavier by the ratio @xmath95 than cores in the small scale experiment .",
    "on the other hand , the total number of cores in the small scale experiment is @xmath95 larger than in the large scale experiment , if the same total mass is used in the two cases ( that is if cores from a number @xmath95 of small scale experiments are counted together ) .",
    "the result is therefore a total number of cores that depends on scale as : @xmath96 in agreement with elmegreen s ( 1997 ) result .",
    "when the mach number dependence on scale is taken into account the result is that the larger scales contribute relatively less massive cores , because of the scaling relation ( [ m2 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the number of cores per scale @xmath12 still scales as @xmath97 . combining the relations ( [ m2 ] ) and ( [ nl ] ) we obtain : @xmath98 if the spectral index is consistent with the observed velocity dispersion  size larson relation ( larson 1981 ) and with our numerical and analytical results ( boldyrev , nordlund & padoan 2001 ) , then @xmath0 and the mass distribution is @xmath99 which is almost identical to the salpeter stellar imf ( salpeter 1955 ) .",
    "the mass distribution of dense cores has been computed assuming that the pre  shock density is @xmath59 and the postshock density @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is scale dependent .",
    "a more precise computation should include the effect of the probability distribution of the value of @xmath101 at each scale , or the overall effect of the statistics of the turbulent velocity field , which is the generation of a log  normal pdf of mass density ( see   4 ) .",
    "this is necessary to compute the fraction of dense cores that are gravitationally unstable and collapse into protostars , since dense cores can be significantly denser than their average density predicted by the scaling laws . while most of the large cores will be dense enough to collapse , the probability that small cores are dense enough to collapse is determined by the pdf of mass density .",
    "because of the intermittent nature of the log  normal pdf , even very small ( sub  stellar ) cores have a finite chance to be dense enough to collapse .",
    "we write the thermal jeans mass as : @xmath102 where : @xmath103 is the jeans mass at the mean density @xmath59 .",
    "the distribution of the jeans mass is obtained from the pdf of density assuming constant temperature as in padoan , nordlund & jones ( 1997 ) : @xmath104 d\\ln m_j , \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is in solar masses , and : @xmath106 the fraction of cores of mass @xmath68 with gravitational energy in excess of their thermal energy is given by the integral of @xmath107 from 0 to @xmath68 .",
    "the mass distribution of collapsing cores is therefore @xmath108\\,d\\ln m \\label{imfpdf}\\ ] ]    = 1    the mass distribution is plotted in figure  1 , for @xmath86 . in the top panel",
    "the mass distribution is computed for three different values of the largest turbulent scale @xmath78 , assuming larson type relations ( larson 1981 ) to rescale @xmath59 and @xmath109 according to the value of @xmath78 .",
    "the mass distribution is a power law , determined by the power spectrum of turbulence , for masses larger than approximately 1 m@xmath83 . at smaller masses",
    "the mass distribution flattens , reaches a maximum at a fraction of a solar mass , and then decreases with decreasing stellar mass . collapsing sub ",
    "stellar masses are found , thanks to the intermittent density distribution in the turbulent flow .",
    "the middle and bottom panel of figure  1 show the dependence of the mass distribution on the rms mach number of the flow and on the average gas density respectively .",
    "the magnetic critical mass is derived in the next section .",
    "we have not used it here to obtain the mass distribution of collapsing cores because the thermal jeans s mass is a more strict condition for collapse .",
    "the magnetic critical mass depends on the core morphology in relation to the field geometry and on the magnetic field strength that correlates with the gas density with a very large scatter ( see below ) .",
    "it is possible therefore that magnetic pressure support against the gravitational collapse affects the shape of the mass distribution , but only as a secondary effect .",
    "observations show that the stellar imf is a power law above 12 m@xmath83 , with exponent around the salpeter value @xmath3 , roughly independent of environment ( elmegreen 1998 , 2000 ) , gradually flattens at smaller masses , and peaks at approximately 0.20.6 m@xmath83 ( hillenbrand 1997 ; bouvier et al .",
    "1998 ; luhman 1999 ; luhman & rieke 1999 ; luhman 2000 ; luhman et al .",
    "the shape of the imf below 12 m@xmath83 , and particularly the relative abundance of brown dwarfs , may depend on the physical environment ( luhman 2000 ) .",
    "the scalings discussed above result in a mass distribution of dense cores consistent with the stellar imf for masses larger than 1 m@xmath83 , without invoking a sampling rate proportional to the free fall time , or `` competition for mass '' as in elmegreen ( 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "two conclusions are possible ; either there are effects in addition to those considered by elmegreen , and they all happen to cancel each other , or else additional effects are not important in the first place . in the spirit of occam ,",
    "let s consider the latter possibility .",
    "if , as argued elsewhere by elmegreen ( 2000a ) , star formation essentially happens in a crossing time , then we may indeed see only one generation of stars being produced at each scale , rather than the repeated process implied by scaling with the local dynamical time .",
    "the picture thus is one where a particular mc forms as a consequence of the random intersection of counter - streaming , super  sonic motions ( ballesteros  paredes , hartmann & vzquez ",
    "semadeni 1999 ; hartmann , ballesteros ",
    "paredes & bergin 2001 ) , internal turbulence creates the distribution of core masses derived above , and the cores are then grabbed by gravitation to form one generation of stars .",
    "energy feedback from stars subsequently disperses the cloud before the process has time to repeat .    in the process",
    "envisaged above , turbulent fragmentation is responsible for creating the core mass distribution , while gravity is only responsible for the collapse of each protostar .",
    "the flattening and the turn around of the imf is also easily accounted for in such a model .",
    "while scale  free turbulence generates a power law mass distribution down to very small masses , only cores with a gravitational binding energy in excess of their magnetic and thermal energy can collapse .",
    "the shape of the stellar imf is then determined by the pdf of gas density , that is by the probability of small cores to be dense enough to collapse .",
    "the mass distribution of collapsing cores derived in the previous section and based on the log  normal pdf of mass density is indeed consistent with the observed imf .",
    "the scaling of the mass where the imf peaks can be derived without a knowledge of the pdf of mass density , using the scaling laws and the definition of the critical mass for collapse .",

    "padoan & nordlund ( 1999 ) have shown that super  sonic and super  alfvnic turbulence generates a correlation between gas density and magnetic field strength , consistent with the observational data .",
    "the two most important properties of such a @xmath113@xmath114 relation are the very large scatter , and the power law upper envelope ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "more recently , padoan et al .  ( 2001b ) have computed the magnetic field strength in dense cores produced in numerical simulations of self  gravitating , super  sonic and super  alfvnic turbulence .",
    "they found typical field strength as a function of column density in agreement with new compilations of observational samples by crutcher ( 1999 ) and bourke et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . here",
    "we adopt the following empirical @xmath113@xmath114 relation consistent with our previous works : @xmath116 where the exponent is @xmath117 , and not @xmath118 as reported above , because we now refer to the average values of @xmath113 inside bins of @xmath114 , and not to the upper envelope of the @xmath113@xmath114 relation , as above .",
    "the slight steepening is due to the fact that the lower envelope of the @xmath113@xmath114 relation is steeper than the upper envelope .",
    "note that ( [ bn ] ) is a statistical relation between the average magnetic field strength as a function of core density , while eqs .",
    "( [ mhdn ] ) and ( [ mhdb ] ) are fundamental shock jump relations .",
    "flows along magnetic field lines are able to alter the ratio of mass to magnetic flux in regions upstream of shocks , resulting in the ensemble that ( [ bn ] ) characterizes .",
    "both relations are valid , and enter into the derivation of the critical mass .",
    "we find the critical mass by imposing @xmath119 , where @xmath68 is given by equation ( [ m2 ] ) , and @xmath120 by equation ( [ mb ] ) , @xmath121 for @xmath86 , we get @xmath122    the critical mass is therefore typically a few times smaller than the critical mass at the average density . for @xmath89 , @xmath123  @xmath124 and @xmath125  @xmath126 g , the critical mass is approximately @xmath127  m@xmath83 .",
    "@xmath126 g provides a normalization of the @xmath113@xmath114 relation consistent with the results of our super - alfvnic numerical simulations discussed in padoan & nordlund ( 1999 ) and in padoan et al .",

    "the probability that cores smaller than this mass are larger than their critical mass decreases with decreasing core mass , which could produce some flattening of the stellar imf .",
    "because of the large scatter in the @xmath113@xmath114 relation the magnetic critical mass does not define a sharp cut - off in the imf , but rather a gradual flattening .",
    "a sharper mass scale is defined by the jeans mass in the cores , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the jeans mass at the average density defined in ( [ mj ] ) . for @xmath89 , @xmath130  @xmath124 ,",
    "@xmath131  k and @xmath86 , the thermal critical mass is approximately @xmath118  m@xmath83 .",
    "therefore , using physical parameters typical of nearby molecular clouds , the present model predicts that the imf should gradually flatten below approximately 2 m@xmath83 and peak in a ( logarithmic ) neighborhood of 0.4 m@xmath83 , due to increasing thermal pressure support at smaller masses ( cores smaller than their jeans mass are not included in the mass distribution ) .    this result is consistent with the analytic expression of the imf derived in the previous section based of the density pdf .",
    "as can be seen in figure  1 , the imf peaks at approximately @xmath118  m@xmath83 , for @xmath132 , @xmath130  @xmath124 , @xmath131  k and @xmath86 .      in",
    "  5 we have estimated the largest mass of dense cores formed by the process of turbulent fragmentation , given by the expression ( [ mmax ] ) .",
    "the largest stellar mass should also be of the order of @xmath133 . assuming that the turbulent velocities are of the order of the virial velocities in the parent molecular cloud , and adopting the larson relation @xmath134 ( larson 1981 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath135 .",
    "this is close to the empirical relation @xmath136 ( larson 1982 ) , which is found for a cloud sample known to follow the above size  density relation .",
    "it is likely that the true exponent of this relation is slightly larger than the value found by larson ( 1982 ) , because the lifetime of the most massive stars is comparable to , or shorter than , the lifetime of their parent molecular clouds , and therefore the probability of observing the most massive stars decreases with increasing mass .",
    "elmegreen ( 1993 , 1997 ) has argued that the largest stellar mass is related to the mass of the parent cloud for purely statistical reasons : the larger the cloud mass is , the higher the probability of populating the high mass tail of the imf .",
    "such a statistical argument is correct only if the normalization of the imf is independent of the total cloud mass .",
    "the scalings derived above show that this is not the case ; larger clouds in general have larger velocities and therefore form relatively fewer stars of a given mass .",
    "this is also indicated by observations , since it is commonly found that larger clouds have lower star formation efficiency than smaller clouds .",
    "however , since the star formation efficiency also depends on the low mass cut - off of the imf , and since age differences also may enter , it would have been hard to draw firm conclusions from observations alone .",
    "in section [ coremass ] we found that the mass distribution of dense cores formed by turbulent fragmentation has a power law shape , with a slope consistent with the stellar imf at intermediate and large masses , and in section [ collapse ] we found the distribution of the mass of collapsing cores , which has a shape consistent with the observed imf also at small masses .",
    "three assumptions were essential for the derivation , and we would here like to emphasize what these assumptions are , and point out that they are independent of each other .",
    "the first assumption is that approximate selfsimilarity holds for supersonic turbulence of varying mach number , to the extent that the scaling of the number of cores with upstream scale @xmath12 scales as @xmath97 , also when the mach number varies with scale @xmath12 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because the compressed cores occupy only a tiny fraction of the volume where their mass was collected from .",
    "the second assumption is that the mass of the compressed cores scales as the cube of the thickness of the shocked gas , which again scales as the inverse of the mach number .",
    "this assumption is independent of the particular density and scale of the upstream flow , and rests only on the fundamental shock jump condition and on the core shape being independent of mach number .",
    "the third assumption is that the mach number of the upstream gas depends on the scale @xmath12 of the upstream flow as @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is essentially the index in larson s ( 1979 , 1981 ) velocity  size relation .",
    "it is remarkable that , under these assumptions , an imf slope consistent with salpeter s ( 1955 ) value is obtained as a direct result of the observed velocity dispersion ",
    "size relation of ism turbulence and the fundamental jump conditions for isothermal mhd shocks .",
    "provided that some general criteria are met , the slope of the stellar imf is thus independent of the physical conditions in the star  forming clouds , as also indicated by the observations ( elmegreen 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "we have also interpreted the gradual flattening of the imf around 12 m@xmath83 and its peak at approximately 0.30.5 m@xmath83 as the effect of thermal ( possibly also magnetic ) support against the gravitational collapse .",
    "the mass distribution of collapsing cores , computed on the basis of the pdf of mass density and the thermal jeans mass , is consistent with the observed stellar imf , down to sub",
    " stellar masses .",
    "we have shown that the imf at low stellar masses is sensitive to the average physical properties of the star forming gas , such as the rms mach number and the average gas density , also consistent with the observations ( luhman 2000 ) .",
    "an even larger number of sub ",
    "stellar objects would be predicted if a significant fraction of them originate as close companions of more massive stars and later on separate as individual brown dwarfs . in the present work we do not study the evolution of density fluctuations smaller than their jeans mass within the collapsing background of an unstable larger core , and therefore this mechanism for the formation of giant planets and brown dwarfs is not discussed here .",
    "the assumption behind the result is that the upstream density is sampled from a log - normal density distribution , and that the distribution of the densities of cores therefore also is approximately log - normal .",
    "an exact log - normal density distribution requires exactly isothermal conditions , but even for non - isothermal conditions the central part of the density pdf is still approximately log - normal ( scalo et .",
    "al 1998 , nordlund & padoan 1999 ) .",
    "given the fact that turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable in super  sonic turbulence , and given the success of the present model in predicting the correct slope of the stellar imf , it is difficult to argue that super  sonic turbulence does not play a dominant role in the generation of the stellar imf .",
    "other processes such as gravitational fragmentation ( larson 1973 ; elmegreen & mathieu 1983 ; zinnecker 1984 ) , opacity limited fragmentation ( hoyle 1953 ; gaustad 1963 ; yoneyama 1972 ; suchkov & shchekinov 1976 ; low & lynden - bell 1976 ; rees 1976 ; yoshii & saio 1985 ; silk 1977a , b ) , protostar interactions and coagulation ( nakano 1966 ; arny & weissman 1973 ; silk & takahashi 1979 ; bastien 1981 ; yoshii & saio 1985 ; lejeune & bastien 1986 ; allen & bastien 1995 , 1996 ; price & podsiadlowski 1995 ; murray & lin 1996 ) , stellar winds and outflows ( silk 1995 ; nakano , hasegawa & norman 1995 ; adams & fatuzzo 1996 ) , competitive accretion ( larson 1978 ; tohline 1980 ; bonnell et al .  1997 ; myers 2000 ) must be relatively unimportant .    this conclusion is supported by a recent computation of the mass distribution of dense self  gravitating cores in numerical simulations of self  gravitating super  sonic mhd turbulence ( padoan et al .",
    "the result is a power law mass distribution consistent with the stellar imf .",
    "mass distributions of cores from numerical simulations of super  sonic turbulence , roughly consistent with the stellar imf , are also reported by klessen ( 2000 ) .",

    "paredes & bergin 2001 ) , may be a manifestation of a process analogous to the one discussed above , just operating on a larger scale .",
    "if motions on larger scales are also characterized by power laws , one would then expect the distribution of mc masses to obey a salpeter - like scaling",
    ". however , such scaling would be rather difficult to probe observationally , due to the fact that mcs are dispersed by the process of star formation before they are able to collapse as a whole , which prevents them from being well defined as individual objects .    for almost twenty years estimates of the mass distribution of dense cores in molecular clouds ,",
    "based on molecular  line studies , found a shallow power law mass distribution with a single exponent in the range @xmath139 , with a typical value @xmath140 .",
    "the main reasons for the shallow mass distribution obtained in these works are i ) the relatively low density traced by the molecular emission lines normally used ( @xmath141  @xmath124 for @xmath142co , and @xmath143  @xmath124 for c@xmath144o ) ; ii ) the limited density range probed by each molecular emission line ; iii ) the use of inappropriate `` clump  find '' algorithms ; iv ) the relatively low resolution that allows only the selection of large cores , with typical mass ranging from @xmath145  m@xmath83 to hundreds or thousands m@xmath83 .",
    "clearly , cores selected in this way can not be identified with single protostellar cores , as discussed in padoan ( 1995 ) , where it was predicted that the exponent of the intrinsic mass distribution of protostellar cores should have been @xmath146 , based on the stellar imf .",

    "detailed studies of pre ",
    "stellar cores selected in this way could provide accurate volume density measurements and therefore a test for the density  size relation implied by our equation ( [ m ] ) .",
    "note , however , that because all quantities involved have wide distribution functions it is important to distinguish between average or typical values , extreme values , and observed values . the latter may often be more representative of extreme values than of average values .",
    "one example is larson s density  size relation , which by its nature tends to refer to the densest cores of a given size rather than the average cores of that size ; many low density cores may exist that are unobservable , or are ignored .    in the context of our derivation and assumptions",

    "in conclusion , we have related the stellar imf to the mass distribution of dense cores formed by the process of turbulent fragmentation , assuming that only cores with gravitational energy in excess of their magnetic and thermal energy can collapse as protostars .",

    "we have also shown that another fundamental physical property of turbulent flows , namely the pdf of the gas density , can explain the shape of the imf at smaller stellar masses , and the formation of gravitationally unstable cores of sub  stellar mass .",
