    "the periodic variations in ttss are believed to occur due to the axial rotation of a star with an inhomogeneous surface , having either hot or cool spots ( herbst et al .",

    "herbst et al . ( 1994 ) identified three types of day to weeks timescale variability in ttss .",

    "the rare type iii variations are characterized by luminosity dips lasting from a few days up to several months , which presumably result from circumstellar dust obscuration .",
    "the majority of the pms variables detected in the present study have masses @xmath3 3 m@xmath5 and these variables could be ttss .",

    "the spectral energy distributions of v13 and v15 indicate ir excess , and h@xmath7 emission in the case of v15 , suggesting circumstellar disks .",
    "edwards et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that the stars whose @xmath29 colours indicating the presence of circumstellar disks rotate slower than whose @xmath29 colours indicate the absence of an accretion disk .",
    "the period estimates for wttss vary from 0.15 day to 34.73 day .",
    "the amplitude in case of cttss has a range of 0.07 to 0.99 mag , while amplitude of wttss varies from 0.02 to 0.35 mag .",
    "this indicates that the brightness of cttss varies with larger amplitude in comparison to wttss .",
    "this result is in agreement with that by grankin et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) and by lata et al .",
    "the larger amplitude in the case of cttss could be due to presence of hot spots on the stellar surface produced by accretion mechanism .",
    "hot spots cover a small fraction of the stellar surface but with a high temperature causing larger amplitude of brightness variations ( carpenter et al .",
    "the smaller amplitude in wttss suggests dissipation of their circumstellar disks or these stars might have cool spots on their surface which are produced due to convection and differential rotation of star and magnetic field .    in the present study",

    "its period ( 0.31 day ) is similar to that of w uma - type eclipsing binary .",
    "the shape of the light curve also resembles a w uma - type variable star , hence it could be a - type w uma binary star .",

    "it shows h@xmath7 emission .",
    "it is a periodic variable with amplitude of 0.16 mag with a period 0.15 day .",
    "however its individual night observations on 2008 october 29 and 2010 november 27 give the period of 0.15 and 0.17 day respectively .",
    "its variability characteristics are rather similar to a pulsating pms star .",
    "its absolute magnitude and intrinsic @xmath31 colour put it on the pulsation strip in the @xmath26 diagram where @xmath32 scuti stars are expected to be located .",

    "its spectral type f0 iii - iv ( marco & negueruela 2002 ) also suggests an rr lyrae type variable .",

    "alternatively , they argued that the location of the stars in the cmd is not primarily a function of age , but of accretion history .",

    "it is worthwhile to point out that the study by littlefair et al .",

    "<S> we present results of multi - epoch ( fourteen nights during 2007 - 2010 ) @xmath0-band photometry of the cluster ngc 1893 region to identify photometric variable stars in the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the study identified a total of 53 stars showing photometric variability . </S>",
    "<S> the members associated with the region are identified on the basis of spectral energy distribution , @xmath1 two colour diagram and @xmath2 colour - magnitude diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the ages and masses of the majority of pre - main - sequence sources are found to be @xmath3 5 myr and in the range 0.5 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath3 4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these pre - main - sequence sources hence could be t tauri stars . </S>",
    "<S> we also determined the physical parameters like disk mass and accretion rate from the spectral energy distribution of these t tauri stars . </S>",
    "<S> the periods of majority of the t tauri stars range from 0.1 to 20 day . </S>",
    "<S> the brightness of classical t tauri stars is found to vary with larger amplitude in comparison to weak line t tauri stars . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the amplitude decreases with increase in mass , which could be due to the dispersal of disks of massive stars .    </S>",
