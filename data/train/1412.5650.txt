    "geodesic motion in a schwarzschild field is one of introductory exercises in general relativity .",
    "the motion being completely integrable and planar ( usually laid at @xmath1 ) , its exact solution is mostly expressed as a @xmath2 dependence .",
    "however , this involves elliptic integrals @xcite and may be quite uncomfortable if one needs to invert the result for @xmath3 or for some parameter ( usually the impact parameter ) .",
    "the solution for radius ( or its reciprocal ) as a function of angle was only given later @xcite using elliptic functions .",
    "in particular , null geodesics ( photon world - lines ) have been treated notably by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , a _ simple and easily invertible _ approximation of the relativistic photon trajectories seems yet to be suggested .",
    "although light bending has been treated at many places , usually the _",
    "total bending angle _ is the aim ( given by directions at the source and observer locations , or just by radial asymptotics ) , especially when the exercise is treated in connection with gravitational lensing  see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ( recently the discussion has been mainly focused on the effect of the cosmological constant , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . instead , we would like to reasonably approximate _ whole trajectories _ , which is of course more delicate .",
    "( an even higher level would also incorporate proper _ timing _ , which is also important , but we restrict this study to spatial trajectories . ) actually , one learns quickly that formulas obtained by linearization in some parameter do not reproduce well the strong - field behaviour , while , on the contrary ,  improving \" this by hand tends to spoil their weak - field limit .",
    "low - order prescriptions typically do not provide sufficient bending in the centre s vicinity and sufficiently quick straightening at larger distances , so even if they may be adjusted to have a correct pericentre radius as well as asymptotic directions , their overall shape is often far from satisfactory .",
    "below , we first recall basic equations and fix parameterization of the problem ( section [ schwarzschild ] ) . in section",
    "[ approximation ] , several simple approximations of light rays , resulting from quite different approaches , are listed and their basic properties reviewed .",
    "their performance at different radii is illustrated then and compared numerically with that of our simple suggestion presented ( section [ examples ] ) , showing that the latter is very accurate , even including trajectories with pericentres slightly below @xmath4 .",
    "although we primarily focus on the behaviour of the approximations at finite radii from the central black hole , section [ asymptotic - angle ] shows what answers the best of them give for an asymptotic angle along which the photons approach radial infinity . in section [ lensing - exercise ] we illustrate the practical usage of our formula for solving the ray - deflection exercise , again with results almost identical to those obtained ( purely numerically ) from an exact treatment .",
    "observations made are then briefly summarized in concluding remarks .",
    "mainly to fix notation , let us recall basic equations of the exact problem .",
    "using schwarzschild coordinates @xmath5 and geometrized units ( in which @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , we consider metric in the standard form @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "geodesic motion in the spherically symmetric field being planar , let us choose the orbital plane to be the equatorial one ( @xmath1 ) . in such a case , the photon four - momentum has non - zero components @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the photon s energy , angular momentum and impact parameter , respectively , all remaining conserved along the ray ; the sign @xmath14 fixes the orientation of radial motion ( while that of azimuthal motion is determined by the sign of @xmath15 ) .",
    "let us focus on photons with @xmath16 which have a ( one ) turning point of radial motion , either pericentre ( which is always above @xmath17 ) or apocentre ( which is always below @xmath17 ) .",
    "move from infinity to the centre or vice versa without any radial turning .",
    "] let us then adjust , without loss of generality , the coordinates so that a given photon reaches this turning point at @xmath18 .",
    "the ray thus gets symmetric with respect to the meridional plane @xmath19 and it is sufficient to only consider its half starting from that plane .",
    "the vanishing of radial momentum at @xmath18 constrains the constants of motion by the condition @xmath20 where @xmath21 indicates the radius at the turning point of radial motion and @xmath22 .",
    "equations for @xmath23 and @xmath24 give @xmath25 which can further be expressed in terms of the extremal radius @xmath26 , @xmath27 this second form is more complicated , but it turns out to be much more suitable for integration .",
    "assuming , without loss of generality , that we focus on the half of the trajectory which starts toward positive @xmath28 from @xmath18 ( briefly , we assume @xmath29 ) , the integration gives ( see @xcite or @xcite , formula ( 260 ) in chapter 3 ) @xmath30^{1/4 } }       \\left[k(k)-f(\\chi , k)\\right ]   \\label{phi(r ) } \\\\    & = \\frac{2\\,\\sqrt{r_0}}{[(r_0 - 2m)(r_0 + 6m)]^{1/4}}\\ ;       f(\\chi',k ) \\",
    ", , \\label{phi(r)'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the elliptic integral of the 1st kind , with amplitude @xmath32 and modulus @xmath33 given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 is its complete version .",
    "one can check immediately that @xmath36 only reduces to @xmath37 at the turning point , where @xmath38 and so @xmath39 , which correctly yields @xmath40 .",
    "the second expression ( [ phi(r) ] ) contains a different amplitude @xmath41 which is related to @xmath32 by @xmath42 ( while @xmath33 remains unprimed in both expressions ) .",
    "we add that the complementary modulus @xmath43 , which is related to @xmath33 by @xmath44 , is given by the same expression ( [ 2k2 ] ) as @xmath33 , just with _ plus _ after 1 ; their product is therefore quite short , @xmath45    with our parametrization , the azimuth @xmath28 of a photon increases monotonically from zero . for a photon starting ( from @xmath18 ) from @xmath46",
    "the azimuth can finally reach very large values ; with @xmath26 growing from @xmath47 to infinity the asymptotic azimuth decreases from infinity to @xmath48 , while with @xmath26 shrinking from @xmath17 toward @xmath49 the photon falls through the horizon at @xmath28 quickly decreasing from infinity toward zero .",
    "the exact darwin s formula ( [ phi(r ) ] ) is quite simple , yet it is not easy to invert it for @xmath3 and mainly for @xmath26 ( which would in turn yield constants of the motion as functions of @xmath50 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "such a problem is typically encountered when asking  what are the parameters of the light / photons that arrive at a given location from some ( which ? ) points of a given source ? \" ( in the schwarzschild field ) .",
    "namely , the source generally emits photons of various different parameters ( from different starting points , with different energies , in different directions , etc . ) , of which each follows a different world - line . when studying some radiation - influenced process at a given location outside the source , it is first necessary to find _ which _ of the photons get to that location ( which means to find from where in the source they started ) and then to infer what are their properties ( in order to be able to say what will be their effect ) .",
    "an important system that raises such questions is an accretion disc around a black hole , because i ) its inner part is a powerful source of radiation which strongly affects matter around ( on the other hand , the disc can be significantly irradiated by a hot  corona \" , and possibly even self - irradiated ) , and ii ) the inner part of the disc lies in a very strong gravitational field where the propagation of light is not trivial ( linear ) . to give a specific example",
    ", we came across the demand to invert darwin s formula for @xmath26 when studying , in schwarzschild space - time , the motion of test particles influenced by a radiation field emitted from the equatorial plane in a perpendicular direction ( such a pattern was considered to approximate the radiation generated by an equatorial thin disc )  see @xcite .",
    "in such an arrangement , one needs to find the impact parameters of the ( two )  vertical \" photons interacting with the particle at a given location , which precisely requires one to find the @xmath26 s from where those photons started .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to look for an approximation of photon trajectories which would be simple , invertible for @xmath26 , yet reasonably accurate . in particular",
    ", it should work well for as small a radius ( @xmath26 ) as possible , because in real astrophysical situations there is often much radiation just quite close to the horizon .",
    "this is natural since matter inflows into these regions with extremely high speeds , so collisions of its streams dissipate huge amounts of energy which intensively outflow as radiation .",
    "in particular , real accretion discs are supposed to radiate most from their innermost regions which probably reach to the innermost stable circular geodesic at @xmath51 or even below .",
    "a natural starting attempt for how to simplify the inversion problem is to linearize the exact formula in some small parameter .",
    "we have either @xmath52 or @xmath53 , with @xmath54 anyway .",
    "clearly the @xmath55 case is more astrophysically interesting .",
    "then the relation between @xmath50 and @xmath56 changes in time : the photon starts from @xmath57 , but quickly gets to @xmath58 ( and then even to @xmath59 ) .",
    "surely @xmath0 is the least of all parameters and hence the usual linearization in it .",
    "however , the weak - field approximations  like the one obtained by linearization in @xmath0  generally yield trajectories ",
    "less bent about \" the central gravitating body , since the centre s field is weakened effectively .",
    "if such an approximation is employed for the inversion of the @xmath60 formula for @xmath26 , it may lead to errors when applied to strongly bent rays . actually :",
    "adopt our parametrization , i.e. , adjust the plane @xmath18 so that the ray crosses it (  starts from it \" ) in a perpendicular direction ( it is purely azimuthal there ) .",
    "now , imagine a photon approaching @xmath61 ( from @xmath62 ) while having a small radius : it must have started ( purely tangentially ) from @xmath18 from a _ very small _",
    "radius @xmath26 in order for it to have been bent about the centre sufficiently . for such photons , weak - field approximations may easily yield a starting radius @xmath26 even lying _ below horizon _",
    "( note that there is actually no horizon in most such approximations ) , which may then bring errors if substituted into the schwarzschild - metric lapse function @xmath63 .",
    "one could surely improve the approximation by taking into account higher order(s ) of the small - parameter expansion , but higher - order formulas mostly can_not _ be inverted easily . restricting oneself to low - order formulas , one can resort to some more ",
    "pragmatic \" construct instead .",
    "first ,  pseudo - newtonian \" descriptions are often employed in the astrophysical literature , based on the newtonian potential suitably modified to mimic certain features of the actual relativistic field .",
    "second , our particular problem of scattering - type light trajectories can be approximated by a hyperbola adjusted to the desired asymptotic directions . and third , one can try to design a suitable formula  by hand \" , simply observing the main properties it should reproduce .",
    "however , all such ad hoc formulas , not relying on any clearly justified procedure , must be handled with care ; in particular , even if they were successful close to the black hole ( or rather _ more if _ they were successful there ) , their weak - field ( large - radius ) behaviour may not be satisfactory .",
    "they can also hardly yield trustful replies for tiny , velocity - dependent ( dragging ) , non - stationary , radiation etc .",
    "effects , but in the simple case of static space - times , they have mostly proved quite practical .",
    "let us compare the above possibilities , including mainly several successful suggestions from literature .",
    "darwin s formula ( [ phi(r ) ] ) can be linearized in @xmath0 to obtain @xmath64 clearly @xmath18 corresponds to @xmath38 correctly , while for @xmath65 one has asymptotics @xmath66 which is always @xmath67 ( so @xmath68 which means that the ray s half - bending is less than @xmath69 ) .",
    "the linear part can easily be inverted for @xmath26 .",
    "although the treatments on lensing mostly aim at the total deflection angle , some of them also provide prescription for the photon trajectory . both are usually obtained by perturbative solution of the well - known binet formula which in the null case reads @xmath70 let us mention three of them .",
    "@xcite solved the equation up to linear order by , so we must shift their formulas by @xmath48 . ]",
    "@xmath71 in their equation ( 14 ) .",
    "clearly @xmath72 as it should be and solving for @xmath73 yields ( [ darwin , lin ] ) in linear order .",
    "a slightly different linear - order solution was given by @xcite ( their equation ( 5 ) ) , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a length whose meaning follows by setting @xmath18 ( and @xmath38 ) : @xmath76 solving this for @xmath75 , substituting above and linearizing in @xmath0 , one has @xmath77 although this differs from ( [ biressaf , lin ] ) , its solution for @xmath73 again agrees with ( [ darwin , lin ] ) in linear order .",
    "finally , let us turn to @xcite who presented a second - order solution in their equation ( 7 ) , @xmath78 the corresponding equation expressed in terms of @xmath26 follows by substituting ( [ el - constraint ] ) for @xmath56 and expanding in @xmath0 accordingly , @xmath79 in linear order this reduces to ( [ bhadrabs , lin ] ) and its @xmath18 form @xmath80 properly yields @xmath38 . inversion for @xmath56 or @xmath26 is of course more uncomfortable if keeping the second order in @xmath0 .      in newton",
    "s theory , the motion of test particles in the velocity - independent spherical potential @xmath81 is also confined to a plane ( which we again identify with @xmath1 ) and described by @xmath82 these equations have usual integrals of energy and angular momentum @xmath83 which invert for velocities as @xmath84 the ratio of the velocities gives an equivalent of the relativistic equation ( [ dphi / dr ] ) , @xmath85^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath86 will again be chosen below .",
    "should the trajectory be strictly tangential ( azimuthal ) at @xmath18 ( @xmath87 at @xmath38 ) , it has to satisfy the condition @xmath88    besides the overall caution in following the pseudo - newtonian approach , it is also necessary to distinguish between various potentials proposed in the literature , because different ones are suitable for different purposes ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the paczyski - wiita potential @xmath89 is a most simple and efficient mimicker of the schwarzschild field , whose main advantages are correct values of important circular geodesics , so it is mainly suitable for modeling accretion discs .",
    "however , if plugged into the above , the resulting equation for @xmath90 is not easier to integrate than its relativistic counter - part .",
    "the same also applies to the nowak - wagoner quadratic - expansion potential @xmath91 which has often proved the best of the  simple \" suggestions .",
    "it is clear from equation ( [ dphi / dr , pseudo ] ) that for its integration to be simpler than that of the relativistic case ( [ dphi / dr ] ) , the resulting polynomial under the square root has to be exactly quadratic in @xmath50 .",
    "this is the case if the potential is of the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is some constant .",
    "such a form has been advocated by @xcite , specifically with @xmath94 .",
    "equation ( [ dphi / dr , pseudo ] ) supplied with the initial condition @xmath95 is then ( with the above form of the potential ) solved by @xmath96 where we introduced the dimensionless constant @xmath97    the pseudo - newtonian picture is doubly problematic when describing photons , in particular , their speed can not be considered constant . however , choosing their _ initial _ linear speed to be equal to one , which means @xmath98 in our case when photons start in a pure azimuthal direction , one has @xmath99 so , if @xmath100 , which holds for @xmath101 ; for @xmath102 this means @xmath103 , which is not so bad . ]",
    "the equatorial trajectory can be rewritten as @xmath104 clearly @xmath105 correctly and the asymptotic value at radial infinity amounts to @xmath106    when speaking about asymptotics , it should be stressed that photons exist which remain bound on  elliptic - type \" orbits .",
    "actually , recalling equations ( [ velocities ] ) , we see that @xmath87 if @xmath107 , which after substitution of our @xmath108 , @xmath109 implies @xmath110 , i.e. , with @xmath94 and expanded , @xmath111=0.\\ ] ] besides the automatic zero at @xmath38 , this also has a second root at @xmath112 however , this root is only relevant in a narrow interval @xmath113 ( it grows from @xmath49 to infinity very fast within this range ) .",
    "there is one case of particular interest within the above range of @xmath26 : using @xmath114 back in the first of equations ( [ ddot : r , phi ] ) , we have @xmath115 which specifically for @xmath94 reads @xmath116 and thus implies that @xmath117 at @xmath118 . therefore , the potential ( [ potential - wegg ] ) with @xmath94 correctly reproduces the schwarzschild circular photon geodesic ( which indicates that it may be successful in simulating photon motion in the innermost region ) .      another possibility is to approximate the photon trajectory by a suitable hyperbola .",
    "placing its focus at @xmath119 and its vertex at ( @xmath18 , @xmath38 ) , and prescribing some asymptotic azimuth @xmath120 , it is given by the equation @xmath121 now @xmath120 can be prescribed somehow , for example chosen according to the exact formula . however , since the latter makes the above expression uncomfortably long , let us instead illustrate it with @xmath120 provided by the beloborodov formula ( see next subsection ) , i.e. with @xmath122 ( which proved quite accurate ) : @xmath123 the limit possibility is to choose @xmath124 which yields the parabola @xmath125      a simple approximation of photon trajectories has been provided by @xcite in his formula ( 3 ) , @xmath126 where the position angle @xmath127 is measured ( from the centre ) so that @xmath128 fixes the asymptotic escape direction ( with all the orbit having @xmath129 , so the photon is considered to move _ against _ the @xmath127 orientation ) .",
    "the value of @xmath127 at pericentre ( @xmath130 ) is determined by @xmath131 and lies between @xmath48 and @xmath132 .",
    "the angle @xmath133 represents the total bending angle ; @xmath134 is the asymptotic _ ingoing _ direction if the trajectory is extended to infinity in both directions ( see figure [ ray - description ] ) .",
    "beloborodov derived the above result from the elegant equation @xmath135 which pretty accurately approximates the relation between the photon s momentary radius @xmath50 , position angle @xmath127 and the local direction of flight measured by the angular deflection from the radial direction in a local static frame , @xmath93 .",
    "( how to understand the success of this  cosine relation \" is explained in section 2 of @xcite . ) the local direction @xmath93 is given by the photon momentum , @xmath136 so one has , by solving equation ( [ alpha - r , psi ] ) for @xmath137 and then substituting for @xmath138 , @xmath139 this increases monotonically from @xmath140 at pericentre through zero to positive values and approaches unity at @xmath65 .",
    "in our parametrization the photon has pericentre at @xmath18 and moves in a positive @xmath28 direction ( to some asymptotic @xmath141 ) , and hence the angles are related by @xmath142 ( see figure [ ray - description ] ) , which means @xmath143 hence , equating ( [ cos(psi),phi])=([cos(psi ) ] ) gives the implicit relation @xmath144 for the @xmath145 trajectory .",
    "the beloborodov s formula is only applicable at @xmath146 ( it yields @xmath124 for @xmath147 ) , but it really provides a very good approximation almost all the way down to there .",
    "it is less suitable for finding @xmath26 as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath148 , because the above relation yields for it an equation of the 16th ( or at least the 8th ) degree .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to suggest and test another ray - approximating formula , @xmath149 where @xmath93 and @xmath150 are real constants .",
    "it correctly gives @xmath151 at @xmath38 , its radial asymptotics reads @xmath152 and it can be inverted for @xmath26 as @xmath153 where @xmath154 the formula works reasonably within a certain range of parameters @xmath93 and @xmath150 and it is hard to say which particular combination is the best , because accuracy at small radii favours somewhat different values than accuracy farther away .",
    "we will specifically show that very good results are obtained with @xmath155 and @xmath156 , for example .",
    "as in the case of wegg s pseudo - newtonian potential ,  elliptic - type \" bound orbits do exist . since @xmath157",
    "this would require either @xmath158 , or @xmath159 .",
    "the latter would only hold for @xmath160 or @xmath161 , of which none applies with our choice of @xmath93 and @xmath150 ( namely , we always have @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) .",
    "hence , purely tangential motion can only happen at @xmath158 .",
    "this holds automatically at @xmath38 ( where @xmath164 ) , and it can also hold on the other side of the equatorial plane , @xmath165 . solving this equation for @xmath50 , one finds that for our constants @xmath155 , @xmath156 the solution grows very quickly from @xmath166 to infinity with @xmath26 increased from @xmath49 to @xmath167 ( this last value is valid generally and does not depend on @xmath150 ) .",
    "in other words , all photons launched from @xmath168 escape to infinity and have @xmath68 there , consistent with the asymptotic formula ( [ our - approximation , infty ] ) .      before embarking on a numerical comparison of the approximations with the exact formula ,",
    "let us further check their algebraic properties by expanding them in powers of @xmath0 . to be more specific ,",
    "let us thus expand @xmath169 .",
    "first , the cosine of the exact formula ( [ phi(r ) ] ) expands as @xmath170 where abbreviation has been used @xmath171    now to the approximations . of the prescriptions obtained from perturbative solution of the binet formula , we choose the result ( [ biressaf , lin ] ) by @xcite .",
    "when expressed in terms of @xmath73 , it expands as @xmath172 performing the same expansion with the pseudo - newtonian result ( [ wegg - trajectory ] ) involving wegg s potential @xmath173 , one obtains @xmath174 the hyperbola ( [ hyperbola ] ) , if  endowed with \" the exact asymptotic angle ( given by darwin s formula ) , expands to @xmath175 next approximation is the one owing to beloborodov s relation ( [ beloborodov - approx ] ) . solving the latter for @xmath73 and",
    "expanding as above , we get @xmath176 where @xmath177 finally , our formula ( [ our - approximation ] ) expands as @xmath178    as expected , the absolute term ( corresponding to a straight line ) is the same for all of the formulas .",
    "the linear terms are also common ( and corresponding to the expansion of the exact formula ) , except for the pseudo - newtonian formula and the hyperbola .",
    "the quadratic terms are somewhat longer , only in cases ( [ biressa , expansion ] ) , ( [ hyperbola , expansion ] ) and ( [ our , expansion ] ) they remain rather simple . in particular , notice that the expansion of our suggestion ( [ our , expansion ] ) is a generalization of the expansion ( [ biressa , expansion ] ) obtained from the approximate solution by @xcite .",
    "it is also seen that if our constants @xmath93 and @xmath150 are larger than 1 ( recall that we are actually suggesting the values @xmath155 , @xmath156 ) , then our quadratic term is bigger ( more negative ) and thus results in a trajectory more bent than the one provided by ( [ biressaf , lin ] ) .",
    "let us compare the above approximations of light rays passing at different distances from the centre ; we are even including those approaching the horizon very closely .",
    "since the approximate formulas are primarily required to excel at weak - field regions , they can not be expected to perform well down there .",
    "however , it is good to know where and how much they fail .",
    "in particular , when using such a formula in a code , it matters whether it is just very inaccurate , or rather yields complete nonsense that has to be discarded .",
    "numerical results are presented in four figures : figure [ comparison - near ] compares the approximations at small radii ( down to the very horizon ) , figure [ near - approximations ] illustrates the radius - dependence of all of them , figure [ comparison - far ] shows the behaviour at larger radii and [ total - deflection ] accompanies the remark [ asymptotic - angle ] on asymptotics ( hence total deflection angle ) added below .",
    "the figures demonstrate that the approximations obtained by low - order expansions of the exact formulas ( namely by linearization or quadratic expansion in @xmath0 ) are only usable for rays whose pericentres are above @xmath179 , say . below this radius ,",
    "all the  ad hoc \" prescriptions provide much better results , including the pseudo - newtonian one using the potential suggested by wegg .",
    "actually , the latter even provides _ the best _ results in a narrow region around the circular photon geodesic at @xmath17 since it reproduces its location exactly ; on the other hand , for pericentres at larger radii it is not as precise as other approximations , though it also falls off to zero deflection correctly .",
    "when the pericentre shifts below @xmath180 , even good approximations become rather problematic . the one by beloborodov is only usable above this radius , being not very accurate up to some @xmath181 .",
    "our newly suggested formula is very accurate almost everywhere , including the rays with pericentres slightly below @xmath180 , but at @xmath182 it also deviates from the correct behaviour , switching to  elliptic \" behaviour ( not at all present in the relativistic treatment , besides the circular photon orbit at @xmath17 ) which can only mimic the relativistic trajectories locally .",
    "note that the decisive value @xmath182 comes from @xmath183 , so it might be improved ( shifted down ) by choosing for our constant @xmath93 a value lower than @xmath184 , but this would almost certainly spoil the behaviour farther away .",
    "ad approximation by a hyperbola : rough as this idea may have seemed , the figures show that it reproduces the large - scale features of the rays very well when tied to a correct asymptotics . however , its bending about the black hole is not sharp enough and , also , just when endowed with _ correct",
    "_ asymptotics , it gets quite complicated and not invertible for @xmath26 .    finally , it is important that the two approximations which are satisfactory in general and can be used also below @xmath147 , namely our newly suggested formula ( [ our - approximation ] ) and the pseudo - newtonian result using wegg s potential , serve acceptably even there ( at @xmath185 ) , mainly they nowhere return _",
    "error_. above @xmath186 , the approximation by beloborodov remains a benchmark whose main advantage is the extraordinarily simple relation ( [ alpha - r , psi ] ) between the angular position on the trajectory and the latter s local direction .",
    "asymptotic behaviour of the approximations studied here is clearly visible in figure [ comparison - far ] , but let us add a special remark ( and figure ) comparing the @xmath120 values .",
    "it is of course useless to include the approximation by the hyperbola here , because , where applicable , its asymptotic angle has been _ prescribed _ by the correct ( exact ) value .",
    "therefore , we are left with the results following from the expansion of the exact formula or approximate solution of the binet formula , with the pseudo - newtonian result ( [ wegg , phi_infty ] ) using wegg s potential , with the asymptotics @xmath187 of beloborodov and with @xmath188 following from our formula suggested above .",
    "these asymptotic forms can naturally be inverted for @xmath26 easier than the general formulas describing the whole trajectory .",
    "inversion is especially simple for beloborodov s and our approximations , and also for the linearized solution of binet s formula by @xcite given in equation ( [ biressaf , lin ] ) : @xmath189    the @xmath190 plots given in figure [ total - deflection ] confirm that the exact behaviour ( solid red curve ) is best reproduced by our formula ( green curve ) , followed by the formula of beloborodov ( dotted black ) .",
    "note that we only include there results given by the best of the approximations .",
    "in particular , we omit those provided by linearizations in @xmath0 as well as by the quadratic formula .",
    "we can supplement the figure by the @xmath65 limits of the expansions given in section [ expansions ] , to obtain , up to second order in @xmath0 , @xmath191 the linear terms are equal , except that of the wegg s pseudo - newtonian formula ; and the quadratic - term coefficient of the exact value , @xmath192 , is most closely reproduced by beloborodov ( @xmath193 ) and by our formula ( @xmath194 if choosing @xmath155 as in the figures ) .",
    "let us add that it is not difficult to bring yet a better proposal _",
    "solely for the asymptotic angle _ : in figure [ total - deflection ] , look at the dotted gold curve that follows with a slight modification of our asymptotics , @xmath195.\\ ] ] it mirrors the correct curve very accurately down to some @xmath196 where it reaches @xmath197 , namely the photon makes a @xmath198 angular revolution when starting from there .",
    "we stress that this has been just an ad hoc example ; without doubt , still more accurate asymptotic formulas can be found .",
    "we have assumed that the azimuthal angle @xmath28 is adjusted so that @xmath72 , but in a real lensing situation one can only suppose to know positions of the source , of the lensing body and of the observer .",
    "placing the coordinate origin at the lensing body and choosing the azimuthal (  equatorial \" ) plane as that defined by the connecting ray , this means knowing the radii of the source and of the observer , plus the angular _ difference _ between the source and the observer , @xmath199 say .",
    "one a priori does not know the angular position of the ray pericentre , so can_not _ fix the azimuth @xmath28 absolutely prior to solving our inversion exercise @xmath200 .",
    "consider now whether the exercise is still solvable , i.e. whether it is possible to find @xmath26 from this accessible information .    in order for the pericentre @xmath26 to have proper sense ,",
    "let us assume that it lies between the source and the observer . as we wish to _ eventually _ ( in solving the problem ) adjust the azimuth @xmath28 so that @xmath72 , we can assume ( for example ) that the source is at @xmath201 and the observer is at @xmath202 .",
    "let us thus denote their positions by @xmath203 and @xmath204 , respectively .",
    "imagine solving the inversion for @xmath26  from both sides \" , i.e. looking for @xmath205 and @xmath206 ( regarding that @xmath207 whereas @xmath208 , it is better to write the angular data in terms of the cosine which is independent of the sign ; the exercise can then be treated using the same formulas  from both sides \" of the @xmath18 plane ) .",
    "both must lead to the same pericentre @xmath26 , and we also know that @xmath209 gives the total angular distance travelled , @xmath199 ( supposed to be @xmath210 ) , so we have two constraints @xmath211 since @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath199 are known , we have two equations for two unknowns , @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "let us check whether one can really solve the exercise in such a way .",
    "suppose that we employ our approximation according to which @xmath26 is given in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath73 by equation ( [ our - approximation , r0 ] ) .",
    "the constraints thus yield @xmath216 where @xmath217 with @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 introduced below equation ( [ our - approximation , r0 ] ) .",
    "the above equation is to be solved for @xmath214 which in turn implies @xmath221 and @xmath26 , all as functions of @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath199 .    as an illustration ( figure [ exercise ] ) ,",
    "let us choose @xmath222 ( without loss of generality ) and monitor how the solution of the exercise changes with @xmath199 increasing from zero to @xmath223 for a series of source radii @xmath212 increasing from some small value to @xmath213 .",
    "a simple chart with the source lying somewhere on the @xmath224 , @xmath225 half - circle , the observer lying on the @xmath226 , @xmath227 half - circle , and their angular separation @xmath199 gradually growing , reveals that i ) when @xmath212 and @xmath213 are sufficiently different , the solution does not exist for too - small @xmath199 ( the connecting ray is nowhere purely tangential to the centre then ) ; ii ) the solution only starts to exist when @xmath199 is large enough for @xmath212 to just coincide with @xmath26 ; iii ) within the interval of @xmath199 where the solution does exist ,",
    "the pericentre @xmath26 typically decreases from @xmath212 with increasing @xmath199 , because increasing the angular separation corresponds to a connecting ray increasingly bent around the centre ; iv ) for @xmath228 the pericentre radius falls almost to @xmath47 and the approximations more or less cease to provide reasonable answers ; specifically , we learned at the end of section [ new - suggestion ] that according to our approximation the minimal possible pericentre of an unbound trajectory lies at @xmath229 .",
    "the above estimates are confirmed by figure [ exercise ] where the pericentre radii are plotted , in dependence on @xmath199 , for @xmath230 and @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 ,  , @xmath234 .",
    "besides the curves @xmath235 obtained from our approximation ( green curves ) , the figure also shows analogous results obtained , purely numerically , from the _ exact _ formula ( red curves , drawn  under \" the green ones ) .",
    "clearly the two series of curves almost coincide , even at quite small @xmath26 ; our approximation is only not usable for very large @xmath199 ( approaching @xmath223 ) , because this corresponds to very large bending ( by @xmath236 ) where our formula goes over to the elliptic - type bound - orbit regime .",
    "we have suggested a new formula approximating light rays in the schwarzschild space , compared it with other formulas from the literature and showed that it performs very well , though being quite simple and easily invertible for the pericentre radius @xmath26 . besides analytical estimates",
    ", the main focus has been in numerical testing of various plausible approximations against exact results in a very strong as well as a weaker - field regime .",
    "we have shown that our formula also yields very good results for the asymptotic angle of photons , as well as in searching for a connecting ray in a given source  gravitating body  observer configuration .    on a more general level",
    ", we can conclude that in spite of the legitimate vigilance toward ad hoc prescriptions , not following from an exact result by any sound procedure , in our comparison such formulas proved considerably better than low - order expansions of the exact formula , some of them providing acceptable results even in close vicinity to the horizon .",
