    "horizontal gauge symmetry was proposed as an extension of the sm gauge symmetries to unify all families of quarks and leptons @xcite .",
    "given the three families of quarks and leptons , @xmath3 is the most natural choice for the horizontal gauge symmetry . interestingly ,",
    "if one assumes all the sm fermions transform under @xmath13 of @xmath1 , the anomaly free condition requires three generations of right - handed neutrinos @xmath14 @xcite while the right - handed neutrinos also play important roles in explaining the origin of neutrino masses .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 horizontal gauge symmetry model provides a natural scheme for the seesaw mechanism @xcite generating small masses for light neutrinos @xcite . the majorana neutrino mass term for the right - handed neutrinos explicitly breaks the @xmath1 ,",
    "thus it is often believed that the horizontal gauge symmetry should be broken at a very high - energy scale @xmath15 gev .",
    "then it seems impossible to test the @xmath1 gauge interactions in low - energy experiments .",
    "however , it is not always the case as we will show in detail below .",
    "even if some subgroup of the @xmath1 remains unbroken , the right - handed neutrinos can still acquire large majorana masses .",
    "since @xmath16 transform as @xmath17 under @xmath1 , the majorana neutrino mass term can arise from the vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) of an @xmath1 sextet @xmath18 , _",
    "6_ij n_r^j , and @xmath19 .",
    "the light neutrino mass is given by the seesaw mechanism as @xmath20 . in order to explain the the neutrino oscillation data , suitable @xmath21 and @xmath22 are required . for @xmath22 and the other sm fermion masses",
    ", there must exist octet higgs under @xmath1 in order to accommodate the correct mass hierarchy in quarks and leptons .",
    "in addition , to minimize flavor changing effects induced by the octet higgses , we employ a scenario with additional higgses and singlet fermions @xcite in which the @xmath22 and quark mass matrices or lepton mass matrix are all independent . by taking a suitable gauge choice of horizontal symmetry",
    ", we always choose the @xmath23 to be a diagonal matrix , @xmath24 the @xmath21 structure explicitly determines the symmetry breaking .",
    "the @xmath1 is completely broken in a generic vacuum with @xmath25 . however , with a specific vacuum of @xmath26 for instance , the vacuum @xmath21 is invariant under a @xmath27 symmetry and the breaking is @xmath28 .",
    "being symmetric second rank tensor under @xmath1 , the sextet @xmath18 transform as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the generator of the horizontal symmetry .",
    "a general scheme to obtain the unbroken symmetry is derived from the condition that if @xmath32 , @xmath21 is invariant under transformation defined by @xmath33 . to illustrate the feature of our proposal ,",
    "we take a vacuum as @xmath34 .",
    "this vacuum @xmath35 is invariant under the @xmath36 generator @xmath37 as @xmath38 consequently , one can identify the unbroken @xmath0 gauge symmetry with generator @xmath33[multiblock footnote omitted ] and it can survive to low energy , for instance @xmath39(tev ) which may lead to interesting predictions in flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes .",
    "it was also observed that if there exist horizontal gauge interactions , cp violation can be realized with only two generations .",
    "explicit examples of cp violation due to @xmath0 and @xmath40 was discussed in @xcite .",
    "if the above @xmath0 is broken at the low energy , the horizontal gauge boson exchanges can induce additional cp violations @xcite at low energies through quark and lepton mixings .    in the last decades",
    ", huge experimental efforts had been made in improving the measurements on cp violation in the @xmath11 meson system .",
    "very recently , the d@xmath41 collaboration at tevatron has reported a large charge asymmetry in like - sign di - muon @xmath42 in both @xmath43 and @xmath44 decays with 6.1 fb@xmath45 .",
    "a^b_sl = - 9.572.51 1.46 10 ^ -3  , where @xmath46 is the event number for @xmath47 . such a large di - muon charge asymmetry has a 3.2  @xmath48 deviation from the sm prediction @xmath49 @xcite and many models have been proposed to account for this anomaly @xcite .",
    "the cdf has also measured @xmath50 @xcite , using @xmath51 of data , which has a positive value and large uncertainties .",
    "combining the above two results in quadrature ( include the systematic uncertainty ) , we have a_sl^b - 8.5 2.8 10 ^ -3  .    at the tevatron",
    "both @xmath44 and @xmath43 mesons are produced , hence @xmath52 is related to the charge asymmetries @xmath53 in @xmath44 and @xmath43 decays by and @xmath43 meson oscillations . @xmath54",
    "@xcite is measured through the time dependence of @xmath55 and its cp conjugate at d0 and @xmath56  @xcite at the b factory .",
    "nevertheless , we do not use those results here due to their large uncertainty . ]",
    "a_sl^b = ( 0.506 0.043 ) a_sl^d + ( 0.494 0.043 ) a_sl^s  .",
    "new physics ( np ) contributions in @xmath44 mixing are strictly constrained ( we will show it more explicitly in the parameter fit later ) , so only large np contributions to the @xmath43 mixing ( comparing to the other meson mixings ) are allowed . for the np contribution ,",
    "if the mixing in the rotation matrix between mass eigenstate and gauge eigenstate is not huge , then one would naturally expect the @xmath0 that maximizes @xmath4 mixing as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) .",
    "indeed , for a ckm - like rotation matrix , the gauge boson coupling matrix at the tree level in the mass basis goes like g ~ (    ccc ^4 & ^3 & - + ^3 & -^2 & 1 + - & 1 & ^2    )  , where @xmath57 is the wolfenstein parameter @xcite around the order of the cabibbo angle ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "clearly , the meson mixings between the first two generation are highly suppressed .",
    "the np also couples to leptons .",
    "however , their contributions to the @xmath11 meson decay branching ratio to electron and muon are highly suppressed ( although @xmath57 should be replaced by some small mixing of the lepton rotation matrix).[multiblock footnote omitted ] therefore , we focus on the phenomenology in the @xmath11 meson mixing and decay .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we propose the specific model in which we consider in the paper . in section",
    "[ sec : flavor ] we show phenomenological implications of our model on flavor physics which has subsection [ sec : mixing ] related to meson mixing and subsection [ sec : decay ] related to meson decay .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the model starts with a gauged @xmath1 model at extremely high energy . by taking all the fermions as @xmath17 under @xmath1 .",
    "the particle contents under @xmath59 is q_l : ( 3,2 , ) , & u_r : ( 3,1 , ) , & d_r : ( 3,1,- ) + _ l : ( 3,2,-1 ) , & e_r : ( 3,1,-2 ) , & n_r : ( 3,1,0 ) which is exactly vectorial and the @xmath1 is therefore anomaly free symmetry .",
    "it is crucial to have right - handed neutrino triplets , @xmath60 , for anomaly cancellation @xcite .",
    "the extension to the pati - salam unification @xcite may be straightforward .",
    "as we have already discussed the sextet breaking in the introduction , here we focus on the yukawa interactions for the other sm fermions and the dirac neutrino mass matrix . in conventional @xmath1 models , in order to break the @xmath1 as well as",
    "the @xmath61 , one usually introduces one @xmath62 , four @xmath63 to generate all the sm fermion mass hierarchies . horizontal gauge symmetry broken at one boundary brane where all fermion masses are generated at that brane . in this case",
    ", one do not need color octet higgses to generate sm fermion hierarchies .",
    "@xcite as an example .",
    "] however , the @xmath64 higgs will induce large fcnc @xcite if the higgs is light . to avoid the too large fcnc problem ,",
    "another proposal is to introduce @xmath65 higgs@xcite . ^i_8 : ( 8,1,0 ) , h : ( 1,2,1 )  ( i = u , d , e , ) in addition , to generate effective yukawa couplings , a new set of @xmath66 singlet fermions is introduced @xmath67 these singlet fermions form invariant dirac masses and act as messengers to generate the necessary yukawa interactions .",
    "we take the up - type quark mass matrix as an example .",
    "since the octet higgs is no longer @xmath66 doublet , @xmath68 is forbidden and the up - quark yukawa interactions only arise as u_l_8^(u)|u_r+m^u |u_lu_r+q_l |u_r h+ _ u q_l |u_r h where @xmath69 is universal . after integrating out the heavy fermion fields @xmath70 , @xmath71 , the effective up - quark yukawa coupling reduce to |u_r^i ( _ u _ ij + ( _ 8^(u ) m_u^-1)_ij)q_l^j h. [ yuka ] the same mechanism also applies to the mass generation of down type quarks , charged leptons as well as dirac neutrinos . by assigning the @xmath72 independently , the mixings and masses in different fermion sectors are completely independent for each other and one can easily accommodate hierarchies and mixings in sm fermions and the dirac neutrinos .",
    "this also enables us to choose the dirac neutrino mass matrix other than nearly - diagonal structure .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the effective yukawa coupling of @xmath73 also arises as h^-1 |u_r_8^(u ) u_l  .",
    "then , the @xmath74 exchanges induce fcnc s in general .",
    "we have checked that they satisfy the strongest constraint from k - k mixing , marginally .",
    "tev , the effective coupling here is @xmath75 of @xmath76 . with additional propagator suppression due to @xmath77 ,",
    "the amplitude is @xmath78 .",
    "] however , actual effects depends on the mass spectrum of the @xmath74 and hence we do not discuss them in this paper .",
    "another consequence is that both up and down quark mass matrices become hermitian m^_u = m_u , m^_d = m_d thus , the cp violation in strong interactions due to quark mass matrices , @xmath79 is absent at least at the tree level@xcite .",
    "in addition , the hermit mass matrices also require the rotations @xmath80 in the mass diagonalization @xmath81 to be equal @xmath82 . in this case , the horizontal gauge boson couples to vector currents of quarks and leptons . as a consequence , pseudo - scalar bosons like @xmath9 or",
    "@xmath10 do not decay to a pair of leptons .",
    "however , this is only the result of our specific choice of mass generation model for quarks and leptons . in the following analyses , we assume more generic rotation matrices and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are taken independent for each other to estimate the prediction .",
    "the horizontal gauge interaction is real but family dependent . after the mass diagonalization",
    ", the other flavor violation entries as well as new cp violation can arise .",

    ", we will assume that all magnitudes of the left - handed mixings are ckm - like but the complex phases are @xmath91(1 ) and unconstrained right - handed mixings have the similar structure .",

    "mixing magnitude in @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath92 is at the order of @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath94 mixing is also at the order of @xmath95 suppression comparing with @xmath9 mixing .",
