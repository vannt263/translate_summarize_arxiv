    "it holds clearly for @xmath430 , and assuming that it is true for a common prefix @xmath55 we now show that it holds also for @xmath437 and @xmath438 .",
    "* case @xmath437 * : consider the vertex @xmath439 ; by the induction hypothesis , it has an incoming edge on its right , and because @xmath440 the fixed vertical edge under @xmath441 is incoming . by repeated applications of lemma  [ lem : degierplus ]",
    ", we get that :        * case @xmath438*:the starting vertex here is @xmath444 . because @xmath445 , there is a fixed right oriented edge from this point by lemma  [ lem : degierplus ] , and repeated applications of the lemma entail other right oriented edges from @xmath446 for @xmath447 , which extends the zigzag paths and proves point @xmath273 since point @xmath112 is immediate this time , the induction is complete and the lemma is proved .            in order to complete the proof of theorem  [ th : commonps ] , we can not simply invoke the two sub - cases of common prefix and common suffix .",
    "we need to _ merge _ the two cases , and observe what happens when one does the union of all fixed edges .",
    "so we assume we have a common prefix @xmath55 and common suffix @xmath397 .",
    "lemma  [ lem : commons ] give us fixed edges which we can draw drawn in the triangle ; in particular the edges on the right boundary force @xmath83 to begin with @xmath448 zeros and end with @xmath449 ones .",
    "lemma  [ lem : commonp ] also gives fixed edges , but we only consider those below the line @xmath450 , since this will simplify the proof .",
    "these fixed edges are represented by the black , non dotted edges in figure  [ fig : commonps_final ] .",
    "now consider what happens when the edges from points @xmath273 and @xmath112 of lemma  [ lem : commonp ] meet the line @xmath450 and the fixed edges given by lemma  [ lem : commons ] : they force extra edges in the region , represented as red , dotted edges on figure  [ fig : commonps_final ] .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath32 between @xmath451 and @xmath452 ,    * there are @xmath453 extra fixed oriented edges from @xmath303 to @xmath306 added in the northwest of these lines ; in particular , these force @xmath453 supplementary zeros in the prefix of @xmath83 .",
    "* there s are @xmath454 extra fixed oriented edges from @xmath303 to @xmath306 added in the southeast of these lines ; in particular , these force @xmath58 supplementary ones in the suffix of @xmath83 .            * proof of  theorem  [ th : rotatedpart ] : * we have still the factorizations @xmath357 and @xmath358 , but in addition we suppose that @xmath457 .",
    "this means that the external edges corresponding to @xmath458 correspond to different loops , and here we appeal to the lemma of de gier  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 39 ) which gives new fixed edges is not sufficient here , because we do not have any information about the orientation of the edges . ] .",
    "now one notices that all vertices of the triangle are adjacent to at least one fixed edge . in this case",
    ", we can also use an idea of de gier  @xcite : consider all vertices in the triangle which have exactly one incident edge ; to form a tfpl configuration , one must find a matching between such vertices .",
    "dually , we draw a polygon around each such vertex , and let two polygons be adjacent if the corresponding vertices can be matched . the result in our case",
    "is shown on figure  [ fig : rotatedpart_tiling ] , and note that here each polygon can be chosen to be a triangle , and that the result can be in fact embedded in the triangular lattice , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : rotatedtiling2 ] .",
    "now the number @xmath12 , which counts tfpl matchings , is equal to the number of rhombus tilings of the region with some dents induced by @xmath13 and @xmath83 , or more precisely by their factors @xmath208 and @xmath209 ; indeed we just showed that each tfpl configuration will give rise to a certain tiling , and it is easily verified that each tiling of the region will correspond in return to a valid tfpl configuration .",
    "rhombus tilings in such regions are equivalent to counting families of non intersecting lattice paths , the number of which can be written as a determinant thanks to the lindstrm - gessel - viennot ( lgv ) method ; see @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the possible starting points of the paths are @xmath459 and the possible ending points are @xmath460 , where @xmath461 .",
    "now the starting points @xmath463 are those for which @xmath467 , while the ending points are @xmath468 where @xmath469 .",
    "the lgv lemma then tells us that @xmath12 is equal to the determinant @xmath470 where @xmath471 , which is precisely the first determinant in the statement of theorem  [ th : rotatedpart ] . for the second determinant",
    ", this corresponds to encoding the bijection between tilings and non intersecting lattice paths differently : instead of placing points on edges of the triangular lattice oriented southwest to northeast , we choose those that are oriented southeast to northwest .",
    "the rest of the demonstration then goes as before , and this achieves the proof of theorem  [ th : rotatedpart ] ."
