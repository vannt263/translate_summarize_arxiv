    "light is known as fastest carrier of energy and information and this property makes light indispensable for communications , warfare and fundamental research . while light can be relatively easy created and guided , its manipulation is somewhat difficult .",
    "manipulation of the light requires dynamical control of the refractive index of the host medium . while the materials for active control of the light are still under development , the theoretical studies are already started .",
    "recently , the light manipulation was investigated in work @xcite where the weak scattering by the finite object was studied by using the first born approximation . in practice , the light scattering by photonic cluster may be not weak and it should be studied with other methods . the local perturbation method ( lpm ) is suitable tool for such analysis .",
    "the lpm correctly describes scattering by particles with arbitrary large refractive index which are small compared to the incident wavelength and the scattering can be strong ( see for example work @xcite-@xcite and references wherein ) . in works",
    "@xcite-@xcite the lpm was used to study the wave propagation in the photonic cluster .    in this paper",
    "we optimize the light scattering from the cluster made of small particles by using the lpm and special optimization technic . by using our method we modify the cluster in such a way that the scattering from the cluster is significantly minimized or maximized at one point .",
    "we present several examples which will show that the scattering by the cluster can be increased and decreased by several orders of magnitude for selected wavelength and direction .",
    "the formalism we use is presented in many works ( see for example @xcite-@xcite ) and we only briefly present it here for convenience and consistency . consider the photonic cluster made of particles which characteristic sizes are small compared to the incident wavelength @xmath0 . the electric field @xmath1  propagating in the host medium filled with @xmath2 particles is described by the following equation @xcite    @xmath3    where    @xmath4    here @xmath5 is laplacian and @xmath6  nabla operators , @xmath7 defines tensor product , @xmath8 is a wave number in the host medium ( @xmath9 is the angular frequency and @xmath10 is the light velocity in vacuum ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the permittivity of the @xmath13-th particle and the medium respectively , @xmath14 is the function describing the shape of the @xmath13-th scatterer , and @xmath15 is the field source .",
    "the characteristic size of @xmath13-th scatterer we denote as @xmath16 .",
    "note , that the equation ( [ inv11 ] ) is an approximate one and this is true only when the small scatterers ( @xmath17 ) are considered .",
    "this equation is easily solvable with respect to the fields @xmath18 when the positions @xmath19 are known ( it will invoke solution of @xmath20 linear equations for each frequency @xmath21 .",
    "the solution of the equation ( [ inv11 ] ) can be written in the following form    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    and    @xmath24    here @xmath25 is the @xmath26 unitary tensor in polarization space and @xmath19 is the radius vector of the n - th particle .",
    "the field @xmath27 is the field inside the @xmath13-th particle , @xmath28 is the fourier transform of the function @xmath14 , and @xmath29 defines scalar product .",
    "the incident field @xmath30 is created by the source @xmath15 in the host medium and it is not important for our consideration .",
    "the formula ( [ inv12 ] ) is rather general one and it describes the field in the medium with photonic cluster of arbitrary form made of small particles of arbitrary form .",
    "the fields @xmath31 should be found by solving the system of @xmath32 linear equations obtained by substituting @xmath33 into eq .",
    "( [ inv12 ] ) .",
    "the formula for the scattered field ( [ inv13 ] ) can be simplified even further when the distance between the observer and an @xmath13-th scatterer ( @xmath34 ) is large , i.e. when @xmath35 . in this case",
    "the integral @xmath36 can be calculated approximately .",
    "we note also that the integral @xmath36 can be calculated exactly at least for the spherical particles .",
    "when @xmath37 integration in ( [ inv13 ] ) gives    @xmath38    where    @xmath39    here @xmath34 is the distance between the observation point and @xmath13-th scatterer , @xmath40 is the volume of the @xmath13-th scatterer , and @xmath41 brackets denote absolute value .    in practice ,",
    "the distance between the cluster and the observer is much more larger than the size of the cluster and the inequality @xmath42 is fulfilled . in this case",
    "the field ( [ inv15 g ] ) can be simplified and rewritten in the form    @xmath43    where    @xmath44",
    "the idea of our approach is the following .",
    "we assume that scatterers in the cluster can be repositioned in a such a way that the field scattered by the cluster will be tuned to required value at the observation point .    at first",
    ", we calculate the intensity of the scattered field from the given ( not modified ) cluster for selected wavelength @xmath45 and observation point @xmath46 . after this",
    "we select one particle in the cluster and reposition it a bit in @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 directions ( usually for tenth of the particle size ) recalculating the scattered field in @xmath46 each time we move the particle . from the array of the calculated intensities we select the value nearest to the required one and we place the particle at the point corresponding to this intensity value .",
    "we perform this procedure for all particles in the cluster and repeat it several times .",
    "after several iterations , the particles in the cluster will be rearranged in such a way that the intensity of the scattered light will correspond the required value at the selected observation point @xmath46  and for the wavelength @xmath50 .     versus @xmath51 for the not optimized @xmath52 cluster .",
    "the particles in the cluster are arranged into cubic lattice .",
    "the permittivity of the host medium is @xmath53 , the characteristic size of the particles is @xmath54 nm , the period of the cluster is @xmath55 , and the total number of the particles is @xmath56 .",
    "the source is positioned at @xmath57  and the observation points @xmath58 are located at the circle with radius @xmath59 .",
    "the angle @xmath60 is the angle between vector @xmath46 and @xmath61 in @xmath62 plane.,width=340 ]    for example , super reflective cluster can be created when the intensity of the scattered field @xmath63 will be maximized at some point and minimized at all other points ( directions ) .",
    "another important example closely related to optical cloaking is the cluster with significantly reduced reflectivity for selected wavelength at chosen direction . when the reflectivity of the cluster is lower than the sensitivity level of the receiver , this cluster is actually invisible for observer .",
    "moreover , when the intensity of the field scattered by the cluster is changed in some direction , this can be used in directional optical switch .",
    "this kind of device can be used for light houses , for example . when the spectrum of the field scattered by the cluster is modified in time when the cluster can be used as a filter .",
    "below we present several examples demonstrating the possibility to optimize the cluster reflectivity in chosen direction for selected wavelength .",
    "we note that similar approach was successfully used in work @xcite where the phase of incident field was tuned to maximize the field scattered from the complex object ( eggshell and tio powder ) in chosen direction .     versus @xmath51 for the optimized spherical cluster made of @xmath52 cubes .",
