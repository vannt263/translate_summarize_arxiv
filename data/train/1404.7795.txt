    "the production of energetic particles during flares remains a central unsolved issue in solar physics .",
    "extensive observational evidence indicates that a substantial fraction of the energy released during a flare rapidly accelerates charged particles , with electrons reaching @xmath1 mev and ions @xmath1 gev / nucleon @xcite . explaining such energy gain requires accounting not only for the relevant energy and time scales but also the resulting spectra , which exhibit a common shape for most ion species . at the same time , high mass - to - charge ions are greatly over - represented in flares , with abundances as much as two orders of magnitude higher than normal coronal values @xcite .",
    "magnetic reconnection is the ultimate energy source in impulsive flares .",
    "thus , in many theories reconnection plays a direct role in particle acceleration through dc electric fields @xcite , interactions with multiple magnetic islands @xcite or first - order fermi acceleration in contracting and merging islands @xcite . on the other hand , in some models reconnection serves as a source of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves @xcite or shocks @xcite",
    "that then independently drive particle acceleration .",
    "the release of magnetic energy during reconnection dominantly takes place downstream of the x - line in the exhaust where newly reconnected field lines expand to relax their magnetic tension and drive alfvnic outflows .",
    "the characteristic outflow speed is given by @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 the reconnecting component of the magnetic field and density just upstream of the exhaust .",
    "in the mhd description the dominant heating during reconnection of anti - parallel magnetic fields is produced by the switch - off petschek shocks that bound the exhaust @xcite .",
    "these shocks also drive the alfvnic outflow . in the kinetic description ,",
    "ions moving across the exhaust are slung by the fast moving field lines .",
    "the resulting counterstreaming ion distributions produce a large effective parallel temperature @xmath5 with minimal perpendicular heating @xcite .",
    "the associated pressure anisotropy prevents the formation of the petschek switch - off shock @xcite .",
    "coronal reconnection , however , typically involves a substantial guide field ( the magnetic field component perpendicular to the plane of reconnection ) . in reconnection with a guide field",
    "the mhd model produces a pair of rotational discontinuities ( rds ) that bound the exhaust and produce the magnetic field rotation that drives the outflow . a pair of parallel shocks within the exhaust compress and heat the ions .",
    "an important question is whether the mhd description is valid in the typical coronal environment where the particle scattering mean - free - path is relatively long . in a kinetic description the rds that bound the exhaust collapse to the scale of the proton sound larmor radius @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the sound speed and @xmath8 is the proton cyclotron frequency @xcite .",
    "if the crossing time of ions ( of any species ) through the rd is longer than their cyclotron time , the ions will cross the rd with little heating and will counterstream across the exhaust to produce an increment in the effective parallel temperature @xcite , @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the ambient guide field reduces the parallel heating compared with the case of anti - parallel reconnection . if the crossing time of ions through the rd is shorter than their cyclotron time , the ions entering into the exhaust are not able to follow the rapid change in the direction of the magnetic field and become non - adiabatic",
    ". they effectively behave like pickup particles since they are initially at rest in the alfvnic flow of the exhaust @xcite . as they are `` picked up '' by the exhaust they gain an effective thermal velocity @xmath11 .",
    "because of the strong guide field the temperature increment is perpendicular to the local magnetic field ( @xmath12 ) and is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 the mass of the relevant ion species  heavier ions gain more energy .",
    "note that for @xmath15 the heating in the pickup regime greatly exceeds that in the non - pickup regime .",
    "the criterion for pickup behavior translates into @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the normalized rate of reconnection , @xmath18 is the ratio of plasma to magnetic pressure based on the reconnection magnetic field just upstream of the exhaust and @xmath19 is the ion charge state .",
    "high mass - to - charge ions satisfy this criterion more easily than protons .",
    "classical collisions are often not negligible in the corona so an important question is whether classical resistive diffusion of the magnetic field is sufficient to broaden the rd beyond the larmor scale @xmath20 .",
    "balancing convection of magnetic flux through the rd with resistive diffusion @xmath21 yields an equation for the limiting width @xmath22 , @xmath23 or @xmath24 for typical solar parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) with @xmath28 we find @xmath29 , much shorter than @xmath30 .",
    "thus , classical collisions are insufficient to broaden the rd beyond @xmath20 and are therefore unimportant .",
    "the collisionless model of the rd should correctly describe the dynamics .",
    "the solar corona is normally considered a low @xmath31 medium and therefore one might expect the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ massthresh ] ) for pickup behavior to be easily satisfied .",
    "however , prior to the onset of reconnection ambient current layers are likely to be macroscopic and for this reason when reconnection first onsets the magnetic field just upstream of the reconnection region @xmath32 will be very small .",
    "@xmath32 will then increase in time as the larger magnetic field upstream convects toward the reconnection site .",
    "thus , at the start of reconnection all ions will be in the adiabatic regime because @xmath33 will be large and energy going into ion heating compared with that associated with the bulk flow will be small .",
    "as @xmath33 drops as reconnection proceeds each ion species will sequentially ( based on their mass - to - charge ) move into the pickup regime .",
    "once protons have entered the pickup regime the fraction of released magnetic energy going into ion heat will be comparable to that in the bulk flow .",
    "consistent with this picture , observations have revealed that in the extended solar corona , @xmath34 @xcite , suggesting that magnetic reconnection is a potential heating mechanism for the large - scale corona .",
    "earlier there was an assumption that the observations of @xmath35 in the corona argued in favor of ion heating by ion cyclotron waves @xcite .",
    "this assumption needs to be re - examined .",
    "further , if the pickup scenario for ion heating during reconnection is correct , the lower threshold for strong ion heating for high mass - to - charge ions might be a mechanism for the abundance enhancement of such ions in impulsive flares @xcite as an alternative to proposed wave mechanisms @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we explore the onset of pickup behavior and associated strong ion heating during reconnection using a particle - in - cell ( pic ) code with an initial state with a wide current layer and a strong ambient guide field .",
    "we include two ion species , protons and @xmath0 particles , so that we can separate the onset of ion heating based on mass - to - charge .",
    "early in the simulation the heating of both species is weak .",
    "as reconnection develops , the upstream value of @xmath33 decreases and the @xmath0s undergo a sharp transition to strong perpendicular heating .",
    "the threshold for this transition is close to that given in eq .",
    "( [ massthresh ] ) .",
    "the protons in contrast remain below the threshold for pickup behavior and do not exhibit the onset of strong perpendicular heating . because the exhaust velocity of the simulation varies over a substantial range ( as @xmath32 increases monotonically ) , the scaling of parallel and perpendicular heating with the exhaust outflow velocity is obtained and compared with the predictions in eqs .",
    "( [ tpar ] ) and ( [ tperp ] ) .",
    "the simulations therefore establish the fundamental properties of ion heating during reconnection with a guide field and lay the groundwork for understanding ion heating in the extended corona and during impulsive flares and in other astrophysical and laboratory systems .",
    "we carry out simulations using the code p3d @xcite .",
    "like all pic codes , it tracks individual particles ( @xmath36 in this work ) as they move through electromagnetic fields defined on a mesh .",
    "unlike more traditional fluid representations ( e.g. , mhd ) , pic codes correctly treat small lengthscales and fast timescales , which are particularly important for understanding the x - line and separatrices during magnetic reconnection .",
    "the simulated system is periodic in the @xmath37 plane , where flow into and away from the x - line are parallel to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , and the guide magnetic field and reconnection electric field are parallel to @xmath40 .",
    "the initial magnetic field and density profiles are based on the harris equilibrium .",
    "the reconnecting magnetic field is given by @xmath41- \\tanh[(y-3l_y/4)/w_0]-1 $ ] , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the half - width of the current sheets and the box size in the @xmath38 direction .",
    "particles are distributed in a constant - density background and two current sheets in which the density rises in order to maintain pressure balance with the magnetic field .",
    "we initiate reconnection with a small perturbation that produces a single magnetic island on each current layer .",
    "the code is written in normalized units in which magnetic fields are scaled to the asymptotic value of the reversed field @xmath44 , densities to the value at the center of the initial current sheets minus the uniform background density , velocities to the proton alfvn speed @xmath45 , times to the inverse proton cyclotron frequency in @xmath44 , @xmath46 , lengths to the proton inertial length @xmath47 and temperatures to @xmath48 .    the proton - to - electron mass ratio is taken to be @xmath49 in order to minimize the difference between pertinent length scales and hence simulate as large a domain as possible .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the rate of reconnection and structure of the outflow exhaust do not depend on this ratio .",
    "since the ion heating examined here depends only on the exhaust geometry , we also expect our results to be insensitive to the mass ratio .",
    "the simulation assumes @xmath50 , i.e. that field and particle quantities do not vary in the out - of - plane direction , making this a two - dimensional simulation .",
    "in addition to protons and electrons , we also include a number density of @xmath51 @xmath52he@xmath53 ( @xmath0 ) particles in the background particle population with an initial temperature equal to that of the electrons and protons",
    ". this number density does not affect the reconnection dynamics appreciably , while still providing a large sample of particles with @xmath54 that can be used to test the scaling of the onset relation for pickup behavior given in eq .",

    "( [ massthresh ] ) ) . for typical coronal parameters of @xmath100 g and @xmath101 , energy increments of @xmath102 kev / nucleon are expected .",
    "the temperature increment is dominantly perpendicular to the local magnetic field and the released magnetic energy going into heating ions in this regime is comparable to that associated with the bulk flow .",
    "ions in the adiabatic regime are only weakly heated , heating is parallel to the magnetic field and in this regime the energy going into heating ions is much smaller than the energy going into bulk flow .",
    "observations have revealed that the abundances of high mass - to - charge ions ions are enhanced in solar flares , with the strength of the enhancement depending only on @xmath103 .",
    "the fact that non - adiabatic behavior and the associated strong heating depends on @xmath103 suggests that reconnection might be able to explain the abundance enhancements in impulsive flares .",
    "furthermore , the increase in @xmath104 in the exhaust seen here is consistent with that observed in the extended corona @xcite .",
    "strong perpendicular heating of high mass - to - charge ions is also seen in laboratory reversed field pinch experiments during global sawtooth events @xcite .    the kinetic energy of ions picked up during reconnection in the solar corona of @xmath102 kev / nucleon , although significantly above thermal energies , falls short of the inferred maximal energies of @xmath105 gev .",
    "further acceleration can occur via interactions with the multiple magnetic islands predicted to be produced during flares @xcite .",
    "super - alfvnic ions trapped within a slowly contracting island can repeatedly reflect from the ends , gaining energy via a first - order fermi process , and producing power - law spectra consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "thermal ions can not be accelerated by this process because their bounce time is greater than the timescale for island contraction .",
    "thus , the pickup process can act as a seed mechanism for further energy gain and may ultimately control the abundances of ions measured in impulsive flares .",
    "a realistic test of this scenario requires 3-d simulations of multiple x - lines and multiple islands , something which is not currently computationally feasible .",
    "simulations of multiple current layers in a 2-d model , however , will enable us to explore both the pickup process and subsequent heating through island merging and contraction .",
    "observations of reconnection at the magnetopause as , for example , carried out for electrons @xcite should yield data for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for both protons and @xmath0 particles in order to test the mechanism discussed here . provided the instrumentation can differentiate between different @xmath103 ions , data collected by the upcoming solar probe plus mission , with a planned perihelion of @xmath108 ( which lies within the outer corona ) , should also be able put our predictions to the test .",
    "finally , it is widely believed that some process converts a fraction of the energy found in the convective motions of the solar photosphere into the heat that ensures the continuous existence of a @xmath109 corona and accelerates the solar wind .",
    "broadly speaking , the two most likely candidates are wave heating  in which oscillations generated in the photosphere travel into the corona , develop into turbulence , and dissipate  and reconnection , in which the topological reorganization of the magnetic field releases energy and heats the plasma .",
