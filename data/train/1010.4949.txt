    "among close - binary systems in which magnetic fields exert a substantial influence on the flow of matter in the system , the most prominent are polars and intermediate polars @xcite .",
    "these are semi - detached binary systems consisting of a low - mass , late - type star ( the donor ) and a white dwarf ( the accretor ) . during the process of mass transfer",
    ", matter flows from the donor onto the white dwarf through the inner lagrange point .    in polars ( am her - type systems )",
    ", the white dwarf has a strong intrinsic magnetic field ( @xmath2  g at the surface ) .",
    "these systems are characterized by relatively short orbital periods ( 1 - 5 hr),and the rotation of the components is synchronized @xcite .",
    "analysis of observational data shows that accretion disks do not form in polars ; instead , the matter flowing from the donor forms a collimated flow , which falls onto a region around one of the magnetic poles of the accretor along the star s magnetic - field lines @xcite .    the white dwarfs in intermediate polars possess relatively weak magnetic fields ( @xmath3  g at the surface ) .",
    "these systems occupy an intermediate position between polars and non - magnetic cataclysmic variables .",
    "the rotational periods of the accretors in these systems are appreciably shorter than the orbital periods , by factors of one , two , or even three orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the asynchronicity of the rotation of the accretor in intermediate polars can be explained as an effect of the interaction of the magnetic field of the white dwarf with the disk material near the boundary of the magnetosphere . as a result of this interaction , an equilibrium rotational regime",
    "is established in which the corotation radius is equal to the magnetosphere radius @xcite .",
    "our previous studies @xcite have used three - dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the flow structures in close - binary systems ( using ss cyg as an example ) , allowing for relatively weak , dipolar accretor magnetic fields ( @xmath4  g at the surface ) . modeling with high values of @xmath5 is more difficult due to the fact that increasing the field strength leads to rigid constraints on the time step required for the difference scheme to be stable ( the courant - friedrichs - levy condition ) .",
    "however , a simple analysis shows that this problem has a fundamental , rather than technical , nature .",
    "indeed , the alfvn velocity , estimated by the expression @xmath6 can exceed the speed of light @xmath7 in the accretion flows of polars .",
    "therefore , in general , it is not correct to use a non - relativistic magnetic gas - dynamical approximation when modeling the structure of such a flow .",
    "however , it does not really make sense to apply relativistic magnetic gas - dynamics in this case , since the plasma flow itself is appreciably non - relativistic .",
    "only alfvn and magneto - acoustic waves in the accretion flow will propagate with relativistic speeds . over the characteristic dynamical time for the evolution of the slow plasma flow ,",
    "the mhd waves are able to pass through the accretion flow many times ( in the longitudinal and transverse directions ) . as a result , the dynamics of the plasma flow can be treated in a modified , non - relativistic , magnetic , gas - dynamical framework , as a mean flow that forms the backdrop for wave mhd turbulence .",
    "we propose here a numerical model for computing the flow structures in close - binary systems with strong accretor magnetic fields .",
    "we present results of our numerical simulations obtained using a modified , three - dimensional , parallel code .",
    "these computations were carried out for magnetic fields at the accretor surface from @xmath0 to @xmath1  g.    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the main equations and numerical method used in the framework of the modified model .",
    "section 3 presents a comparison of the flow structures in a semi - detached system similar to ss cyg for various white - dwarf magnetic fields , based on the three - dimensional numerical simulation results .",
    "the conclusion briefly discusses the main results of our study .",
    "we will use a non - inertial reference frame that rotates together with the binary system with the angular velocity @xmath8 relative to its center of mass .",
    "we will use the cartesian coordinates ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) in this frame , with the coordinate origin coincident with the center of the accretor and the center of the donor located a distance @xmath12 from the accretor along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the @xmath11 axis is directed along the rotational axis of the system .",
    "let us consider a semi - detached binary system whose accretor rotates synchronously , so that the rotational period of the accretor is equal to the orbital period of the system .",
    "we will take the magnetic field of the accretor to be dipolar , so that the vector magnetic field is given by @xmath13 in general , the direction of the magnetic moment @xmath14 may not coincide with the direction of the angular velocity of the binary system @xmath8 . in our chosen coordinate system , the vector @xmath14 has the components @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the modulus of @xmath14 , @xmath19 is the inclination of @xmath14 to the @xmath11 axis , and @xmath20 is the angle between the @xmath9 axis and the projection of @xmath14 onto the @xmath21 plane . note that a magnetic field of the form is potential @xmath22 and , in the case of synchronous rotation , stationary @xmath23",
    ".    the magnetic field of the accretor can be fairly strong in the region of the magnetosphere .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to represent the total magnetic field in the plasma @xmath24 as the sum of the accretor magnetic field @xmath25 and the magnetic field induced by currents in the plasma itself @xmath26 : @xmath27 . using the properties of the field @xmath25 noted above ,",
    "it can partially be eliminated from the magnetic gas - dynamical equations @xcite .",
    "we described plasma flows arising due to mass transfer in the close - binary system , taking into account the strong magnetic field of the compact object @xmath25 , using the system of equations",

    "the effects of radiative heating and cooling are included in the entropy equation , as well as heating of matter due to current dissipation ( the last term ) .",
    "the radiative heating and cooling functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 have complex dependences on the temperature @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "our numerical model uses a linear approximation for these functions in the vicinity of the equilibrium temperature , @xmath44 @xcite , corresponding to an effective temperature of the accretor of 37000  k. the term @xmath45 in the equation of motion describes the coriolis force .",
    "the density , entropy , and pressure are related by the equation of state of an ideal gas : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the specific heat of the gas at constant volume and @xmath48 is the adiabatic index .",
    "the numerical model includes the effects of magnetic - field diffusion [ see ] .",
    "the earlier analysis of @xcite showed that two effects dominate in accretion disks forming in close - binary systems @xcite .",
    "the first is magnetic reconnection and current dissipation in turbulent vortices .",
    "the second is buoyancy of force tubes of the toroidal magnetic field generated in the disk due to its differential rotation .",
    "accretion disks may not be able to form in systems with strong magnetic fields , in which case the flow will have the form of an accretion - column stream directed from the inner lagrange point @xmath49 toward one of the magnetic poles of the accretor ( a polar ) . in this case",
    ", the main effect leading to current dissipation in the plasma is probably wave mhd turbulence due to the propagation of alfvn and magneto - acoustic waves in the accretion - column stream .",
    "the velocity of these waves will far exceed the velocity of the plasma itself and , in some cases , may even be relativistic . the wave magnetic viscosity ( see appendix b ) @xmath50 can be obtained from the expression @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the characteristic scale for wave pulsations , which can be estimated as the scale for inhomogeneities of the accretor magnetic field : @xmath53 .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 determines the efficiency of wave diffusion .",
    "the total magnetic viscosity @xmath38 due to all effects depends on the magnetic field in the plasma .",
    "therefore , on the whole , the diffusion of the magnetic field has a non - linear character .",
    "the last term in the equation of motion describes the force exerted on the plasma by the accretor magnetic field , which influences the component of the plasma velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field lines @xmath55 .",
    "the basis for this term is provided in appendix a. note that the motion of plasma particles across the magnetic field is due primarily to the gravitational force of the compact object ( gravitational drift ) ( see , for example , @xcite ) . due to the larmor character of the motion of particles in the magnetic field , their mean motion is decelerated in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the strong external magnetic field plays the role of an effective fluid with which the plasma interacts .",
    "the last term in can be interpreted as a frictional force between the plasma and magnetic field , whose form is analogous to the friction between the components in a plasma consisting of several types of particles @xcite .",
    "recall that our model assumes synchronous rotation of the accretor . in this case , the velocity of the magnetic field lines in our chosen system is zero .",
    "the characteristic time for decay of the perpendicular velocity is @xmath56 this quantity is determined by wave dissipation of the magnetic field , which is characterized by the diffusion coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "a similar expression for the electro - magnetic force due to the strong magnetic field of an accretor was used in @xcite , where the flow structure was modeled using a quasi - particle method .",
    "the quasi - particles were taken to be individual blobs of plasma that fall into the roche lobe of the accretor through the inner lagrange point @xmath49 . in these studies , an expression for the decelerating force of the form @xmath57 was justified by the fact that diamagnetic effects arise in the plasma blobs during their motion in the external magnetic field @xcite , which hinder their free motion perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "suppose we know the distribution of all quantities in the computational region at time @xmath58 .",
    "to obtain their values at the next time step , corresponding to time @xmath59 , we split the equations  according to the various physical processes they represent .",
    "the full algorithm consists of five successive steps , which we describe briefly below .    in the first step ,",
    "a subsystem of equations describing the dynamics of the plasma in its own magnetic field is distinguished : @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 the form of this system coincides with the equations of ideal magnetic gas dynamics @xcite .",
    "the system can be solved numerically using the higher - order gudonov - type difference scheme described in @xcite ( if @xmath64 in all expressions there ) .",
    "when constructing the difference scheme , we applied the technique of unified variables for mhd equations @xcite , which enabled us to use an adaptive mesh in the numerical code .",
    "the computations presented below used a geometrically adaptive mesh that became more dense toward the equatorial plane and the surface of the accretor .",
    "this made it possible to appreciably enhance the spatial resolution of the vertical structure of the accretion disk and in the region of the accretor magnetosphere .",
    "we used the eight - wave method to clean the divergence of the plasma magnetic field @xmath26 @xcite . note that the external magnetic field @xmath25 does not appear in this system of equations",
    "therefore , the limitations on the time step @xmath65 imposed by the stability condition for the difference scheme ( the courant - friedrichs - levy condition ) will not be excessively severe .    in the second step ,",
    "we take into account variations of the gas velocity due to external forces ( the coriolis force and gradient of the roche potential ) : @xmath66 all remaining quantities are taken to be constant in this step of the algorithm .",
    "since the roche potential is time - independent , the solution of this equation in the interval @xmath67 can be written @xmath68 the integration constants in these equations @xmath12 and @xmath69 are determined from the initial conditions : @xmath70 the initial velocities @xmath71 are equal to the values obtained at time @xmath72 in the previous step of the algorithm from the solution of .    the third step of the algorithm takes into account deceleration during motion of the plasma across magnetic field lines , as well as the generation of magnetic field due to this motion .",
    "the corresponding equations can be written @xmath73 integration of these equations yields @xmath74    in the fourth step , we take into account the effects of magnetic - field diffusion . recall that the equation describing diffusion of the magnetic field is non - linear in our model .",
    "therefore , the application of explicit methods to solve this equation would lead to excessively severe limitations on the time step . in our approach , this equation was solved numerically using an implicit , locally one - dimensional method with a factorizable operator @xcite .",
    "we applied regularization of the factorizable operator to deal with the mixed derivatives that arise due to the use of an adaptive mesh .",
    "the regularization procedure essentially reduces to replacing the multiplicative operators making up the original factorizable operator with equivalent tridiagonal operators .",
    "the regularization parameter is determined by the maximum - modulus eigenvalue of the metric tensor describing the curvilinear coordinate system . to correctly take into account non - linear terms in the scheme , we devised an iterative process that was applied until we obtained a solution with a specified accuracy . in each iteration , a system of linear , algebraic equations with a tridiagonal matrix arises , which is solved numerically using a scalar fitting method .",
    "the method used to solve the magnetic - field diffusion equation is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "finally , the fifth step takes into account the effects of radiative heating and cooling , as well as heating due to current dissipation .",
    "these processes are described by the right - hand side of .",
    "we emphasize that we used semi - analytical or implicit , absolutely stable methods in all other steps of the algorithm ( apart from the first ) . therefore",
    ", no constraints are imposed on the time step @xmath65 apart from the courant - friedrichs - levy stability condition [ which arises during the solution of  ] .",
    "let us consider the formation of an accretion disk in a close - binary system whose parameters correspond to ss cyg as a function of the accretor magnetic field .",
    "the donor of the ss cyg system is a red dwarf with mass @xmath75 and the accretor is a white dwarf with mass @xmath76 .",
    "the orbital period of the system is @xmath77  hr , and its semi - major axis is @xmath78 @xcite . in our computations , the magnetic field at the white - dwarf surface",
    "was varied from @xmath0 to @xmath1 g , and the orientation of the magnetic axis was fixed , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    at the inner lagrange point @xmath49 , we specified the gas velocity to be equal to the local sound speed , @xmath81 , which corresponds to a donor temperature of 4000  k. the gas density at @xmath49 is @xmath82 , and the mass transfer rate is @xmath83 .",
    "we specified the following boundary conditions at the remaining boundaries of the computational domain : density @xmath84 , temperature @xmath85 , velocity @xmath86 , and magnetic field @xmath87 .",

    "the computations for all the models were continued until a quasi - stationary regime was reached , when the total mass of matter in the computational domain was roughly constant ( to within 1% ) . in models in which an accretion disk formed , the time for establishing this quasi - stationary regime was about 10 - 15 orbital periods . in models with strong magnetic fields and without the formation of an accretion disk ,",

    "the northern accretion flow is more powerful in model 4 , and the southern in model 5 .",
    "this comes about because , in our formulation of the problem , the south magnetic pole is closer to @xmath49 than the north magnetic pole .",
    "therefore , the motion of plasma toward the south magnetic pole is energetically more favorable in a stronger magnetic field .",
    "this is supported by our results for model 6 , in which only one accretion flow forms , ending at the south magnetic pole of the star .",
    "the magnetic field in model 7 is so strong that it virtually completely controls the flow inside the accretor roche lobe .",
    "the matter is captured by the magnetic field essentially immediately behind the lagrange point , and is directed along the magnetic lines toward the stellar surface , forming a powerful southern stream and weaker northern stream .",
    "figure [ fg1 ] shows that , in this case , the magnetosphere becomes larger than the accretor roche lobe , and therefore partially encompasses the donor envelope .",
    "this model probably corresponds to so - called _ magnetors _ @xcite , which represent the limiting case of a polar whose white dwarf has a very strong magnetic field .",

    "the flow can circle around the star and eventually intersect itself at some point .",
    "the further evolution of this flow leads to the formation of an accretion disk in the system .",

    "plasma dynamics in a strong external magnetic field are characterized by the relatively slow mean motion of particles along the magnetic lines , their drift across the field lines , and the propagation of alfvn and magneto - acoustic waves with very high speeds against the backdrop of these slow motions . over the characteristic dynamical time",

    "it is necessary to separate out rapidly propagating fluctuations and apply a well defined procedure for averaging over the ensemble of wave pulsations .",

    ", @xmath143 is the electric field in the plasma , @xmath27 the total magnetic field , @xmath144 the current density , and @xmath145 the conductivity .",

    "since , as a rule , @xmath152 , the right - hand side can be neglected .",

    "the second term can be calculated using .",
    "we then have @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the component of the mean plasma velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath25 , and the characteristic relaxation time is @xmath159",
    "the diffusion coefficient for the magnetic field @xmath50 associated with wave mhd turbulence can be estimated using the expression @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the correlation time for pulsations .",
    "this expression can be parametrized as follows : @xmath162 where @xmath54 is a dimensionless parameter that is close to unity and @xmath52 is the characteristic spatial scale for the pulsations , for which we can use the scale for inhomogeneity in the external magnetic field , @xmath163 . since the accretor magnetic field is dipolar in our model , @xmath164 .",
