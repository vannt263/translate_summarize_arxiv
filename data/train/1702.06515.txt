    "the kondo problem  the question of how an impurity local moment becomes screened at low temperatures by the conduction electrons of a host metal  was highly influential in stimulating the development of theoretical and numerical methods for treating strongly correlated condensed matter @xcite .",

    "s scaling , electron states far from the fermi energy are progressively eliminated as the effective bandwidth is reduced with a compensating adjustment of a dimensionless measure of the effective impurity - band exchange coupling .",

    "poor man s scaling was subsequently extended to the anderson model with impurity coulomb interaction @xmath5 @xcite , and the @xmath6-channel kondo model @xcite , where it correctly predicts the existence of a stable rg fixed point at an intermediate value of the exchange coupling that lies within the perturbative domain for @xmath7 .",

    "this paper addresses the question of how well poor man s scaling captures the phase boundaries in quantum impurity problems that feature both ( i ) more than one independent coupling that flows under the reduction of the effective bandwidth , and ( ii ) unstable critical points arising from competing flows in the multi - dimensional parameter space of effective couplings . to this end",

    "the phase boundary ( thick lines ) separating the ferromagnetic and strong - coupling phase is given by the condition @xmath526 , which is consistent with nrg studies of the model .",
    "in this work , we have extended the poor man s scaling method to analyze phase boundaries in variants of the anderson and kondo impurity models that feature a power - law vanishing or divergence of the host density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "the predicted locations of the phase boundaries are generally in excellent qualitative and good quantitative agreement with those obtained using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , which remains the most reliable technique for treating power - law quantum impurity problems .",
    "the scaling approach has the advantages that it is much more intuitive than the nrg and it can clarify algebraically the functional dependence of the critical impurity - host coupling on other model parameters .",
