    "one of the prime objectives of experiments at hadron supercolliders is the discovery of the higgs boson and the subsequent investigation of its properties .",
    "if the higgs boson is relatively heavy or if electroweak symmetry breaking is driven by some new strong interactions , then the study of higgs boson production in the weak boson fusion process or of longitudinal weak boson scattering becomes particularly important .",
    "the study of the `` gold - plated '' @xmath4 higgs boson decay mode alone will clearly not suffice to completely understand the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking or may not yield a significant signal  @xcite . because of severe background problems one needs to utilize as much information as possible about the full structure of the underlying @xmath5 process when trying to utilize other channels like @xmath6 or hadronic decays of the produced weak bosons .",
    "this includes forward - jet - tagging  @xcite to suppress processes like @xmath7 , central - jet - vetoing for the reduction of top - quark backgrounds  @xcite , looking for relatively low overall hadronic multiplicities  @xcite or searching for rapidity gap signatures  @xcite to exploit the color singlet exchange between the two initial state quarks as a distinguishing feature of the signal . in all these cases",
    "the knowledge of qcd emission corrections is important or even crucial to assess the acceptance of the various procedures for signal events .    in this paper",
    "we present first results of the calculation of all @xmath1 real emission corrections to the full electroweak process @xmath8 ( and crossing related ones ) with subsequent leptonic @xmath9 decays .",
    "results are obtained by the numerical evaluation of polarization amplitudes  @xcite and were implemented for @xmath0 and @xmath10 collisions .",
    "an outline of the calculation is given in section ii , details are relegated to an appendix .",
    "in two subsequent sections we apply this calculation to two of the issues mentioned above .",
    "the suppression of qcd radiation into the central rapidity region is investigated in section iii .",
    "color coherence between initial and final state radiation off each of the incoming quarks and the absence of color transfer between the two quark lines in the @xmath8 process leads to strongly suppressed radiation into the rapidity range between the two final state quarks .",
    "this confirms the expectation that rapidity gaps , _",
    "i.e. _ regions of very low hadronic activity , may form between the two quark jets .",
    "the influence of processes with gluons in the initial state ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) on the radiation pattern and the effect of radiation on the average gap width are analyzed here .    in section",
    "iv we then investigate the effects of qcd radiation on forward - jet - tagging and central - jet - vetoing as discussed in ref .",
    "because of the additional jet activity the efficiency of a central - jet - veto might be severely affected by higher order qcd corrections .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case for the electroweak background of transverse @xmath9 production , but not for the heavy higgs signal itself .",
    "we calculate the signal acceptance of the tagging and vetoing techniques and find , typically , a 15% reduction of signal rates compared to the lowest order results .",
    "the processes which need to be considered are the qcd real emission corrections to weak boson scattering . in the on - shell approximation for the produced @xmath9 s",
    "this corresponds to the cross section evaluation at order @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ at tree level , of the complete process @xmath14 and all crossing related processes , like , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath15 some representative feynman graphs are shown in fig .",
    "[ figone ] and the full set of contributing graphs is outlined in the appendix .",
    "we are primarily interested in the weak boson scattering process as depicted in figs .",
    "1a and b. however , when trying to calculate the distributions of the final state quarks we need to treat the incoming weak bosons as off - shell particles .",
    "electromagnetic gauge invariance then requires to consider the @xmath16-channel photon exchange of fig .  1b",
    "together with @xmath9 bremsstrahlung off the two quark lines .",
    "we are thus lead to consider the full @xmath13 process , including all @xmath9 bremsstrahlung processes off the external quark lines , as shown , for example , in fig .",
    "questions of electromagnetic gauge invariance do not arise when considering the @xmath17-channel higgs resonance only , as depicted in fig .",
    "for a simplified definition of the higgs boson signal we shall also consider these `` @xmath17-channel resonance '' contributions in isolation .",
    "it is well known , however , that for a large higgs boson width , _",
    "i.e. _ in the case of a heavy higgs boson , the resonance contribution overestimates the production cross section of longitudinal @xmath9 s at large values of the @xmath9 pair invariant mass  @xcite .",
    "the `` @xmath17-channel resonance '' contributions should therefore only be taken as a qualitative estimate of the higgs boson signal .",
    "as an alternative means of isolating the effects of a heavy higgs boson or of the scattering of longitudinal weak bosons we shall also consider the cross section difference @xmath18 , _",
    "i.e. _ the excess events over a light higgs boson scenario",
    ".    the lowest order process , without the gluon emission considered here , has been calculated by several groups  @xcite .",
    "we obtain the real emission qcd corrections by numerically evaluating the amplitudes , using the helicity amplitude calculus of ref .  @xcite as implemented in the helas package  @xcite .",
    "fermion masses are neglected everywhere .",
    "when considering leptonic @xmath9-decays the @xmath9 propagator factors are taken in the narrow width approximation in order to eliminate additional feynman graphs which are required by gauge invariance for off - shell @xmath9 s .",
    "details are given in the appendix .",
    "a simple breit - wigner resonance form with a constant width in the timelike region is used for the higgs boson propagator .",
    "refinements can be made  @xcite , but they are not relevant in the following since we are primarily interested here in the qcd structure of weak boson fusion processes and do not aim at a precise modeling of the sm prediction for @xmath19 jet production . finally , the phase space integrals over the squared amplitudes are performed with the vegas integration package  @xcite . for the parton densities inside the proton we use",
    "set @xmath20 of ref .",
    "@xcite and we choose the geometric mean of the final state parton transverse momenta as the scale of the structure functions and of the strong coupling constant @xmath21 .",
    "because we are working in the born approximation and since we are using massless quarks throughout , the total cross section for @xmath22 comes out to be divergent and we need to impose acceptance cuts to obtain finite results .",
    "@xmath16-channel photon exchange as shown in fig .",
    "1c is singular at low @xmath23 and in addition the parton model no longer provides an adequate description in this phase space region .",
    "rather , one should use measured electromagnetic form factors of the proton . while a proper treatment of low @xmath23 photon exchange is possible",
    "@xcite one finds that this region can safely be neglected when considering signatures for weak boson scattering  @xcite .",
    "hence , we only consider the deep inelastic scattering region in the following by imposing the cut @xmath24 .",
    "annihilation diagrams contribute in processes with identical flavors on the two quark lines .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath17-channel photon into a @xmath25 pair diverges at small dijet invariant masses . again",
    "this process is unimportant for the weak boson scattering regime in which we are interested .",
    "we eliminate the singularity by requiring @xmath26 for all pairs of final state partons .",
    "finally , collinear singularities , which arise from initial state gluon radiation , are avoided by considering partons of finite transverse momentum only .",
    "these cuts eliminate all numerical divergencies .",
    "they are largely superseded by the acceptance cuts which will be made in actual experiments . throughout the following we require that all pairs of partons which satisfy the jet - identification requirements ( typically @xmath27  gev and a limited range in pseudorapidity ) are well separated in the pseudorapidity  azimuthal angle plane , @xmath28 and similarly that all decay leptons are isolated , @xmath29 additional requirements on jet and lepton transverse momenta and on the angular acceptance will be listed separately in the following sections .",
    "we will want to study the effects of the @xmath1 qcd corrections on one and two jet inclusive distributions and we would like to use the code to assess the probability of soft radiation into the rapidity interval defined by two tagging jets . a complete calculation of such observables would require the determination of virtual effects and the resummation of soft gluon emission , tasks which are clearly beyond the scope of the present paper . instead we use the `` truncated shower approximation '' ( tsa ) to obtain estimates of these observables  @xcite .    in the tsa",
    "we replace the tree level differential cross section for three parton final states , @xmath30 , by @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the smallest transverse momentum of the three final state partons . as @xmath33 the final factor in eq .",
    "( [ reg ] ) acts as a regulator of the small @xmath34 singularity .",
    "the tsa parameter @xmath35 is chosen to reproduce the lowest order cross section within a given set of acceptance cuts .",
    "for the full electroweak process the singularities associated with low @xmath23 photon exchange would introduce a very strong dependence of @xmath35 on the phase space region which is considered .",
    "this is not the case , however , for the higgs boson signal as defined by the `` @xmath17-channel resonance '' contribution .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath36-factor for the @xmath37 process is close to unity  @xcite and this process has a finite total cross section at tree level . by choosing @xmath35 such that the `` @xmath17-channel resonance '' contribution to @xmath38 reproduces the corresponding lowest order cross section ,",
    "we obtain an algorithm which agrees with the full @xmath13 calculation in the 3 jet phase space region , which allows to study 1-jet and 2-jet inclusive distributions to the same order , and which provides an excellent approximation to these distributions and to the overall normalization at full @xmath13 in the phase space region where the higgs resonance dominates .    anticipating the acceptance cuts to be used below ,",
    "we have determined the tsa parameter by matching the total higgs production cross sections in @xmath0 scattering at @xmath39  tev with one or two visible jets exceeding a minimal transverse momentum .",
    "results are given in table i. one finds that @xmath35 is quite insensitive to the value of the higgs boson mass and also varies very little with the @xmath32 cut imposed in the 1-jet inclusive case .",
    "when requiring the presence of two partons of @xmath40 20 , 40 , or 60 gev this variation is somewhat stronger , but even here the variation in @xmath35 of @xmath41  gev corresponds to normalization changes of the cross section by up to 30% only , which is within the uncertainty range of our tree level calculation .",
    "the characteristic features of the @xmath1 emission corrections to weak boson scattering can be understood in terms of the color structure of the lowest order process . in the dominant @xmath16-channel contributions ( see figs .",
    "1a  c ) no color is exchanged between the two incoming quarks ( or anti - quarks ) . for small scattering angles of these incoming fermions",
    "the color charges are accelerated rather little and the resulting `` synchrotron radiation '' of gluons occurs predominantly into the forward direction , between the beam axis and the direction of the scattered ( anti)quark .",
    "one thus expects very little hadronic activity to arise from bremsstrahlung off the hard process in the central region , between the two scattered quarks .",
    "since the energy carried by the quarks is typically much larger than the virtuality of the emitted weak bosons ( of @xmath42 ) these quarks are produced at rather large pseudorapidities , leaving a wide rapidity region with suppressed radiation  @xcite .",
    "this pattern is fundamentally different from the one expected for typical background processes ( like @xmath43 ) where color exchange between the two incoming partons leads to strong gluon radiation into all regions of the legoplot .",
    "the suppressed radiation into the central region may then lead to the formation of rapidity gaps , pseudorapidity regions of very low or no hadronic activity except for the higgs decay products  @xcite .",
    "this rapidity gap may be filled , however , by hadrons from the underlying event  @xcite and the full formation of the gap is expected to be observable only in a small fraction of all signal events where fluctuations or the absence of multiple parton interactions make the radiation pattern of the hard scattering process visible  @xcite .",
    "here we do not discuss this last question of the gap survival probability any further , rather we investigate whether the higher order qcd corrections indeed do lead to the radiation patterns suggested by the color flow arguments .",
    "processes with three quarks in the final state ( like @xmath44 @xmath45 ) might substantially alter the expected pattern .",
    "in addition , a precise knowledge of the radiation in signal vs. background events may help to distinguish the two even in the presence of an underlying event  @xcite .",
    "the features of the heavy higgs boson signal discussed above suggest a search following the strategy developed for rapidity gap events in ref .",
    "we study 2 jet inclusive @xmath46 events where both @xmath9 s decay leptonically and where the two charged decay leptons fall into the central rapidity region between the two tagging jets .",
    "more precisely we start with events containing two charged leptons of high transverse momentum in the central region , @xmath47 no hadronic jet with transverse momentum @xmath48 is allowed in the pseudorapidity interval between the two leptons . on either side of the lepton pair we search for the first jet of @xmath49  gev , @xmath50 we require the presence of two tagging jets . the pseudorapidity range between the tangents to the jet definition cones ( of radius @xmath51 )",
    "is called the `` gap region '' and the two charged leptons are required to fall into this gap region . denoting by @xmath52 the pseudorapidities of the two tagging jets we thus require @xmath53 the width of the gap region is denoted by @xmath54 the average gap width is expected to be large for weak boson scattering events but not necessarily in the phase space region where @xmath9 bremsstrahlung dominates .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ ygap ] where @xmath55 , within the acceptance requirements of eqs .",
    "( [ cutell])([defgap ] ) , is shown for the production of a @xmath56  gev higgs boson in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath39  tev .",
    "the higgs boson and longitudinal weak boson scattering contributions can be isolated by comparing with the case of a very light higgs boson , taken here as @xmath57  gev . for the lepton acceptance requirements of eq .",
    "( [ cutell ] ) the resonance contribution of the light higgs boson is completely negligible .",
    "thus the @xmath57  gev curve represents an estimate of the contributions due to @xmath9 bremsstrahlung and transverse @xmath9 production , which may be called an `` electroweak background '' to the heavy higgs boson signal .",
    "comparison of the light and heavy higgs boson curves in fig .",
    "[ ygap ] indeed shows that the signal events are produced at large average @xmath58 .",
    "the main effect of the third parton in the final state is a slight narrowing of the average gap width from @xmath59 in the lowest order calculation to @xmath60 in the full @xmath1 result ( for @xmath61  gev ) .",
    "there are at least two reasons for this effect : the possible emission of a third jet into the region between the original two quark jets redefines the gap region and in addition the emission of a third parton outside the gap region , @xmath50 at very large rapidities , raises the center of mass energy of the event and hence leads to a kinematical reduction of the gap width .",
    "neither effect is very large , however .",
    "the qcd radiation of the third parton is dominated by collinear emission close to one of the two tagging jets . because of the coherence between initial and final state radiation the emission occurs mainly between the tagging jets and the beam axes , @xmath50 outside the gap region .",
    "this effect is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ ysclosest ] where the distribution in the rapidity difference of the third ( typically soft ) parton and the closest tagging jet is shown , @xmath62 the sign is chosen such that positive @xmath63 corresponds to radiation outside the interval marked by the two tagging jets and negative values correspond to radiation towards the gap region .",
    "the edge of the gap region is visible as a step at @xmath64 which is a result of the jet separation requirement of eq .",
    "( [ rjj ] ) . clearly emission of the third parton outside the gap region is preferred .",
    "this is true both for the heavy higgs case ( solid line ) and for the electroweak transverse @xmath9 background , simulated by the @xmath57  gev scenario ( dashed line ) .",
    "the resulting radiation pattern is best appreciated by choosing the center of the gap region as the origin and then normalizing the pseudorapidity of the third parton to the gap width .",
    "this is achieved by using the variable  @xcite @xmath65 thus @xmath66 corresponds to to the gap center while @xmath67 indicates the edges of the gap region .",
    "the resulting radiation pattern , @xmath68 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ dsigdz ] . the probability for radiation into the gap region",
    "is strongly suppressed both for the heavy higgs signal and for the electroweak background . the radiation pattern which is expected for @xmath16-channel color singlet exchange",
    "is thus confirmed at @xmath1 .",
    "when trying to observe the @xmath69 decay mode of a heavy higgs boson at a hadron collider , one needs to fight serious physics backgrounds .",
    "the production of a top - quark pair with subsequent decay @xmath70 is particularly troublesome due to the large rate of this background .",
    "of somewhat lesser importance is @xmath71 pair production  @xcite .",
    "higgs boson production via weak boson fusion differs in important aspects from these background processes .",
    "forward - jet - tagging of the quark - jet(s ) off which the initial state @xmath9 s or @xmath72 s were radiated offers a powerful tool for background suppression  @xcite .",
    "in addition one can use the fact that the @xmath9 s arising from top - quark decay are always accompanied by a nearby @xmath73-quark which often manifests itself as an additional hadronic jet .",
    "when searching for the leptonic decays of the produced @xmath9 s in the central rapidity region a veto on any additional central jet constitutes a powerful tool for top - background reduction .",
    "single forward - jet - tagging and central - jet - vetoing were analysed in ref .",
    "the higgs boson signal was simulated with a full @xmath74 monte carlo program .",
    "while this appears adequate for the analysis of tagging jet distributions , the acceptance of signal events under severe central - jet - vetoing conditions might be strongly degraded by @xmath1 qcd corrections .",
    "this question can be addressed with the tools described in section ii .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we consider purely leptonic decays of the two @xmath9 bosons and concentrate on the higgs resonance region by imposing stringent lepton acceptance cuts , @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the difference of the two charged lepton transverse momenta  @xcite .    in a second step one",

    "[ ytag ] and [ pttag ] the pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of this jet , as obtained with the full @xmath78 monte carlo , are shown for a @xmath61  gev signal and the electroweak background as defined by a @xmath57  gev scenario .",
    "most of the tagging jet candidates at low @xmath79 arise from transverse @xmath9 bremsstrahlung and hence a stringent rapidity cut on the tagging jet is highly efficient for the heavy higgs signal .",
    "the transverse momentum of the tagging jet in higgs signal events is typically quite low , while the electroweak background distribution is rather flat , reflecting the dominance of @xmath9 bremsstrahlung : the strong lepton @xmath34 cut selects high @xmath34 @xmath9-bosons which were radiated off high transverse momentum quarks .",
    "the tagging jet distributions are quite similar to the @xmath74 calculation which , therefore , are not shown separately . as in ref .",
    "@xcite signal events are selected by requiring the presence of a tagging jet of @xmath80 because of the presence of a third colored parton in the final state the full @xmath78 calculation yields a larger probability to find an additional jet in the central region than the corresponding result without qcd corrections .",
    "let us define the veto jet candidate as the remaining parton , other than the tagging jet , with largest transverse momentum .",
    "the pseudorapidity distribution of this veto jet candidate is shown in fig .",
    "[ etaveto ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a veto of any jet in the central region satisfying the conditions latexmath:[\\[\\label{cutveto }    was found to provide adequate top background rejection while retaining most of the signal events when neglecting qcd corrections to the higgs signal .",
    "the cross sections for the higgs boson signal after vetoing central jets with varying minimum transverse momentum requirements are shown in table ii for both the lowest order `` 2 parton calculation '' and the @xmath1 `` 3 parton calculation '' . also given",
    "are the efficiencies of retaining the higgs signal after central - jet - vetoing .",
    "the 100% level corresponds to the cross section difference @xmath82 before rejecting events with jets of @xmath83 and transverse momenta as listed in the table .    in the phase space region which is dominated by @xmath9 bremsstrahlung ( as simulated by the @xmath57  gev scenario ) qcd radiation does indeed strongly affect the efficiency of a central - jet - veto .",
    "in fact this leads to a further reduction of the electroweak background compared to the higgs boson signal . at @xmath1 the signal acceptance of the central - jet - veto",
