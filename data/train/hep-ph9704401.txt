    "during the last five years the high - energy physics community has investigated the viability of a new high - energy linear @xmath0 collider  @xcite . according to the various designs for this so - called next linear collider ( nlc )",
    ", an energy in the range between 500 and 1500  gev seems feasible . by using the back - scattered laser - beam technique  @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to convert the @xmath1 beams into photon beams with comparable energy and luminosity . in this way the nlc could be operated as a @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 collider .",
    "such a versatile machine should prove an excellent tool in our quest to understand nature .",
    "it will provide stringent tests of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions  @xcite , making it highly sensitive to signals of new physics .",
    "if any physics beyond the sm exists , it will reveal itself in the production of new particles ( direct signals ) or in deviations in the interactions between the sm particles ( indirect signals ) .",
    "this survey is dedicated to the role played by the w boson . in this context",
    "the most important issues to be addressed at the nlc are the investigation of the triple and quartic gauge - boson couplings , and a detailed study of the symmetry - breaking sector .",
    "this should shed some light on two important outstanding problems in present - day high - energy physics .",
    "the first question concerns the nature of the non - abelian interactions between the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "experiments at the tevatron and lep1 have provided us with the first direct  @xcite and indirect  @xcite evidence for the existence of such interactions .",
    "the results are , however , far from conclusive , since @xmath6 deviations from the sm couplings are still allowed . at future high - energy collider",
    "experiments the sensitivity to these non - abelian gauge - boson couplings will be increased significantly .",
    "this will either allow a verification of the sm couplings at the per - mil level or open a window to physics beyond the sm .",
    "the second question that should be addressed at the nlc concerns the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . are the longitudinal weak gauge - boson modes indeed generated by means of the sm higgs mechanism , or has nature chosen another option ? in this context there are two scenarios for the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector . in one scenario",
    "the theory of the fundamental interactions is assumed to be applicable to very high energies , i.e.  up to the grand - unification scale or planck mass ( @xmath7@xmath8  gev ) .",
    "in such a scenario ( e.g.  supersymmetry ) the symmetry - breaking sector consists of one or more elementary ( pseudo-)scalar higgs fields , which are weakly coupled at low energies .",
    "the mass of the lowest - lying higgs state is predicted to be relatively small , i.e.  below 200  gev @xcite .",
    "the second scenario involves the possibility of having new strong interactions at tev energies , related to the mechanism of mass generation .",
    "such a scenario in general excludes the presence of a low - lying higgs state ; in fact , higgs - like states might be absent altogether . whatever the underlying theory of the strong interactions may be",
    ", these strong interactions will manifest themselves in the form of strongly - interacting longitudinal gauge bosons .",
    "after all , these longitudinal gauge - boson modes are a direct consequence of the mechanism of mass generation .",
    "this is reminiscent of the role played by the pions in hadron dynamics . in this survey",
    "the emphasis will be on the strongly - interacting scenario , since it entails the absence of direct signals at low energies . from the viewpoint of w - boson physics this is the most interesting situation .    in order to successfully achieve the physics goals at the nlc ,",
    "a very accurate knowledge of the sm predictions for the various observables is mandatory .",
    "it has no use trying to perform high - precision tests of non - abelian gauge - boson couplings and strongly - interacting longitudinal gauge - boson interactions when the sm predictions do not have a matching precision .",
    "to this end a critical assessment is given as to what sm ingredients are required in this respect .",
    "this involves a proper understanding of radiative corrections as well as a proper treatment of finite - width effects .",
    "the weak gauge bosons are unstable particles and experience has learned us that gauge invariance is in jeopardy when it comes to including the finite widths of these particles .",
    "needless to say that this can have large repercussions on the reliability of the sm predictions .",
    "the outline of this survey is as follows . in section  2 a discussion",
    "is given of the process of longitudinal gauge - boson scattering and its intimate relation to the symmetry - breaking sector . in section  3 the topic of physics beyond the sm",
    "is addressed in a more systematic way , using the concept of effective lagrangians and anomalous couplings . in section  4 ,",
    "finally , the sm predictions are considered , with emphasis on the issue of gauge invariance .",
    "as mentioned before we will assume the absence of a low - lying higgs state or any alternative thereof , excluding the presence of direct signals of these states at sub - tev energies .",
    "the most sensitive probe of the symmetry - breaking sector will in that case be longitudinal gauge - boson scattering , since the longitudinal gauge - boson modes are a direct consequence of the mechanism of mass generation .      in the sm",
    "the longitudinal gauge - boson modes are supplied by the would - be nambu  goldstone bosons , leaving behind just one elementary scalar higgs field ( h ) .",
    "this is achieved by the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath9 symmetry through the higgs mechanism . in order to reveal the distinctive nature of the longitudinal gauge - boson modes ,",
    "high energies are required . at rest",
    "longitudinal ( @xmath10 ) and transverse ( @xmath11 ) modes are related by mere rotations , but at high energies they are quite different , since only the longitudinal modes are affected by boosts in the direction of flight . a simple investigation of the polarization vector @xmath12 of a massive gauge boson with momentum @xmath13 , mass @xmath14 , and velocity @xmath15 reveals : @xmath16 from this it should be clear that any amplitude involving longitudinal gauge bosons has the tendency to diverge at high energies as a result of factors @xmath17 . in gauge theories , however , gauge cancellations take place , resulting in properly behaved cross - sections for all energies , i.e.  cross - sections that do not grow as a positive power of @xmath18 .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the leading - energy term @xmath19 in ( [ polvec ] ) can be related by means of ward identities to the corresponding would - be goldstone mode , which is not subject to gauge cancellations .",
    "consider now the process @xmath20 in the limit @xmath21 , where @xmath18 stands for the energy of the particles in the centre - of - mass system .",
    "at this point we can make use of the equivalence theorem  @xcite , which states that for @xmath22 the amplitudes for longitudinal gauge - boson scattering are in leading - energy approximation equivalent to the amplitudes for the corresponding would - be goldstone bosons .",
    "the terms involving the remnant @xmath23 occurring in ( [ polvec ] ) are suppressed by powers of @xmath24 .",
    "hence , it suffices to study the process @xmath25 ( see fig.[fichi ] ) , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the would - be goldstone bosons responsible for generating the masses of the @xmath28 and z gauge bosons , respectively .",

    "naively the amplitude for the process @xmath37 is expected to diverge like @xmath38 , but after the gauge cancellations have taken place an @xmath39 behaviour remains . to be more precise : @xmath40 .",
    "this behaviour is purely a consequence of the fact that the symmetry is broken and does not contain any information on the dynamics responsible for the symmetry breaking , i.e.  the higgs .",
    "it is prescribed by the low - energy theorem ( let )  @xcite corresponding to the broken symmetry , which states that the would - be goldstone bosons decouple at low energies ( up to gauge and yukawa couplings ) .",
    "we will come back to this point later on .",
    "obviously something must happen in the tev range in order to salvage unitarity , after all the sm is unitary by construction ; in other words , strong - interaction effects are expected in that regime .",
    "indeed , in the heavy - higgs approximation the quartic higgs self couplings @xmath41 are large and higher - order corrections @xmath42 can not be discarded .",
    "two natural scales govern the dynamics of these strong - interaction effects : @xmath43 ( resonance ) and @xmath44  tev ( corrections ) .",
    "the goldstone bosons , which decouple at low energies , will start to interact strongly if @xmath45 . as a result of the equivalence theorem , the same holds for the longitudinal gauge bosons .",
    "recapitulating : the let behaviour of longitudinal gauge - boson scattering at intermediate energies ( @xmath46 ) is a signature of a strongly - interacting symmetry - breaking sector , since it would be absent if the higgs boson were to be light .",
    "in contrast , the longitudinal gauge - boson interactions do not yet appear to be strong at these energies .",
    "the actual strong dynamics only shows up when the energy approaches the realm of the symmetry - breaking sector .",
    "we can now turn to a more general discussion of a strongly - interacting symmetry - breaking sector . to this end",
    "all other interactions ( like weak and yukawa interactions ) are for the moment simply neglected .",
    "two guiding principles are relevant for the discussion .",
    "the first thing to note is that the sm higgs sector has a larger symmetry than just the local @xmath9 .",
    "the higgs lagrangian @xmath47 with @xmath48 the complex higgs doublet , is also symmetric under global @xmath49 transformations .",
    "this corresponds to the symmetry under rotation of the four components .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking has taken place only the symmetry under rotation of the would - be goldstone bosons is apparent .",
    "this ( isospin ) symmetry is usually referred to as the custodial @xmath50 symmetry . as far",
    "as strong interactions are concerned the same symmetry applies to the weak gauge bosons , being related to the would - be goldstone bosons by the equivalence theorem . in this context both @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "behave as isospin triplets ( @xmath53 ) . in the sm",
    "this symmetry is ( weakly ) broken by hypercharge interactions .",
    "this leads to the relation @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the weak mixing angle .",
    "the fact that the @xmath50 symmetry is not broken by the strong symmetry - breaking interactions is reflected by the observation that the so - called @xmath56 parameter , representing the relative strength of neutral- and charged - current interactions at low energies , is close to unity : @xmath57 . in view of the strong experimental restrictions on this @xmath56 parameter ,",
    "any symmetry - breaking mechanism other than the one adopted in the sm should better obey the custodial @xmath50 symmetry .",
    "the second guiding principle is provided by the let corresponding to the spontaneous symmetry - breaking mechanism .",
    "the breaking of the ( axial ) symmetry , being of the order of the masses of the gauge bosons , is only a weak one when compared with the scale governing the strongly - interacting sector . in order to assess the implications of this observation ,",

    "the heavy higgs field can be integrated out , resulting in a non - renormalizable chiral lagrangian : @xmath64                    [ \\partial^\\mu \\sigma]\\right )                    + \\mbox{two terms with four derivatives } + \\cdots    \\label{chiral}\\ ] ] in this limit the would - be goldstone fields @xmath65 are related to the original @xmath26 and @xmath27 fields according to @xmath66 the chiral lagrangian ( [ chiral ] ) represents the effective interactions between the would - be goldstone bosons in the heavy - higgs limit .",

    "its coefficient is fixed by the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale @xmath68 .",
    "the terms in the expansion with a larger number of derivatives are linked to the dynamics of the symmetry - breaking sector .",
    "they are suppressed by factors @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the generic scale for the strong interactions ( and resonances ) . in the case of the sm",

    "what can we learn from longitudinal gauge - boson scattering , bearing in mind the above guiding principles for a general strongly - interacting symmetry - breaking sector ? applying the equivalence theorem , this is equivalent to an analysis of the generic process @xmath71 involving identical massless spinless particles ( as far as the strong interactions are concerned ) . exploiting crossing symmetry and bose symmetry for identical particles",

    "in order to successfully achieve the physics goals at the nlc , a very accurate knowledge of the sm predictions for the various observables is mandatory .",
    "this involves a proper understanding of radiative corrections as well as a proper treatment of finite - width effects .",
    "as has become clear from the previous sections , the w - boson physics studies at the nlc cover a large variety of processes with photons and/or fermions in the initial and final state .",
    "after all , the massive gauge bosons are unstable particles and can only be investigated through their decay products . if complete sets of graphs contributing to such a process are taken into account , the associated matrix elements are in principle gauge - invariant",
    ". however , the massive gauge bosons that appear as intermediate particles can give rise to poles @xmath180 if they are treated as stable particles .",
    "this can be cured by introducing the finite decay width in one way or another , while at the same time preserving gauge independence and , through a proper high - energy behavior , unitarity . in field theory ,",
    "such widths arise naturally from the imaginary parts of higher - order diagrams describing the gauge - boson self - energies , resummed to all orders .",
    "this procedure has been used with great success in the past : indeed , the z resonance can be described to very high numerical accuracy .",
    "however , in doing a dyson summation of self - energy graphs , we are singling out only a very limited subset of all the possible higher - order diagrams .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that one often ends up with a result that retains some gauge dependence .    till",
    "recently two approaches for dealing with unstable gauge bosons were popular in the construction of lowest - order monte carlo generators .",
    "the first one involves the systematic replacement @xmath181 , also for @xmath182 . here",
    "@xmath183 denotes the physical width of the gauge boson with mass m and momentum @xmath184 .",
    "this scheme is called the ` fixed - width scheme ' . as in general the resonant diagrams",
    "are not gauge - invariant by themselves , this substitution will destroy gauge invariance .",
    "moreover , it has no physical motivation , since in perturbation theory the propagator for space - like momenta does not develop an imaginary part .",
    "consequently , unitarity is violated in this scheme . to improve on the latter another approach",
    "can be adopted , involving the use of a running width @xmath185 instead of the constant one @xmath186 ( ` running - width scheme ' ) .",
    "this , however , still can not cure the problem with gauge invariance .    at this point",
    "one might ask oneself the legitimate question whether the gauge - breaking terms are numerically relevant or not .",
    "after all , the gauge breaking is caused by the finite decay width and is , as such , in principle suppressed by powers of @xmath187 . from lep1 we know that gauge breaking can be negligible for all practical purposes .",
    "however , the presence of small scales can amplify the gauge - breaking terms .",
    "this is for instance the case for almost collinear space - like photons or longitudinal gauge bosons at high energies , involving scales of @xmath188 ( with @xmath189 the momentum of the involved gauge boson ) . in these situations the external current coupled to the photon or to",
    "the longitudinal gauge boson becomes approximately proportional to @xmath189 .",
    "in other words , in these regimes sensible theoretical predictions are only possible if the amplitudes with external currents replaced by the corresponding gauge - boson momenta fulfill appropriate ward identities .    in order to substantiate these statements ,",
    "a truly gauge - invariant scheme is needed .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that any such scheme is arbitrary to a greater or lesser extent : since the dyson summation must necessarily be taken to all orders of perturbation theory , and we are not able to compute the complete set of _ all _ feynman diagrams to _ all _ orders , the various schemes differ even if they lead to formally gauge - invariant results .",
    "bearing this in mind , we need some physical motivation for choosing a particular scheme . in this context",
    "two options can be mentioned , which fulfill the criteria of gauge invariance and physical motivation .",
    "the first option is the so - called ` pole scheme '  @xcite . in this scheme one",
    "decomposes the complete amplitude according to the pole structure by expanding around the poles , e.g.  @xmath190 .",
    "as the physically observable residues of the poles are gauge - invariant , gauge invariance is not broken if the finite width is taken into account in the pole terms @xmath191 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there exists some controversy in the literature  @xcite about the ` correct ' procedure for doing this and about the range of validity of the pole scheme , especially in the vicinity of thresholds .",
    "the second option is based on the philosophy of trying to determine and include the minimal set of feynman diagrams that is necessary for compensating the gauge violation caused by the self - energy graphs .",
    "this is obviously the theoretically most satisfying solution , but it may cause an increase in the complexity of the matrix elements and a consequent slowing down of the numerical calculations . for the gauge bosons we are guided by the observation that the lowest - order decay widths are exclusively given by the imaginary parts of the fermion loops in the one - loop self - energies .",
    "it is therefore natural to perform a dyson summation of these fermionic one - loop self - energies and to include the other possible one - particle - irreducible fermionic one - loop corrections ( ` fermion - loop scheme ' )  @xcite . for the process",
    "@xmath192 ( see fig.[eeww ] ) , this amounts to adding the fermionic triple gauge - boson vertex corrections .",
    "the complete set of fermionic contributions forms a gauge - independent subset and obeys all ward identities exactly , even with resummed propagators  @xcite . as mentioned above",
    ", the validity of the ward identities guarantees a proper behavior of the cross - sections in the presence of collinear photons and at high energies in the presence of longitudinal gauge - boson modes . on top of that , within the fermion - loop scheme the appropriately renormalized matrix elements for the generic process @xmath192 can be formulated in terms of effective born matrix elements , using the familiar language of running couplings  @xcite .",
    "a numerical comparison of the various schemes  @xcite confirms the importance of not violating the ward identities . for the process @xmath193 , a process that is particularly important for studying triple gauge - boson couplings , the impact of violating the electromagnetic @xmath168 gauge invariance was demonstrated in  @xcite . of the above - mentioned schemes only the running - width scheme violates @xmath168 gauge invariance .",
    "the associated gauge - breaking terms are enhanced in a disastrous way by a factor of @xmath194 , in view of the fact that the electron may emit a virtual ( space - like ) photon with @xmath195 as small as @xmath196 .",
    "a similar observation can be made at high energies when some of the intermediate gauge bosons become effectively longitudinal . there",
    "too the running - width scheme renders completely unreliable results  @xcite . in processes involving more intermediate gauge bosons ,",
    "e.g.  @xmath197 ( see fig.[lltoll]a ) , also the fixed - width scheme breaks down at high energies as a result of breaking @xmath198 gauge invariance .      by employing the fermion - loop scheme all one - particle - irreducible fermionic one - loop corrections can be embedded in the tree - level matrix elements .",
    "this results in running couplings , propagator functions , vertex functions , etc . however , there is still the question about the bosonic corrections .",
    "such corrections might mimic the presence of anomalous gauge - boson interactions if they are not taken into account properly .",
    "precision in order to study anomalous triple gauge - boson couplings at the @xmath199 level .",
    "these anomalous couplings are non - minimal and therefore lead to enhanced effects . ] a large part of the bosonic corrections , as e.g.  the leading qed corrections , factorize and can be treated by means of a convolution , using the fermion - loop - improved cross - sections in the integration kernels ( see e.g.  appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "this allows the inclusion of higher - order qed corrections and soft - photon exponentiation . in this way",
    "various important effects can be covered . in this respect",
    "especially the emission of hard photons from the initial state is noteworthy  @xcite .",
    "the associated hard - photon boost effects will lead to a redistribution of phase space , which affects the angular distributions .",
    "also the polarization of the produced gauge bosons is affected by the presence of such boosts .",
    "the best - suited observables for probing the np sector normally involve small cross - sections and are therefore extremely sensitive to redistribution effects .",
    "for instance , observables related to longitudinal gauge bosons will receive large corrections from the tranverse modes . in order to reduce the effects from the hard photons to a minimum , appropriate cuts on the total final - state energy and momentum",
    "have to be imposed .    only taking into account the ( leading ) factorizing bosonic corrections",
    "is not sufficient .",
    "the remaining bosonic corrections can be large , especially at high energies where logarithmic corrections @xmath200",
    "emerge  @xcite .",
    "in order to include the remaining bosonic corrections one might attempt to extend the fermion - loop scheme . in the context of the background - field method a dyson summation of bosonic self - energies can be performed without violating the ward identities  @xcite . however , the resulting matrix elements depend on the quantum gauge parameter at the loop level that is not completely taken into account . as mentioned before , the perturbation series has to be truncated ; in that sense the dependence on the quantum gauge parameter could be viewed as a parametrization of the associated ambiguity .    as a more appealing strategy one might adopt a hybrid scheme , adding the remaining bosonic loop corrections by means of the pole scheme .",
    "this is gauge - invariant and contains the well - known bosonic corrections for the production of on - shell gauge bosons ( in particular w - boson pairs  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , if the quality of the pole scheme were to degrade in certain regions of phase - space , the associated error is reduced by factors of @xmath201 .",
    "it should be noted that the application of the pole scheme to photonic corrections requires some special care , because in that case terms proportional to @xmath202 complicate the pole expansion  @xcite .",
