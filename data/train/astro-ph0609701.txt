    "one of the most challenging tasks is the separation of the astrophysical components superimposed on the cmb , usually denominated `` foregrounds '' .    on angular scales larger than about @xmath1",
    "the dominant foregrounds in the relevant spectral region are diffuse emissions from our own galaxy ( de zotti et al .",

    "2003b ) , while at higher frequencies thermal dust ( schlegel , finkbeiner , davies 1998 ; finkbeiner , schlegel , davies 1999 ) takes over . on smaller angular scales foreground fluctuations are dominated by several populations of extra - galactic sources , with different spectral behaviour : radio sources , dusty galaxies and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect from galaxy clusters .",
    "a big deal of work has been recently dedicated to develop algorithms performing component separation , based on different ideas and techniques from signal processing science .",
    "several algorithms , referred to as `` non - blind '' , assume a perfect knowledge of the frequency dependence of sources .",
    "the most widely used techniques exploiting this approach are wiener filtering ( wf ; tegmark & efstathiou 1996 ; bouchet , prunet , & sethi 1999 ) and the maximum entropy method ( mem ; hobson et al .",

    "this fact has motivated `` blind '' approaches , which do not make any assumption on the spectral shape . particularly promising",

    "we estimate the precision of the mixing matrix and cmb power spectrum recovery . in section 7",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "we assume that the observed sky radiation is the superposition of @xmath3 different physical processes whose spatial pattern is independent of frequency spectrum : @xmath4 if we have a set of equal resolution observations at @xmath5 different frequencies , the observed signal can be modelled as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath5-vector of observations , @xmath8 is a @xmath9 mixing matrix , @xmath10 is the @xmath3-vector of sources and @xmath11 the @xmath5-vector of instrumental noise .",

    "2006 ) .",
    "if both the mixing matrix @xmath8 and the source vector @xmath10 are unknown , the problem is unsolvable without additional hypotheses .",
    "the cca method exploits information on the second order statistics of the data .",
    "the covariance matrix of a generic signal @xmath21 , defined in a two dimensional space with coordinates @xmath22 , is : @xmath23 [ \\mathbf{x}(\\xi+\\tau,\\eta+\\psi)-\\mu]^t \\rangle \\label{covmat},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes expectation under the appropriate joint probability distribution , @xmath25 is the mean vector and the superscript @xmath26 means transposition .",

    "( [ model ] ) we can easily derive a relation between the data covariance matrix @xmath32 at a certain lag , the source covariance matrix @xmath33 at the same lag , the mixing matrix @xmath8 , and the noise covariance matrix @xmath34 : @xmath35 this relation allows us to estimate the mixing operator @xmath8 from the covariance matrix @xmath32 of the data .",
    "note that it implicitly assumes that the source and the noise processes are stationary .",
    "this is true all across the sky for the cmb , but only within small sky patches for the foregrounds .",
    "for this reason , it is convenient to section the sky into patches within which foregrounds have approximately uniform properties , and apply the method to individual patches . in this way",
    "the only remaining issue is the non - stationarity of noise , depending on the particular scanning strategy adopted , which we do not consider in this work .",
    "if the noise process can be assumed to be signal - independent , white and zero - mean , for @xmath36 @xmath34 is a diagonal matrix whose elements are the noise variances in the frequency channels of the instrument , while for @xmath37 @xmath34 is the null @xmath38 matrix . anyway ,",
    "if @xmath34 deviates significantly from this ideal model , various methods are available to estimate the noise covariance function : for example it can be empirically determined using noise maps from monte carlo simulations .",
    "once we have a model for @xmath34 , we only have to calculate @xmath32 for a large enough number of nonzero shift pairs @xmath27 to estimate both @xmath8 and @xmath33 . in practice , however , we need to parameterize the mixing matrix to reduce the number of unknowns .",
    "we note that for the scaling ambiguity , we can normalize our mixing matrix to have all elements of a reference row equal to 1 .",
    "the main product of cca is then an estimate of the mixing matrix .",
    "hence this can be considered a `` model learning '' algorithm .",
    "once the mixing matrix have been recovered , source separation can be performed with traditional non - blind methods , such as wf or mem , or other bayesian inversion techniques .      to choose a suitable parameterization for @xmath8 we use the fact that its elements are proportional to the spectra of astrophysical sources , of which we have some knowledge coming from the theory or from complementary observations .",
    "the main diffuse components present in the planck channels are , in addition to the cmb , the galactic dust , synchrotron and free - free emissions .",
    "the frequency dependencies of the cmb and of the free - free are known ; in terms of the antenna temperature we have : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the planck constant , @xmath42 the boltzmann constant , @xmath43 k. conversely , the frequency scalings of synchrotron and dust are not known a priori .",
    "the simplest model compatible with observations involves only one parameter for each source , the spectral index @xmath44 or the emissivity index @xmath45 , respectively : @xmath46 @xmath47 the mixing matrix accounting for all these sources is then of four columns and of as many rows as the number of channels .",

    "when we work with the high frequency planck channels , synchrotron and free - free can be neglected , so the mixing matrix has two columns , one for the cmb and one for the dust , and only one parameter , @xmath45 .",

    "( [ covmat ] ) is the fundamental tool used to identify the mixing operator .",

    "we have a very easy way to define the shift pairs @xmath27 .",

    "the data we are working with are very different from this simple case : they are patches extracted from healpix ( grski et al .",
    "2005 ) all sky maps , so they are sampled in a sphere rather than in a plane and also the grid is not regular .",
    "we note that even in the simplest case the selected region is not exactly rectangular because of the diamond shape of pixels and of the surface curvature .    to apply the method we need to map the selected patch into a geometrically identical one , shifted by @xmath27 .",
    "this can be done only in an approximate way with the healpix pixelization , and is easier in the equatorial region . in the present application we study galactic foregrounds where they are more intense , i.e. at not too high galactic latitudes .",
    "we therefore use galactic coordinates and refer to the grid defined by galactic parallels and meridians to calculate shifts .    with the healpix ring ordering scheme , pixels with subsequent indices are subsequent in longitude , so that , for any integer @xmath51 , a set of pixels @xmath59 simply map into the set @xmath60 , shifted by @xmath51 pixels in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the shift in latitude is trickier .",
    "we proceeded associating to each pixel the shifted one closest to having the same longitude and the latitude increased by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mean pixel size .",
    "clearly , in this case @xmath63 is not exactly equal for all shifted pixels .",
    "however , our shifts are rather small ( see below ) , so that , if we are not too close to the galactic poles , the approximation is sufficiently good .    to choose convenient values for the number of shifts @xmath64 and the step @xmath51 , we should care both about efficiency and conditioning .",
    "it is obvious that , if @xmath64 is large , the method becomes computationally demanding . on the other hand ,",
    "a too small @xmath64 can make the problem ill conditioned , thus leading to a lack of convergence .",
    "the step @xmath51 should be chosen in order to avoid both redundancy ( if @xmath51 is small , some of the covariance matrices are nearly equal ) and degeneracy ( if @xmath51 is too large , some covariance matrices vanish ) . in practice , the choice can be made empirically , for any @xmath51 , by increasing @xmath64 progressively until convergence is reached .      to solve eq .",
    "( [ problem ] ) and estimate the parameters that identify the mixing matrix and the source covariance matrices , we minimize the residual between the theoretical quantities based on the proposed solution and the corresponding quantities evaluated empirically from the available data .",

    "we used simulated annealing ( sa , aarts & korst , 1989 ) , which exploits an analogy between the way in which a metal cools and freezes into a minimum energy crystalline structure and the search for a minimum in a more general system .    the major advantage of sa over other methods is its ability to avoid becoming trapped at local minima , which can be very nasty in our case .",
    "the algorithm employs a random search which not only accepts changes that decrease the objective function @xmath69 , but also some changes that increase it .",
    "the latter are accepted with a probability : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an increment in @xmath69 and @xmath26 is a control parameter , known as the system `` temperature '' .",
    "avoidance of local minima is anyway dependent on the `` annealing schedule '' : the choice of the initial temperature , how many iterations are performed at each temperature , and how much the temperature is decreased at each step as cooling proceeds .",

    ", we used the planck channels from 30 to 143 ghz .",
    "the resolution of all the maps had to be degraded to that of the 30 ghz channel ( @xmath73 ) . to test the performances achievable with the full planck resolution of @xmath74",
    ", we repeated the analysis with the high frequency channels from 217 to 545 ghz , where the sources to account for are only cmb and dust .",
    "the noise maps we initially added to each channel were gaussian ( with the rms levels reported in table[tab : planck ] ) and uncorrelated : in this case , the only noise term in eq .",
    "( [ problem ] ) is @xmath75 , which is a diagonal matrix whose elements are the noise variances for each channel .",
    "the smoothing process applied to degrade the channels to the 30 ghz resolution not only changes the noise variances , but also introduces noise correlation , so in principle the terms @xmath76 do not vanish for @xmath77 .",
    "nevertheless , we carried out our tests assuming uncorrelated gaussian noise : we then consider only the diagonal matrix @xmath75 , whose elements are the variances measured after smoothing each noise map to the @xmath73 resolution .",
    "this approximation is not the best we could do in dealing with noise , but it was purposely adopted to investigate the effect of errors on noise modelling .",
    "the lf set includes 5 planck channels , centered at 30 , 44 , 70 , 100 , and 143 ghz .",
    "since we have 4 sources ( cmb , synchrotron , free - free , and thermal dust ) the mixing matrix has 4 columns and we want to recover the synchrotron and the dust spectral indices . since all the maps have been degraded to a resolution of @xmath73 , we operate with the healpix parameter nside=512 , corresponding to a pixel size of about 7.    the number of shifts allowing a good conditioning of the problem is found to be @xmath78 .",
    "the value of @xmath50 and the pixel size constrain the amplitude of the shifts that can be used to calculate the covariance matrices : the minimum shift must correspond to one pixel ( @xmath79 ) ; the maximum one can not generally exceed @xmath80 to ensure that all covariance matrices are non - null .",
    "we chose @xmath81 , which corresponds roughly to our beam size .",
    "there is a second effect of the resolution : to have sufficient statistics , the number of pixels per patch has to be at least @xmath82 . with the adopted pixel size",
    ", this corresponds to a patch area of @xmath83 , which is not optimal for the reconstruction of the spectral indices that may vary widely with the position . in the synchrotron template",
    "we use here ( giardino et al .",

    "we used patches of @xmath85 for the lowest latitudes and increased the longitudinal dimension for higher latitudes to roughly preserve the patch area .",
    "we sectioned the sky with patches centered at longitudes @xmath86 and increasing latitudes . in total",
    "we analyzed the @xmath87 of the sky with @xmath88 .",
    "from the first tests we learned that to get a good spectral index reconstruction we need a broad frequency range . this can be achieved by taking into account additional information from other surveys . to this end , we included in our analysis the 857 ghz planck map and the haslam et al .",
    "( 1982 ) 408 mhz map , taken as dust and synchrotron templates , setting to 0 all the elements of the mixing matrix except the synchrotron one at 408 mhz , and the dust one at 857 ghz .      in the planck 217 , 353 and 545 ghz channels we can neglect the synchrotron and free - free emissions , so that we are left with cmb and dust , and the only parameter to recover is the dust emissivity index @xmath45 .",
    "these channels allow us to work at the best planck resolution : the beam is of @xmath74 , so we can use nside=2048 , corresponding to a pixel size of about 1.7 .",
    "we dissected the sky into patches of size @xmath89 , centered at longitudes @xmath90 and latitudes @xmath91 . in total , we then analyzed @xmath92 of the sky .    in this case , we did not need to include other channels to help reconstructing the mixing matrix .",
    "we used a shift step @xmath93 , corresponding to an angular size of @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "since , on purpose , the parameters to be determined do not directly reflect those defining the sky model , the errors on our estimates can not be simply derived comparing our results with the `` true '' values , simply because the latter in general do not exist .",
    "in particular , the synchrotron spectral index is varying in the sky , and the dust emission is modeled by a two - component spectrum , so they need to be treated as we describe below .",
    "the output of our method is the estimated mixing matrix normalized at a reference frequency @xmath96 .",

    "we then define our errors as : @xmath105 @xmath106                   figure  [ fig : uno ] refers to the analysis of the lf set and shows the mean values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , over 100 simulations of the sky , as a function of longitude for latitudes @xmath109 .",
    "the error bars , generally very small and barely visible in the figure , are the standard deviations of @xmath107 and @xmath110 from the mean .",
    "their small values imply that the errors in the spectral index recovery are mainly systematic ; for both spectral indices , part of the systematic error comes from the fact that the models we assume for the analysis differ from those defining the sky model .",
    "we clearly have problems with the estimation of the synchrotron spectral index , while the errors on @xmath45 are generally small .",
    "we have checked that this effect is due to confusion between synchrotron and free - free .",
    "the free - free emission is highly concentrated on the galactic plane but depresses the mean spectral index of the combined emission over entire patches , thus biasing the estimate of the synchrotron spectral index",
    ". a better recovery of the latter would be possible with high spatial resolution maps , so that we have a sufficient number of pixels within a much smaller range of galactic latitudes .    with the angular resolution adopted here ,",
    "this effect can be minimized by cutting out a strip of a few degrees around the galactic plane .",
    "the situation is substantially better even with a cut of @xmath111 around the galactic equator , and improves further if we enlarge the cut to @xmath112 ( fig .",

    "we computed the mean errors on synchrotron and dust indices over 100 monte carlo iterations for each patch , and the mean and standard deviation of errors obtained for patches at the same latitude .",
    "the bars are the standard deviations around the mean over longitudes .    for the lf set , while the dust index is always reconstructed with an error of @xmath113 , the error on the synchrotron spectral index increases with latitude .",
    "this is due to the fact that the substantial spatial variability of the synchrotron spectral index , implied by the giardino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) model , is increasingly difficult to recover as the synchrotron signal weakens with increasing galactic latitude .",
    "thanks to the higher angular resolution of the hf set and to the lack of other relevant diffuse components besides cmb and dust in this frequency range , the cca allows us to reconstruct the dust spectral index with an error @xmath114 over the full latitude range analyzed .",
    "the cca procedure can be viewed as the first step ( learning ) in component separation . in a further step ,",
    "the mixing matrix estimated by this approach can be input to non - blind separation tecniques .",

    "since at the moment the optimal component separation method exploiting the information recovered by cca has still to be developed , we try to estimate the errors in the cmb spectrum under conservative hypotheses .",

    "( [ 29 ] ) can be used to correct the estimated spectra .    to evaluate the uncertainties on the estimated cmb spectrum",
    "when the mixing matrix is not known exactly , we used a monte carlo approach : we generated 100 mixing matrices @xmath115 drawn from the probability distribution for the spectral indices described below .",
    "for each matrix we computed the @xmath143 from eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) . for the lf",
    "set , these errors have been evaluated at the reference frequency of 100 ghz using four sources ( cmb , synchrotron , dust and free - free ) and five channels ( 30 , 44 , 70 , 100 , 143 ghz ) . for the hf set we used two sources ( cmb and dust ) and three channels ( 217 , 353 , 545 ghz ) , with the reference frequency at 217 ghz . for each channel",
    "set , we used the all - sky power spectra of the reference source templates as the input spectra @xmath144 .",
    "the @xmath145 for each channel have been calculated as : @xmath146where @xmath147 is the number of pixels , and the rms pixel noise values @xmath148 have been taken from table [ tab : planck ] .",
    "as we have been working with sky patches , we should perform monte carlo simulations patch by patch , using the appropriate basis , and then combine the information over the whole sky .",
    "however , since we only want to get an indicative amplitude for @xmath143 , we only performed our trials on a single set of all - sky simulations , decomposed into spherical harmonics . on the other hand , since an adequate strategy to combine the results obtained on patches to achieve a coordinated all - sky component separation has yet to be developed , we will confine ourselves to the multipole range constrained by the patch size .    for each iteration of our monte carlo simulations , we generated the mixing matrix from synchrotron and dust spectral indices that are gaussian - distributed around their true values @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "in particular , we used standard deviations of 0.1 and 0.05 , respectively , for the distributions of synchrotron and dust indices in the lf channels , and a standard deviation of 0.03 for the dust index in the hf channels .",
    "these values are upper limits to the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : errvslat ] .",
    "we then exploited eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) to compute the error on the cmb power spectrum for both the wiener filter and the pseudo - inverse filter . from our monte carlo simulations , we computed the average value of @xmath143 , which is the total error on the cmb power spectrum estimation .",
    "we also estimated the standard deviation @xmath149 of the random variable : @xmath150where @xmath151 is obtained for @xmath135 , and assumed it as the error on the cmb spectrum due to the estimation of the mixing matrix .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cont_lf ] and [ fig : cont_hf ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_lf ] we show the errors for both the wiener filter and the pseudo - inverse filter from the lf channel data , as functions of the multipole @xmath152 , together with the original cmb power spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : cont_hf ] displays the corresponding results for the hf channels .",
    "all the errors are computed without correction for the noise contribution ; cosmic variance is not included .",
    "note that the wiener filters are more accurate , but the differences with the pseudo - inverse solutions decrease once corrections for noise are applied .",
    "this is particularly true for the hf set , where the noise level is higher .",
    "the total error on the cmb power spectrum @xmath143 turns out to be of the order of @xmath153 for both the channels sets , and decreases from lower to higher multipoles . in both cases",
    "the contribution of the errors in the estimation of the mixing matrix is subdominant .        , but for the hf set , at the reference frequency of 217 ghz.,width=226 ]",
    "the tests described here demonstrate that the correlated component analysis ( cca ) method ( bedini et al . 2005 ) , applied to simulated data with planck specifications , is a promising tool to estimate the mixing matrix parameterizing the frequency scaling of different astrophysical signals in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations . for the low frequency planck channels , from 30 to 143 ghz , and with the angular resolution of @xmath73 , the most accurate estimates are obtained in the latitude range @xmath154 $ ] , where the foregrounds we aim to recover are relatively strong .",
    "however , the strong concentration of intense free - free emission in a narrow strip ( a few degrees wide ) around the galactic equator introduces a large gradient of the global spectral index of galactic radio emission ( synchrotron plus free - free ) that prevents an accurate recovery of the synchrotron spectral index with the low resolution of the lf channels .",
    "the problem is cured cutting out the strip at @xmath155 . having done that , both the synchrotron and the dust spectral index are recovered with a mean absolute error of 0.05 . at higher latitudes , the mean error on the synchrotron index increases to 0.08 , while that on the dust index is unchanged .",
    "the situation is even better with the high frequency planck channels , from 217 to 545 ghz , thanks to the better spatial resolution ( @xmath74 ) and to the fact that the only relevant foreground , at least on intermediate angular scales , is galactic dust .",
    "we have shown that , exploiting non - optimized component separation techniques , such as wiener filter and pseudo - inverse filter , such errors allow us to estimate the cmb power spectrum with an uncertainty of the order of @xmath153 on the angular scales constrained by our patch size .",
    "we conclude that the cca can be a promising independent way to probe the spectral behaviour of the main foregrounds affecting the cmb",
    ". this second order statistical approach may allow us to increase our knowledge on foregrounds and to perform component separation with traditional non - blind methods with a minimum number of priors .",
