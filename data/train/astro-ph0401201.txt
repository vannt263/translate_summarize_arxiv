    "in the standard picture ( e.g.  ) subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are core helium burning stars on the extended horizontal branch ( ehb ) .",
    "they consist of a he core with a mass of @xmath00.48@xmath1 , the canonical mass for a he core flash on the first red giant branch ( rgb ) , and a thin , inert hydrogen shell .",
    "evolutionary models of ehb stars calculated by and adopted an enhanced mass loss on the rgb , however , without specifying a particular mechanism .",
    "recent radial velocity ( rv ) surveys revealed that a large fraction of all sdb stars resides in close binaries (; ; ) .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) performed a theoretical investigation of possible close binary channels for the formation of sdbs : stable roche lobe overflow , common envelope ejection , and merging of two he core white dwarf ( wds ) .",
    "they concluded that it is possible to explain _ all _ sdb stars as the result of close binary evolution .",
    "the helium - rich subdwarf o stars ( he - sdo ) are hotter than sdbs , but have similar surface gravities .",
    "their formation is still a mystery . in one scenario",
    "they are explained as an advanced stage of post - ehb evolution ( , ) .",
    "another scenario proposes the formation of he - sdos via a phase as extreme he stars after the merging of two he core wds ( cf .",
    "discussion in ) .",
    "spy , the eso * s*upernovae type ia * p*rogenitor surve*y * ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) , is a programme dedicated to search for short period binary wds ( double degenerates  dds ) .",
    "the aim of spy is the detection of dd progenitors of supernovae type ia by means of a survey for rv variations .",
    "snia progenitor candidates should be close enough to merge within one hubble time due to gravitational wave radiation and the combined mass should exceed the chandrasekhar limit for wds . the spy input catalogue collected wd candidates brighter than @xmath2 from a variety of source catalogues ( cf .  ) .",
    "the sdbs analyzed in this paper were selected from the hamburg / eso survey @xcite , the wd catalogue , and the hamburg quasar survey @xcite .    as a by - product ,",
    "spy produced high accuracy rv measurements of more than 46 sdb stars and 23 he - sdo stars , which were included in our sample because of misclassifications in the input catalogues .",
    "thus spy produces a large sample of known close binary sdb stars , offering an independent data set and allowing for a substantial improvement of the statistics .",
    "the he - sdo sample included in spy is the first he - sdo sample systematically checked for rv variations .",
    "this allows us to investigate the role of binarity for their formation and their possible link with the sdb stars .",
    "spy is carried out with the high - resolution spectrograph uves at the ut2 telescope of eso vlt . with our instrument setup",
    "we achieve nearly complete spectral coverage from 3200  to 6650with only two @xmath080   wide gaps .",
    "since spy was implemented as a bad weather program , we used a wide ( @xmath3 ) slit to minimize slit losses .",
    "the resulting spectral resolving power is @xmath4 ( 0.36  at h@xmath5 ) or better , if seeing disks were smaller than the slit width . due to the nature of the project ,",
    "two spectra at different `` random '' epochs separated by at least one day are observed ( cf .   , for details ) .",
    "the rv variations were measured differentially between both observed spectra with a cross correlation routine .",
    "this allowed to include all suitable lines ( h , he , and metal lines ) for the rv determination in a very flexible way .",
    "we routinely achieved a rv accuracy of 2km / s or better .",
    "rv variations could be checked for 46 single - lined sdbs from the complete spy sample ( , @xcite ) .",
    "their distribution in the temperature - gravity plane is displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : hr ] .",
    "our rv measurements yielded 18 rv variable binaries , i.e.  39% of this sample .",
    "this indicates a high fraction of close binaries in the spy sample , conforming the importance of binary channels for the formation of sdbs .",
    "however , somewhat surprisingly our result points to a lower fraction of detections than in the sample , who found 58% rv variable sdbs .    for a quantitative comparison with other samples and an evaluation of the true fraction of binaries one needs to know the detection efficiency , i.e.   the chance that a binary escaped detection , because of unfavorable inclination angles or phasing of the observations .",
    "the detection efficiency obviously depends on the orbital period and the mass of the unseen companion .",
    "we performed a monte carlo simulation of our observed sample for two different choices of the mass of the invisible companion : @xmath6 , the mass of a typical wd , and @xmath7 for a typical low mass main sequence star .",
    "for every star we calculated detection probabilities taking into account the timing of exposures and the rv accuracy .",
    "results for the sample were coadded yielding the effective sample size ( i.e.  the size of an equivalent sample with 100% binary detection rate ) plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : detection ] as function of orbital period .",
    "for an alternative interpretation we indicate the relative percentage of the detection rate .",
    "the detection probabilities are quite high for short period systems , exceeding 90% for systems with a wd companion and periods shorter than one day .",
    ".corrections for detection efficiency for the sdb and the he - sdo samples .",
    "calculations were done for the two distributions discussed in the text , the canonical sdb mass of @xmath8 , and different companion masses . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the very low number of close binaries in our he - sdo sample provides evidence that he - sdos , as a class , are not successors of ehb stars .",
    "formation of he - sdos by merging of two he core wds would be in agreement with our finding .    how do our sdb results compare with the binary population synthesis of ? @xcite produced several simulated samples of sdbs resulting from their binary evolution channels with different parameter choices and presented a best fit sample ( their simulation set  2 ) .",
    "they could reproduce the properties of observed sdb binaries ( from ) and the distribution in the temperature - gravity plane ( cf .  , @xcite ) .",
    "observational selection effects against sdbs with visible cool companions ( gk selection ) and against stars above the ehb ( strip selection ) were simulated .",
    "they predict an observable binary frequency for their best fit model of 45% ( the remainder resulting from merging ) , which compares well to our 40% , if we apply the same criteria to the spy sample",
    ".    however , two problems remain .",
    "simulated a population with thin disk characteristics , which should be representative for the sample , but this sample yielded a binary frequency of 69% . on the other hand predict a low binary frequency for stars above the ehb , because this region should contain many sdbs resulting from merging .",
    "although a systematic observational investigation of stars in this region has still to be done , it appears that the binary frequency in this region is higher than expected ( see fig .",
    "[ f : hr ] ) from the theoretical simulation .",
    "a further complication might arise if some or all of the mergers produce he - sdos , instead . in summary",
    "the new theoretical simulations represent the properties of the observed sdb sample well , but some unsolved problems remain .",
    "future investigations will help to decide , if these can be solved by minor adjustments or imply larger revisions .",
