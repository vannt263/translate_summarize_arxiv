    "the authors formed a panel at adass xxvi in trieste , italy on the evening of 17@xmath0 october 2016 for a birds of a feather session to look at `` operations in the era of large distributed telescopes '' .",
    "the suggested items to ve consider were as follows :    * experiences in the area of transitioning from construction to operations * integration of hpc environments ( usually located off - site ) into telescope operations and scheduling . *",
    "need for service level agreements * monitoring of system parts out of our control ( like networking ) * culture ( in international teams ) * scaling up to order of magnitudes larger number of observations * rfi ( which also scales with size ) * there is no driver for an archive because funding comes from people who write proposals . for those ,",
    "the archive is only a way to provide data to the pi . * acquiring funding for ( pure ) operations causing the use of r&d grants to acquire operational hardware or development , which is risky business .",
    "the aim was not to solve all these problems in the one session , but to provoke discussion .",
    "this paper gives a brief overview of the salient points of the discussion .",
    "* * monitoring of system parts out of our control . * + monitoring of parts that are out of the control of the operations teams is very hard to solve .",
    "the operations team need a good working relationship with the people on the ground ; the partners of the telescope . sometimes the operations teams notice more errors than the other partners own monitoring and you have to build up a trust relation .",
    "this is hard to build in to service level agreements ( sla ) . *",
    "* use case for commissioning are nt the same for operations . * + the use cases for commissioning are very different from the system that was designed .",
    "this is particular true for the automatic pipelines .",
    "+ in most cases the early science is not generated from an automatic pipeline .",
    "it is individuals running the various stages by hand . *",
    "* knowledge transfer . *",
    "+ transferring all the expertise in the engineering team to the operational team is very important , since it reduces possible down time . that transfer can take time .",
    "since the time line to get the instrument running is generally challenging , this process needs to be in place .",
    "when moving the telescope from development to operations , and doing early science , you are in a phase where you have an operational telescope while you are still changing the system .",
    "you want to minimise down time .",
    "* * integration of hpc environments into telescope operations and scheduling . * + hpc systems have to be integrated into the instrument .",
    "it does nt stop at the correlator .",
    "if the supercomputer goes down , you have to stop observing .",
    "the people who work in hpc centres have a different culture .",
    "they are used to work being submitted as batch jobs . if a system goes down , it is not a major issue as the jobs will restart .",
    "if data is being streamed into the hpc this is a major issue .",
    "the mandate of research hpc is to provide computing .",
    "however the type of usage for radio astronomy is very different to what they are used to .",
    "so the research hpc environments have to start thinking how to design their systems and operations to have redundancy so that you can have continuity of service and uptime . *",
    "* cloud computing . * + using cloud computing , one can not really trust they are future proof . storing terabytes of data",
    "has major cost implications .",
    "silly and simple mistakes in scripts can give , quite unintentional , very high bills .",
    "however experimenting with using the cloud gives the hpc centres a sense of competition and may actually give them an working examples of good slas that work in industry . * * need for strong service level agreements .",
    "* + you need the hpc facility running when data is arriving from the telescope .",
    "the hpc facility needs to work towards this which means the mandate must come from written service agreements signed by high - level people . * * issues with organisations to store data . *",
    "+ many of the organisations storing data for projects use infrastructure that is government funded . if the government reduces or removes the funding the data may well be lost .",
    "unfortunately long term archives have been an afterthought to most , but not all , major telescopes in the past decade . * * framework for running the pipelines . * + most astronomy work is not well suited to batch jobs .",
    "currently the most popular way of processing astronomy data is to define workflow components statically in scripts .",
    "these scripts are then either executed sequentially on a local machine or wrapped into job scripts submitted to job scheduling systems in an hpc environment .",
    "such application - driven workflow models have several drawbacks .",
    "firstly , maintainable ; secondly , the execution process lacks real - time monitoring and control ; and finally , even if failures or exceptions are noticed at an earlier stage users still have to restart the entire job for re - execution .",
    "* * culture ( in international teams ) . * + video and conference calls only go so far - face to face meetings are still necessary . face to face interaction is very important to understand each others needs and possibilities .",
    "this is not just for the scientists but includes the hpc support people .",
    "+ you may expect that other countries work the same way yours do .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "this can result in asking questions to the wrong people in the hierarchy for example , and delay a project . * * commercial companies do nt understand science requirements .",
    "cultural difference between what we and what they measure . *",
    "+ for the astronomy team it can be really annoying if we have 0.01% data loss . to a commercial company",
    "this might be perfectly acceptable .",
    "the telescope records data in real - time , and with data loss you get holes which grow larger after processing .",
    "* * do nt worry too much about the end product ; concentrate of what s next .",
    "* + many systems have spent to much time in analysing requirements , for the full system and have forgotten that there is a long road to go for the full system , and that the transition from construction to operation does nt follow a waterfall model .",
    "this is compounded by the face along the way , requirements have to change and resources have to be diverted to try and help the project going forward . *",
    "* coders having different objectives . *",
    "+ one of the main challenger has been to make the various groups of software developers to work together .",
    "they share different objectives ( developers want to create code as fast as possible , while operations want to have a stable system ) .",
    "they normally do not know each others requirements and constraints , especially when they are geographically distributed . * * maintenance * + one key issue in software management is software maintenance .",
    "one specific issue is software obsolescence .",
    "some telescopes have been running for over 50 years .",
    "the main problem is that you ca nt predict the funding of your telescope on the long run you do nt know whether investing in new software is worth it for a longer time .",
    "a pragmatic approach is that if support stops , change or upgrade software .",
    "so you have to make sure software keeps being upgradable .",
    "* * there is no driver for an archive because funding comes from people who write proposals . for those ,",
    "the archive is only a way to provide data to the pi . *",
    "+ meerkat integrated the archive as part of the commissioning phase .",
    "they had the pis interact with the archive staff and get involved in meta data extraction .",
    "+ lofar did nt suffer from an outdated design of the archive since the archive was nt designed in from the start .",
    "the focus was mostly on getting the instrument built .",
    "the archive should have been part of the commissioning of the instrument .",
    "this is especially important because when you see that for some telescopes , about half the scientific output comes from the archive .",
    "+ in alma , the data is now distributed to the regional centres .",
    "the commissioners have access to the local repository in chile .",
    "this may have been an issue in the beginning .",
    "alma was very modern in the sense that the archive was designed as a central part from the beginning .",
    "however it is generally underestimated how much work data management was , and alma was not an exception to that .",
    "the good news is that this seems to be developing .",
    "lsst is for example spending about half the budget to data management ."
