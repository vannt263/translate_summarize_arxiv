    "understanding the mechanisms of acoustic nonlinearity in heterogeneous materials is an object of intensive studies @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence has shown that media such as rocks and concrete possess an anomalously strong acoustic nonlinearity , which is of great importance for the description of ultrasonic phenomena including damage diagnostics .",
    "besides the widely - studied nonlinear and hysteretic stress - strain relation @xcite , a long - time relaxation is also reported by most of the authors @xcite . this slow dynamics",
    "is typically observed in experiments of softening / hardening @xcite , where a bar is forced by a monochromatic excitation on a time interval , before the source is switched - off . during the experiment , the elastic modulus is measured by dynamic acousto - elastic testing methods .",
    "it can be observed that the elastic modulus decreases gradually ( softening ) , and then it recovers progressively its initial value after the extinction of the source ( hardening ) .",
    "the time scales of each stage is much longer than the time scale of the forcing , which justifies the term `` slow dynamics '' .",
    "the modelling of this slow dynamic effect has been investigated by many authors . an essentially phenomenological model is widely used for this purpose : the preisach - mayergoyz model ( p - m model ) based on the integral action of hysteretic elements connecting stress and strain @xcite .",
    "this model initially arose from the theory of magnetism , where the `` hysteron '' has a clear physical significance . in elasticity",
    ", such a physical interpretation is not available . to overcome this limitation and to develop a rigorous theory ,",
    "various authors have proposed alternative models based on clear mechanical concepts . to our knowledge , the first physical model of slow dynamics",
    "was described in @xcite , where the relaxation was related to the recovery of microscopic contact impeded by a smooth spectrum of energy barriers .",
    "this theory was extended in @xcite , and recently improved based on the analysis of inter - grain contacts and the resulting surface force potential with a barrier @xcite .",
    "another approach was followed in @xcite , where the author shows that two rough surfaces interacting via adhesion forces yield dynamics similar to that of the fictitious elements of the preisach - mayergoyz space @xcite .    here , we present an alternative mechanical description of slow dynamics based on the works of vakhnenko and coauthors @xcite , where the following scenario is proposed :    * the young s modulus @xmath0 varies with time .",
    "one can write @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a time - dependent concentration of defects .",
    "it is closely related to the notion of damage in solids mechanics .",
    "but contrary to what happens in this irreversible case , where @xmath2 strictly increases with time , the evolution of @xmath2 is reversible .",
    "waiting a sufficiently long time , the initial material properties are recovered ; * at equilibrium , stress @xmath3 yields a concentration of defects @xmath4 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath3 is monotonic ; * out of equilibrium , relaxation times are required for @xmath2 to reach @xmath4 . whether @xmath5 ( increase in the number of defects ) or @xmath6 ( decrease in the number of defects ) , vakhnenko et al state that the time scales differ .",
    "the argument is given in section iii of @xcite : `` there are various ways for an already existing crack in equilibrium to be further expanded when surplus tensile load is applied .",
    "however , under compressive load a crack , once formed , has only one spatial way to be annhilated or contracted '' . in both cases ,",
    "these relaxation times are much longer than the time scale of the excitation , which explains the slow dynamics .    comparisons with experimental data are given in section v of @xcite , where the authors reproduced experiments done on berea sandstone @xcite .",
    "one current weakness is that no micro - mechanical description of the involved defects has been proposed so far .",
    "a possible analogy may be found with populations of open / closed cracks filled with air , equivalent to a population of bubbles that relax towards an equilibrium state , depending on the applied stress @xcite . in counterpart ,",
    "one attractive feature of vakhnenko s model is that it combines hyperbolic equations and relaxation terms , which constitutes a sound basis of physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the present paper is a contribution to the theoretical analysis of this model and to its practical implementation to describe wave motion in damaged media .",
    "first , we point out that no mechanisms prevents the concentration of defects from exceeding 1 , which is physically unrealistic .",
    "we fix this problem by proposing another expression for the equilibrium concentration .",
    "second , the stokes model describing viscoelasticity behaviour in @xcite poorly describes the attenuation in real media , and it is badly suited to time - domain simulations of wave propagation .",
    "instead , we propose a new nonlinear version of the zener model .",
    "this viscoelastic model degenerates correctly towards a pure nonlinear elasticity model when attenuation effects vanish .",
    "moreover , the usual zener model in the linear regime is recovered @xcite . in practice",
    ", this model only requires one physical parameter under the assumption of constant quality factor .",
    "third , hyperbolicity is analyzed .",
    "depending on the chosen model of nonlinear elasticity , a real sound speed may obtained only on a finite interval of strains ; this is true in particular with the widely - used landau s model .",
    "the main effort of vakhnenko et al was devoted to the construction of a model of slow dynamics .",
    "the resolution of the involved equations was quite rudimentary and not satisfying .",
    "indeed , the equilibrium concentration of defects @xmath4 was assumed to be known and was imposed ( eq ( 17 ) in @xcite ) , while it depends on @xmath3 . but",
    "treating the full coupled nonlinear equations is out of reach of a semi - analytical approach , which explains the strategy of these authors . on the contrary ,",
    "we propose here a numerical method to integrate the full system of equations , involving the nonlinear elasticity , the hysteretic terms of viscoelasticity , and the slow dynamics . due to the existence of different time scales ,",
    "a splitting strategy is followed , ensuring the optimal time step for integration .",
    "the full system is split into a propagative hyperbolic part ( resolved by a standard scheme for conservation laws ) and into a relaxed part ( resolved exactly ) .",
    "our numerical model is very modular .",
    "the various bricks ( nonlinear elasticity , viscoelasticity , slow dynamics ) can be incorporated easily .",
    "numerical tests validate each part separately . when all the whole bricks are put together , typical features of wave motion in damaged media",
    "are observed .",
    "the softening / hardening experiments are qualitatively reproduced .",
    "in this section , we write the basic components describing the wave motion in a 1d material with damage .",
    "the fundations rely on linear elastodynamics , whose equations are recalled in section [ secphyslin ] .",
    "then , the soft - ratchet model of vakhnenko and coauthors is introduced and enhanced in section [ secphyssoft ] .",
    "the fast dynamics is described in section [ secphyselasto ] , where various known models of nonlinear elasticity are presented , and a nonlinear model of viscoelasticity is proposed .",
    "this latter degenerates correctly in the limit cases of linear elasticity or null attenuation .      in the case of small deformations ,",
    "the propagation of 1d elastic waves can be described by the following system @xcite :    [ elastolin ] -=,[elastolin1 ] + [ 6pt ] -=0,[elastolin2 ]    where @xmath7 is the time , @xmath8 is the spatial coordinate , @xmath9 is a forcing term , @xmath10 is the displacement , @xmath11 is the velocity , @xmath12 is the strain , and @xmath3 is the stress .",
    "the latter is a function of strain : @xmath13 .    in the linear case",
    ", hooke s law writes @xmath14 , where @xmath0 is the young s modulus , which is assumed to be constant over time . in the particular case where @xmath9 is a dirac source at @xmath15 with time evolution @xmath16 ,",
    "then the exact solution of ( [ elastolin ] ) is straightforward @xmath17 where sgn is the sign distribution , and @xmath18 is the speed of sound .",
    "the goal of the forthcoming sections is to extend the model ( [ elastolin ] ) in three ways :    * time variations of @xmath0 due to the stress ; * nonlinear hooke s law ; * hereditary effects ( viscoelasticity ) .",
    "the time scales for the first effect ( variation of @xmath0 ) are much greater than for the second and third effect .",
    "this is consequently referred to as _",
    "slow dynamics_.      here we follow the approach taken from @xcite with some modifications .",
    "the slow dynamics of the medium is assumed to rely on the concentration of activated defects @xmath2 , which varies with @xmath3 . in the lowest approximation , the young s modulus",
    "is written : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the critical concentration of defects and the maximum possible value of young s modulus , respectively ( figure [ figyoung]-(a ) ) .",
    "the following constraints hold : @xmath22    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure [ figpsicel ] illustrates the properties of the viscoelastic model .",
    "figure [ figpsicel]-(a ) compares the reciprocal of the constant quality factor @xmath23 with the value deduced from ( [ qm1 ] ) , for @xmath24 and @xmath25 relaxation mechanisms .",
    "nonlinear optimization is performed from @xmath26 khz to @xmath27 khz .",
    "large oscillations are obtained for @xmath24 ; excellent agreement is observed for @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ figpsicel]-(b ) shows the increase in phase velocity from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for details about these quantities .",
    "lastly , the consistancy relation ( [ consistance ] ) is proven here .",
    "null attenuation amounts to an infinite quality factor .",
    "equation ( [ qm1 ] ) implies that @xmath30 is obtained if @xmath31 . in this case , the viscoelastic coefficients ( [ ervse ] ) and ( [ e1e2eta ] ) are @xmath32 to get a bounded stress , ( [ rheo3 ] ) implies @xmath33 , and hence @xmath34 for @xmath35 ( [ mailleeps ] ) .",
    "putting together the total stress ( [ maillesigma ] ) , the nonlinear elasticity ( [ elastonl ] ) and the homogeneity property in ( [ propelastonl ] ) , one obtains @xmath36 which concludes the proof .",
    "the jacobian @xmath37 of @xmath38 ( [ fluxfunc ] ) is @xmath39 where @xmath40 the determinant of @xmath37 writes @xmath41 the columns and lines are denoted by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the following algebraic manipulations are performed successively :    ( i ) : :    @xmath44 , ( ii ) : :    @xmath45 , with    @xmath46 ,    which yields @xmath47 it follows that the eigenvalues are 0 ( with multiplicity @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 , with the sound velocity ( [ c2 ] ) . from ( [ phi ] ) , real eigenvalues are obtained if and only if @xmath50 in ( [ c2 ] ) .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions are easily deduced from ( [ c2 ] ) for the models ( [ model1])-([model3 ] ) when @xmath51 : hyperbolicity is satisfied if @xmath52 , where @xmath53 model 2 is always hyperbolic . on the contrary ,",
    "the widely - used landau model ( model 3 ) is conditionally hyperbolic . when @xmath54 , the hyperbolicity condition @xmath55 is sufficient .",
    "given the nonlinear elastic models ( [ model1])-([model3 ] ) , the speed of sound @xmath56 satisfies : @xmath57",
    "for linear stress - strain relations ( [ rheo ] ) , the relaxation coefficients ( [ deltal ] ) yield @xmath58 \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial \\delta_\\ell}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{1\\ell}}(0)=-\\frac{1}{\\eta_\\ell}\\left(\\sigma^{'}_{1\\ell}(0)+\\sigma^{'}_{2\\ell}(0)\\right)=-\\frac{1}{\\eta_\\ell}\\left(k_{1\\ell}+k_{2\\ell}\\right ) . \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the jacobian matrix of the relaxation function ( [ fluxfunc ] ) can be obtained @xmath59 with @xmath60 if @xmath6 , @xmath61 if @xmath5 , @xmath62 else .",
    "it follows that the eigenvalues are 0 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the semi - analytical solution of the viscodynamic equations is computed as follows .",
    "fourier transforms in space and time are applied to the system ( [ edpvisco ] ) . applying an inverse fourier",
    "transform in space yields @xmath65 where the hat refers to the fourier transform , @xmath66 is the time evolution of the source , the relaxation times @xmath67 and @xmath68 are defined in ( [ taueta ] ) , and @xmath69 is the wavenumber .",
    "the poles @xmath70 satisfy @xmath71 with @xmath72 . applying the residue theorem",
    "gives the time - domain velocity @xmath73 expressions for @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be obtained in a similar manner .",
    "lastly , the numerical evaluation of ( [ fourierinv ] ) is done using a rectangular quadrature rule on @xmath76 fourier modes and with a constant frequency step @xmath77 on the frequency band of interest ."
