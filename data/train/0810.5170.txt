    "[ sec : main - results ]      [ sec : intro ]    the main theme of this paper is the interplay between two aspects of the dynamics of hamiltonian systems : the existence of periodic orbits of arbitrarily large period ( or just of infinitely many periodic orbits ) and the behavior of the action or ( mean ) index spectrum under iterations .    when the manifold is closed and symplectically aspherical , this interplay is fairly unambiguous and can , for instance , be described as follows . on the one hand , as is proved in @xcite , the minimal positive action - index gap remains bounded for a certain sequence of iterations , and therefore the action - index spectrum `` grows '' with iteration .",
    "on the other hand , every hamiltonian system on such a manifold has infinitely many periodic orbits ( see section [ sec : conley ] ) and this fact can easily be inferred from the boundedness of the action - index gap ; @xcite .",
    "in fact , all symplectic topological proofs of the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits rely on the analysis of the action or index spectrum ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , once the manifold is not assumed to be symplectically aspherical , the question becomes considerably more involved .",
    "the first reason for this is that a hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a closed manifold need not have infinitely many periodic orbits .",
    "the second reason is that , since in general the action and index depend on the choice of capping of an orbit , the task of extracting information about the number or growth of the number of orbits from the spectrum becomes much more difficult .",
    "here we address the following two questions :    * under what conditions on the manifold and/or the action or index spectrum , a hamiltonian diffeomorphism has infinitely many ( or just many ) periodic orbits ? * what are the special features of the action or index spectrum of a hamiltonian diffeomorphism with only finitely many periodic orbits ?    these two questions ,",
    "although formally equivalent , represent two very different , virtually opposite perspectives focusing on mutually complementary classes of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms .    the main results of the paper are stated and discussed in detail in sections [ sec : conley][sec : sdm ] and the organization of the paper is outlined in section [ sec : org ] .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ sec : prelim ] for necessary definitions and further references .      as we understand it today",
    ", the conley conjecture asserts the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for any hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath2 of a closed , symplectically aspherical manifold @xmath3 or , more precisely , the existence of periodic points of arbitrarily large period , provided that the fixed points are isolated .",
    "this conjecture was proved for the so - called weakly non - degenerate hamiltonian diffeomorphisms in @xcite and for all hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of surfaces , other than @xmath4 , in @xcite . in its original form ,",
    "as stated in @xcite for @xmath5 , the conjecture was established in @xcite and , finally , the case of an arbitrary closed , symplectically aspherical manifold was settled in @xcite .",
    "( see also , e.g. , @xcite for other related results . )",
    "the first theorem of this paper , proved in section [ sec : conley - pfs ] , is an extension of the conley conjecture to rational symplectic manifolds with @xmath6 .",
    "[ thm : conley ] let @xmath2 be a hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a closed , rational symplectic manifold @xmath7 with @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath2 has simple periodic orbits of arbitrarily large period whenever the fixed points of @xmath2 are isolated .",
    "the conley conjecture obviously fails unless the symplectic manifold ( or the diffeomorphism ) meets additional requirements such as the condition @xmath6 in theorem [ thm : conley ] .",
    "for instance , the rotation of @xmath4 in an irrational angle has only two periodic orbits .",
    "( both of these orbits are fixed points of the rotation ) .",
    "more generally , we have    [ exam : torus - action ] let @xmath3 admit a hamiltonian torus action with isolated fixed points ; see , e.g. , @xcite for the definition and further details .",
    "then a generic element of the torus generates a hamiltonian diffeomorphism of @xmath3 with finitely many periodic orbits and these orbits are the fixed points of the action . within this class of manifolds @xmath3",
    "are , for instance , the majority of coadjoint orbits of compact lie groups . as an explicit example of this type , consider the hamiltonian @xmath8 on @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath9 generates a circle action with isolated fixed points , provided that the eigenvalues @xmath10 are rationally independent , i.e. , linearly independent over @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath3 is as above , the equivariant blow - up of @xmath3 at the fixed points inherits a hamiltonian torus action and this action also has , in many instances , isolated fixed points .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the minimal chern number of @xmath3 ; see section [ sec : conv ] .",
    "the following result , also established in section [ sec : conley - pfs ] , is of interest when @xmath12 is large .",
    "[ thm : n / n ] let @xmath13 be a closed , rational , weakly monotone manifold with @xmath14 .",
    "then any hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath2 of @xmath3 has at least @xmath15 geometrically distinct periodic orbits .    for instance ,",
    "if @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath16 , the theorem asserts the existence of infinitely many geometrically distinct periodic points , which also follows from theorem [ thm : conley ] .    to put theorem [ thm : n / n ] in context , note that as has been hypothesized by michael chance and dusa mcduff , the conley conjecture may hold for closed manifolds with sufficiently many gromov ",
    "witten invariants equal to zero .",
    "for instance , one might expect the conley conjecture to be true , when @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 and @xmath3 is negative monotone ) , and hence the quantum product coincides with the cup product ; see example [ ex : quantum = cup ] .",
    "theorems [ thm : conley ] and [ thm : n / n ] can be viewed as a step toward proving this generalization of the conley conjecture .",
    "note that the manifolds from example [ exam : torus - action ] , for which the conley conjecture fails , tend to have a large number of non - zero gromov ",
    "witten invariants ( see @xcite ) and also have @xmath19 in all known examples . among the manifolds satisfying the hypotheses of theorem [ thm : conley ] are calabi ",
    "yau manifolds .",
    "there are also numerous examples of weakly monotone , rational manifolds with large @xmath20 , though none of these manifolds are monotone ; see example [ ex : quantum = cup ] .      as was pointed out in section [ sec : intro ] , all symplectic geometrical approaches to proving the conley conjecture type results , such as theorems [ thm : conley ] and [ thm : n / n ] , rely on the analysis of the sets of actions or indices of periodic orbits ( the so - called action and mean index spectra ) . from this perspective",
    ", the conley conjecture is quite similar to the degenerate case of the arnold conjecture ( see section [ sec : ls ] ) and differs significantly from the non - degenerate arnold conjecture whose proof utilizes a direct count of periodic orbits via floer homology .",
    "furthermore , extending the proof of the conley conjecture beyond the case of a symplectically aspherical manifold encounters the same difficulty as the proof of the degenerate arnold conjecture  differentiating between geometrically distinct orbits and recappings of the same orbit .    the most naive approach to utilizing the action and mean index spectra in proving the conley conjecture and related results amounts to showing that these spectra , modulo the rationality constant @xmath21 or modulo @xmath22 , change with iterations .",
    "arguments of this type are discussed in more detail in section [ sec : conley - pfs ] . in this section , following @xcite , we describe a different way of relating the properties of the action and mean index spectra to the dynamics of @xmath2 .",
    "to state the main result , we need to introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath9 be a one - periodic in time hamiltonian on @xmath3 .",
    "then , @xmath9 can also be viewed as a @xmath23-periodic hamiltonian and in this case is denoted by @xmath24 and referred to as the @xmath23th iteration of @xmath9 .",
    "likewise , the @xmath23th iteration of a capped periodic orbit @xmath25 is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the periodic orbits @xmath25 and @xmath27 of @xmath9 are said to be geometrically distinct when the periodic orbits through @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath30 generated by @xmath9 are geometrically distinct .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the action and , respectively , the mean index of @xmath9 on a @xmath23-periodic orbit @xmath27 .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ sec : prelim ] for a detailed discussion of these notions .",
    "the action gap between two @xmath23-periodic orbits @xmath25 and @xmath27 of @xmath9 is then the difference @xmath33 and the mean index gap is defined similarly as the difference @xmath34 . note that with these definitions , the action or mean index gap can be zero even when @xmath25 and @xmath27 are geometrically distinct .",
    "the action ",
    "index gap between @xmath25 and @xmath27 is simply the vector in @xmath35 whose components are the action and the mean index gaps .",
    "let also @xmath36 denote the hofer norm of @xmath9 ; see section [ sec : prelim ] . finally , recall that an increasing ( infinite ) sequence of integers @xmath37 is quasi - arithmetic if @xmath38 is bounded from above by a constant independent of @xmath39 .",
    "[ thm : gap1 ] let @xmath9 be a hamiltonian on a closed symplectic manifold @xmath7 such that all periodic orbits of @xmath30 are isolated .",

    "the rationality assumption on @xmath3 can be omitted in ( ii ) when @xmath9 is weakly non - degenerate .",
    "furthermore , regarding the role of the condition that all periodic orbits of @xmath9 are isolated , note that the theorem holds trivially without any assumptions on @xmath3 or @xmath9 once this is not the case , i.e. , @xmath9 has infinitely many @xmath23-periodic orbits for some @xmath23 . observe also that requirement ( i ) is automatically satisfied when @xmath48 , e.g. , when @xmath3 is symplectically aspherical .",

    "this is no longer the case when @xmath3 is not symplectically aspherical ; see section [ sec : gap - conley ] .",
    "however , theorem [ thm : gap1 ] and theorem [ thm : gap2 ] stated below do have an application within the realm of the conley conjecture , discussed in section [ sec : augm - action ] .",
    "theorem [ thm : gap1 ] concerns the situation when the quantum aspects of the symplectic topology of @xmath3 can be neglected . for instance",
    ", this is manifested by the fact that , as has been mentioned above , the quantum product coincides with the cup product when @xmath17 or by the results from @xcite when @xmath49 .    in the other extreme case ",

    "the fact that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are indeed geometrically distinct readily follows from and ; see the proof of theorem [ thm : gap2 ] .    the homological condition , , imposes a strong restriction on the symplectic topology of @xmath3 , even without the additional requirement of ( a ) or ( b ) , and implies , for instance , that @xmath3 is strongly uniruled in the sense of @xcite .",

    "although the statement of the theorem is certainly new , the proof follows a well - familiar path .",
    "on the conceptual level , the argument goes back to the original work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where the main underlying principle that the presence of a large space of holomorphic spheres forces the existence of periodic orbits with certain action bounds is established .",
    "our proof of the theorem relies on the technique of action selectors , developed in @xcite , and on the hamiltonian version of the ljusternik  schnirelman theory ( rather than on an explicit use of holomorphic spheres ) and bears a resemblance to many an argument found in , e.g. , @xcite and in @xcite . for @xmath80 , the theorem ( with different action and index bounds )",

    "it is clear that @xmath84 , referred to as the _ augmented action _ in what follows , is independent of the capping .",

    "the main advantage of using the mean index is that @xmath84 is defined even when @xmath82 is degenerate and that the augmented action is homogeneous , i.e. , @xmath85 since @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "thus , in the setting of theorem [ thm : cpn ] , every periodic orbit @xmath97 is one - periodic . on the other hand , hypothetically , every hamiltonian on @xmath0 with more than @xmath1 one - periodic orbits necessarily has infinitely many geometrically distinct periodic orbits .",

    "the key to realizing this idea is a geometrical characterization of symplectically non - degenerate maxima , building on the results of @xcite .",
    "namely , we show that a hamiltonian diffeomorphism @xmath30 with a symplectically degenerate maximum @xmath25 can be generated by a hamiltonian @xmath148 with a strict local maximum at @xmath391 , for all times , and with arbitrarily small hessian at @xmath386 ; see proposition [ def : sympl - deg ] .",
