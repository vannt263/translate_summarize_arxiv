    "several important problems arising in physics and engineering lead to consider boundary - value problems in domains with oscillating boundaries , such as flows over rough walls , electromagnetic waves in a region containing a rough interface @xcite , or heat transmission in winglets @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the poisson equation with neumann boundary conditions , arising from the study of stead state of reaction - diffusion flow over a thin bar with a rough boundary @xcite .",
    "the aim of our study is to derive precise estimates for the effective behavior of the solutions of such problem .    in order to setup the problem ,",
    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath2-periodic positive function .",
    "given a small parameter @xmath3 , let us consider the family of two - dimensional domains @xmath4 we restrict our attention to the solutions @xmath5 of the family of elliptic equations @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the unit outward normal vector field to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a non - homogeneous term in @xmath10 uniformly bounded .",
    "[ thin - domain ]    many authors have devoted efforts in the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of a similar equation in related domains , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption is that the scale of wavelength of the roughness is small compared with the roughness amplitude .",
    "therefore it is important to emphasize that the amplitude and period of the oscillations of @xmath11 are of the same order @xmath12 , which also coincides with the order of thickness of the thin domain .",
    "this scaling makes the problem very resonant and the determination of the limiting problem ( @xmath13 ) is not straightforward .",
    "it makes our analysis and results different from those papers .",
    "going back to problem , in @xcite the authors combine methods from _ homogenization theory _",
    ", specially those related to reticulated structures , to obtain the limiting behavior of the family of solutions @xmath5 .",
    "we recall that the convergence obtained in @xcite is with respect to the weak topology of the sobolev space @xmath14 . as pointed in @xcite , this convergence is the best one in these spaces .",
    "in general , one can not expect strong convergence in homogenization related problems .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a general introduction to the theory of homogenization and to @xcite for a general treatise on reticulated structures .    in such problems , where the analytical solution demands a substantial effort or is unknown , it is of interest in discussing error estimates ( in norm ) when we replace it with numerical approximations .    in this work we made use of an appropriate _ corrector _ approach developed by bensoussan , lions and papanicolaou in @xcite to derive a kind of strong convergence and error estimates in @xmath14-norm .",
    "this can be summarized as :    _ suppose @xmath15 weakly in @xmath16 in a sense to be defined .",
    "it is possible to find an explicit corrector term @xmath17 , @xmath18 in @xmath19 , in order to _",
    "@xmath20 for @xmath0 small enough .",
    "the reader is invited to @xcite for a classical introduction to correctors approach , @xcite for further discussion on approximations of arbitrary order for related problems , and @xcite for recent works in this subject as well .",
    "still related with the limiting behavior of problems in thin domains but in connection with continuity properties of global attractors associated to parabolic problems , we can cite @xcite and their references .",
    "finally , we would like to observe that although we just treat the neumann problem for the poisson equation , we may also consider different conditions in the lateral boundaries of the thin domain @xmath11 , while preserving the neumann type boundary condition in the upper and lower boundary .",
    "the limiting problem preserves the boundary condition .",
    "note that dirichlet boundary condition in the upper and lower boundaries is a trivial case since the trace operator is continuous on the set @xmath21 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ pre ] , we introduce the functional setting for the perturbed problem and the limiting one . in section [ msm ] ,",
    "we provide formal computations to derive the homogenized problem by the multiple - scale method . in section [ sec : fir - corr ] , we obtain convergence in @xmath14-norms for the first - order corrector , and in section [ ee ] , we use the second - order corrector to obtain rates of convergence for the first order approximation .",
    "we emphasize the relevance of these rates for numerical approximations of solutions of partial differential equations in highly heterogeneous and porous media .",
    "we stress for the fact that @xmath11 varies in accordance with a positive parameter @xmath12 and , when @xmath12 goes to @xmath22 , the domains @xmath11 collapse themselves to the interval @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in order to preserve the `` relative capacity '' of a mensurable subset @xmath24 , we rescale the lebesgue measure by @xmath25 , dealing with the singular measure @xmath26 this measure has been considered in studies involving thin domains , e.g. @xcite , and allows us introduce the lebesgue @xmath27 and the sobolev @xmath28 spaces .",
    "the norms in these spaces will be denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , being induced by the inner products @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "notice that the @xmath33 - norms and the usual ones in @xmath19 and @xmath16 are equivalents and easily related by @xmath34    the variational formulation of ( [ p ] ) is : find @xmath35 such that @xmath36 which is equivalent to find @xmath37 such that @xmath38 observe that the solutions @xmath5 satisfy a priori estimates uniformly with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we can take @xmath39 in ( [ vfp ] ) and ( [ eq : vfor ] ) to obtain @xmath40    in order to capture the limiting behavior of @xmath41 as @xmath42 , we consider the sesquilinear form @xmath43 in @xmath44 given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the average of function @xmath47 on the interval @xmath48 .",
    "we also will consider @xmath49 endowed with the norm induced by the inner product @xmath50 , given by @xmath51",
    "in this section we proceed as in @xcite . we suppose for a moment @xmath52 for all @xmath3 and @xmath53 .",
    "then we use the multiple - scale method to introduce formally the _ homogenized equation _ and the _ second - order expansion _ to the solutions @xmath35 of problem .",
    "we seek for a formal asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath54 the variables @xmath55 and @xmath56 represent the  macroscopic \" scale on the model , while @xmath57 and @xmath58 represent the  microscopic \" effect of the oscillating phenomena on the thin domain .",
    "the fact that @xmath11 degenerates to a line segment when @xmath12 goes to @xmath22 suggests that the solutions @xmath5 will not depend on the  macroscopic \" variable @xmath56 .",
    "this is taken into account in the choice of @xmath59 assuming that @xmath59 does not depend on the macroscopic variable @xmath56 .    in order to construct the functions @xmath59 of , motivated by the periodic nature of @xmath11",
    ", we consider the basic cell @xmath60 we decompose @xmath61 in the lateral part of the boundary @xmath62 , the upper part of the boundary @xmath63 and the lower part of the boundary @xmath64 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath65 is a @xmath2-periodic function in the variable @xmath66 ( ie .",
    "@xmath67 ) which is defined for all @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    performing the change of variables @xmath70 , @xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath72 , we obtain that @xmath73 observing from the geometry of @xmath11 that the unit outward normal vectors to @xmath8 and to @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively are related by @xmath77 one can see by replacing the expansion in the problem , after equate powers of @xmath12 , that the differential equations for the functions @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are as follows : for @xmath78 @xmath81 which implies that @xmath78 has to be constant with respect to variables @xmath82 , ie , @xmath83    concerning @xmath79 , we have @xmath84 since @xmath85 , denoting by @xmath86 the unique solution ( up to a constant ) of @xmath87 we get @xmath88    for @xmath80 , the boundary value problem is @xmath89 or , equivalently , upon using the expression for @xmath79 in , @xmath90    these problems are second order partial differential equations in the variables @xmath69 , with @xmath91 playing the role of a parameter .    next , by fredholm alternative we can derive the limiting problem for @xmath78 . indeed , if we take test functions @xmath92 in ( [ ems ] ) , we get @xmath93    on the other hand , by the divergence s theorem and ( [ ems ] ) , @xmath94 therefore replacing this expression in ( [ ems1 ] ) , we reach @xmath95 since @xmath96 depends only on @xmath66 and @xmath97 , we can conclude that @xmath78 must satisfy @xmath98 where @xmath99    the second order differential equation @xmath100 with the constant coefficient @xmath101 is called the homogenized equation of problem @xmath102 with the homogenized coefficient @xmath101 .",
    "now we use the homogenized equation to describe @xmath80 .",
    "we rewrite problem ( [ ems ] ) as @xmath103 the linearity of together with the fact that @xmath104 does not depend on the variables @xmath66 and @xmath97 suggest that we look for @xmath105 of the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the solution of the auxiliary problem @xmath108 then , we can use ( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ w2 ] ) to introduce the following asymptotic expansion for : @xmath109 this expansion will play an essential role in section [ ee ] below .",
