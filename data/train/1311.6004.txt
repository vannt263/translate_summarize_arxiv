    "even though the thermal history of the universe is properly described by the homogeneous and isotropic robertson - walker cosmological model @xcite , up to the very early stage of its evolution , reliably since the inflationary phase has been completed , the nature of the cosmological singularity is a general property of the einsteinian dynamics , suggesting the necessity of relaxing the high symmetry of the geometry that characterizes the big - bang .",
    "a very valuable insight on dynamical behaviors more general than the simple isotropic case , especially in view of the classical features of the initial singularity and of its quantum ones , is offered by the bianchi type ix model@xcite-@xcite , essentially for the following three reasons : i ) this model is homogeneous , but its dynamics possesses the same degree of generality as any generic inhomogeneous model ii ) the canonical quantization of this model can be performed via a minisuperspace approach , which reduces the asymptotic evolution near the singularity to the well - defined paradigm of the particle in a box iii ) the late ( classical ) evolution of the model is naturally reconcilied , with or without the inflation@xcite@xcite , to that of a closed isotropic universe@xcite .",
    "two years after the derivation of the wheeler - dewitt equation , c.w.misner applied this canonical quantization approach to the bianchi ix model , which , in the hamiltonian version he had just provided ( restating the oscillatory regime derived by belinski - khalatnikov - lifshitz ) , constitutes a proper application .",
    "the main result of the misner quantum analysis of the bianchi ix dynamics is to provide a brilliant demonstration of the phenomenon for which very high occupation numbers are preserved in the evolution towards the cosmological singularity .",
    "this result is achieved by using the chaotic properties of the classical bianchi ix dynamics ( the mixmaster model ) and by approximating the potential well , in which the universe - particle moves , by a simple square box , instead of the equilateral triangle it indeed is .",
    "many subsequent studies have been pursued on such a quantum dynamics , both in the misner variables @xcite , as well as in other frameworks ( as the misner - chitr scheme@xcite,@xcite ) , but the original semiclassical nature of the cosmological singularity , when considered in terms of high occupation numbers , still remains the most striking prediction of the canonical quantum dynamics provided by the mixmaster model .    in the misner variables , the dynamical problem is reduced to a two - dimensional scheme , in which the role of the time variable is played by the universe volume , while the two physical degrees of freedom are represented via the universe anisotropies .",
    "such a picture is elucidated by an adm ( arnowitt - deser - misner @xcite ) reduction of the variational principle ( based on the solution of the superhamiltonian constraint ) , but its physical significance emerges in a very transparent way , already in the direct hamiltonian approach to the dynamics .    here , we address the quantum analysis of the bianchi ix model by using the superhamiltonian constraint , which , via the dirac prescription , leads to the wheleer - dewitt equation ; this procedure is expectedly fully consistent with the schrdinger - like dynamics following from the adm reduction of the dirac constraint .",
    "the new feature we introduce by the present study is the discrete nature of the anisotropic degrees of freedom , by a two - dimensional quantization approach , based on the so - called _ polymer representation of quantum mechanics_. the use of such a modified quantization scheme is justified by the request that a cut - off in the spatial scale , as expected at the planckian level , would induce a corresponding discrete morphology in the configuration space .",
    "the reason for retaining the isotropic misner variables , connected to the universe volume , as a continuous ones , relies on the role time plays in the dynamical scheme .    this way",
    ", we discuss first the semiclassical behavior of the model , to be regarded to as the zero@xmath0-order approximation of a wkb expansion of the full quantum theory . by other words ,",
    "we analyze the classical behavior of a modified hamiltonian dynamics of the mixmaster model , based on the prescriptions fixed by the classical limit of the new paradigm . in this respect ,",
    "we remark that the typical scale of the polymer discretization is not directly related to the value of @xmath1 ; the classical limit for this quantity approaching zero still constitutes a modification of the einsteinian classical dynamics .",
    "such a semiclassical study is relevant to the interpretation of the full quantum behavior of the system , especially for the analysis of localized wave packets .",
    "the main result of this semiclassical analysis is the demonstration that the chaotic structure of the asymptotic evolution of the bianchi ix model to the cosmological singularity is naturally removed by a dynamical mechanism very similar to the one induced on the same dynamics by the introduction of a free massless scalar field . in the limit of small values of the polymer lattice parameter",
    ", we calculate the modified reflection law for the point - universe against the potential walls , which are due to the spatial curvature . for the general case",
    ", we provide a precise description of how the bounce against these walls is avoided and of the condition that the free - motion parameters of the model must satisfy for it to take place .",
    "the absence of chaos in the semiclassical behavior of the polymer mixmaster model prevents us from directly implementing the misner procedure , which is basic to its description of the states approaching the singularity with very high occupation numbers . we are therefore lead to analyze separately two cases : one in which the potential walls can be neglected in the quantum evolution , such that we deal with free - particle wave packets , and one in which when the potential walls play the role of a box , in which the point - universe is confined . in both cases ,",
    "the behavior of localized wave packets is analyzed to better understand the limit up to which the misner semiclassical feature survives in this modified approach .",
    "the main outcome we develop here is to identify how the presence of the walls is , sooner or later , relevant for the wave packets evolution , such that also the states with high occupation numbers are accordingly obliged to spread close enough to the singularity , simply because the potential box destroys their semiclassical nature .",
    "the direct comparison with the misner result is not possible because of the semiclassical behavior of the model , but the conclusion of our analysis is otherwise very clear , because there is no chance to built up a localized state that can reach the singularity without bouncing against the potential walls .",
    "this is because the conditions to fix a direction in the configuration space , which would allow for a free motion , is indeed time dependent and is , sooner or later , violated during the evolution of the wave packets . in this scheme ,",
    "there is no possibility to retain the semiclassical features in the quantum description , and we can therefore claim that the singularity of the mixmaster universe , as viewed in the present polymer representation , can not be described by semiclassical notion , as for the einsteinian oscillatory regime of the expanding and contracting independent directions , and that even its quantum relic , i.e. the occurrence of high occupation numbers close to the singular point , is removed in a discrete quantum picture for the anisotropy degrees of freedom .",
    "the relevance of this result is enforced by observing that , as investigated in @xcite , an oscillatory regime can not exist before a real classical limit of the universe is reached . as a consequence , since a simple model for the cut - off physics is able to cancel also the memory of semiclassical features in the planck era ( as misner argued in @xcite ) , we are lead to believe that the classical mixmaster dynamics is not fully compatible with the quantum origin of the universe , and it is indeed a classical dynamical regime reached by the system when the quantum effects are very small and the physical and configuration spaces appear as bounded by continuous domains .",
    "a certain specific interest for the implementation of a polymer approach to the quantum dynamics of the universe was rised by the analogy of this quantum prescription to the main issues of loop quantum cosmology , which , in the minisuperspace , essentially reduces to a polymer treatment of the ashtekar - barbero - immirzi variables , as adapted to the cosmological setting@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the first loop quantum cosmological analysis of the bianchi ix model was provided in @xcite , where it was argued the non - chaotic nature of the semiclassical dynamics .",
    "the main reason of such non - chaotic behavior of the bianchi ix model must be determined in the discrete nature of the universe volume and , in particular in its minimal ( cut - off ) value .",
    "in fact , asymptotically to the singularity , the potential walls can no longer arbitrarily growth and the point - universe confinement is removed .",
    "this analysis was based on the so - called inverse volume corrections and properly accounts for the induced semiclassical implications of the loop quantum gravity theory .",
    "nonetheless , the considered approach is based on a regularization scheme ( the so called @xmath2 one ) that is under revision , in order to provide a consistent reformulation of the bianchi ix dynamics as done in @xcite for the the isotropic robertson - walker geometry ( the @xmath3 regularization scheme ) .    a step in this direction",
    "has be pursued in @xcite , where the loop quantum dynamics is rigorously restated by adopting the @xmath3 regularization scheme , demostrating that , under certain circumstances , the chaotic features of the bianchi ix model are removed again .",
    "however , this result holds only when the quantum picture includes a massless scalar field , able to remove the chaoticity even on a classical einsteinian level .",
    "the reason of this striking difference in the two result obtained in these two approaches , must be individualized in the kind of semiclassical corrections discussed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this analysis only the so - called holonomy correction contributions are considered and they are unable to induce on the dynamics the basic feature of a volume cut - off scale .",
    "it is just this different type of quantum corrections adopted to construct the semiclassical limit , the reliable source of the non - generic nature of the chaoticity removal .",
    "althought it is expected that inverse volume corrections can remove the chaotic behavior of the bianchi ix model as in @xcite , nevertheless this has not been explicitly demonstrated and it stands as a mere conjecture .",
    "it is worth noting that a critical revision of the loop quantum cosmology picture of the primordial universe space , was presented in @xcite , where the necessity of a gauge fixing in implementing the homogeneity constraint is required .",
    "a consistent quantum reformulation of the dynamics of an homogeneous model was then constructed in @xcite , which allows a semiclassical limit of the theory , in close analogy to the full loop quantum gravity theory .    despite the polymer formulation of the canonical approach to the minisuperspace mimics",
    "very well some features of the loop quantum cosmology methodology ( de facto a polymer treatment of the restricted ashtekar - barbero - immirzi variables for the homogeneity constraint ) , however , there is a crucial difference between our result and such recent loop - like approaches .",
    "in fact , we apply the polymer procedure to the anisotropic variables only ( the real degrees of freedom of the cosmological gravitational field ) , leaving the universe volume at all unaffected by the cut - off physics , in view of its time - like behavior .",
    "the removal of the chaos , discussed here , is therefore not related to the volume discretization and it is also difficult to characterize its relation with the holonomy correction approach ( studying properties of the edge morphology more than of the nodes , but non - directly reducible to the anysotropy concept ) . in this respect ,",
    "the present result must be regarded as essentially an independent one with respect to the ones actually available in loop quantum cosmology . + this paper is organized as follows .",
    "+ in section [ pqm ] , we introduce the polymer representation of quantum mechanics , by a kynematical and a dynamical point of view .",
    "then we analyze the continuum limit and conclude the section illustrating two fundamental examples of one - dimensional systems : the polymer free particle and the particle in a box . + in section [ mix ] , we review the principal ( classical and quantum ) features of the mixmaster model , as studied by misner in@xcite . + section [ semi ] is dedicated to the study of the polymer mixmaster model , from a semi - classical point of view . in particular , we analyze the modified relational motion between the universe - particle and the walls , and we derive a modified reflection law for one single bounce against the wall . + in section [ quantum ] , we build up the wave packets for the case when the wave function of the universe is related to a free polymer particle and to a polymer particle in a square box , respectively . + finally , section [ num ] is devoted to the numerical integrations of the polymer wave packets and to the analysis on the quantum numbers related to the anisotropy .",
    "+ concluding remarks complete the paper .",
    "to apply the modified polymer approach to the mixmaster quantum dynamics , we briefly summarize the fundamental features of this modified quantization scheme . in particular ,",
    "after giving a general picture of the model , we consider the two specific cases of the free particle and of the particle in a box , which are relevant for the subseguent cosmological study .",
    "the polymer representation of quantum mechanics is a non - equivalent representation of the usual schrdinger quantum mechanics , based on a different kind of canonical commutation rules ( ccr ) .",

    "the mixmaster model , interpreted as the most general dynamics allowed by the homogeneity constraint , constitutes a valuable prototype of the behavior of a generic inhomogeneous model near the cosmological singularity , when referred to sufficiently small space regions , having roughly the causal size .",
    "the present work is aimed at generalizing @xcite , in which the classical mixmaster hamiltonian dynamics is reduced to the motion of a two - dimensional point - particle in a closed triangular - like potential and the corresponding quantum behavior is reconducted to the one of a point - particle in a box .",
    "the main result of the classical picture is the neverending bouncing of the particle against the potential walls ( resulting into a chaotic evolution ) , while , in the quantum regime , the surprising feature emerges , of states having very high occupation numbers which can approach the initial singularity .",
    "this generalization is the reformulation of the quantum mixmaster dynamics in the polymer quantum approach .",
    "we have applied this procedure to the physical degrees only , i.e. the universe anisotropies , while the universe volume has been kept in its standard interpretation as a time variable for the system evolution .",
    "the semi - classical behavior of the mixmaster model , i.e. the classical modified dynamics by means of the polymer features , results as chaos - free , in formal analogy with the case in which a massless scalar field is introduced in the einsteinian dynamics . as a consequence ,",
    "the quantum regime loses its property to admit very high occupation numbers asimptotically to the singularity .",
    "actually , we demonstrated that the absence of a chaotic behavior prevents to construct the classical constant of the motion that misner used to infer the quantum properties for high occupation numbers .",
    "thus , the most impressive property of the quantum mixmaster , i.e. its `` classicality '' across the planckian era , is no longer well - grounded .    in the polymer framework , such impossibility to recover a quasi - classical behavior near the singularity , is enforced by noting that it is impossible to construct wave - packets peaked around the classical trajectoreies that do not impact against the potential .",
    "such packets can follow the classical trajectory for a finite time interval , after which the bounce of the wave packet against the potential walls takes place .",
    "we showed that this fact is a direct consequence of the time dependence of the potential well , resulting in a condition on the free motion of the wave packets which is correspondingly time dependent and , soon or later , is violated .",
    "we can conclude that the polymer features of the mixmaster model , i.e. the implications of this particular cut - off physics on the anisotropic degrees of freedom , enforces the relevance of the quantum nature of the model near the cosmological singularity , since they introduce a non - local effect of the potential walls on the behavior of wave packets , localized around classical trajectories .",
    "this result suggests that , to better focus on the behavior of a mixmaster model model near the cosmological singularity , it is necessary to implement a more rigurous semiclassical interpretation of the wavefunction toward the cosmological singularity in presence of cut - off induced effects , and a full quantum picture in the disscretized picture .",

    "<S> the main development of this analysis consists of investigating how , differently from the standard canonical quantum evolution , the high quantum number states are not preserved arbitrarily close to the cosmological singularity . </S>",
    "<S> this property emerges as a consequence , on one hand , of the no longer chaotic features of the classical dynamics ( on which the misner analysis is grounded ) , and , on the other hand , of the impossibility to remove the quantum effect due to the spatial curvature . in the polymer picture , the quantum evolution of the bianchi ix model remains always significantly far from the semiclassical behavior , as far as both the wave - packet spread and the occupation quantum numbers are concerned . as a result , from a quantum point of view , the mixmaster dynamics loses any predictivity characterization for the discrete nature of the universe anisotropy . </S>"
