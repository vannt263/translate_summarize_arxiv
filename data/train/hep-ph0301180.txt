    "in 2001 , soon after the starting of two dedicated b - factories , cp - violation was observed for the first time in b - meson decays , more precisely in the interference of mixing and decay of @xmath1 states , by the babar collaboration at slac @xcite and the belle collaboration at kek @xcite .",
    "this rather spectacular result definitely promoted the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) parametrization @xcite to the first theory of microscopic irreversibility .    in 1999 , direct cp - violation was eventually established in k - meson decays by two other experiments ( na48 at cern @xcite and ktev at fermilab @xcite ) , after tremendous efforts .",
    "today , the @xmath2 parameter is accurately known experimentally , but is still of no use to constrain the unitary ckm mixing matrix .",
    "strong dynamics at low scale is mainly responsible for this paradoxical situation in weak decay physics . in particular",
    ", the so - called @xmath3 rule leads to large hadronic uncertainties in @xmath4 decay amplitudes . at the b - mass scale",
    ", we expect genuine patterns to emerge for branching ratios of two - body weak decay processes related by hadronic flavor symmetries such as isospin .",
    "so , the future of @xmath5-meson phenomenology may look bright in view of the opening of so many decay channels .",
    "however , if we want to shed some new light on cp - violation , we have somehow to rely on a quark - gluon picture .",
    "but the operator product expansion methodology inevitably involves many hadronic matrix elements .",
    "moreover , present technologies within qcd do not provide rigorous predictions on the cp - conserving strong phases induced by final state interactions ( fsi ) at the finite b - mass scale .",
    "consequently , we usually have to rely on specific models for hadron dynamics to probe the ckm mixing matrix through our beloved direct cp - asymmetries .",
    "many bounds on the ckm angle @xmath6 from @xmath7 decay rates and cp - asymmetries have been derived since five years @xcite .",
    "however , they all require some assumption on the origin and size of the cp - conserving strong phases involved . in this letter , we would like to illustrate , without theoretical prejudice beyond isospin invariance , how the observed @xmath7 decay modes might become soon a reliable test for the rather simple though controversial su(2)-elasticity and on - shell @xmath8 rescattering hypotheses .",
    "the measured exclusive semi - leptonic decay width ratio @xcite@xmath9 is very close to the value expected from isospin symmetry .",
    "a factor 1/2 originates indeed from the @xmath10 clebsch - gordan coefficient for @xmath11 .",
    "so , the large @xmath12 lifetime observed @xcite@xmath13 requires a dominance of the @xmath3 amplitude @xmath14 over the @xmath15 amplitude @xmath16:@xmath17 if we adopt the standard parametrization for the hadronic k - decay amplitudes@xmath18    the ckm theory for cp - violation requires a link between the hadron world and its quark - gluon representation . in the free - quark approximation ,",
    "the effective @xmath19 weak hamiltonian for a semi - leptonic or hadronic decay simply factorizes into two currents .",
    "however , hadronic decays also involve non - factorizable gluon exchanges between these currents .",
    "in particular , factorizable ( f ) quark diagrams easily explain eq.([eq1 ] ) but are unable , alone , to produce the @xmath20 final state ( see fig.1a ) .",
    "hence@xmath21 and this neutral state is only reachable through either @xmath22 hadronic rescattering ( @xmath23 ) or non - factorizable ( nf ) quark diagrams ( see fig.1b ) .",

    ", the rather large central value for the @xmath42 mode definitely excludes a new @xmath3 rule . on the other hand ,",
    "the surprisingly large central value for the @xmath20 mode apparently requires a sizeable cp - conserving phase ( @xmath43 ) @xcite to dilute the fully factorized hierarchy ( see eq.([eq5 ] ) ) predicted by fig.1a .",

    "however , it might be worth recalling that these approximations do not assert that each specific inelastic channel is small , but only assume that the over all inelastic channels still vanishes when the b mass is taken finite . as a matter of fact , the recent isospin analysis of the measured @xmath120 decays @xcite does not contradict this hypothesis .",
    "the present experimental data do not allow us to exclude one of these hadronic models for final state interactions .",
    "consequently , we propose a phenomenological test without theoretical prejudice beyond isospin invariance .    in the phenomenologically reasonable limit of perfectly structured @xmath7 branching ratios , we have obtained three possible sets of quantized cp - asymmetries displayed in table 1.@xmath121{|c|l|c|c|c|}\\hline &   & \\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{cp - asymmetries}\\\\\\cline{3 - 5 } & br & su(2)-elastic & su(3)-elastic & on - shell $ c\\overline{c}$\\\\\\cline{3 - 4}% \\cline{3 - 5}% \\multicolumn{1}{|c| } { } &   & $ \\pi k\\rightleftharpoons\\pi k$ & \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{$% \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\pi k\\rightleftharpoons\\pi k\\\\ \\eta_{8}k\\rightleftharpoons\\pi k \\end{array } $ } & $ \\bar{d}d_{s}\\rightleftharpoons\\pi",

    "however , their relative weight can only be determined through su(3 ) arguments which are in principle beyond the scope of the present work . yet , extracting the factorizable contribution from the available @xmath35 data , we checked numerically that corrections to table 1 can not exceed 20% in the full flavor - su(3 ) limit , if the ckm angle @xmath6 is larger or equal to 60@xmath122 .    to our surprise ,",
    "relative signs between cp - asymmetries are sufficient to exclude models for fsi ( see table 1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that more precise measurements of cp - asymmetries in @xmath7 decays will allow us to discriminate soon between the various possible scenarii for final state interaction effects discussed in the present paper",
    ". if such is the case , the ckm angle @xmath6 will be directly accessible and confidently confronted with its best - fit value extracted from the standard unitary triangle .",
