    "the problem of quantifying the uncertainty of the solution of systems of partial or ordinary differential equations has become in recent years a rather active area of research .",
    "the realization that more often than not , for problems of practical interest , one is not able to determine the parameters , initial conditions , boundary conditions etc . to within high enough accuracy , has led to a flourishing literature of methods for quantifying the impact that this uncertainty imposes on the solution of the problems under investigation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , despite the increase in computational power and the development of various techniques for uncertainty quantification there is still a wealth of problems where reliable uncertainty quantification is beyond reach .",
    "the main reason behind the inadequacy is the often high dimensionality ( in probability space ) of the uncertainty sources . when this uncertainty is coupled with the fact that for practical problems , even solving the corresponding equations for one value of the uncertain parameter ( initial condition , boundary condition , @xmath0 ) can be very expensive , it results in the uncertainty quantification problem being a rather formidable task .",
    "one way to address this problem is to look for reduced models for a subset of the variables needed for a complete description of the uncertainty .    in the current work",
    ", we are concerned with the construction of reduced models for systems of differential equations that arise from polynomial chaos expansions of solutions of a pde or ode system . in @xcite",
    "we focus on the construction of reduced models when there exists uncertainty in the parameters of the original system . in the current work ,",
    "we focus on the case that the given pde or ode system has uncertain initial condition .",
    "our goal is to construct a reduced model for the evolution of a subset of the polynomial chaos expansions that are needed for a complete description of the uncertainty caused by the uncertainty in the initial condition .",
    "there are different methods to construct reduced models for pde or ode systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we choose to use the mori - zwanzig ( mz ) formalism in order to construct the reduced model @xcite .",
    "the main issue with all model reduction approaches is the computation of the memory caused by the process of eliminating variables from the given system ( referred to as the full system from this point on ) @xcite .",
    "the memory terms are , in general , integral terms which account for the history of the variables that are not resolved . in principle",
    "the integrands appearing in the memory terms can be computed through the solution of the orthogonal dynamics equation @xcite .",
    "however , the solution of this equation is usually very expensive . as we did in @xcite , here too",
    ", we utilize a markovian reformulation of the mz formalism which allows the calculation of the memory terms through the solution of ordinary differential equations instead of the computation of convolution integrals as they appear in the original formulation . for the example presented in @xcite ,",
    "the parameters appearing in the reduced model could be estimated _ without _ having to solve the full system . in the current work , this is not possible .",
    "however , we present an algorithm which allows the estimation of the necessary parameters on the fly .",
    "this means that one starts evolving the full system and use it to estimate the reduced model parameters .",
    "once this is achieved , the simulation continues by evolving _ only _ the reduced model with the necessary parameters set equal to their estimated values from the first part of the algorithm .",
    "section [ mz_formalism ] presents a brief introduction to the mz formalism for the construction of reduced models of systems of odes . in section [ memory_comp ]",
    "we develop the markovian reformulation of the mz formalism and show how one can estimate adaptively the parameters appearing in the reduced model .",
    "section [ example ] applies the reformulation of mz presented in section [ memory_comp ] to the viscous burgers equation with uncertain initial condition .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] we discuss certain directions for future work .",
    "we begin with a brief presentation of the mori - zwanzig formalism @xcite .",
    "suppose we are given the system @xmath1 where @xmath2 with initial condition @xmath3 our goal is to construct a reduced model for the modes in the subset @xmath4 the system of ordinary differential equations we are given can be transformed into a system of linear partial differential equations @xmath5 where @xmath6 the solution of is given by @xmath7 .",
    "using semigroup notation we can rewrite ( [ pde ] ) as @xmath8 suppose that the vector of initial conditions can be divided as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the vector of the resolved variables ( those in @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 is the vector of the unresolved variables ( those in @xmath13 ) .",
    "let @xmath14 be an orthogonal projection on the space of functions of @xmath10 and @xmath15    equation can be rewritten as @xmath16 where we have used dyson s formula @xmath17 equation ( [ mz ] ) is the mori - zwanzig identity .",
    "note that this relation is exact and is an alternative way of writing the original pde .",
    "it is the starting point of our approximations .",
    "of course , we have one such equation for each of the resolved variables @xmath18 . the first term in ( [ mz ] )",
    "is usually called markovian since it depends only on the values of the variables at the current instant , the second is called `` noise '' and the third `` memory '' .",
    "if we write @xmath19 @xmath20 satisfies the equation @xmath21 if we project ( [ ortho ] ) we get @xmath22 since @xmath23 . also for the initial condition @xmath24 by the same argument .",
    "thus , the solution of ( [ ortho ] ) is at all times orthogonal to the range of @xmath25 we call ( [ ortho ] ) the orthogonal dynamics equation .",
    "since the solutions of the orthogonal dynamics equation remain orthogonal to the range of @xmath14 , we can project the mori - zwanzig equation ( [ mz ] ) and find @xmath26",
    "in this section we describe a reformulation of the problem of computing the memory term which does not use the orthogonal dynamics equation .",
    "we focus on the case when the memory has a finite extent only .",
    "the case of infinite memory is simpler and is a special case of the formulation presented below .",
    "also , the current reformulation allows us to comment on what happens in the case when the memory is very short .",
    "let @xmath27 by the change of variables @xmath28 note , that @xmath29 depends both on @xmath30 and the resolved part of the initial conditions @xmath31 we have suppressed the @xmath10 dependence for simplicity of notation .",
    "if the memory extends only for @xmath32 units in the past ( with @xmath33 ) then @xmath34 the evolution of @xmath29 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 to allow for more flexibility , let us assume that the integrand in the formula for @xmath37 contributes only for @xmath38 units with @xmath39 then @xmath40 we can proceed and write an equation for the evolution of @xmath37 which reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 similarly , if this integral extends only for @xmath43 units in the past with @xmath44 then @xmath45 this hierarchy of equations continues indefinitely .",
    "also , we can assume for more flexibility that at every level of the hierarchy we allow the interval of integration for the integral term to extend to fewer or the same units of time than the integral in the previous level .",
    "if we keep , say , @xmath46 terms in this hierarchy , the equation for @xmath47 will read @xmath48 where @xmath49 note that the last term in involves the unknown evolution operator for the orthogonal dynamics equation .",
    "this situation is the well - known closure problem .",
    "we can stop the hierarchy at the @xmath46th term by assuming that @xmath50    in addition to the closure problem , the unknown evolution operator for the orthogonal dynamics equation appears in the equations for the evolution of @xmath51 through the terms @xmath52 @xmath53 respectively .",
    "we describe now a way to express these terms involving the unknown orthogonal dynamics operator through known quantities so that we obtain a closed system for the evolution of @xmath54    since we want to treat the case where @xmath32 is not necessarily small , we divide the interval @xmath55 $ ] in @xmath56 subintervals .",

    "the construction presented above relies on an accurate determination of the memory lengths @xmath81 we present in this section a way to estimate these quantities on the fly .",
    "this means that we start evolving the _ full _ system , use it to estimate @xmath82 and then switch to the reduced model with the estimated values for @xmath81    for simplicity of presentation we assume that we evolve only @xmath83 and use only one subinterval to discretize the time integrals , i.e. @xmath84 the reduced model reads    @xmath85    for @xmath86 we can solve formally and substitute in to get @xmath87 where @xmath88 recall that , for the resolved variables , we have from the full system @xmath89 we would like to estimate the memory decay parameter @xmath32 so that the reduced equation for @xmath90 reproduces the behavior of @xmath90 as predicted by the full system .",
    "we can do that by requiring that the evolution of some integral quantity of the solution is the same when predicted by the reduced and full systems .",
    "we begin by discretizing the integral term in .",
    "suppose that we are evolving the full system with a step size @xmath91 where @xmath92 ( note that @xmath93 increases as @xmath30 increases ) .",

    "there is freedom in the choice of the integral quantity whose evolution the reduced model should be able to reproduce .",
    "for example , we can use @xmath98 the squared @xmath99 norm of the resolved variables .",
    "if we use this integral quantity , then from and we find that the unknown parameter @xmath32 must satisfy @xmath100 where @xmath101 \\frac{\\delta t}{2}\\ ] ] and @xmath102 denotes the real part .",

    "for the numerical results we present in section [ example ] , newton s method converged to double precision accuracy within 4 - 5 iterations . after an estimate",
    "@xmath107 has been obtained , we can find the estimate @xmath108 of @xmath32 ( recall @xmath109 ) from @xmath110      for each time instant @xmath30 we can obtain through equations and , an estimate @xmath111 for @xmath112 thus , the most important issue that we have to address is that of deciding which is the best estimate of @xmath112 in other words , at what time @xmath113 should we stop estimating the value of @xmath32 so that we can use the estimated value @xmath114 to evolve the reduced model from then on .",

    ". however , this will not always be the case .",
    "if keeping @xmath119 is not enough , then @xmath116 will decrease with increasing @xmath30 up to some time @xmath120 when it will reach a nonzero minimum .",
    "after that time , it starts increasing .",

    "this means that there is no adjustable reduced model parameter that needs to be specified at the onset of the algorithm .",
