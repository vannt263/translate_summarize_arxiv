    "quantum gases , i.e. systems in which the thermal de broglie wavelength is larger than the average particle distance are an ever increasingly important area of theoretical and experimental study with applications as diverse as quantum computing and quantum simulation of general relativity models .",
    "the most important example of such physics is the bose - einstein condensate where a macroscopic number of bosonic particles at low temperature share the same wavefunction .",
    "after early work on liquid helium , the physics of condensates has been experimentally studied in ultracold atomic gases and , more recently , in exciton - polariton fluids in semiconductor microcavities .",
    "building on these latter studies , an ever growing community is now active on the study of the so - called quantum fluids of light , where the many - photons forming the beam are seen as a gas of interacting particles via the optical nonlinearity of the medium @xcite . among the many hydrodynamic effects that are presently being studied in such fluids of light , we can mention turbulence @xcite , where the general physical processes found in a fluid or superfluid can be found in many other systems such as plasmas or in astrophysical systems .",
    "another intriguing direction is so called `` analogue gravity '' where flowing fluids are used to model gravitational spacetime geometries @xcite .",
    "waves propagating on top of a flowing medium behave the same way as light waves in a gravitational field .",
    "hence , by tailoring the properties and flow geometry of such a medium , it is possible to mimic gravitational spacetimes in a laboratory experiment . as an alternative to actual flowing fluids",
    ", optical analogues obtained using laser beams propagating through nonlinear self - defocusing media or confined in nonlinear optical cavities have been proposed to create a photon fluid with the desired flow pattern . in these systems",
    "the fluid properties can be controlled through the phase and intensity of the incident optical field as well as by the refractive index profile and the structural boundaries of the medium @xcite .",
    "for example , a theoretical framework for photon fluids @xcite has shown that sound - like excitations experience a curved spacetime and hence are promising models for analogue gravity experiments . a full",
    "quantum simulation showing evidence for analog hawking radiation from a black hole horizon in a fluid of light was performed in @xcite and the first experimental reports of black hole horizons in fluids of light were reported in @xcite .",
    "the effective photon - photon interaction in the nonlinear medium arises from the third - order kerr nonlinearity @xcite , i.e. the local change in refractive index proportional to the light intensity @xmath0 : a defocusing nonlinearity with @xmath1 giving repulsive interactions is required to observe a dynamically stable photon fluid .",
    "such a nonlinearity may be obtained through the thermo - optic effect , i.e. an intense laser beam locally heats the medium , which reacts by decreasing the refractive index proportionally to the deposited laser energy thus giving rise to an effective repulsive photon - photon interaction @xcite .",
    "here , we study and propose a relatively well known nonlinear medium , i.e. the thermal defocusing medium described above however , revisited within the context of a fluid of light .",
    "the aim is to study the extent to which such systems can indeed represent a novel platform for studying , at room temperature , the properties of quantum gases with an emphasis on ( but not limited to ) the exciting perspective of reproducing superfluid behaviour , phonon propagation according to the bogoliubov dispersion , and particle generation from a black hole horizon and in an analogue gravity set - up . in the propagating geometry considered here ,",
    "the dynamics of the fluid takes place in the transverse plane ( x , y ) of a laser beam propagating through a bulk nonlinear medium , so that the propagation coordinate z plays the role of the time coordinate @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "hence , by imaging the evolution of the beam profile along the @xmath3-coordinate , it is possible to detect the spatio - temporal evolution of effective sound modes in the photon fluid ( i.e. small oscillations on the transverse beam profile ) and extract information on the dispersion relation of its elementary excitations . using a technique inspired from oceanography , we obtain information on the high wavevector part of the dispersion where excitations have a single - particle nature and we detect the effect of global flow of the fluid . then , a pump - and - probe technique is presented , where the probe beam is used to create elementary excitations in the fluid generated by the pump .",
    "information on the elementary excitation dispersion is obtained from the lateral shift of the interference pattern of pump and probe beams : signatures of the collective nature of the excitations and of the non - locality of the photon - photon interactions are identified and discussed .",
    "an important result of this study is the experimental verification of the existence of a ( phonon ) wavelength regime in which , using the terminology introduced by chiao et al .",
    ", photon superfluidity can be observed @xcite .",
    "the propagation of a monochromatic laser beam with a vacuum optical wavelength @xmath4 in a self - defocusing medium can be described at steady state by the non - linear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) : @xmath5 where @xmath3 is the propagation direction , @xmath6 the optical wave vector and @xmath7 is the linear refractive index of the medium .",
    "the laplacian term @xmath8 with respect to the transverse coordinates @xmath9 describes the linear diffraction of the laser beam , where the second , nonlinear , term proportional to @xmath10 refers to the optical kerr nonlinearity , i.e. an intensity - dependent refractive index . in this work",
    ", we will always take @xmath11 , that is a self - defocusing nonlinearity , which guarantees transverse stability of the beams . by writing the field @xmath12 in terms of its amplitude and phase",
    "@xmath13 , equation ( [ eq : nlse ] ) can be re - written as two differential equations @xcite @xmath14 formally identical to the density and phase equations of a two - dimensional bec , the temporal variable @xmath15 being proportional to the propagation distance .",

    "the small amplitude perturbations @xmath20",
    "( @xmath21 is the background field ) can be described within the bogoliubov theory in terms of sound waves on top of the photon fluid  @xcite . in the spatially homogeneous case where @xmath21 does not depend on the transverse coordinate @xmath22 , a sound mode of wavevector @xmath23 and amplitude",

    ", only long - wavelength sound modes with @xmath34 follow a sonic dispersion with a constant sound speed @xmath35 .",
    "this is of particular relevance , since only a linear dispersion guarantees superfluid behaviour  @xcite and , in the context of analogue gravity , lorentz invariance in the acoustic metric @xcite . + translating these concepts in to the language of optics  @xcite , @xmath36 is the magnitude of the transverse wave vector of the light field and @xmath37 is related to the change @xmath38 in the wave vector along the propagation axis . to experimentally access the low frequency modes",
    "i.e. the @xmath34 regime , the light has to propagate in the nonlinear medium for at least one oscillation period @xmath39 , so with @xmath40 , one arrives at a minimum propagation length given by @xmath41 .",
    "we therefore see that for a reasonable nonlinearity of @xmath42 , long samples with at least @xmath43 cm length are required to observe the propagation of modes that lie in the linear regime of the dispersion .",
    "a natural choice for the nonlinear material is therefore a liquid that exhibits a thermo - optic nonlinearity .",
    "the main advantage is that samples of the required dimensions can easily be built and that they are isotropic . in thermo - optical media",
    ", self - defocusing of the laser beam arises due to partial absorption of the beam , which results in heating effects and thus to a decrease in the refractive index @xcite .",
    "thermal nonlinearity is usually highly nonlocal , i.e. the change in refractive index at any position depends not only on the local intensity , but also on surrounding field intensities @xcite .",
    "this is a result of heat conduction inside the nonlinear medium and has a striking influence on the wave dynamics in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "the medium response may be described by a response function @xmath44 so that @xmath45 can be written as @xmath46 with @xmath47 being a normalisation factor and @xmath48 the field intensity . in general",
    ", @xmath49 depends on the nonlocal process in the material and can be of different shapes .",
    "it is also important to note that due to the long - range nature of thermal diffusion , @xmath49 will also depend on the boundary conditions , e.g. on the shape and materials used for the cell containing the liquid @xcite . for thermo - optical media",
    "an isotropic exponential decay was proposed for @xmath50 , where the width of the response function @xmath51 defines the degree of nonlocality @xcite .",
    "+ straightforward extension of the bogoliubov theory to non - local media leads to a modified bogoliubov dispersion of the form @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the three - dimensional fourier transform of the response function @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to see that well within the paraxial approximation @xmath55 , the rescaled bogoliubov frequency @xmath56 , so the main contribution to the non - locality comes from the @xmath57 dependence of @xmath53 , and we can simplify @xmath58 in eq .",

    "@xmath59 the nonlinearity is responsible for the linear , sonic shape of the dispersion @xmath60 . at very large wavevectors @xmath61 , the dispersion recovers the quadratic single - particle dispersion @xmath32 .",
    "the effect of the non - locality is most interesting for @xmath62 : in this case , there is a wide range of @xmath63 where the nonlocality suppresses the effectiveness of the nonlinearity and the dispersion is pushed towards the single - particle dispersion already at @xmath64 . for a sufficiently small @xmath51 and a sufficiently fast decrease of @xmath49 ( faster than the one we are considering here , e.g. gaussian ) , a ring of roton - like minima appears in the dispersion for finite @xmath57 @xcite . as a sonic shape of the dispersion of excitations is essential for gravitational or superfluid analogies to be rigorous , experimental studies in this direction require having control over the nonlinear and nonlocal properties of the material .",
    "+ in the following , we report experimental evidence of a photon fluid in a nonlocal , self - defocusing medium . we adapted a method from oceanography to measure the spatiotemporal dispersion relation and show that by controlling the phase and intensity of the laser beam , we can imprint a flow as well as tune the velocity of acoustic waves .",
    "we then demonstrate a second method , based on tracking the sound speed of waves in the photon fluid as a function of input power , that allows us to measure both the local nonlinear refractive index change , @xmath45 and the nonlocal length of the medium , @xmath51 .",

    "the experiments were carried out by launching a collimated cw - laser beam with @xmath73 nm wavelength through a cylindrical tube with length @xmath74 cm ( 2 cm diameter ) filled with a methanol / graphene solution .",
    "the beam is magnified to a waist diameter of @xmath75 cm by a 4-f telescope and the central portion with a radius of 1 cm is selected with an aperture to ensure a relatively flat intensity profile .",
    "methanol is known to have a negative thermo - optic coefficient of @xmath76 1/k but has a very low absorption coefficient of @xmath77 @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "nanometric graphene flakes ( 7 nm average size ) are therefore dissolved in the medium in order to increase absorption . differently from widely used dyes",
    ", graphene does not exhibit any efficient fluorescence mechanism so that most of the absorbed laser energy is converted directly into heat . by using a very dilute solution of graphene , it was possible to prepare samples with a total absorption that could be controllably chosen in the full 0 to @xmath79% region over the sample length and adjusted in our experiments so as to have 20% absorption .",
    "a camera / lens system is mounted on a computer - controlled , longitudinal translation stage , so that the transverse beam profile can be imaged at different positions along the propagation axis of the beam .",
    "the imaging was performed at a constant image distance to ensure uniform scaling in transverse and z - directions during scanning . since the z - axis maps into a time coordinate , it is possible to measure the spatiotemporal evolution of small intensity fluctuations on top of the beam by scanning along z and measuring the 2d beam profile at defined increments of @xmath80 .",
    "the input beam diameter was large enough so that linear diffraction is negligible along the sample . to directly measure the dispersion relation , a technique adapted from oceanographic studies",
    "was used where surface waves that naturally occur were recorded in both space and time and by calculating the fourier transform one obtains the dispersion of the medium @xcite .",
    "+        in our experiment , the set of images are stored in a 3d ( x , y , z ) dataset : the origin of the observed fluctuations is due to ( static ) classical amplitude noise that is always present on the transverse profile of any laser beam ( unless one invests significant effort to completely spatially filter it out ) . the dispersion @xmath81 can be calculated via the fourier transform of a lineout of the measured intensity signal @xmath82 .",
    "the resulting spectrum can be converted to frequency using @xmath83 . to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio ,",

    "some of the spectra also show vertical stripes or other features that do not lie on the dispersion curves and which we were able to attribute to small defects present e.g. on the input or output window facets .",
    "the main finding of these measurements is the observation of an apparently purely parabolic dispersion for all spatial k - vectors and for all sets of parameters .",
    "three different measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionrelations ] for three different angles of the input beam with respect to the sample ( and imaging ) axis in the @xmath85 plane .",

    "we attribute the purely parabolic dispersion to the nonlocal nature of the material that , as discussed above reduces the effectiveness of the nonlinearity for features smaller than the @xmath51 .",
    "a nonlocal length for methanol of @xmath89 @xmath67 m has been reported @xcite , implying that only modes with a much smaller @xmath90 m@xmath91 would appear to have a linear dispersion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nldr ] ) .",
    "+        we underline that in these measurements we are imaging the various photon fluid planes inside the actual nonlinear medium .",
    "this may cause some issues related to the fact that we can no longer consider this a linear imaging measurement and the nonlinearity may lead to deformations of the various object planes @xcite .",
    "we did however , experimentally verify that objects placed at the cell input could be imaged through the sample and that distortions only appeared to be significant in the presence of sharp transitions from very low to very high light intensity regions .",
    "we therefore expect that the images of the weak and smooth oscillations lying on top of the more intense laser beam background are not significantly distorted and that the overall shape of the measured dispersion curve is indeed correct .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that the dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : bogodr ] ) provides an excellent theoretical fit to the data for the zero - velocity flow case and provides a correct estimate of the photon fluid flow when the input beam is placed at an angle with respect to the imaging axis .",
    "+ however , it is clear that a more detailed and precise estimate of the low frequency behaviour and the presence or absence of superfluid behaviour should be assessed by a technique that does not require imaging through the nonlinear medium .",
    "the results obtained with such a technique are discussed in the next section .",
    "in this experiment , a pump - probe configuration was used to imprint a specific wavelength on top of the background beam as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we then study the wave dynamics for different background intensities .",
    "the probe beam was extracted from the pump beam using a beamsplitter and was attenuated with a half - wave plate and a polarising beam splitter .",
    "the probe beam is then recombined with the pump beam inside the sample : by controlling the relative angle of the two beams we create an interference pattern of the desired modulation depth ( @xmath92 ) and relative wavevector @xmath57 .",
    "both the pump and probe beams are loosely focused into the sample using a cylindrical lens pair to create an elliptical beam with a minor axis diameter of @xmath93 @xmath67 m and a rayleigh range longer than the sample ( @xmath94 cm ) . the interference wave pattern ( i.e. the photon fluid sound wave ) is finally imaged at the output facet of the sample and a shift of this pattern along the x direction can be measured as a function of the laser power [ fig .",
    "[ fig : shift](a ) ] .",
    "the final imaging stage is performed with a 1-to-1 imaging f=300 mm lens . in the focal plane",
    "we place a mask to eliminate the four - wave mixed wave , thus suppressing interference between counter - propagating bogoliubov modes and facilitating the measurement of the phase shift . so as to isolate the pump and probe beams .",
    "our pump - probe setup is similar to that used in the past to study periodic soliton formation @xcite albeit with a lower contrast in the pump - probe interference pattern and , as we discuss below , our attention is focused on the dynamics of the photon - fluid sound waves .",

    "however , the sound speed in the superfluid regime demonstrated is relatively low @xmath121 m / s and will require very long samples in order to observe significant wave propagation .",
