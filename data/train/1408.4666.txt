    "the ability to recognize encoded patterns is a very general and omnipresent skill in humans and animals . here , the term pattern can refer to a structure of any nature activating a sensory perception .",
    "however , recognition of visual and sonic patterns are the most common applications .",
    "developing artificial pattern recognition systems as well as investigating actual natural mechanisms of pattern recognition in humans and animals has been a scientific challenge for decades @xcite .",
    "the most famous dynamical model is probably the one developed by hopfield in 1982 @xcite .",
    "it is a recurrent artificial neural network consisting of coupled discrete elements .",
    "in contrast to feedforward networks the underlying graph might have loops leading to more complex dynamics and multistability , which in turn is used to store several patterns in the network .",
    "recently , there has been much effort in developing more realistic models of human pattern recognition @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the pattern recognition task is closely related to the memory function , and there is a strong evidence that memory and memory recall are related to synchronization of neuronal ensembles @xcite . on the other hand , in absence of stimuli parts of the brain are known to be in a desynchronized state @xcite .",
    "consequently , models under consideration mostly consist of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems that may possess complex dynamics @xcite .",
    "delay coupled networks is another class of systems which attracted much attention recently .",
    "even a system consisting of a single dynamical node with delayed feedback can be used effectively for information processing purposes as it is evidenced in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that a spiking network with delayed connections can exhibit reproducible time - locked but not synchronous firing patterns and the number of such patterns exceeds the number of neurons in the network by far .",
    "indeed , there is an increasing evidence that the brain s memory and retrieval functions are closely connected to spike timing @xcite .    here , we present an evidence that pattern recognition tasks can be performed by a system consisting of a single loop of delay coupled phase oscillators .",
    "in contrast to the hopfield model , patterns in this model are not stored as fixed points but as periodic orbits . in this way",
    ", time dimension is introduced in the information processing device , which is biologically plausible .",
    "we also mention that the simple ring structure makes it accessible to analytic investigations and , at the same time , it serves as a model for central pattern generators @xcite .",
    "the mechanism that we employ here is based on general properties of rings of time - delayed systems with different connection delays , described in @xcite . the delay transformation introduced",
    "therein is used for analyzing the appearance of different patterns in rings ( as well as more complex networks @xcite ) with nonidentical delays .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section [ sec : synchronous - motions ] we analyze the model equations with homogeneous delay . in particular , we study coexisting periodic solutions in such a system and their number and stability .",
    "section [ sec : the - pr - mechanism ] introduces the pattern recognition mechanism . in section [ sec : numerical - results ] we apply the model to various signals ranging from simple artificial ones to speech and present numerical results .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] concludes with a discussion and an outlook on various open questions .",
    "in this section we introduce the dynamical system used as a pattern recognition device and present some useful results concerning its dynamics . to our knowledge",
    "these results are new .",
    "we consider a delayed , unidirectional ring of phase oscillators    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and all the oscillators have the same individual frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the coupling between the oscillators is of strength @xmath3 and delayed by a time delay @xmath4 . provided with a global coupling structure these equations",
    "are well known as kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "a lot of research has been done on the synchronization properties of kuramoto oscillators with instantaneous coupling and related bifurcation scenarios since the 80s @xcite .",
    "similarly , delayed kuramoto oscillators are well investigated @xcite , whereas there are fewer results on phase oscillators with a local coupling structure , neither with instantaneous @xcite nor delayed coupling @xcite .",
    "as our aim is to construct / memorize and recognize patterns by means of synchronous states , we first have to assure the existence of the synchronous solutions .",
    "we remark that by introducing new variables @xmath5 and rescaling the time @xmath6 system ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) transforms to @xmath7 .",
    "however , we will consider ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) , since it does not make the analysis more complicated and still keeps the coupling strength and frequency explicitly .",
    "synchronous periodic solutions of ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) are of the form @xmath8 for some mean frequency @xmath9 . substituting this solution in system ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] )",
    "yields the transcendental equation for @xmath10 @xmath11 now , introducing the variable @xmath12 equation ( [ eq : meanfrequency ] ) transforms to @xmath13 that is , we look for intersections of a straight line through the origin with slope @xmath14 and a shifted sine , see fig .",

    "parameters : @xmath19 and @xmath20.,width=336 ]    in order to visualize how multiple synchronous solutions ( [ eq : persol ] ) with different frequencies appear for different delay times @xmath18 , let us represent the solutions of ( [ eq : meanfrequency ] ) in the following parametric form @xmath21 so the same branch of periodic solutions reappears slightly inclined for larger values of @xmath18 , see fig . [ fig : persol ] ( b ) .",
    "both figures show that indeed , either increasing @xmath18 or @xmath22 leads to an increase of solutions of the form ( [ eq : persol ] ) .",
    "actually , it is known that the number of coexisting periodic solutions in systems with time delay @xmath18 grows at least linearly with @xmath18 @xcite . in our case , using simple geometrical arguments , one can show that the number of such solutions is approximately @xmath23 . a proof together with the stability analysis is given in the following section .",
    "the main result of this section is , that half of the above mentioned @xmath23 synchronous solutions are linearly stable , whereas the other half is unstable . to determine the linear stability consider the linearization of equation ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) along a synchronous solution of the form ( [ eq : persol ] ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the adjacency matrix of the unidirectional ring coupling , i.e. @xmath27 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 otherwise . here",
    "@xmath30 is the number of oscillators in the ring .",
    "thus the linear stability is given by the distribution of zeros @xmath31 of the following characteristic equation @xmath32 the solutions @xmath31 of this equation are the characteristic exponents ( eigenvalues ) whose real parts determine the stability .",
    "the obtained characteristic equation can be factorized to the set of @xmath30 more simple equations : @xmath33 where @xmath34 $ ] are @xmath30-th roots of unity .",
    "now we can prove the following lemma .",
    "let @xmath35 be a synchronous solution of ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) .",
    "the solution is linearly stable iff the following condition holds @xmath36 furthermore , if @xmath37 , the following upper bound for the real parts of the characteristic exponents @xmath31 holds true @xmath38    splitting equation ( [ eq : chareq2 ] ) into real and imaginary parts ( @xmath39 ) yields @xmath40 consider the two cases @xmath41 and @xmath42 : + i ) case @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath43 we have @xmath44 which contradicts equation ( [ eq : xeq ] ) . consequently , equation ( [ eq : xeq ] )",
    "can only be fulfilled for @xmath45 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath41 is also a necessary condition for stability which concludes the proof of the first part of the lemma .",
    "+ ii ) case @xmath42 .",
    "if we have @xmath46 the upper bound is automatically valid .",
    "so suppose we have a solution @xmath47 with @xmath43 .",
    "then the equation ( [ eq : xeq ] ) implies @xmath48 so for @xmath49 we would have @xmath44 which means that indeed , the real part @xmath50 of @xmath31 can be bounded as follows @xmath51    using the condition for stability from lemma 1 we obtain estimations for the number of coexistent stable and unstable periodic orbits .",
    "let @xmath52 .",
    "then there are at least @xmath53 stable and unstable periodic synchronous solutions of equation ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) , respectively .",
    "finding periodic solutions is equivalent to finding zeros of the function @xmath54 .",
    "we have seen in the last lemma , that a solution with frequency @xmath10 is stable if @xmath55 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath56 .",
    "motivated by this we define the disjoint intervals @xmath57 for which @xmath55 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we first remark that we have to fulfill @xmath58 ( see equation ( [ eq : meanfrequency ] ) ) .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the number @xmath59 of intervals @xmath60 lying in @xmath61 satisfies @xmath62 now in @xmath60 we have @xmath63 and further @xmath64 for all @xmath65 .",
    "so @xmath66 has exactly one zero in each @xmath60 by monotonicity . by the same argument there has to be an odd number of zeros in each @xmath67 . by the shape of @xmath66",
    "we conclude that it has one zero in each @xmath67 as well .",
    "so the total number of zeros @xmath68 in intervals @xmath67 has the same bounds as @xmath59 .      in subsection [ sub :",
    "existence - of - sync - sol ] we have seen that synchronous solutions undergo bifurcations as either the delay time @xmath18 or the coupling strength @xmath22 is varied .",
    "in this section we give some insight into these bifurcations . a solution ( [ eq : persol ] ) can change its stability when one of its characteristic exponents crosses the imaginary axis @xmath69 , @xmath70 . substituting @xmath69 into ( [ eq : chareq2 ] ) and splitting the obtained equation into real and imaginary parts yields @xmath71 the first equation in ( [ eq : iy ] ) is fulfilled if either @xmath72 or @xmath73 for some @xmath74 .",
    "plugged into the second equation both conditions yield @xmath75 .",
    "thus , hopf bifurcations with @xmath76 can not occur in the model .",
    "the only possible destabilization corresponds to eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis with vanishing imaginary part @xmath77 . on the other hand",
    ", every periodic solution has a trivial characteristic exponent @xmath78 corresponding to perturbations in the direction of the periodic motion . so in order to look for a change of stability we have to find non - simple zeros of the characteristic function .",
    "such non - simple zeros are possible if @xmath79 .",
    "this is fulfilled if either one of the following conditions holds @xmath80 the following lemma describes the type of bifurcations taking place if the conditions ( [ eq : perbif ] ) hold , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : bifdiag ] .",
    "we remind that @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath82 be a branch of synchronous solutions of equation ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) with @xmath83 . varying @xmath18 it undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath84 for any @xmath85 it undergoes a fold bifurcation at @xmath86 with @xmath87 defined as above .    as it was mentioned above , under conditions ( [ eq : perbif ] ) an eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis with vanishing imaginary part .",
    "so the observed bifurcations can either be transcritical or fold . in a fold",
    "bifurcation two new solutions emerge .",
    "this happens exactly when the right hand side in ( [ eq : meanfrequency ] ) crosses the identity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : persol](a ) ) , which is equivalent to @xmath88\\\\   & = & -\\tau\\kappa\\cos\\left(\\omega\\tau\\right)=-\\tau k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this condition also shows that at @xmath72 no other solution emerges , therefore , the bifurcation at @xmath72 is transcritical .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis with nonzero speed indeed .",

    "[ fig : bifdiag ] shows the obtained bifurcation diagram for synchronous solutions , including the stability information .",

    ", width=336 ]    we remark that , requiring @xmath91 and appropriate conditions on @xmath66 , the above analysis can be done for the more general system @xmath92 with similar results . for the linear stability see @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the idea of how pattern recognition can be realized with the ring of delay coupled oscillators .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that system ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) admits coexisting synchronous solutions @xmath93 with frequencies @xmath94 given by equation ( [ eq : meanfrequency ] ) . in analogy with the firing times of neuronal systems",
    "@xcite we pay special attention to the moments when an oscillator @xmath95 reaches the boundary of the periodic domain @xmath96 $ ] , i.e. @xmath97 .",
    "this choice of phase is arbitrary , and any other phase @xmath98 instead of @xmath99 can be chosen instead @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will use the obtained crossing time sequences @xmath100 to represent patterns . in section [ sub : encoding ]",
    "we explain how a given pattern can be encoded in a ring of phase oscillators , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pr_diagram ] .",
    "afterwards , in section [ sub : recognition ] we explain the dynamic recognition process .",
    "the process chart visualizes the encoding mechanism .",
    "step one is the recording and digitalization of a given stimulus .",
    "the second step is not mandatory for pattern encoding .",
    "however , we employ it in this article as it yields better results .",
    "it consists of a fast fourier transformation ( fft ) of the recorded stimulus .",
    "then , a firing sequence @xmath101 is associated to the fourier transform such that each value of the fft s square modulus is identified with the firing time of an element of the ring .",
    "the last step is calculating the coupling delays in the ring according to ( [ eq : new_delays ] ) , so the resulting dynamical system admits the firing sequence @xmath101 as a stable solution.,width=336 ]      the idea for encoding a pattern in a ring of delay coupled oscillators is based on a time shift transformation @xcite .",
    "we shortly describe it here .",
    "we assume that a pattern @xmath101 is represented by some @xmath30-dimensional vector @xmath102 .",
    "first , let us choose an @xmath103 that corresponds to a stable synchronous solution of ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) .",
    "the timeshift transformation @xmath104 converts ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) to the system @xmath105 which has the same form as ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) except that the new delays @xmath106 are non - identical . here",
    "we assume that @xmath107 , which is always possible by taking @xmath18 sufficiently large . under the transformation ( [ eq : time_shift ] ) , the synchronous state @xmath108 transforms into the solution @xmath109 of system ( [ eq : transformed_oscillators ] ) .",
    "the stability properties of this solution are also preserved @xcite .",
    "thus , in the system with non - homogeneous delays ( [ eq : transformed_oscillators ] ) , an oscillator @xmath110 crosses the phase @xmath99 at times @xmath111 .",
    "consequently , changing the delays @xmath112 yields the new system system ( [ eq : transformed_oscillators ] ) that exhibits exactly the required crossing sequence @xmath101 as a stable periodic solution .",
    "in particular , the encoding is not a dynamic process but just consists of the calculation of the @xmath30 delays @xmath113 .",
    "now suppose @xmath101 is encoded as described above .",
    "let @xmath114 be a perturbed version of pattern @xmath101 that is to be recognized .",
    "we associate an initial function for system ( [ eq : transformed_oscillators ] ) in a natural manner @xmath115 so for @xmath116 it corresponds to the synchronous state @xmath117 itself in transformed coordinates .",
    "then , the recognition task consists of deciding whether @xmath118 is recognized as the previously encoded pattern @xmath101 . in order to do",
    "so we start system ( [ eq : transformed_oscillators ] ) with the initial function @xmath119 associated to @xmath118 and stop after a fixed time @xmath120 . then some measure of similarity between @xmath121 , which is @xmath118 evolved under the flow of ( [ eq : transformed_oscillators ] ) , and @xmath101 is considered to decide whether @xmath118 should be recognized as @xmath101 .",
    "to specify the measure of similarity employed here , consider the following straightforward calculation .",
    "transformed back in original coordinates the initial function @xmath119 reads @xmath122 this means that solving system ( [ eq : transformed_oscillators ] ) with initial function @xmath119 ( corresponding to @xmath118 ) is equivalent to solving the original system ( [ eq : phaseoscillcont ] ) with initial function @xmath123 ( corresponding to @xmath124 ) .",
    "in other words , pattern @xmath118 is recognized as version of @xmath101 if the orbit with initial function @xmath123 corresponding to @xmath118 converges fast enough to the synchronous state with frequency @xmath103 ( where `` fast enough '' has to be quantified in a specific situation ) .",
    "consequently , we can use the order parameter @xmath125 as measure of similarity ( reference and/or explain here ? ) .",
    "it is worth stressing the fact that the essential parameters for the pattern recognition are the time @xmath120 after which we stop simulation of the differential equations and a threshold for the order parameter that lets us decide whether the flow after time @xmath120 is close enough to the synchronous state , that is whether the pattern is recognized or not .",
    "the choice of these parameters constitutes the learning phase .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for pattern recognition .",
    "an important quantity for the mechanism is the size and shape of the basin of attraction of the stable periodic solution representing the encoded pattern , as the basin contains initial conditions ( patterns ) that are possibly identified with the encoded pattern ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : simple - pattern - perturbation2 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "obviously , we can not present a complete picture of the basins of attraction as the phase space is infinite dimensional .",
    "however , we will address some aspects of this question numerically in the following sections .",
    "we start with a simple pattern @xmath126 .",

    "the task is the following : suppose two sine waves of different frequencies are encoded as two patterns @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "it is to decide whether a given third wave @xmath118 is recognized as either one of the two encoded sines . here",

    "[ fig : pr_diagram ] . according to our scheme ,",
    "the corresponding fourier transforms @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the pattern associated with the signals .",
    "the use of fourier transform has the following advantages : one can cut off the transformed signal above a certain frequency which can be seen as a simple denoising process and at the same time it accelerates the recognition process .",
    "furthermore , for short enough time windows the time course of the signal is not important and the fourier transform contains the main information independent of the signal s exact timing .",
    "the pattern associated to a sine wave of a fixed frequency @xmath66 is a delta peak @xmath141 ( in an ideal case without noise ) .",

    "above for sine waves , the pattern associated to an audio signal is its fourier transform .",
