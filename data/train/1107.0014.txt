    "in this note we are concerned with wave equations on lorentzian manifolds , with a particular interest in the cauchy problem in non - smooth situations . to achieve a self - contained presentation",

    "we first extend this theory to the case of distributional data and right hand sides .",
    "then we turn to the case where the metric is non - smooth , that is we deal with normally hyperbolic operators with coefficients of low regularity .",
    "actually the regularity class of the metric which we have in mind is below @xmath0 ( i.e. , the first derivative locally lipschitz)the largest class where standard differential geometric results such as existence and uniqueness of geodesics remain valid , and also below the geroch - traschen class of metrics  the largest class that allows for a consistent distributional treatment ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is evident that no consistent distributional solution concept is available for these equations .",

    "crossing singularities clarke himself used a cleverly designed weak solution concept to argue for local solvability of the wave equation ( @xcite ) . on the other hand vickers and wilson ( @xcite ) used colombeau generalized functions to show local well - posedness of the wave equation in conical space - times modelling a cosmic string .",
    "this result has been generalized to a class of locally bounded space - times in @xcite , also see @xcite for the static case and @xcite for an extension to non - scalar equations .",
