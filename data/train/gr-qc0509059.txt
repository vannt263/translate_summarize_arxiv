    "there is a long history of considering generalisations of einstein s theory of general relativity which reduce to general relativity in the weak gravity limit when the spacetime curvature , @xmath9 , becomes small .",
    "typically , these studies consider a gravitational lagrangian which augments the linear einstein - hilbert lagrangian by the addition of terms of quadratic or higher order in @xmath10 first considered by eddington @xcite ; these additions may also include terms in @xmath11 , @xcite .",
    "more general extensions of general relativity in this spirit have considered the structure of theories derived from gravitational lagrangians that are general analytic functions of @xmath9 , @xcite .",
    "these choices produce theories which can look like general relativity plus small polynomial corrections in the appropriate limiting situations as @xmath9 becomes small .",
    "there has also been interest in theories with corrections to general relativity that are @xmath12 because of their scope to introduce cosmological deviations from general relativity at late times which might mimic the effects of dark energy on the hubble flow @xcite .",
    "we also know that theories derived from a lagrangian that is an analytic function of @xmath9 have an important conformal relationship to general relativity with scalar field sources so long as the trace of the energy - momentum tensor vanishes in the higher - order gravity theory @xcite .",
    "all these theories introduce corrections to general relativity which come with a characteristic length scale that is determined by the new coupling constant that couples the higher - order terms to the einstein - hilbert part of the lagrangian . in general , these theories are mathematically complicated with 4@xmath13-order field equations that can exhibit singular perturbation behaviour unless care is taken to ensure that the stationary action does not become maximal rather than minimal @xcite .",
    "and there are few interesting exact solutions other than those of general relativity , which are particular solutions in vacuum and for trace - free energy momentum tensor so long as the cosmological constant vanishes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to consider a different type of generalisation of einstein s general relativity , in which no new scale is introduced .",
    "the lagrangian is proportional to @xmath14 , and so general relativity is recovered in the @xmath15 limit , from above or below .",
    "particular cases have been studied by buchdahl @xcite and roxburgh @xcite .",
    "this gravitation theory has many appealing properties and , unlike other higher - order gravity theories , admits simple exact solutions for friedmann cosmological models and exact static spherically symmetric solutions which generalise the schwarzschild metric . as well as allowing comparison with observation these solutions also provide an interesting testing ground for new developments in gravitation theory such as particle production , holography and gravitational thermodynamics .",
    "furthermore , this theory is of additional interest because it permits a very general investigation of the nature of its behaviour in the vicinity of a cosmological singularity which brings the behaviour of general relativity into sharper focus . in another paper @xcite ,",
    "we show that the counterpart of the kasner anisotropic vacuum cosmology can be found exactly and strong conclusions drawn about the presence or absence of the chaotic behaviour found in the mixmaster universe .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows ; in the next section we present the gravitational action and field equations for the theory of gravity we will be considering . a conformal relationship with general relativity containing a scalar field in a liouville ( exponential ) potential is then outlined and the newtonian limit of the field equations is investigated .",
    "the rest of the paper is then split into two sections ; the first investigates the cosmology of the theory and the second investigates the static and spherically symmetric weak field - in both cases our goal is to calculate predictions for physical processes , the results of which can be compared with observation .",
    "we use observational data from cosmology and the standard solar system tests of general relativity to bound the allowed values of @xmath16 , the single defining parameter of the theory .    in the cosmology section",
    "we consider friedmann  robertson  walker universes .",
    "we present the equivalent of the friedmann equations , in this theory , and find some power  law exact solutions . a dynamical systems approach",
    "is then used to show the extent to which these solutions can be considered as attractors of spatially flat universes at late times . after showing the attractive properties of these solutions ( with certain exceptions )",
    "we proceed to predict the results of primordial nucleosynthesis and the form of the power spectrum of perturbations in this theory .",
    "these predictions are then compared to observation and used to constrain deviations from general relativity .",
    "the static and spherically symmetric weak - field analysis follows .",
    "we present the field equations and find the physically relevant exact solution to them .",
    "a dynamical systems approach is then used to find the asymptotic attractor of the general solution at large distances .",
    "this asymptotic form is then perturbed and the linearised field equations are found and solved . the exact solution is shown to be the relevant solution in this limit , when oscillatory modes in the perturbed metric functions are set to zero .",
    "we find the null and time - like geodesics for this spacetime to newtonian and post - newtonian order .",
    "predictions are then made for the outcomes of the classical tests of general relativity in this theory ; namely the bending of light , the time - delay of radio signals and the perihelion precession of mercury .",
    "these predictions are then compared to observation and again used to constrain deviations from general relativity .",
    "we consider here a gravitational theory derived from the lagrangian density @xmath17where @xmath18 is a real number and @xmath19 is a constant .",
    "the limit @xmath20 gives us the familiar einstein ",
    "hilbert lagrangian of general relativity and we are interested in the observational consequences of @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "we denote the matter action as @xmath23 and ignore the boundary term . extremizing @xmath24with respect to the metric @xmath25 then gives @xcite @xmath26where @xmath27 is the energy ",
    "momentum tensor of the matter , and is defined in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath25 in the usual way .",
    "we take the quantity @xmath28 to be the positive real root of @xmath9 throughout this paper .      rescaling the metric by the conformal factor @xmath29 the vacuum field equations ( [ field ] ) become @xmath30where @xmath31 and other quantities with overbars",
    "are constructed from the rescaled metric @xmath32 .    making the definition of a scalar field    @xmath33    these equations",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath34and @xmath35where @xmath36 is given by @xmath37the magnitude of the quantity @xmath38 is not physically important and simply corresponds to the rescaling of the metric by a constant quantity , which can be absorbed by an appropriate rescaling of units .",
    "it is , however , important to ensure that @xmath39 in order to maintain the + 2 signature of the metric .",
    "this result is a particular example of the general conformal equivalence to general relativity plus a scalar field for lagrangians of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an analytic function found in refs .",
    "@xcite .      by comparing the geodesic equation to newton s gravitational force law",
    "it can be seen that , as usual , @xmath42where @xmath43 is the newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "all the other christoffel symbols have @xmath44 , to the required order of accuracy .",
    "we now seek an approximation to the field equations ( [ field ] ) that is of the form of poisson s equation ; this will allow us to fix the constant @xmath45 .",
    "constructing the components of the riemann tensor from ( [ chrn ] ) we obtain the standard results @xmath46the @xmath47 component of the field equations ( [ field ] ) can now be written @xmath48where terms containing derivatives of @xmath9 have been discarded as they will contain third and fourth derivatives of @xmath43 , which will have no counterparts in poisson s equation .",

    "it can be seen that the newtonian limit of the field equations ( [ field ] ) does not reduce to the usual relation @xmath56 , but instead contains an extra factor of @xmath57 .",
    "this can be interpreted as being the space ",
    "time dependence of newton s constant , in this theory .",
    "such a dependence should be expected as the lagrangian ( [ action ] ) can be shown to be equivalent to a scalar  tensor theory , after an appropriate legendre transformation are immediately applicable to this theory .",
    "it can be shown that a potential for the scalar - field can have a non - trivial effect on the resulting phenomenology of the theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the form of the perturbation to general relativity that we are considering does not allow an expansion of the corresponding scalar field of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is constant and @xmath60 , so that any constraints obtained in a weak - field expansion of this sort can not be applied to this situation . ] ( see e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "this type of newtonian gravity theory admits a range of simple exact solutions in the case where the effective value of @xmath55 is a power - law in time even though the theory is non - conservative and there is no longer an energy integral @xcite .",

    "walker metric with curvature parameter @xmath61 : @xmath62substituting this metric ansatz into the field equations ( [ field ] ) , and assuming the universe to be filled with a perfect fluid of pressure @xmath63 and density @xmath64 , gives the generalised version of the friedmann equations @xmath65where , as usual , @xmath66it can be seen that in the limit @xmath1 these equations reduce to the standard friedmann equations of general relativity .",
    "a study of the vacuum solutions to these equations for all @xmath61 has been made by schmidt , see the review @xcite and a qualitative study of the perfect - fluid evolution for all @xmath61 has been made by carloni et al @xcite .",

    "it can be seen from the graph that the density of matter required for a flat universe is dramatically reduced for positive @xmath18 , or large negative @xmath18 . in order for the critical density to correspond to a positive matter density we require @xmath81 to lie in the range @xmath82      the system of equations ( [ friedman1 ] ) and ( [ friedman2 ] ) have been studied previously using a dynamical systems approach by carloni , dunsby , capozziello and troisi for general @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we elaborate on their work by studying in detail the spatially flat , @xmath70 , subspace of solutions .",
    "this allows us to draw conclusions about the asymptotic solutions of ( [ friedman1 ] ) and ( [ friedman2 ] ) when @xmath70 and so investigate the stability of the power ",

    "firstly , the compactified phase plane for a universe filled with pressureless dust , @xmath141 , and a value of @xmath142 is shown in figure [ d0.1 ] .",
    "figure [ d0.1 ] is seen to be split into three separate regions labelled i , ii and iii .",
    "the boundaries between these regions are the sub - manifolds @xmath143 . as pointed out by carloni et .",
    "the plane @xmath144 is an invariant sub - manifold of the phase space through which trajectories can not pass .    the equation for @xmath9 in a frw universe , ( [ r2 ] ) ,",
    "can now be rewritten as @xmath145this shows that the boundary @xmath144 is given in terms of @xmath125 and @xmath146 by @xmath147 and that in region i the sign of @xmath148 must be opposite to the sign of @xmath18 in order to have a positive @xmath149 .",
    "similarly , in regions ii and iii , @xmath9 must have the same sign as @xmath81 in order to ensure a positive @xmath64 .",
    "it can be seen that regions ii and iii are symmetric under a rotation of @xmath150 and a reversal of the direction of the trajectories .",
    "as region ii is exclusively in the semi ",

    "circle @xmath152 and so all trajectories confined to this region correspond to eternally contracting ( or contracting and asymptotically static ) universes .",
    "region i , however , spans the @xmath153 plane and so can have trajectories which correspond to universes with both expanding and contracting phases .",
    "in fact , it can be seen from figure [ d0.1 ] that , for @xmath154 all trajectories in region i are initially expanding and eventually contracting .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ d0.1 ] that in region i the only stable attractors are , at early times , the expanding point 10 and at late times the contracting point 9 .",

    "notably , region i only has stable attractor points , at both early and late times , which have been shown to correspond to @xmath156constant ; region i therefore does not have an asymptotic attractor when @xmath157 , for the range of @xmath18 being considered . in region",
    "ii the only stable attractors can be seen to be the static point 5 at some early finite time , @xmath158 , and the expanding matter - driven expansion described by point 3 as @xmath159 .",

    "figure [ d-0.1 ] is split into three separate regions in a similar way to figure [ d0.1 ] , with the boundary between the regions again corresponding to @xmath144 and is given in terms of @xmath125 and @xmath146 by ( [ xy ] ) .",
    "regions ii and iii again correspond to expanding and contacting solutions , respectively .",
    "region i , still has point 10 as the early - time attractor and point 9 as the late - time attractor , but now has all trajectories initially contracting and eventually expanding .",
    "there are still no stable attractors in region i which correspond to regions where @xmath159 .",
    "region ii now has point 7 as an early - time stable attractor solution and point 1 as a late - time stable attractor solution , corresponding to @xmath162 as @xmath159 .",
    "point 3 , which was the stable attractor at late times when @xmath142 is now no longer located in region ii and can instead be located in region i where it is now a saddle - point in the phase plane .",
    "interestingly , the value of @xmath18 for which point 3 ceases to behave as a stable attractor ( @xmath163 ) is exactly the same value of @xmath81 at which the point moves from region ii into region i ; so as long as point 3 can be located in region i , it is the late - time stable attractor solution and as soon as it moves into region i it becomes a saddle - point . at this same value of @xmath164 point 1 ceases to be a saddle - point and becomes the late - time stable attractor for region ii , so that region ii always has a stable late - time attractor where @xmath159 .",
    "region iii behaves in a similar way to the description given for region ii above , under a rotation of @xmath165 and with the directions of the trajectories reversed .",
    "phase planes diagrams for @xmath141 with values of @xmath18 other than @xmath166 and @xmath167 , but still within the range    @xmath168    look qualitatively similar to those above with some of the attractor properties of the critical points being exchanged as they pass each other .",
    "notably , for @xmath169 point 3 returns to region ii and once again becomes the stable late - time attractor for trajectories in that region .",
    "the points that are the stable attractors for any particular value of @xmath18 can be read off from the tables in the previous section .",
    "universes filled with perfect fluid black - body radiation also retain qualitatively similar phase - plane diagrams to the ones above ; with the notable difference that the point 3 is always located in region ii and is always the late - time stable attractor of that region .",
    "this can be seen directly from the ricci scalar for the solution ( [ power ] ) which is given by @xmath170and can be seen to have the same sign as @xmath18 , for @xmath171 , and so is always found in region ii .    for a spatially - flat",
    ", expanding frw universe containing black - body radiation we therefore have that ( [ power ] ) is the generic attractor as @xmath157 .",
    "similarly , for a spatially - flat , expanding , matter - dominated frw universe ( [ power ] ) is the attractor solution as @xmath157 ; except when @xmath172 , in which case it is point 1 ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "if we require a stable period of matter domination , during which @xmath174 , we therefore have the theoretical constraint @xmath2 ( or @xmath169 ) .",
    "such a period is necessary for structure to form through gravitational collapse in the post - recombination era of the universe s expansion .",
    "the effect of a non  zero curvature , @xmath175 , on the cosmological dynamics is similar to the general relativistic case .",
    "the role of negative curvature ( @xmath176 ) can be deduced by noting that its effect is similar to that of a fluid with @xmath177 .",
    "the solution ( [ power ] ) is unstable to any perturbation away from flatness and will diverge away from @xmath178 as @xmath159 .",

    "we will use the solutions ( [ power ] ) as they have been shown to be the generic attractors as @xmath159 ( except for the case @xmath172 when @xmath141 , which has been excluded as physically unrealistic on the grounds of structure formation ) .",

    "if we assume that the geometry ( [ iso ] ) is a good approximation to the weak field for a static schwarzschild  like mass then it is not trivial to assume that the timelike geodesics used to calculate the rate of perihelion precession ( [ precession ] ) are the paths that material objects will follow . whilst we are assured from the generalised bianchi identities mag94 of the covariant conservation of energy ",

    "it is firstly assumed that the geometry of space  time in the solar system can be considered , to first approximation , as static and spherically symmetric .",
    "it is then assumed that this geometry is determined by the sun , which can be treated as a point - like schwarzschild mass at the origin , and is isolated from the effects of matter outside the solar system and from the background cosmology .",

    "it is useful to recast ( [ precession ] ) in the form @xmath389where @xmath390this allows for easy comparison with results which have been used to constrain the standard post - newtonian parameters , for which @xmath391the observational determination of the perihelion precession of mercury is not clear cut and is subject to a number of uncertainties ; most notably the quadrupole moment of the sun ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
