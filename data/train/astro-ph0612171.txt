    "ever since the identification of t tauri stars as young solar analogs ( ambartsumian 1947 ; 1949 ) , astronomers have sought to better understand the youngest phases of stellar evolution .",
    "the youngest optically revealed stellar objects ( ysos ) are still obscured by their natal envelopes and ambient cloud material , and hence are very faint in visible light . understanding the stellar and circumstellar properties of these young stars",
    "has proven feasible with the current generation of sensitive instrumentation and large aperture telescopes .",
    "the class i protostars represent the youngest ysos which are presently identified at optical and near - infrared wavelengths .    in the accepted classification scheme for early stellar evolution , class i , or protostellar t tauris ,",
    "are embedded young stars that are intermediate between extremely young stellar embryos ( class 0 ) and the more familiar classical t tauri stars ( cttss , class iis ; adams , lada & shu 1987 ; lada 1987 ) .",
    "the definition of these classes came from the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from 2 - 25@xmath1 m .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath7 = dlog(@xmath8f@xmath8)/dlog(@xmath8 ) , represents the shape of the sed .",
    "sources that have @xmath90.0 are designated class i with rising seds in the infrared , and those with @xmath100.0 are flat spectrum objects ( adams , lada & shu 1987 ; 1988 ) . the sed shapes of class is are well modeled as star+rotating disk systems with massive infalling envelopes and outflows ( kenyon et al . 1993a ; 1993b , kenyon & hartmann 1995 ; whitney et al . 1997 ; 2003 ; terebey et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it has become apparent from both the models and observations that a degeneracy in the spectral index exists between embedded protostars and more evolved but obscured t tauris , e.g. , cttss with disks viewed edge - on ( whitney et al . 1997 ; 2003 ; chiang & goldreich 1997 ; 1999 ; hogerheijde & sandell 2000 ) . investigations in optical through millimeter regimes have sought to better define the differences between class i stars and reddened class iis ( motte & andr 2001 ; park & kenyon 2002 ; white & hillenbrand 2004 ; andrews & williams 2005 ; eisner et al . 2005 ) .",
    "one of the outstanding discrepancies between the theory and observation of class i protostars is the `` luminosity problem '' first described by kenyon et al .",
    "if mass in an infalling protostellar envelope is accreting efficiently onto the stellar surface instead of only onto the circumstellar disk , then the luminosity from mass accretion should dominate the stellar photosphere by a factor of ten or more .",
    "however , for the class i stars that have been investigated , the mass accretion luminosities do not differ significantly from those of class iis ( gullbring et al .",
    "1998 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "1998 ; white & hillenbrand 2004 ) .",
    "this has led to speculation that either class i protostars are not in their main accretion phase and their mass was accumulated at a younger epoch ( white & hillenbrand 2004 ) , or that eruptive events of enhanced mass accretion in fu ori - like outbursts are responsible for building the bulk of the stellar mass ( kenyon et al .",

    "2001 ; park & kenyon 2002 ; forbrich , preibisch & menten 2006 ) , little is known about the cause and character of variability in most embedded protostars .",
    "spectral characteristics in the near - infrared provide important opportunities to study the environments and natures of ysos ( greene & lada 1996 ) . the k - band ( 2.0 - 2.4@xmath1 m ) spectra of class is typically have continuum emission that is flat or rising steeply toward longer wavelengths , and are often featureless aside from emission in atomic or molecular hydrogen transitions which indicate ongoing mass accretion and outflow activity , respectively ( greene & lada 1996 ; 1997 ; prato & simon 1997 ; muzerolle et al . 1998 ; davis et al .",

    ", class is have greater k - band infrared accretion excesses than the more evolved cttss , and stellar photospheric absorption features characteristic to their spectral types are often veiled to undetectability by the excess emission ( greene & lada 1996 ; 1997 ; luhman & rieke 1999 ; doppmann et al . 2005 ; ishii et al .",

    "the additional values described in table 4 were derived by dividing by the blackbody and removing the continuum shape from the spectra .",
    "for iras 04181 + 2654b no blackbody temperature was found to fit the k and l - band continuum with less than 15% average deviation , so a 2nd order polynomial fit was used .",

    "( 1988 ) can also be large . as a result , relations between water - ice optical depth or column density and the visual extinction are not well calibrated for class i protostars .      to better determine the natures of the stars , a 2-step method for spectral synthesis modeling was used .",
    "first , models were fit to the k - band spectra to determine the stellar type and infrared veiling at 2.22@xmath1 m .",

    "it seems plausible that a pronounced photospheric water vapor feature is confusing the identification of water - ice absorption .",
    "high spatial resolution images show that this source is probably dominated by scattered light at 2@xmath1 m ( duchene et al . in prep ) , so the relative fraction of scattered versus transmissed light may also affect the continuum shape in the 2 - 4@xmath1 m spectra .",
    "the available data ( table 9 ) suggest that iras 04158 + 2805 is a late - type star in transition between class i and ii phases .",
    "though , white & hillenbrand ( 2004 ) pointed out that the low and unresolved envelope mass ( table 9 ) may be a consequence of the lower central stellar mass , so additional data is required to confirm this interpretation .    _ iras 04181 + 2654a : _ this star shows weak photospheric absorption features , and a best spectral type of m3@xmath53 is found . the k - band accretion excess of r@xmath3=1.3 is the largest veiling value derived from these data .",

    "the k - band region shows a very steep spectral shape with photospheric absorption features and a best - fit spectral type of k7@xmath281 .",
    "photospheric absorption is often veiled to undetectability by infrared disk emission in young protostars . yet",
    ", in contrast to the spectra of 04181a , b shows no evidence for infrared veiling emission .",
    "additionally , iras 04181 + 2654b is undetected in the optical , the estimated i - band magnitude is @xmath1324 , consistent with the very large visual extinction derived from the infrared photometry and the k - band spectral modeling (  3 ) .",
    "the extinction derived from the k - band spectra corresponds within 1@xmath18 the extinction determined from the 2mass photometry .",
    "this result indicates that there is not a significant amount of scattered light or infrared accretion excess emission , both of which affect the a@xmath30 determinations from the photometry of class i protostars .",
    "iras 04181 + 2654b shows none of the near - infrared spectral indicators of youth , which argues against a class i nature .",
    "indeed , its protostellar designation is based on spatially unresolved iras fluxes with 04181a .",
    "iras 04181 + 2654b is too bright in the infrared to simply be a background k dwarf or giant star reddened by 40 magnitudes of extinction .",
    "a k dwarf observed behind the taurus dark clouds through @xmath1440 mag of obscuration would have an estimated k magnitude of @xmath1415 , which is 4 mag fainter than 04181b appears ( table 1 ) .",
    "moreover , its 10@xmath1 m spectrum has been modeled to have silicates in emission , which is an indicator of youth ( kessler - silacci et al . 2005 ) . curiously , the l - band flux is 50% fainter than expected from a reddened , unveiled young star photosphere ( figure 3c ) .",
    "the enhanced extinction and @xmath1435@xmath11 separation from 04181 + 2654a lead to the hypothesis that 04181 + 2654b could be a young star observed through the extended protostellar envelope of a ( motte & andr 2001 ) .",
    "if this is the case , the assumption of ism obscuration may be incorrect and this may be why the 2 - 4@xmath1 m spectral models could not fit the continuum shape .",
    "further spatially resolved observations , particularly at mid - infrared wavelengths , are necessary to determine the true nature of this interesting star .",

    "presence of the na features in emission imply that this star may be more massive than a typical k - m spectral type class i star .",

    "the strong visual extinction of a@xmath30=28.0 mag determined for iras 04295 + 2251 from the 2 - 4@xmath1 m spectral model must be caused in part by local disk or envelope material which attenuates the infrared light but scatters the optical flux ( eisner et al . 2005 ) .",
