    "recent cosmic observations , including type ia supernovae@xcite , large scale structure ( lss)@xcite and cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite have independently indicated that the universe is currently undergoing an accelerated expansion phase .",
    "the source for this late time cosmic acceleration has been dubbed `` dark energy '' , which is distinguished from ordinary matter species such as baryons and radiation in the sense that it has a negative pressure .",
    "the cosmic accelerated expansion of the universe occurs when the gravitational force produced by the barotropic ordinary matter is counteracted by the negative pressure of dark energy . despite many years of research and much progress ,",
    "the nature and the origin of dark energy have not been confirmed yet .",
    "phenomenologically , the best candidate of dark energy that is perfectly consistent with the current observation data is the so - called cosmological constant ( cc ) @xmath2 which was introduced by einstein in his gravitational field equations@xcite .",
    "however , cc explanation for dark energy encounters some fundamental obstacles in physics , _ e.g. _ , the fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem@xcite . from the particle physics perspective , the cc should be interpreted as the energy density @xmath3 of the quantum vacuum , which is close to planck density @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the reduced planck mass ) in magnitude .",
    "the observed value of the dark energy density is much less than that , @xmath6 . eliminating this great difference of about 123 orders of magnitude between the observed value of dark energy and that estimated from quantum field theory requires some severe fine - tuning mechanisms to work@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "even if this fine - tuning problem could be evaded , the coincidence problem remains due to the fact that the vacuum energy is time independent and non - dynamical .",
    "the resolution of cc problems has probably to wait for the advent of a satisfied quantum theory of gravity in 4-dimensional spacetime . as a temporary expedient in cosmology community",
    ", the fine - tuning problem is assumed to have been solved for some underlying reasons : cc is zero for some reason and dark energy that drives the late time cosmic accelerated expansion has nothing to do with it .",
    "notice that the observations actually say little about the time evolution of the equation of state ( eos ) of dark energy , researchers have proposed many alternative models ( see review article @xcite and references listed therein ) to explain the late time cosmic acceleration and alleviate the corresponding coincidence problem , among which the chaplygin gas model @xcite appears very interesting .",
    "in such a simple model , the acceleration of the universe at late times is due to an alien fluid that has the specific eos @xmath7 , with @xmath8 a positive constant .",
    "the intriguing characteristic of chaplygin gas is that in the flat robertson - walker background , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the scale factor of an expanding universe ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an integration constant . at early times when @xmath13 , the gas behaves as a pressureless dust , @xmath14 .",
    "meanwhile it approaches asymptotically a cosmological constant ( @xmath15 ) at late times when @xmath16 .",
    "the chaplygin gas model of dark energy suffers from strong observational pressure from explaining cmb anisotropies @xcite .",
    "this shortcoming is alleviated in a generalized chaplygin gas model introduced in @xcite with @xmath17 .",
    "however , it follows from the observational data that the parameter @xmath18 is severely constrained within the range @xmath19 at the @xmath20 confidence level , implying the little difference between the time dependent generalized chaplygin gas and the time independent cosmological constant .",
    "in this paper we study a new kind of fluid models of dark energy , whose eos is phenomenologically suggested to be @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is a dimensionless fine - tuning parameter , and @xmath24 is assumed to be the present energy density of the dark energy fluid .",
    "our aim is to examine to what extent this fluid model can deviate from the time independent cc .",
    "the investigation is restricted at the background level .",
    "we find that during the matter era the energy density of suggested dark energy fluid is suppressed compared to that of dark matter , satisfying the requirement for the sufficient growth of large - scale structure and the constraint of the universe age problem .",
    "the onset of late time cosmic acceleration occurs around the redshift @xmath25 .",
    "the coincidence problem why the accelerated expansion of the universe is rephrased as why the eos of dark energy fluid takes the suggested form , for which we have proposed a tachyon interpretation originated from superstring theory . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the planck units @xmath26 , and assume that there is no direct interactions between different fluids .",
    "eos of the pure cc is @xmath27 , where both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constant as we can see from the energy conservation equation when dark energy does not couple with barotropic fluids . in obtaining a dynamical dark energy fluid that deviates from pure cc",
    ", we can simply amend the eos of such a fluid to @xmath30 with an energy density dependent function @xmath31 .",
    "since lots of astrophysical data support the pure cc behaviour of dark energy fluid in the present time , we choose @xmath32 eos of the supposed dark energy fluid can alternatively be described by the ratio @xmath33 , which turns out to be @xmath34 in view of the astrophysical constraint on the universe",
    "age@xcite , we simply take the value of fine - tuning parameter @xmath23 to be @xmath35 in this work ( see explanation below eq.([eq:21 ] ) ) . thus , at large redshift , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . while at present , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .    to obtain a viable dark energy model we have to require that the energy density of dark energy fluid remains negligible during the barotropic matter dominating eras , emerging only at late times to give rise to the current observed accelerated expansion of the universe",
    ". therefore , we assume the coexistence of some independent barotropic fluids with suggested dark energy fluid in the model .",
    "eos of these barotropic fluids is assumed to be @xmath40 , where for simplicity @xmath41 . ] .",

    "different from cc , the energy density of dark energy fluid in the model under consideration evolves , which remains non - zero for a considerable duration so that the coincidence problem is alleviated .",

    "the latter is the future critical redshift , which predicts an incoming instant when the present cosmological acceleration dominated by dark energy fluid ceases but the decelerated expansion dominated by barotropic matter recovers .",
