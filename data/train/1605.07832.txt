    "anticonnected digraphs were studied in  @xcite , where several properties such as antihamiltonian connectivity have been considered .",
    "we will show in theorem  [ antipathcheck ] below that it is np - complete to decide whether a given digraph contains an antidirected path between given vertices .",
    "our main purpose is to introduce a related connectivity property based on the concept of a * forward antidirected trail * , i.  e.  a walk with no arc repeated which begins and ends with a forward arc and in which the arcs alternate between forward and backward arcs .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we show that , from an algorithmic point of view , anticonnectivity is not an easy concept to work with , since deciding whether a digraph contains an antidirected path between a given pair of vertices is np - complete",
    ". then we move to the main topic of the paper , antistrong connectivity , and show that this relaxed version of anticonnectivity is easy to check algorithmically .",
    "in fact , we show in section  [ assec ] that there is a close relation between antistrong connectivity of a digraph @xmath1 and its so called bipartite representation @xmath8 , namely @xmath1 is antistrong if and only if @xmath8 is connected .",
    "this allows us in section  [ asaugsec ] to find the minimum number of new arcs we need to add to a digraph which is not antistrong so that the resulting digraph is antistrong .",
    "furthermore , using the bipartite representation we show in section  [ matroidsec ] that the arc - minimal antistrong spanning subdigraphs of a digraph @xmath1 form the bases of a matroid on the arc - set of @xmath1 .",
    "more generally , we show that the subsets of @xmath9 which contain no closed antidirected trails are the independent sets of a matroid on @xmath9 . in section  [ asorsec ]",
    "we study the problem of deciding whether a given undirected graph has an antistrong orientation .",
    "we show how to reduce this problem to a matroid problem and give a characterization of those graphs that have an antistrong orientation . for the convenience of readers who are not familiar with matroids , we also provide , as an appendix , a purely graph theoretical proof of the key step which is lemma [ lem : mat3 ] .",
    "both proofs can be converted to polynomial time algorithms which either finds an antistrong orientation of the given input graph @xmath10 or produce a certificate which shows that @xmath10 has no such orientation . in section  [ detachsec ]",
    "we show that being orientable as an antistrong digraph can be expressed in terms of connected 2-detachments of graphs ( every vertex @xmath11 is replaced by two copies @xmath12 and every original edge @xmath13 becomes an edge between precisely one of the 4 possible pairs @xmath14 ) with the extra requirement that the 2-detachment is bipartite and contains no edge of the form @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "this imediately leads to a characterization of graphs having such a 2-detachment .",
    "finally , in section  [ nosepsec ] we show that one can decide in polynomial time whether a given digraph @xmath1 has a spanning antistrong subdigraph @xmath17 so that @xmath18 is connected in the underlying sense ( while it is np - hard to decide whether a given digraph contains a non - separating strong spanning subdigraph ) .",
    "+ we conclude the paper with some remarks and open problems .",

    "in fact , as we shall show below in theorem  [ antipathcheck ] , it is np - complete to decide whether there exists an antidirected @xmath2-path in a digraph @xmath1 .    the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new notion , antistrong connectivity , which turns out to take polynomial time to check and show that this has connections to several important topics in combinatorial optimization .",

    "<S> we discuss relations between antistrong connectivity and other properties of a digraph and show that the arc - minimal antistrong spanning subgraphs of a digraph are the bases of a matroid on its arc - set . </S>",
    "<S> we show that one can determine in polynomial time the minimum number of new arcs whose addition to @xmath1 makes the resulting digraph the arc - disjoint union of @xmath4 antistrong digraphs . in particular , we determine the minimum number of new arcs which need to be added to a digraph to make it antistrong . </S>",
    "<S> we use results from matroid theory to characterize graphs which have an antistrong orientation and give a polynomial time algorithm for constructing such an orientation when it exists . </S>",
    "<S> this immediately gives analogous results for graphs which have a connected bipartite 2-detachment . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study arc - decompositions of antistrong digraphs and pose several problems and conjectures . </S>",
