    "a major outstanding question in our ongoing efforts to understand the central engines of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is the origin of the dichotomy between radio - loud and radio - quiet objects .",
    "although both radio - loud and radio - quiet agns are thought to be powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole , it is not known why agns in the former class can produce collimated , relativistic radio jets , which power the giant radio lobes at large distances from their host galaxies , while agns in the latter class can not ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that the central engines of the two classes of objects are the same , but systematic differences in the properties of the host galaxies are the cause of the observed dichotomy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that there is a systematic difference between the central engines of radio - loud and radio - quiet agns , which is intimately related to their ability to form jets .",
    "such a difference could be the size of the accretion disk ( invoked in some wind models ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spin of the black hole ( thought to be the ultimate power source of the jets ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the structure of the inner accretion disk ( an ion torus or advection - dominated accretion flow , a.k.a .",
    "adaf , which allows some of the accreting matter to form an outflow ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray observations are a means by which one can investigate the last two of the above possibilities , since the x - rays are produced in the inner regions of the accretion flow . in particular , one can look for systematic differences in the x - ray spectral properties of radio - loud and radio - quiet agns that may indicate differences in the structure of the inner accretion disk or the spin of the central black hole .",
    "thus we and other groups have been carrying out systematic studies of the x - ray properties of radio - loud agns using archival as well as proprietary  and  observations .",
    "these studies have confirmed previously suspected systematic differences between radio - loud and radio - quiet agns @xcite . in particular , two spectral features that are the hallmarks of the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the fluorescent fe k@xmath5 line at 6.4  kev and the compton `` reflection '' hump at energies greater than 10  kev , are considerably weaker in the spectra of broad - line radio galaxies ( hereafter blrgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the above observational results suggest that the structure of the inner accretion disk of blrgs is different from that of seyfert galaxies , although the nature of this difference remains to be understood in detail .",
    "another potentially important trend is the x - ray baldwin effect @xcite , according to which the fe k@xmath5 lines of luminous quasars are systematically weaker ( i.e. , of lower equivalent width ; hereafter ew ) than those of the lower - luminosity seyfert galaxies .",
    "because the sample of objects studied by @xcite includes a mix of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ( hereafter qsrs and qsos , respectively ) , it is not yet clear whether and how such an effect applies to radio - loud and radio - quiet agns separately .",
    "finally , the immediate environment of the x - ray source appears to be different in radio - loud and radio quiet agns as evidenced by the properties of absorbing material along the line of sight .",
    "more specifically , the signature of a `` warm '' ( i.e. , ionized ) absorber , seems to be ubiquitous in seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but rare in broad - line radio galaxies @xcite . instead",
    ", radio - loud agns seem to display the signature of significant absorption by neutral matter in their x - ray spectra .    here",
    "we present the results of new observations of three intermediate - luminosity qsrs ( 3c  323.1 , pks  234901 , 4c  74.24 ; @xmath6 ) with  and , which were carried out as part of our larger program .",
    "the targets were specifically selected to bridge the gap in luminosity between the nearby and well - studied blrgs and the more luminous qsrs included in the sample of @xcite .",
    "all three are associated with large , double - lobed radio sources @xcite , which ensures that our line of sight is not close to the axis of their radio jet , thus the x - rays we observe are not contaminated by beamed emission from the jet itself .",
    "the goal of the observations was to investigate the properties of intermediate - luminosity qsrs and to check whether the systematic differences between seyfert galaxies and blrgs extend to higher luminosity objects . in this respect ,",
    "4c  74.26 is a particularly interesting object because its  x - ray spectrum @xcite showed features that are hallmarks of seyfert galaxies but not blrgs : a `` warm '' absorber with a column density of @xmath7 and a significant compton `` reflection '' hump .",
    "it was also the only qsr in the collection of @xcite with a detectable fe  k@xmath5 line .",
    "in  2 we describe the observations and basic data analysis while in  3 we present the results of fitting models to the spectra . in ",

    "observations of pks  234901 and 3c  323.1 were carried out in 1999 december and 2000 february , respectively .",
    "table  1 reports the observation log .",
    "the sis detectors were operated in 1-ccd faint mode half of the time and in 1-ccd bright mode for the remaining portion , while the gis detectors were operated in ph mode .",
    "the data were screened within ftools / xselect v.4.2 @xcite following the procedures described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the final net exposure times are included in table  1 .",
    "after screening , we extracted spectra and light curves for each of the @xmath10 detectors .",
    "the ` faint ` mode data were converted into ` bright2 ` mode and combined to the ` bright ` mode data , to take advantage of the full exposure time and maximize the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "4c  74.26 was observed in 1999 may ( table 1 ) by the  narrow field instruments : the low- and medium - energy concentrator spectrometers , and the phoswich detector system ( hereafter lecs , mecs , and pds , respectively ) .",
    "the data from two of the three mecs units were merged to increase the @xmath11 .",
    "the exposure times resulting from the application of standard screening criteria to account for passage through the south - atlantic anomaly , earth occultation , etc .",

    "the source was detected in the pds band up to energies of order 100  kev , with a count rate of 0.52 @xmath12 0.04 c  s@xmath2 ( table 1 ) .",
    "no bright sources were found in the lecs and mecs fields of view , thus enhancing our confidence that the source detected by the pds is indeed the target quasar .",
    "figure 1 shows the  and  light curves of the three targets .",
    "for pks  234901 and 3c  323.1 , we show the 210  kev light curves from the two  gis detectors combined , binned at 30-minute intervals . for 4c  74.26",

    "no systematic variability is evident in any of the light curves save for a brief , 25% excursion in the case of pks  234901 . to search for short - time scale fluctuations we applied the excess variance test @xcite to the light curves binned at both 256-second and 1800-second intervals .",
    "the excess variance measured from the 256-second light curves is @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for pks  234901 , 3c  323.1 , and 4c  74.26 , respectively .",
    "these values are higher than those of seyfert galaxies of comparable luminosity ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but they are similar to the values found for narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies of comparable luminosity .",
    "the corresponding values of the excess variance for the 1800-second light curves are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 for pks  234901 , 3c  323.1 , and 4c  74.26 , respectively .",
    "the observed fluctuations are unlikely to be related to emission from the jets of these objects because the radio morphology suggests that the the jets are oriented at large angles to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the high - energy light curve of 4c  74.26 , which is rather steady over the course of the observation , in marked contrast to the light curves of blazars .",
    "models were fitted to the  and  spectra using xspec v.11.0.1 @xcite , in the energy ranges where the calibration is well established and the background is low ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the spectra were rebinned such that each new bin contained at least 20 counts in order to validate the use of the @xmath19 statistic .",
    "we used the most current versions of the response matrices and effective area curves ( september 1 , 1997 files for the  instruments ; february 3 , 1995 response matrices for the  gis , and all other calibration files generated specifically for our observations ) .    to check the self - consistency of the spectra obtained by different  detectors",
    ", we first fitted the individual sis and gis spectra .",
    "we then fitted the same model to the spectra from all detectors simultaneously . to take account of any uncalibrated differences between the effective areas of the different instruments",
    ", we allowed the normalization of the corresponding spectra to vary freely .",
    "an analogous procedure was adopted for the spectra from the detectors , as we discuss further below . as with the  spectra",
    ", the normalization constants of spectra from different instruments were also allowed to vary , but the pds normalization was constrained to be between 0.77 and 0.83 of the mecs normalization .",
    "the best - fitting value for the pds / mecs ratio was found to be @xmath20 .",
    "the best - fitting lecs / mecs ratio , which was left free to vary , was @xmath210.02 .",
    "the goals of the spectral analysis are to determine the model that best describes the continuum , including possible excess absorption at low energies and the compton hump at @xmath22  kev , and check for the presence of the  emission line . to determine the best - fitting continuum models , we adopted the following procedure . at first ,",
    "the spectra were fitted by excluding the rest energy range 57  kev , where the  line contributes most .",
    "once the best - fitting continuum model was found , the 57  kev range was added back to the spectra and a gaussian line was added to the model .",
    "this procedure ensures the continuum and the emission line remain unaffected by one another in the fitting process , an especially important concern if the line is broad ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while we investigated the presence of excess absorption at low energies in the three targets , a detailed analysis was possible only in the case of 4c  74.26 , as the lecs sensitivity extends to lower energies than the sis and the spectral calibration is more certain",
    "for each  detector we only use data in the energy range given in table  1 in order to bypass calibration problems associated with the sis efficiency loss at low energies @xcite . excluding the lowest - energy bins in the sis spectra results in larger uncertainties in the determination of the absorbing column , however the column densities turn out to be high enough in both  targets that they can be determined fairly well even by the gis detectors .",
    "the presence of a compton `` reflection '' hump can be determined with confidence only in the  data because of the higher - energy sensitivity of the pds compared to the sis and gis detectors .      the best - fitting model for the  spectra of pks  234901 and 3c  323.1 is an absorbed power law with column density in excess of the galactic value plus a gaussian emission line .",
    "the best - fitting models , parameters , and corresponding error bars ( at 90% confidence for two parameters of interest ) are summarized in table  2 , while the spectra are shown in figure  [ figspec ] with models superposed .",
    "all the models include an absorption component , fixed to the galactic column density , and a second absorption component ( due to neutral gas ) at the source s redshift with the column density left free to vary in the fit .",
    "the implicit assumption of this procedure is that any excess absorption is at the source s rest - frame .",
    "the simple power - law model also provides a good description of the lecs+mecs ( @xmath23  kev ) spectrum of 4c  74.26 but it leaves large residuals at high energies , in the portion of the spectrum sampled by the pds , as shown in figure  [ figspec]c .    it is noteworthy that the absorbing column detected in the spectrum of 4c  74.26 is rather high , namely @xmath24 , a few times higher than what is measured for the other two objects .",
    "analysis of the _ asca _ spectrum of this object by @xcite suggested the presence of an intrinsic , ionized absorber ( `` warm '' absorber ) .",
    "that result , however , was not confirmed in the independent analysis of the same data by @xcite . to investigate this question",
    "further we fitted the lecs spectrum with two different models representing an ionized absorber : ( a ) a single power law with galactic and intrinsic absorption , plus a redshifted absorption edge , and ( b ) an ionized absorber model according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* implemented by the xspec routine absori ) . in neither case",
    "did we find a significant improvement of the fit : the total value of @xmath25 decreases because of the additional free parameters of these more sophisticated absorption models , but the improvement is significant only at the 5065% level ( according to the f - test ) .",
    "our conclusion , therefore , is that although a warm absorber provides an acceptable fit , it is not required by the data .",
    "the high - energy residuals in the simple power - law fit to the spectrum 4c  74.26 indicate the presence of an additional continuum component emerging at energies 10  kev .",
    "the following two possibilities were considered in detail :    1 .",
    "the high - energy excess flux is due to compton `` reflection '' of the primary continuum by neutral , dense matter in the immediate vicinity of the x - ray source @xcite .",
    "thus , we fitted the spectrum with a compton `` reflection '' model ( pexrav within xspec * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this model has several additional free parameters , which include the inclination angle , @xmath26 , of the reprocessing slab relative to the line of sight , the solid angle , @xmath27 , that the slab subtends to the primary x - ray source , and the upper cut - off energy of the primary power - law spectrum . in the particular case of 4c  74.26",
    "we can use the radio properties to constrain the inclination angle of the radio jet ( hence the inclination angle of the disk ) .",
    "the brightness contrast between the small - scale jet and counter - jet ( observed by vlbi ) , if ascribed to relativistic beaming , yields an upper limit to the jet inclination angle of @xmath28 @xcite . requiring that the size of the large - scale radio source does not exceed the size of giant radio sources observed in radio galaxies can yield a lower limit on the inclination .",
    "such giant radio source sizes typically range up to 2.02.5  mpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the radio source in 4c  74.26 is not exceptionally large and adopting 2  mpc as an upper limit to its true size , we obtain @xmath29 .",
    "thus we can express the inclination angle as @xmath30  degrees .. ] in table  2 we give the best fitting model parameters for the case where the inclination angle of the axis of the reprocessing slab was held fixed to the value inferred from the radio morphology . in figure  [ figrefl ]",
    "we show how the inferred reprocessor solid angle depends on the value of the inclination by plotting the 68 , 90 , and 99% confidence contours in the @xmath31 plane . for inclination angles between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which represent the range inferred from the radio properties , the solid angle is consistent with @xmath4 .",
    "the fit with the compton `` reflection '' model is an improvement over the single power law at the 98.7% confidence level , according to the f - test . 2 .",
    "the excess flux could indicate a contribution from the base of the jet .",
    "this was modeled by adding a second power law to the continuum , which did not yield a significantly different description , however , leading us to disfavor this option .",
    "more specifically , the spectral indices of the two power - law components converge to values that are indistinguishable from each other and the total @xmath25 value is higher than the compton `` reflection '' model , which has more free parameters .",
    "moreover , emission from a jet is disfavored by the radio properties of this object ( mainly the morphology ) , which suggest that the jet is oriented at a large angle to the line of sight ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "although the  bandpass is not well - suited to the detection of the compton `` reflection '' continuum , we nevertheless searched for it in the spectra of pks  234901 and 3c  323.1 .",
    "the main reason for embarking on this exercise is that the adopted continuum model could have an influence on the measured properties of the  lines , which we study in the next section ( see the discussion in the context of 4c  74.26 in  3.3 ) . in the case of 3c",
    "323.1 we find no evidence for a compton `` reflection '' continuum .",
    "in fact , a compton `` reflection '' model converges to a model with negligible `` reflection , '' which is in effect the original simple power - law model . in the case of pks  234901 the compton `` reflection '' model results in a slightly lower @xmath25 value than the simple power - law model , but",
    "this apparent improvement is not significant ( the f - test gives a 66% probability of improvement by chance ) .",
    "but the two continuum models yield significantly different properties for the  line , as we describe below .",
    "this effect has been known for some time , and has been discussed by a number of authors , including most recently @xcite .      to search for the presence of an fe  k@xmath5 emission line , which is a ubiquitous feature of the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies , we modeled its profile with a gaussian .",
    "we fitted the continuum as described above and fixed the continuum parameters before adding the gaussian line profile to the model . to evaluate whether the line is unambiguously detected and resolved we searched the 2-dimensional parameter space defined by the line photon flux and the energy dispersion of the gaussian profile .",
    "the results of this search are shown in figure  [ figlines ] in the form of confidence contours in the line ew @xmath35 fwhm plane ( the ew and fwhm are directly proportional to the line photon flux and gaussian energy dispersion , respectively ) .",
    "these results are also summarized in table  3 .    in the case of 4c  74.26",
    "the line is clearly detected with a rest ew of @xmath36  ev .",
    "the energy of the fe  k@xmath5 emission line encompasses the range 6.4 to 6.9  kev within 90% confidence .",
    "thus , we confirm the detection of the line in 4c  74.26 with , as reported by @xcite and @xcite . in the case of 3c  323.1",
    "the line is only marginally detected , i.e. , its ew is non - zero at 90% confidence but consistent with zero at 99% confidence ( for an assumed energy of 6.4  kev ) .",
    "the best - fitting fwhm is about @xmath37 , which is comparable with what is found in seyfert galaxies by @xcite .    in the case of pks  234901",
    ", the measured properties of the line depend sensitively on the continuum model .",
    "if we adopt a simple power - law model , the line is unambiguously detected at the 99% confidence level with a rest ew of @xmath3  ev and a fwhm of @xmath38 . if , however , we adopt a model consisting of a power - law plus compton `` reflection , '' fixing the solid angle of the reprocessor to @xmath39 , the line is about a factor of 2 weaker ( see table  3 ) . if we fix the solid angle of the reprocessor to @xmath40 , its maximum physically reasonable value , the line is only marginally detected ( at the 68% confidence level ) .",
    "the upper limit to its rest ew is 200  ev , assuming a fwhm of @xmath41 .",
    "this ambiguity can not be resolved with the data at hand . in order to measure the properties of the fe  k@xmath5 lines with confidence , we need either a 210  kev spectrum of much higher @xmath11 or a spectrum of comparable @xmath11 extending to at least 30  kev , which can yield meaningful constraints on the properties of the compton `` reflection '' component .",
    "finally , we also note that the observed ews of the fe  k@xmath5 lines and the strength of the compton `` reflection '' components are consistent with each other , albeit within the large uncertainties , as one would expect in the context of reprocessing models such as those of @xcite .",
    "such models attribute the origin of both the fe  k@xmath5 line and the compton `` reflection '' component to the same reprocessing medium and require that their strengths are related .      our preferred model for 4c  74.26 consists of a power - law continuum modified by compton `` reflection '' at high energies and by absorption at low energies .",
    "the line energy obtained from the model could not be tightly contrained , falling between 6.4 and 6.9  kev at a 90% confidence level . within uncertainties ,",
    "our results are largely consistent with the results of @xcite , who considered our preferred model among others .",
    "however , there is a systematic discrepancy between the properties of the fe  k@xmath5 line , which we attribute to the continuum fit used by @xcite .",
    "more specifically we find that the line is several times broader and about 70% stronger than what @xcite found .",
    "comparing the parameters describing the continuum , we see that the compton `` reflection '' component in the _ asca _ spectrum of brinkmann et al .",
    "is poorly constrained and has an extremely high value that implies the reprocessor subtends an area larger than 3 times the area of the sky .",
    "although this could be interpreted as an indication that the primary x - ray source does not emit isotropically , it is also possible that the strength of the compton `` reflection '' component was overestimated .",
    "such poor constraints on the compton `` reflection '' component are not surprising , since the  sensitivity drops dramatically at @xmath42  kev , making it practically impossible to measure this component .",
    "thus , the continuum around the fe  k@xmath5 line is elevated , taking away the broad wings of the line and reducing its overall strength .",
    "in contrast , in our  spectrum we are able to determine the shape of the high - energy continuum unambiguously with the help of the pds .",
    "we find a considerably weaker compton `` reflection '' strength than @xcite and a correspondingly broader and stronger fe  k@xmath5 line .    in view of the strength of the compton `` reflection '' component measured from the  spectrum ,",
    "we re - analyzed the the spectra to check for consistency .",
    "we extracted and fitted the spectra with the same methodology described in  2 and  3 , keeping the compton `` reflection '' component fixed to a strength corresponding to @xmath39 , as measured from the  spectrum .",
    "we measured the ew of the fe  k@xmath5 line for fixed rest energies of 6.4 and 6.7  kev .",
    "we found that the measurements from the  spectra are consistent with those from the  spectrum .",
    "in particular , we measure a spectral index of @xmath43 , while the fe  k@xmath5 rest ew is poorly constrained and lies in the range 130700 ev , as listed in table  3 .",
    "we have presented new  and  observations of three luminous ( @xmath44 ) radio - loud agn , as part of our ongoing systematic study of the x - ray properties of such objects .",
    "we find that in all three cases the main underlying continuum can be described as a power law with photon index @xmath45 , plus excess absorption . in two sources ( pks  234901 and 4c  74.26 )",
    "the  emission line is detected with rest - frame @xmath46 200  ev but with large uncertainties , of a factor of 2 ; in 4c  74.26 the line is unresolved while in pks  234901 the line properties depend on the model adopted for the continuum . in 4c  74.26 , a strong ( @xmath47 ) compton `` reflection '' component is also detected with the pds instrument on . in pks  234901 ,",
    "on the other hand , the data allow the presence of a compton `` reflection '' component but can not provide meaningful constraints on its strength .",
    "this is unfortunate because the strength of this component affects the inferred properties of the  line dramatically , as we explained in detail in  3.2 .",
    "the average photon index for the three sources studied here is @xmath48 with a small dispersion of @xmath49 .",
    "the average slope of the x - ray continuum is consistent with the average photon index previously measured with  for a small sample of 7 qsrs of comparable luminosity , which had @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the average slope for a sample of radio - quiet quasars from  measurements , @xmath48 and dispersion @xmath52 ( see table  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "the similarity of slopes for the radio - loud and radio - quiet sources confirms that no contribution from the beamed emission of an unresolved jet is present in the radio - loud qsrs of our study ( as expected based on their radio morphology , see above )",
    ". it also suggests a similar continuum emission process in the two classes of agn . this result will need to be confirmed using larger samples of both radio - loud and radio - quiet sources",
    "moreover , a wider spectral coverage will also be needed in order to constrain the strength of the compton `` reflection '' hump and disentangle its effects from the slope of the intrinsic continuum .",
    "another result of this paper is the excess absorption found in all three objects . in 4c  74.26 ,",
    "where the observed spectra extend to low energies , we have searched for the signature of a warm absorber , but have not found conclusive evidence for it , nor were we able to rule it out .",
    "there are two possible origins for the excess absorption .",
    "the first is local excess absorption in the galaxy . as 4c  74.26",
    "lies at relatively low latitudes ( @xmath53 ) , it is conceivable that the extra absorption is associated with a galactic molecular cloud .",
    "alternatively , the absorber could be intrinsic to the source .",
    "in pks  234901 and 3c  323.1 , the absorber is most likely intrinsic to the source because of their high galactic latitudes .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier findings @xcite that excess neutral absorption is common in radio - loud agn and the absorbing column does not appear to be correlated with the x - ray luminosity of the source ( these three objects fall in the general area occupied by radio - loud agns in the @xmath54 plot shown in figure  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "we have also detected an  emission line in two ( possibly three ) sources of our sample . in order to compare the strengths of these lines with what is found in other radio - loud and radio - quiet agns we plotted the rest ews against the 210  kev luminosity in figure  [ figewlx ] .",
    "this is an update of the figure presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data points represent radio - loud agns ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and this paper ) .",
    "the shaded area represents the `` x - ray baldwin effect '' for radio - quiet seyferts and qsos and its 90% dispersion @xcite .",
    "while at @xmath55 radio - loud agns have systematically lower  ews than radio - quiet agns of comparable luminosity , the situation at higher luminosities is quite unclear because of the large uncertainties in the measured ews .",
    "there are two possible ways of viewing figure  [ figewlx ] : either ( a ) radio - loud agns follow their own `` x - ray baldwin effect , '' which is systematically offset from that of radio - quiet agns , or ( b ) radio - loud agns do not show a baldwin effect at all .",
    "unfortunately , the large uncertainties in the measured ews , especially at high luminosities , do not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "better measurements of the  ews of luminous radio - loud agns ( @xmath56 ) are sorely needed .",
    "the x - ray baldwin effect for radio - quiet agn was interpreted by @xcite as the result of a progressive ionization of the inner accretion disk as the x - ray luminosity increases .",
    "we speculate that the lack of a similar trend for radio - loud agn indicates that the ionization structure of the disk of radio - loud agns does not change significantly as the x - ray luminosity increases .",
    "this could happen , for example , in a scenario where the dense , optically thick matter in the disk is photoionized by external illumination with a hard spectrum of low ionization parameter .",
    "if the ionization parameter in the emitting region is extremely low , changes in the ionizing luminosity even by an order of magnitude are accompanied by a proportional increase in the line luminosity .",
    "this would be the case if the central accretion disk is an adaf ( or similar structure ) which has a low radiative efficiency and produces an x - ray luminosity that is disproportionately low compared to the accretion rate and a relatively hard spectrum .",
    "ionization of the geometrically thin disk exterior to the adaf by hard x - rays from the adaf itself would thus produce the desired effect .",
    "the above picture is supported by a number of other observational results , namely the systematically lower  ews and fwhms and weaker compton `` reflection '' humps of radio - loud agns compared to their radio - quiet counterparts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". both of these differences can be understood in the context of a scenario in which the inner accretion disk is an adaf rather than a geometrically thin and optically thick flow .",
    "the difference in  ews and compton `` reflection '' strengths is then a geometrical effect resulting from the small solid angle subtended by the outer disk to the primary x - ray source @xcite .",
    "the difference in fwhm follows simply from kepler s law .    to make further progress on this problem ,",
    "more and better hard x - ray spectra of radio - loud agn are needed , especially at high luminosity .",
    "the ideal instrument for this job is .",
    "these spectra will serve to test the x - ray baldwin effect for this class of objects .",
    "an independent test of the above hypothesis will be afforded by the profiles of the  lines , which would be expected to be significantly different in width and asymmetry from those of seyfert galaxies .",
