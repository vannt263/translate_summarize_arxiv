    "neutrino physics is now playing a pivotal role to probe physics beyond the standard model .",
    "confirmation of tiny neutrino masses as well as nonzero mixing angles have thrown light on the structure of the leptonic sector . in the quest towards understanding of a viable texture of neutrino mass matrix popular paradigm is to advocate flavor symmetries , directly associated with some gauge group .",
    "on the other hand , there are some other ansatzs which also give rise to interesting phenomenological consequences , although their origin from a symmetry discrete or continuous are yet to be established at the present moment . + in the present work we bring together two ideas to explore the neutrino phenomenology , particularly , to generate large @xmath2 @xcite-@xcite as reported by recent experiments @xcite-@xcite as well as cp violation and baryogenesis via leptogenesis . in this scheme",
    "we consider 0.1 in a ) scaling ansatz@xcite-@xcite , 0.1 in b ) four zero texture @xcite-@xcite of dirac neutrino matrix @xmath3 , 0.1 in within the framework of type i seesaw mechanism denoted as @xmath4 where @xmath0 is a @xmath5 right chiral neutrino mass matrix and we consider the basis in which charged lepton and @xmath0 are flavor diagonal . 0.1 in scaling ansatz @xcite-@xcite posses a distinctive feature that the texture is invariant under renormalisation group evolution unlike other symmetries such as @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "basically , the ansatz correlates the elements of neutrino mass matrix through a scale factor and it can be implemented in different ways . although the theoretical origin of such ansatz is not yet well known , however , this ansatz can be approximated as @xmath7 symmetry ( i.e @xmath8 symmetry in the left handed neutrinos ) with the value of the scale factor unity .",
    "furthermore , it leads to inverted hierarchy of neutrino mass with @xmath9 = 0 , and @xmath2 = 0 .",
    "thus , it is obvious to break such ansatz in order to generate nonzero @xmath2 . 0.1 in the other assumption that occurrence of four zeroes in @xmath1 gives rise to a more constrained feature that the phases contributing to the high scale cp violation required for leptogenesis ( basically the phases of @xmath10 matrix ) are determined in terms of the low energy cp violating phases ( i.e phases of @xmath11 ) . 0.1 in we divide all the @xmath12 four zero textures in the following classes : 0.1 in i ) det(@xmath1)= 0 and no generation decouples : @xmath13 textures 0.1 in ii ) det(@xmath1 ) @xmath14 0 and no generation decouples : @xmath15 textures . 0.1 in iii)det(@xmath1)= 0 and one generation decouples : @xmath16 textures 0.1 in iv )",
    "det(@xmath1 ) @xmath17 and one generation decouples : @xmath18 textures 0.1 in the textures belong to class ( ii ) are already studied extensively @xcite-@xcite . class ( iii ) and ( iv ) are incompatible with the neutrino experimental result . the remaining class , class ( i ) , which is yet to be explored , posses one zero eigenvalue which is still allowed by the present experiments .",
    "the interesting point is to note that if we insert scaling ansatz to all four zero textures and consider those textures in which four zero remain four zero and no generation decouples , we see that the survived textures are only from class ( i ) . motivated with this unique selection property of scaling ansatz , in the present work we investigate textures belong to class ( i ) .",
    "in addition to one eigenvalue zero , scaling ansatz also dictates one mixing angle to be zero .",
    "we further generate nonzero @xmath2 through the breaking of scaling ansatz due to a small perturbation parameter in @xmath1 .",
    "we investigate all possible cases and finally we demonstrate that the broken scaling ansatz textures remain invariant under renormalization group ( rg ) evolution . +",
    "our plan of this paper is as follows : in section ii we discuss different types of scaling ansatz and allowed four zero textures .",
    "section iii contains parametrization and diagonalisation of neutrino mass matrix . breaking of scaling ansatz and generation of nonzero @xmath2",
    "are discussed in section iv .",
    "numerical results are given in section v and section vi contains the possible baryogenesis via leptogenesis scenario arises in those textures and summary of the present work is given in section vii .",
    "discussion on rg effect is given in apendix a and explicit expressions arise in section iv are included in appendix b.",
    "several authors @xcite-@xcite have been studied scaling ansatz through its implementation along the columns of effective @xmath11 matrix . in the present work",
    ", we consider this ansatz at a more fundamental level of @xmath19 @xcite and we find that implementation of this ansatz along the rows of @xmath19 with a diagonal @xmath20 effectively gives rise to the same structure of @xmath11 @xcite after invoking type - i seesaw mechanism . according to this ansatz elements of a row ( of 3@xmath213 @xmath19 ) are connected with the elements of another row through a definite scale factor . in case of 3@xmath213 @xmath19",
    "there are three types of this ansatz which are given as follows : + i@xmath22 second and third row are related through a complex scale factor @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is column index , @xmath26 . invoking type i seesaw mechanism @xmath27 with @xmath28 we obtain the following scaling relations in @xmath29 @xmath30 we discard the other two cases where the scale factor relates ii@xmath22 first and third row and iii@xmath22 first and second row because in those cases either @xmath31 or @xmath32 is zero at the leading order .",
    "we start with a general scaling ansatz invariant @xmath1 matrix on which we will assume four zeroes and explore all the possibilities .",

    "we find that out of 126 four zero textures , imposition of scaling ansatz reduces drastically the number to only 12 . 0.1 in 2 .",
    "we ignore category b because it is not possible to break scaling ansatz keeping the pattern of @xmath1 matrices unaltered .",
    "let us assume the breaking is incorporated as @xmath61 , the structure of all @xmath1 remain same and still invariant under scaling ansatz .",
    "thus , to break scaling ansatz in category b , we have to have reduce the number of zeroes which is beyond our proposition . 0.1 in 3 .",
    "we also discard all the textures in category c since one generation is completely decoupled from the other two which give rise to two mixing angles zero .",
    "hence , the number of surviving texture is only six and all of them are from class ( i ) described previously in the section i. 0.1 in for category a as the second and third row of the matrices are connected through a scale factor , from now on we express them as follows 0.1 in @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath23 are all complex parameters .",
    "0.1 in we parametrize the @xmath29 matrix arises after seesaw for all @xmath1 matrices in category a in a generic way as @xmath67 with the definitions of the parameters for six consecutive cases as @xmath68 considering complex @xmath23 as @xmath69 and @xmath70 as @xmath71 , we rotate the matrix @xmath29 by @xmath72 from both sides and get the @xmath29 free from redundant phases as @xmath73 where @xmath74 here @xmath70 , @xmath23 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 all are real positive parameters .",

    "+ four zero structure is also retained .",
    "+   + the second assumption rules out all category b textures as we have mentioned earlier . breaking of scaling ansatz can only be incorporated in the remaining six four zero textures in category a and after breaking the scaling ansatz by a dimensionless real parameter @xmath102 their structure come out as follows @xmath103 theses structures of @xmath1 are free from rg effects which we have discussed in appendix - a . moreover , the breaking considered here are the most general which can be understood as follows : consider the matrix @xmath104 in which the breaking scheme is incorporated as @xmath105 while @xmath106 now , redefining the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 it is equivalent to break the ansatz in @xmath109 and @xmath110 elements .",
