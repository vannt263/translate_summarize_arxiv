    "the distribution of solar activity over the surface of the sun and its change in the course of the 11-year solar cycle represents one of the crucial points for the development of solar dynamo models .",
    "the latitudinal distribution of sunspots has a long history of investigation ; it is one of the most frequently studied features of the solar cycle ( see , and references therein ) .",
    "sprer was one of the first researchers who discovered the existence of the sunspot - generating zones and described the regularity of their development . according to sprer s law , discovered by r.c .",
    "carrington ( ) , the mean latitude of sunspot groups gradually decreases from the beginning to the end of the 11-year cycle of solar activity , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sunspot - generating zone moves from mid - heliolatitudes toward the solar equator .",
    "the characteristics of the latitude migration of sunspot groups in the northern and southern hemispheres were investigated from 1874 to 1999 ( ) .",
    "it was found that the latitude migration - velocity of sunspot groups is highest at the beginning of a solar cycle , and as the solar cycle progresses , it decreases with time , with an average of about @xmath10 during a solar cycle . near minimum",
    "the centroid position of the sunspot areas is about @xmath11 from the equator .",
    "the equatorward drift ceases late in the cycle at about @xmath12 from the equator ( ) . the sunspot zone latitudes and equatorward drift measured relative to the starting time ( near solar minima ) follow a standard path for all cycles that does not depend upon the cycle strength or hemispheric dominance .",
    "the width of the sunspot zone and its connection to the solar cycle was studied in , and .",
    "the active latitude bands are narrow at minimum , expand to a greatest width at the time of maximum , and then narrow again during the declining phase of the cycle .",
    "the latitude extension of the sunspot - generating zone is closely related to the current level of solar activity .",
    "the latitude distribution of solar activity from 1874 to 2004 was studied by , who calculated the latitudinal moments of the sunspot group areas .",
    "close relationships between the total strength of the sunspot cycle , the mean latitudes of the sunspots and the width of the sunspot zones were found .",
    "a clear asymmetry was seen between the two hemispheres : the range of variability from cycle to cycle in total area , mean latitude , and width was less in the southern hemisphere and the correlations between total area and mean latitude and total area and width were stronger in the southern hemisphere . according to , large - amplitude cycles reach their maxima sooner than medium- or small - amplitude cycles ( the waldmeier effect ; , @xcite ) . thus , the sunspot zone latitude at the maximum of a large cycle will be higher simply because the maximum occurs earlier and the sunspot zones are still at higher latitudes .",
    "polar faculae present one more example of solar activity concentrating around a certain range of heliolatitudes .",
    "polar faculae are visible on white - light images that have been obtained daily at the mount wilson observatory since 1906 .",
    "estimates of the number of faculae in the vicinity of the north and south poles were obtained for the interval 19061964 ( ) , and then updated twice , first through 1975 and then through 1990 ( , @xcite ) .",
    "the third update with an extensive review of measurement techniques and observed results includes observations through the spring of 2007 ( see ) .",
    "the number of faculae at the north pole was counted for images obtained during the interval of 15 august ",
    "15 september , when the north pole is most visible ( for the south pole the corresponding interval was 15 february  15 march ) .",
    "another procedure , which was adopted to determine the number of the polar faculae , was used by for images selected from the kislovodsk solar station collections ( 19601994 ) .",
    "the observed number of polar faculae was corrected depending on the distance from the center of the disk and on the season by means of empirical visibility functions .",
    "the visibility functions for the north and south hemispheres were derived by assuming that there is no seasonal variation in the distribution of the polar - facula number for 19601994 .",
    "the zone of the emergence of polar faculae migrates poleward during the period between the two successive polarity reversals of the solar magnetic field ( ) . during the period from 1970 to 1978 the mean latitude of the zone where polar faculae emerge",
    "increased from @xmath13 ( 1970 ) to @xmath14 ( 1978 ) in each hemisphere .",
    "the last polar faculae were observed in the second half of 1978 at latitudes from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "polar faculae appear at higher latitudes than sunspots and precede sunspots in their development by approximately six years ( ) .",
    "another study ( ) showed that polar faculae lead the sunspot number by 52 months .",
    "polar facular measurements are in excellent agreement with polar magnetic flux estimates and allow studying the evolution of the polar magnetic field ( ) . a strong correlation between the heliospheric magnetic field ( hmf ) and the polar flux at solar minimum was found , whereas during periods of activity the hmf showed a good correlation with the square root of the sunspot area .",
    "all manifestations of solar activity are closely connected to the magnetic field of the sun and its cyclic changes .",
    "butterfly diagrams of the magnetic flux are a common way of studying the large - scale evolution of the sun s magnetism .",
    "in such a diagram , the flux is averaged over a full rotation and plotted as a function of the mid - time of the rotation and latitude .",
    "averaged the magnetic field as a function of latitude over each solar rotation for 24 years of magnetic observations from mt .",
    "the obtained diagram was used for comparison with the dynamo model of .",
    "the agreement between the model and the observations was quite striking , although some deficiencies of the model were found .",
    "the evolution of the zonal solar magnetic field from mid-1976 to mid-1990 was studied by using the wilcox solar observatory ( wso ) magnetograms .",
    "the absolute value of the flux at each latitude was averaged for each carrington rotation .",
    "the total flux is closely related to the level of activity and resembles the butterfly diagram of the sunspot location .",
    "at the solar minima the total flux at all latitudes was low .",
    "about a year after minimum the flux level rose at mid - latitudes and expanded rapidly .",
    "the peak - flux latitude gradually moved toward the equator in each hemisphere .",
    "the polar flux was strongest near solar minimum ( ) .",
    "the features of variations over time , latitude , and height of magnetic fields in @xmath17 latitudinal zones of the sun from the photosphere to the source surface were studied by . a strong difference between variations of the low- and high - latitude total fields was found . at latitudes lower than @xmath18 in the large - scale field ,",
    "the contribution comes from magnetic fields of active regions , plages and sunspots , in addition to the contribution of the background fields .",
    "variations over time of the total magnetic field in the photosphere at low latitudes are similar to variations of the wolf numbers . in the polar regions",
    "the contribution of strong fields is negligible . at latitudes of @xmath13 and higher",
    ", the cyclical character of the variation of the total field is small .",
    "magnetic fields of different magnitudes correspond to different manifestations of the activity of the sun .",
    "the following problems are of interest : the study of the latitudinal distribution of the solar magnetic fields for the whole range of magnetic field strengths , the selection of magnetic field groups connected to certain ranges of heliolatitude , and the comparison of these field groups with different manifestations of the solar activity .",
    "a novel feature of the present work is that we study the latitudinal distribution of the photospheric magnetic fields obtained by averaging the data over @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we do not consider the time - dependency of the latitudinal distribution and study only those characteristics that persist even after averaging over three solar cycles .    in section 2",
    "we describe the data and discuss the method applied in this article .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of the latitudinal distribution for groups of magnetic fields of different strength .",
    "the connection of these groups to certain manifestations of the solar activity is considered . in section 4",
    "the main conclusions are drawn .",
    "for this study we used synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field produced at the nso / kp ( available at http://nsokp.nso.edu ) .",
    "these data cover the period from 1975 to 2003 ( carrington rotations @xmath20 ) .",
    "because the data have many gaps during the initial observation periods , we included the data starting from carrington rotation 1646 in our analysis .",
    "synoptic maps have the following spatial resolution : @xmath21 in longitude ( 360 steps ) , 180 equal steps in the sine of the latitude from @xmath22 ( south pole ) to @xmath23 ( north pole ) .",
    "thus , every map consists of @xmath24 pixels of magnetic - flux values .    on the assumption that the fields are radial to the solar surface ,",
    "the average line - of - sight component from the original observations was divided by the cosine of the heliocentric angle ( the angle between the line of sight and the vertical direction ) and transformed into units of gauss .",
    "noisy values near the poles were detected and replaced by a cubic spline fit to valid values in the polar regions .",
    "although the instrumental noise _ per _ resolution element is reduced by the map construction process , the maps tend to be noisy at the poles because of noisy measurements associated with the limb and the relatively small number of original measurements that cover the poles .",
    "some of the issues related to the noise in the kitt peak measurements of the polar magnetic field are discussed in . each year",
    ", for the period of 19861990 , the noise increased toward the limb .",
    "the calculations of the noise level show that measurements in the region with a viewing angle larger than @xmath16 can not be considered reliable . in the sine of the latitude representation of the kitt peak data",
    ", only one latitude zone corresponds to the range @xmath25 .",
    "the nso / kp data are complete in the sense that where observational data are missing , such as when the tilt of the sun s axis to the ecliptic causes one of the polar regions to be invisible , interpolated values are used ( ) .",
    "strong magnetic fields of both polarities occupy a relatively small part of the sun s surface .",
    "the magnetic - field strength for the period @xmath19 shows a nearly symmetric distribution with 60.3% of the strength values in the @xmath26 g range , whereas pixels with a magnetic strength above @xmath27 g occupy only 3.3% of the solar surface .",
    "magnetic fields in the @xmath28 g and @xmath29 g strength ranges occupy 26.9% and 9.5% , respectively .",
    "we used the summation of synoptic maps over the period of nearly three solar cycles ( cycles @xmath0 ) to obtain one averaged synoptic map for the whole period under consideration . in figure  [ summethod ] the scheme of the summation is presented . by averaging the resulting map over the longitude , we obtain the latitudinal profile of the magnetic flux for the period from 1976 to 2003 .",
    "our main goal is to compare the summary synoptic maps and the latitudinal profiles for different groups of magnetic fields .",
    ".,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    to give an idea of the characteristics of the data we used and of the order of magnitude of the magnetic fluxes , we show the change of the magnetic flux for years @xmath19 in figure  [ totalflux ] , evaluated for each synoptic map and then averaged using running means over 20 rotations .",
    "the photospheric magnetic flux changes in phase with the solar activity .",

    "the flux in the sunspot zone considerably exceeds the flux in the polar facular zone",
    ".    it should be mentioned that some very low ( background ) flux exists at each latitude ( approximately @xmath30 g ) .",
    "the maximum in the sunspot zone exceeds the background flux by five times .",
    "one can note that the total flux averaged over three cycles for the southern hemisphere exceeds the flux in the northern hemisphere .    .",

    "concentrations of the magnetic field are observed in the sunspot zone and at the latitudes characteristic of polar faculae.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]",
    "when studying the latitudinal distributions of magnetic fields of different magnitude , we discovered that there are four characteristic groups of fields .",
    "these are fields with strengths in ranges of @xmath26 g , @xmath28 g , @xmath29 g , and @xmath31 g .",
    "magnetic fields in each of the groups have common latitudinal distribution features , while for different field groups these features change significantly .",
    "each of the groups is closely related to a certain manifestation of the solar activity .    to study the latitudinal distribution of these groups we obtained separate summary magnetic field maps for each of the above field ranges .",
    "before the summation , each synoptic map was transformed in such a way that only the pixels in the field strength range under consideration are taken into account .",
    "namely , the value of @xmath32 for each pixel was replaced by 1 or 0 according to whether @xmath32 fell into the @xmath33 range or not .",
