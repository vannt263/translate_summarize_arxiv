    "in many recent astrophysical applications of the theory of dense matter it is necessary to investigate the properties of rapidly rotating compact objects within general relativity theory .",
    "the reason for this development is the hope that changes in the internal structure of the dense matter , e.g. during phase transitions , could have observable consequences for the dynamics of the rotational behavior of these objects .",
    "particular examples are the observations of glitches and postglitch relaxation in pulsars which are discussed as signals for superfluidity in nuclear matter ( pines & ali alpar 1992 ) and the suggestion that the braking index is remarkably enhanced when a quark matter core occurs in the centre of a pulsar during its spin - down evolution ( glendenning et al .",
    "further constraints for the nuclear equation of state come from the observation of quasi - periodic brightness oscillations ( qpo s ) in low - mass x - ray binaries which entail mass and radius limits for rapidly rotating neutron stars , see @xcite .",

    "1994 ) the method of perturbation theory ( hartle 1967 , sedrakian & chubarian 1968 ) is a physically transparent and systematic approach to the solution of the problem of stationary gravitational fields and their sources .",
    "this approach has been applied successfully in general relativity as well as in alternative theories of gravitation ( grigorian & chubarian 1985 ) .    from a practical point of view in the definition of the integral characteristics of the astrophysical objects ,",
    "it is important to analyze the asymptotical expansion of the metric tensor at large distances from the stars , to be able to compare the results with observational data .",
    "one can of course introduce the physical parameters of the configuration using the symmetry properties of the object and the gravitational field by expressing them in terms of conserved quantities . in this work we use the definition of the @xmath1 projection of the angular momentum of the nonspherical rotating star ( z is the axis of the star s rotation and symmetry of the gravitational field ) as a conserved integral of motion .",
    "it is a well known integral of the non diagonal element of the energy - momentum tensor in the frame of spherical coordinates .    using the method of perturbation theory",
    ", we are going to calculate the total mass , angular momentum and shape deformation from the solution of the gravitational field equations in case of hydrodynamical , thermodynamical and chemical equilibrium for a given total baryon number and angular velocity @xmath2 of the object . according to @xcite",
    "the expansion parameter is of the order of the ratio of the rotational and gravitational energy .",
    "it has been shown that , for compact objects in the stationary rotating regime without matter flux , the first two terms of the series expansion give a sufficiently good approximation ( see also glendenning 1997 , weber 1999 ) .",
    "the evolution of the rotating stars could have different origins and scenarii .",

    "the physical characteristics of the rotating object depend on the centrifugal forces in the local inertial frame of the observer .",

    "we assume that the star due to high viscosity ( ignoring the super - fluid component of the matter ) rotates stationarily as a solid body with an angular velocity @xmath2 that is independent of the spatial coordinates .",
    "the time scales for changes in the angular velocity which we will consider in our applications are well separated from the relaxation times at which hydrodynamical equilibrium is established , so that the assumption of a rigid rotator model is justified .",

    "the change from spin - down to spin - up behaviour during the pulsar evolution signals the deconfinement transition .",
    "when the pulsar has developed a quark matter core then the change of the moment of inertia due to further mass accretion is negligible and has no longer influence on the pulsar timing .",
    "however , in real systems the transfer of angular momentum from the accreting matter can lead to a spin - up already . then the transition to the quark matter core regime",
    "should be observable as an increase in the spin - up rate .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate in the future whether e.g. low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) with mass accretion might be discussed as possible candidates for rapidly rotating neutron stars for which consequences of the transition to the quark core regime due to mass accretion might be detected .",
    "recently , quasi - periodic brightness oscillations ( qpo s ) with frequences up to @xmath167 hz have been observed ( lamb et al .",
    "1998 ) which entail new mass and radius constraints for compact objects .",
    "note in this context that the assumption of a deconfined matter interior of the compact star in some lmxbs as e.g. sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( li et al . 1999 ) seems to be more consistent than that of an ordinary hadronic matter interior .",
    "it has been demonstrated , through the example of the deconfinement transition from hadronic to quark matter , that the rotational characteristics of neutron stars ( braking index , spin - down rate ) are sensitive to changes of their inner structure and can thus be investigated in order to detect structural phase transitions .",
    "the theoretical basis for the present work was a perturbation method for the solution of the einstein equations for axial symmetry which allows us to calculate the contribution of different rotational effects to the change of the moment of inertia .",
    "this quantity can be used as a tool for the investigation of the changes in the rotation timing for different scenarios of the neutron star evolution .",
    "the deviation of the braking index from the value @xmath0 ( magnetic dipole radiation ) as a function of the angular velocity has been suggested as a possible signal for the deconfinement transition and the occurrence of a quark matter core in pulsars .",
    "we have reinvestigated this signal within our approach and could show that the magnitude of this deviation is correlated with the size of the quark core , since the influence of the @xmath168 phase crust on such processes is negligible .    for neutron stars with mass accretion ,",
    "we have suggested that under the assumption of total angular momentum conservation a flip from spin - down to spin - up behaviour signals the appearance of a quark matter core .",
    "a more detailed investigation is necessary to identify possible candidates of rotating compact objects with mass accretion ( see e.g. @xcite ) for which the suggested deconfinement signal could be relevant .",
    "although the quantitative details of the reported deconfinement signals are quite model - dependent and might change when one uses more realistic equations of state , e.g. including the strangeness degree of freedom ( glendenning et al .",
    "1997 , weber 1999 ) , the relation between the magnitude of the effect and the size of the quark core which has been found here is expected to be model - independent and should be confirmed by subsequent studies .",

    "<S> using the formalism of general relativity for axially symmetric gravitational fields and their sources - rotating compact stars - a perturbation theory with respect to angular velocity is developed and physical quantities such as mass , shape , momentum of inertia and total energy of the star are defined . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the internal structure of the star due to rotation has been investigated and the different contributions to the moment of inertia have been evaluated separately . </S>",
    "<S> numerical solutions have been performed using a two - flavor model equation of state describing the deconfinement phase transition as constrained by the conservation of total baryon number and electric charge . during the spin down evolution of the rotating neutron star , below critical values of angular velocity </S>",
    "<S> a quark matter core can appear which might be detected as a characteristic signal in the pulsar timing . within the spin - down scenario due to magnetic dipole radiation </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the deviation of the braking index from @xmath0 could signal not only the occurrence but also the size of a quark core in the pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> a new scenario is proposed where , due to mass accretion onto the rapidly rotating compact star , a spin - down to spin - up transition might signal a deconfinement transition in its interior . </S>"
