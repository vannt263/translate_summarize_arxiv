    "there has been considerable recent interest in the modelling of astronomical and cosmological gravitational wave sources .",
    "this interest has been spurred on by the recent and upcoming construction of both ground and space based gravitational wave observatories .",
    "ground based detectors such as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite and geo600 @xcite have already reached the data collection phase.the primary space based gravitational wave observatory , lisa @xcite - the laser interferometer space antenna - is still in the design and planning phase . a joint nasa / esa mission , it is expected to launch within the next few years .",
    "it will detect gravitational waves in the frequency band 0.1 - 0.0001hz , a band in which a considerable number of interesting gravitational wave sources are expected to be found .    in order to extract the maximum amount of information from these gravitational wave detectors ,",
    "data analysis techniques such as matched filtering may be employed . to improve the effectiveness of this data analysis , it is necessary to have accurate predictions of the waveforms of the gravitational radiation emitted by candidate sources .",
    "one of the primary candidate sources of such a gravitational wave signal falls under the category of large mass binary systems .",
    "in particular , extreme mass ratio systems such as that of a compact solar mass object ( mass @xmath0 ) inspiralling into a black hole of @xmath1 to @xmath2 solar masses ( mass @xmath3 ) are expected to be detectable by lisa out to gpc distances .    as a prerequisite to the calculation of the waveform",
    "templates for such sources , it is necessary to model the orbital evolution of the system . in the case of extreme mass ratio systems",
    ", we can do so by making the approximation that the smaller mass is travelling in the background spacetime of the larger mass .",
    "however , the compact nature of the smaller mass means that it itself will distort the curvature of the spacetime in which it is moving to a non - negligible extent . as a result",
    ", it does not follow a geodesic of the background spacetime of the larger mass , but rather , it follows a geodesic of the total spacetime of both masses . in this sense the motion of the smaller mass is affected by the presence of its own mass , i.e. the smaller mass is seen to exert a force on itself .",
    "this is called the self - force .",
    "clearly , the computation of this self - force is of fundamental importance to the accurate calculation of the orbital evolution of such binary systems and hence to the prediction of the gravitational radiation waveform .    because of this non - linear behavior",
    ", it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to exactly solve the equations of motion of such a system .",
    "however , due to the extreme mass ratio involved , the deviation of the object s trajectory from the background geodesic is small over sufficiently small time - scales ( less than the natural length - scale of the background ) . in this case , to linear order in @xmath0 , we can model the deviation from the background as a spin-2 field generated by the particle and living on the background spacetime .",
    "this field is then seen to couple to the smaller object to cause the self - force .    in the present work",
    ", we will focus not on the gravitational self - force described thus far , but rather on the analogous but simpler scalar self - force . instead of considering the smaller mass , @xmath0 , to be generating a gravitational field ,",
    "we take it to have a scalar charge , @xmath4 .",
    "this charge couples to a massless scalar field which is then the cause of the self - force . otherwise , we leave the problem exactly as posed above . in making this change ,",
    "the resulting analysis remains extremely similar to the gravitational case , but the algebraic details of the calculations become simpler .",
    "this will allow us to explore the problem and develop techniques which we will at a later date apply to the physically more interesting gravitational case .",
    "an expression for the electromagnetic self - force was originally obtained by dewitt and brehme @xcite ( later corrected by hobbs @xcite ) and more recently recovered by quinn and wald @xcite .",
    "in addition , ref .",
    "@xcite derives an expression for the gravitational self - force , as was done previously by mino , sasaki and tanaka @xcite . using a generalization of his axiomatic approach",
    ", quinn also obtained an expression for the scalar self - force @xcite .",
    "these results show how the self - force may be expressed in terms of an integral of the retarded green s function over the entire past world - line of the particle .",
    "this retarded green s function possesses two terms , one representing geodesic propagation , the other a tail - term arising from back - scattering by the spacetime geometry .",
    "( solutions to wave equations on most curved manifolds depend not only on cauchy data directly intersecting the past light cone , but also on cauchy data interior to that intersection .",
    "the portion of the field that propagates in the null directions is called the _ direct _ part , while the portion of the field that propagates in the timelike directions inside the light cone is called the _",
    "tail_. ) clearly , the tail part of a particle s field can interact with the particle , leading to a contribution to the self - force .",
    "although in principle this formal solution gives the desired result , in practice the calculation of the green s function poses a formidable challenge .",
    "there has been a significant amount of work in this area in recent years .",
    "various techniques have been employed .",
    "there has been considerable recent success using mode - sum approaches , amongst others @xcite .",
    "other work has focused on a matched expansion approach and also on obtaining exact solutions under specific circumstances . for the schwarzschild background ,",
    "wiseman @xcite found an exact solution for the scalar self - force on a particle held at rest .",
    "anderson , hu and eftekharzadeh @xcite built on this work along with other results to derive an expression for the self - force on a particle held at rest , then released and allowed to fall radially inward .",
    "anderson and wiseman @xcite also examined the matched expansion approach under the two cases of static particles and circular geodesic paths in a schwarzschild background . for the case of a gravitational field , anderson , flanagan and ottewill @xcite have evaluated the quasi - local contribution to the self - force up to @xmath5 .",
    "comprehensive reviews of the radiation - reaction and self - force problem are given by poisson @xcite and by detweiler @xcite .    in this paper , we use the results of dcanini and folacci @xcite as a basis for our own work . in section",
    "[ sec : recapquinn ] we first recap the work of quinn @xcite to define what we mean by the quasi - local part of the self - force and then we derive an expression for it and for the equations of motion in terms of the green s function .",
    "next , in section [ sec : cov ] we use this result to calculate an expression for the quasi - local portion of the scalar self - force in terms of the expansion coefficients given by ref .",
    "@xcite , and in terms of the proper time to the matching point @xmath6 and the 4-velocity of the particle , @xmath7 .    by making the assumption of motion in a massless field on a vacuum background spacetime",
    ", we show in section [ sec : simplify ] that the resulting self - force expression simplifies considerably and in fact vanishes up to and including third order in @xmath6 .    in section [ sec : cases ] , we examine some particularly interesting and simple cases in both schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes .",
    "we then show that using a corrected form of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain identical results , order by order for these special cases .",
    "this confirms the consistency of our results and the validity of our approach . we also present corrected results for the higher order terms in ref .",
    "@xcite and give updated truncation error graphs .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use units in which @xmath8 and adopt the sign conventions of @xcite .",
    "we denote symmetrization of indices using brackets ( e.g. @xmath9 ) and exclude indices from symmetrization by surrounding them by vertical bars ( e.g. @xmath10 ) .",
    "roman letters are used for free indices and greek letters for indices summed over all spacetime dimensions .",
    "consider a particle of scalar charge @xmath4 and mass @xmath0 travelling in a curved background spacetime .",
    "we treat this as a point particle and will refer to it as a particle throughout this paper .",
    "however , the arguments presented here are equally valid for non - point objects provided the object s extended structure does not affect its center - of - mass motion .    the scalar field generated by the particle propagates along null geodesics , while the particle itself will ( approximately ) follow a time - like geodesic of the background .",
    "the field then interacts with the particle , effectively causing a force , called the scalar self - force .",
    "this self - force may be expressed as a sum of local and non - local parts @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the 4-velocity of the particle , @xmath13 is the 4-acceleration , @xmath14 is the derivative of the 4-acceleration with respect to proper time and @xmath15 is the retarded scalar green s function . here , we have trivially extended the expression given in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite to include terms corresponding to the field mass @xmath16 and coupling to the background scalar curvature , @xmath17 .    in this form ,",
    "the local terms are all given explicitly , so their calculation can be carried out immediately without posing any real difficulty .",
    "our task is therefore to elucidate the non - local integral term . to this end",
    ", we will work with an expression for the self - force which just contains the non - local integral term : @xmath18 we do so with the understanding that the local terms can easily be added back in later if necessary .",
    "this leaves us with an expression for the scalar self - force in terms of an integral of the gradient of the retarded green s function over the entire past world line of the particle .",
    "the limiting feature at the upper limit of integration is necessary because of the singular nature of the green s function at the point @xmath19 .",
    "this integral would normally be evaluated using a mode - sum approach .",
    "one would calculate a sufficient number of the modes and sum them up to obtain the green s function solution and hence the self - force .",
    "however , the limiting feature in the upper limit of integration causes great difficulties for this method .",
    "as @xmath20 decreases , it is necessary to take an increasing number of modes to obtain an accurate solution .",
    "when @xmath20 tends towards 0 , the number of modes required becomes infinite and it is no longer possible to accurately compute the integral .",
    "however , we can avoid this problem if we split the integral in two parts @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a _ matching point_. it is chosen so that both integrals may be evaluated separately using different means and then combined to obtain an expression for the total self - force . the second integral in this expression",
    "may be evaluated , for example , by using the methods of quantum field theory in curved spacetime @xcite to perform a mode - sum calculation of the green s function away from the singularity @xmath19 .",
    "we call the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : splitforce ] ) the _ quasi - local _ part of the self - force .",
    "it is the computation of this integral that is the main focus of the remainder of this paper .",
    "the greatest obstacle to obtaining a solution for this quasi - local integral lies with the difficulty in the computation of the retarded green s function , @xmath15 .",
    "it is a solution of the wave equation on a curved background spacetime : @xmath23 in general , it proves extremely difficult , if not impossible , to find an exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wave ] ) .",
    "however , provided @xmath24 and @xmath25 are sufficiently close , we can use the hadamard form for the retarded green s function solution @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is analogous to the heaviside step - function ( i.e. @xmath28 when @xmath25 is in the causal past of @xmath24 , @xmath29 otherwise ) , @xmath30 is the standard dirac delta function , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are symmetric bi - scalars having the benefit that they are regular for @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the synge @xcite world function . for the time - like geodesics that are of interest to this paper",
    ", @xmath35 is equal to minus one half of the squared geodesic distance between @xmath24 and @xmath25 : @xmath36    this form of the retarded green s function is valid provided @xmath25 lies within a normal neighborhood of @xmath24 , i.e. provided there is a unique geodesic connecting @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "clearly , by simply choosing an appropriate value for @xmath6 , we can satisfy this normal neighborhood condition and use the hadamard form for the retarded green s function in the first integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : splitforce ] ) .. ]    the first term ( involving @xmath31 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hadamard ] ) is called the _ direct _ part of the green s function and does not contribute to the self - force .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the presence of @xmath37 in the direct part of @xmath15 means that it is only non - zero on the past light - cone of the particle . however , since the quasi - local integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : splitforce ] ) is totally internal to the past light - cone , this term does not contribute to the integral .    the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hadamard ] ) is known as the _ tail _ part of the green s function .",
    "it is this term that is responsible for the self - force and its calculation is the primary focus of this paper .",
    "we can now substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : hadamard ] ) into the quasi - local part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : splitforce ] ) to obtain the final form of the quasi - local self - force : @xmath38 note that it is no longer necessary to take the limit since @xmath39 is regular everywhere .    unlike the cases of electromagnetic and gravitational fields , where the 4-acceleration is exactly equal to the self - force divided by the mass",
    ", there is one further step required in order to obtain the equations of motion in the presence of a scalar field . in this case , the self - force contains two components , one related to the 4-acceleration , the other related to the change in mass :    @xmath40    the 4-acceleration is always orthogonal to the 4-velocity , so in order to obtain it from the self - force , we take the projection of @xmath41 orthogonal to @xmath42 :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the projection orthogonal to @xmath7 .",
    "the remaining component of the self - force ( which is tangent to the 4-velocity ) is simply the change in mass :    @xmath45",
    "within the hadamard approach , the symmetric bi - scalar @xmath39 is expressed in terms of an expansion in increasing powers of @xmath35 @xcite : @xmath46 substituting the expansion ( [ eq : v ] ) into eq .",

    "such cancellation is also seen , for example , in desitter space - time , where for a conformally invariant theory all the @xmath57 s are non - zero while @xmath58 .    in order to solve the recursion relations ( [ eq : recursionv ] ) and ( [ eq : initialv ] ) for the coefficients @xmath59 , it is convenient to first write @xmath60 in terms of its covariant taylor series expansion about @xmath61 : @xmath62 where the @xmath63 are bi - scalars of the form @xmath64    dcanini and folacci @xcite calculated expressions for these @xmath63 up to @xmath65 , or equivalently @xmath66 , where @xmath6 is the magnitude of the proper time separation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in appendix",
