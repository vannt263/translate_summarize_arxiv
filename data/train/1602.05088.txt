    "the compton scattering of unpolarized photons on free thermal electrons plays a crucial role in continuum and line spectrum formation in various astrophysical objects .",
    "the essential features of the scattering are a random change of direction of photon propagation and an exchange of energy and momentum between colliding particles .",
    "compton scattering is a dominant source of continuum opacity in very hot da white dwarfs and unmagnetized neutron stars and is responsible for the continuum spectrum formation in type i x - ray bursters .    in other objects",
    "compton scattering influences the line spectrum of ob giant or main sequence stars by filling absorption lines with continuum radiation . in the x - ray domain ,",
    "the compton scattering of external irradiation creates a compton shoulder of fluorescent iron @xmath1 lines at 6.4 kev in the spectra of active galactic nuclei and galactic black hole binaries .",
    "the scattering is an intrinsically strongly nonisotropic process , which also depends on the state of the incident photon polarization .",
    "however , herein , we consider the angle - averaged compton scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation in the absence of a magnetic field . such an averaged process can be best described by a redistribution function , which gives the probability density of photon energy and the momentum change upon scattering .",
    "the compton scattering of unpolarized radiation has been studied in a number of papers in the literature and the most pertinent to the present study being those of guilbert ( 1981 ) , nagirner and poutanen ( 1993 ) and poutanen ( 1994 ) , with the latter two papers dealing with the scattering of polarized radiation .",
    "herein we compared the results with those from two papers by guilbert ( 1981 ) and suleimanov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who presented formulae for photon number redistribution over the energy and scattering angles of unpolarized radiation in isotropic plasma with fully relativistic electron thermal velocities .    therefore , it is useful to collect and compare the formulae derived in various published papers describing the redistribution of compton scattered photons over energies for various scattering angles .",
    "our aim was to obtain expressions for compton scattering cross sections and kernels ( pomraning 1973 ) that would be useful in a very wide range of temperatures and frequencies .",
    "suitable e.g. , for carrying out model atmosphere calculations of neutron stars and relativistic accretion disks .",
    "section 2 thus presents a list of equations and auxiliary variables that allow for the determination of compton scattering cross - sections in unified form following various methods .",
    "we do not aim to discuss or evaluate the corresponding physical assumption or approximations used in the original papers .",
    "section [ sec : sec3 ] presents the compton redistribution formulae by guilbert ( 1981 ) , but corrected for computational errors in the original paper .",
    "section 4 presents the compton redistribution function originally derived by nagirner and poutanen ( 1993 ) and suleimanov et al .",
    "note , that both approaches implement precise klein - nishina scattering cross - sections from electrons at rest . for a completeness",
    ", both angle - dependent cross - sections were compared to a third , approximate formula obtained assuming that electron scattering is isotropic with classical thomson cross - sections in the electron rest frame ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ; suleimanov et al .",

    "the scattering electrons in the plasma of temperature @xmath12 have a thermal relativistic maxwellian velocity distribution given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the electron lorentz factor .    the following sections ( sections 3 - 5 ) present three different algorithms for the computation of the compton scattering redistribution function in a unified form , suitable for the radiative transfer calculations . algorithms were either corrected for fatal algebraic errors ( guilbert 1981 ) or reexpressed to a more optimal form than that given in suleimanov ( 2012 )",
    "we do not aim to rediscuss the physical assumptions used for the derivation of those methods and we apply the original symbols and variables where possible .",
    "photon energies below can be expressed in units of the electron rest mass @xmath15 note , that the variable @xmath16 denotes dimensionless temperature in the following section [ sec : sec3 ] ; whereas the same symbols @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the photon energies @xmath18 and @xmath19 in sections [ sec : sec4 ] and [ sec : sec8 ] .",
    "guilbert ( 1981 ) simply folded the klein - nishina scattering cross section with the relativistic maxwellian velocity distribution ( see eq .",
