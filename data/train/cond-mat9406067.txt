    "copolymers with attraction between similar kinds of monomers have received a lot of attention in the previous decade @xcite .",
    "their most important applications arise from the remarkable changes in their mechanical properties when they undergo a microphase separation transition .",
    "regular block copolymers with well - defined architectures along the sequence constitute the most important class of such materials .",
    "the study of these systems showed that they can undergo a temperature induced microphase separation transition into a variety of phases with a periodic domain structure and different crystalline symmetries .",
    "the scale of the domains is proportional to the coil size of a block defined by the sequence architecture and , therefore , does not depend on temperature .",
    "a different class of copolymeric materials are the random -or statistical- copolymers where each monomer along the sequence can be , randomly , of the one or the other kind @xcite or there is a large distribution of block lengths @xcite .",
    "the important feature of these systems is the quenched disorder along the sequence .",
    "the theoretical study on the level of mean field @xcite showed that they also undergo a temperature induced phase separation transition .",
    "it was shown that , near the transition point , the domain size depends very strongly on temperature .",
    "the transition from the disordered to the ordered phase has been predicted to be third order .    in all these cases ,",
    "the finite scale of domains is a natural consequence of the polymeric effect that prevents macrophase separation as would happen in a gas of disconnected @xmath0 and @xmath1 species with attraction between similar kinds . as a result of this finite scale",
    "the inverse of the renormalized propagator , has a minimum at finite momenta and the effect of fluctuations is anomalously large .    in the case of regular block copolymers , where the phase separation scale does not depend on temperature ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian in the fourier representation is of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath2m({\\bf{\\text k}})m(-{\\bf{\\text k } } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + v^{-1}\\sum_{{\\bf{\\text k}}_1,{\\bf{\\text k}}_2,{\\bf{\\text    k}}_3}\\lambda ( { \\bf{\\text k}}_1,{\\bf{\\text k}}_2,{\\bf{\\text k}}_3 ) m({\\bf{\\text k}}_1)m({\\bf{\\text k}}_2)m({\\bf{\\text    k}}_3)m(-{\\bf{\\text k}}_1-{\\bf{\\text",
    "k}}_2-{\\bf{\\text k}}_3),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the order parameter is the difference between the local densities of each kind of monomers .    in this hamiltonian",
    "there is a minimum of the inverse propagator for @xmath3 and the fourth order vertex has the form of the usual ising model vertex with three independent momentum vectors .",
    "the mean field theory for this hamiltonian @xcite predicts a continuous second order transition . in this",
    "hamiltonian the momentum dependence of the fourth order vertex turns out to be not very crucial @xcite and @xmath4 can be taken as a constant .",
    "then , the hamiltonian of the regular block copolymer can be mapped onto the hamiltonian for the brazovskii theory of weak crystallization @xcite .    in his seminal work @xcite",
    ", brazovskii showed that in systems where the inverse propagator has an absolute minimum at @xmath3 , a continuous transition of the landau type is impossible .",
    "in particular , he showed on the level of the hartree approximation , that fluctuations stabilize the disordered phase and prevent the renormalized mass from becoming zero or negative . for hamiltonians of this kind , however , he showed that , in the range where the hartree approximation is valid , a phase transition is possible because the ordered phase becomes first locally stable and eventually globally stable , so a first order transition occurs .",
    "the analogy between the brazovskii theory and the regular block copolymers was pointed out by fredrickson and helfand @xcite , who calculated the corrections to the phase diagram of leibler . in a later study , dobrynin and",
    "erukhimovich @xcite proposed a variational method to modify the brazovskii theory in order to take into account the explicit momentum dependence of the forth order vertex reproducing the results of @xcite .",
    "interesting predictions of the fluctuation effects based on the brazovskii theory were also made    by taking into account higher harmonics of the phase separation order parameter , regarding the behavior of some exotic structures observed with hexagonal cylinders arranged in lamellar layers @xcite .",
    "the explicit analogy between the brazovskii theory and the theory of regular block copolymers is due to the fact that the phase separation scale in the latter does not depend on temperature and is fixed by the well - defined architecture of the sequence . in random copolymers the strong temperature dependence of the phase separation scale creates qualitative differences in the fluctuation treatment of the problem , as will be seen in the present work .    a first effort to describe the microphase separation transition in random copolymers beyond mean field was made in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , although the inverse of the bare propagator has a minimum at zero momentum , the renormalized one has a minimum at a finite momentum . in that case",
    "it is known from the brazovskii theory that fluctuations make the disordered phase locally stable .    in all the previous mean field studies",
    "@xcite of random copolymers certain terms of the hamiltonian were ignored because they were shown to have a very weak effect within the limits of mean field .",
    "the consecutive fluctuation studies @xcite also ignored these terms . for this hamiltonian",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that the one - loop calculation is exact and higher - loop diagrams do not contribute to the dyson equation in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it was also found that , in the framework of the examined hamiltonian , fluctuations destroy the stability of the ordered phase and the microphase separation transition disappears .    in the present work",
    "we examine the complete effective hamiltonian for random copolymers with strong short range correlations of monomer kinds along the sequence , _",
    "i.e. _ , with a wide distribution of block lengths .",
    "we show that the previously omitted terms play an important role in restoring the phase transition .",
    "due to the presence of these extra terms the ordered phase becomes stable at some temperature and the system can undergo a weak first order transition to a phase with periodic microdomain structure .",
    "the period of the domains and the amplitude of the separation below the transition temperature are the same as those predicted by mean field .",
    "the random two - letter copolymer is described by a microscopic hamiltonian that takes into account the self - interactions between monomers as @xmath5 where the conformation of the polymer is described by the coordinates of    its monomers @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a short - range potential .",
    "the binary interaction virial coefficient is given @xcite by    @xmath8    the sequence of monomers is described by a quenched set of random values @xmath9 with equal probabilities for the two types of monomers ; @xmath10 if monomer @xmath11 is of type @xmath0 and @xmath12 if it is of type @xmath1 . when the interactions between similar monomers are equal @xmath13 then @xmath14 .",
    "the composite flory parameter will be negative in the case of interest where similar monomers attract each other .",
    "the constant @xmath15 corresponds to an overall attraction in the two body term .",
    "this overall attraction , in combination with a three - body repulsion term which is not explicitly introduced in the hamiltonian , are known to lead the polymer to a compact state with constant density @xcite .",
    "this well - studied effect is purely homopolymeric and will not be considered in the present study where only heteropolymeric effects are taken into account .    in this model",
    "we consider that a monomer of one kind is followed , with high probability , by a monomer of the same kind . correspondingly , the correlations between kinds of monomers decay as @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the average block length with monomers of one kind .",
    "the polymeric effect is explicitly introduced through the elastic term @xcite that constrains the position of consecutive monomers at an average distance 1 : @xmath18\\ ] ]    in this system , attraction between similar types of monomers generates an energetic preference for phase separation . in the absence of polymeric bonds",
    ", a complete phase separation is taking place . in the presence of polymeric bonds ,",
    "though , we can only expect a microphase separation .",
    "this phase separation is described by the order parameter @xcite @xmath19 which corresponds to the difference @xmath20 between the densities of the two types of monomers . in the present study",
    "we refer to the case where there is an equal amount of @xmath0 and @xmath1 types which is usually referred to as composition @xmath21 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is of the form @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the volume of the system and the fourier transform is defined as    @xmath24 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath25 of the first vertex is inversely proportional to the square of the average block length @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath27 .",
    "this vertex corresponds to the loss of entropy due to polymeric bonds that connect different blocks with each other .",
    "we can see immediately that , due to this term , long wave - length modes become unfavorable . on the other hand ,",
    "very short wave - length modes are unfavorable due to the surface tension contribution in the second order term .",
    "the @xmath28 vertex has the usual form of the vertex in the ising model effective hamiltonian .",
    "this term is due to the discrete values @xmath29 of the sequence @xmath30 . in an annealed system , as for example in a binary alloy , where the quenched polymeric bonds are absent , this is the entropic fourth order term that provides stability of the ordered phase with macroscopic phase separation into two domains . in the case of random copolymers",
    "the coefficient of this vertex is @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is of order unity per typical block in units of @xmath32 .",
    "the momentum dependence of this term can be neglected for scales larger than the coil size of the average block which is of order @xmath33 .",
    "this is the term omitted from all previous mean field studies .",
    "it is seen immediately that this term becomes comparable with the    other vertex @xmath34 only at scales @xmath35 and therefore it was argued that it can be omitted for larger domain scales predicted by mean field .",
    "then , it was shown @xcite that the mean field solution can be taken in the form    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is kronecker s delta .",
    "this solution corresponds to the lamellar phase .",
    "the mean field amplitude @xmath38 and the frequency @xmath39 can be determined by minimization of ( 2.6 ) to be    @xmath40    where the effect from @xmath28 is negligible because @xmath39 is very small near the transition .",
    "thus , the mean field theory predicts a continuous phase transition at @xmath41 .",
    "this transition was found to be third order .",
    "the effective hamiltonian which contains only the heteropolymeric vertex is equivalent to a gaussian sequence model , _",
    "i.e. _ , a quenched sequence of gaussian variables @xmath30 instead of discrete ones @xmath29 .",
    "this approximation does not change the mean field results but is crucial for the fluctuation analysis that will be performed in the following sections .",
    "we will show in sec .",
    "iv that this is the only term that provides the stability of the order phase .",
    "we will refer to the effective hamiltonian without the @xmath28 vertex as the gaussian sequence approximation .",
    "in this section we will consider the effective hamiltonian in the    gaussian sequence approximation , describing the microphase separation transition in random copolymers , as @xmath42    this is the hamiltonian that has been used in all previous mean field studies .",
    "shortly after the derivation of this hamiltonian it was observed @xcite that a renormalization of the green function on the one - loop level changes its form qualitatively .",
    "the one - loop dyson equation for the green function is @xmath43 by substituting even the bare green function into the integral of ( 3.2 ) for @xmath44 , the renormalized green function in three dimensions is @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "we see immediately that there is a minimum of @xmath47 at some @xmath3 .",
    "it was , therefore , proposed that the form of the renormalized green function can be described by the form used in the weak crystallization theory @xcite @xmath48 this approximation is good for @xmath49 . by substitution of this into ( 5 )",
    "it is found that @xmath50 according to the first relation in ( 3.5 ) , the renormalized mass @xmath51 , can not become zero except for @xmath52 which corresponds to @xmath53",
    ". therefore the disordered phase never looses stability as in the brazovskii theory .",
    "this result is quite general and is due to the fact that the integral corresponding to the one loop correction , @xmath54},\\ ] ] is divergent as @xmath55 . on the basis of this evidence",
    "it was assumed that this system will have a first order transition of the brazovskii type .",
    "a more careful study , however , was done in @xcite and is presented briefly in the rest of this section .",
    "consider the diagrams that contribute to a perturbation expansion .",
    "the contribution of the one - loop diagram shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) to the dyson equation is of order @xmath56    the two - loop diagram shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) is of order @xmath57 and should be neglected in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we can easily see that all higher - loop diagrams do not contribute for the same reasons .    from the above remarks we conclude that the one - loop dyson equation given in ( 3.2 ) is exact and the lack of continuous transition for the effective hamiltonian ( 3.1 ) is a general result that does not depend on the smallness of the parameter @xmath25 .    on the premises discussed above ,",
    "we calculate here the stability of the ordered phase .",
    "if we assume that the symmetry is broken as described by ( 2.7 ) we need to write down the free energy functional @xmath58 .",
    "the order parameter is @xmath59    fluctuations of the mode @xmath60 are of order 1 and are ignored compared to the mean field @xmath61 .",
    "fluctuations of other modes are denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "then the free energy functional becomes @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the value of the hamiltonian ( 3.1 ) if we substitute the mean field solution in the form given by ( 2.7 ) .",
    "the classical field values @xmath65 are found from the equation of state given by the thermodynamic relations @xmath66 the first equation reads @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the dyson equation for the ordered phase for @xmath69 is @xmath70 this equation is exact since higher - loop diagrams are subdominant in @xmath23 due to the peculiar symmetry of our vertex .",
    "then , by comparison of eqs .",
    "( 3.12 ) and ( 3.13 ) we see that @xmath71 depends only on the modulus @xmath72 and @xmath73 the minimum value of @xmath47 is positive since if @xmath74 the integral of ( 16 ) diverges .",
    "then @xmath75 and therefore , according to eq .",
    "( 3.14 ) , @xmath76 .",
    "we see that we can not have a stable solution with @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the hamiltonian ( 3.1 ) .",
    "in the previous section we saw that , although on the level of mean field the results should not be affected by the omission of the second vertex @xmath28 , the fluctuation analysis using only the heteropolymeric vertex @xmath25 results in the absence of any kind of microphase separation transition .",
    "this result is expectable even from mean field estimates if we notice the following .",
    "the inverse propagator for the ordered phase calculated on the level of mean field in the absence of @xmath28 is @xmath79 by substitution of the mean field values ( 2.8 ) we see that the inverse propagator has a minimum at @xmath80 .",
    "then the bare mass in the ordered phase is given by @xmath81 by substitution of the mean field values ( 2.8 ) for @xmath38 and @xmath39 this gives @xmath82 .",
    "the consideration of the complete hamiltonian ( 2.6 ) is then necessary .",
    "if @xmath28 is included we see that the bare mass becomes positive and the ordered phase is stable independently of the relative smallness of @xmath28 compared to @xmath83 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the mass for the ordered phase on the level of mean field is    @xmath84    we now shift our attention to the effect of fluctuations .",
    "the point at which fluctuations become important can be estimated by comparing the contribution of the diagram of fig .",
    "2(a ) to the @xmath85 function with the bare vertex value .",
    "the vertex @xmath83 gives larger contribution than the equivalent of @xmath28 at a given temperature and therefore the ginsburg criterion for the validity of mean field should be calculated by the diagram of fig .",
    "2(a ) for the @xmath25 vertex .",
    "we first consider the disordered phase . in this case",
    "the ginsburg criterion is given by @xmath86 this is satisfied for any @xmath87 if @xmath88    for the ordered phase the ginsburg criterion is equivalent to @xmath89 which due to eq .",
    "( 4.3 ) becomes    @xmath90    from the other hand we can see that the mean field value for @xmath38 becomes of order one at @xmath91 and the landau expansion breaks down .",
    "therefore the region where mean field is valid for the ordered phase is @xmath92 since mean field is correct in this region we can conclude that _ there is _ a phase transition between the disordered phase with @xmath76 and the ordered phase with @xmath77 .",
    "analogously , fluctuation corrections arising from the @xmath28 vertex can be neglected for @xmath93 .",
    "this gives the ginsburg criterion for this vertex in the ordered phase @xmath94 which is smaller than the ginsburg value of @xmath95 for @xmath25 as anticipated above .      according to the derived criteria",
    "there is a region of temperatures @xmath96 where the dyson equation in the ordered phase should be described by @xmath97 because the one - loop contribution of the vertex @xmath25 is exact according to the analysis given in sec .",
    "the equation obtained from the variation of the free energy expression with respect to the amplitude @xmath38 is @xmath98 by comparison of eqs .",
    "( 4.10 ) and ( 4.11 ) we see that there is a solution for the field amplitude @xmath99    from the minimization of the free energy with respect to the parameter @xmath100 we get @xmath101=0.\\ ] ]    this equation coincides with the equation for the minimum @xmath102 of the inverse propagator by differentiation of the dyson equation ( 4.10 ) for the ordered phase and @xmath102 coincides with @xmath39 . by taking @xmath103 and using brazovskii s estimate for the integrals it follows from eq .",
    "( 4.10 ) @xmath104 substituting eq .",
    "( 4.12 ) in eq .  ( 4.14 ) we obtain @xmath105 since we are considering scales much larger than the coil size of the average block we always have @xmath106 and the dyson equation for the ordered phase has the form @xmath107 we notice that the second term of the right hand side of ( 4.16 ) is small compared to @xmath95 for @xmath108 .",
    "the same condition is also valid in order to neglect the contribution of the last term in ( 4.13 ) .",
    "consequently , the mean field results for @xmath109 and @xmath39 will hold true in    the region ( 4.9 ) .    as we approach @xmath110 the three terms of ( 4.16 ) become of the same order .",
    "it easy to show that for @xmath111 and , correspondingly , for @xmath112 this equation has real solutions for @xmath51 where @xmath113 and the solution with @xmath51 growing as @xmath95 grows corresponds to the minimum of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "correspondingly , for @xmath114 eq .  ( 4.16 ) does not have a solution .",
    "this means that in that region the ordered phase is locally unstable .",
    "we can easily see from the first equation in ( 3.5 ) that the disordered phase does not loose local stability at @xmath110 .",
    "then there must be a first order phase transition as in the theory of weak crystallization of brazovskii .",
    "it can be shown rigorously with brazovskii s method    @xcite that at the temperature of the order predicted by ( 4.17 ) the ordered phase becomes globally stable .",
    "the jump in the amplitude , according to ( 4.12 ) , is given by @xmath115    we note that the order of the transition temperature coincides with the ginsburg temperature for the vertex @xmath28 predicted by eq .",
    "however , one - loop corrections to the dyson equation due to this vertex need not be considered because the divergent contribution of the @xmath25 vertex is much larger .",
    "it is also easy to show that at @xmath110 the higher - loop terms for @xmath28 do not contribute .    as explained in sec .",
    "iii , the one - loop correction for the vertex @xmath25 is not an approximation but the exact contribution of this vertex to the self - energy . we must also mention that for the renormalization of the four - point function @xmath116 for this vertex , only the channel of fig .",
    "2(a ) contributes to the geometric progression for the ladder diagrams since the channel of fig .",
    "2(b ) must be neglected according to the arguments of sec .",
    "in contrast , for the vertex @xmath28 brazovskii showed that there are two channels contributing to the renormalization of @xmath117 as shown in fig .",
    "2(c)-(d ) and the geometric progression for the renormalized four - point function has a special form given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "it is seen that when @xmath120 @xmath117 changes sign which does not happen for the four - point function @xmath116 .",
    "this change of sign can be interpreted as a hint for the existence of an inflection in the thermodynamic potential which should exist at the temperature where the ordered phase becomes locally stable and below .",
    "we investigated the effect of thermal fluctuations on the microphase separation transition in a melt of random copolymers .",
    "we considered a quenched sequence consisted of an equal amount of monomers of two kinds in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the model assumes that neighboring monomers are with high probability of the same kind with average block length @xmath17 and a wide distribution of block lengths .",
    "our analysis indicates that there is a weak first order phase transition between a disordered and an ordered phase with periodic microdomain structure instead of a continuous third order one predicted by mean field .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( 2.6 ) for this system contains two fourth - order vertices with completely different forms .",
    "the vertex labeled @xmath25 is solely due to the polymeric effect and prohibits macroscopic phase separation .",
    "the vertex @xmath28 which has the usual ising model form is due to the discrete values @xmath29 for the sequence labels @xmath30 . in mean field ,",
    "the contribution of the vertex @xmath28 is negligible around the transition point and can be omitted .",
    "an exact analysis of fluctuations in the absence of vertex @xmath28 is possible and shows that the disordered phase is always locally stable . at the same time",
    "the ordered phase is locally unstable and the phase transition is impossible .      for the complete hamiltonian ( 2.6 )",
    ", we showed that the mean field predictions @xmath121 are correct in the region @xmath122 the weak first order transition takes place at @xmath110 with a jump in the amplitude @xmath123        in the case of regular block copolymers , the jump in the corresponding fluctuationally induced first order transition predicted in @xcite is @xmath124 , where @xmath125 the fixed block size of the sequence .",
    "we see that the jump predicted for random copolymers is smaller .",
    "the temperature of transition in regular block copolymers is predicted at @xmath126 .",
    "we see that the corresponding shift for random copolymers is also smaller .",
    "we notice that in random copolymers the domain size near transition @xmath127 is much larger than the corresponding domain size in regular block copolymers @xmath128 .",
    "the amplitude of the transition at the ordered phase in regular block copolymers @xmath129 is      we also see that , when there are no correlations along the sequence _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath130 , the predicted transition occurs at a region where the landau expansion fails .",
    "the physics of this system is also described by a freezing transition into a phase where a small number of conformations is thermodynamically dominant @xcite and depends strongly on the flexibility of the chain @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noticing that in the absence of the vertex @xmath28 , the vertex @xmath25 does not have any preference for the different bravais lattices @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy of the polymeric vertex @xmath25 is related to the instability of the ordered phase predicted on the basis of only this vertex .",
    "all the structure dependence comes from the vertex @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the analysis of structures other than the lamellar is expected to be similar to that of brazovskii . in the case of composition",
    "@xmath21 , there is no cubic term that breaks the inversion symmetry .",
    "although other structures are locally stable the lamellar would retain global stability . for compositions",
    "@xmath131 other structures like bcc and hexagonal cylinders may become globally stable and transitions between them may be possible .    in all the calculations",
    "the integral for the one - loop correction of fig .",
