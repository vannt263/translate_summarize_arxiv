    ", this statistical measurement can be achieved by angle resolved homodyne measurement of the operator @xmath3 to acquire statistics of the squared modulus of the wave function @xmath4 . instead of the quantum state @xmath0 ,",
    "one is rather usually interested in reconstructing the more general density matrix @xmath5 of the system . fully equivalent to @xmath5 ,",
    "it is also possible to reconstruct the wigner function @xmath6 from @xmath4 .",
    "however , the reconstruction of @xmath5 or @xmath6 is not immediate and requires the reconstruction of the complex phase of the quantum system from the many angle resolved measurements . with the measurement of @xmath4 ,",
    "these two operations together are referred to as quantum homodyne tomography or optical homodyne tomography @xcite .",
    "while some tomography algorithms reconstruct the former density matrix , others rather reconstruct the latter wigner function . independently",
    ", tomography algorithms can be roughly classified into two species . historically the first to be proposed and used for optical homodyne tomography ,",
    "linear methods exploit and inverse the linear relationship between the experimentally measurable quantity @xmath7 on one hand and @xmath5 or @xmath6 on the other hand . among them , the filtered back - projection algorithm @xcite based on the inverse radon transform @xcite is the most commonly used .",
    "similar in nature , there also exist methods based on quantum state sampling of individual components of the density matrix @xmath5 with sample functions @xcite .",
    "the linear methods , however , suffer in general from technical difficulties associated with the numerical deconvolution necessary to perform the linear inversion of the radon transform ( see sec .",
    "ii for details ) .",
    "in addition , they usually do not guarantee the physicality of the reconstructed state , the positivity of @xmath5 .",
    "finally they perform weakly against statistical noise and show numerical instabilities for higher frequency components and fine details of the reconstructed objects .",
    "variational methods , such as the maximum entropy @xcite and maximum likelihood @xcite algorithms , were latter applied to optical homodyne tomography to address these problems .",
    "these methods can be designed to enforce the physicality of the reconstructed state and are usually more resilient to statistical errors . since the reconstructed states are not defined constructively , an approximation procedure , typically iterative , is used to achieve the reconstruction in practice @xcite .",
    "notice that in theory it is actually possible to bypass these numerical reconstructions and directly observe the wigner function @xmath6 with repeated measures of the parity operator @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number operator @xcite .",
    "this measurement technique uses the link between the wigner function value at point @xmath10 and the expectation value of @xmath11 for the displaced density matrix @xmath5 @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the displacement operator and @xmath14 .",
    "a close tomography technique has been experimentally demonstrated in coupled systems of atoms and light @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a parity detector is a highly non - linear detector which can only be partially implemented for light beams with time - multiplexing and single photon detectors .",
    "therefore with current state - of - the - art technologies in quantum optics , it is not possible to rely on count statistics alone for quantum state tomography and one has to use optical homodyne tomography based on gaussian measurements .    while the linear methods look inferior to the variational methods , most of their associated problems are only technical in nature and can in principle be solved . in this paper",
    "we show that is it possible to use a linear reconstruction algorithm with better resilience to noise and better physical properties overall than the usual filtered back - projection method .",
    "the success of this approach lies in a systematic expansion of both the wigner function @xmath6 and the marginal distribution @xmath15 in polar coordinates .",
    "this circular harmonic expansion technique has been applied in the past to other problems where the radon transform plays a role in tomography @xcite , and here we adapt it to the quantum framework of optical homodyne tomography . in sec .",
    "ii we first review the basics of the inverse radon transform and the usual filtered back - projection algorithms for optical homodyne tomography . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the expansion method : we first conduct a spectral analysis of the angular components of @xmath15 and @xmath6 ; from this analysis we argue that a polynomial approximation is an efficient way to expand the radial components . in sec .",
    "iv we give details about the implementation of the algorithm and also provide an estimator of the reconstruction errors .",
    "using our estimator we study the performances relatively to the filtered back - projection algorithm on simulated and experimental data sets .",
    "we complete this comparison with numerical studies of the distance between target and reconstructed quantum states .",
    "in 1917 , radon introduces the integral transform @xmath16 of two - dimensional functions integrated along straight lines and provides the formula for the inverse transform @xmath17 @xcite . today",
    "the radon and inverse radon transforms are ubiquitous in tomography and find applications in many different area of science .",
    "the radon transform is as well applicable to optical homodyne tomography .",
    "first we recall the definition of the observable operator @xmath18 of an homodyne measurement , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the rotation operator in phase space , or phase - shifting operator .",
    "the marginal distribution of the homodyne current @xmath15 is then distributed according to the squared modulus of the wave function @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the eigenvector of @xmath18 .",
    "the radon transform @xmath16 links the wigner function @xmath6 of the quantum state @xmath0 and @xmath15 the marginal distribution of the homodyne current with a projection of @xmath6 on a particular angle of observation @xmath23 @xcite @xmath24 in his original paper , radon mathematically inverses his transform with the back - projection @xmath25 of the derivative of the hilbert transform @xmath26 of @xmath15 @xmath27 where the back - projection operator @xmath25 of a function @xmath28 is the function @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 expanding eq .",
    "we obtain the inversion formula @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the principal - value operator .",
    "although exact , this expression is nevertheless unusable with experimental data as the algebraic expression of @xmath15 is unknown .",
    "however , the projection - slice theorem or fourier slice theorem @xcite gives another reverse path from @xmath15 to @xmath6 to work around the difficulties of the principal - value operator ( see fig.[fig_transform_map ] ) .",
    "if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are , respectively , the one - dimensional and two - dimensional fourier transforms of @xmath15 and @xmath6 , then the projection - slice theorem states that @xmath35 simply computing the fourier transform @xmath33 from the measured data would seem like the most efficient way to obtain @xmath6 after a second inverse fourier transform , but eq .",
    "shows that it is necessary to interpolate @xmath34 in fourier space , which leads to significant numerical difficulties @xcite . to avoid this interpolation eq",
    "can be used to replace @xmath34 in the inverse fourier transform of @xmath6 to obtain the inversion formula , @xmath36 here , the marginal distribution is convoluted with an integration kernel @xmath37 and then back - projected into phase space , where @xmath37 is defined as the inverse fourier transform of @xmath38 @xmath39 to use eq . in practice it is necessary to regularize @xmath37 and replace it with some numerical approximation .",
    "this is possible with the use of a window function @xmath40 such that the integral , @xmath41 converges .    the most common way to regularize eq . is to choose @xmath42}(k)$ ] and introduce a hard frequency cutoff parameter @xmath43 so that @xmath44    in practice , the choice of @xmath43 affects how much high frequency components of the wigner function will get reconstructed . if @xmath43 is set too low the convolution in eq .",
    "will filter out the fine physical details of the wigner function .",
    "if @xmath43 is set too high , the convolution will introduce unphysical high frequency noise from the statistical errors in the measurement of @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig_kernel ] shows the integration kernel @xmath37 for different high frequency sensitivities . choosing the right value of @xmath43 is a trade off between these two regimes . from eqs . and",
    "it is also possible to insert other filter functions at different steps of the inversion to obtain modified algorithms with enhanced and more selective noise filtering properties . in any case",
    "the numerical implementation of eq . will rely on deconvolution of the marginal distribution , an operation very sensitive to statistical noise .",
    "to numerically perform optical homodyne tomography , it is necessary at some point to apply an approximation procedure from the infinite dimensional space which features the unknown physical state to a finite dimensional space used to describe the reconstructed state . in the filtered back - projection algorithm ,",
    "the discretization is achieved by direct evaluation of @xmath45 on the set of points @xmath46 chosen to probe the phase space . rather than this point - by - point reconstruction , a discretization of another space should help to solve the numerical issues encountered in sec .",
    "since we are dealing with objects behaving like probability distributions , the statistical moments of @xmath15 and @xmath6 might be a solution to the problem .",
    "in ref.@xcite , ourjoumtsev _ et al . _ describes such a technique where they parametrize the wigner function of a photon subtracted squeezed vacuum with the second and fourth moments of the marginal distribution @xmath15 .",
    "generalizing this approach for any quantum state to higher order moments requires the use of the moment generating function @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the expectation value of @xmath49 with regards to @xmath15 .",
    "superior to the moment generating function the characteristic function @xmath50 only needs the mean and variance to be defined to exist .",
    "this and the projection - slice theorem of eq .",
    "hint that fourier space is a good candidate for an efficient discretization .",
    "we decompose our discretization procedure in two steps : ( 1 ) an angular harmonic decomposition with fourier series ; ( 2 ) a polynomial series expansion of the radial components .",
    "we express @xmath6 in radial coordinates @xmath51 and notice that @xmath52 .",
    "therefore we write the radial part of @xmath53 in terms of a fourier series and we define the set of radial functions , or angular harmonic components @xmath54 by @xmath55 which allows us to write @xmath53 , @xmath56 with the symmetry relation @xmath57 .",
    "the 2d fourier transform @xmath34 of @xmath6 is written in radial coordinates , @xmath58 with the change of variables @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath34 is related to the weyl function @xmath60 by a simple @xmath61 rotation , @xmath62 we can easily write @xmath63 in polar coordinates in terms of the angular harmonic components @xmath64 of @xmath53 , @xmath65 with a jacobi - anger expansion of @xmath66 using bessel functions @xmath67 , @xmath68 it is possible to conduct the angular integration in eq . to obtain the expression , @xmath69 notice that @xmath70 is the @xmath71 order hankel transform of @xmath64 .    in the same fashion , since @xmath72 we decompose the marginal distribution as @xmath73 with the sets of radial functions @xmath74 defined by @xmath75 using the projection - slice theorem of eq . and the orthogonality of @xmath76 on @xmath77 $ ] we are able to write for every angular harmonic order @xmath78 , @xmath79 we have obtained a relation between , on one side the fourier transform of the angular harmonics of @xmath15 , and on the other side , the hankel transform of the angular harmonics of @xmath53 .",
    "if we inverse the hankel transform with the orthogonality relation , or closure relation of bessel functions , @xmath80 we finally obtain @xmath81    at that point it would be natural to convey some radial decomposition of @xmath64 and @xmath74 .",
    "however , there is no simple way to achieve this .",
    "looking at eq . , we notice that the fourier transform of @xmath82 , or at least @xmath83 , should be involved in the process .",
    "the latter is written in terms of the chebysheff s polynomials of the first kind @xmath84 @xmath85}(x).\\ ] ] equation hints at the use of the polynomial series to achieve this radial decomposition .",
    "it is safe to assume for applications that the wigner function will only take nonzero values from the origin up to a certain limit @xmath86 .",
    "since we are carrying the decomposition in polar coordinates what we are looking after is a polynomial family which is orthogonal on a disk of radius @xmath87 .",
    "there are of course infinitely many such families but one which proves to be particularly adequate to the task is the set of zernike polynomials @xmath88 originally introduced for the study of optical aberrations in lenses and other circular optical systems @xcite .",
    "the polynomials are defined for @xmath89 and @xmath90 even .",
    "while the angular part gives straightforward orthogonality and fits with our previous approach using fourier series , the radial components @xmath91 defined for @xmath92 by @xmath93 are orthogonal on @xmath94 $ ] with respect to the weight function @xmath95 for all positive and negative orders @xmath78 , @xmath96 furthermore it turns out that the radon transform of zernike polynomials happens to have the simple expression , @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the chebysheff s polynomials of the second kind @xcite ( see also the last paragraph of this section for a proof ) . the critical aspect for tomography lies in the fact that @xmath98 is again an orthogonal polynomial family on @xmath99 $ ] with respect to the weight function @xmath100 . in other words by finding a family of orthogonal polynomials whose radon transform element by element is yet another family of orthogonal polynomials , we have in some sense diagonalized the radon transform .",
    "the inverse radon transform can also be exactly calculated and any technical difficulties associated with kernel functions or regularization immediately vanish .    with the use of eq .",
    "we are eventually able to expand the angular harmonic functions @xmath64 on the @xmath71 order radial polynomials @xmath101 , @xmath102 given that @xmath101 is non zero only when @xmath89 and @xmath90 is even , we introduce the change of variable @xmath103 , re - index the sequence @xmath104 and rewrite eq .",

    "to conclude this comparative study of polynomial series expansion and filtered back - projection - based tomography , we numerically estimate in this final paragraph the distance between some original target quantum state and reconstructed states using both algorithms . for this purpose",
    "we will consider one distance for the wigner function and one distance for the density matrix .",
    "we use the @xmath223 euclidian distance @xmath228 for the wigner function defined by @xmath229 and with the frobenius norm @xmath230 defined by @xmath231 we define a distance @xmath232 for density matrix as @xmath233 first we choose a target state and derive its exact wigner function @xmath234 and density matrix @xmath235 .",
    "we then evaluate the distances from the target state according to eqs . and using as before monte carlo sampling techniques . rather than averaging a reconstructed state over many simulated data sets ,",
    "we average the distance computed over many reconstructed states and estimate the numbers : @xmath236 numerical simulation results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_distance_thm]-[fig_distance_cat ] for , respectively , a thermal state with @xmath129 , a mixture of vacuum and one - photon state @xmath213 , and an odd schroedinger s cat state with @xmath227 . in agreement with the previous results on tomography uncertainties",
    ", we observe that polynomial series expansion tomography performs better than filtered back - projection for these two first cases . in the case of the schroedinger s cat state @xmath237 ,",
    "both distances behave differently for higher @xmath149 and tend to reach a precision limit which depends on the tomography algorithm and settings .",
    "although the exact cause of this saturation is unknown , we believe it is due to the significantly more complex structure of the schroedinger s cat state . according to our simulations , it seems to depend only on the radial and angular precision settings , more precisely on parameters @xmath131 , @xmath130 , and @xmath43 . in this case again , polynomial series expansion proves to reach a higher precision level than filtered back - projection for a relevant range of tomography settings . to conclude this paragraph",
    ", it is interesting to notice that in the case of the @xmath228 distance there is an intrinsic limitation on the precision of polynomial series expansion tomography due to the circular geometry of the reconstruction space @xcite .",
    "this could be the reason for the saturation phenomenon visible in fig .",

    "we have shown and demonstrated a technique for optical homodyne tomography based on polynomial series expansion of the wigner function . in sec.ii",
    "we have given the basis of the usual filtered back - projection algorithm and explained the main reason for its weak performances against statistical noise .",
    "we have also introduced the projection - slice theorem and the relation between phase space , fourier space and the marginal distribution . in sec.iii",
    "we have shown that it is possible to link three families of orthogonal functions between these three spaces to decompose @xmath15 the marginal distribution , @xmath6 the wigner function , and their fourier transforms . we have shown that the radon transform preserves the orthogonality of these families and therefore takes an especially simple form in this case . in sec.iv we have explained and applied to experimental and simulated data the most straightforward implementation of that technique with a direct linear estimation of the coefficients of the polynomial series expansion .",
    "we have also provided estimators of the reconstruction errors and shown that it performs better than filtered back - projection tomography with respect to reconstruction artifacts and statistical errors .",
    "more precisely , polynomial series tomography is superior with fewer experimental data points and when higher radial resolution is needed for higher photon number states .",
    "these results are confirmed when looking at the distance between a chosen target state and states reconstructed with both tomography techniques .",
    "furthermore this technique exploits the projection slice theorem directly and therefore is faster than convolution based filtered back - projection .",
    "finally we remark that it is in principle possible to use the maximum likelihood technique to find the set of coefficients @xmath238 that maximizes the probability of measuring the experimentally measured data set .",
