    "two of the more important recent discoveries on nearby galaxies are : ( i ) the large majority of spheroidal galaxies in the nearby universe contain massive black holes , and ( ii ) the black hole mass correlates with the mass of the spheroid of the parent galaxy ( richstone et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "these discoveries suggest a ` causal connection between the formation and evolution of the black hole and the bulge ' ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , and have have led to the hypothesis of co - eval formation of massive black holes and galaxy spheroids , perhaps occurring in merging galaxies at high redshift ( franceschini et al .",
    "1999 , blain et al .",
    "1999 , kauffmann & haenelt 2000 ; page et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we have undertaken an extensive observational program from radio through ( sub)mm wavelengths of high redshift qsos in order to address the interesting possibility of co - eval black hole and spheroidal galaxy formation ( carilli et al .",

    "the @xmath0 qso pss 2322 + 1944 has an @xmath6 , and was discovered in the digitized palomar sky survey high redshift qso search ( djorgovski et al . in prep . ) .",
    "djorgovski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that 2322 + 1944 is a double source in the optical , with two similar spectrum components separated by about 1.5@xmath1 .",
    "this morphology may indicate a qso pair at @xmath0 , or gravitational lensing by an intervening galaxy .",

    "the rest frame ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of 2322 + 1944 is consistent with thermal emission from dust at a temperature of about 47  k ( cox et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the apparent fir luminosity is then @xmath9 l@xmath10 .",
    "radio continuum emission from 2322 + 1944 was detected at 1.4 ghz with the vla , with a total flux density of 102@xmath1120 @xmath12jy , and an intrinsic size of about 2@xmath1 ( carilli et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "cox et al . ( 2002 ) show that the radio through ir sed for 2322 + 1944 is similar to that of the dwarf nuclear starburst galaxy m82 , supporting the idea of active star formation co - eval with the agn activity of the qso .",
    "the implied star formation rate , up to 10@xmath13 m@xmath10 year@xmath14 if the source is not strongly gravitationally lensed , is adequate to form the majority of the stars in a normal spheroidal galaxy in a relatively short time ( @xmath15 years ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the global sed for 2322 + 1944 from cm - to - optical wavelengths is not out of the range defined by lower redshift , lower luminosity qsos ( carilli et al .",
    "2001b ; sanders et al .",
    "1989 ) , and hence the case for dust - heating by star formation based on the sed alone is by no means secure .",
    "omont et al .",
    "( 2001 ) point out that a pre - requisite for star formation at the rate considered for pss 2322 + 1944 is a massive reservoir of molecular gas ( @xmath16 m@xmath10 ) .",
    "such reservoirs have been detected via their co line emission in other ir - luminous qsos at @xmath2 ( omont et al .",

    "in this paper we present observations of co 10 and co 21 emission from the pss 2322 + 1944 using the very large array . from these data we derive the spatial distribution and excitation conditions of the molecular gas .",
    "we assume @xmath17 = 65 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "pss 2322 + 1944 was observed with the vla in the fall of 2001 using the d configuration ( 1 km maximum baseline ) .",
    "observations were made of the redshifted co 10 line at 22.515 ghz , and of the co 21 line at 45.035 ghz .",
    "a total of 14 hours was spent on each transition .",
    "the co 10 observations at 22.5 ghz employed the spectral line correlator mode with two polarizations and 7 spectral channels of 6.25 mhz width (= 83 km s@xmath14 ) . due to limitations with the vla bandwidth and correlator , the co 21 observations at 45 ghz were done using the continuum correlator mode with two ifs of 50 mhz bandwidth and two polarizations each .",
    "one of the ifs was centered on the co 21 emission line , while the second was centered 350 km s@xmath14 off the line in order to determine the continuum level , if any .",
    "this mode maximizes sensitivity to the line , but sacrifices a measurement of the line velocity profile .",
    "our co 21 analysis will necessarily assume the line profile as given by the 10 line .",
    "standard amplitude and phase calibration were applied , correcting for atmospheric opacity at high frequency , and the absolute flux density scale was set by observing 3c  286 . in the analysis below we include a 10@xmath20 systematic error due to calibration uncertainties at high frequency .",
    "fast switching phase calibration was employed ( carilli & holdaway 1999 ) with a cycle time of 3 minutes , although subsequent inspection of the phase stability showed that a cycle time of 15 minutes , or even longer , would have been easily adequate to maintain phase coherence . the observations took place at night under excellent weather conditions , with rms phase variations after calibration typically less than @xmath21 .",
    "the phase coherence was checked by imaging a calibrator with a similar calibration cycle time as that used for the target source . at all times",
    "the coherence was found to be better than 90@xmath20 .",
    "figure 1a shows the co 10 emission spectrum from 2322 + 1944 .",
    "a gaussian profile was fit to the spectrum with a resulting full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath22 km s@xmath14 , a peak flux density of @xmath23 mjy , and a velocity - integrated flux density of @xmath24 jy km s@xmath14 .",

    "the implied ( redshift corrected ) mean brightness temperature is 2.8 k. the velocity - integrated flux density is @xmath34 jy km s@xmath14 , assuming a line width as given by the co 10 transition .",

    "we have fit a standard one component lvg model simulating a spherical cloud to interpret the observed line ratios ( for details see carilli et al .",

    ", there is a degeneracy in lvg modeling between various parameters such as the density and kinetic temperature ( gsten et al . 1993 ) .",
    "our modeling is not meant as an exhaustive analysis , but is merely representative of the types of conditions that can give rise to the observed line ratios . given the paucity of information",
    ", we adopt a kinetic temperature of 47  k , corresponding to the temperature derived from the far - ir spectrum of thermal emission by warm dust ( cox et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we also use the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature at @xmath0 of 14  k. the co data can be reasonably fit by a model with : n(co ) = @xmath38 @xmath39 ,",
    "n(h@xmath3 ) = @xmath40 @xmath5 , and grad @xmath41 = 1 km s@xmath14 pc@xmath14 . given the inhomogeneity of the interstellar medium in the milky way and nearby galaxies , our assumption of uniform physical conditions is crude but appropriate for a source with four detected lines from the main co species and no information on rare isotopomers .",
    "the optical qso positions are shown as crosses on figure 2a . the deconvolved size and position angle of the co 21 emission from pss 2322 + 1944 are consistent with the separation and position angle of the double optical qso components found by djorgovski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , as is the observed radio continuum morphology at 1.4 ghz ( carilli et al .",
    "however , the resolution of the current vla image is insufficient to determine if the co emission is from two small components associated with the optical qsos , or from more diffuse emission with a mean ( redshift corrected ) brightness temperature of 2.8 k. the more extended emission to the southwest appears to be robust , although , given the relatively low surface brightness , we feel this extension needs to be confirmed with further observations .",
    "as discussed in carilli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the co excitation conditions for two other ir - luminous qsos at @xmath42 , bri 12020725 and bri 13350417 , are similar to those seen in the dwarf nuclear starburst galaxy m82 , and are consistent with a fairly high kinetic temperature of 70 k and a high ( mean ) molecular gas density of @xmath43 @xmath5 . for 2322 + 1944",
    "we find excitation conditions intermediate between those seen in m82 and those seen for the disk of the milky way .",
    "the data are consistent with a kinetic temperature equal to the temperature derived from the far - ir sed of the thermal emission by warm dust ( 47 k ) , and a density for the molecular gas of @xmath44 @xmath5 , ie . a factor 4 lower than that found for 12020725 and 1335 - 0417 .",
    "these results may indicate that the co emission from 2322 + 1944 is dominated by gas that is more diffuse and cooler than is seen in the other two qsos .",
    "however , if the co emission from 2322 + 1944 is strongly lensed , then differential magnification due to ( possibly ) different source - plane spatial distributions for the low and high excitation molecular gas makes a detailed excitation analysis problematic until higher resolution observations , and a proper lens model , are available .",
    "the apparent co 10 luminosity , @xmath45 , for pss 2322 + 1944 is @xmath46 k km s@xmath14 pc@xmath47 .",
    "the h@xmath3 gas mass can be calculated from the co luminosity assuming a value of x = the h@xmath3 mass - to - co(1 - 0 ) luminosity conversion factor in m@xmath10 ( k km s@xmath14 pc@xmath47)@xmath14 ( solomon et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath48 , as found for ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath49 l@xmath10 ; ulirgs ) by downes and solomon ( 1998 ) , leading to a molecular gas mass of @xmath50 m@xmath10 . of course , x depends on a number of factors , including the excitation conditions , and in the case of 2322 + 1944 the possibility of gravitational lensing complicates the situation .",
    "lastly , we consider the continuum - to - line ratio : @xmath51/[l'_{\\rm co(1 - 0)}]$ ] , in units of l@xmath10 ( k km s@xmath14 pc@xmath52)@xmath14 .",
    "solomon et al . (",
    "1997 ) show that this ratio increases with increasing @xmath53 , with values between 5 and 50 for galactic giant molecular clouds and nearby galaxies with @xmath54 l@xmath10 , and values between 80 and 250 for ulirgs .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have extended this relationship to include ir - excess , optically selected qsos at @xmath55 .",
    "these qsos have l@xmath56 values ranging from a few @xmath57 l@xmath10 to 10@xmath58 l@xmath10 .",
    "they find that the low @xmath59 qsos typically show continuum - to - line ratios ( as defined above ) between 100 and 260 , with the majority of sources toward the low end of this range .",

    "( 2000 ) for a large sample ir - selected galaxies . ]",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also find that the qsos with high continuum - to - line ratios reside in optically disturbed galaxies , ie .",
    "on - going mergers of gas rich spiral galaxies , while the sources with low values reside in more normal - looking galaxies .    for 2322 + 1944",

    "carilli et al .",
    "argued that the large continuum - to - line ratio in these latter two qsos , both of which have @xmath62 l@xmath10 , continues the trend of increasing continuum - to - line ratio with increasing ir luminosity .",
    "the fact that 2322 + 1944 has a continuum - to - line ratio more consistent with ulirgs , and with low redshift , lower ir luminosity qsos , could be used to argue for strong ( factor @xmath63 ) gravitational magnification of the emission regions , thereby lowering its ir luminosity to @xmath64 l@xmath10 .",
    "however , given the scatter in the relationship between ir luminosity and the continuum - to - line ratio , this is at best a weak argument in favor of gravitational lensing .",
    "detecting the massive reservoir of molecular gas in pss 2322 + 1944 is one of the required ( although not sufficient ) elements for demonstrating the existence of active star formation co - eval with the agn activity in this high-@xmath59 qso .",
    "however , the possibility of gravitational lensing in pss 2322 + 1944 complicates the physical analysis . an argument in favor of lensing is the relatively low velocity dispersion for the co emission .",
    "the observed value of 200 km s@xmath14 is typical for a galaxy potential , but is low for a group potential , as might be expected if the observed co line was the sum of emission from the host galaxies of a qso pair at @xmath0 .",
    "if the system is strongly gravitationally lensed , then judicious use of a lens model could elucidate structure in the source plane on finer physical scales ( @xmath65 pc ) than can be obtained normally ( yun et al .",
    "1997 ; lewis et al .",
    "sensitive , high resolution observations of the co 21 emission from 2322 + 1944 are planned to confirm , and better resolve , the molecular line emitting regions , while observations of higher order transitions at high spatial resolution are planned to better constrain the co excitation conditions .",
