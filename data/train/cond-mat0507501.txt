    "it is now well known that the fluctuations of electric current contain valuable information both on the discreetness of the charge and on the quantum properties of transport  @xcite .",
    "many studies of these fluctuations , both experimental and theroretical , have been done on systems in a stationary regime , with constant or time - periodic voltage biases .",
    "we consider here a non - stationnary problem , where a voltage pulse is used to inject a given charge in a conductor , and call this process `` time - controlled charge injection '' .",
    "such a real - time transfer of charge might prove of great interest for applications , for example as a tool for the transfert of information .",
    "the current fluctuations also play an important role in the problem of time - controlled charge injection , as these fluctuations should be made as low as possible to transfer the charge as precisely as possible .",
    "an interesting area to study time - controlled charge injection consists of conductors with strongly correlated electrons . indeed , in these systems , the elementary excitations are collective electronic excitations , and may have a charge @xmath2 which is only a fraction of the `` elementary '' charge @xmath3",
    ". we will be particularly interested in edge states of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) for lauglhin fractions , where elementary excitations have a charge @xmath4 , with @xmath5 an integer ( the most accessible charge being @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "this problem is interesting on its own from a theoretical perspective , as it allows to see how a system with strongly correlated electrons behaves in a non - stationary setup .",
    "it is also interesting for potential experimental applications , as the injection of a well controlled charge , e.g. a _ unique _ electron , in an edge state of the fqhe is an important experimental challenge , which could prove an useful tool in the quantum information domain for example .",
    "in the case where electrons are uncorrelated ( normal metal conductors ) , this problem has been studied by levitov and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "defining the faraday flux @xmath7 , they have shown that the mean transmitted charge @xmath8 is simply proportional to the flux ( ohm s law ) , @xmath9 , but that the charge fluctuations @xmath10 are in general logarithmically divergent , except for `` integer '' values of the flux @xmath11 ( with @xmath5 an integer ) where these fluctuations are finite .",
    "they have related this behavior to the anderson orthogonality catastrophe  @xcite.the goal of this report is to study this problem in the case where the charge is transfered into an edge state of the fqhe , or more generally in a chiral luttinger liquid .",
    "the setup of this paper is as follows .",
    "the system is described in section  [ sec : description ] . in section  [ sec : pert ] , we consider the case of the pertrubative regime , where the tunneling between the normal metal and the edge state is low .",
    "the convergence of the mean charge and of its fluctuations is studied , and explicit formul are given within the adiabatic approximation , whose validity is confirmed by numerical calculations . in section  [ sec : allorders ] , we give non - perturbative results for the special case of electron tunneling in an edge state of the fqhe with filling factor @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : others ] , some perspectives are discussed , like the relevance of our results for other systems , and conclusions are given .",
    "the system we consider is composed of a normal metal ( non - interacting electrons , with fermi liquid behavior ) close to an edge state of a 2d electron gas in the fqhe regime .",
    "a voltage pulse @xmath0 is applied between the two conductors , which leads to the tunneling of electrons .",
    "the fqhe regime is characterized by the filling factor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an odd integer .",
    "note that the case @xmath14 correspond to the integer quantum hall effect , where there are no correlations between electrons and the edge state describe a fermi liquid .",
    "we expect thus to recover , when we take @xmath15 , the results of levitov et al .    .",
    "]    we call @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) the electron annihilation operator at the tunneling point in conductor 1 ( conductor 2 , the edge state)- see fig.[fig : setup ]",
    ". using peierls substitution to have the voltage pulse as a vector potential only , we have the following tunneling hamiltonian between the two conductors : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the tunneling amplitude and @xmath20 is the time - dependent faraday flux . similarly , the tunneling current is given by : @xmath21 the quantities we need to calculate are the mean transmitted charge @xmath8 : @xmath22 and its fluctuations @xmath23 : @xmath24 the system being out of equilibrium , we use the keldysh formalism , introducing a time contour going first from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( upper branch , @xmath27 ) and then going back from @xmath26 to @xmath25 ( lower branch , @xmath28 ) , and using the time ordering operator @xmath29 along this contour  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the mean transmitted charge and its fluctuations in the tunneling regime , where @xmath30 .",
    "this allows us to get the results by calculating only the lowest order in the tunneling amplitude @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath30 ensures the system is in the tunneling regime for any finite value of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , for electron tunneling from a normal metal to an edge state of the fqhe with filling factor @xmath31 , one has in the tunneling limit the tunneling current @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is proportionnal to the applied voltage @xmath34 . as @xmath35 , it is clear that when @xmath36 the tunneling current goes to 0 and can thus be calculatd perturbatively .",
    "note that the situation would be different for tunneling of fractionaly charged excitations between two edge states of the same fqhe fluid , where @xmath37 brings the system out of the tunneling regime    as we are considering the system in the tunneling regime , we can restrict ourselves to the lowest order contribution in the tunneling amplitude @xmath19 . at order @xmath38 , we have for the mean transmitted charge : @xmath39 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hdef ] ) and ( [ eq : idef ] ) , with standard properties of the keldysh green functions , and parity properties , we can write this expression as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the standard green function for conductor @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) : @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , we get for the charge fluctuations ( eq .  ( [ eq : q2 ] ) ) : @xmath45\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that the term `` -1 '' next to the cosine has been introduced to regularize the expression .",
    "this regularizing term is needed because we have permuted the order of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 integrals , and is not needed if the @xmath46 integral is performed before the @xmath47 integral , as @xmath48 .",
    "( [ eq : icalc ] ) and ( [ eq : scalc ] ) will allow us to study the properties of the charge injection . on these formul , we see that both the injected charge and its fluctuations are obtained with two elements : the green functions product @xmath49 , which contains all the information about the two conductors , and a kernel obtained by integrating over @xmath47 a function of the faraday flux @xmath50 , which contains all the information about the voltage pulse @xmath0 .",
    "to study the convergence / divergence of the time integrals for the charge and its fluctuations , we need the time behavior of these two elements .",
    "note that as we consider tunneling through a single point contact , the normal metal can be mapped  @xcite to a chiral luttinger liquid with parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the green functions at zero temperature are simply  @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a short length cutoff , and @xmath54 the filling factor of the fqhe conductor . introducing @xmath55 , with @xmath56 an integer , we see that the large time behavior of the real and imaginary part of @xmath57 is : @xmath58 ( the imaginary part does not contain a @xmath59 term as this term includes a @xmath60 factor which is zero ) .",
    "we now turn to the large time behavior of the kernels involving the flux @xmath50 . for the mean charge ,",
    "it is given by @xmath61 .",
    "by hypothesis , the voltage pulse @xmath0 is important only in a finite time domain , of width @xmath62 .",
    "this means that for @xmath63 , and for a @xmath47 interval of the order of @xmath46 , we have : @xmath64 we have thus @xmath65 for @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a constant .",
    "similarly , we have for the kernel of the charge fluctuations , @xmath68 $ ] , @xmath69 . both the kernels @xmath70 and @xmath71 have thus a linear dependence in @xmath46 for large @xmath46 , except for the special values of the flux @xmath11 ( with @xmath72 ) where they are constant for large @xmath46 .    combining the large time behavior of the green functions and of the kernels",
    ", we see that the integrand for the mean charge ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : icalc ] ) ) behaves for large @xmath46 as : @xmath73 while for the charge fluctuations ( eq .  ( [ eq : scalc ] ) ) we have : @xmath74 let us first check that this is compatible with the known results for non - interacting electrons . in this case , one has @xmath15 and thus @xmath75 .",
    "we see then that the mean charge integral is always converging , while the charge fluctuations integral has a logarithmic divergence , except for @xmath11 , and we recover thus the results of levitov et al .",
    "turning now to interacting electrons , one has @xmath12 with @xmath76 an odd integer , and thus @xmath56 is an integer with @xmath77 . in this case , we see that the mean charge integral is as before always converging , and that the charge fluctuations integral is also always converging , independently of the value of the flux @xmath78",
    "! this means that , because of the electronic correlations , the divergence of the charge fluctuations is removed .",
    "it is possible to go further and to get explicit formul for the integrals of the mean injected charge and its fluctuations .",
    "for simplicity , we will restrict ourselves to the case @xmath79 , but the results shown here can be extended to any value of @xmath80 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the green function product is : @xmath81 let us first consider the integral for the mean transmitted charge ( eq .  ( [ eq : icalc ] ) ) , which involves the imaginary part of the green function product . on eq .",
    "( [ eq : greenproduct ] ) , we see that this part is important in a time domain of the order of @xmath82 , and then quickly decreases to 0 for @xmath83 as @xmath84 . for the @xmath46 integral giving the mean transmitted charge",
    ", we can thus consider that times up to @xmath85 only contribute importantly to the integral . in the kernel @xmath70",
    ", time @xmath46 appears in the bounds @xmath86 of the @xmath87 integral in the sinus .",
    "as the short time cutoff @xmath82 is much smaller that the typical time of variation of @xmath87 , the function @xmath87 can be considered as constant in this integral , giving @xmath88 .",
    "the mean charge is then : @xmath89 the @xmath46 integral in  ( [ eq : iadia1 ] ) is simply the formula for the mean tunneling current when a constant voltage @xmath90 ( with a given @xmath47 ) is applied .",
    "we have thus performed an _ adiabatic _",
    "approximation , valid because of the rapid decrease of the green function product . performing the time integral , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : greenproduct ] ) , we get the result : @xmath91 we see that the mean transmitted charge is not proportional to the total flux @xmath78 , but rather to the integral of the cube of the voltage pulse @xmath0 .",
    "this means that , for a voltage pulse of given shape whose flux is varied by an overall scale factor only , the mean transmitted charge varies as the cube of the flux @xmath78 .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the non - linear relation between voltage and current for tunneling in a luttinger liquid .",
    "the presence of the cutoff @xmath53 in the formula is typical of electron tunneling in a luttinger liquid .",
    "note that for another filling factor @xmath12 , the result would be proportional to the integral of @xmath92 .",
    "turning now to the charge fluctuations , one could expect to obtain similar results : from eq .",
    "( [ eq : greenproduct ] ) , we see that the real part of the product of the green functions is important for @xmath85 only , and decreases rapidly to 0 as @xmath93 . however , when @xmath90 is not large enough the adiabatic approximation breaks down , because @xmath94 , which means that the contribution of the time interval up to @xmath85 may vanish .",
    "we have thus to distinguish between two regimes , small flux @xmath95 and large flux @xmath78 .    for the small @xmath78 regime let us consider a voltage pulse @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is of fixed shape and unit flux ( @xmath98 ) , and @xmath95 .",
    "the cosine in the kernel of the charge fluctuations @xmath71 can then be developped at second order , giving @xmath99 .",

    "the charge fluctuations are thus proportional to @xmath100 for small @xmath78 , contrarily to the mean transmitted charge which varies as @xmath101 .    in the other regime , with a larger flux @xmath78",

    "in the previous section , we have shown that , except for the charge fluctuations at small @xmath78 , we obtain a very good approximation of the exact results by using an adiabatic approximation , where the transmitted charge due to the voltage pulse @xmath0 is computed by integrating over @xmath46 the stationnary current @xmath109 due to @xmath110 .",
    "as the adiabatic approximation is related to the rapid decrease of the green function product @xmath57 , and as higher orders of the tunneling current imply higher powers of this product , we expect the adiabatic approximation to be valid in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "we will thus compute non - pertubative results for the mean charge and its fluctuations starting from non - pertrubative results for the stationnary tunneling current and noise . because this method implies the calculation of stationnary current only",
