    "with the advent of sophisticated advanced technologies , modern research in atomic physics demands many high precision atomic calculations . some of the prominent examples in this context are , studies of parity non - conservation ( pnc ) and permanent electric dipole moments ( edms ) @xcite , estimation of the uncertainties for the frequency standard measurements @xcite , probing variation of the fine structure constant @xcite , extracting nuclear charge radii and nuclear moments @xcite , providing atomic data for the astrophysical investigations @xcite et cetera . in the last two decades , the coupled - cluster ( cc )",
    "method for the single valence systems in the four - component relativistic framework have been extensively employed for the above mentioned research problems with a great success @xcite .",
    "in contrast , such cc methods are scanty for calculating the excited state properties of the systems with closed - shell configurations as far as the four - component relativistic approach with the explicit form of the spherical atomic potentials are concerned .",
    "there have been development of cc methods in the fock - space formalism to calculate these states @xcite , however such approaches suffer from two serious problems : ( i ) it increases the computational complexity when applied to estimate the matrix elements of an operator and ( ii ) it yields intruder state problem while increasing the size of the model space @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the low - lying odd parity forbidden transitions among the singlet states of the systems like mg , ca , sr , al@xmath1 , in@xmath1 , hg@xmath1 , yb etc .",
    "are considered for the atomic clock experiments @xcite .",
    "similarly , atomic systems like xe , ba , ra , yb , hg , rn , etc . have been considered for the pnc and edm studies @xcite for which high precision calculations in the relativistic method are indispensable .",
    "coincidently , the excited states involved in the above research problems can be created by exciting one electron from an occupied orbital ( hole ( h ) ) to a unoccupied orbital ( particle ( p ) ) which is customarily referred to as 1h-1p excitation in the literature .    among various popular many - body methods , equation - of - motion coupled - cluster ( eomcc ) theory is one of the better suited methods to obtain the excited states @xcite .",
    "this method is formulated in the similar way as the excitation operators defined for the configuration - interaction ( ci ) method , however the excitations are carried out with respect to the exact state in contrast to the model reference state of the ci method .",
    "uniqueness of this approach is that the energy differences between the atomic states are estimated directly by casting the schrdinger equations in a particular form .",
    "many non - relativistic calculations on the ionization potentials ( ips ) , electron affinities ( eas ) and excitation energies ( ees ) in different atomic and molecular systems have been reported in the eomcc framework @xcite .",
    "recently , this method has been developed to determine the first and second ips of many closed - shell systems using the atomic integrals in the four - component relativistic mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , all the above eomcc calculations are carried out using the molecular codes considering special group symmetry properties . in this work ,",
    "we discuss about the implementation of the ee determining eomcc method ( referred to as ee - eomcc method ) based on the four - component relativistic mechanics and expressing the atomic potentials explicitly in the spherical polar coordinates .",
    "also , all the physical operators are represented in terms of the racah angular momentum operators for which we make use of the reduced matrix elements in order to reduce the computational scalability .    in order to corroborate the successful implementation of the excited states determining ee - eomcc method",
    ", we calculate ees of transitions among the low - lying states in few ne - like systems that are of immense astrophysical interest .",
    "transition lines in the range 10.5 - 21.2 @xmath2 of fe xvii are observed in the solar corona @xcite .",
    "it is also found from the stellar binary capella observation that fe xvii is one of the important constituents in the stellar corona @xcite and transition lines from this ion have also been observed from various astrophysical objects by many others @xcite . the above lines and transitions from co xviii and ni xix are also very important for the astrophysical and tokamak plasma studies @xcite .",
    "the bottom line for the referral of these astrophysical observation is that the above transition lines could be of potential candidates for probing temporal variation of the fine structure constant ( @xmath0 ) . in our recent works",
    ", we have provided data to probe @xmath0 variation by employing a single reference cc method formulated in the fock - space approach for the f- and cl - like cr , fe and ni ions @xcite .",
    "we intend , here , to estimate the sensitivity coefficients in the considered ions for the investigation of @xmath0 variation whose magnitudes would magnitudes would gauge the significance of the relativistic effects and can be undertaken for their detection .",
    "probing different absorption systems , associated with the quasi - stellar objects like quasars , can provide useful information regarding the speculated temporal variability of @xmath0 .",
    "these absorption systems that are present at different redshifts contain many metallic and non - metallic ions of various elements .",
    "a small fraction of the absorption systems , that are detected through the analysis of the quasars spectra , could be intrinsically associated to the quasars themselves .",
    "investigations of the broad absorptions line systems ( bals ) of this region reveal that the chemical compositions are usually from the highly ionized species @xcite .",
    "next to bals , the most important regions are the intervening absorption systems which can be further classified into various regions depending upon the column density of the neutral hydrogen ( h ) atoms @xcite .",
    "the absorptions lines that are coming out of these systems are red - shifted due to the cosmological expansion of the universe and are related to the cosmological redshift parameter ( @xmath3 ) by the following relation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the wavelength at the time of emission in the rest frame of the absorption system . with the precise knowledge of the redshift of an absorption line , one can extract the information about the subtle temporal variation in @xmath0 after the cautious consideration of the systematic uncertainties associated with the observation @xcite .",
    "these absorption lines are observed with the advanced telescope such as high - resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) at the keck observatory or the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) for the investigation of variation in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the anticipated tiny variation in @xmath0 from the present laboratory value @xmath6 can be inferred by combining the calculated relativistic sensitivity coefficients ( @xmath7s ) of different atomic transitions with the observed spectral lines from the quasars @xcite . since the energy of an atomic level scales at the order of @xmath8 in the relativistic theory , the frequency of an atomic transition will depend on the value of @xmath0 at a given time .",

    "it has been shown that instead of considering two transitions from a particular atomic system ( alkali doublet ( ad ) method ) , it is advantageous to compare as many as transitions from a number of systems ( many - multiplet ( mm ) method ) to yield an order of magnitude improvement in the detection of change in @xmath0 value ( @xmath14 ) from the observations @xcite . generally , one compares the measured velocity profile in the mm method to infer tiny shifts in the transitions , having different magnitudes of @xmath7 parameters , to obtain stringent value of @xmath15 from a best possible fit . in this method",
    "the change in the transition frequency between two states of an atomic system with respect to an arbitrary variation in @xmath0 , quantified as @xmath16 , can be given by @xmath17 such that @xmath18 corresponds to rate of change of @xmath19 , which is independent of @xmath20 , and known as the sensitivity coefficient for @xmath0 variation . in the mm method , the commonly used relation for the extraction of change in @xmath0 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the velocity of light , @xmath23 corresponds to the change in the velocity profile of the absorption lines that are related to the wavelengths of the atomic transitions .",
    "therefore for probing @xmath0 variation using the mm method , it is imperative to find out @xmath7 parameters in many possible transitions of the atomic systems that are highly abundant in the astrophysical objects like the considered ions in the present work .",

    "<S> we employ this method to calculate excitation energies of many low - lying states in a few ne - like highly charged ions , such as cr xv , fe xvii , co xviii and ni xix ions , and compare them against their corresponding experimental values to demonstrate the accomplishment of the eomcc implementation . </S>",
