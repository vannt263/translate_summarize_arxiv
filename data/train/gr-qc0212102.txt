    "one of the most important concepts in the modern quantum field theory is gauge field .",
    "this concept was introduced @xcite on the basis of gauge symmetry , i.e. invariance under localized ( depending on space - time points ) symmetry groups .",
    "later it became clear that gauge theory may be naturally formulated on the basis of such mathematical formalism as connections in fiber bundles and their curvatures .",
    "gravity was from the very beginning formulated as theory of curved ( pseudo-)riemannian spaces .",
    "fiber bundles turned out to be also efficient mathematical formalism for gravitational fields .    here",
    "we shall give a short survey of an alternative mathematical background for both gauge theory and gravity , namely path group ( @xcite , see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "path group ( pg ) is a generalization of translation group differing from the latter in that it may be applied to particles in external gauge and gravitational fields .",
    "formally path group may be defined as a set of certain classes of continuous curves in minkowski space ( generalization on the case of paths in an arbitrary group space is possible ) .",
    "concept of pg came up as development of the suvegesh s groupoid of parallel transports @xcite ( a groupoid differs from a group in that not any pair of its elements may be multiplied ) .",
    "the goal was to find a universal group such that parallel transports in various space - times be its representations .",
    "the concept of pg may be obtained also in the attempt to globalize infinitesimal translations of a tangent space to a curved space - time .",
    "pg arises then instead of the usual translation group since curvature makes translations in different directions not commutative ( see @xcite for other types of non - commutative translations ) .",
    "pg reduces geometry to algebra : various geometries ( gauge and gravitational fields ) are nothing else than representations of the universal pg . in case of gauge fields",
    "the representation is simpler in that lorentz group may be factorized out . in case of gravitational fields both lorentz and pg ( united to give the generalized poincar group )",
    "essencially participate in the constructions .",
    "the natural character of pg is seen from the facts that it allows 1 )  to give a group - theoretical interpretation of covariant derivatives ( both for gravitational or / and gauge fields ) as generators of relevant representations of pg , 2 )  to formulate and prove a non - abelian version of stokes theorem and 3 )  to reduce the path integral in a curved space - time to the path integral in the flat space ( a quantum version of equivalence principle )",
    "an element of path group ( pg ) is defined as a _ class of curves _ in minkowski space constructed in such a way that the classes form a group . for curves in minkowski space ,",
    "@xmath0 , operation of multiplication @xmath1 may be naturally defined as passing of two curves one after another and inversion @xmath2 as passing the same curve in the opposite direction .",
    "however , the set of all continuous curves is not , in respect to these operation , a group : 1 )  not all pairs of curves may be multiplied to give a continuous curve , 2 )  multiplication ( when defined ) is not assotiative and 3 )  product of a curve by its inverse does not yield a unit element ( i.e. such one that multiplication by it does not change an arbitrary curve ) .    to correct the second defect , one may consider differently parametrized curves to be equivalent ( and include them in the same class ) . to correct the third defect ,",
    "one may consider equivalent those curves which differ by inclusion of ` appendices ' of the form @xmath3 ( and go over to else wider classes of curves ) .",
    "at last , the first defect is overcome if we include in the same class those curves which differ by general shift : @xmath4 ( see figure ) .",

    "a path may be presented by any curve from the corresponding class .",
    "if the curves which differ by general shift are not considered equivalent , we have more narrow classes .",
    "the end points are the same for all curves in such a class .",
    "it may be therefore called a _ pinned path _ and denoted as @xmath10_x^{x'}$ ] ( or @xmath11 ) where @xmath12 is the initial and @xmath13 final point of any curve presenting the given pinned path .",
    "all pinned paths form a groupoid @xmath14 since not any pair of pinned paths may be multiplied .",
    "pinned paths are often convenient for constructing representations of the group @xmath9 of free paths .",
    "it is important that the pair @xmath15 of a free path and a point unambiguously determines the pinned path @xmath11 starting in @xmath12 and having the same shape as @xmath7 .    paths may be defined @xcite for an arbitrary group space @xmath16 leading to the group of paths @xmath17 in @xmath16 ( the role of general shift is played in this case by right shift in the group ) .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves by considering only the path group in minkowski space , @xmath18 .",
    "this will prove to be sufficient for applications to gauge theory and gravity .",
    "theory of free elementary particles is governed by the group of translations .",
    "starting from path group instead of the translation group we obtain theory of particles in an external gauge field .",
    "gauge fields thus arise independently of the idea of gauge symmetry .",
    "the key point for constructing theory of particles is that path group @xmath9 ( generalized translations ) acts on minkowski space @xmath19 transitively .",
    "an important consequence is that particles have to be described by the induced representations of path group .",
    "theory of elementary particles may be constructed starting from a certain group and implying the requirement of locality @xcite ( see @xcite for an analogous construction ) . in our",

    "the space @xmath25 will serve in our case as a localization space .",
    "the general scheme of constructing theory of particles starting from the group and localization space is following @xcite .",
    "let theory of particles be governed by the group @xmath9 ( which may be symmetry or kinematic group ) and characterized by localization in the space @xmath19 ( i.e. the subspace of states @xmath29 is defined in which the particle is localized in an arbitrary point @xmath12 of @xmath19 ) . then the group @xmath9 must act on the space @xmath19 ( so that @xmath30 for @xmath20 , @xmath31 ) , and this action must be in accord with the representation @xmath32 of @xmath9 acting in the space of the particle s states : @xmath33 a representation @xmath34 possessing this property is called imprimitive .",
    "assume that the action of @xmath9 on @xmath19 is transitive ( this may be done without loss of generality , because otherwise we may divide @xmath19 in imprimitive subspaces ) .",

    "the representation @xmath34 acts then transitively on the set of subspaces @xmath35 . according to the imprimitivity theorem @xcite , such a representation ( transitive but imprimitive ) is equivalent to the representation induced from some representation @xmath36 of the subgroup @xmath37 : @xmath38    this gives a receipt for constructing theory of local particles . knowing the group @xmath9 and the space @xmath25 of localization we can restore the representation @xmath39 acting in the space of states @xmath40 of the particle ( and",
    "therefore can restore the space @xmath40 itself ) . to do this",

    "may be achieved in the following way @xcite .",
    "vectors of the carrier space @xmath40 of the induced representation @xmath39 are presented by functions @xmath41 on @xmath9 with values in the carrier space @xmath42 of @xmath36 with the additional _ structure condition _ imposed on the functions : @xmath43 the induced representation acts on these functions by left shifts : @xmath44    the representation @xmath36 is arbitrary in this construction .",
    "it describes _ internal degrees of freedom _ of the particle which it possesses even if its localization in @xmath19 is fixed .",
    "states of the particle are described by the functions @xmath41 depending on elements of the group @xmath9 . in our case",
    "these are paths , so we arrive to the non - local formalism of path - dependent wave functions .",
    "it is a group - theoretical version of mandelstam s path - dependent fields @xcite .    however , despite of the non - local form , the theory must be essentially local because the requirement of locality was imposed from the very beginning .",
    "therefore , _ explicitly local form _ of the representation must exist .    for constructing this form",
    "we need an extension @xmath45 of the representation @xmath36 onto the group @xmath9 such that @xmath46 for arbitrary @xmath31 and @xmath47 .",
    "local wave functions @xmath48 may be defined then as @xmath49 where the point @xmath20 corresponds to the coset @xmath27 .",

    "we shall illustrate this approach starting from the usual description of a gauge field by vector - potential .",

    "the representation of loops may be expressed as @xmath56 and the expansion of this representation onto the whole group @xmath9 ( with the properties specified above ) as @xmath57 .",
    "this determines a local form of the representation @xmath39 which is given by the following elegant formula : @xmath58 another very convenient form of the same ( or rather equivalent ) representation may be expressed in terms of only free paths : @xmath59 the covariant derivatives are therefore generators of the representation @xmath34 of path group ( just as ordinary derivatives are generators of translations ) . by this",
    "the _ group - theoretical interpretation of covariant derivatives _ is given .",
    "the representation of the group of loops , @xmath36 , provides in this scheme a non - local description of a gauge field . this description is better than local descriptions by vector - potential and by field stregth .",
    "indeed , the first of these descriptions is redundant since various vector - potentials may correspond to the same physical situation , and the second is insufficient because non - local topological effects ( such as aharonov - bohm effect ) can not be described by field strength .",
    "the ` intermediate ' non - local description by @xmath36 is adequate .",
    "the scheme presented here leads to gauge fields without usage of gauge transformations and the idea of gauge invariance . _",
    "gauge transformations _ arise in this scheme as presentation of _ arbitrariness in the local description _ of gauge fields by vector - potentials .",

    "one more evidence of natural character of the non - local path - dependent presentation of gauge fields is the non - abelian version of stokes theorem @xcite .",
