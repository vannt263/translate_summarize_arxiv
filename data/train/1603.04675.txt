    "morphological instability of a surface of an ultra - thin solid film and film dewetting are important from the technology viewpoint , as well as from the viewpoint of basic physics .",
    "these phenomena were intensely studied in a semiconductor - on - semiconductor , metal - on - semiconductor , and metal - on - metal systems @xcite .",
    "however , only for former systems were the mathematical models sufficiently developed and were able to help clarify the key mechanisms by which the film becomes unstable and dewets ; see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .    in this paper ,",
    "building upon the just cited and closely related works , we develop a physico - mathematical model for the analysis of a morphology evolution of an ultra - thin metal films ( thickness 5 to 30 monolayers ( ml ) ( 1.5 - 10 nm ) ) on a semiconductor or metal substrates .",
    "our model accounts for three effects that are believed to play a major roles in a film instability and dewetting : the quantum size effect ( qse ) @xcite , the surface energy anisotropy , and the surface stress .",
    "the advantage of a mathematical model is that it allows to separate the physical effects and thus clarify the contribution of each effect in the overall picture .",
    "this is seldom possible in experiment .",
    "for instance , the role in the initial surface instability of the surface energy that oscillates in the film thickness @xcite was not studied in detail .",
    "this paper partially fills this gap",
    ". we will refer to the surface energy oscillation as the qse oscillation .",
    "( such oscillation emerges primarily as a result of discreteness of the electronic energy bands due to the confinement at the film / vacuum and the film / substrate interfaces .",
    "if the fermi wavelength @xmath0 has a commensurate relation with the monolayer height @xmath1 then , as the film thickness grows , new bands emerge under fermi level periodically , producing oscillations in the interface energy with period around @xmath2 .",
    "another source of the surface energy oscillation is the friedel oscillations in the electron density , which result in an oscillatory mean - field potential for electrons .",
    "the periodicity of the friedel oscillation is also around @xmath2 . ) to the best of our knowledge , the existing stability results @xcite for the ultra - thin metal films are based on the analysis of the second derivative ( with respect to the film thickness ) of the free - energy function .",
    "such analysis is not without drawbacks , e.g. , the perturbation wavelength and its characteristic development time scale are not easy to predict . the partial differential equation ( pde)-based model allows not only the calculation of these quantities ( that are important in self - assembly ) , but also a computation of the evolution of the nano - pits @xcite and the retraction of the film edge @xcite .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows . in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] we first present the general form of the governing pde ; this pde is the classical mullins surface diffusion equation , which includes the three above - mentioned effects . 100 nm ) .",
    "however , the theory does not have a limitation on a thickness _ per se_.",
    "the base assumption in the theory is that there is a mobile adsorbate on the crystal surface , i.e. the top layer of the crystal is  fluid \" , and the geometrical quantities such as the curvature can be defined for the surface .",
    "the top layer is usually considered to be one to three atoms deep . thus the theory is applicable to thinner films .",
    "it must be noted here that the dewetting of the ultra - thin metallic films is apparently driven by surface diffusion , as the films develop a faceted pinholes that extend from the surface down to the substrate , and the pinholes are surrounded at their surface perimeter by the characteristic high rims formed out of the film material that diffused from the pinhole bottom @xcite . ]",
    "then we focus on each effect separately and arrive to their mathematical formulations , that are next inserted into the governing pde . in sec .",
    "[ derivepde ] we employ a perturbation method and derive the final form of the pde . in this paper",
    "we present only those terms of the pde that contribute to the linearized form . the linear stability analysis ( lsa ) is performed in sec .",
    "[ lsa ] ; here we again focus separately on each effect and then take a brief look at the situation where all three effects are present .",
    "section [ concl ] contains the conclusions .",
    "the starting point for the model is mullins surface diffusion equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the height of the surface of the thin film above the substrate , @xmath5 the coordinates in the substrate plane , @xmath6 the surface laplacian , @xmath7 the diffusion constant ( @xmath8 is the adatom volume , @xmath9 the adatom diffusivity , @xmath10 the surface density of the adatoms , @xmath11 the boltzmann s factor ) , and @xmath12 the chemical potential ; here @xmath13 is the surface energy , @xmath14 the functional derivative and the integral is over the film surface . also let @xmath15 be the coordinate normal to the substrate plane .",

    ". thus at weak anisotropy the large thicknesses are stable , but at strong anisotropy they are unstable . increasing the compressive stress at either a weak or a strong anisotropy ( figures [ kmax_vs_epsstar_h0_qse_anisotropy_stress_111](b , d ) ) has the effect of nearly equally stabilizing the large thicknesses ; notice that the only apparent difference between the panels ( b ) and ( d ) is the magnitude of @xmath155 ( it is larger at strong anisotropy , panel ( d ) ) .",
