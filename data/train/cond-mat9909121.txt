    "influence of a weak quenched disorder on magnetic second order phase transition remains the subject of much interest .",
    "one of the central problems here is the answer to the questions : ( i ) do the critical exponents ( of a homogeneous magnet ) change under dilution ( by a nonmagnetic component ) ? and , if yes , ( ii ) how do they change ?    replying the first question it was argued @xcite almost 25 years ago that if the heat capacity critical exponent @xmath5 of the pure ( undiluted ) system is positive , i.e. the heat capacity diverges at the critical point , then a quenched disorder causes changes in the critical exponents .",
    "this statement is known as harris criterion .",
    "later , for a large class of @xmath6dimensional disordered systems it was proven that the correlation length critical exponent @xmath7 must satisfy the bound @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "both statements focus attention towards studies of the @xmath4 ising model , where the typical numerical values of the above exponents , together with the magnetic susceptibility and the order parameter critical exponents in the pure case read : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the reply on the second question concerning the numerical values of the critical exponents of @xmath4 weakly diluted quenched ising model ( random ising model - rim ) is more complicated .",
    "below we briefly review some experimental theoretical and numerical @xcite results for the critical exponents of @xmath4 magnets described by the rim . although the statements of refs .",
    "@xcite should hold in principle for arbitrary weak disorder , the new critical exponents appear only in a region of temperatures controlled by the concentration of the nonmagnetic component .",
    "such a region not always may be reached in practice , where only the effective exponents are observed @xcite .",
    "theoretical results are due to the application of the renormalization group approach .",
    "these are numerous for the asymptotic values of critical exponents but quite seldom for the effective ones @xcite .",

    "the experimental evidence of the new critical behavior at a weak quenched dilution was the nuclear magnetic resonance measurement of the magnetization in @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the value of the magnetisation exponent @xmath22 was found to differ strongly from that in undiluted sample ( see table [ table_experiment ] for details ) . in a few years",

    "the corresponding values of the random fixed point coordinates , critical exponents and eigenvalues of the stability matrix are listed in the table [ tab8 ] .",
    "one can see that increasing the order of approximation one reaches convergent results , compatible with experimental and theoretical data ( see sec .",

    "the deviation of our 4loop result ( see table [ tab5 ] ) from the most accurate one obtained within massive field rg scheme on the basis of 6loop expansion for @xmath22functions and 7loop expansion for @xmath28functions @xcite is within parts of a percent .",
    "this can be considered as a upper bound for the accuracy of rim results . here",
    "the comparison of our data with the results of 4loop massive scheme results @xcite yields an accuracy of several percents . since the series for @xmath22 and @xmath28function ( [ 11])([14 ] ) are sign  alternating , the unknown exact stable point coordinates and critical exponents must lie between the 3 and 4loop values giving the same estimate ( see appendix a about adjusting a free parameter for the fastest convergence of results ) .",
    "thus , we conclude the accuracy of the rim critical exponents obtained in our study to be of order of several percents .",
    "a peculiarity of the table [ tab8 ] is that in 5loop order the applied resummation technique does not lead to a real root for the random fixed point .",
    "it is expected that the applications of more sophisticated resummation procedures incorporating the higher order behavior , still unavailable , will permit an improvement of the estimates for the critical exponents in the 2 , 3 and 4loop level as well as to obtain them in the 5loop level .",
    "however , it is not excluded that the absence of a fixed point solution on the 5loop level might be connected with a ( possible ) borel - nonsummability of the series under consideration . in this case",
    "the 4loop approximation will be an `` optimal truncation '' for the resummed perturbation theory series , similar to the nonresummed asymptotic series , e.g. in the @xmath36expansion of @xmath2symmetric @xmath1 model , where `` naive '' interpretation of the series truncated by @xmath128 term leads to the best ( optimal ) result .",
    "on the other hand , numerical and analytic studies of a toy model of a disordered system @xcite revealed two possible regimes of the high - order behavior : the first one corresponds to a borel - summable series whereas the second one does not correspond to a borel - summable series .",
    "numerical studies of up to 200 terms of the expansion @xcite resulted in the conclusion , that the convergence of the borel - resummed results depends on the strength of disorder ( relation of the couplings @xmath129 ) .",
    "the convergence of the numerical data of table [ tab8 ] is evidence of the fact that the fixed point values @xmath130 in @xmath4 lie in a region , where the resummed series gives reliable information . in any case , on the basis of the above analysis one can definitely say : while for the pure ising model the @xmath36expansion and the 3d approach analysis of the rg functions are of equal usefulness , an interpretation of these functions in the diluted model can be done only within the framework of the 3d approach .",
    "the application of the @xmath3expansion remains to be valid only near the upper critical dimension @xmath131 .",
    "this conclusion holds at least within the discussed resummation schemes .",
    "if one is not within the asymptotic region of the stable fixed point power laws for the physical quantities may only apply with effective exponents . the critical behavior is then to be understood as a crossover behavior between the uncritical background behavior and the true asymptotic behavior . as it has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite this has in principle nothing to do with crossovers between special fixed points ( e.g. the pure one and the random one ) .",
    "however , depending on the nonuniversal parameters entering the nonasymptotic behavior , the crossover may be more or less influenced by the unstable pure fixed point .",
    "the effective exponents are defined by logarithmic derivatives of corresponding thermodynamical quantities with respect to reduced temperature @xmath26 @xcite . in the rg scheme",
    "they are calculated in the region where couplings have not yet reached their asymptotic ( fixed point ) values and depend on the flow parameter @xmath71 .",
    "for instance the magnetic susceptibility effective exponent @xmath132 is defined by : @xmath133 where the second part is proportional to the @xmath22functions and comes from the change of the amplitude part of the susceptibility . in order to proceed we have to neglect this part since we do not know the amplitude function in the same orders as the field - theoretical functions for the exponents .",
    "moreover , the contribution of the amplitude function to the crossover seems to be small , at least in other cases @xcite .",
    "this approximation has also been used in the earlier work on diluted models @xcite .",
    "the flow parameter @xmath134 may be related to the temperature via the matching condition @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "however , we discuss the effective exponents as functions of the flow parameter",
    ". then the effective exponents are simply given by the expressions for the asymptotic exponents ( [ 10 ] ) but with replacing the fixed point values of the couplings @xmath137 and @xmath138 by the solutions of the flow equations ( [ 6 ] ) : @xmath139    these solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ flows.eps ] for several initial conditions .",
    "there are shown the two unstable fixed points : g ( gaussian fixed point ) and p ( pure ising fixed point ) and the stable random fixed point r , with both couplings non zero . in the background region the couplings are expected to be small thus all the flows shown start near the gaussian fixed point with different ratios @xmath140 ( curves 1 to 6 except curve 2 ) .",
    "curve 1 is the separatrix connecting the fixed point g with p , and curve 2 is the separatrix connecting p with r. all curves starting with a negative coupling @xmath119 remain negative but the dependence might be nonmonotonous ( see curve 6 ) .",
    "thus several scenarios for the values of the effective critical exponents are possible ( see figs .",
    "[ nu.eps ] , [ gamma.eps ] ) .    both in experiment as well as in computer simulations ( see tabs .",
    "[ table_experiment ] , [ table_mc ] ) exponents reported differ and even exceed the known asymptotic theoretical values .",
    "this nonuniversal behavior might be related to the possible nonasymptotic behavior found in our different flows as has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "the difference might be due to ( i ) the different temperature regions of the experiment and/or ( ii ) the different concentrations .",
    "the initial values for the couplings in the flow equations depend on the value of the concentration , especially for small dilution one expects the coupling @xmath119 to be proportional to the concentration .",
    "if this is the case we expect a monotonous increase of the values of the effective exponent to the asymptotic value .",
    "a typical scenario is seen in curve 3 of figs .",
    "[ flows.eps ] , [ nu.eps ] , [ gamma.eps ] . in this case",
    "effective exponents equal to the pure model critical exponents might be found in relatively wide region of temperature . then as the attraction region of the fixed point p becomes weaker and weaker",
    ", an overshooting is possible and effective exponents larger its asymptotic values might be found .",
    "this scenario is predicted for larger dilutions and represented by the curve 6 of figs .",
    "[ flows.eps ] , [ nu.eps ] , [ gamma.eps ] .",
    "curves 5 , 6 correspond to situation when crossover from the mean field behavior towards the random one is not influenced by the presence of a pure fixed point .",
    "we studied the critical behavior of the three - dimensional weakly diluted ising model asymptotically close to the critical point , in the intermediate region and far from it .",
    "to this end we calculated the values of the asymptotical critical exponents , analyzed the behavior of the effective critical exponents and obtained the value of the correction - to - scaling exponent entering the wegner expression which describes the approach of singular quantities to the critical temperature .",
    "our study is based on the 5loop minimal subtraction field - theoretical renormalization group functions @xcite of the @xmath1theory with @xmath2symmetric and cubic interactions which in the replica limit @xmath0 correspond to the diluted ising model case .",
    "as the minimal subtraction scheme allows to develop either the @xmath3expansion or the 3d approach , we adopted the both schemes and compared the results obtained on their basis .    the perturbation theory rg functions series are asymptotic at best . in order to calculate the critical exponents we adopt different resummation procedures within the both schemes , testing them on the well established case of the @xmath1model with one coupling ( pure ising model ) .",
    "while after the resummation both @xmath36expansion and 3d approach give reliable results for the numerical values of the pure model critical exponents , in the case of the diluted ising model the bad convergence properties of the @xmath3expansion do not allow to obtain reliable values at @xmath4 . using the direct resummation of the rg functions at @xmath4 in the minimal subtraction scheme we obtained numerical values for the asymptotic critical exponents of the diluted ising model and estimated their accuracy to be of order of several percents .",
    "the results obtained in the 3d approach agree well with other theoretical and recent monte carlo simulations . studying the crossover effect we calculated the effective critical exponents and their flows in the nonasymptotic region .",
    "we observed several scenarios of crossover in the rim including : monotonous crossover from the mean field values of critical exponents to the random ones ; existence of a wide temperature region where the rim effective exponents coincide with the asymptotic exponents of the pure ising model ; possible values of effective exponents exceeding those of asymptotic ones .",
    "though the 3d approach of calculation encountered difficulties in the 5loop level we guess that the fixed @xmath6 approach , both within the massive @xcite and minimal subtraction @xcite schemes , remains the only reliable way to study critical behavior of the model by means of the rg technique .    _ note added in proof . _ during processing the article several new results appeared in the field . the massive scheme 4loop rg functions of the rim @xcite",
    "were extended to the five - loop @xcite and to the six - loop level @xcite .",
    "while the traditional analysis of the first via pb resummation allowed to obtain numerical values for the rim asymptotic critical exponents @xcite , the method failed for the higher - order functions @xcite . however , an application to the functions of a refined resummation procedure which treats renormalized couplings of the rg functions asymmetrically @xcite reconstituted and improved @xcite earliear data for the rim asymptotic critical exponents .",
    "*    we acknowledge helpful discussions with hagen kleinert and verena schulte - frohlinde .",
    "this work has been supported in part by `` sterreichische nationalbank jubilumsfonds '' through the grant no 7694 .",
    "in order to obtain reliable quantitative description of the problem under consideration one should adjust precisely resummation procedures necessary for analysis of rg functions .",
    "since no information is available about the high order behavior of the series for @xmath22 and @xmath28functions ( [ 11])-([14 ] ) ( compare with the @xmath141 and @xmath4 scalar @xmath1model where the borel summability of the rg functions is proven @xcite and the large order behavior is calculated @xcite ) , we reject all powerful methods implementing such an information ( e. g. resummation refined by a conformal mapping , widely used in the models of critical phenomena with one coupling @xcite ) and restrict ourselves to the simplest resummation techniques which are the generalisation of the pad  borel technique ( [ 18])([pade - borel ] ) to the two variable case . among them",
    "we choose that procedure , which , for the different orders of approximation , provides the maximal stability .",
    "that means , the fastest convergence of the results as well as the maximal similarity of the topological structure of the lines defined by the zeros of the @xmath22functions .",
    "let us start tuning the resummation technique by considering the expressions for a toy  model .",
    "it is defined by the partition function @xmath143 which corresponds to the cubic model described by the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) in dimension @xmath142 .",
    "one can easily calculate the sufficient number of terms representing @xmath144 in the form of a series in @xmath118 and @xmath119 for arbitrary @xmath145 .",
    "however , the simplest case which reproduces the series in two couplings is @xmath146 since the case @xmath89 is trivial and @xmath147 corresponds to a series in a single variable @xmath148 .",
    "we write the series for @xmath144 in the two variables @xmath118 and @xmath119 as a series in one auxiliary variable @xmath26 introduced by the substitution @xmath149 , @xmath150 ( the so called resolvent series @xcite ) and apply the pad ",
    "borel ( pb ) method ( [ 18])([pade - borel ] ) to the series in @xmath26 . here",
    "we choose two possibilities of the approximants , one with linear denominator and the other one of diagonal type .",
    "moreover we fix the parameter @xmath106 ( [ 18 ] ) to @xmath122 but discuss other choices for the parameter later on .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in figs .",
    "[ lin.eps][diag.eps ] for the specific values @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "one notes that a stable convergence to the exact value takes place only for resummations with diagonal approximants , while the approximants with linear denominator converge only for certain , `` optimally truncated '' , orders of approximation .",
    "the larger the value of the variables @xmath118 and @xmath119 the less is the order of `` optimal truncation '' .",
    "we believe that processing the divergent series ( [ 11])([14 ] ) in the same manner one may encounter a similar difficulty .",
    "analysing the toy  model series by the chisholm - borel ( cb ) scheme ( [ 20])([21 ] ) , one notes that the coefficients in the chisholm approximant are underdetermined .",
    "for example , for the @xmath104loop sum an approximant of the linear  denominator type @xmath153 $ ] beeing uniquely defined requires two additional equations .",
    "this is the minimal number of additional conditions , necessary , to determine any approximant for @xmath154 except for @xmath155 , where the @xmath156 $ ] approximant is determined uniquely without additional conditions .",
    "since , generally speaking , a near  diagonal chisholm approximant requires additional conditions the number of which depends on the order of approximation , we reject this type of approximants and consider in the following only the @xmath153 $ ] type approximants .",
    "the two additional equations have to be symmetric in the variables @xmath118 and @xmath119 , otherwise the properties of the symmetry related to these variables would depend on the method of calculation . by the substitution",
    "@xmath113 all the equations describing the critical behavior of the diluted model are converted into the appropriate equations of the pure model .",
    "however , if a pure model is solved independently , the resummation technique uses the pad approximant .",
    "thus , the chisholm approximant has to be chosen in such a way that , for either @xmath157 or @xmath113 one obtains the pad approximant of the one - variable case .",
    "this also needs a special choice of the additional conditions .",
    "this is achieved by choosing the chisholm approximant @xmath153 $ ] with the numerator coefficients at @xmath158 and @xmath159 equal to zero .",
    "let us turn back now to the expressions for the rg functions ( [ 11])-([14 ] ) at @xmath4 .",
    "starting from the pb analysis one finds that diagonal  type approximants lead to poles on the real axis .",
    "this may be due to the fact that such approximants do not reconstitute the sign - alternating high - order behavior of the general term of the rg functions , which was confirmed in the particular cases @xmath146 and @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "thus for the further discussions we proceed with approximants of linear  denominator type .    applying the pb method with linear  type approximants we find that the random fixed point for the @xmath4 rim can not be reconstituted already in the 3loop approximation , while the random fixed point exists even for nonresummed @xmath22functions in this approximation .",
    "the picture does not change qualitatively when we try to increase effectively the order of polynomial representation for the @xmath22functions by resumming expressions @xmath161\\beta_u , [ 1+r_v(u+v)]\\beta_v$ ] with @xmath162 taken as fit parameters ( compare with @xcite ) . the modified construction of ref .",
    "@xcite for the pad approximant with a linear denominator reconstituting the known large order behavior of the one coupling @xmath22functions , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , does not lead to the appearance of the random fixed point either .",
    "we conclude , although the pb scheme works in 2 and 4loop approximations , it appears to be unstable in the 3loop approximation and therefore we eliminate it from our consideration .",
    "the cb method reconstitutes the random fixed point in 2 , 3 and 4loop approximation , however it fails in the 5loop approximation . in order to reestablish the random fixed point",
    "we have varied the values of @xmath106 as well as of @xmath162 , but even then we find no region for @xmath165 so that the random fixed point exists in all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "we also predicted the values of the sixth order contribution for @xmath22functions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but the resummation of such pseudo6loop functions did not allow to find the random fixed point either . again",
    "a modified construction of the chisholm approximant with the known linear denominator @xcite failed . comparing the behavior of the toy  model series ( see fig . [ lin.eps ] ) and the convergence of the results of the rim ( tables [ tab8 ] ) we consider @xmath155 as the `` optimal truncation '' order within the cb scheme of linear  denominator approximant .",
    "once we have chosen the cb method based on chisholm approximants of @xmath166 $ ] type as the tool for analysing the rim rg functions we look now for the fastest convergence of the results with increase of the order of approximation in number of loops @xmath104 . to this end we fit the parameters @xmath106 entering borel - leroy images ( [ 20 ] ) of rg functions . for the rim",

    "the rg functions under consideration ( [ 11])([14 ] ) were obtained in order to study the critical behavior of the cubic model introduced by the effective hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) , we will use it for another test of the resummation procedure . in the case of nonzero values of @xmath145 the critical behavior of this system is governed either by the @xmath2symmetric fixed point for values of @xmath145 small enough or by the cubic fixed point for @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the marginal value of the order parameter component .",
