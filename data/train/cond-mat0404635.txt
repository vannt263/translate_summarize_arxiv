    "the successful growth of mn - based iii - v dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy @xcite has opened up new device possibilities to make simultaneous use of magnetic and semiconducting properties . although there exist different types of theoretical models to explain the microscopic mechanism of ferromagnetism in these semiconductors , @xcite a comprehensive picture has not been completed yet .",
    "only an accepted fact at the present is that the ferromagnetic interaction between mn ions is mediated by holes .",
    "there are two limiting cases for the possible interaction mechanisms : the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) type interaction @xcite and the double exchange ( de ) type interaction.@xcite however , neither of them is likely to provide a complete explanation .",
    "the rkky interaction is inconsistent with the fact that the estimated magnitude of the exchange interaction constant exceeds the fermi energy as well as the fact that ferromagnetism occurs even in the insulating phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the de mechanism has the problem that the valence states of most of the mn ions are found to be @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) ; there has been no strong evidence that the @xmath4-holes which contribute to the de interaction exist .",
    "therefore , the real interaction mechanism may be described by another model in which the character of the carrier is not pure @xmath0- or @xmath4-hole .",
    "the zener model , which is the limiting case of the rkky model for small carrier concentrations , is one of the possible mechanisms.@xcite in this case , if the @xmath4 state is deep enough in the valence band , holes at the fermi level have almost @xmath0-type character since the anti - bonding state formed by the @xmath0-@xmath4 hybridization is almost @xmath0-like and we can classify the system as a charge transfer insulator.@xcite however , there can be a case where the @xmath4-state is shallow and the holes have partly @xmath4-like character due to the strong @xmath0-@xmath4 hybridization .",
    "when the itinerant holes are @xmath4-like , the reality is closer to the de model.@xcite therefore , investigating the degree of localization of holes is very important in clarifying the physical picture of the carrier - induced ferromagnetism .",
    "since cyclotron resonance ( cr ) directly provides the effective masses and scattering times of carriers , we can obtain detailed information on the itinerancy of the carriers . in dc transport measurements it is normally difficult to deduce the contributions of the mass and scattering time independently .",
    "hence , cr on iii - v ferromagnetic semiconductors is one of the most intriguing and urgently required experiments .",
    "however , since the mobilities of iii - v ferromagnetic semiconductors are low ( @xmath7 100 @xmath8/vs ) , it is extremely difficult or impossible to observe cr in the magnetic field range of a conventional superconducting magnet ( @xmath7 20 t ) .",
    "recently , we reporetd results of an ultrahigh field ( @xmath9 100 t ) cr study of _ electrons _ in in@xmath1mn@xmath2as films.@xcite we described the dependence of cyclotron mass on @xmath3 , ranging from 0 to 12% .",
    "we observed that the electron cr peak shifts to lower field with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "midinfrared interband absorption spectroscopy revealed no significant @xmath3 dependence of the band gap .",
    "a detailed comparison of experimental results with calculations based on a modified pidgeon - brown model allowed us to estimate the @xmath10-@xmath4 and @xmath0-@xmath4 exchange constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 to be 0.5 ev and @xmath131.0 ev , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we report the first observation of _ hole _ cr in @xmath0-type in@xmath1mn@xmath2as films using even higher magnetic fields ( @xmath9 500 t ) .",
    "the observation of cr suggests that there are a large number of itinerant holes in inmnas and they behave like effective mass carriers rather than @xmath4-like holes or holes tightly bound to the acceptor atoms .",
    "this suggests that zener s @xmath0-@xmath4 exchange interaction @xcite is more favorable as the ferromagnetic interaction mechanism than the de interaction in inas - based magnetic semiconductors .",
    "the observation of cr is also consistent with the drude - like behavior observed in the optical conductivity of inmnas thin films reported recently.@xcite we also found that the observed cr mass is not very different from that of holes in inas .",
    "we deduced the cr mobilities of several samples with different mn concentrations from cr spectra at different photon energies and compared them with the values obtained by dc transport measurements .    finally , we performed detailed theoretical calculations within the effective mass formalism using a modified pidgeon and brown model.@xcite we found that theoretical cr absorption spectra obtained by the simulations reproduce very well the complicated cr spectra at very high fields .",
    "since the mobility of a ferromagnetic iii - v semiconductor is generally low ( less than 100 @xmath8/vs ) , using ultrahigh magnetic fields exceeding 100 t ( megagauss field ) is essential for the present study in order to satisfy the cr condition @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath16 is the scattering time.@xcite two kinds of pulsed magnets are used for field generation : the single turn coil technique @xcite and the electromagnetic flux compression method.@xcite the single - turn coil method can generate 200  t without any sample damage and thus we can repeat measurements on the same sample under the same experimental conditions . for higher field experiments we use the electromagnetic flux compression method that can generate fields",
    "up to 600  t. this is a totally destructive method and we lose the sample as well as the magnet in each shot .",
    "the maximum energy stored in capacitor banks is 200  kj for the single - turn coil method and 5  mj for the electromagnetic flux compression method .",
    "cr experiments were carried out by measuring the transmission of midinfrared radiation through the sample as a function of magnetic field .",
    "we use several types of infrared lasers as radiation sources .",
    "the wavelength range of the radiation was 28 @xmath17 m to 3.39 @xmath17 m , corresponding to a photon energy range of 44  mev to 366  mev .",
    "the use of the high magnetic fields required these unusually high photon energies for cr .",
    "in addition , the photon energy had to be higher than the plasma frequency ; the samples were heavily doped and the plasma frequency was estimated to be @xmath1830 mev and @xmath1860 mev for the light holes and heavy holes using effective masses of 0.026@xmath19 and 0.35@xmath19 , respectively , and a concentration of 1 @xmath20 10@xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "we measured six @xmath0-inmnas samples with various mn concentrations ( @xmath3 = 0 , 0.003 , 0.0045 , 0.006 , 0.02 , and 0.025 ) .",

    "typical room - temperature magneto - transmission spectra at 5.53 @xmath17 m ( @xmath26 = 0.224 ev ) and 10.6 @xmath17 m ( @xmath26 = 0.117 ev ) for different mn concentrations are shown in fig .",

    "quarter - wave plates were used to create a hole - active circularly polarized beam . for all samples ,",
    "a broad absorption peak was observed at 80 - 100 t for 5.53 @xmath17 m and at @xmath18 40 t for 10.6 @xmath17 m . based on our detailed theoretical analysis ( to be discussed later ) , we attribute this peak to heavy hole ( hh ) cr .",
    "we observe another absorption band at @xmath18 150 t with 10.6 @xmath17 m radiation , and attribute it to light hole ( lh ) cr .",
    "the cyclotron masses and cyclotron mobilites of hh were deduced from the peak positions and widths , respectively , and plotted in fig .  [ summary ] .",
    "only the transition between landau levels with small indices ( quantum numbers ) contributes to the cr even at room temperature due to the large cyclotron energy at high fields in the megagauss range .",
    "thus , the obtained masses are significantly smaller than the band edge hh mass ( 0.35@xmath19 ) due to the well known quantum effect in high magnetic fields .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ summary](a ) , the hh cyclotron mass tends to decrease with @xmath3 up to @xmath3 = 0.02 when measured at 5.53 @xmath17 m .",
    "however , the hh mass for the @xmath3 = 0.025 sample apparently deviates from this tendency .",
    "in addition , the hh mass obtained at 10.6 @xmath17 m does not show any obvious dependence on the mn concentration .",
    "it may suggest that some other effects such as strain and disorder are playing a role in determining the masses .",
    "actually , as shown later , our detailed landau level calculation at the high fields suggests that the hh band edge mass in in@xmath1mn@xmath2as is nearly the same with the hh band edge mass in inas .",
    "the cyclotron mobilities in fig .",
    "[ summary](b ) are larger than those obtained by dc transport measurements even in the nonmagnetic ( @xmath3 = 0 ) sample .",
    "this is partly because the hh cyclotron masses in this high field range are an order of magnitude smaller than the classical value , as we pointed out above .",
    "another possible origin of the discrepancy is the reduction of magnetic scattering at high fields , i.e. , the randomness of mn spins decreases at strong magnetic fields even at room temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the relative increase of the mobility compared to the dc value is larger for the magnetic samples than the nonmagnetic sample ( inas ) .",
    "however , the fact that cyclotron mobilities measured at 10.6 @xmath17 m ( resonance fields @xmath1840 t ) are larger than those measured at 5.53 @xmath17 m ( resonance field @xmath18 80 - 100 t ) is not explainable by this picture . since at room temperature the magnetization is not saturated even at 100 t , the randomness of mn spins should be smaller for higher fields.@xcite although we take into account the mass increase due to the band non - parabolicity , the scattering time ( @xmath16 ) deduced from the cyclotron mass ( @xmath27 ) and the cyclotron mobility ( @xmath28 ) is found to be smaller at 5.53 @xmath17 m than that at 10.6 @xmath17 m .",
    "moreover , the cyclotron mobility is not dependent on the temperature as we show later .",
    "hence , it is expected that magnetic effects on scattering processes are suppressed at lower fields than the field range where we observed cr .",

    "[ temp1](a ) and [ temp1](b ) , respectively .",
    "the hh cr peak position is found to be rather insensitive to the temperature in both samples , suggesting that any effect of tempereture - dependent exchange splitting of the landau levels is small .",
    "this is because the mn concentration is small and the relative energy of the exchange splitting to the cyclotron energy is small in the megagauss range .",
    "also , we find that the cyclotron mobility shows no significant change for both samples . this should be contrasted to the cyclotron mobility of inas , which increases with decreasing temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ temp2 ] .",
    "it is likely that impurity scattering is more significant in inmnas than inas and the effect of suppression of magnetic scattering at low temperature which is expected for inmnas , is not large enough to be observed .",
    "it should be noted that a new broad absorption band appears at low temperature and low fields below 20 t for both samples , labeled ` @xmath11 ' in fig .",
    "[ temp1 ] .",
    "one of the possible origins of this band is impurity shifted cr ( icr ) absorption .",
    "if this is the case , it could be closely related to the mn impurity band and useful for clarifying the picture of ferromagnetism .",
    "however , our cr experiments at higher photon energies ( see , e.g. , the trace for 3.39 @xmath17 m and 14 k in fig .  [ megacr ] ) and theoretical calculations indicate that this is not the case .    as we decribed previously,@xcite the width of the low field tail results from higher order landau levels being populated and thus it depends on the free hole concentration .",
    "in addition , the sharpness of the low field cutoff is seen to depend on temperature and can be attributed to the sharpness of the fermi distribution at low temperatures .",
    "the results show that the cyclotron resonance for the inmnas case is made up of one strong heavy hole transition together with background absorption due to higher populated landau levels at low values of the magnetic field .",
    "hence , it is suggested that the electronic structure in in@xmath1mn@xmath2as is not strongly modified from that in inas .",
