    "compressed sensing  @xcite is a fundamental idea in mathematics , which utilizes the _ a priori _ property of signal @xmath3 of length @xmath4 being @xmath5 sparse in some domain , where @xmath6 , along with an appropriately constructed sensing matrix @xmath7 , to establish a unique solution for an otherwise undetermined system of linear equations : @xmath8 the actual solution , is the vector from the solution set , which has the minimum @xmath9 norm . since this is a np - hard problem , so we choose the solution which minimizes the @xmath10 norm . it is observed that minimizing @xmath10 norm will give an accurate solution  @xcite provided the sensing matrix @xmath7 satisfies the restricted isometry property ( @xmath11 ) property  @xcite .",
    "however , if the sparsity of the input signal is not precisely known , but known to lie within a specified range , traditional compressed sensing as such can not exploit this fact and would need to use the same number of measurements for all sparsity values in this range . in this case , the compressed sensing algorithm has to work taking into account the worst case , which corresponds to the signal being least sparse .",
    "for example if the input signal is a discrete - time digital signal of length @xmath4 and can have sparsity anywhere between @xmath12 to @xmath13 in the frequency domain , for compressed sensing to work , one has to design the sensing matrix keeping in mind the sparsity value @xmath14 .",
    "for this case , there are @xmath15 frequencies in the signal which will correspond to @xmath16 complex coefficients ( depending upon the locations of those 25 frequency coefficients ) , it was experimentally observed to take about @xmath1 ( @xmath17 ) measurements for an accurate reconstruction by minimizing the @xmath10 norm . thus if the input signal had sparsity @xmath18 , conventional compressed sensing would take @xmath1 measurements ( since it has been designed for sparsity @xmath14 ) whereas only 40 measurements would have sufficed .",
    "thus , we have unnecessarily used 135 more measurements than needed in this case .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel method called compressed shattering to address this particular issue .",
    "the central idea of compressed shattering is to adapt compressed sensing to the specified sparsity range by creating shattered signals  @xcite which have fixed sparsity using a filter - bank .",
    "our primary aim is to reduce the number of measurements .",
    "the problem is stated as follows . the input signal is a discrete - time digital signal of length",
    "@xmath4 which needs to be sensed .",
    "it is sparse within a range @xmath19 $ ] in the frequency domain , where @xmath20 . here ,",
    "@xmath5-sparse means there are only @xmath5 non - zero coefficients in the @xmath21 of the input signal , without considering the symmetric complex conjugate parts .",
    "the proposed algorithm is described in fig .  [ forward_compresss_filtering ] .",
    "first the input signal is permuted .",
    "this results in a permutation of the spectrum ( @xmath21 ) in order to remove any clusters and to spread it out .",
    "the permuted spectrum is then passed through a filter - bank , which is a set of @xmath22 band - pass filters , where @xmath23 .",
    "an inverse permutation operation is done on all the filter outputs to put the spectrum back in its original position .",
    "the compressed sensing algorithm is applied on the output of the filters ; using the same sensing matrix on each of them . depending upon the sparsity level of the original signal",
    ", the filter outputs might be zero or a very sparse signal , and the level of sparsity in the output of each of the filters can be controlled by adjusting the characteristics and number of filters . in the succeeding subsections , we describe each block in detail .",
    "the permutation block performs a mapping operation in which the indices of input signal are rearranged .",
    "it is given by : @xmath24    where @xmath3 is the input discrete - time signal of length @xmath4 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is to be noted that all the operations performed on the indices are modulo @xmath4 operations .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 should be relatively prime to @xmath4 to ensure that the resultant permutation matrix is invertible .",
    "considering @xmath4 to be power of @xmath27 , any odd number belong to set @xmath28 would suffice . permutation done using @xmath26 will ensure that the spectrum of the signal also gets permuted but with @xmath29 as the permutation parameter  @xcite , in accordance with the equation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath4-@xmath21 of @xmath3 and @xmath32 and @xmath29 is defined as @xmath33 .",
    "[ permutation_unclustering ] depicts the permutation on an example , it can also be seen that this permutation helps to de - cluster the signal spectrum .",
    "the permuted signal is then passed through a filter - bank of @xmath22 non - overlapping ideal filters .",
    "it should be noted that the filter design and the algorithm that follows in this paper is done by considering @xmath4 to be even and the number of filters @xmath22 divides @xmath34 to give an integer .",

    "when @xmath42 , we have :    @xmath43    out of the @xmath22 filters , only @xmath44 of them will have significant outputs , where @xmath45 .",
    "this filter bank will do a circular convolution as opposed to the normal linear convolution .",
    "it is done to preserve the length of the signal and it will be a perfect element wise multiplication in the fourier domain without having to pad any zeros .",
    "preservation of length is necessary for the inverse permutation block that comes next .",
    "the signal is then passed through it for reversing the permutation operation , thereby putting the spectrum back in its original position .",
    "[ filter_performance_mega ] gives an example of filtering and inverse permutation operations .",
    "the output signals obtained at the end of filtering and inverse permutation are known as _ shattered _",
    "signals  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , the shattered signals are relatively more sparse than the input signal and the sparsity can be controlled by suitably changing @xmath26 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is also possible to obtain shattered signals which are at most 1-sparse as the outputs .",
    "the shattered signals are now ready for compressed sensing . each of the output signals are sensed by the same sensing matrix @xmath7 , designed for specific level of sparsity , which will preferably be much less than the original minimum sparsity @xmath47 of the signal specified in the range . note that more the number of frequencies present in the signal , the less sparse is its spectrum .",
    "although it is possible to obtain different level of sparsity for the shattered signal , in this paper , we have ensured that the shattered signals are all 0 or 1-sparse .",
    "in other words , the filter outputs have at most a single frequency .",
    "hence the number of filters @xmath22 should be at least @xmath47 .",
    "this is sensed by a @xmath48 sensing matrix @xmath7 specifically designed to sense such 1-sparse data , taking into account the symmetry of the @xmath21 . by this",
    ", we ensure that each of the non - zero shattered signals can be sensed in just @xmath27 measurements . in total that will amount to at most @xmath49 measurements .      as opposed to use of a sensing matrix with random values , we propose a simple but efficient deterministic sensing matrix @xmath7 .",
    "we make use of the information that shattered signals are either 0 or 1-sparse .",
    "the number of unknowns are just two for each output ( position and value of complex @xmath21 coefficient ) .",
    "we also make use of the fact that the @xmath21 , for real signals , is conjugate symmetric .    @xmath50    @xmath51",

    "this sensing matrix will ensure that the sensing happens only for the first half of the spectrum .",
    "further , at most only @xmath44 of the filters will have significant output , namely @xmath63 .",
    "so , only the measurements , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , corresponding to those @xmath44 filters needs to be stored . for this reason",

    "to summarize , compressed shattering has four steps in the following order .",
    "the input signal is 1 ) permuted , 2 ) passed through a filter - bank , 3 ) de - permuted , and 4 ) finally sensed by a sensing matrix @xmath7 .",
    "there will be @xmath22 such paths corresponding to @xmath22 filters , however only @xmath44 will be significant ( refer to fig .  [ forward_compresss_filtering ] ) . since every block is a linear transformation ( up to the thresholding block ) , we can reduce the entire compressed shattering procedure to one single matrix ( for each of the @xmath22 paths ) .",

    "in this section , we perform numerical simulations to test our proposed algorithm and compare it with conventional compressed sensing .",
    "the parameters for comparison will be number of measurements stored and number of computations .",
    "the input signal to the system is a discrete - time real signal of length @xmath96 and will have sparsity anywhere in the range @xmath12 to @xmath14 frequencies .",

    "table  [ tab : tableresults ] shows the comparison between compressed sensing and compressed shattering in terms of number of measurements to be stored and number of additions and multiplications .",
    "although @xmath99 filters are used in the compressed shattering algorithm ( @xmath26=11 ) , very few shattered signals have significant energy indicating that most of them are 0-sparse . by choosing a threshold of 0.01 for the @xmath100 ,",
    "only very few shattered signals are retained as 1-sparse output signals .",
    "the measurements for compressed shattering are complex values whereas as compressed sensing yields real measurement values . however , in the table we have indicated number of real measurements which implies that we have multiplied the number of measurements for compressed shattering by 2 . in all cases , we obtained near - perfect reconstruction since the maximum absolute reconstruction error was @xmath101 .    from the table , we can infer that there is a tradeoff between the number of measurements that have to be stored and the computational complexity involved in taking the initial measurement .",
    "only half the number of real values have to be stored in the case of compressed shattering compared to the conventional compressed sensing method , but the computational complexity of the former is a little more than twice that of the latter in terms of both number of addition and multiplication .",
    "this is the price we pay for the reduction in number of measurements .",
    "it also should be noted that the algorithm , as of now , is heavily dependent on the @xmath26 we choose .",

    "we have proposed compressed shattering - a novel way of extending compressed sensing when the sparsity of the input signal is within a specified range .",
    "the idea of using a linear congruential generator on the discrete - time indices helps to randomize the frequency components , and thus in de - clustering the spectrum .",
    "this is then exploited by creating 1-sparse signals by means of a filter - bank .",
    "reconstruction is very fast owing to a simple deterministic sensing matrix that we have proposed for 1-sparse signals .",
