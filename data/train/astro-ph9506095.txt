    "the issue of the total number of galaxies in the visible universe is more than an academic curiosity ; number counts as a function of apparent magnitude hold important clues to the formation and evolution of galaxies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the study of very faint field galaxies using ccds was pioneered by tyson ( 1988 ) who found an integrated number density of @xmath11 degree@xmath4 , or @xmath12 galaxies over the whole sky at @xmath13 .",
    "two more recent studies which are notable for their depth and resolution are those of the hawaii group ( @xcite ) and the durham group ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the latter now reach galaxy surface densities in excess of @xmath14 degree@xmath4 for a small field at a limiting magnitude of @xmath15 .",
    "equivalent surface densities are also being achieved in the near - infrared , @xmath16 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "potentially the most interesting result from these studies , first observed by lilly et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and confirmed by metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) with deeper data , is the change in the slope , @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) , of the deep @xmath19 counts .",
    "the differential galaxy number counts in the @xmath19-band show a decrease in slope from @xmath20 to @xmath21 at @xmath22 ( equivalent to @xmath2324.5 ) .",
    "in addition , roche et al .",
    "( 1993 ) claim that the amplitude of the two - point angular correlation function reaches a minimum around @xmath22 . taken together these two observations",
    "have been interpreted by metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) as a signature of an increasing dominance of low luminosity galaxies at @xmath24 .",
    "these features , if confirmed and observed in other passbands , will constrain galaxy evolution models , although redshift information will be required before any strong conclusions can be drawn .",
    "this letter presents the first deep optical counts with the 10-m keck telescope .",
    "these @xmath0 observations are both deeper , at a given completeness limit , than previous published observations and more significantly were obtained in good seeing , fwhm @xmath25@xmath26 arcsec , providing a wealth of information on the very faint field population .",
    "the observations presented here were obtained by s.r .  kulkarni and j.g .",
    "cohen to study the optical emission from two high galactic latitude pulsars .",
    "thus for our purposes the fields provide randomly selected samples of the faint field population .",
    "these data were obtained on the night of 1994 august 8 using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris , @xcite ) on the 10-m keck telescope , mauna kea .",
    "the imaging mode of lris provides a @xmath27 arcmin field onto a thinned tek detector with 0.21 arcsec / pixel sampling and 8.0@xmath28 readnoise .",
    "conditions during this run were good and the night was photometric ; a log of the observations is given in table  1 .",
    "the raw frames , with individual exposure times between 0.51.5ks , were debiased and then flatfielded in a standard manner using dome flatfields . for each passband the dithered frames , with pointing offsets of 1020 arcsec , were registered and combined using standard iraf routines and a clipped - average algorithm to produce the final images .",
    "we reproduce a randomly chosen @xmath29 arcmin region from the @xmath30 frame of 1640 + 22 in figure  1 .",
    "photometric calibrations were derived from observations of landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars at air masses very close to those of our science observations .",
    "we estimate the average errors in our absolute calibrations to be @xmath31 .",
    "color differences between the standard stars and typical faint galaxies give systematic errors of a similar size .",
    "the estimated reddening is @xmath32 ( @xcite ) for both fields and so we have applied zero point corrections of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we conservatively estimate our absolute magnitude calibrations to be good to @xmath36 mag .      to analyse these images we elected to use the sextractor image analysis package ( @xcite ) .",
    "this package is a fast , image analysis program which can detect ( using a standard isophotal limit and area cut algorithm ) , robustly deblend and analyse sparse and moderately crowded galaxy fields .",
    "the program provides positions , shapes , image profiles , half - light radii , isophotal and aperture magnitudes for all deblended objects detected on a frame . to detect objects",
    "we first smooth the frame with the point spread function , then thresholded it at a level of @xmath37 of the sky noise in the raw frame and identify objects .",
    "this threshold provides a typical point source detection limit of @xmath38 and appeared optimal in our incompleteness and noise object analyses .    to obtain total magnitudes for our galaxies",
    "we have followed the approach used by djorgovski et al .",
    "for the fainter objects we use a fixed aperture ( 1.5 arcsec diameter or @xmath39@xmath40fwhm ) to measure magnitudes , these are then aperture corrected to a 5.6 arcsec diameter under the assumption that the objects have roughly stellar profiles , a correction of @xmath41 at @xmath42 .",
    "this assumption was tested by stacking many faint objects to make `` average '' faint galaxies with high enough signal - to - noise for large aperture photometry ; we find that the average galaxies have aperture corrections close to those of the stars ( as expected from their typical sizes , see below ) .",
    "for the brighter objects in the field , those with isophotal diameters larger than our adopted fixed aperture , we measure isophotal magnitudes above a surface brightness threshold of 0.9@xmath43 of the sky noise ( table  1 ) and similarly correct to 5.6 arcsec diameter .",
    "the majority of the objects with magnitudes brighter than @xmath44 are saturated in our frames ; we do not present counts brighter than this limit . to measure colors for our objects",
    "we smooth all the frames to the effective seeing of the worst frame ( the @xmath8 data ) , before measuring photometry in 1.5 arcsec diameter apertures for all the objects selected from the @xmath30 catalogs .",
    "removal of stars from our object catalog is necessary at brighter magnitudes . with the good seeing experienced during these observations",
    "it is relatively straightforward to use image concentration to identify the stellar locus to a depth of @xmath45 .",
    "comparison of the colors of these candidate stars to those in landolt ( 1992 ) confirms their identification and supports our estimates of the errors on our absolute color calibrations of @xmath36 mag . at @xmath45",
    "the stellar fraction is @xmath46 and falling , so we do not apply any correction for stellar contamination fainter than @xmath47 .",
    "non - detection , failure to detect an object that is really there ; false detection , detection of non - real , noise objects ; and magnitude errors , incorrect measurement of an object s flux , all plague faint galaxy counts .",
    "these problems become progressively worse at fainter magnitudes , with their relative importance depending upon the slope of the counts ( because magnitude errors `` scatter '' plentiful faint objects into brighter magnitude bins ; eddington bias ) and the details of the data reduction procedures .",
    "we assess non - detection and magnitude errors simultaneously with a monte carlo simulation that involves adding artificial galaxies to the data and re - applying the detection algorithm . in order to simulate both the mean properties and morphological diversity of faint galaxies we create artificial objects by extracting galaxy images at magnitude levels for which errors are negligible and dimming them by 2.5 magnitudes , at a constant angular size .",
    "it should be noted that if the scale sizes of galaxies decrease at fainter magnitudes ( c.f .  ",
    "3 ) then this procedure will tend to overestimate our incompleteness .",
    "extensive simulations ( @xmath48 objects per frame , dropped in one at a time ) were used to create a large matrix @xmath49 each element of which is the probability that a galaxy with magnitude @xmath50 is detected with a measured magnitude @xmath51 .",
    "this matrix contains all of the completeness and magnitude error information . on the assumption that the counts do not turn over quickly ( i.e.  @xmath17 does not change rapidly with magnitude near the limit of the data )",
    ", @xmath49 can be projected into a total detection rate @xmath52 , the ratio of number observed to true number at magnitude @xmath51 .",
    "the true number of galaxies in bin @xmath53 can then be estimated by dividing the observed number @xmath54 by the detection rate @xmath52 .    to correct for false detections",
    "we have created noise frames identical to our observations , geometrically remapped , combined and analysed them in the same manner as the observations .",
    "we subtract the number counts of noise objects found in these simulated frames from our observed counts .",
    "this correction is a few percent or less , even in our faintest magnitude bins .",
    "the faintest magnitude at which the counts can be reasonably completeness - corrected is subjective ; we truncate our counts at or before the @xmath55 completeness level , beyond which the poisson errors , or any other error estimates , lose their meaning .",
    "we plot in figure  2 the raw and corrected differential galaxy number counts from our two fields .",
    "we measure slopes from the combined field counts of : @xmath56 for @xmath57@xmath58 , flattening to @xmath59 at fainter magnitudes , @xmath60 for @xmath61@xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64@xmath65 .",
    "we see no obvious variation in the @xmath30 and @xmath66 slopes .",
    "the evidence for the break in @xmath8 count slope at @xmath67 is certainly not pronounced , but it is stronger in the deeper , wider - area 1640 + 22 data , and as we show below it is also seen in the median galaxy colors .",
    "the integrated , corrected number counts are @xmath68 per sq .",
    "degree to @xmath69 , @xmath70 to @xmath71 , and @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "we also plot on figure  2 counts by other workers .",
    "the discrepencies in the count slopes at bright magnitudes may arise from other groups choosing fields devoid of bright galaxies , this biases them towards underdense regions producing a systematic undercount of galaxies at bright and intermediate magnitudes and thus a steeper slope to the counts . at faint limits we find reasonable agreement between the slopes of the various datasets , with residual differences in normalisation consistent with the different photometric corrections applied by different workers and our quoted photometric errors .",
    "the color distributions for our faint galaxy sample are shown in figure  3 .",
    "all show a bluing trend with fainter magnitude until @xmath2324.5 , where a typical galaxy has a flat spectral energy distribution in @xmath74 ( corresponding to @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "fainter than @xmath2324.5 the typical  colors turn - around and become redder , while the  colors flatten out and the  continue to become bluer ( c.f .",
    "if we are observing the same population in all three bands , then these trends in median color should be reflected in different count slopes in @xmath0 . at @xmath77",
    "the bluing trends indicate @xmath78 as observed . after the turn - around ,",
    "the colors imply a decrease in @xmath79 from steeper than @xmath66 at the bright end , to matching the @xmath66 slope at the faint end .",
    "this change in @xmath8-band slope is indeed seen in the counts , although its significance is not high .    the good seeing of our observations allow us to study the angular sizes of the faint galaxy population .",
    "we plot in figure  4 the observed half - light radii , @xmath80 , measured from the @xmath30-band images . a gradual , near linear , decline is seen in the median size of faint galaxies to @xmath1026 , at which point the median size is only just distinguishable from the stellar locus .",
    "representing the faint field population as exponential disks leads to an estimate of the intrinsic half - light radius of a typical @xmath8126 galaxy of @xmath82 arcsec .",
    "this angular size corresponds to less than @xmath83 at _ any _ redshift in _ any _ world model , so it is clear that the typical objects we are detecting are either intrinsically smaller or produce a larger fraction of their emission in their nuclear regions than local bright galaxies .",
    "splitting the sample in two in each magnitude bin on the basis of  color shows no statistical difference between the sizes of the blue and red galaxies .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented deep galaxy counts in @xmath0 passbands .",
    "we find a decrease in slope in our bluest passband , @xmath8 , at the faint end similar to that seen in the @xmath19-band by metcalfe et al.(1995 ) at an equivalent apparent magnitude .",
    "beyond @xmath23 it appears that galaxy counts approach @xmath84 in all bands , shallow enough to remove the threat of a divergence in the integrated night sky brightness .",
    "if we are not seeing to very high redshift , either because the universe is einstein - de sitter and we are running out of volume , or because there are few luminous , high redshift field galaxies , then the common faint - end slope in the galaxy counts is a measure of the shape of the galaxy ( or possibly pre - galactic fragment , in view of the small angular size of the faintest objects ) luminosity function at the faint end . in these scenarios , the slope of @xmath85 implies a faint end luminosity function @xmath86 at large look - back times , in contrast to @xmath87 observed locally ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the faint counts may thus confirm , at higher redshift , the steepening of the faint - end slope of the luminosity function suggested by analyses of spectroscopic samples at brighter magnitudes ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the roll - over at @xmath67 is within reach of the new generation of large telescopes and therefore we may hope for direct spectroscopic observations of galaxies in this intriguing magnitude range .",
    "firstly , we thank shri kulkarni for his great generosity in allowing us to use these data . we acknowledge useful discussions and encouragement from rebecca bernstein , roger blandford and nigel metcalfe .",
    "we also thank the referee , richard kron , for many helpful comments .",
