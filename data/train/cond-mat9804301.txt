    "the large variety of novel and interesting phenomena of thin - film magnetism results very much from the fact that the magnetic anisotropy , which determines the easy axis of magnetization , can be one or two orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding bulk systems@xcite .",
    "the reorientation transition ( rt ) of the direction of magnetization in thin ferromagnetic films describes the change of the easy axis by variation of the film thickness or temperature and has been widely studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "an instructive phenomenological picture for the understanding of the rt is obtained by expanding the free energy @xmath0 of the system in powers of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the angle between the direction of magnetization and the surface normal .",
    "neglecting azimuthal anisotropy and exploiting time inversion symmetry yields : @xmath3 the anisotropy coefficients of second ( @xmath4 ) and fourth ( @xmath5 ) order depend on the thickness @xmath6 of the film as well as on the temperature @xmath7 .",
    "away from the transition point usually @xmath8 holds , and , therefore , the direction of magnetization is determined by the sign of @xmath4 ( @xmath9 : out - of - plane magnetization ; @xmath10 : in - plane magnetization ) . on this basis",
    "the concept of anisotropy flow @xcite immediately tells us that the rt is caused by a sign change of @xmath4 while the sign of @xmath5 mainly determines whether the transition is continuous ( @xmath11 ) or step - like ( @xmath12 ) . in the case of a continuous transition @xmath5 also gives the width of the transition region .    from the microscopic point of view",
    "we know that the magnetic anisotropy is exclusively caused by two effects , the dipole interaction between the magnetic moments in the sample and the spin - orbit coupling : @xmath13 .",
    "while the dipole interaction always favors in - plane magnetization ( @xmath14 ) due to minimization of stray fields , the spin - orbit interaction can lead to both , in - plane and out - of - plane magnetization depending sensitively on the electronic structure of the underlying sample .",
    "the spin - orbit anisotropy is caused by the broken symmetry@xcite at the film surface and the substrate - film interface as well as by possible strain@xcite in the volume of the film .",
    "it is worth to stress that a strong positive spin - orbit induced anisotropy alone opens up the possibility of an out - of - plane magnetized thin film .",
    "the rt must be seen as a competition between spin - orbit and dipole anisotropy .    in many thin - film systems",
    "both thickness- and temperature - driven rts are observed .",
    "although it is clear by inspection of the corresponding phase diagrams @xcite that both types of transitions are closely related to each other , different theoretical concepts are needed to explain their physical origin .",
    "the thickness - driven rt is rather well understood in terms of a phenomenological separation of the spin - orbit induced anisotropy constant @xmath15 into a surface term @xmath16 and a volume contribution @xmath17 by the ansatz @xmath18 .",
    "experimentally , this separation seems to provide a rather consistent picture@xcite despite the fact that in some samples additional structural transitions are present@xcite which clearly restrict its validity . on the theoretical side ,",
    "basically two different schemes for the calculation of @xmath19 magnetic anisotropy constants have been developed , semi - empirical tight - binding theories@xcite and spin - polarized ab initio total - energy calculations @xcite . in both approaches the spin - orbit coupling is introduced either self - consistently or as a final perturbation . however , these investigations still remain to be a delicate problem because of the very small energy differences involved .    neglecting the large variety of different samples , substrates , growth conditions , etc .",
    "it is useful for the understanding of the rt to concentrate on two somewhat idealized prototype systems both showing a thickness- as well as a temperature - driven rt .",
    "the `` fe - type '' systems @xcite are characterized by a large positive surface anisotropy constant @xmath20 together with a negative volume anisotropy @xmath21 due to dipole interaction .",
    "this leads to out - of - plane magnetization for very thin films . for increasing film thickness the magnetization switches to an in - plane direction because the volume contribution becomes dominating@xcite . as a function of increasing temperature a rt from out - of - plane to in - plane",
    "magnetization is found for certain thicknesses @xcite .    in the `` ni - type '' systems @xcite",
    ", the situation is different . here",
    "the volume contribution @xmath21 is positive due to fct lattice distortion @xcite , thereby favoring out - of - plane magnetization , while the surface term @xmath20 is negative .",
    "for very thin films the surface contribution dominates leading to in - plane magnetization . at a critical thickness",
    ", however , the positive volume anisotropy forces the system to be magnetized in out - of - plane direction @xcite , until at a second critical thickness the magnetization switches to an in - plane position again caused by structural relaxation effects . here a so - called anomalous temperature - driven rt from in - plane to out - of - plane magnetization was found recently by farle et  al.@xcite .    in this article",
    "we will focus on the temperature - driven rt which can not be understood by means of the separation into surface and volume contribution alone . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 need to be determined for each temperature separately .",
    "experimentally , this has been done in great detail for the second - order anisotropy of ni / cu(100)@xcite .",
    "the results clearly confirm the existence and position of the rt , but , on the other hand , do not lead to any microscopic understanding of its origin .    to obtain more information on the temperature - driven rt theoretical investigations on simplified model systems",
    "have proven to be fruitful . despite the fact that in the underlying transition - metal samples the spontaneous magnetization is caused by the itinerant , strongly correlated 3d - electrons , up to now heisenberg - type models",
    "have been considered exclusively @xcite .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy has been taken into account by incorporating the dipole interaction and an uniaxial single - ion anisotropy to model the spin - orbit - induced anisotropy . using appropriate @xmath19 second - order anisotropy constants as input parameters , both types of rts",
    "have been observed within the framework of a self - consistent mean field approximation @xcite as well as by first - order perturbation theory for the free energy @xcite .",
    "a continuous rt has been found for @xmath24 layers@xcite taking place over a rather small temperature range .",
    "step - like transitions occur as an exception for special parameter constellations only .",
    "the rt is attributed to the strong reduction of the surface - layer magnetization relative to the inner layers for increasing temperature leading to a diminishing influence of the surface anisotropy .    since the itinerant nature of the magnetic moments",
    "is ignored completely in these calculations , it is interesting to compare these results with calculations done within itinerant - electron systems .",
    "the present work employs a similar concept but in the framework of the single - band hubbard model@xcite which we believe is a more reasonable starting point for the description of temperature - dependent electronic structure of thin transition - metal films .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in the next section we define our model hamilton operator . in sec .",

    "the description of the film geometry requires some care .",
    "each lattice vector of the film is decomposed into two parts @xmath25 @xmath26 denotes a lattice vector of the underlying two - dimensional bravais lattice with @xmath27 sites . to each lattice point a @xmath6-atom basis @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is associated referring to the @xmath6 layers of the film .",
    "the same labeling , of course , also applies for all other quantities related to the film geometry . within each layer",

    "@xmath51 are the spin operators constructed by the pauli spin matrices @xmath52 .",
    "the expectation value of the spin operator yields the ( dimensionless ) magnetization vector @xmath53 the magnetization only depends on the layer index @xmath54 because of the assumed translational invariance within the layers .    in our approach the uniaxial anisotropy caused by the spin - orbit coupling",
    "is taken into account phenomenologically by an effective layer - dependent anisotropy field coupled to the spin operator : @xmath55 the effective field @xmath56 is chosen to be parallel to the film normal @xmath57 . to ensure the right symmetry we set :",
    "@xmath58 this corresponds to a mean - field treatment of the spin - orbit - induced anisotropy@xcite .",
    "the strengths of the anisotropy fields @xmath59 enter as additional parameters and have to be fixed later .",
    "the direction of the magnetization is determined by the minimal free energy @xmath0 .",
    "the anisotropic contributions @xmath60 and @xmath43 to the hamilton operator ( [ ham_op ] ) can be considered as a small perturbation to the isotropic hubbard model ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "then we can apply a thermodynamic perturbation expansion@xcite of the free energy @xmath0 up to linear order with respect to @xmath62 : @xmath63 here @xmath64 denotes the expectation value taken within the unperturbated hubbard model @xmath31 . on the same footing we use a mean - field decoupling for the two - particle expectation values contained in @xmath65 . because @xmath0 is calculated to linear order in the anisotropy contributions , only the lowest , i.e. second - order anisotropy constants are considered , and a possible canted phase is neglected .",
    "the ratio @xmath66 and thus the width of the transition region have been found to be very small for reasonable strengths of the anisotropy contributions @xcite .    within our approach",
    "it is , therefore , sufficient to consider the free - energy difference @xmath67 between in - plane and out - of - plane magnetization : @xmath68 @xmath10 and @xmath9 indicate in - plane and out - of - plane magnetization respectively .",

    "in this section we will focus on the evaluation of the hubbard film @xmath31 .",
    "ferromagnetism in the hubbard model is surely a strong - coupling phenomenon .",
    "the existence of ferromagnetic solutions was recently proven in the limit of infinite dimensions by quantum monte - carlo calculations@xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism is favored by a strongly asymmetric bloch density of states ( bdos ) and by a singularity at the upper band edge as it is found , e. g. , for the fcc lattice .",
    "the hubbard model constitutes a highly non - trivial many - body problem even for a periodic infinitely extended lattice .",
    "even more complications are introduced when the reduction of translational symmetry has to be taken into account additionally .",
    "one of the easiest possible approximations to treat a hubbard film is a hartree - fock decoupling , which has been applied previously @xcite .",
    "hartree - fock theory , however , is necessarily restricted to the weak - coupling regime and is known to overestimate the possibility of ferromagnetic order drastically . neglecting electron - correlation effects altogether leads to qualitatively wrong results especially for intermediate and strong coulomb interaction @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we did not find a realistic temperature - driven rt within this approach .",
    "thus we require an approximation scheme which is clearly beyond the hartree - fock solution and takes into account electron correlations more reasonably . on the other hand",
    ", it must be simple enough to allow for an extended study of magnetic phase transitions in thin films .",
    "for this purpose we apply the spectral - density approach ( sda)@xcite which is motivated by the rigorous analysis of harris and lange@xcite in the limit of strong coulomb interaction ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the sda can be interpreted as an extension of their @xmath80-perturbation theory@xcite in a natural way to intermediate coupling strengths and finite temperatures and has been discussed in detail for various three - dimensional @xcite as well as infinite - dimensional@xcite lattices .",
    "at least qualitatively , it leads to rather convincing results concerning the magnetic properties of the hubbard model .",
    "a similar approach has been applied to a multiband hubbard model with surprisingly accurate results for the magnetic key - quantities of the prototype band ferromagnets fe , co , ni@xcite .",
    "recently , a generalization of the sda has been proposed to deal with the modifications due to reduced translational symmetry@xcite . in the following we give only a brief derivation of the sda solution and refer the reader to previous papers for a detailed discussion@xcite .",
    "the basic quantity to be calculated is the retarded single - electron green function @xmath81 .",
    "from @xmath82 we obtain all relevant information on the system .",
    "its diagonal elements , for example , determine the spin- and layer - dependent quasiparticle density of states ( qdos ) @xmath83 .",

    "we adopt the local approximation for the self - energy which has been tested recently for the case of reduced translational symmetry@xcite .",
    "if we assume translational invariance within each layer of the film we have @xmath86 .",
    "after fourier transformation with respect to the two - dimensional bravais lattice the equation of motion ( [ eq_motion ] ) is formally solved by matrix inversion .    the decisive step is to find a reasonable approximation for the self - energy @xmath87 .",
    "guided by the exactly solvable atomic limit of vanishing hopping ( @xmath88 ) and by the findings of harris and lange in the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath89 ) , a one - pole ansatz for the self - energy @xmath87 can be motivated @xcite .",

    "it can be shown by comparing various approximation schemes @xcite that an inclusion of the first four moments of the qdos ( @xmath92 ) is vital for a proper description of ferromagnetism in the hubbard model .",
    "further , the inclusion of the first four moments represents a necessary condition to be consistent with the @xmath80-perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation recovers the first two moments ( @xmath93 ) only , while the so - called hubbard - i solution@xcite reproduces the third moment ( @xmath94 ) as well , but is well known to be hardly able to describe ferromagnetism .",
    "taking into account the first four moments to fix the free parameters of our ansatz we end up with the sda solution which is characterized by the following self - energy : @xmath95 the self - energy depends on the spin - dependent occupation numbers @xmath96 as well as on the so - called bandshift @xmath97 which consists of higher correlation functions : @xmath98 a possible spin dependence of @xmath97 opens up the way to ferromagnetic solutions@xcite .",

    "compared to the inner layers , the surface magnetization decreases significantly faster as a function of temperature , tending to a reduced curie temperature .",

    "[ fig_8 ] the ratio @xmath170 of a three - layer film is plotted as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath171 for different band occupations @xmath172 . above @xmath173 and below @xmath174 the fcc(100 ) hubbard film does not have ferromagnetic solutions whereas between @xmath174 and @xmath175 there is a tendency towards first order phase transition as a function of temperature@xcite and no realistic rt is possible .    the ratio @xmath170 ( fig .  [ fig_8 ] ) decreases as a function of temperature for all band occupations . for @xmath115 which has been considered in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] , it changes from @xmath176 at @xmath19 to @xmath177 close to @xmath131 .",
    "however , for higher band occupations this strong temperature - dependent change in @xmath170 diminishes . from the discussion above it is clear that this is unfavorable for the rt . we can thus conclude from fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] that the possibility of a temperature - driven rt sensitively depends on the band occupation @xmath104 .",
    "in addition we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] the ratio @xmath170 calculated within hartree - fock theory .",
    "the result is completely different . at low temperatures we find @xmath178 whereas @xmath179 close to @xmath131 .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath170 is almost constant for the wide temperature range @xmath180 .",
    "therefore , a realistic temperature - driven rt is excluded within the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "this holds for all parameters that have been considered here .",
    "we have applied a generalization of the spectral - density approach ( sda ) to thin hubbard films .",
    "the sda which reproduces the exact results of the @xmath80-perturbation theory in the strong coupling limit , leads to rather convincing results concerning the magnetic properties .",
    "the magnetic behavior of the itinerant - electron film can be microscopically understood by means of the temperature - dependent electronic structure .    for an fcc(100 )",
    "film geometry the layer - dependent magnetizations have been discussed as a function of temperature as well as film thickness .",
    "the magnetization in the surface layer is found to be reduced with respect to the inner layers for all thicknesses and temperatures . by analyzing the layer - dependent qdos",
    "this reduction can be explained by the fact that in the free bdos both variance and skewness are diminished in the surface - layer compared to the inner layers .",
    "the inclusion of the dipole interaction and an effective layer - dependent anisotropy field allows to study the temperature - driven rt .",
    "the second - order anisotropy constants have been calculated within a perturbational approach . for appropriate strengths of the surface and volume anisotropy fields both types of rt , from out - of - plane to in - plane ( fe - type ) and from in - plane to out - of - plane ( ni - type ) magnetization are found . for the ni - type scenario",
    "the inclusion of a positive volume anisotropy is necessary .",
    "the rt in our itinerant model system is mediated by a strong reduction of the surface magnetization with respect to the inner layers as a function of temperature . here",
    "a close similarity to the model calculations within heisenberg - type systems is apparent , despite the fact that these models completely ignore the itinerant nature of the magnetic moments in the underlying transition - metal samples .",
    "contrary to heisenberg films , the band occupation @xmath104 enters as an additional parameter within an itinerant - electron model .",
    "we find that the possibility of a rt sensitively depends on the band occupation .",
    "the fact that no realistic rt is possible within hartree - fock theory clearly points out the importance of a reasonable treatment of electron correlation effects ."
