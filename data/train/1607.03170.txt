    "numerous novel carbon allotropes @xcite have been predicted theoretically over the past decades . some of these proposed structures have excellent mechanical , optical and/or electronic properties , which are important for a wide range of potential applications .",
    "for example ,",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) metallic carbon allotropes @xcite are potentially important conductors with excellent chemical inertness under ambient conditions , and carbon allotropes with high elastic constants but low densities like clathrates @xcite would be especially useful for light - weight structural materials .",
    "however , it is particularly challenging to synthesize these materials from pure carbon , due to their relatively higher enthalpies than graphite or diamond , and only limited experimental evidence for these phases currently exists @xcite .",
    "another way to synthesize pure carbon allotropes is to start from carbide precursors .",
    "this approach has been successful in the production of so - called carbide - derived carbon @xcite .",
    "novel silicon and germanium allotropes may be produced through the leaching of metal atoms from metal silicide or germanide precursors @xcite , which suggests the possibility of making pure carbon allotropes from metal carbides in a similar way . considering that carbon atoms have a smaller radius than silicon atoms , we focus on the possibility of carbon framework - based lithium carbides . in order to establish potential thermodynamic stability for these types of structures ,",
    "we have investigated li - c compounds over a broad compositional range to understand which kinds of precursors might exist under ambient and high - pressure conditions , and to gain insights into the forms of carbon existing within them .    a series of lithium carbon binary compounds ( including li@xmath5c@xcite , li@xmath8c@xcite , li@xmath1c@xcite , li@xmath2c@xcite , li@xmath4c@xmath2@xcite , li@xmath3c@xcite , li@xmath1c@xmath2@xcite , li@xmath3c@xmath3@xcite , li@xmath1c@xmath8@xcite , lic@xmath3@xcite , lic@xmath2@xcite , lic@xmath5@xcite , lic@xmath9@xcite , and lic@xmath0@xcite , etc . )",

    "etc.)@xcite have been investigated experimentally in their crystal structures .",
    "ab initio density functional theory calculations have many successful examples of predicting the relative stabilities for solid crystal phases of single elements and multicomponent compounds under ambient and high - pressure conditions .",
    "some methods including random sampling @xcite , minima hopping @xcite and those implemented in uspex @xcite , calypso @xcite or xtalopt @xcite were developed in the past decade and have made the prediction of ground state crystal structures much easier and more efficient @xcite . in the system of lithium carbon compounds , some searches were performed previously for the stoichiometry li@xmath3c@xmath3 @xcite and some polymeric forms of carbon were predicted at high pressure @xcite . in this work , we predict two more stable high - pressure phases of li@xmath3c@xmath3 . we provide the static convex hulls ( _ i.e. _ , formation enthalpy vs concentration diagrams ) at 0 and 40 gpa , and thus predict a broad range of novel , thermodynamically stable , lithium carbide phases .",

    "we predict the gs crystal structures of lithium carbides through evolutionary algorithm - based searching methods , as implemented in the opensource package xtalopt @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary algorithms in xtalopt were designed to generate new structures that have lower enthalpies than structures in previous generations .",
    "all searches were initialized by 3060 randomized or specified structures , and they were not terminated until the lowest enthalpy structure survived after 300600 generated structures .",
    "each search used a fixed number of formula units of li@xmath10c@xmath11 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 are irreducible integers except in li@xmath3c@xmath3 , where the reducible notation is preserved following standard convention ) .",

    "were performed to avoid missing the true ground state structure . for computational efficiency , the largest number of primitive cell atoms was limited to 20 in all searches .",
    "the symmetries of low - enthalpy structures were refined using findsym @xcite .",
    "the enthalpy of each structure within the evolutionary algorithm searching was calculated from dft relaxation using the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
