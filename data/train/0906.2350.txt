    "the recent cosmological data from cosmic microwave background anisotropies , galaxy surveys and luminosity distance of type ia supernovae are all providing supporting evidence for a dark energy component , responsable for more than @xmath1 of the total energy budget in our universe ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several candidates have been suggested for explaining this component , as , for example , minimally coupled scalar fields ( see e.q .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . however , it may also be that the cosmological evidence for acceleration comes from the wrong assumption of general relativity , i.e. that no dark component is present but actually a modification to gravity is at work . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath0 theories seem to provide a quite large number of viable models ( for a recent review see @xcite and @xcite ) . a particular @xmath0 model that evades solar system test has been proposed by hu and sawicki ( @xcite , hs hereafter ) .",

    "this model is able to reproduce the late time accelerated universe but with distinctive deviations from a cosmological constant . in this paper",
    "we investigate the cosmological viability of the hs model in more detail .",
    "after a brief description of the model , in the next section we will show that the hs model satisfies indeed the general conditions presented by @xcite as a viable @xmath0 model . in sec .",
    "iii we compare the hs model with current data from sn - ia luminosity distances from the union catalog ( @xcite ) , baryonic acoustic oscillation data ( @xcite ) and age constraints from the analysis of simon , verde and jimenez ( @xcite ) .",
    "we show that the current data is fully compatible with the hs model and that , unless a prior on the matter density is used , the parameters of the model are unconstrained .",
    "in particular , we analyze the impact of the hs model in the determination of the current matter density .",
    "as we will show , assuming the hs model instead of the standard cosmological model , could relax the constraints on the effective matter density .",
    "a future incompatibility between the values of the matter density @xmath10 determined from different datasets and under the assumption of the standard @xmath11cdm model could therefore provide an hint for a modified gravity scenario .",
    "let us briefly review in this section the basic equations and results of the hs model . varying the action in eq .",
    "1 with respect to the metric @xmath12 one obtains the modified einstein equations :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 and assuming a flat frw metric , the modified friedmann equation :    @xmath16    with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the matter density at present time . + defining the new variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 the friedmann equations can be expanded in a system of two ordinary differential equations :    @xmath21    @xmath22\\ ] ]    in order to compare the hs model with the cosmological constraints usually derived under the assumption of dark energy , it is useful to introduce an _ effective _ dark energy component with present energy density @xmath23 and equation of state @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the effective matter energy density at present time .",
    "+ of course , in reality no dark energy component is present , the only component present is matter and modified gravity gives the acceleration . considering the friedmann equation :    @xmath26}{a}}}\\ ] ]    the effective equation of state parameter @xmath24 for the dark energy component is given by    @xmath27    the free parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 that appear in eq .",
    "2 can be expressed in function of the effective density parameters by :    @xmath28    @xmath29    these relations show that the free parameters of the model are @xmath25 , @xmath9 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the latter is constrained to @xmath31 by solar system tests @xcite and we will not investigate larger values in the next sections . + solving the differential equations system for different values of @xmath9 , @xmath30 and @xmath25 , it is possible to obtain various evolution trends for the equation of state parameter @xmath24 . in fig.[wn1 ] and fig.[wn2 ] we plot the behavior of @xmath24 in function of the redshift @xmath32 for different values of @xmath30 and @xmath9 .",

    "( @xmath38 ) @xmath24 has always a value higher than the one predicted by the @xmath11cdm model ( @xmath39 ) and , moving towards higher redshifts , it decreases crossing into the phantom region , i.e. , assuming values lower than @xmath40 . for even higher redshifts , @xmath24 moves asymptotically towards @xmath40 .",
    "+ the same behavior is shown for any value of @xmath9 and @xmath30 , moreover decreasing the absolute value of @xmath30 brings @xmath24 closer to @xmath40 , while increasing @xmath9 shifts the phantom crossing at lower redshift .     for @xmath41 and @xmath30 equal to @xmath34 ( solid line ) , @xmath35 (",

    "@xmath25 is set to @xmath37,width=415 ]    the modification of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian brings to a new equation for the expansion of the universe .",
    "the predicted expansion must be consistent with standard cosmological results , i.e. , should produce an accelerated era after radiation and matter dominance .",
    "+ modified gravity models consistent with current observations , for example , should not change the scale factor evolution during the matter era . hence , it is possible to derive general conditions for the cosmological viability of @xmath0 theories . + introducing the parameters    @xmath42    it is possible to show @xcite that for @xmath0 theories the following conditions apply :    *",

    "the solid line corresponds to the viable solution while the dashed line lies outside the viability region .",
    "the red line shows the solution @xmath49.,width=415 ]    it is possible to calculate @xmath50 for the hu and sawicki model and to show the cosmological viability of this model . in fig.[m(r ) ] we show that , for example , setting @xmath33 , @xmath47 and @xmath51 , one obtains two solutions for @xmath50 , one living outside the viability region and the other corresponding to an acceptable expansion .",
    "in order to constrain the free parameters of the hu and sawicki model ( @xmath25 , @xmath9 and @xmath30 ) , we predicted the expected theoretical values for a set of observables . + as now common in the literature , we considered the luminosity distance , defined by :    @xmath52    and the hubble parameter :    @xmath53    moreover , we also considered the quantity :    @xmath54^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the value of this parameter can be obtained from observations of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite .",
    "hence , we have another way to compare model prediction with data .",
    "+ we used the superovae data from kowalski et al .",
    "@xcite to obtain the observational trend of @xmath58 and we considered @xmath59 values obtained by simon , verde and jimenez @xcite and a prior on the hubble parameter @xmath60 derived from measurements from the hubble space telescope ( hst , @xcite ) , finally , we used the value of @xmath61 from eisenstein et al .",
    "@xcite . + we compute a @xmath62 variable for each observational quantity and then combine the results in a single variable @xmath63 .",

    "+      combining the results obtained from the comparison between the experimental data for @xmath59 , @xmath61 and @xmath58 and their theoretical values , we can constrain the free parameters @xmath9 and @xmath30 for different values of @xmath25 and @xmath66 .",

    "+ we can note anyway that for higher values of @xmath25 , higher @xmath9 are preferred , while smaller values of @xmath9 are more in agreement with data for smaller @xmath25 . + as we can see from figure [ chi37 ] , for @xmath47 both parameters are almost totally unconstrained ; this points out the need of an independent measurement of the effective matter content ( @xmath25 ) in order to obtain some constraints on @xmath9 and @xmath30 .",
    "+ it is interesting to compare the best fit values of @xmath62 obtained in the modified gravity framework with the @xmath62 of a cosmological constant model . in order to quantify the goodness - of - fit of the two models we use the akaike information criterion ( aic ) @xcite and the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) @xcite , defined as @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the maximum likelihood , @xmath79 the number of parameters and @xmath80 the number of points . +     for the standard case of a cosmological constant ( dashed line ) and for the hs model ( solid line).,width=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ aic ] we plot the best fit values of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 tests in function of @xmath25 for the standard model based on a cosmological constant and the hs model respectively .",
    "as we can see , while the cosmological constant gives slightly better values for the overall best fit , when larger or smaller values of @xmath25 are considered the @xmath81 and @xmath82 tests provide definitly better values for the hs model . in few words",
    ", there is a weaker dependence of the observables considered from @xmath25 in the case of hs scenario .     for the hu and sawicki model ( thicker lines ) and @xmath83 model ( fainter lines).,width=491 ]    it is therefore important to quantify the impact of a different choice of the theoretical background model on the derived constraints on @xmath25 .",
    "[ limitiom ] we compare the constraints on the @xmath25 parameter derived under the assumption of the hs scenario with the similar constraints but assuming general relativity and dark energy . as we can see",
    "the @xmath25 parameter is less constrained respect to the @xmath11cdm scenario .",
    "this is certainly due to the larger amount of parameters present in the hs model . in the future , with the increasing experimental accuracy , if a discrepancy between independent constraints on the matter density will be found then a modified gravity scenario could be suggested as possible explanation .",
    "this result anyway shows that one should also be extremely careful in considering the current cosmological constraints because of their model dependence .",
    "in this paper we have compared a modified gravity scenario , the hs model , with several current cosmological datasets .",
    "we have found that the model is in excellent agreement with recent sn - ia , bao and @xmath59 data .",
    "moreover , the parameters of the model are substantially unconstrained by the data considered .",
    "this has important effect on the current constraints on some parameters as the matter density .",
    "we have shown that the assumption of the hs model enlarges the current constraints on this parameter by @xmath84 .",
    "if a discrepancy between two experimental determinations of the matter density will be found in the framework of general relativity , then a possible solution could be the introduction of a modified gravity scenario",
