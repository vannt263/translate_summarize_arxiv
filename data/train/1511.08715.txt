    "a widely recognized consensus is that the fifth - generation ( 5 g ) systems will be capable of providing significant energy efficiency and system capacity improvements  .",
    "promising techniques , such as large - scale mimo ( ls - mimo ) and spatial modulation ( sm)-mimo systems are considered as potent candidates for 5 g  @xcite .",
    "ls - mimo employing hundreds of antenna elements ( aes ) at the base station ( bs ) is capable of improving the spectral efficiency by orders of magnitude , but it suffers from the nonnegligible power consumption and hardware cost due to one specific rf chain usually required by every ae  @xcite . by using a reduced number of rf chains ,",
    "the emerging sm - mimo activates part of available aes to transmit extra information in the spatial domain , and it has attracted much attention due to its high energy efficiency and reduced hardware cost  @xcite . however , conventional sm - mimo is usually considered in the downlink of small - scale mimo systems , and therefore its achievable capacity is limited .",
    "individually , both technologies have their own advantages and drawbacks . by an effective combination of them",
    "together , one can envision the win - win situation .",
    "sm - mimo is attractive for ls - mimo systems , since the reduced number of required rf chains in sm - mimo can reduce the power consumption and hardware cost in conventional ls - mimo systems .",
    "moveover , hundreds of aes used in ls - mimo can improve the system throughput of sm - mimo .",
    "such reciprocity enables ls - mimo and sm - mimo to enjoy the apparent compatibility .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a ls - sm - mimo scheme for intrinsically amalgamating the compelling benefits of both ls - mimo and sm - mimo for the 5 g uplink ( ul ) over frequency - selective fading channels . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "each ul - user equipped with multiple aes but only a single rf chain invokes sm for increasing the ul - throughput , and the cyclic - prefix single - carrier ( cpsc ) transmission scheme is adopted to combat the multipath channels @xcite . at the bs , hundreds of aes but",
    "only dozens of rf chains are employed to simultaneously serve multiple users , and a direct ae selection scheme is used to improve the system performance over correlated rayleigh - fading mimo channels at the bs @xcite .",
    "the proposed scheme can be adopted in conventional ls - mimo as a specific ul - transmission mode for reducing the power consumption , or altarenatively , for energy- and cost - efficient ls - sm - mimo , where joint benefits of efficient ae selection  @xcite , transmit precoding  @xcite , and channel estimation  @xcite can be readily exploited . to sum up",
    ", the proposed scheme inherits the advantages of ls - mimo and sm - mimo , while reducing the power consumption and hardware cost .",
    "a challenging problem in the proposed ul ls - sm - mimo scheme is how to realize a reliable multi - user detector ( mud ) with low complexity .",
    "the optimal maximum likelihood ( ml ) signal detector suffers from the excessive complexity .",
    "conventional sphere decoding detectors can not be readily used in multi - user scenarios and may still appear the high complexity for ls - sm - mimo  @xcite .",
    "existing low - complexity linear signal detectors , e.g. , the minimum mean square error ( mmse)-based signal detector , perform well for conventional ls - mimo systems  @xcite . however , they are unsuitable for the proposed ls - sm - mimo ul - transmission , since the large number of transmit aes of the ul - users and the reduced number of receive rf chains at the bs make the ul multi - user signal detection be a large - scale under - determined / rank - deficient problem . the authors of  @xcite proposed compressive sensing ( cs)-based signal detectors to solve the under - determined signal detection problem in sm - mimo systems , but they only considered the single - user small - scale sm - mimo systems in the downlink .    against this background ,",
    "our new contribution is that we exploit the specific signal structure in the proposed multi - user ls - sm - mimo ul - transmission , where each user only activates a single ae in each time slot .",
    "hence the sm signal of each ul - user is sparse with the sparsity level of one , and the aggregate sm signal consisting of multiple ul - users sm signals in one cpsc block exhibits a certain distributed sparsity , which can be beneficially exploited for improving the signal detection performance at the bs .",
    "moreover , we propose a joint sm transmission scheme for the ul - users in conjunction with an appropriately structured compressive sensing ( scs)-based mud at the bs . the proposed scs - based mud is specifically tailored to leverage the inherently distributed sparsity of the aggregate sm signal and the group sparsity of multiple aggregate sm signals owing to the joint sm transmission scheme for reliable signal detection performance .",
    "our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scs - based mud is capable of outperforming the conventional detectors even with higher ul - throughput .",

    "it has been shown that the main power consumption and hardware cost of cellular networks comes from the radio access network  @xcite . hence , using a reduced number of expensive rf chains compared to the total number of aes at the bs can substantially reduce both the power consumption and the hardware cost for the operators .",

    "the resultant increased degrees of freedom in the spatial domain may then be exploited for improving the ul - throughput .",

    "@xmath37 is generated by mapping @xmath38 bits to the index of the active ae , and typically the user terminal employs @xmath39 aes , where @xmath1 is a positive integer .",

    "hence , each ul - user s sm signal carries the information of @xmath45 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) , and the overall ul - throughput is @xmath46 bpcu .",
    "users utilize the cpsc scheme to transmit sm signals @xcite .",

    "to solve the multi - user signal detection of our ul ls - sm - mimo system , we first propose a joint sm transmission scheme to be employed at the users .",

    "although exhibiting group sparsity may slightly reduce the information carried by the spatial constellation symbols , it is also capable of reducing the number of the rf chains required according to the scs theory , whilst simultaneously improving the total bit error rate ( ber ) of the entire system even with higher ul - throughput .",

    "<S> conventional spatial modulation ( sm ) is typically considered for transmission in the downlink of small - scale mimo systems , where a single one of a set of say @xmath0 antenna elements ( aes ) is activated for implicitly conveying @xmath1 bits . by contrast , inspired by the compelling benefits of large - scale mimo ( ls - mimo ) systems , here we propose a ls - sm - mimo scheme for the uplink ( ul ) , where each user having multiple aes but only a single radio frequency ( rf ) chain invokes sm for increasing the ul - throughput . at the same time , by relying on hundreds of aes but a small number of rf chains , the base station ( bs ) can simultaneously serve multiple users whilst reducing the power consumption . </S>",
    "<S> due to the large number of aes of the ul - users and the comparably small number of rf chains at the bs , the ul multi - user signal detection becomes a challenging large - scale under - determined problem . to solve this problem , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a joint sm transmission scheme and a carefully designed structured compressive sensing ( scs)-based multi - user detector ( mud ) to be used at the users and bs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the cyclic - prefix single - carrier ( cpsc ) is used to combat the multipath channels , and a simple receive ae selection is used for the improved performance over correlated rayleigh - fading mimo channels . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the aggregate sm signal consisting of multiple ul - users sm signals in one cpsc block appears the distributed sparsity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to the joint sm transmission scheme , aggregate sm signals in the same transmission group exhibit the group sparsity . by exploiting these intrinsically sparse features </S>",
    "<S> , the proposed scs - based mud can reliably detect the resultant sm signals with low complexity . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scs - based mud achieves a better signal detection performance than its counterparts even with higher ul - throughtput .    </S>",
