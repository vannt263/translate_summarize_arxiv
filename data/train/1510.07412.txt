    "in a previous paper @xcite , we presented the selection of a sample of double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2 ) for which it will be possible to derive accurately the masses of the components when the astrometric measurements of the _ gaia _ satellite will be delivered . our aim is to obtain high - precision radial velocity ( rv ) measurements in order to derive the minimum masses of the components , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the masses and @xmath4 is the inclination of the orbital plane on the plane of the sky .",
    "the _ gaia _",
    "astrometric measurements of the photocentre of these systems will lead to the derivation of astrometric orbits , including @xmath4 , and therefore to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the rv measurements are obtained through two different programs : a programme of about 70 sb2 is carried on with the t193 telescope of the haute - provence observatory ( _ ohp _ ) with the _ sophie _ spectrograph , and a separate programme of seven sb2 is using the mercator 1.2m  telescope at the roque de los muchachos observatory ( _ rmo _ ) , with the _ hermes _ spectrograph @xcite .    despite the high quality that is expected for the _ gaia _ measurements , we know from the reduction of the _ hipparcos _ satellite @xcite that large space astrometric surveys may be prone to systematic errors .",
    "the discussion about the reliability of the _ hipparcos _ results is still not closed : recently , @xcite found an important discrepancy between the parallax he obtained for the system hd 207651 , and the parallax given in the _ hipparcos 2 _ catalogue @xcite , even when the orbital motion is taken into account .",
    "the large variations affecting the basic angle of _ gaia _ will make the verification of the _ gaia _ measurements even more necessary @xcite .",
    "regarding double stars , a good orbit determination with _ gaia _ depends on the measurements at various epochs , and ultimately rely on the application of the point spread function ( psf ) calibration , considering the object as a single star .",
    "binaries may then be sensitive to small differences between the position given by the psf and the position of the actual photocentre .",
    "therefore , an independent derivation of the masses of some stars of our sample is welcome in order to validate our future results .    for these reasons",
    ", we obtained interferometric measurements with the _ pionier _ instrument at the very large telescope interferometer ( _ vlti _ ) .",
    "after one semester , three sb2s were observed over nearly half of their period .",
    "two of these systems are from the _ ohp _ programme , and the other is from the _ rmo _ programme .",
    "hip  14157 is a couple of chromospherically active k - dwarf stars which was noticed by @xcite for their large minimum masses .",
    "hip  20601 is a hyades binary star observed by @xcite , and that seems also to have components with masses above expectations .",

    "mid - december 2014 , the detector of _ pionier _ was changed to the new _ rapid _ detector , and therefore observations obtained in 2015 were obtained with the new observing mode , sampling the fringes over six spectral channels . the large _ vlti _ configuration a1g1k0j3 was used  except on the nights of 1517 nov .",

    "this point is especially important hereafter , since several parameters in the common solution leading to the masses are coming as well from the interferometric observations as from the spectroscopic ones .",
    "this applies to the period @xmath15 , the eccentricity @xmath16 , the epoch of the periastron @xmath17 and the periastron longitude @xmath18 .",
    "overestimating the uncertainties of the interferometric observations would lead to underestimate the weights of these observations and to exaggerate the contribution of the rv in the derivation of these terms , and vice versa .    to verify the uncertainties ,",
    "the `` visual '' orbit of the star is derived . computing a visual orbit",
    "consists in searching seven unknowns : the period , @xmath15 , the eccentricity , @xmath16 , the epoch of the periastron , @xmath17 , and the thiele - innes elements @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , a minimum of eight observations is needed to derive these terms and to estimate their errors . since",
    "a relative position is a two - dimensional observation , this corresponds to four interferometric observations . for the least observed star , which is hip  20601 , we have six interferometric observations , resulting in five degrees of freedom in the derivation of the orbit .",
    "this is sufficient to allow the verification of the error estimations .",
    "we derive the orbit of each binary , and we calculate @xmath23 , the estimator of the goodness - of - fit defined in @xcite :    @xmath24\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the number of degrees of freedom and @xmath26 is the weighted sum of the squares of the differences between the predicted and the observed values , normalised with respect to their uncertainties . when the predicted values are obtained through a linear model , @xmath23 follows the normal distribution @xmath27 . when non  linear models are used , but when the errors are small in comparison to the measurements , as hereafter , the model is approximately linear around the solution , and @xmath23 follows also @xmath27 .",
    "we also used simulations to verify that this property is true even when the number of degrees of freedom is as small as five .",
    "it appears that , when the uncertainties provided by the _",
    "reduction are taken into account , @xmath23 is systematically negative .",
    "this indicates that these uncertainties are overestimated . in order to keep the relative weights of the observations ,",
    "the uncertainties of the positions of any star are divided by the same coefficient , in order to have @xmath28 .",
    "the uncertainties @xmath12 and @xmath11 in table  [ tab : mespio ] are thus obtained .",
    "it is worth noticing that they are similar to the errors expected for _ gaia _ @xcite .",
    "radial velocity measurements are obtained from the sb9 catalogue @xcite , which is regularly updated and accessible on - line .",
    "primarily , the spectroscopic orbits of these stars were derived assigning weights to the measurements of the primary and of the secondary component .",
    "since our purpose is to derive masses not only from these measurements , but also from new rv measurements and from interferometric observations , it is necessary to convert these weights to reliable uncertainties .    to evaluate the uncertainty of the rv of any component , the single - lined orbit of the star is derived .",
    "the weights of the rv measurements are transformed to uncertainties in order to get a sb1 orbit with @xmath28 .",
    "it is worth noticing that this method is similar in its principle to the usual approach consisting in taking for the uncertainty the standard deviation of the residuals of the rv .",
    "however , it is much more reliable and it leads to uncertainties significantly larger .    when the rv uncertainties are obtained for both components , the sb2 orbit is derived , and @xmath23 is calculated again .",
    "a correction coefficient is applied to have at the end an sb2 orbit again with @xmath28 .",
    "this method leads to the following results :    * for hip  14157 , the uncertainty of the rv measured by @xcite is 0.582 and 0.677 km s@xmath29 for the primary and for the secondary component , respectively . *",
    "the standard procedure requires an adaptation for the treatment of the rv measurements provided by @xcite for hip  20601 .",
    "no weights are indicated by the authors , but 7 of the 63 measurements of the primary component are flagged as uncertain , and the secondary component received only 4 rv measurements .",
    "we assign 0.843  km s@xmath29 to the uncertainty of the 56 `` not uncertain '' rv measurements , in order to get an sb1 orbit with @xmath28 .",
    "the uncertainty of the `` uncertain '' primary rv is then 1.504  km s@xmath29 , in order to still have @xmath28 for the sb1 orbit of the primary component .",
    "the uncertainty of the rv of the secondary component is then 3.000  km s@xmath29 , in order to have @xmath28 for the sb2 orbit of the binary . * for hip  117186 ,",
    "the uncertainty of the rv measured by @xcite is 1.837 and 1.487 km s@xmath29 for the primary and for the secondary component , respectively .",
    "the sets of rv of the three stars are further completed with high - accuracy measurements recently obtained .",
    "hip  14157 received 8 rv measurements between january 2015 and august 2015 .",
    "the fibre - fed _ hermes _ spectrograph covers the whole wavelength range from 380 to 900  nm at a resolving power of @xmath30 .",
    "a python - based pipeline extracts a wavelength - calibrated and a cosmic - ray cleaned spectrum . a restricted region , covering the range 478.11",
    " 653.56  nm ( orders 55  74 ) was used to derive a cross - correlation function ( ccf ) with a spectral mask constructed from an arcturus spectrum and containing 2103 useful spectral lines . a spectrum with a signal - to - noise ratio of 15",
    "is usually sufficient to obtain a cross - correlation function ( ccf ) with a well - pronounced maximum .",
    "radial velocities are determined from a gaussian fit to the core of the ccf with an internal precision of a few m  s@xmath29 .",
    "the most important external source of error is the varying atmospheric pressure in the spectrograph room ( see fig .  9 of * ? ?",
    "* ) , which is largely eliminated by the arc spectra taken for wavelength calibration .",
    "the long - term stability ( years ) of the resulting radial velocities is checked with rv standard stars from @xcite .",
    "their standard - deviation distribution peaks at @xmath31  m  s@xmath29 , which we adopt as the typical radial - velocity uncertainty for such relatively bright single stars .",
    "the rv standard stars have also been used to tie the _ hermes _ rvs to the iau standard system .    for a sb2 system",
    ", the reduction process leads to estimations of the uncertainties of the rv which are obviously underestimated , due to the pollution of the spectrum of each component by that of the other one .",
    "this appears clearly when the orbital elements are derived from the 8 _ hermes _ observations of hip 14157 : the goodness - of - fit of the sb2 solution is as large as @xmath32 , and the standard deviations of the residuals are 0.138 and 0.219  km  s@xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we assume then that the ratio of the true uncertainties is @xmath33 .",
    "the uncertainties are then increased , by adding quadratically a noise depending on the component , until we have @xmath28 .",
    "this condition is fulfilled with the noises 0.187 and 0.298  km s@xmath29 , respectively .",
    "this method is a bit different from the one applied above to derive the uncertainties of the previously published measurements , since the correction of the uncertainties is not done separately for each component .",
    "however , it is more suitable for an sb2 with few observations .",
    "the rvs of the components of hip  14157 and the uncertainties thus obtained are listed in table  [ tab : vr ] .",
    "hip  20601 and hip  117186 received 12 and 7 _ sophie _ spectra , respectively , between december 2010 and december 2014 .",
    "the rv of the components are derived using the two - dimensional correlation algorithm _ todcor _",
    "@xcite , as explained hereafter .",
    "the _ todcor _ algorithm calculates the cross - correlation of an sb2 spectrum and two best - matching stellar atmosphere models , one for each component of the observed binary system .",
    "this two - dimensional cross - correlation function ( 2d - ccf ) is maximized at the radial velocities of both components .",
    "the multi - order version of _ todcor _ , named _ todmor",
    "_  @xcite , determines the radial velocities of both components from the gathering of the 2d - ccf obtained from each order of the spectrum .",
    "all _ sophie _ multi - orders spectra are deblazed , then pseudo - continuum normalised using a @xmath34-percentile filter  @xcite .",
    "the percentile @xmath34=@xmath35 selects the median among all flux values contained within the filter s window ; any @xmath34@xmath36@xmath35 selects flux with value larger than the median .",
    "the percentile @xmath34 and the width @xmath37 of the filtering window are chosen so that the resulting normalised spectra are as flat as possible , while not altering the depth and shape of any lines .",
    "these constraints led us to chose for both targets @xmath381,300 pixels ( @xmath633 ) ; the width of one _ sophie _ order is about @xmath39 pixels ( @xmath6100 ) ; 33  is about twice the full width at half - maximum for a balmer line of early - type stars and for ca ii lines of late - type stars .",
    "the value of @xmath34 was determined independently for each order by maximising the two dimensional cross - correlation .",
    "we determined for the two components of each binary best - matching atmospheric models from the _ phoenix _ library  @xcite . for consistency",

    "for which both peaks of the sb2 components are well separated , we optimized the two - dimensional cross - correlation function varying the effective temperature , the stellar rotation s @xmath41 , the metallicity and the surface gravity s @xmath42 of both components .",
    "the grid for optimisation is defined with @xmath43 extending from 3,000 to 6,900  k with steps of 100  k and from 7,000 to 11,000 with steps of 200  k ; @xmath44 extending from 2 to 6 dex with steps of 0.5 and linearly interpolated from 4 to 5.5 with steps of 0.1 ; [ fe / h ] extending from @xmath45 to 1 dex with steps of 0.5 and linearly interpolated from @xmath46 to 0.5 with steps of 0.1 ; @xmath47 extending continuously from 0 to 200  km.s@xmath29 ; and the flux ratio , @xmath48 , extending continuously from 0 to 1 .",

    "the derived values of the stellar parameters are given for both components in table  [ tab : stellpar ] .",
    "for hip  117186 only one spectrum had large enough separation between the primary and secondary peaks , namely the spectrum observed at periastron passage .",
