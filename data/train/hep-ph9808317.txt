    "supersymmetry is one of the most promising scenarios in terms of which one can approach new physics at the present and next generation of colliders ( lepii , upgraded cdf , lhc , lc2000 , ... ) . in this context , the awaited discovery of a neutral higgs particle , if successful , will need to be complemented by the discovery and study of the full - fledged higgs sector as well as the purely supersymmetric sector , in order to test unambiguously the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite or possibly its non - minimal extensions @xcite .",
    "such a task will presumably be rather intricate as any realistic supersymmetric model predicts a plethora of particles and associated couplings .",
    "it should also comprise a full test of the various mass - sum - rules and relations among the couplings endemic to supersymmetry @xcite , these being , in some cases , sensibly modified by radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "these large modifications can be crucial in the experimental search strategy .",
    "perhaps the most illustrative example is the loosening of the mssm tree - level mass bound for the lightest cp - even higgs roughly from @xmath5 $ \\sim$}}~}m_z^2 + g^2 \\frac{3 m_t^4}{8 \\pi^2 m_w^2 }",

    ". some of these have been already looked at @xcite in a model dependent context , however ultimately a systematic exploration of all regions of susy parameters leading to potentially large deviations that can affect tree level relations as well as production and decay rates of new particles , would become mandatory in order to achieve full tests of susy .",
    "indeed there is _ a priori _ no guarantee that moderate corrections to a given observable will ensure moderate corrections to all other observables related to the same given sector .",
    "the subject of the present paper is the one - loop electroweak corrections to the charged higgs pair production in @xmath7 collisions .",
    "this will turn out to be precisely an example where important effects are present in the production cross - section , even though corrections to the @xmath8 mass sum rule are known to be modest @xcite .",
    "( loop corrections to @xmath8 decays are also important to study @xcite but will not be considered in this paper ) .",
    "generally speaking , a charged scalar particle coupled to fermions proportionally to their masses is a by - product of an extended higgs sector with scalar fields in non - singlet representations of the weak symmetry . as such its experimental discovery would thus be immediate qualitative evidence in favor of a structure beyond the standard model , in contrast with the neutral higgs which would necessitate a more quantitative investigation .",
    "present experimental direct search for charged higgses set lower bound on its mass . at lep  ii search , aleph and opal collaborations set a lower bound of 52 gev and delphi collaboration sets a lower bound of 54.4 gev @xcite . at the tevatron ,",
    "cdf collaboration has searched for charged higgs decay of the top quark excluding a charged higgs mass lower than @xmath9 gev in the large @xmath10 limit @xcite . however , using the tevatron quark data in the lepton plus @xmath11 a lower mass limit of 100 gev for @xmath12 has been reported @xcite . for a recent discussion of the lep and tevatron limits and a reappraisal see @xcite + indirect limits , valid only in the non supersymmetric case , have been inferred from @xmath13 and read @xcite : @xmath14 see also @xcite .",
    "although supersymmetry can generically invalidate the previous indirect limit , some studies suggest that useful bounds can still be inferred in some model - dependent cases ( assuming grand unified minimal supergravity and a negative higgs mass parameter @xmath15 @xcite ) . at hadronic machines , future direct production of charged higgses",
    "can proceed either via pair production through gluon - gluon fusion @xcite or the less favoured @xmath16 annihilation drell - yan process@xcite , or via single production in association with quarks@xcite or a @xmath17 boson@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the charged higgs can be efficiently searched for only when its top - bottom decay mode is kinematically forbidden [ otherwise one would have to look at bosonic decay modes ex .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xcite , see also @xcite ] .",
    "the future @xmath7 machines will presumably offer a cleaner environment and in that sense a higher mass reach , especially if the 12tev options are available . there",
    "the charged higgs can be produced either in pairs through @xmath20 exchange@xcite , or in single rare production in association with a @xmath17 boson @xcite .",
    "the former channel has at tree - level the particularity of depending only on standard model parameters , it is thus important to understand the trend of loop effects which contain the model dependence .",
    "the one - loop electroweak corrections to @xmath21 have been previously considered at nlc energies , restricting mainly to top - bottom , squarks and sleptons contributions @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we complete the study by including the effects of the remaining sectors already summarized in .",
    "we also revise some of the numerical results previously given in @xcite .",
    "we mention here incidently that charged higgs pair production through laser back - scattered @xmath22 collisions has been studied in the literature at the tree as well as the one - loop levels @xcite reaching similar conclusions as to the importance of the quantum corrections .",
    "+ in view of the potentially large corrections the first issue here will be mainly ( but not exclusively ) , to pin down all possible large effects from other sectors than the ones considered in @xcite . for this we present the full set of one - loop corrections in a general type ii two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm - ii ) , that is the complete higgs sector contributions ( self - energies , vertices and boxes ) , the infrared part including initial and final soft photon radiation , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 boxes , as well as the ( standard ) initial state vertex and fermion and gauge boson self - energies contributions .",
    "thdm - ii , besides being interesting in its own right , is a relevant framework in terms of which to assess the sensitivity to supersymmetric effects .",
    "the second issue will be to parameterize the comparison between thdm - ii and the more constrained mssm cases .",
    "indeed it will turn out that apart from large model independent contributions in the infrared sector , important effects are found in diagrams involving triple higgs couplings , however only in the non - supersymmetric case . in order to assess the sensitivity to such effects it will be appropriate to define an effective parameterization where all the ( tree - level ) mssm higgs mass - sum - rules remain valid while some of the tree - level triple higgs couplings deviate from their mssm form .",
    "this parameterization which we will dub `` quasi - supersymmetric '' necessitates just one extra free parameter ( instead of five ) in the higgs sector , as compared to the mssm and actually offers a general setting to quantify the tests of the self - couplings in the higgs sector .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the main features of the higgs potential in thdm - ii as well as in the mssm .",
    "we then define and discuss the `` quasi - supersymmetric '' parameterization which interpolates between the two models and recall the form of the various higgs couplings . in section",
    "iii the tree - level production cross - section is presented and some notations and conventions defined .",
    "section iv is devoted to the general form of the radiative corrections and to a description of the various contributions . in section",
    "v we describe the renormalization scheme which is most suited in our case to a comparison between the supersymmetric and non  supersymmetric cases , and discuss as well the infrared sector .",
    "section vi is devoted to the numerical analysis , and section vii to the conclusion .",
    "finally , presentation of complementary analytic expressions and technical details of the calculation is relegated to the appendices .",
    "in this section we focus on the structure of the charged higgs couplings to the other higgs fields and recall as well its couplings to the gauge bosons and matter fermions , excluding the supersymmetric sector .",
    "we will refrain from presenting extensively the various features of the higgs potential , as this has been repeatedly achieved in the literature the aim here is rather to identify the tree - level couplings which can carry information about the presence of supersymmetry , distinguishing them from those which have the same form whether susy is operative or not .",
    "we then encompass these features in a suitable general parameterization .      assuming two complex @xmath26 doublet scalar fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 defined as    @xmath29 \\phi^0_{1}=\\varphi_{3}+i\\varphi_{4 } \\end{array }   \\right ) \\hspace{.8 in } \\phi_{2}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\phi^+_{2}=\\varphi_{5}+i\\varphi_{6}\\\\ [ 0.4 cm ] \\phi^0_{2}=\\varphi_{7}+i\\varphi_{8 } \\end{array }   \\right)\\ ] ]    the most general ( dimension 4 ) @xmath30 gauge invariant and ( cp - invariant ) scalar potential is given by ( see , however , the errata in ref @xcite ) : @xmath31                      & & + \\lambda_{4}((\\phi_{1}^+\\phi_{1})(\\phi_{2}^+ \\phi_{2})-(\\phi_{1}^+\\phi_{2})(\\phi_{2}^+\\phi_{1}))+                      \\lambda_{5 } ( re(\\phi^+_{1}\\phi_{2 } ) -v_{1}v_{2})^2+\\nonumber\\\\ [ 0.2 cm ]                      & & \\lambda_{6 } im(\\phi^+_{1}\\phi_{2})^2 + \\lambda_{7 } \\label{higgspot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 have weak hypercharge y=1 and the @xmath32 s are real - valued",

    "from now on we will take the physical higgs masses , @xmath54 , the mixing angles @xmath55 and the coupling @xmath56 as the 7 free parameters .",

    "will be that @xmath56 measures the `` amount '' of `` hard '' susy breaking , and that among the five couplings , only @xmath59 and @xmath60 are sensitive to such a breaking .",
    "we should also stress that no constraint has been imposed thus far , in the derivation of the preceding expressions .",
    "in particular no sign assignments for the trigonometric functions of @xmath51 or @xmath3 where made ( apart of course from the definition @xmath63 )      we proceed hereafter to the definition of a partly constrained parameterization which interpolates between the free thdm case , and the constrained mssm , in the following sense :    * it preserves _ all _ tree - level mass - sum - rules of the mssm , including the relation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; , see also discussion in section 5 ] * it needs just 3 free parameters ( instead of 7 ) and comprises the susy case as a special case with 2 free parameters ;    actually such a parameterization would be phenomenologically very natural in case where more than one higgs particle is discovered , with masses consistent with the mssm sum - rules .",
    "indeed , taking these sum - rules as granted , one can devise a strategy for further precision tests of the supersymmetric self - higgs couplings , where a reduced number of free parameters is involved and particularly sensitive sectors are identified .",
    "let us first recall the situation when softly broken supersymmetry is imposed in eq.(1 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite one has the following relations among the @xmath32 s : @xmath66 due to these five constraints one is left with two free parameters , ex . @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it should be stressed that the soft breaking , in the higgs sector , is actually encoded in this two - parameter freedom .",
    "( indeed , if exact susy were imposed , @xmath69 , then all @xmath32 s would be fixed in terms of the gauge couplings @xmath70 , together with @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , the presence ( at the tree - level ) of more than these two free parameters in the higgs sector would be associated to the hard breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "the most general parameterization of such a breaking leading back to the general thdm discussed in the previous section , can be cast in the form : @xmath73 where the @xmath74 s measure the amount of hard breaking of supersymmetry .    the various higgs masses and @xmath64",
    "can then be related to the @xmath74 s upon use of the above equations in conjunction with eq.([higgsmass][alph ] ) as , @xmath75 now the crucial point is to note that the mssm tree - level mass - sum - rules , @xmath76 @xmath77 as well as @xmath78 can be recovered _ not only in the susy case @xmath79 , but actually in a full one - parameter subspace_. indeed the validity of eq .",

    "obviously , when @xmath56 hits its supersymmetric value , i.e. when @xmath85 , we get back the mssm case , otherwise @xmath86 can be seen as measuring the `` hardness '' of the susy breaking , while @xmath68 and @xmath83 play the same role as in the mssm .",
    "there is a subtlety , however , as concerns the sign of @xmath87 .",

    "backward asymmetry is small .",
    "note that contributions from the initial @xmath267 vertices to the corrected cross section are typically standard and hence depend neither on @xmath10 nor on the charged higgs mass .",

    "the standard boxes are not very sensitive to tan@xmath3 , but can give important contributions .",

    "to discuss the contribution of the bosonic sector ( higgs bosons and gauge bosons contribution ) to the the gauge boson self energy , the final state vertex and the box contributions , we will use the qsusy parameterization described in section ii .",
    "this parameterization allows a comparison between the mssm and thdm - ii and is described only by three parameters @xmath277 , tan@xmath3 and @xmath56 .",
    "+ in fig 35 we show the percentage contribution to the integrated cross section as a function of @xmath256 and for different values of @xmath56 and @xmath83 . for @xmath278 gev",

    "energy , reaching -20 % to -25 % for @xmath281 .",
    "the correction is not very sensitive to the charged higgs mass and interferes destructively with the fermionic contribution . in general , the bosonic contributions in the mssm - like case tend to cancel the fermionic contributions for not too small ( @xmath282 ) or not too large ( @xmath283 ) values of tan@xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath56 is taken away from its supersymmetric value , the situation changes drastically . for a small deviation from @xmath279",
    "the effect is still of the same order as in the mssm , but can get large and have both signs the farther we go from @xmath279 , as can be seen from fig.3,4,5 . in some regions of the parameter space the effect can even grow too large for a relyable perturbative treatment , reaching more than 40% ( ! ) , without having enough cancellation ( if any ) from the fermionic contribution . such large effects can occur as a direct consequence of increasing @xmath83 , as illustrated in fig . 6 , but also for small @xmath83 as illustrated in fig . 4.a , 5.a when @xmath277 is large enough ( see eqs.(22 ) ) .    the total cross section @xmath284 is plotted in figures 8 and 9 for two values of @xmath277 and tan@xmath3 and for various choices of @xmath56 .",
    "shown is the summed effect of all fermionic and bosonic contributions ( initial state , final state vertex , self energies and non infrared boxes diagrams ) , excluding the gauge invariant set of diagrams containing at least one virtual photon exchange [ the numerical contribution of the latter being mainly that of the ir sector ] .",
    "when @xmath285 the net effect of radiative corrections remains small ( @xmath286 $ \\sim$}}~}5 \\%$ ] ) . in all cases",
    "we have illustrated , the one loop corrections generically decrease substantially the cross section for small @xmath83 when @xmath56 departs from @xmath279 , while for large @xmath83 the cross section can be increased in some cases .",

    "backward asymmetry @xmath147 as a function of @xmath256",
    ". as one can see from this figure , @xmath147 is small ; this is due to the fact that only box diagrams contribute , and their couplings are @xmath56 independent .",
    "future @xmath123 linear colliders will probably offer the cleanest environment to discover a heavy charged higgs through pair production .",
    "we have calculated the corresponding one loop radiative corrections in the on  mass  shell scheme , concentrating mainly here on a comparison between the contributions of the higgs sector in a general thdm - ii or mssm - like contexts , as well as on the model - independent soft photon contributions .",

    "@xmath56 ) as compared to the mssm .",
    "the soft photon contribution for this process is found to be substantial ( about -20% ) for moderate values of the soft  photon energy cut - off @xmath244 .",
    "if @xmath56 takes its mssm values the one - loop corrections turn out to be rather small ( a few percent ) . away from its mssm values",
    ", @xmath56 induces large effects , both for small and large tan@xmath3 .",
    "those large corrections arise from the contributions of model ",
    "dependent vertices which enter both the final state vertex and the charged higgs renormalization constant .",

    "energy .    in summary ,",
    "the radiative corrections to the charged higgs pair production in @xmath7 annihilation can be significant and should be included in any reliable analysis .",
    "furthermore , the large model - dependent effects can help discriminate phenomenologically between a ( softly broken ) supersymmetric and a non - supersymmetric minimal higgs sector , irrespective of direct evidence for the susy spectrum .",
    "the one - loop corrections of the full - fledged mssm should be eventually included .",
