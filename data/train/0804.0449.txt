    "the study of the quasione - dimensional semiconductors with the cylindrical symmetry became an urgent problem as soon as investigations of semiconducting nanotubes had been launched .",
    "one of the most important trends of research in this field is the study of optical spectra of such systems , which should include the exciton contributions  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "evidently , the quasione - dimensional large - radius exciton problem can be reduced to the 1d system of two quasi - particles with the potential having coulomb attraction tail .",
    "due to the parity of the interaction potential the exciton states should split into the odd and even series . in  @xcite",
    "we show that for the bare and screened coulomb interaction potentials the binding energy of even excitons in the ground state well exceeds the energy gap ( in the same work we also discuss the factors , which prevent the collapse of single - electron states in isolated semiconducting single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) .",
    "but the electron - hole ( e - h ) interaction potential and so the corresponding exciton binding energies may noticeably depend on the electron and hole charge distributions .",
    "so it is worth to ascertain whether the effect of seeming instability of single - electron states near the gap is inherent to the all quasione - dimensional semiconductors in vacuum or it maybe takes place only in swcnts for the specific localization of electrons ( holes ) at their surface and weak screening by the bound electrons .",
    "that is why we consider here the simplest model of the quasione - dimensional semiconductor with the cylindrical symmetry , namely the linear crystal with two atoms in the unit cell .",
    "the electrons ( holes ) in this crystal are simply localized at its axis .",
    "the aim of this work is only a qualitative analysis of the mentioned effect . for study of electron structure of concerned 1d crystal",
    "we apply here the zero - range potentials ( zrps ) method  @xcite,@xcite ( see section  2 ) .",
    "the matter is that results on the band structure and single - electron states , obtained by this method for swcnts in  @xcite,@xcite , appeared to be in good accordance with the experimental data and results of ab initio calculations related to the band states .",
    "for certainty we use the linear crystal parameters ( the electron bare mass , lattice parameters ) taken from works on nanotubes  @xcite,@xcite . in section",
    "3 we obtain the e - h bare interaction potential and that screened by the crystal band electrons , and then the large - radius exciton spectrum for the linear crystal in vacuum .",
    "all these data are used in section  4 , where we present results of calculations for the crystal with different lattice periods ( it also means different band structures ) .",
    "as it turns out , the binding energy of even excitons in the ground state well exceeds ( @xmath0 times ) the energy gap for the linear crystal in vacuum and the screening by the crystal band electrons is negligible .",
    "note , that this result was obtained within the framework of exactly solvable zrps model with feasible parameters .",
    "therefore , the mentioned instability effect may take place not only for the considered simplest case , but , most likely , also for other quasione - dimensional isolated semiconductors in vacuum .",
    "we have obtained the single - electron states in the linear crystal using the zero - range potentials ( zrps ) method  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the main point of this method is that the interaction of an electron with atoms or ions of a lattice is described instead of some periodic potential @xmath1 by the sum of fermi pseudo - potentials  @xcite @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the points of atoms location , @xmath5 is a certain fitting parameter ) or equivalently by the set of boundary conditions imposed on the single - electron wave function @xmath6 at points @xmath4 : @xmath7 the electron wave functions satisfy at that the schrdinger equation for a free particle for @xmath8 . therefore we seek them for the linear crystal in the form : @xmath9 where indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote two monatomic sublattices of the diatomic lattice , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 numbers all the sublattices points , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the electron energy and @xmath17 is the bare mass . for certainty , following  @xcite,@xcite we take from now on @xmath18 and the zrp parameter @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the ionization energy of an isolated carbon atom . by  @xcite,@xcite , with these @xmath5 and @xmath17 zrps method reproduces single - electron spectra of such quasione - dimensional structures as swcnts within an accuracy of existing experiments .",
    "one can take infinite limits for the series in  ( [ 2.1 ] ) even for the finite crystal , because terms of these series decrease exponentially with increasing of @xmath14 .    according to the zrps method the wave functions  ( [ 2.1 ] )",
    "should satisfy the following boundary conditions at the all sublattices points : @xmath21 here @xmath22 according to each sublattice .",
    "further we suppose that the linear crystal lies along the @xmath23-axis , thus @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath23-axis unit vector , @xmath27 is the distance between atoms in the unit cell of the crystal and @xmath28 is the distance between the neighbour atoms in each sublattice .",
    "note , that @xmath29 corresponds to the metallic monatomic crystal and for the case @xmath30 the smallest distance between atoms in the crystal is @xmath31 .",
    "substituting  ( [ 2.1 ] ) to  ( [ 2.2 ] ) and applying the bloch theorem ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the electron quasi - momentum ) we get two equations for amplitudes @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37\\right),\\ ] ] @xmath38 setting @xmath39 : @xmath40}{1-x^j\\exp[d({\\mathrm{i}}q-\\kappa)]}+\\frac{x^{j-2}\\exp[\\kappa a]}{\\exp[d({\\mathrm{i}}q+\\kappa)]-x^j}\\right){\\mathrm{d}}x\\ ] ] for each real @xmath41 .    from  ( [ 2.3 ] )",
    "we get two equations , which define the band structure of the crystal : @xmath42 @xmath43 equation  ( [ 2.7 ] ) defines the conduction band and equation  ( [ 2.8 ] ) defines the valence band ( see section  4 , figure  1 )",
    ". so the electron and hole effective masses can be simply obtained from  ( [ 2.7 ] ) and  ( [ 2.8 ] ) , respectively .",
    "further , using the hilbert identity for green s function of the 3d helmholtz equation , we obtain the normalized wave functions  ( [ 2.1 ] ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the crystal length and @xmath46 is the normalization factor : @xmath47 and @xmath48\\sinh{\\kappa a}+\\sinh{\\kappa[d - a]}\\right).\\ ] ]",
    "using the same arguments as in the 3d case one can show ( see , for example  @xcite ) , that the wave equation for the fourier transform @xmath49 of envelope function in the wave packet from products of the electron and hole bloch functions , which represents a two - particle state of large - radius rest exciton in a ( quasi)one - dimensional semiconductor with period @xmath50 , is reduced to the following 1d schrdinger equation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the e - h reduced effective mass and @xmath53 is the e - h interaction potential : @xmath54 here @xmath55 are the bloch amplitudes of the bloch wave functions @xmath56 of the conduction and valence band electrons of the linear crystal , respectively . using the actual localization of the bloch amplitudes at the crystal axis , after several fourier transformations and simplifications we adduce the e - h interaction potential to the following form : @xmath57+\\exp\\left[-\\frac{k}{r_1}|d+z|\\right]-2\\exp\\left[-\\frac{k}{r_1}|z|\\right]\\right){\\mathrm{d}}k , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the radius of the electron ( hole ) wave functions transverse localization @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the transverse component of the radius - vector , @xmath63 and @xmath64 correspond to the conduction and valence bands edges at the energy gap ( according to  ( [ 2.7 ] ) and  ( [ 2.8 ] ) , respectively ) .",
    "equation  ( [ 3.1 ] ) with the potential given by  ( [ 3.2 ] ) defines the spectrum of large - radius exciton in the linear , diatomic crystal if the screening effect by the crystal electrons is ignored . actually , the screening of the potential  ( [ 3.2 ] ) by the band electrons is insignificant .    indeed , following the lindhard method ( so - called rpa ) , to obtain the e - h interaction potential @xmath65 , screened by the electrons of linear lattice ,",
    "let us consider the poisson equation : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the radius - vector , @xmath68 is the density of extraneous charge and @xmath69 is the charge density induced by the extraneous charge .    by  ( [ 3.3 ] ) the screened e - h interaction potential may be written as : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is green s function of the 3d poisson equation .",

    "it appears , that @xmath99 calculated according to  ( [ 3.13 ] ) for @xmath50 varying in the interval @xmath103 $ ] are about @xmath104 .",
    "using equations  ( [ 2.7 ] ) and  ( [ 2.8 ] ) we obtained the band structure ( see figure  1 ) and the electrons and holes effective masses for the linear crystal of dimers for different values of the ratio @xmath105 of its period @xmath50 and the distance @xmath27 between atoms in dimers .",
    "besides , using wave equation  ( [ 3.1 ] ) and potentials  ( [ 3.2 ] ) and  ( [ 3.11 ] ) we found the large - radius exciton energy spectrum in the crystal for the bare e - h interaction and e - h interaction screened by the bound electrons of the crystal .",
    "we present here results for the crystal with @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "contrary to the single - band metallic crystal with @xmath107 , the crystals with @xmath41 are semiconductors with band gaps varying from zero to the difference between the electron levels in an isolated dimer . particularly , the crystals with @xmath108 and realistic values of @xmath27 and @xmath5 ( as in nanotubes and some 1d polymer chains ) are narrow - gap semiconductors , in which excitons may possess binding energies about @xmath109 , but the crystals with @xmath110 are already wide - gap ( @xmath111 ) semiconductors with strongly bound e - h pairs , and the crystals with @xmath112 are almost flat band semiconductors , but their electrons and holes at the energy gaps ( @xmath63 ) still have the finite effective masses ( these electrons and holes form the excitons in the crystals ) . for certainty , the distance @xmath27 we have chosen equal to the graphite in - plane parameter @xmath113 .",

[",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as one can see from table  1 the obtained from  ( [ 3.13 ] ) dimensionless screening parameter @xmath120 for the all considered values of @xmath121 .",
    "so , it turns out that the screening of the e - h interaction potential by the band electrons in the linear , diatomic crystal may be ignored .",
    "this result could be expected since the considered model of linear crystal is close to that of the electron gas confined to a cylindrical well . in the latter case , for which the separation of the angular variables takes place , the states with different quantum numbers @xmath122 of the angular momentum play the role of electron bands .",
    "accordingly , the matrix element @xmath123 from  ( [ 3.12 ] ) for the direct transitions between bands with different @xmath122 appears to be identically equal to zero .",
    "this is why only the binding energies of excitons with unscreened interaction potential are listed in table  1 .    to obtain estimates of the main linear crystal characteristics we considered several limiting cases . in the case of @xmath124 ( or @xmath125 ) and",
    "@xmath126 equations  ( [ 2.7 ] ) and  ( [ 2.8 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath127/a=0 $ ] , thus bands become flat ( @xmath128 do not depend on @xmath34 ) and the band gap tends to the finite value @xmath129 ( for @xmath130  nm it is about 6.3  ev ) , hence the reduced effective mass and exciton binding energy tend to infinity , while the exciton radius @xmath131 tends to zero .",
    "therefore , the large - radius exciton theory is actually appropriate ( @xmath132 ) for excitons in the linear , diatomic crystal only when its period @xmath50 runs the interval @xmath133 ( e.g. , @xmath134 is @xmath135 for @xmath110 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 ) . if @xmath138 , but @xmath139 , the conduction band moves to the region of positive energies and at some critical value of @xmath27 disappears , while the valence band shifts correspondingly to the region of deep negative energies .",
    "table  1 shows that the ground - state exciton binding energies for the linear , diatomic crystals with any value of the ratio @xmath121 are greater than the corresponding energy gaps .",
    "note , that according to the same calculations , but with the bare mass @xmath140 , the ground - state exciton binding energy for the linear crystal in vacuum appears significantly greater than the energy gap .",
    "we should note also , that the ground - state binding energies of excitons in the linear crystal with different periods @xmath50 in vacuum , calculated using the 1d analogue of the ohno potential  @xcite instead of potential  ( [ 3.2 ] ) , remain greater than the corresponding energy gaps . particularly , for @xmath141 calculations with the 1d unscreened ohno potential with the energy parameter @xmath142 taken from  @xcite ( @xmath143 ) and  @xcite ( @xmath144 ) give the ground - state exciton",
    "binding energies @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively , while @xmath147 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "thus , all calculations made on the base of solvable zero - range potentials model indicate the instability of the single - electron states in the vicinity of the energy gap with respect to the formation of excitons .",
    "this might be a shortage of this model , but it is worth mentioning that results obtained on one - particle states in real 1d systems , like swcnts  @xcite ,  @xcite , within its framework agree with existing experimental data in limits of accuracy of the latter .",
    "the stability of single - electron states of 1d semiconductors with respect to the exciton formation in vacuum can be explained by bringing multi - particle contributions into the picture . with the advent of some number of excitons in the quasione - dimensional crystal the additional screening appears , which is caused by a rather great polarizability of excitons in the longitudinal electric field .",
    "this collective contribution of born excitons into the crystal permittivity returns the lowest exciton binding energy @xmath148 into the energy gap and so blocks further spontaneous transitions to the exciton states . to show this",
    "let us consider the model of linear crystal immersed into the gas of excitons with dielectric constant @xmath149 confined to the region of linear crystal carriers transverse localization , namely : cylinder with radius @xmath59 and axis coinciding with that of linear crystal ( from now on , for estimates , we assume that electron and hole have the same transverse localization radius ) .",
    "in this case it is easy to show that the e - h interaction potential is given by : @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the modified bessel functions of the order @xmath153 of the first and second kind , respectively .",
    "further , like in  @xcite , we use the known elementary relation between the permittivity of exciton gas and its polarizability @xmath5 in the direction of linear crystal @xmath154 where @xmath14 is the bulk concentration of excitons , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are the exciton eigenfunction and binding energy , which correspond to the ground state , and @xmath157 and @xmath158 are those , which correspond to the all excited states of exciton .",
    "thus , the upper and lower limits for @xmath5 are : @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 correspond to the lowest excited exciton state .",
    "hence , one can obtain the upper and lower limits for @xmath14 : @xmath162 where each @xmath49 is the component of fourier transform of the corresponding exciton envelope function , it depends only on the distance @xmath23 between the electron and hole . at that , @xmath163 is the even solution of  ( [ 3.1 ] ) with potential  ( [ 4.1 ] ) , which corresponds to the exciton ground state and satisfies the boundary condition @xmath164 , and @xmath165 is the odd solution of the same equation , which corresponds to the lowest excited exciton state and satisfies the boundary condition @xmath166 .",
    "varying @xmath149 in  ( [ 4.1 ] ) substituted into the wave equation  ( [ 3.1 ] ) one can match @xmath148 to the forbidden band width .",
    "further , @xmath167 can be obtained from the same equation with the fixed @xmath149 and with the corresponding boundary condition .",
    "all these magnitudes allow to calculate from  ( [ 4.2 ] ) the rough upper and lower limits for the critical concentration of born excitons @xmath168 , which is sufficient to return @xmath148 into the energy gap .",
    "further , knowing @xmath168 we can calculate the shift of the forbidden band edges , which move apart due to the transformation of some single - electron states into excitons .",
    "this results in the enhancement of energy gap @xmath169 like in  @xcite and  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath170 is the linear critical concentration of excitons , and @xmath59 is the radius of electron wave functions transverse localization at the linear crystal axis .    in accordance with  ( [ 4.2 ] ) the described model yields @xmath171 ( @xmath172 of the atoms number in the crystal ) and @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) for the linear crystal with @xmath110 and @xmath175 , respectively , while by  ( [ 4.3 ] ) the corresponding @xmath176 are @xmath177 and @xmath178 in the same order . here",
    ", however , we should mention that for swcnts both the measured in  @xcite,@xcite and estimated in the same manner  @xcite values of @xmath179 appeared to be two - four times less .",
    "note , finally , that the instability of the single - electron states weakens or disappears for linear crystals immersed into dielectric media . as it was shown in  @xcite by the example of the poly - para - phenylenevinylene 1d chain or in  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite by the example of swcnts the environmental effect may substantially decrease the excitons binding energies . indeed , for the linear crystal in media even with permittivity about @xmath180 ( e.g. , like in  @xcite or  @xcite ) the ground - state exciton binding energy becomes smaller than the energy gap .",
