    "at landau level filling factor @xmath0 bilayer two - dimensional electron systems in the quantum hall regime can have broken symmetry ground states@xcite with spontaneous inter - layer phase coherence .",
    "these ordered states can be viewed as excitonic superfluids,@xcite or as xy pseudospin ferromagnets@xcite in which the pseudospin is formed from the two - valued _ which layer _ quantum degree of freedom .",
    "the most robust experimental signature of these states , a vastly enhanced inter - layer tunnel conductance@xcite at small bias voltages , is still poorly understood from a quantitative point of view .",
    "two types of ideas , which differ most essentially in how the bias voltage is introduced in the theory , have been explored in an effort to understand the height and width of the tunnel conductance peak . in one approach@xcite",
    "the bias voltage is introduced as an effective magnetic field , uniform across the bilayer , which induces pseudospin precession around the @xmath1 axis , driving the interlayer phase difference at a steady rate and inducing a purely oscillating inter - layer current . when the microscopic inter - layer tunneling amplitude is treated as a perturbation , thermal and disorder fluctuations of the condensate",
    "are then responsible for a finite _ dc _ conductance peak .",
    "we refer to this type of theory below as the weak - coupling theory of the tunneling anomaly .",
    "weak - coupling theories predict@xcite splitting of the zero voltage tunnel conductance peak into separate finite voltage peaks in the presence of a magnetic field component parallel to the two - dimensional layers , an effect that is not@xcite seen experimentally . the second type of transport theory@xcite is formulated in terms of local chemical potentials of fermionic quasiparticles which may be altered by the ordered state condensate but are still responsible for charge conduction . in this type of theory",
    "the tunnel conductance is finite even in the absence of disorder and thermal fluctuations because charge has to be driven between normal - metal source and drain contacts .",
    "the resistance generally depends@xcite on how the fermionic degrees of freedom which carry charge between leads are influenced by order parameter and disorder configurations and can not be described in terms of condensate dynamics alone . in the second approach the width in voltage of the conductance peak",
    "is simply equal to the product of this resistance and the maximum current between source and drain at which the order parameter can maintain a time - independent steady - state value .    in this article",
    "we expand on the second type of theory of the conductance peak , using pseudospin - transfer torque ideas@xcite borrowed from recent ferromagnetic - metal spintronics literature to model the influence of the transport current on the pseudospin magnetization .",
    "we find that the critical current depends in general on details of the sample geometry and on how disorder and localization physics influence transport inside the system .",
    "generally speaking however , the critical current is proportional to system area and to the inter - layer tunneling amplitude when the condensate s josephson length is larger than the system perimeter , and proportional to the system perimeter and to the square root of the inter - layer tunneling amplitude when it is shorter .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the pseudospin - transfer torque theory of order - parameter dynamics in a bilayer quantum hall ferromagnet .",
    "we use this theory in section iii to discuss critical current values from a qualitative point of view . in section",
    "iv we report on a series of numerical studies which take into account the two - dimensional nature of the systems of interest and the edge dominated current - paths typical of strong magnetic fields .",
    "the pseudospin transfer torque theory enables us to assess the influence of sample geometry on critical currents . finally in section",
    "v we discuss the significance of our findings in relation to recent experiments .",
    "we find that experimental critical currents are several orders of magnitude smaller than theoretical ones and argue that vortex - like disorder - induced pseudospin textures must be largely responsible for this discrepancy .",
    "we propose new experimental studies which can test our ideas and thereby achieve progress toward a quantitative theory of the spontaneous coherence tunneling anomaly .",
    "in the lattice model@xcite of @xmath0 bilayer systems , the local _ which _ layer degree of freedom can be expressed as a pseudospin defined by the operator @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the site index , @xmath4 is the layer index and @xmath5 is the pauli matrix vector .",
    "the pseudospin hamiltonian has the form@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the direct coulomb interaction associated with the @xmath8 pseudospin component ( _ i.e. _ with charge transfer between layers ) , @xmath9 , is the exchange interaction between orbitals in the same layer and @xmath10 is the exchange interaction between orbitals located in different layers .",
    "since @xmath11 is generally larger than @xmath12 , the classical ground state is an easy - plane pseudospin ferromagnet with a hard @xmath8 axis . in the limit of smooth textures",
    "the pseudospin energy functional has the form @xcite @xmath13 & = & \\int d^2 r   \\left\\ { \\beta \\ , ( m_z)^2 \\right .",

    "the parameters which appear in this expression are the anisotropy parameter @xmath15 , the pseudospin stiffness ( or equivalently the exciton superfluid density ) @xmath16 , the splitting between symmetric and antisymmetric single - particle bilayer states due to interlayer tunneling @xmath17 , and the pseudospin density @xmath18 .",
    "the mean - field - theory pseudospin ferromagnet@xcite consists of a full landau level of electrons in identical phase coherent bilayer states .",
    "it follows that the mean - field - theory pseudospin density @xmath18 is equal to the full landau level density , @xmath19 .",

    "the values of these three parameters are modified@xcite by quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "the fourth parameter @xmath17 is exponentially sensitive to the tunnel barrier between layers .",
    "parameters values can also be influenced by disorder on length scales shorter than those on which this coarse - grained continuum theory is applied ; disorder on longer length scales would have to be treated explicitly as we mention in the discussion section .",
    "the upshot is that the numerical values of the parameters in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : engfunctional ] ) are usually not accurately known and likely vary substantially from sample to sample .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath18 must vanish at finite temperatures when @xmath24 since two - dimensional systems can not support spontaneous long - range phase order . among all continuum model parameters",
    "the value of @xmath22 , which is typically @xmath25 , is likely the most reliably known .",
    "since the _ which layer _ pseudospin and the true electron spin have identical quantum mechanical descriptions , we can borrow from the ferromagnetic metal spintronics literature@xcite and use the landau - lifshitz - slonczewski(lls ) equation to describe how the semiclassical pseudospin dynamics is influenced by a transport current : @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the number current density for electrons . ) the second term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "(  [ eq : llscompact ] ) captures the transport current effect .",
    "its role in these equations is similar to the role played by the leads in the pioneering analysis of coherent bilayer tunneling by wen and zee@xcite who argued that a term should be added to the global condensate equation of motion to account for the contribution of transport currents to the difference in population between top and bottom layers .",
    "eq . (  [ eq : llscompact ] ) describes how a transport current alters the condensate equation of motion locally .",

    "the third term accounts for damping of the collective motion due to coupling to its environment , in the present case the fermi sea of quasiparticles .",
    "the damping term in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : llscompact ] ) has the standard isotropic form used in the magnetism literature .",
    "a microscopic theory@xcite of damping in quantum hall bilayers makes it clear that the damping is actually quite anisotropic .",
    "we return to this point below .",
    "magnetic order in the metallic ferromagnets to which this equation is normally applied is extremely robust , justifying the assumption that the spin - density magnitude is essentially unchanged even when the system is driven from equilibrium by a transport current .",
    "the only relevant degree of freedom is the spin - density direction , whose dynamics is described by eq .",
    "(  [ eq : llscompact ] ) .",
    "we expect that the pseudospin transfer torque description of bilayer quantum hall systems will be most reliable when the order is most firmly established , that is far away from the phase boundary@xcite that separates ordered and disordered states .",
    "the transport - current ( slonczewski@xcite ) term in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : llscompact ] ) can be understood in several different ways . in the spintronics literature",
    "this term is normally motivated by an appeal to total spin conservation and referred to as the spin - transfer torque .",
    "the idea is that when a ferromagnet s spin - polarized quasiparticles carry a transport current through a spatial region with a non - collinear magnetization , they violate spin - conservation . the collective magnetization must therefore compensate by rotating at a constant rate which is proportional to the fermion drift velocity .",
    "the form we use for the pseudospin transfer torque assumes that each component of the pseudospin current is locally equal to the number current times the corresponding pseudospin direction cosine .",
    "this property does not hold locally in a microscopic theory , but is expected to be valid in the smooth pseudospin texture limit we address .",
    "( in metals an additional phenomenological factor is required to account for the difference in drift velocity between majority and minority spin electrons . )    since pseudospin is not conserved in bilayer quantum hall systems , as we can see from eq .",
    "(  [ eq : englattice ] ) or eq .",
    "(  [ eq : engfunctional ] ) , this argument does not apply directly .",
    "if we appeal to a mean - field description of the pseudospin ferromagnet , however , we can obtain the same result by the following argument .",
    "mean - field quasiparticles satisfy a single - particle hamiltonian for a particle in a magnetic field which experiences both a scalar potential , and a pseudospin - dependent potential that can be interpreted as a pseudospin effective magnetic field . following standard textbook derivations it is possible@xcite to derive an expression for the time - dependence of the contribution of a single quasiparticle to any component of the pseudospin density .",
    "the expression contains a pseudospin precession term and an additional term which is the divergence of the current of that component of pseudospin . summing over all quasiparticle states we obtain a precession term that depends on the configuration of the order parameter , and hence on the pseudospin - field to which it gives rise , even in the absence of a current .",
    "we obtain the additional current - driven term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "(  [ eq : llscompact ] ) when the pseudospin currents are non - zero and space dependent .",
    "the additional term in the equation of motion can also be viewed@xcite as a consequence of an altered relationship between pseudospin - dependent effective magnetic field and pseudospin polarization direction for quasiparticles that carry a current .",
    "(  [ eq : llscompact ] ) should in principle also include a current related damping term@xcite which we ignore in the present paper .    when quantum hall bilayer pseudospin ferromagnets are tilted far from their easy plane , order tends@xcite to be destroyed . for that reason we are often most interested in the limit",
    "in which @xmath29 is much less than @xmath30 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to express the pseudospin direction in terms of the azimuthal angle @xmath31 , which is the inter - layer phase difference , and @xmath29 which is proportional to the layer polarization . in terms of these variables",
    "the lls equations take the form @xmath32 in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : lls ] ) we have written @xmath33 , which has units of velocity , as the pseudospin velocity @xmath34 .    these equations",
    "do not on their own provide a closed description of pseudospin dynamics in the presence of electrical bias potentials and need to be supplemented by a theory which specifies the spatial dependence of the pseudospin current .",
    "in general this quantity depends@xcite on the order parameter configuration as well as on the contact geometry and external current or voltage biases . the transport theory and the pseudospin dynamics theory are therefore not independent . in the present paper we study",
    "voltage biased hall bars with source and drain leads at opposite ends , and with a variety of shapes and sizes .",
    "we assume , as a simplification , that the current distribution is defined by a local conductivity tensor with a large hall angle . given these simplifications , we are able to explicitly evaluate the maximum current at which time - independent order parameters are possible . because collective tunneling no longer contributes strongly to the _ dc _ interlayer current",
    "when the inter - layer phase is time - dependent , the interlayer conductance mechanism changes qualitatively when this maximum current is exceeded .",
    "we therefore associate this current with the experimental critical current .",
    "in this section we discuss approximate upper bounds on the critical current which are helpful in interpreting the numerical results described in the following section .",
    "we use a simplified version of the static limit of the @xmath35 lls equation ( eq .",
    "(  [ eq : lls ] ) ) in which @xmath29 is assumed to be small : @xmath36 the three terms on the right - hand side can be identified as contributions to the time - dependence of @xmath29 ( or equivalently of the exciton density ) due respectively to the divergence of the exciton supercurrent , coherent condensate tunneling , and the divergence of the @xmath8 ( layer antisymmetric or counterflow ) fermionic pseudospin current .",
    "the last contribution would be viewed as a spin - transfer torque in the analogous equations for an easy - plane anisotropy ferromagnetic metal .     quantum hall effect . at large hall angles",
    "current enters and leaves the samples at the _ hot spot _ corners , even when the source and drain contacts ( gray ) fully cover the ends of a hall bar .",
    "when order is well established , the pseudospin orientation of the transport electrons achieves alignment with the condensate within a relatively small fraction of the sample area close to source and drain ( solid yellow ) . in these areas",
    "pseudospin transfer torques convert transport currents into condensate counterflow supercurrents .",
    "when source and drain are connected to opposite layers a net supercurrent is injected into the interior region of the sample . in the remaining sample area ( shaded blue )",
    "collective interlayer tunneling can act as a sink for the counterflow supercurrent . ]",
    "we start our qualitative discussion of critical currents by identifying some relevant length scales .",
    "first the length scale , @xmath37 often referred to as the josephson length because of the similarity between these equations and those which describe josephson junctions , emerges from balancing the first and second terms . in this paper",
    "we assume that the pseudospin magnetization direction departs from the @xmath38 plane only over a small region close to the source and drain contacts whose spatial extent is small compared to the josephson length .",
    "( this issue is addressed again in the discussion section . ) if this is correct , we can separate length scales by identifying a region close to the contact which is small enough that we can ignore coherent tunneling by setting @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and large enough that we can assume that @xmath29 is close to zero in the rest of the system .",
    "( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : mz ] ) . )",
    "when @xmath41 , eq .",
    "(  [ eq : steadystate ] ) simply expresses the conservation of the sum of the excitonic and quasiparticle counterflow currents .",
    "integration of eq .",
    "(  [ eq : steadystate ] ) over the area close to the contact then simply describes conversion of quasiparticle counterflow current into condensate counterflow current .",
    "the total counterflow current emerging from the area near the source contact is half of the total current flowing into the system since @xmath42 in the contact and @xmath43 far away from the contact . in a tunnel geometry experiment",
    "the same counterflow current is generated near the source and drain contacts located at opposite dies of the sample , so the total counterflow supercurrent injected _ into _ the system is equal to the total number current flowing _ through _ the system .    with this separation of length",
    "scales the quasiparticle ( pseudospin transfer torque ) term can be dropped in the remaining portion @xmath44 of the total system area @xmath45 . for static solutions of the lls equations the condensate must satisfy an elliptic sine - gordon equation inside @xmath44 : @xmath46 when @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , this equation states that @xmath49 is zero .",
    "it then follows from green s theorem that no net counterflow supercurrent can flow into the area @xmath44 . in the tunnel geometry that means that time - independent order parameter values can not be maintained in the presence of a transport current unless @xmath50 .",
    "the maximum tunneling current that can flow through the system is particularly simple to determine in the small @xmath39 , large @xmath51 limit .",
    "when @xmath51 is much larger than the system size the angle @xmath31 can not vary substantially over the system area . with this simplification the elliptic sine - gordon equation",
    "can be integrated over the area @xmath44 to obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the perimeter of @xmath44 and @xmath54 is proportional to the outward normal .",
    "the left hand side of eq .",
    "(  [ smallcritcurrent ] ) is the net supercurrent which flows out of the region @xmath44 from its boundaries near the source and drain contacts , identified above as the number current flowing through the system .",
    "since the maximum value of @xmath55 is @xmath30 , it follows that the maximum current consistent with a time - independent order parameter in this case is @xmath56 since the critical current in the small @xmath39 limit is proportional to the area of the system we will refer to this quantity as the bulk critical current , as suggested by the notation used above .    for larger @xmath39 , @xmath51 is no longer larger than the system size and it is not possible to maintain the maximum value of @xmath57 across the system .",
    "the lls equation critical current in this regime depends on geometric details and we have not been able to obtain rigorous bounds .",
    "we can make a rough estimate by following an argument along the following lines .",
    "the elliptic sine - gordon equation is very similar to the regular sine - gordon equation in which second order derivatives with respect to time and position appear with opposite signs .",
    "this 1 + 1 dimensional sine - gordon equation appears as the euler - lagrange equation of motion of a system with a lagrangian with a kinetic - energy term proportional to @xmath58 and a potential energy term proportional @xmath59 .",
    "since total energy ( integrated over position @xmath60 ) is conserved by this dynamics it follows that the variation of the typical value of @xmath61 along the space - time boundary can not be larger than @xmath62 .",
    "when this energy conservation condition is mapped from the regular sine - gordon equation to the ( imaginary time ) elliptic sine - gordon equation we can conclude that the typical value of @xmath63 along the boundary of @xmath44 near the source contact can not differ from the typical value of @xmath63 along the boundary near the drain contact by more than @xmath62 .",
    "it follows that the current flowing through the system from source to drain should not be much larger than @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the length of the contract region , or the width of a hall bar assumed to be contacted at its edges .",
    "we will refer to @xmath66 as the edge critical current , since it is limited by the length of one edge . for stronger interlayer coupling then critical current",
    "is expected to vary as @xmath67 once @xmath51 is smaller than the hall bar length .",
    "finally we note that because of hot - spot effects in transport with large hall angles the pseudospin transfer torque will act at the sample corners .",
    "since the supercurrent is converted into coherent pseudospin precession over the length scale @xmath51 , the effective size of the contact region will be @xmath68 when the hall angle is large and @xmath51 is smaller than @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore estimate that the critical current is close to @xmath69 independent of @xmath39 , under these circumstances .",
    "we refer to this last critical current as the corner critical current . in the following section we compare numerical lls critical currents with these rough estimates .",
    "the numerical calculations we describe below are similar to those carried out in micromagnetic descriptions of ferromagnetic metal spin - transfer torque physics , but are applied here to pseudospin transfer physics in condensed bilayers .",
    "we divide the system area into pixels within which the pseudospin magnetization is assumed to be constant . except where noted we used square @xmath70 pixels where @xmath71 is the magnetic length .",

    "given the source and drain contact voltages , we can solve for the internal voltage and current distributions and for the variation of source and drain currents across the contacts .",
    "note that quantum hall physics comes into play through the hall contributions to the conductivity matrix @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the local hall conductivity was set to @xmath81 , which is close to the appropriate value for @xmath0 whether or not the hall plateau is fully formed , and the longitudinal conductivity was set to @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the magnetization orientation to the left and right of a boundary separating two - pixels .",
    "the hall angle used in these calculations was therefore @xmath84 over the largest part of the sample in which the pseudospin magnetization is close to collinear and planar .",
    "the results we report on are not sensitive to the hall angle , provided that it is large . the current which flows into a pixel",
    "is assumed to have the same pseudospin polarization as the pixel from which it is incident .",
    "currents entering or exiting from the contacts are assumed to have @xmath85 for top layer contacts and @xmath86 for bottom layer contacts . in this way the pseudospin transfer torque and the landau - lifshitz precessional torque acting on each pixel s pseudospin can be evaluated .",
    "note that the pseudospin torque depends not only on current paths , but also on the pseudospin magnetization configuration .      as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "we identify the critical current as the circuit current value above which a time independent solution no longer exists .",
    "when the external current is small , the gilbert damping term in the lls equation relaxes the pseudospin magnetization into time - independent configurations .",
    "the behavior of the pseudospin as the current increases is partly analogous to the behavior of a damped pendulum driven by an increasingly strong torque .",

    "the most essential difference between tunneling in coherent quantum hall bilayers and josephson junctions lies in the difference in physical content between the bias currents @xmath147 and @xmath152 . in the case of a josephson junction",
    "it is a bulk dissipationless supercurrent which flows perpendicular to the plane of the junction . in the case of a coherent quantum hall bilayer , it is the counterflow ( @xmath8 ) component of the quasiparticle current .",
    "the counterflow component of the quasiparticle current is normally fully converted to condensate counterflow supercurrents by pseudospin transfer torques , as we have discussed at length .",
    "the voltage drop across a josephson junction can be measured and vanishes below the critical current .",
    "because fermionic quasiparticle transport , transverse counterflow supercurrents , and collective interlayer tunneling are unavoidably intertwined in the coherent bilayer tunneling case , there is no corresponding measurable voltage which vanishes below the critical current . instead",

    "this corresponds to a critical current in the @xmath155 regime , orders of magnitude larger than the current levels typically employed in quantum hall experiments . even accounting for possible corrections due to disorder , local critical currents are unlikely to be approached experimentally for either contact geometry .",
    "( if they were , we would expect more similarity between the two experiments . ) the critical currents which are important for typical tunneling experiments are not local critical currents , but global critical currents which set an upper limit on the rate at which injected supercurrent can be sunk by collective tunneling . since there is",
    "no net injected supercurrent in the drag geometry experiment , only local limits apply . in the tunnel - geometry experiment ,",
    "the global limit must be satisfied , setting a critical current scale which can be orders of magnitude smaller if @xmath17 is small .",
    "although the relationship anticipated here between tunneling geometry and drag geometry transport has not been specifically tested experimentally , it appears to us that it is clearly consistent with published data .",

    "therein lies the rub . although values for @xmath161 on this scale do imply josephson lengths that are on the @xmath162 length scale and therefore consistent with bulk - limited critical currents in the samples studied by tiemann",
    ", they are four or more orders of magnitude smaller than values expected on the basis of theoretical estimates .",
    "suspicion that there is a fundamental discrepancy is established more convincingly , perhaps , by observing that these critical currents also correspond to @xmath161 values several orders of magnitude smaller than seemingly reliable experimental estimates@xcite based on the inter - layer tunneling conductance in similar samples at zero - field .",
    "the key issue then in comparing critical current theories with experiment appears to be explaining why they are so small .",
    "we expect on general grounds that the experimental value of @xmath163 should be renormalized downward by both thermal and quantum fluctuations and by disorder . indeed according to the familiar mermin - wagner theorem",
    ", the order parameter @xmath18 must vanish for @xmath24 at finite temperatures .",
    "the importance of thermal fluctuations is strongly influenced by @xmath164 .",
    "if mean - field theory estimates@xcite of @xmath22 can be trusted , the value of @xmath22 in typical experimental samples should be @xmath165 and @xmath164 should therefore be less than @xmath166 at the lowest measurement temperatures . at these low temperatures",
    "thermal fluctuations alone appear to be insufficient@xcite to explain the discrepancy even though @xmath167 is certainly small .",
    "the experimental finding that the critical current saturates at low temperatures supports this conclusion .",
    "similarly , theoretical estimates that quantum fluctuation corrections to the order parameter are not@xcite large well away from the transition boundary are consistent with the experimental finding of saturating critical currents in this regime .",
    "it appears that an explanation for the small critical currents must be found in the disorder physics of quantum hall superfluids .",
    "the analysis of tunneling critical currents presented in this paper can accommodate disorder implicitly through its influence on the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath39 .",
    "including disorder effects through renormalized coupling constants would be adequate if the characteristic length scales for disorder physics are smaller than characteristic length scales like @xmath51 which are relevant for pseudospin transfer torques . in quantum hall superfluids disorder",
    "may play a more essential role by nucleating charged merons@xcite ( vortices ) .",
    "as we have explained , provided that the pseudospin transfer torque acts only close to the source and drain , the critical current is proportional to the integral of @xmath39 over the area of the sample .",
    "this integral is reduced to zero by a single undistorted meron located at the center of a large sample .",
    "it has in fact often@xcite been recognized that disorder induced vortices might play an essential role in many of the transport anomalies associated with bilayer coherence .",
    "it seems likely to us that this type of physics is very likely responsible for the small critical currents seen in experiment , but that existing theory is unable to account for this effect quantitatively .",
    "the current status of the subject calls for a detailed analysis of how they influence critical currents . on the experimental side ,",
    "the importance of complex disorder - related pseudospin textures for critical current values could be reduced and the essential physics which limits critical currents revealed more clearly by studying samples with much larger bare values of @xmath17 .    although we have attributed the substantial quantitative disagreement between pseudospin transfer torque theory and experiment to disorder - induced pseudospin textures and",
    "have suggested a strategy for achieving more quantitative tests of our theory , it is appropriate to step - back and reconsider other theoretical pictures that might be relevant to coherent bilayer tunneling experiments under some circumstances .",
    "for example , the version of the pseudospin - transfer torque theory applied here is based on the simplest possible assumption for the local pseudospin - polarization of the transport current , namely that the pseudospin current polarization simply follows the pseudospin density polarization .",
    "this assumption is certainly not generically correct , but its replacement requires more detailed knowledge of fermionic quasiparticle transport behavior .",
    "one approach is to assume that the quantum hall effect establishes edge state transport and use experimental voltage probe data to infer@xcite the length scale on which the pseudospin polarization of injected electrons is relaxed , and therefore the length scale over which the pseudospin transfer torque acts .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that experimental data could be used to obtain the spatial distribution of pseudospin transfer torques .",
    "examination of coherent bilayer transport data suggests@xcite that the torques sometimes act along most of the perimeter of the system , as assumed in a previous@xcite attempt to understand coherent - bilayer tunneling data , and sometimes close to the source and drain the contacts as assumed here .",
    "the current model is most appropriate well away from the coherent state phase boundary as we have discussed .",
    "the present version of the pseudospin transport torque theory does not account for thermal or quantum fluctuations of the condensate , which are unimportant in metallic ferromagnets but might sometimes be important in coherent bilayers .",
    "weak - coupling theories@xcite of bilayer tunneling do account for fluctuations , but treat @xmath17 perturbatively .",
    "these theories can not account for the existence of a critical currents and in practice assume that each layer has a separate well - defined local chemical potential .",
    "it is clear from published transport data that this assumption is not always valid , in particular that it is not valid in the portion of the phase diagram far away from the phase boundary on which the present paper focuses .",
    "experimentally@xcite the critical current value decreases as the phase boundary of the coherent state is approached by increasing either temperature or the effective layer separation @xmath168 .",
    "it would be interesting to attempt quantitative tests of the predictions of weak - coupling theories in the portion of the phase diagram close to the phase boundary .",
