    "<S> the zeeman - split spin - states of a single electron confined in a self - assembled quantum dot provide an optically - accessible spin qubit . for iii - v materials the nuclear spins of the solid - state host provide an intrinsic noise source , resulting in electron - spin dephasing times of few nanoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> while a comprehensive study of electron - spin dynamics at low magnetic field has recently been carried out , what limits the electron coherence in these systems remains unclear , in part due to the dominant effect of measurement - induced dynamic polarisation of the nuclear bath . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an all - optical method to access the quantum dot spin - state without perturbing the nuclear environment . </S>",
    "<S> we use this method to implement hahn - echo decoupling and reach the intrinsic limit to coherence set by inhomogeneous strain fields coupling to quadrupolar moments of the nuclear bath . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the extension of electron spin coherence beyond this few - microsecond limit necessitates the reduction of strain - induced quadrupolar broadening in these materials .    </S>",
    "<S> indium - gallium - arsenide ( ingaas ) quantum dots possess strong , coherent optical transitions [ 1 ] , enabling ultrafast all - optical control of the spin ground states [ 2 ] and their entanglement with single photon states [ 3 - 5 ] , key building blocks for networked quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> implementing quantum information schemes beyond elementary protocols will place stringent demands on the retention of spin coherences . </S>",
    "<S> decoupling techniques , such as hahn - echo and higher - order multi - pulse protocols , extend coherence times by filtering the effects of correlated noise [ 6,7 ] . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the coherence of solid - state spin - qubit realisations such as the nitrogen - vacancy centre in diamond and phosphorus donors in silicon has been found to be limited by the spin diffusion of a small number of environmental nuclei [ 8,9 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , electrons confined to self - assembled ingaas quantum dots experience a particularly rich nuclear environment : the electron couples via the contact hyperfine interaction to a dense bath of @xmath0 nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> hahn - echo decoupling has been used to recover spin coherence in self - assembled quantum dots for times up to 2.6 @xmath1 [ 10,11,12 ] , however a full explanation of the loss of coherence has been lacking . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the intrinsic processes limiting coherence is essential to exploiting the highly desirable optical properties of these structures .    </S>",
    "<S> self - assembled quantum dots typically form by strain - driven nucleation during epitaxial growth , resulting in inhomogeneous electric field gradients within the crystal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> another source of local field gradients is the random alloying of atomic species in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear spins in the quantum dot couple to these gradients via quadrupolar moments , resulting in spatially - dependent shifts of their energy levels [ 13,14 ] . in this </S>",
    "<S> way strain isolates individual nuclear spins such that the bath remains coherent longer than for unstrained systems [ 15 ] and maintains polarisation for multiple hours [ 16 ] . at the same time , the interaction between the electron spin and the strained bath presents unique challenges , namely the non - linear measurement - induced back - action of nuclei , often observed as the dragging of resonance frequencies by detuning resonant optical probes [ 17 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this process affects both the evolution of electron spin states and the detuning of resonant spin - readout probes to the extent that it can limit state retrieval and mask the mechanisms influencing the electron - spin dynamics [ 18 ] .     </S>",

    "<S> all data sets show a striking departure from the expected sinusoidal beating associated with the precession of the electron spin . </S>",
    "<S> when probing the spin - down projection ( iii & iv ) , a hysteretic saw - tooth behaviour emerges [ 18 ] , whilst for probing spin - up projection ( i & ii ) the readout signal is suppressed for delays beyond 200 ps . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour emerges from dynamic polarisation of the nuclear spins due to resonant driving of the optical transitions , producing a feedback loop between bath polarisation and the measured electron state [ 5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a , it is the ground - state electron projection of the readout transition which dictates the feedback dynamics we observe , consistent with mechanisms based on the non - collinear hyperfine interaction [ 28 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of this state - dependent polarisation is to frustrate time - averaged measurements of the electron - nuclear system and to prevent access to the full timescale of spin coherence . in order to inhibit the electron - state dependent polarisation of the nuclear bath , we repeat the same measurement as in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 2b . the two resulting measurements presented in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the symmetric , gaussian - amplitude decay with @xmath19 = 1.93(3 ) ns is testament to the large amplitude , yet quasi - static environmental noise , consistent with an overhauser field standard deviation of 33 mt [ 3,27 ] ( see supplementary ) .    </S>",
    "<S> having successfully decoupled nuclear bath polarisation from our resonant optical spin readout , we implement a hahn - echo scheme to assess the extent to which we can protect electron - spin coherence . </S>",

    "<S> 3a for a 91.2-ns delay between the @xmath18/2-rotations , in which the central @xmath18-rotation refocuses the dephased spin state . </S>",
    "<S> we sweep the central rotation by @xmath20 and record the visibility of the oscillatory readout signal [ 10 ] . in the limit of perfect rotations the visibility is a direct measure of the coherence of the spin state . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3b displays the integrated readout from the pulse sequence in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a , which emerges only after having decoupled the readout from bath polarisation as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( see supplementary ) . the two traces in fig . 3b </S>",
    "<S> correspond to the echo signal with ( blue circles ) and without ( orange circles ) initial inversions .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3c shows the visibilities we recover when varying storage time , t , up to 1.3 @xmath21s for four different external magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the refocussing pulse filters the quasi - static noise components that resulted in the 2-ns time - averaged dephasing , yet the electron state is still susceptible to high - frequency dynamics of the overhauser field . </S>",
    "<S> the first points of interest in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c are the collapse of coherence beyond 13 ns at low field ( 2 t ) and the damped oscillatory behaviour at short times for higher fields . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are principally due to the linearly coupled overhauser field components along the electron - spin quantisation direction . </S>",
    "<S> the linearly coupled terms arise from the tilt between the effective quadrupolar field axis and the external field . </S>",
    "<S> the large strain in these samples results in a quadrupolar coupling strength equivalent to @xmath22-t magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we only observe spin coherence beyond @xmath23 ns at relatively high external fields ( @xmath24 2 t ) as the zeeman interaction starts to dominate nuclear dynamics , reducing linearly coupled overhauser field components . in the presence of high - frequency noise , hahn echo becomes a sensitive spectroscopic tool , evidenced by the oscillatory visibility at short storage times and high external fields . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to determine the spectral composition of the nuclear bath at these frequencies by viewing the echo sequence as a filter of the overhauser field noise spectrum .        </S>",
    "<S> the power spectral densities for both the linearly coupled and transverse quadratically coupled noise components are plotted in the left and right panels of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3d . </S>",
    "<S> these are calculated from the quadrupolar and zeeman hamiltonians for the four relevant atomic species , ga@xmath25 , ga@xmath26 , as@xmath27 and in@xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the broad structures result from integrating over a gaussian distribution of quadrupolar energies and orientations , corresponding to the inhomogeneous spread of electric field gradients ( see supplementary ) . </S>",
    "<S> our choice of parameters is based on an indium concentration of 0.5 with strain profiles motivated by atomistic calculations [ 29 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the curves in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c are the calculated electron hahn - echo visibilities resulting from such noise spectra . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the power spectrum amplitude to our echo modulation is consistent with an overhauser field standard deviation of 28 - 40 mt . by decomposing the spectra into the constituent atomic species </S>",
    "<S> ( see supplementary ) we find that indium plays the dominant role in the dephasing of the electron , owing to its large nuclear spin , whilst the gallium isotopes have a negligible effect . for electrostatically confined iii - v quantum dots , hahn - echo coherence has been observed to follow an exp@xmath29 $ ] behaviour [ 22 ] , which is predicted to emerge from the dipolar coupling between nuclear spins [ 30 ] . in contrast , the coherence we observe decays exponentially at high fields ( @xmath30 3 t ) and long times ( t @xmath24 200 ns ) , at a field - dependent rate extending to 1.7 @xmath21s at 5 t. this decay stems from the quadratically coupled perpendicular overhauser field components , plotted in the right panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3d . </S>",
    "<S> these feature a broad low - frequency shoulder due to the inhomogeneous quadrupolar spread , responsible for the long - time loss of coherence . </S>",
    "<S> the perpendicular components couple to the electron splitting with a @xmath31 dependence , which reduces the effective amplitude at higher fields . indeed , further data taken for a different quantum dot at a higher external field ( 7 t ) shows coherence times extending to 2.7 @xmath21s ( see supplementary ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism provides a faster source of dephasing than theoretical predictions for coherence limited by nuclear - spin diffusion in these materials [ 30 ] , which should extend beyond 6 @xmath21s . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the quadrupolar inhomogeneity is a source of uncorrelated noise , resulting in the characteristic exponential decay of electronic coherence .    by inhibiting dynamic nuclear spin polarisation during resonant optical access to spn states </S>",
    "<S> , we observe the quadrupolar interaction of the nuclear bath with inhomogeneous electric field gradients providing an intrinsic bound to spin coherence in ingaas quantum dots . in other systems , such as electrostatically confined gaas quantum dots , multi - pulse decoupling schemes can be used to further prolong the spin coherence beyond hahn - echo limits . </S>",
    "<S> such schemes rely on noise being correlated at least on the order of the pulse separation times [ 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the broadband nature of the quadrupole - coupled nuclear dynamics , however , decorrelates the electron splitting in @xmath320 ns . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , only pulses spaced on or closer than this timescale could extend spin coherence in these systems . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the strain that is necessary for the formation of the quantum dot provides the intrinsic source of dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> we note , using a single heavy - hole as an alternative quantum - dot spin qubit should allow for longer dephasing times due to a much weaker hyperfine interaction , although other mechanisms can limit its coherence [ 31 ] . </S>",
    "<S> longer coherence times for electron spin qubits could be realised either for systems without quadrupolar nuclear moments , as in ii - vi quantum dots , or through strain - free growth methods . </S>",
    "<S> one particular example of the latter is provided by optically active gaas / algaas quantum dots grown by droplet epitaxy . with over two orders of magnitude weaker local strain than the quantum dots used here , significantly different nuclear dynamics </S>",
    "<S> have been reported [ 32 ] . with reduced quadrupolar broadening absolute coherence times that are competitive with other spin qubit realisations </S>",
    "<S> could be achieved , whilst still maintaining the ultrafast control rates and optical integration the material properties enable .    </S>",
