    ", there was a plausible , complete accounting of matter and energy in the universe .",
    "expressed as a fraction of the critical density there are : neutrinos , between 0.3% and 15% ; stars , 0.5% ; baryons ( total ) , 5% ; matter ( total ) , 40% ; smooth , dark energy , 60% ; adding up to the critical density .",
    "this accounting is consistent with the inflationary prediction of a flat universe and defines three dark - matter problems : where are the dark baryons ? what is the nonbaryonic dark matter ? what is the nature of the dark energy ?",
    "the leading candidate for the ( optically ) dark baryons is diffuse hot gas ; the leading candidates for the nonbaryonic dark matter were slowly moving elementary particles left over from the earliest moments ( cold dark matter ) , such as axions or neutralinos ; the leading candidates for the dark energy involve fundamental physics and include a cosmological constant ( vacuum energy ) , a rolling scalar field ( quintessence ) , and light , frustrated topological defects .    gooding ( 1992 )",
    "considered a universe in which density fluctuations are produced in an initally smooth universe by the ordering dynamics of scalar fields following a symmetry breaking phase transition at the grand unified scale .",
    "such transitions lead to the formation of an unstable topological defect known as  global texture . \"",

    "caldwell ( 1999 astro - ph 8168 ) remarks that most observations are consistent with models right up to the w = 1 or cosmological constant limit , and so it is natural to ask what lies on the other side at w @xmath0 1 .",
    "he termed this phantom energy .    in this paper",
    "we outline how a dark energy program will constrain these elements and , in particular , how they affect the measurement of the hubble constant by means of the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "section 2 extends the friedmann equation ; @xmath43 shows that supernova data are currently tolerant of small values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; @xmath44 explores the degeneracies in cmb data ; @xmath45 examines how matter density experiments like 2df ( peacock 2001 ) are affected ; @xmath46 broadly explores the parameter space of @xmath7 as it applies to sn and cmb data .",
    "our conclusions are in the final section .",
    "an observer confronted with data like that in figure 1 might respond by fitting a polynomial to the expansion rate as a function of redshift .",
    "but a physical equation already exists , namely the friedmann equation .",
    "@xmath8    from the point of view of fitting the data the observer might be surprised at the emphasis placed by physics on the higher order coefficients .",
    "this was not rectified until the discovery of dark energy , based on earlier versions of figure 1 by the high z supernova and supernova cosmology teams , although the zeroth order coefficient was considered and discarded by einstein .    according to gooding ( 1992 )",
    "the textures source term is    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a time constant equal to @xmath11 and the scale factor , a , is taken to be unity at the equality of matter and radiation .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the density and pressure of textures respectively .",

    "we can derive similar constraints on @xmath7 generally by requiring that the acoustic scale and shift parameter , r , ( komatsu 2011 ) are conserved .",
    "we also invoke equation ( 3 ) . for small values of the textures and curvature contributions , writing @xmath27 and a similar expression for the acoustic scale ,    @xmath28 where , but is also correct when the exact density dependence of the sound horizon , @xmath29 , and cmb redshift , @xmath30 , is included . ]",

    "we confirm what we found in section 4 , that the hubble constant and the density of matter do not constrain these parameters .",
