    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are late stages in stellar evolution , occurring for stars with mass in the range 1  6.5(@xcite ) , possibly with the upper limit at @xmath2 . most of the difficulty in understanding such stages that lead to pne is associated with the determination of the pn distance and its progenitor mass . *",
    "probably , the largest source of error is the distance which , in most cases , is known with a @xmath3 uncertainty ( e.g. @xcite ) , or more .",
    "however , both problems can be minimised if the pn is physically associated with a star cluster .",
    "star cluster distances , in general , can be determined with a high precision and , in the case of physical association , the pn progenitor mass can be assumed to be @xmath4 larger than that of the turnoff ( to ) , stars referred to by @xcite as red - turnoff objects .",
    "exceptions are the cases where mass transfer from a close binary is involved .",
    "in fact , recent radial velocity measurements , although restricted to relatively small samples , suggest than more than 90% of the central stars in pne might have companions ( e.g. @xcite ) . *    since the early observation of the pn ngc2438 , which is surrounded by stars of the open cluster ( oc ) m46 ( ngc2437 ) , photometric and spectroscopic methods",
    "have been developed to test physical associations between such objects .",
    "@xcite published a list of 10 ocs with nearby projected pne .",
    "@xcite provided a list of 13 possible physical associations and an additional list of 17 angular coincidences ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "they also present physical criteria for membership based on similarities in velocity , reddening , and the ratio of estimated distances .",
    "@xcite reviewed theoretical and observational aspects of stellar evolution to impose limiting parameters for pne to be oc members .",
    "many coincidences can be discarded if the pn is a bulge member ( @xcite ) , as indicated by position along the disk and radial velocities .",
    "ocs younger than 28myr produce type ii sn .",
    "the short - lived pn phase varies from @xmath6 to @xmath7 years , according to the progenitor mass ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and does not favour associations .",
    "pne observed in globular clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) imply that their turnoffs at @xmath8 are below the lower mass limit for pn progenitors .",
    "this invokes mass transfer in binary systems to produce pn in globular clusters .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite presented a scenario where most pne arise from binaries .",
    "consequently , care is necessary because the cluster age may not correspond to the pn mass progenitor .    among the list of 30 pn / oc coincidences provided by @xcite , we selected the pn / oc pairs ngc2818/ngc2818a and ngc2438/m46 ( ngc2437 ) .",
    "we also include pk6 + 2.5/ngc6469 and pk167 - 0.1 , which is projected in the field of an as - yet unknown star cluster .",
    "we name this low - contrast cluster newcluster1 . in the present paper",
    "we derive accurate distances to these ocs , which in turn , can be used to investigate the possible associations .                    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table notes .",

    "the number and mass of the observed ms stars ( cols .  5 and 6 , respectively ) were derived by integrati the mfs over the effective ms mass range .    to estimate the total stellar mass we extrapolate the observed mfs down to the h - burning mass limit ( @xmath11 ) . for masses below the present detection threshold ( table  [ tab5 ] )",
    "we base the extrapolation on @xcite universal imf , in which @xmath12 for the range @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "when the present mf slopes are flatter than or similar ( within uncertainties ) to kroupa s , we adopt the measured values of @xmath16 .",
    "the total ( extrapolated ms @xmath17 evolved ) values of number , mass , surface , and volume densities are given in cols .",
    "7 to 10 of table  [ tab5 ] .",
    "the mass stored in the observed ms and evolved stars of m46 amounts to @xmath18 , compatible with the populous cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the present observed mass estimate for ngc2818a , @xmath19 agrees with the estimate of @xcite .",
    "ngc6469 , and especially newcluster1 , are low - mass ocs , respectively with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the extrapolated masses are a factor @xmath22 times larger than the observed ones . as a caveat",
    "we note that the total mass estimates should be taken as upper limits , since because of dynamical evolution , significant fractions of the low - mass content may have been lost to the field .",
    "at this point it is interesting to compare the structural parameters derived for the present ocs with those of a reference sample of nearby ocs with ages in the range @xmath23myr and masses within @xmath24  ( @xcite ) . to the original reference sample",
    "were added the young ocs ngc6611 ( @xcite ) and ngc4755 ( @xcite ) .",
    "clusters are differentiated according to total mass ( smaller or larger than 1000 ) .",
    "details on parameter correlation in the reference sample are given in @xcite .    in panels ( a ) and",
    "( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we compare limiting and core radii of the present ocs with those of the reference sample in terms of cluster age . with respect to both kinds of radii , the bulge - projected ngc6469 and the poorly - populated newcluster1 appear to be significantly smaller than the nearby ocs of similar ages , especially in limiting radius .",
    "core and limiting radii in the reference sample are related by @xmath25 ( panel ( c ) ) , which suggests a similar scaling for both kinds of radii , at least for the radii ranges @xmath26 and @xmath27 . within uncertainties ,",
    "ngc2818a , m46 , ngc6469 , and newcluster1 also follow that relation .",
    "finally , except for newcluster1 , the remaining ocs appear to follow the trend of increasing limiting radii with galactocentric distance ( panel ( d ) ) . a similar dependence with holds as well for , because of the relation implied by panel ( c ) .",
    "besides the spatial coincidence , for a physical association between a pn and a star cluster to be considered as highly probable , at least the radial velocities , reddening values , and distances should be compatible . in the present work we derive reliable values of reddening ,",
    "distance from the sun , core and limiting radii for the ocs .",
    "the angular separation of the pne ngc2818 , ngc2438 , and pk6 + 2.5 with respect to the oc centres ( table  [ tab2 ] ) , corresponds to the halo ; pk167 - 0.1 , on the other hand , appears to lie near the border of newcluster1 . in all cases ,",
    "the mass at the to of the oc is consistent with the presence of a pn .",
    "based on the above criteria , the best candidate to a physical pair is the pn ngc2438 with the oc m46 .",
    "they have comparable radial velocities ( sect .  [ pair1 ] ) , and the reddening and distance from the sun for the pn are @xmath28 and @xmath29kpc ( sect .  [ pair1 ] ) , while for the oc we derive @xmath30 and @xmath31kpc . besides , the presence of a pn in m46 is compatible with the to mass , @xmath32 .    within uncertainties ,",
    "the present reddening @xmath30 for the oc ngc2818a is compatible with the @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( sect .",
    "[ pair1 ] ) for the pn ngc2818 .",
    "distances from the sun are in better agreement , @xmath35kpc for ngc2818a and @xmath36kpc for ngc2818 ( sect .",
    "[ pair1 ] ) .",
    "however , the radial velocities do not agree ( sect .",
    "[ pair1 ] ) , which could indicate a projection effect .",
    "pk6 + 2.5 does not appear to be physically associated with ngc6469 .",
    "if this nearby cluster ( table  [ tab1 ] ) has a circular orbit about the galactic centre , a small value for its radial velocity is expected from its galactic location . however , the relatively high velocity @xmath37 ( sect .",
    "[ pair3 ] ) of pk6 + 2.5 suggests rather a relation to the bulge .",
    "the distance of 1780pc of pk167 - 0.1 ( sect .",
    "[ pair4 ] ) is in excellent agreement with that derived for newcluster1 , @xmath38kpc ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this piece of evidence suggests physical association , but the cluster radial velocity should be determined for a more robust comparison .",
    "@xcite comment that most potential planetary nebulae in ocs are projected against the cluster halo . at least in part",
    ", this observation can be a direct consequence of the relatively high cluster halo / core cross section ratio , @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , from fig .  [ fig8 ] ( panel c )",
    "it follows that the limiting and core radii are related by @xmath40 , which implies that , for a typical oc , @xmath41 . in this sense ,",
    "random distributions of ( spatially unrelated ) pne and ocs would result in a significantly larger number of pne projected against halos than central regions . for",
    "the 30 spatial coincidences ( with separation @xmath5 ) , @xcite present an estimate of a nuclear radius ( @xmath42 ) and measure the angular separation of the pn with respect to the cluster centre .",
    "although their @xmath42 is not derived from radial profiles , it probably represents the core radius to some degree . for the two additional pairs dealt with in the present paper , the ratio of the number of cluster halo / core pne is @xmath43 , less than 10% of that expected of random , unrelated distributions .",
    "interestingly , for a king - like cluster characterised by the core and limiting radii  and , the number of member stars in the halo is related to that in the core by @xmath44/\\ln(2 ) - 1 $ ] .",
    "thus , for @xmath40 , we obtain @xmath45 , close to the corresponding observed ratio for the pne of @xcite .    * we further examine this issue from a different perspective , similar to that employed by @xcite to study spatial coincidences of wr stars with ocs .",
    "we compute the ratio of the pn / oc separation to the cluster apparent radius @xmath46 , based on the angular diameters given by @xcite . according to this definition , @xmath16 represents the pn separation as a function of the apparent cluster radius .",
    "next we build the surface density distribution of the measured @xmath16 values , i.e , the number of spatial coincidences characterised by @xmath16 per cluster area , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . to investigate the significance of this distribution we first test whether it could result from a random spatial distribution of pne .",
    "the 30 pn / oc angular separations in @xcite , and the 2 additional ones ( table  [ tab2 ] ) not in common with them , are restricted to @xmath47 . for each of the 32 ocs corresponding to the above spatial coincidences , we randomly take values of @xmath48 uniformly distributed in the range @xmath49 and compute @xmath16 for the actual apparent oc radius .",
    "the respective surface density distribution was built for @xmath50 runs , which was subsequently normalised to 32 objects .",
    "the measured curve presents a conspicuous excess over the simulated one for @xmath51 , which might indicate a physical relation .",
    "both curves agree for @xmath52 , within the uncertainties .",
    "the second test follows @xcite : the sign of the galactic latitude ( @xmath53 ) of each pn is reversed , but keeping the original @xmath54 . based on the new pn coordinates , we then searched for an oc that is closer than @xmath47 , a condition that was matched for 20 cases . within the uncertainties , the corresponding surface density distribution , normalised to 32 objects ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) , coincides with the simulated ( random spatial distribution of @xmath48 values ) one along the full range of @xmath16 . *",
    "the arguments above are based on the apparent cluster radii of @xcite .",
    "because they are basically visually determined , such radii , however , are significantly underestimated with respect to the limiting radii and , especially , the tidal radii .",
    "for instance , the ocs in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which are similar to those in @xcite and were studied with the same methods as in the present paper , have a limiting radius @xmath55 times larger than the apparent radius given in @xcite .",
    "thus , if a similar relation holds for the apparent and limiting radii in the present oc sample , the excess in the observed surface density ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) would correspond to pn separations @xmath56 , which again suggests a physical relation .    despite the many uncertainties associated with the above arguments , * the small number of targets and the uncertain pn distances in particular * ,",
    "it might , nevertheless , be speculated whether the relatively large fraction of core pne results from a physical relation .",
    "a cautionary remark is that the remaining spatial coincidences in @xcite should be analysed in detail for a better definition of the core and limiting radii , as well as the fundamental parameters .",
    "in the present study an open cluster was discovered ( newcluster1 ) , which is located at @xmath57 and @xmath58 . *",
    "projected on its field , with an angular separation of @xmath59 with respect to the custer centre , is the pn pk167 - 0.1 .",
    "* field - star decontaminated 2mass photometry was employed in the analysis of 4 pairs of pn / oc candidates to physical association .",
    "we derived accurate ages , distances from the sun , reddening values , and the mass at the turnoff for the clusters .",
    "cluster core and limiting radii were determined by means of radial density profiles fitted with a king - like function .    * the values of reddening and distance from the sun derived in this work suggest that the pairs pn / oc ngc2818/ngc2818a and ngc2438/m46 are compatible with physical associations . however , the available radial velocity data for ngc2818/ngc2818a favour a projection effect . *",
    "the pair pk6 + 2.5/ngc6469 appears to be physically unrelated , since the radial velocity of pk6 + 2.5 suggests a bulge membership .",
    "the pn pk167 - 0.1 is projected close to the oc newcluster1 , and the similar distances are consistent with physical association . in the cases of physical association ,",
    "the turnoff masses are compatible with the occurrence of pne .",
    "* it would be important to determine radial velocities for members of the new cluster , to compare them with that of pk167 - 0.1 , in order to further test the physical association possibility . besides , to establish the non - association of pk6 + 2.5 with ngc6469 , radial veocities of member stars are necessary . *    from the pn / oc angular positions provided by @xcite",
    ", we estimate that the fraction of pne projected against the central region of clusters , with respect to those in the halo , is significantly higher than that expected from spatially unrelated distributions of pne and ocs . besides , this fraction agrees with that expected of clusters characterised by a king - like radial stellar distribution . * in addition , we analysed the distribution of the number of spatial coincidences per cluster area built with the 32 cases dealt with in this paper .",
    "this curve was compared to that expected from a spatially - unrelated distribution of pn / oc separations and that resulting from inversion of the sign of the @xmath53 pn coordinates .",
    "the observed distribution presents a conspicuous excess , for pn / oc separations smaller than the cluster limiting radii , over both simulations , which might indicate physical relation .",
    "however , we note that these results do not take into account the rather uncertain pn distances , and radial velocities . besides",
    ", they are based on a relatively small number of spatial coincidences . in this context , it is essential to analyse in more detail ( i.e. with accurate fundamental and structural parameters ) the whole pn / oc sample of @xcite in order to investigate whether the above excess of relatively close spatial coincidences can be interpreted as physical association . *",
