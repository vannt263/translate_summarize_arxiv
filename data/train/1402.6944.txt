    "the particle creation mechanism was applied in cosmology since 1930 s by schrodinger @xcite , to examine its influence on cosmological evolution .",
    "then , after a long gap , parker @xcite and others @xcite have investigated the influence of particle creation process on the structure of cosmological spacetime .",
    "in fact , two early universe problems namely initial singularity and huge entropy production can be well addressed by the particle production process .",
    "the irreversible nature of particle creation process @xcite may avoid initial singularity considering an instability of the vacuum while irreversible energy flow from the gravitational field to the created particles may explain the huge entropy flow in the early phase .",
    "so , it is reasonable to speculate that nonequilibrium thermodynamical processes may play a crucial role to describe the early universe .    on the other hand , the common way of explaining the present accelerating phase is the introduction of dark energy ( de ) .",
    "however , the nature of de is far from being understood and also the major drawback of most of the de models in the literature have no physical basis and/or many free parameters .    among other possibilities to explain the present accelerating stage , inclusion of backreaction in the einstein field equations through an ( negative ) effective pressure is much relevant in the context of cosmology and the gravitational production of particles [ radiation or cold dark matter ( cdm ) ] provides a mechanism for cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "in particular , in comparison with de models , the particle creation scenario has a strong physical basis - nonequilibrium thermodynamics . also , the particle creation mechanism not only unifies the dark sectors ( de+dm ) @xcite but also it contains only one free parameter as we need only a single dark component ( dm ) .",
    "further , statistical bayesian analysis with one free parameter should be preferred along the hierarchy of cosmological models @xcite .",
    "so the present particle creation model which simultaneously fits the observational data and alleviates the coincidence and fine - tuning problems , is better compared to the known ( one parameter ) models , namely , i )  the concordance @xmath3cdm which however suffers from the coincidence and fine - tuning problems @xcite and ii ) the brane world cosmology @xcite which does not fit the sneia+bao+cmb ( shift parameter ) data @xcite .",
    "eckart @xcite and landau and lifschitz @xcite were the pioneers in the formulation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and are considered as first order deviations from equilibrium .",
    "these theories ( first order ) suffer from serious drawbacks concerning causality and stability due to truncation in first order .",
    "subsequently , muller @xcite , israel @xcite , israel and stewart @xcite , pavon et al .",
    "@xcite and hiscock @xcite developed second order thermodynamical theories . in these theories ,",
    "the dissipative phenomena like bulk and shear viscosity and heat flux which describe the deviations of a relativistic fluid from local equilibrium , become dynamical variables having causal evolution equations . also , the evolution equations restrict the propagation speeds of thermal and viscous perturbations to subluminal level and one may get back to the first order theory if second order effects are eliminated ( i.e. , relaxation time approaches zero ) .    in the backgroud of the homogeneous and isotropic models of the universe ,",
    "bulk viscosity is the only dissipative phenomenon and it may occur either due to coupling of different components of the cosmic substratum @xcite or due to particle number non - conserving interactions . here , quantum particle production out of the gravitational field @xcite is considered and so the present work is related to the second choice for the occurence of bulk viscosity .",
    "further , we shall concentrate on isentropic ( adiabatic ) particle production @xcite , i.e. , production of perfect fluid particles whose entropy per particle is constant .",
    "however , due to increase of perfect fluid particles , the phase space of the system is enlarged and as a result , there is entropy production .",
    "also , the condition for isentropic process gives a simple relation between the bulk viscous pressure and the particle creation rate and hence the particle production rate is no longer a parameter , it becomes a dynamical variable @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we start with entropy flow vector due to israel and stewart and combine with cosmological particle production characterized by isentropic process . assuming phenomenologically the particle production rate as a function of the hubble parameter , cosmological solutions and thermodynamical parameters like entropy and temperature",
    "are evaluated at various stages of the evolution ( inflationary phase , matter dominated era and late time acceleration ) of the universe . finally , assuming the deceleration parameter as a function of the redshift variable ( @xmath2 ) , the particle production rate and the thermodynamical parameters are expressed as a function of @xmath2 and their variations are presented graphically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 deals with the second order formulation of israel and stewart , the cosmological solutions and thermodynamical variables are presented in section 3 for different stages of evolution of the universe .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the determination of the particle creation rate and the thermodynamical parameters , both analytically and graphically as a function of the redshift variable @xmath2 .",
    "the summary of the work is presented in section 5 .",
    "for a closed thermodynamical system having @xmath4 particles , the first law of thermodynamics states the conservation of internal energy @xmath5 as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the thermodynamic pressure , @xmath8 is any comoving volume and @xmath9 represents the heat received by the system in time @xmath10 . now defining @xmath11 as the energy density , @xmath12 , the particle number density and @xmath13",
    ", the heat per unit particle , the above conservation law takes the form @xmath14 note that this equation ( known as gibb s equation ) is also true when the thermodynamical system is not closed , i.e. , @xmath4 is not constant [ @xmath15 .",
    "we shall now consider an open thermodynamical system where the number of fluid particles is not preserved .",
    "so the particle conservation equation    @xmath16    is now modified as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the particle flow vector , @xmath19 is the particle four velocity , @xmath20 is the fluid expansion , @xmath21 and @xmath22 stands for the rate of change of the particle number in a comoving volume @xmath8 , @xmath23 indicates particle creation while @xmath24 means particle annihilation .",
    "any non - zero @xmath22 will effectively behave as a bulk viscous pressure of the thermodynamical fluid and nonequilibrium thermodynamics should come into the picture .",
    "thus , in the context of particle creation , we shall consider spatially flat frw model of the universe with line element @xmath25\\ ] ] as an open thermodynamical system .",
    "for the cosmic fluid having energy - momentum tensor @xmath26 the einstein field equations are @xmath27 and the energy conservation relation @xmath28 gives @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the einstein s gravitational constant and the pressure term @xmath31 is related to some dissipative phenomenon ( bulk viscosity ) . however , in the context of particle creation , the cosmic fluid may be considered as a perfect fluid and the dissipative term @xmath31 as the effective bulk viscous pressure due to particle production . in other words ,",
    "the cosmic substratum is not a conventional dissipative fluid , rather a perfect fluid with varying particle number .",
    "this statement can clearly be understood for the simple case of adiabatic ( i.e. , isentropic ) particle production as follows @xcite    starting from the gibb s relation [ i.e. , from eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] @xmath32 and using the conservation equations ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) , the entropy variation can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the entropy per particle and @xmath35 is the temperature of the fluid .",
    "now for isentropic process , the entropy per particle remains constant ( variable in a dissipative process ) , i.e. , @xmath36 and hence we have @xmath37 thus , the bulk viscous pressure is entirely determined by the particle production rate .",
    "so we may say that at least for the adiabatic process , a dissipative fluid is equivalent to a perfect fluid with varying particle number .",
    "further , although @xmath36 still there is entropy production due to the enlargement of the phase space of the system ( i.e. , due to expansion of the universe in the present context ) .",
    "so the effective bulk pressure does not characterize a conventional nonequilibrium , rather a state having equilibrium properties as well ( but not the equilibrium era with @xmath38 ) .    now using the einstein field equations ( 6 ) ,",
    "the condition for adiabatic process [ i.e. , eq . ( 10 ) ] can be stated as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath0 is the equation of state ( eos ) for the cosmic fluid .    in an open thermodynamical system",
    ", the entropy change @xmath40 can be decomposed into an entropy flow @xmath41 and the entropy creation @xmath42 , i.e. , @xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 . as in a homogeneous system @xmath45 but",
    "there is entropy production due to matter creation , so we have @xmath46 i.e. , on integration , @xmath47,\\ ] ] with @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "further , from euler s relation , @xmath50 and using the conservation relations ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) , the tempertaure of the cosmic fluid is given by @xmath51 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & t_1 \\left(\\frac{s}{a^3}\\right)^{\\gamma -1 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath52 .",
    "this section is divided into two subsections . in the first subsection ,",
    "cosmological solutions for phenomenological values of the particle creation rate ( as a function of the hubble parameter ) have been determined and thermodynamical parameters ( namely , entropy and temperature ) have been evaluated . in the next subsection , a field theoretic description has been shown for the above choices of the particle creation rate parameter .",
    "* case i : * early epochs  in the very early universe , ( starting from a regular vacuum ) most of the particle creation effectively takes place and from thermodynamical point of view we have @xcite    1 .   at the beginning of expansion",
    ", there should be maximal entropy production rate ( i.e. , maximal particle creation rate ) so that the universe evolves from nonequilibrium thermodynamical state to equilibrium era with the expansion of the universe .",
    "2 .   a regular ( true ) vacuum for radiation",
    "initially , i.e. , @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "3 .   @xmath55 in the very early universe so that the created radiation behaves as thermalized heat bath and subsequently the creation rate should fall slower than expansion rate and particle creation becomes dynamically insignificant .",
    "now , according to gunzig et al .",
    "@xcite , the simplest choice satisfying the above requirements is that the particle creation rate is proportional to the energy density @xcite , i.e. , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 has the dimension of hubble parameter ( i.e. , reciprocal of time ) .",
    "thus @xmath58 has the dimension of @xmath59 .    for this choice of @xmath22 , the hubble parameter can be obtained from eq .",
    "( 11 ) as @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath58 is the constant of proportionality and @xmath57 is the hubble parameter at some fixed time @xmath61 [ with @xmath62 .",
    "thus , as @xmath54 , @xmath63 , indicating an exponential expansion ( @xmath64 ) in the inflationary era while for @xmath65 , @xmath66 represents the standard frw cosmology ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "suppose @xmath68 is identified as some intermediate value of @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( i.e. , the transition epoch from de sitter stage to standard radiation era ) .",
    "then we have @xmath71 and from eq .",
    "( 11 ) @xmath72 hence for relativistic matter ( i.e. , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 which on integration gives @xcite @xmath76.\\ ] ] so in the limiting situation @xcite , @xmath77 thus , in the standard cosmological regime , the rate of particle production @xmath22 decreases as inverse square law , i.e. , @xmath78 . also from eqs .",

    "thus we see that in the radiation era ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) , we have @xmath87 , i.e. , the universe as a thermodynamical system behaves as a black body @xcite .",
    "+   + * case ii : * intermediate decelerating phase  here , the simplest natural choice is @xmath88 @xcite . it should be noted that this choice of @xmath22 does not satisfy the third thermodynamical requirement at the early universe ( mentioned above ) . also , the solution [ see eq .",
    "( 24 ) ] will not satisfy the above condition ( ii ) .    for this choice of @xmath22",
    ", one can integrate eq . (",
    "11 ) to obtain @xmath89 which is the usual power law expansion of the universe in standard cosmology with particle production rate decreases as @xmath90 . hence @xmath91 ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) does not satisfy the true vacuum condition",
    "also , the entropy grows as power law @xmath93 while the expression for temperature is given by @xmath94 this temperature may be thought of as analogous to the reheating temperature in standard models .",
    "also note that the expression for the temperature becomes constant in dust era ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) or when @xmath96 . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the temperature gradually increases with the evolution of the universe till dust era and then it gradually decreases .",
    "+   + * case iii : * late time accelerated expansion  in this case , the thermodynamical requirements of case i are modified as    1",
    ".   there should be minimum entropy production rate at the beginning of the late time accelerated expansion and the universe again becomes thermodynamically nonequilibrium .",
    "2 .   the late time",
    "false vacuum should have @xmath53 as @xmath98 .",
    "the creation rate should be faster than the expansion rate .",
    "we shall now show that another simple choice of @xmath22 , namely @xmath99 will satisfy these requirements .",
    "this choice of @xmath22 gives the hubble parameter [ by integrating eq .",
    "( 11 ) ] as @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the constant of proportionality and @xmath102 is the value of the scale factor at the instant when the universe enters the quintessence era . integrating again , we have from ( 27 ) , @xmath103^{\\left(\\frac{2}{3\\gamma}\\right)}.\\ ] ] hence for @xmath104 , @xmath105 , i.e. , the usual power law expansion in standard cosmology while @xmath106 when @xmath107 , i.e. , the accelerated expansion at late time ( in quintessence era ) .",
    "so in the matter dominated era ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) , @xmath22 grows as @xmath108 and gradually it approaches the constant value @xmath109 in the quitessence era . for this choice of @xmath22 ,",
    "the thermodynamical parameters are given by @xmath110^{\\left(\\frac{2}{\\gamma}\\right)}\\ ] ] and @xmath111^{\\frac{2(\\gamma -1)}{\\gamma}}.\\ ] ] note that at the instant @xmath112 , i.e. , the beginning of the quintessence era , the entropy function has the minimum value while the temperature blows up there .",
    "hence the first modified thermodynamical requirement is satisfied .",
    "also the above solution shows that @xmath53 as @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , this choice of @xmath22 correctly describes the late time acceleration .      if the present particle creation model is equivalent to a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath113 having potential @xmath114 , then eq . (",
    "11 ) modifies to @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the effective eos parameter for the scalar field and @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the energy density and thermodynamic pressure for the scalar field .",
    "note that the effective eos parameter @xmath119 is constant when @xmath88 while for the other two cases ( i.e. , @xmath120 or @xmath99 ) , the effective eos is variable .",
    "further , the ratio of the state parameters will characterize whether there will be creation or annihilation of particles .",
    "in particular , if the kinetic energy ( k.e . ) of the scalar field dominates over its potential energy ( p.e . ) , i.e. , @xmath121 , then there is always particle annihilation when @xmath122 . on the other hand , if the p.e . of the scalar field",
    "dominates over its k.e .",
    "( scalar field behaves as a cosmological constant ) , i.e. , @xmath123 , then there will always be particle creation with @xmath124 .",
    "however , if @xmath125 , i.e. , @xmath126 , then particle creation or annihilation will depend on whether @xmath127 or @xmath128 .",
