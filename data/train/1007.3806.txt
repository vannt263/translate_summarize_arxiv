    "proton coupled electron transfer ( pcet ) reactions are important in many chemical , biological and electro - chemical processes.@xcite we consider in this paper the case of concerted pcet reactions , where the proton and electron are transferred simultaneously with no stable intermediates .",
    "theories of pcet reactions were developed over the past two decades .",
    "cukier has proposed a theory for concerted pcet based on nonadiabatic transitions between multiple vibronic states,@xcite which treats the proton coordinate as a high frequency intramolecular vibrational mode , and leads to rate constant expressions similar to the bixon - jortner model@xcite for the electron transfer ( et ) reactions.@xcite hammes - schiffer and coworkers have generalized this theory to include the environmental collective coordinate that couples to the proton coordinate.@xcite    recent works on the pcet theory have focused on the importance of the proton donor - acceptor motion .",
    "the main concept is that fluctuations of the donor - acceptor separation @xmath0 strongly affect the vibrational wave function overlap for the proton coordinate , and thus the effective transfer integral between vibronic states .",
    "such effect has been first investigated in the case of vibrationally nonadiabatic proton transfer reactions , and is found to play an important role and leads to much smaller kinetic isotope effect ( kie ) than simple estimation using the overlap of vibrational wave functions at the equilibrium proton donor - acceptor distance.@xcite the effect of the donor - acceptor motion has also been widely discussed in recent pcet theories.@xcite in these theoretical treatments , the proton degree of freedom is first quantized , and a born - oppenheimer approximation is applied to separate the proton motion and the slower degrees of freedom that couple to it .",
    "the pcet problem is then reduced to transitions between a group of vibronic states . within the above theoretical framework ,",
    "the effect of donor - acceptor motion can be treated either statically by doing a thermal average over the @xmath0 distribution,@xcite or can be treated dynamically using a time correlation function formalism.@xcite    it is interesting to investigate the applicability of the bo approximation to the proton motion for several reasons .",
    "first , although the masses of proton and deuterium are much less than those of the heavy atoms , the difference is not as dramatic as the mass ratio between the electron and nuclei .",
    "when the hydrogen bond is stiff between the donor and acceptor , high frequency donor - acceptor motion raise the question whether a separation of time scales is still appropriate .",
    "second , even after the bo approximation is applied to separate the proton motion and the proton donor - acceptor motion , additional approximations such as static donor - acceptor motion,@xcite or analytical approximations on the vibrational wave function overlap are often employed.@xcite it is also desirable to test these approximations quantitatively using a solvable model .    in this paper , we provide tests of the above mentioned bo approximation for the proton motion using a model hamiltonian for concerted pcet reactions .",
    "we show that , under certain well defined approximations , the effect of proton donor - acceptor motion can be incorporated in a model hamiltonian base on the duschinsky rotation effect ( dre).@xcite the dre describes the mixing of the normal modes between the donor and acceptor potential energy surfaces,@xcite which is different from the linear displaced harmonic modes used in the conventional spin - boson model.@xcite during the past years , the effect of dre have been widely discussed in areas such as electronic spectroscopy,@xcite nonadiabatic relaxations,@xcite and electron transfer reactions.@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , a model based on the dre has not been applied in studies of pcet previously .",
    "when the electronic coupling is small , the dre model allows us to calculate the pcet reaction rates analytically using the fermi s golden rule .",
    "this analytically solvable model is then applied to assess the bo approximation for the proton motion , as well as the static donor - acceptor motion approximation and the analytical approximations to the vibrational wave function overlaps .",
