    "in this paper we are interested in the polynomials @xmath0 that are orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath1 on @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the bessel function of order @xmath8 . the bessel function is oscillatory with an amplitude that decays like @xmath9 as @xmath10 , and therefore the moments @xmath11 do not exist .",
    "it follows that the polynomials @xmath0 can not be defined by the usual orthogonality property @xmath12    asheim and huybrechs @xcite introduced the polynomials @xmath0 via a regularization of the weight with an exponential factor . for each @xmath13 , they consider the monic polynomial @xmath14 of degree @xmath15 that is orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath16 , in the following sense : @xmath17 and they take the limit @xmath18 provided that the limit exists . since the weight function @xmath19 changes sign on the positive real axis , there is actually no guarantee for existence or uniqueness of @xmath14 . for the limit",
    "we therefore also have to assume that @xmath14 exists and is unique for @xmath15 large enough .",
    "the polynomials @xmath0 can alternatively be defined by the moments , since the limiting moments for the bessel function of order @xmath8 are known , namely @xmath20 see @xcite .",
    "thus we have the determinantal formula ( which is familiar from the general theory of orthogonal polynomials ) @xmath21 with a hankel determinant @xmath22_{i , j=0}^{n-1}$ ] .",
    "the polynomial @xmath0 thus exists if and only if @xmath23 .",
    "asheim and huybrechs @xcite analyze gaussian quadrature rules with oscillatory weight functions , such as complex exponentials , airy and bessel functions .",
    "the nodes for the gaussian quadrature rule are the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials .",
    "since the weight is not real and positive on the interval of orthogonality there is a problem of existence and uniqueness of the orthogonal polynomials . in addition , even when the orthogonal polynomial exists , its zeros may not be real , and they may distribute themselves on some curve or union of curves in the complex plane as the degree tends to infinity .",
    "examples of this kind of behavior are known in the literature , for instance with laguerre or jacobi polynomials with non  standard parameters , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and for complex exponentials @xcite .",

    "namely , if @xmath25 are the zeros of the orthogonal polynomial of degree @xmath26 ( where @xmath15 is even ) with respect to the positive weight @xmath27 on @xmath2 , then the zeros of @xmath0 are @xmath28 . here",

    "for @xmath30 the zeros of @xmath0 are not on the imaginary axis , as is clear from the illustrations given in @xcite , see also the figures [ fig : points_plot_small ] and [ fig : points_plot_big ] .",
    "the computations have been carried out in maple , using extended precision . from these numerical experiments",
    "asheim and huybrechs @xcite concluded that the zeros seem to cluster along the vertical line @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath31 , one sees in figure [ fig : points_plot_small ] that the vast majority of zeros are near a vertical line , which is indeed at @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath32 one sees in figure [ fig : points_plot_big ] that the zeros with large imaginary part are close to the vertical line @xmath5 , although they are not as close to the vertical line as the zeros in figure [ fig : points_plot_small ] .",
    "we were intrigued by these figures and the aim of this paper is to give a partial explanation of the observed behavior of zeros .",
    "we are able to analyze the polynomials @xmath0 when @xmath33 in the large @xmath15 limit by means of a riemann - hilbert analysis .",
    "the result is that we indeed find that the real parts of most of the zeros tend to @xmath34 as @xmath4 .",
    "we are not able to handle the case @xmath32 , since in this case our method to construct a local parametrix at the origin fails .",
    "this difficulty may very well be related to the different behavior of the zeros in the case @xmath32 .",
    "it would be very interesting to analyze this case as well . from the figures it seems that there is a limiting curve for the scaled zeros , if we divide the imaginary parts of the zeros by @xmath15 and keeping the real parts fixed .",
    "this limiting curve is a vertical line segment if @xmath31 ( this will follow from our results ) , but we do not know the nature of this curve if @xmath32 .",
    "our first result is about the weak limit of zeros .",

    "in addition , the zeros of @xmath36 all tend to the interval @xmath37 $ ] and have the limiting density @xmath38.\\ ] ]    the convergence of zeros to the limiting density is in the sense of weak convergence of normalized zero counting measures .",

    "we prove the existence of a local parametrix around the origin , but we do not have an explicit construction with special functions .",
    "therefore we can not analyze the zeros near the origin .",
    "on the other hand , we do have potential access to the extreme zeros in the disks @xmath66 since the asymptotics of the polynomials @xmath36 is given in terms of airy functions . from the figures it seems that the result also holds for the extreme zeros , but we omit this asymptotic result in theorem [ th1 ] , since it does not follow clearly from the construction of the local parametrices in this case .",

    "this continues to be the case for the weights as is claimed by theorem [ th0 ] .",

    "there is much recent progress in the understanding of toeplitz and hankel determinants with such singularities @xcite .",
    "this is also related to the asymptotics of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials , whose local behavior near a fisher - hartwig singularity is described with the aid of confluent hypergeometric functions , see the works of deift , its and krasovsky @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "we are facing the complication that the fisher - hartwig singularity is combined with a logarithmic divergence of the density @xmath86 at the origin , see .",
    "in our riemann - hilbert analysis we were not able to construct a local parametrix with special functions , and we had to resort to an existence proof , where we used ideas from @xcite and @xcite , although our proof is at the technical level different from either of these papers .",

    "the local parametrices near the endpoints @xmath135 involve airy functions , since the density @xmath136 in behaves like a square root in a neighborhood of these endpoints .",
    "the main difficulty of the analysis is the construction of a local parametrix in a neighborhood of the origin , and the reason is the lack of analyticity of the weight function @xmath137 in that neighborhood . in this paper",
    ", we reduce the jump matrices in that local analysis to almost constant in a disk around @xmath138 and then use a small norm argument in @xmath139 to prove existence of a solution to this local rh problem . in this respect ,",

    "also , the same limiting potential @xmath140 appears in the work of bleher and bothner in @xcite .",
    "another example of non  analytic weight function was considered in the work of foulqui , martnez  finkelshtein and sousa , see @xcite and @xcite , although in this case the local parametrix at the origin is explicitly given in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "finally , in section [ proofs ] we follow the transformations both outside and inside the lens , but away from the origin , to get the asymptotic information about @xmath87 and its zeros .",
    "this proves theorem [ th1 ] and [ th3 ] .",
