    "* motivation * kitaev models @xcite and lewin - wen models @xcite , which were shown to be equivalent to kitaev models in @xcite , have attracted strong interest in condensed matter physics and topological quantum computing . they assign to an oriented surface @xmath2 a finite - dimensional hilbert space , the _ protected space _ , which is a topological invariant of @xmath2 .",
    "they also exhibit topological excitations with braid group statistics , electro - magnetic duality and can be equipped with additional structures such as defects and domain walls @xcite , which are a focus of current research .",
    "kitaev models are also of strong interest from the perspective of topological quantum field theory as they are related to turaev - viro tqfts @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the protected space of a kitaev model for a finite - dimensional semisimple hopf algebra @xmath0 on an oriented surface @xmath2 coincides with the vector space @xmath3 that the turaev - viro tqft for the representation category @xmath0-mod assigns to @xmath2 .",
    "if one interprets turaev - viro invariants as a discretised path integrals @xcite , kitaev models can be viewed as their hamiltonian counterparts . from this point of view , the linear map @xmath4 that the turaev - viro tqft assigns to a 3-manifold with boundary @xmath5 describes a transition between kitaev models on @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "this relation between kitaev models and tqfts extends to the case with excitations .",
    "excitations in a kitaev model for @xmath0 are labelled by representations of the drinfeld double @xmath1 and correspond to turaev - viro tqfts with line defects @xcite .",
    "these were essential in establishing the equivalence of turaev - viro tqfts for @xmath0-mod and the reshetikhin - turaev tqfts for @xmath1-mod in @xcite .",
    "the topological nature of kitaev models and their relation to turaev - viro and reshetikhin - turaev tqfts raises three obvious questions , which remained open despite their conceptual importance :    is there a hamiltonian analogue of reshetikhin - turaev tqfts defined along the same lines as kitaev models ?",
    "if yes , can one precisely relate the kitaev model for a hopf algebra @xmath0 and the hamiltonian analogue of a reshetikhin - turaev tqft for its drinfeld double @xmath1 ?",
    "+    can a kitaev model for a hopf algebra @xmath0 be viewed as a hopf algebra analogue of a group - valued lattice gauge theory ?",
    "this is strongly suggested by the structure of kitaev models , e.  g.  that they are defined in terms of a graph embedded in a surface @xmath2 , that they exhibit symmetries at each vertex and face of the graph and that these symmetries act trivially on the protected space .",
    "it is also likely due to their relation to reshetikhin - turaev tqfts , which were obtained by quantising chern - simons gauge theories @xcite .",
    "+    are there classical analogues of a kitaev models defined in terms of poisson or symplectic structures associated with @xmath2 ?",
    "although kitaev models were defined ad hoc and not by quantising classical structures , this seems natural due to their interpretation as quantum models .",
    "it is also suggested by their relation to reshetikhin - turaev tqfts , which quantise chern - simons gauge theories and hence moduli spaces of flat connections on @xmath2 .",
    "the article addresses these three questions .",
    "more specifically , we show that the algebra of operators that act on the protected space of a kitaev model is isomorphic to the quantum moduli algebra obtained in the combinatorial quantisation of chern - simons gauge theory by alekseev , grosse and schomerus @xcite and by buffenoir and roche @xcite . the protected space of a kitaev model for a finite - dimensional semisimple hopf algebra @xmath0 is therefore given as a representation space of the quantum moduli algebra for its drinfeld double @xmath1 .",
    "this establishes a complete equivalence between the kitaev models and the combinatorial quantisation of chern - simons theory and shows that kitaev models are not a new class of models but a special case of the older and more general models in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that the quantum moduli algebra can be viewed as the hamiltonian analogue of a reshetikhin - turaev tqft .",
    "its representation spaces coincide with the vector spaces @xmath7 that the reshetikhin - turaev tqft assigns to @xmath2 , and both give rise to the same action of the mapping class group @xmath8 .",
    "this addresses the first question and establishes a relation @xmath9 between kitaev model for @xmath0 and the combinatorial model for @xmath1 that is analogous to the relation between a turaev - viro tqft for the representation category @xmath0-mod and the reshetikhin - turaev tqft for the representation category @xmath1-mod from @xcite : @xmath10^{\\cite{bk , kkr , kmr}}_{\\text{hamiltonian analogue } } \\ar[r]^{\\cite{ba1,ba2,kb , tvi}\\qquad } & \\ar[l ] \\qquad \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{\\framebox{reshetikhin - turaev tqft for $ d(h)$-mod } } \\ar[d]_{\\cite{as , br2}}^{\\text{hamiltonian analogue}}\\\\ \\text{\\framebox{kitaev model for $ h$ } }   \\ar@{-->}[r]^{(*)\\qquad\\qquad } &   \\ar@{-->}[l ] \\text { \\framebox{combinatorial model for $ d(h)$ } }   } \\ ] ] as the quantum moduli algebra was obtained in @xcite by canonically quantising the symplectic structure on the moduli space of flat connections on @xmath2 from @xcite , this also addresses the third question about the corresponding poisson and symplectic structures .",
    "moreover , all structures that describe the relation between the two models have poisson analogues in the theory of poisson - lie groups .",
    "although this aspect is not developed further here , this defines poisson analogues of kitaev models and relates them to symplectic structures on moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces .",
    "finally , it was shown in @xcite that the combinatorial model @xcite can be derived from a set of simple axioms that generalise group valued lattice gauge theories to ribbon hopf algebras .",
    "these axioms encode minimal physics requirements for a local lattice gauge theory and imply that the relevant mathematical structures are module algebras over hopf algebras . in this sense ,",
    "the combinatorial model is a generalisation of the notion of a lattice gauge theory from a group to a ribbon hopf algebra .",
    "the equivalence of kitaev models to combinatorial models shows that the former can indeed be interpreted as a hopf algebra valued lattice gauge theory .",
    "this viewpoint is also essential in establishing the correspondence between the two models .",
    "many of the results in @xcite and in @xcite are formulated in terms of matrix elements in irreducible representations .",
    "while this presents certain computational advantages within the models , it becomes an obstacle when relating them .",
    "the more algebraic and basis independent formulation in terms of a hopf algebra gauge theory in @xcite allows one to relate the models in a simpler and more conceptual way .    in this article",
    "we consider kitaev models for a finite - dimensional semisimple hopf algebra @xmath0 , as introduced in @xcite , and the combinatorial model for the drinfeld double @xmath1 from @xcite , in its formulation as a hopf algebra gauge theory @xcite .",
    "besides the hopf algebras @xmath0 and @xmath1 the input data in both models is a ribbon graph @xmath11 , a directed graph with a cyclic ordering of the edge ends at each vertex .",
    "the relation between the two models is obtained by thickening @xmath11 to a ribbon graph @xmath12 in which each edge of @xmath11 is replaced by a rectangle and each vertex of @xmath11 by a polygon . while the hopf algebra gauge theory is associated with the ribbon graph @xmath11 , the natural setting for the kitaev model is the thickened graph @xmath12 .",
    "the concept that is fundamental in relating the two models is _ holonomy _ , which we define as a functor from the path groupoid of @xmath11 or @xmath12 into a category constructed from the hopf algebra data . for _ ribbon paths _ these holonomies yield kitaev s _ ribbon operators _ @xcite .",
    "however , our notion of holonomy is more general and defined for any path in @xmath12 , not only ribbon paths .",
    "this is essential in relating the two models . by selecting an adjacent face at each vertex - a _ site _ in the language of kitaev models or a _ cilium _ in the language of hopf algebra gauge theory - we associate to each oriented edge @xmath13 the following two paths @xmath14 in @xmath12 .",
    "the holonomies of the paths @xmath14 , which are _ not _ ribbon paths in the sense of @xcite , coincide . by sending the holonomy of an edge @xmath15 of @xmath11 to the holonomies of the paths @xmath14 in @xmath12 ,",
    "we then obtain an explicit relation between the algebraic structures in a hopf algebra gauge theory and in the kitaev models .",
    "this relation involves three layers :    @xmath16 * the algebra of functions and the algebra of triangle operators : * the algebra @xmath17 of functions in a hopf algebra gauge theory for @xmath1 is the vector space @xmath18 obtained by associating a copy of the dual hopf algebra @xmath19 to each edge of @xmath11 . however , its algebra structure is not the canonical one from the tensor product , but deformed at each vertex by the universal @xmath20-matrix of @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding structure in the kitaev model for @xmath0 is the algebra generated by the triangle operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 for each each edge @xmath15 of @xmath11 and indexed by elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "these triangle operators act on the extended hilbert space @xmath25 of the model via the left and right regular action of @xmath0 and @xmath26 on @xmath0 .",
    "they form an algebra isomorphic to the @xmath27-fold tensor product @xmath28 of the heisenberg double of @xmath0 .",
    "the first central result is that under certain assumptions on @xmath11 these two algebras are isomorphic ( theorems [ th : hdcomb ] and [ th : chiiso ] ) :    let @xmath11 be a regular ribbon graph .",
    "then the holonomies of the paths @xmath14 induce an algebra isomorphism @xmath29 from the algebra of functions @xmath17 of a hopf algebra gauge theory for @xmath1 to the algebra formed by the triangle operators in the kitaev model for @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath16 * gauge symmetries : * the second layer of correspondence concerns the gauge symmetries of the two models .",
    "gauge transformations in the hopf algebra gauge theory are obtained by associating a copy of the drinfeld double @xmath1 to each vertex of @xmath11 and are given by the hopf algebra @xmath30 .",
    "the algebra @xmath17 of functions is a module algebra over this hopf algebra .",
    "consequently , the submodule of invariants is a subalgebra @xmath31 , the subalgebra of gauge invariant _",
    "observables_.    these gauge symmetries correspond to the symmetries associated with the _ vertex _ and _ face operators _ in the kitaev models .",
    "these operators are given as the holonomies of paths in @xmath12 that go clockwise around the vertices and faces of @xmath11 .",
    "for each site of @xmath11 , they define a faithful representation of the drinfeld double @xmath1 .",
    "our second main result in theorem [ lem : actedge ] states that these representations give the algebra of triangle operators the structure of a module algebra over the hopf algebra @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , we find that the algebra isomorphism that relates it to the algebra of functions in a hopf algebra gauge theory is compatible with these gauge symmetries :    for each regular ribbon graph @xmath11 , the vertex and face operators equip the algebra @xmath32 of triangle operators with the structure of a @xmath30-right module algebra .",
    "the algebra isomorphism @xmath29 is a module morphism and induces an algebra isomorphism between the subalgebras of invariants @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath16 * curvature : * the third layer of correspondence between kitaev models and hopf algebra gauge theories concerns _ curvatures _ , which are the holonomies of the faces of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the hopf algebra gauge theory ,",
    "the holonomies of the faces of @xmath11 give rise to an algebra morphism from the character algebra or the centre of @xmath1 into the centre @xmath35 of the algebra of gauge invariant observables . by taking the product of these holonomies over all faces of @xmath11 and inserting the haar integral of @xmath1 ,",
    "one obtains a projector on the _ quantum moduli algebra _ @xmath36 .    as the faces of the thickened graph @xmath12 correspond to either faces , vertices or edges of @xmath11 and the holonomies of the latter are trivial , curvatures in kitaev models are given by the vertex and face operators .",
    "by taking the product of these holonomies for all vertices and faces of @xmath11 and inserting the haar integrals of the hopf algebras @xmath0 and @xmath26 one obtains kitaev s _ hamiltonian _ @xmath37 , which is a projector from the extended hilbert space @xmath25 on the _ protected space_.    we show that the hamiltonian defines a projector on a subalgebra @xmath38 , which consists of those elements that satisfy the relation @xmath39 .",
    "this is the subalgebra of operators that act on the _ protected space_. we then prove that for each site of @xmath11 the algebra isomorphism @xmath40 sends the holonomy of the associated face in @xmath11 to the product of the associated vertex and face operator of the kitaev model .",
    "this leads to our third main result in theorem [ th : modth ] :    for each regular ribbon graph @xmath11 , the algebra isomorphism @xmath29 induces an algebra isomorphism @xmath41 .",
    "both , the quantum moduli algebra @xmath36 and kitaev s protected space were shown to be topological invariants @xcite .",
    "they depend only on the homeomorphism class of the oriented surface obtained by gluing discs to the faces of @xmath11 .",
    "as the same holds for the algebra @xmath42 this theorem establishes a precise equivalence between the topological invariants of the kitaev model for @xmath0 and the hopf algebra gauge theory for @xmath1 .",
    "this equivalence between kitaev models and hopf algebra gauge theory also has a geometrical interpretation .",
    "the thickened ribbon graph @xmath12 for the kitaev model can be viewed as a ` graph double ' of the ribbon graph @xmath12 , because it combines the ribbon graph @xmath11 with its poincar dual @xmath43 . in kitaev models poincar duality",
    "corresponds to hopf algebra duality : the edges of @xmath12 associated with edges of @xmath11 carry the triangle operators @xmath22 indexed by elements @xmath24 .",
    "the edges of @xmath12 associated with edges of @xmath44 carry the triangle operators @xmath45 indexed by elements @xmath23 .",
    "this allows one to view the kitaev model for the hopf algebra @xmath0 as a _",
    "factorisation _ of the hopf algebra gauge theory for the drinfeld double @xmath1 , in which gauge fields on @xmath11 with values in @xmath1 are factorised into gauge fields on @xmath11 and on @xmath43 with values in @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath1-valued gauge transformations and curvatures in the hopf algebra gauge theory factorise into gauge transformations and curvatures on @xmath11 and on @xmath43 with values in @xmath46 and @xmath47 . the former are associated with vertex and the latter with face operators .    * structure of the article : * in section [ sec : background ] we introduce the relevant notation , the background on hopf algebras and the graph theoretical background needed in the article .",
    "section [ subsec : kit ] contains a brief summary of kitaev models , and section [ sec : gtheory ] summarises the background on combinatorial quantisation and hopf algebra gauge theory . in section [ sec : holkitaev ]",
    "we introduce a generalised notion of holonomy for kitaev models , investigate its algebraic properties and show that it reduces to the ribbon operators for ribbon paths .",
    "in particular , this applies to the holonomies of paths around the vertices and faces of @xmath11 , which define the vertex and face operators of the kitaev model .    in section [ subsec : gsymmflat ]",
    "we show that kitaev models exhibit the mathematical structures of a hopf algebra gauge theory .",
    "we prove that the vertex and face operators give the algebra of triangle operators the structure of a right module algebra over a hopf algebra of gauge transformations and investigate its subalgebra of invariants .",
    "we show that the hamiltonian of the kitaev model arises from the curvatures of the faces of @xmath12 and projects on a subalgebra of operators on the protected space .",
    "sections [ sec : kithopf ] and [ sec : qmod ] contain the core results of the article . in section [ sec : kithopf ] we prove that under certain assumptions on @xmath11 the holonomies of the paths @xmath14 in @xmath12 induce an algebra isomorphism between the algebra of functions of a hopf algebra gauge theory and kitaev s triangle operator algebra . in section [ sec : qmod ] we show that this algebra isomorphism is a morphism of module algebras and hence induces an isomorphism between their subalgebras of invariants .",
    "we then establish that this algebra isomorphism relates the curvatures of the two models and prove that it induces an isomorphism between the quantum moduli algebra and the algebra of operators acting on the protected space .",
    "throughout the article @xmath48 is a field of characteristic zero . for an algebra @xmath49 and @xmath50",
