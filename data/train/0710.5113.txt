    "in physics , formal simplicity is often a reliable guide to the significance of a result .",
    "the concept of weak measurement , due to aharonov and his coworkers @xcite , derives some of its appeal from the formal simplicity of its basic formulae .",
    "one can extend the basic concept to a sequence of weak measurements carried out at a succession of points during the evolution of a system @xcite , but then the formula relating pointer positions to weak values turns out to be not quite so simple , particularly if one allows arbitrary initial conditions for the measuring system .",
    "i show here that the complications largely disappear if one takes the cumulants of expected values of pointer positions ; these are related in a formally satisfying way to weak values , and this form is preserved under all measurement conditions .",
    "the goal of weak measurement is to obtain information about a quantum system given both an initial state @xmath0 and a final , post - selected state @xmath1 .",
    "since weak measurement causes only a small disturbance to the system , the measurement result can reflect both the initial and final states .",
    "it can therefore give richer information than a conventional ( strong ) measurement , including in particular the results of all possible strong measurements @xcite . to carry out the measurement , a measuring device",
    "is coupled to the system in such a way that the system is only slightly perturbed ; this can be achieved by having a small coupling constant @xmath2 . after the interaction , the pointer s position @xmath3 is measured ( or possibly some other pointer observable ; e.g. its momentum @xmath4 ) .",
    "suppose that , following the standard von neumann paradigm , @xcite , the interaction between measuring device and system is taken to be @xmath5 , where @xmath4 is the momentum of a pointer and the delta function indicates an impulsive interaction at time @xmath6 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the expectation of the pointer position , ignoring terms of order @xmath7 or higher , is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the _ weak value _ of the observable @xmath10 given by @xmath11    as can be seen , ( [ qclassic ] ) has an appealing simplicity , relating the pointer shift directly to the weak value . however",
    ", this formula only holds under the rather special assumption that the initial pointer wavefunction @xmath12 is a gaussian , or , more generally , is real and has zero mean .",
    "when @xmath12 is a completely general wavefunction , i.e. is allowed to take complex values and have any mean value @xcite , equation ( [ qclassic ] ) is replaced by @xmath13 where , for any pointer variable @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the initial expected value @xmath16 of @xmath14 ; so for instance @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the means of the initial pointer position and momentum , respectively .",
    "( again , this formula ignores terms of order @xmath7 or higher . )",
    "equation ( [ complex - version ] ) seems to have lost the simplicity of ( [ qclassic ] ) , but we can rewrite it as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and equation ( [ firstxi ] ) is then closer to the form of ( [ qclassic ] ) . as will become clear , this is part of a general pattern .",
    "one can also weakly measure several observables , @xmath21 , in succession @xcite .",
    "here one couples pointers at several locations and times during the evolution of the system , taking the coupling constant @xmath22 at site @xmath23 to be small .",
    "one then measures each pointer , and takes the product of the positions @xmath24 of the pointers . for two observables , and in the special case where the initial pointer distributions are real and have zero mean , e.g. a gaussian , one finds @xcite @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ignoring terms in higher powers of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the _ sequential weak value _ defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a unitary taking the system from the initial state @xmath0 to the first weak measurement , @xmath31 describes the evolution between the two measurements , and @xmath32 takes the system to the final state .",
    "( note the reverse order of operators in @xmath33 , which reflects the order in which they are applied . )",
    "if we drop the assumption about the special initial form of the pointer distribution and allow an arbitrary @xmath12 , then the counterpart of ( [ abmean ] ) becomes extremely complicated : see appendix , equation [ horrible ] .    even the comparatively simple formula ( [ abmean ] ) is not quite ideal .",
    "by analogy with ( [ qclassic ] ) we would hope for a formula of the form @xmath34 , but there is an extra term @xmath35 . what we seek",
    ", therefore , is a relationship that has some of the formal simplicity of ( [ qclassic ] ) and furthermore preserves its form for all measurement conditions .",
    "it turns out that this is possible if we take the _ cumulant _ of the expectations of pointer positions . as we shall see in the next section ,",
    "this is a certain sum of products of joint expectations of subsets of the @xmath36 , which we denote by @xmath37 . for a set of observables",
    ", we can define a formally equivalent expression using sequential weak values , which we denote by @xmath38 .",
    "then the claim is that , up to order @xmath39 in the coupling constants @xmath22 ( assumed to be all of the same approximate order of magnitude ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a factor dependent on the initial wavefunctions for each pointer . equation ( [ cumulant - equation ] ) holds for any initial pointer wavefunction , though different wavefunctions produce different values of @xmath41 .",
    "the remarkable thing is that all the complexity is packed into this one number , rather than exploding into a multiplicity of terms , as in ( [ horrible ] ) .",
    "note also that ( [ firstxi ] ) has essentially the same form as ( [ cumulant - equation ] ) since , in the case @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "however , there is an extra term @xmath44 in ( [ firstxi ] ) ; this arises because the cumulant for @xmath42 is anomalous in that its terms do not sum to zero .",
    "given a collection of random variables , such as the pointer positions @xmath36 , the cumulant @xmath45 is a polynomial in the expectations of subsets of these variables @xcite ; it has the property that it vanishes whenever the set of variables @xmath36 can be divided into two independent subsets .",
    "one can say that the cumulant , in a certain sense , picks out the maximal correlation involving all of the variables .",
    "we introduce some notation to define the cumulant .",
    "let @xmath14 be a subset of the integers @xmath46 .",
    "we write @xmath47 for @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the size of @xmath14 and the indices of the @xmath3 s in the product run over all the integers @xmath50 in @xmath14 .",
    "then the cumulant is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 runs over all partitions of the integers @xmath46 and the coefficient @xmath53 is given by @xmath54    for @xmath42 we have @xmath55 , and for @xmath56 @xmath57    there is an inverse operation for the cumulant @xcite :    [ anti ] @xmath58    to see that this equation holds , we must show that the term @xmath59 obtained by expanding the right - hand side is zero unless @xmath60 is the partition consisting of the single set @xmath46 . replacing each subset @xmath61 by the integer @xmath62 , this is equivalent to @xmath63 , where the sum is over all partitions of @xmath64 by subsets of sizes @xmath65 and the @xmath66 s are given by ( [ coefficients ] ) . in this sum",
    "we distinguish partitions with distinct integers ; e.g. @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "there are @xmath69 such distinct partitions with subset sizes @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of @xmath23 s equal to @xmath72 , so our sum may be rewritten as @xmath73 , where the sum is now over partitions in the standard sense @xcite .",
    "this is @xmath74 times the coefficient of @xmath75 in @xmath76 thus the sum is zero except for @xmath77 , which corresponds to the single - set partition @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath46 can be written as the disjoint union of two subsets @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we say the variables corresponding to these subsets are independent if @xmath80 for any subsets @xmath81 .",
    "we now prove the characteristic property of cumulants :    [ indep - lemma ] the cumulant vanishes if its arguments can be divided into two independent subsets .    for @xmath56",
    "this follows at once from ( [ q2 ] ) and ( [ indep ] ) , and we continue by induction . from ( [ anticumulant ] ) and the inductive assumption for @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 this holds because any term on the right - hand side of ( [ anticumulant ] ) vanishes when any subset of the partition @xmath60 includes elements of both @xmath78 and @xmath79 . using ( [ anticumulant ] ) again",
    ", this implies @xmath84 and by independence , @xmath85 .",
    "thus the inductive assumption holds for @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , the coefficients @xmath53 in ( [ cumulant ] ) are uniquely determined to have the form ( [ coefficients ] ) by the requirement that the cumulant vanishes when the variables form two independent subsets @xcite .    for @xmath56 ,",
    "the cumulant ( [ q2 ] ) is just the covariance , @xmath86 , and the same is true for @xmath87 , namely @xmath88 . for @xmath89",
    ", however , there is a surprise .",
    "the covariance is given by @xmath90 where the sums include all distinct combinations of indices , but the cumulant is @xmath91 which includes terms like @xmath92 that do not occur in the covariance .",
    "note that , if the subsets @xmath93 and @xmath94 are independent , the covariance does not vanish , since independence implies we can write the first term in ( [ 4covariance ] ) as @xmath95 and there is no cancelling term .",
    "however , as we have seen , the cumulant does contain such a term , and it is a pleasant exercise to check that the whole cumulant vanishes .",
    "to carry out a sequential weak measurement , one starts a system in an initial state @xmath0 , then weakly couples pointers at several times @xmath96 during the evolution of the system , and finally post - selects the system state @xmath1 .",
    "one then measures the pointers and finally takes the product of the values obtained from these pointer measurements .",
    "it is assumed that one can repeat the whole process many times to obtain the expectation of the product of pointer values .",
    "if one measures pointer positions @xmath24 , for instance , one can estimate @xmath97 , but one could also measure the momenta of the pointers to estimate @xmath98 .    if the coupling for the @xmath23th pointer is given by @xmath99 , and if the individual initial pointer wavefunctions are gaussian , or , more generally , are real with zero mean , then it turns out @xcite that these expectations can be expressed in terms of sequential weak values of order @xmath39 or less . here",
    "the sequential weak value of order @xmath39 , @xmath100 , is defined by @xmath101 where @xmath102 defines the evolution of the system between the measurements of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "when the @xmath105 are projectors , @xmath106 , we can write the sequential weak value as @xcite @xmath107 which shows that , in this case , the weak values has a natural interpretation as the amplitude for following the path defined by the @xmath108 .",
    "figure [ cumulant ] shows an example taken from @xcite where the path ( labelled by 1 and 2 successively ) is a route taken by a photon through a pair of interferometers , starting by injecting the photon at the top left ( with state @xmath109 ) and ending with post - selection by detection at the bottom right ( with final state @xmath110 ) .    in the last section ,",
    "the cumulant was defined for expectations of products of variables .",
    "one can define the cumulant for other entities by formal analogy ; for instance for density matrices @xcite , or hypergraphs @xcite .",
    "we can do the same for sequential weak values , defining the cumulant by ( [ cumulant ] ) with @xmath111 replaced by @xmath112 , where the arrow indicates that the indices , which run over the subset @xmath61 , are arranged in ascending order from right to left . for example , for @xmath42 , @xmath113 , and for @xmath89 @xmath114 there is a notion of independence that parallels ( [ indep ] ) : given a disjoint partition @xmath115 such that @xmath116 for any subsets @xmath81 , then we say the observables labelled by the two subsets are _",
    "weakly independent_. there is then an analogue of lemma [ indep - lemma ] :    the cumulant @xmath117 vanishes if the @xmath105 are weakly independent for some subsets @xmath78 , @xmath79 .    as an example of this , if one is given a bipartite system @xmath118 , and initial and final states that factorise as @xmath119 and @xmath120 , then observables on the @xmath10- and @xmath121-parts of the system are clearly weakly independent .",
    "another class of examples comes from what one might describe as a `` bottleneck '' construction , where , at some point the evolution of the system is divided into two parts by a one - dimensional projector ( the bottleneck ) and its complement , and the post - selection excludes the complementary part .",
    "then , if all the measurements before the projector belong to @xmath78 and all those after the projector belong to @xmath79 , the two sets are weakly independent .",
    "this follows because we can write @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the part of @xmath124 lying in the post - selected subspace . as an illustration of this ,",
    "suppose we add a connecting link ( figure [ bottleneckfig ] , `` @xmath125 '' ) between the two interferometers in figure [ cumulantfig ] , so @xmath126 , the bottleneck , is the projection onto @xmath125 , and post - selection discards the part of the wavefunction corresponding to the path @xmath127",
    ". then measurements at ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' are weakly independent ; in fact @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "note that the same measurements are _ not _ independent in the double interferometer of figure [ cumulantfig ] , where @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and yet , surprisingly , @xmath133 , @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath39 system observables @xmath21 .",
    "suppose @xmath134 , for @xmath135 , are observables of the @xmath23th pointer , namely hermitian functions @xmath136 of pointer position @xmath24 and momentum @xmath137 , and the interaction hamiltonian for the weak measurement of system observable @xmath105 is @xmath138 , where @xmath22 is a small coupling constant ( all @xmath22 being assumed of the same order of magnitude @xmath2 ) .",
    "suppose further that the pointer observables @xmath139 are measured after the coupling .",
    "let @xmath140 be the @xmath23-th pointer s initial wave - function .",
    "for any variable @xmath108 associated to the @xmath23-th pointer , write @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "we are now almost ready to state the main theorem , but first need to clarify the measurement procedure .",
    "when we evaluate expectations of products of the @xmath139 for different sets of pointers , for instance when we evaluate @xmath143 , we have a choice .",
    "we could either couple the entire set of @xmath39 pointers and then select the data for pointers 1 and 2 to get @xmath143 . or we could carry out an experiment in which we couple just pointers 1 and 2 to give @xmath143 .",
    "these procedures give different answers .",
    "for instance , if we couple three pointers and measure pointers 1 and 2 to get @xmath143 , in addition to the terms in @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath144 we also get terms in @xmath145 and @xmath146 involving the observable @xmath147 .",
    "this means we get a different cumulant @xmath148 , depending on the procedure used . in what follows ,",
    "we regard each expectation as being evaluated in a separate experiment , with only the relevant pointers coupled .",
    "it will be shown elsewhere that , with the alternative definition , the theorem still holds but with a different value of the constant @xmath41 .",
    "[ main - theorem ] for @xmath149 , for any pointer observables @xmath139 and @xmath134 , and for any initial pointer wavefunctions @xmath140 , up to total order @xmath39 in the @xmath22 , @xmath150 where @xmath41 ( sometimes written more explicitly as @xmath151 ) is given by @xmath152 for @xmath42 the same result holds , but with the extra term @xmath153 : @xmath154    we use the methods of @xcite to calculate the expectations of products of pointer variables for sequential weak measurements .",
    "let the initial and final states of the system be @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "consider some subset @xmath155 of @xmath46 , with @xmath156 .",
    "the state of the system and the pointers @xmath157 after the coupling of those pointers is @xmath158 and following post - selection by the system state @xmath1 , the state of the pointers is @xmath159 expanding each exponential , we have @xmath160 where @xmath161 are integers , @xmath162 means that @xmath163 for @xmath164 , and @xmath165 let us write ( [ sumratio ] ) as @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 denotes the index set @xmath169 , etc .. define @xmath170 then @xmath171 set @xmath172 , where @xmath60 in the product ranges over all distinct subsets of the integers @xmath173 .",
    "then @xmath174 is an ( infinite ) weighted sum of terms @xmath175 where @xmath176 denotes the set of all the index sets that occur in @xmath177 .",
    "the strategy is to show that , when the size of the index set @xmath178 is less than @xmath39 , the coefficient of @xmath177 vanishes ; by ( [ alpha ] ) this implies that all coefficients of order less than @xmath39 in @xmath2 vanish .",
    "we then look at the index sets of size @xmath39 , corresponding to terms of order @xmath179 , and show that the relevant terms sum up to the right - hand side of ( [ main - result ] ) .",
    "but if @xmath180 for some x , then we also have @xmath181 , since @xmath182 .",
    "let @xmath183 be a partition of @xmath46 .",

    "the coefficient of @xmath177 in @xmath174 is zero if all the index sets in @xmath178 have a zero at some position @xmath184 .",
    "if we expand @xmath174 using ( [ cxy2 ] ) , each term in this expansion is associated with a partition @xmath60 of @xmath197 .",
    "let @xmath60 be a valid partition for @xmath178 , and let @xmath198 denote the partition derived from @xmath60 by removing @xmath184 from the subset @xmath187 that contains it , and deleting that subset if it contains only @xmath184 .",
    "then the following partitions include @xmath60 and are all valid : @xmath199 each partition @xmath200 , for @xmath201 contributes @xmath196 to the coefficient of @xmath177 in @xmath202 , and since this term has coefficient @xmath203 in ( [ cxy2 ] ) for partitions @xmath204 , and @xmath205 for @xmath206 , the sum of all contributions is zero .    from equations ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ index ] ) , the power of @xmath2 in the term @xmath177 is @xmath207 .",
    "this , together with the preceding lemma , implies that the lowest order non - vanishing terms in @xmath174 are @xmath177 s that have a 1 occurring once and once only in each position ; we call these _ complete lowest - degree _ terms .",
    "[ one - index - set ] the coefficient of a complete lowest - degree term @xmath177 in @xmath174 is zero unless only one of the four classes of indices in @xmath178 , viz .",
    "@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 or @xmath211 , has non - zero terms .",
    "consider first the case where the indices in @xmath209 and @xmath211 are zero , and where both @xmath208 and @xmath210 have some non - zero indices .",
    "let @xmath212 be the partition whose subsets consists of the non - zero positions in index sets @xmath213 in @xmath208 , and let @xmath214 be some partition of the remaining integers in @xmath46 .",
    "suppose @xmath215 .",
    "then we can construct a set of partitions by mixing @xmath60 and @xmath216 ; these have the form @xmath217 where each @xmath218 is either empty or consists of some @xmath219 , and all the subsets @xmath219 are present once only in the partition .",
    "if any @xmath220 is eligible , all the other mixtures will also be eligible .",
    "furthermore , the set of all eligible partitions can be decomposed into non - overlapping subsets of mixtures obtained in this way .",
    "any mixture @xmath220 gives the same value of @xmath221 , which we denote simply by @xmath222 ; so to show that all the contributions to the coefficient of @xmath177 cancel , we have only to sum over all the mixtures , weighting a partition with @xmath6 subsets by @xmath223 .",
    "this gives @xmath224    the above argument applies equally well to the situation where @xmath208 and @xmath211 both have some non - zero indices and indices in @xmath209 and @xmath210 are zero .",
    "if the non - zero indices are present in @xmath208 and @xmath209 , we can take any eligible partition @xmath225 and divide each subset @xmath53 into two subsets @xmath226 and @xmath227 with the indices from @xmath208 in @xmath226 and those from @xmath209 in @xmath227 .",
    "all the mixtures of type ( [ mix ] ) are eligible , and they include the original partition @xmath228 . by the above argument , the coefficients of @xmath177 arising from them sum to zero .",
    "other combinations of indices are dealt with similarly .",
    "note that , for @xmath89 and for the index sets @xmath229 and @xmath230 , the `` mixture '' argument shows that coefficient of @xmath177 coming from @xmath231 cancels that coming from @xmath232 to give zero .",
    "this cancellation occurs with the cumulant ( [ 4cumulant ] ) , but not with the covariance ( [ 4covariance ] ) , where the term @xmath232 is absent .",
    "the only terms that need to be considered , therefore , are complete lowest - degree terms with non - zero indices only in one of the sets @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",

    "so , summing over all @xmath177 with indices in @xmath208 , one obtains @xmath235 .",
    "similarly , from ( [ alpha ] ) , ( [ u ] ) and ( [ v ] ) , summing over the @xmath177 with indices in @xmath209 gives the complex conjugate of @xmath236 .",

    "the rest of @xmath41 comes from the index sets @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "however , the sum of the coefficients of @xmath177 for the same index set in @xmath208 and @xmath210 is zero .",
    "this is true because , for any complete lowest degree index set , the sum of coefficients for all @xmath177 with the indices divided in any manner between @xmath208 and @xmath210 is zero , being the number ways of obtaining that index set from @xmath238 times @xmath239 .",
    "but by lemma [ one - index - set ] , the coefficient of @xmath177 is zero unless the index set comes wholly from @xmath208 or @xmath210 .",
    "now ( [ z ] ) , ( [ x ] ) and ( [ y ] ) tell us that , for an index set in @xmath210 , @xmath240 and from the above argument , this appears appears in @xmath241 with coefficient @xmath242 .",
    "again , the index sets in @xmath211 give the complex conjugate of those in @xmath210 .",
    "thus we obtain the remaining half of @xmath41 , which proves ( [ main - result ] ) for @xmath149 .",
    "for @xmath42 the constant terms ( of order zero in @xmath2 ) in @xmath243 do not vanish , but the proof goes through if we consider @xmath244 instead .",

    "we take @xmath246 throughout this section , so @xmath247 . then ( [ main - result1 ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) give @xmath248 which we have already seen as equations ( [ firstxi ] ) and ( [ xi1 ] ) . if we measure the pointer momentum , so @xmath249 , we find @xmath250 which is equivalent to the result obtained in @xcite .    for two variables ,",
    "our theorem for @xmath251 , is @xmath252 with @xmath253 the calculations in the appendix allow one to check ( [ qq ] ) and ( [ xiqq ] ) by explicit evaluation ; see ( [ explicit ] ) .",

    "each formula contains on the right - hand side a leading sequential weak value , but there are also extra terms , such as @xmath263 in ( [ 2q ] ) and @xmath264 in ( [ 3q ] ) .",
    "all these extra terms are eliminated when the cumulant is calculated , and we are left with ( [ main - result ] ) with @xmath265 .",
    "this gratifying simplification depends on the fact that the cumulant is a sum over all partitions .",
    "for instance , it does not occur if one uses the covariance instead of the cumulant . to see this ,",
    "look at the case @xmath89 : the term @xmath266 in @xmath267 , the covariance of pointer positions , gives rise via ( [ 4q ] ) to weak value terms like @xmath268 .",
    "however , ( [ 4covariance ] ) together with ( [ 2q ] ) , ( [ 3q ] ) and ( [ 4q ] ) show that @xmath267 has no other terms that generate any multiple of @xmath268 , and consequently this weak value expression can not be cancelled and must be present in @xmath267 .",
    "this means that there can not be any equation relating @xmath267 and @xmath269 .",
    "this negative conclusion does not apply to the cumulant @xmath270 , as this includes terms such as @xmath271 ; see ( [ 4cumulant ] ) .",
    "we have treated the interactions between each pointer and the system individually , the hamiltonian for the @xmath23th pointer and system being @xmath272 , but of course we can equivalently describe the interaction between all the pointers and the system by @xmath273 . for sequential measurements we implicitly assume that all the times @xmath96 are distinct . however , the limiting case where there is no evolution between coupling of the pointers and all the @xmath96 s are equal is of interest , and is the _ simultaneous _ weak measurement considered in @xcite . in this case",
    ", the state of the pointers after post - selection is given by @xmath274 the exponential @xmath275 here differs from the sequential expression @xmath276 in ( [ bigstate ] ) in that each term in the expansion of the latter appears with the operators in a specific order , viz .",
    "the arrow order @xmath277 as in ( [ 4weak ] ) , whereas in the expansion of the former the same term is replaced by a symmetrised sum over all orderings of operators .",
    "for instance , for arbitrary operators @xmath278 , @xmath279 and @xmath280 , the third degree terms in @xmath281 include @xmath282 , @xmath283 and @xmath284 , whose counterparts in @xmath285 are , respectively , @xmath282 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "apart from this symmetrisation , the calculations in section [ theorem - section ] can be carried through unchanged for simultaneous measurement . thus if we replace the sequential weak value by the _",
    "simultaneous weak value _",
    "@xcite @xmath288 where the sum on the right - hand side includes all possible orders of applying the operators , we obtain a version of theorem [ main - theorem ] for simultaneous weak measurement : @xmath289 likewise , relations such ( [ 2q ] ) , ( [ 3q ] ) , etc . ,",
    "hold with simultaneous weak values in place of the sequential weak values ; indeed , these relations were first proved for simultaneous measurement @xcite .    from ( [ swv ] )",
    "we see that , when the operators @xmath105 all commute , the sequential and simultaneous weak values coincide",
    ". one important instance of this arises when the operators @xmath105 are applied to distinct subsystems , as in the case of the simultaneous weak measurements of the electron and positron in hardy s paradox @xcite .",
    "when the operators do not commute , the meaning of simultaneous weak measurement is not so obvious .",
    "one possible physical interpretation follows from the well - known formula @xmath290 and its analogues for more operators .",
    "suppose two pointers , one for @xmath291 and one for @xmath292 , are coupled alternately in a sequence of @xmath293 short intervals ( figure [ alternate ] , top diagram ) with coupling strength @xmath294 for each interval .",
    "this is an enlarged sense of sequential weak measurement @xcite in which the same pointer is used repeatedly , coherently preserving its state between couplings .",
    "the state after post - selection is @xmath295 from ( [ formula ] ) we deduce that @xmath296 this picture readily extends to more operators @xmath105 .",
    "one can also simulate a simultaneous measurement by averaging the results of a set of sequential measurements with the operators in all orders ; in effect , one carries out a set of experiments that implement the averaging in ( [ swv ] ) .",
    "there is then no single act that counts as simultaneous measurement , but weak measurement in any case relies on averaging many repeats of experiments in order to extract the signal from the noise . in a certain sense , therefore , sequential measurement includes and extends the concept of simultaneous measurement .",
    "however , if we wish to accomplish simultaneous measurement in a single act , then we need a broader concept of weak measurement where pointers can be re - used ; indeed , we can go further , and consider generalised weak coupling between one time - evolving system and another , followed by measurement of the second system . however , even in this case , the measurement results can be expressed algebraically in terms of the sequential weak values of the first system @xcite .",
    "lundeen and resch @xcite showed that , for a gaussian initial pointer wavefunction , if one defines an operator @xmath228 by @xmath297 then the relationship @xmath298 holds .",
    "they argued that @xmath299 can be interpreted physically as a lowering operator , carrying the pointer from its first excited state @xmath300 , in number state notation , to the gaussian state @xmath301 ( despite the fact that the pointer is not actually in a harmonic potential ) .",
    "although @xmath299 is not an observable , @xmath302 can be regarded as a prescription for combining expecations of pointer position and momentum to get the weak value .    if instead of @xmath299 one takes @xmath303 then the even simpler relationship @xmath304 holds .",
    "we refer to @xmath228 as a generalised lowering operator .",
    "lundeen and resch also extended their lowering operator concept to simultaneous weak measurement of several observables @xmath105 .",
    "rephrased in terms of our generalised lowering operators @xmath53 defined by ( [ gaussian ] ) , their finding @xcite can be stated as @xmath305 this is of interest for two reasons .",
    "first , the entire simultaneous weak value appears on the right - hand side , not just its real part ; and second , the `` extra terms '' in the simultaneous analogues of ( [ 2q ] ) , ( [ 3q ] ) and ( [ 4q ] ) have disappeared .",
    "the lowering operator seems to relate directly to weak values .",
    "we can generalise these ideas in two ways .",
    "first , we extend them from simultaneous to sequential weak measurements .",
    "secondly , instead of assuming the initial pointer wavefunction is a gaussian , we allow it be arbitrary ; we do this by defining a generalised lowering operator @xmath306 for a gaussian @xmath12 , @xmath307 , so the above definition reduces to ( [ gaussian ] ) in this case . in general , however , @xmath12 will not be annihilated by @xmath228 and is therefore not the number state @xmath301 ( this state is a gaussian with complex variance @xmath308 ) .",
    "nonetheless , there is an analogue of theorem [ main - theorem ] in which the whole sequential weak value , rather than its real part , appears :    [ lowering - theorem ] for @xmath309 @xmath310 where @xmath311 is given by @xmath312 for @xmath42 the same result holds , but with the extra term @xmath313 : @xmath314    put @xmath315 , @xmath316",
    ". then @xmath317,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used theorem [ main - theorem ] to get the last line , and where @xmath311 is given by ( [ constant ] ) and @xmath318 by @xmath319 ( note the bar over @xmath320 that is absent in the definition of @xmath311 by ( [ constant ] ) ) .",
    "we want to prove @xmath321 , and to do this it suffices to prove that the complex conjugate of the numerator is zero , i.e. @xmath322 let @xmath323 , @xmath324 , @xmath325 , @xmath326 .",
    "using the definition of @xmath41 in ( [ xi ] ) , the above equation can be written @xmath327    suppose the interaction hamiltonian has the standard von neumann form @xmath328 , so @xmath247 in the definition of @xmath41 by equation ( [ xi ] ) .",
    "then for @xmath42 , since @xmath329 and @xmath330 , @xmath331 , so we get the even simpler result @xmath332 this is valid for all initial pointer wavefunctions , and therefore extends lundeen and resch s equation ( [ lr1 ] ) .",
    "it seems almost too simple : there is no factor corresponding to @xmath41 in equation ( [ qmean ] ) .",
    "however , a dependency on the initial pointer wavefunction is of course built into the definition of @xmath228 through @xmath333 .    for @xmath309",
    "it is no longer true that @xmath334 , even with the standard interaction hamiltonian .",
    "however , if in addition @xmath335 , then @xmath336 thus @xmath337 for all @xmath39 . applying the inverse operation for the cumulant , given by propostion [ anti ] , we deduce :    if @xmath338 , e.g. if the initial pointer wavefunction @xmath12 is real , then for @xmath309 @xmath339    this is the sequential weak value version of the result for simultaneous measurements , ( [ simul ] ) , but is more general than the gaussian case treated in @xcite .",
    "we might be tempted to try to repeat the above argument for pointer positions @xmath24 instead of the lowering operators @xmath53 by applying the anti - cumulant to both sides of ( [ main - result ] ) .",
    "this fails , however , because of the need to take the real part of the weak values ; in fact , this is one way of seeing where the extra terms come from in ( [ 2q ] ) , ( [ 3q ] ) and ( [ 4q ] ) and their higher analogues .",
    "note also that ( [ nice ] ) does not hold for general @xmath12 , since then different subsets of indices may have different values of @xmath311 .",
    "the procedure for sequential weak measurement involves coupling pointers at several stages during the evolution of the system , measuring the position ( or some other observable ) of each pointer , and then multiplying the measured values together .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that we would really like to measure the product of the values of the operators @xmath340 , and that this corresponds to the sequential weak value @xmath341 .",
    "multiplication of the values of pointer observables is the best we can do to achieve this goal .",
    "however , this brings along extra terms , such as @xmath342 in ( [ 2q ] ) , which are an artefact of this method of extracting information . from this perspective",
    ", the cumulant extracts the information we really want .    in @xcite ,",
    "a somewhat idealised measuring device was being considered , where the pointer position distribution is real and has zero mean . when the pointer distribution is allowed to be arbitrary ,",
    "the expressions for @xmath97 become wildly complicated ( see for instance ( [ horrible ] ) ) . yet",
    "the cumulant of these terms condenses into the succinct equation ( [ main - result ] ) with all the complexity hidden away in the one number @xmath41 .",
    "why does the cumulant have this property ?    recall that the cumulant vanishes when its variables belong to two independent sets .",
    "the product of the pointer positions @xmath343 will include terms that come from products of disjoint subsets of these pointer positions , and the cumulant of these terms will be sent to zero , by lemma [ indep - lemma ] .",
    "for instance , with @xmath56 , the pointers are deflected in proportion to their individual weak values , according to ( [ firstxi ] ) , and the cumulant subtracts this component leaving only the component that arises from the @xmath344-influence of the weak measurement of @xmath291 on that of @xmath292 .",
    "the subtraction of this component corresponds to the subtraction of the term @xmath345 from ( [ 2q ] ) . in general",
    ", the cumulant of pointer positions singles out the maximal correlation involving all the @xmath36 , and the theorem tells us that this is directly related to the corresponding `` maximal correlation '' of sequential weak values , @xmath346 , which involves all the operators .",
    "in fact , the theorem tells us something stronger : that it does not matter what pointer observable @xmath347 we measure , e.g. position , momentum , or some hermitian combination of them , and that likewise the coupling of the pointer with the system can be via a hamiltonian @xmath348 with any hermitian @xmath349 .",
    "different choices of @xmath184 and @xmath350 lead only to a different multiplicative constant @xmath41 in front of @xmath117 in ( [ main - result ] ) .",
    "we always extract the same function of sequential weak values , @xmath351 , from the system .",
    "this argues both for the fundamental character of sequential weak values and also for the key role played by their cumulants .",
    "i am indebted to j. berg for many discussions and for comments on drafts of this paper ; i thank him particularly for putting me on the track of cumulants .",
