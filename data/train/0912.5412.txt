    "x - ray binary systems in which the compact object is thought to be a black hole from dynamical or x - ray timing evidence ( black hole candidates , or bhc , see remillard &  mcclintock 2006 ) are often found to shift between spectral states distinguished by hardness and intensity at x - rays and @xmath5-rays ( grove et al .",

    "1993 ) .",
    "cygnus x-1 is unusual in that it is persistently bright in x - rays and has a high mass donor star , hde  226868 , with mass 18 - 40  m@xmath6 ( zilkowski 2005 ; tarasov et al .",
    "2003 ; caballero - nieves et al . 2009 ) and accretes primarily from a stellar wind .",

    "no pulsations or bursts have ever been detected .",
    "the strong stellar wind of the donor star , and its complex interaction with the compact object , can be studied through the uv p - cygni lines and x - ray absorption ( refs ) .",

    "gies  et al .",
    "find that @xmath10 is lower during the soft / high state and suggest that in this state , the x - rays ionize the wind to a greater extent and slow its acceleration . as a result , the black hole can accrete more matter and the total x - ray luminosity increases .    spectra obtained with the _ chandra _",
    "high energy transmission gratings suggest that the stellar wind increases in density towards the compact object .",

    "we apply the lomb normalized periodogram ( scargle 1982 ) and the analysis of variance ( anova , davies 1991 ) methods to search for periodicity in the rxte asm observations of cyg  x-1 .",

    "as with the power spectral methods , the anova method may return a false positive in a test for periodicity if the power spectrum contains a significant continuum component , and the significance given by this method may be an overestimate .",
    "we have found a clear orbital variation in the hardness ratio hr  1 , but not in the individual energy bands in the same period ( `` soft 3 '' ) .",
    "the count rates in the individual energy bands are more variable on all timescales than hr1 . for example , during soft  3 , the @xmath35 fit for a constant count rate in the 1.5 - 3  kev range is @xmath36 with 6037 degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath35 fit for a constant hr  1 is 7.1 . as a result of this greater non - orbital variability",
    ", it may be harder to detect any orbital variation in the actual count rates than in hr1 , which may increase near @xmath0 with the absorbing column , but which may be less affected by flares than the count rates .",
    "if the soft  3 orbital variation is @xmath37 significant , then scaling from the duration of the observations , the soft  1 and soft  2 variability should be @xmath38 significant and the soft  5 variability should be @xmath39 significant .",

    "the rms variation in the 3 x - ray bands and 2 hardness ratios are within a factor of 2 for all the soft states , except for hr2 in soft  2 , which appears anomalously high .",
    "we also tested whether the hr1 variability seen during the soft  3 period would appear significant in shorter intervals of that same period .",
    "lomb normalized periodograms of the first or middle 200 days of soft  3 show no significant variation at the orbital period , though the power spectrum of the last 200 days shows a peak as great as for the total soft  3 period .",
    "there was no significant variation in hr1 in the first 100 days of soft  3 , or in days 190 through 290 , but within the last 100 days the power spectral peak reached 65 .",

    "intervals of 200 days , 100 days , and 50 days are identical to the lengths of the soft  1 , soft  4 , and soft  2 periods , respectively . in conclusion",
    ", it is possible that orbital variability as strong as that seen during the soft  3 state could occur during all soft states but went undetected by rxte / asm during the shorter soft  1 , soft  2 , soft  4 , and soft  5 states .    in figures  3 to 7",
    ", we present light curves and hardness ratios during the soft states 1 to 5 , folded with the 5.6  day binary period .",
    "we have demonstrated with both power spectra and epoch folding methods that the hardness ratio and count rate show the 5.6  day orbital periodicity during the soft  3 state . however , previous studies of dips in the hard state have suggested that discrete dips may occur at any phase , but may simply be more likely to occur near @xmath0 .",
    "cyg x-1 shows both dips in which the spectrum hardens ( color dips ) and also monochromatic dips ( count dips ) in which the count rate diminishes but the color does not change appreciably ( feng &  cui 2002 ) .",

    "the latter influences the x - rays only through compton scattering , as the wind outside of the dense clumps is entirely ionized .",
    "the results do not constrain @xmath10 very well , although at too high values , too great an orbital variation is seen .",
    "the covering fraction parameter serves as a time - average of the actual covering fraction during dips with the zero covering fraction in periods when dips are not present .",
    "we first fit the model to the asm light curves in the 1.53 , 35 , and 510 kev bands during the hard state .",
    "we define the hard state as the entire light curve excluding the soft states identified in table  1 .",
    "this may include some `` failed transistions '' to the soft state , or intermediate states .",
    "the best - fit values for the smooth wind model are @xmath97  m@xmath98  yr@xmath2 and @xmath99  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "for the computation of @xmath35 , we use errors for the binned light curve based on the variance within each bin .",
    "we also try fits to the hardness ratio hr1 ( flux in the 35 kev band divided by flux in the 1.53 kev band ) . for the hard state , the dense clump model using partial covering and the smooth partially ionized wind model fit the data equally well .",
    "we apply again the model of absorption in a partially ionized smooth wind but now to the `` soft  3 '' period .",
    "the strong orbital variation in hr1 is better explained by a neutral absorber than by a smooth partially ionized wind .",
    "the values of @xmath10 and @xmath81 which provide the best fit to the variations in 1.53 , 35 , and 510  kev bands predict a 3.6%   peak to peak variation in hr1 , whereas an 11%  variation is actually observed .",
    "a neutral absorber would absorb most strongly the soft x - rays , thus increasing the variation in hr1 .    for the neutral clump model ,",
    "the free parameters are the covering fraction and @xmath10 in the fully ionized remainder of the wind , which affects the fit only through the variable column for compton scattering . for the 1.53 , 35 , and 510 kev bands",
    ", we obtain @xmath100 at a covering fraction of 0.14 , while for hr1 we obtain @xmath101 at a covering fraction of 0.28 .",
    "the larger covering fraction required to fit the hardness ratio is consistent with the hardness ratio giving a wider variation than expected from the variation in the individual bands .",
    "that the covering fractions differ in the fits to the individual energy bands and to the hardness ratio may indicate a deficiency in the model .",
    "the @xmath35 values for the partial covering neutral clump model are comparable but slightly superior to the @xmath35 values for the smooth partially ionized wind absorption model .",
    "we are able to set some broad limits on how the mass - loss rate and x - ray luminosity may vary between the hard and soft states .",
    "consistent with the earlier results of gies et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the limit that we have set on the wind mass - loss rate in the soft state ( @xmath92 ) is lower than the limit on the mass - loss rate in the hard state ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "however , the models make many simplifications and the wind in cyg  x-1 is probably complex and aspherical .",
    "the x - ray dips seen in cyg  x-1 may be caused by high density regions of the wind passing through the line of sight .",
    "the wind density could be increased locally from some interaction between the wind and the compact object or globally from instabilities common to the radiative acceleration of o  star winds .",
    "density contrasts of @xmath102 are commonly seen in simulations of o  star wind acceleration ( owocki , castor , &  rybicki 1988 ) . from the duration of the observed dips , @xmath103",
    ", the clumps would have linear size @xmath104  cm , given that the compact object moves with velocity @xmath105  km  s@xmath2 and wind velocities are typically @xmath106  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "for a density contrast of 10@xmath107 , a typical spherical region of radius @xmath108  cm would contain one absorbing clump of radius @xmath109  cm .",
    "we assume that the wind outside of the clump does not contribute to absorbing dips .",
    "there would be @xmath110 absorbing clumps within a stellar radius , each clump presenting @xmath111 of the surface area of the surrounding @xmath108  cm radius sphere . thus we would expect a clump covering fraction of @xmath112 , which is consistent with the results of the simple models shown in table  2 .",
    "it has been suggested ( kaper et al . 1993 ) that the flares seen in some accreting binaries result from accretion of inhomogeneities in the stellar wind .",
    "if , as suggested above , a typical clump has radius 10@xmath113  cm and is overdense by a factor of @xmath102 , then it will provide a mass of @xmath114  g. with an accretion efficiency of 0.1 , this would provide a luminosity of @xmath115  erg  s@xmath2 over a period of 100  s , consistent with observed flares .",
    "however , this analysis does not explain the dependence of flaring on x - ray state .",
    "our suggestion that the wind mass - loss rate @xmath10 is greater during the hard - low state appears to be inconsistent with increased flaring during the soft - high state .",
    "ducci et al .",
    "( 2009 ) modeled the accretion of clumps in the winds of supergiant high mass x - ray binaries and showed that a greater @xmath10 should lead to brighter flares .",
    "however , the flares also depend on the distribution of clump size , as well as other wind parameters that may change between the two states .",
    "if a focused wind is present and resolved into clumps with the parameters we have described , there may be observable implications for the uv p  cygni lines .",
    "the clump covering fraction for the o  star may be less than that for the black hole as a result of the orbital inclination . whereas the wind outside of the clumps will be mostly ionized to stages higher than and by x - ray illumination",
    ", we expect that most of the n in the clumps will be at lower ionization stages than , as the higher density will reduce @xmath85 by 3 . as a result",
    ", the clumps may not contribute to the profiles of the @xmath116  doublet .",
    "however , may be the dominant ionization stage of si in the clumps , and thus an absorption component of depth @xmath117% , limited by the covering fraction , could persist at @xmath15 in the @xmath118  doublet .",
    "such an absorption feature varying between hard and soft states could not be ruled out by present uv observations .    in some models of the superfast x - ray transients ( sfxts , sguera et al .",
    "2005 ) , a new class of x - ray source discovered with integral , accretion of clumps from an ob  star wind play an important role ( walter &  zurita heras 2007 ) .",
    "the study of absorption dips reported here complements the active research on sfxts , whose compact objects may accrete from stellar winds at greater orbital distances .",
