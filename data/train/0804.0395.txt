    "in fact , if we consider initial data @xmath10 for @xmath11 , then we expect the solution to essentially remain the rightward propagating soliton @xmath12 until time @xmath13 at which point a substantial amount of mass `` sees '' the delta potential .",
    "it is of interest to examine the subsequent behavior of the solution , as this arises as a model problem in nonlinear optics and condensed matter physics ( see cao - malomed @xcite and goodman - holmes - weinstein @xcite ) . in the case",
    "@xmath14 , holmer - zworski @xcite find that the soliton remains intact and the evolution of the center of the soliton approximately obeys hamilton s equations of motion for a suitable effective hamiltonian .",

    "[ f : snapshots ] .",
    "the transmitted mass and reflected mass are determined as well as the detailed asymptotic form of the transmitted and reflected waves . the rigorous analysis in @xcite",
    "is rooted in the heuristic that at high velocities , the time of interaction of the solution with the delta potential is short , and thus the solution is well - approximated in @xmath23 by the solution to the corresponding linear problem @xmath24 this heuristic is typically valid provided the problem is @xmath23 subcritical with respect to scaling . in this case , it is shown to hold using strichartz estimates for solutions to this linear problem and its inhomogeneous counterpart , with bounds independent of @xmath25 . the strichartz estimates are also used in a perturbative analysis comparing the incoming solution ( pre - interaction ) and outgoing solution ( post - interaction ) with the solution to the free nls equation .",
    "one then proceeds with an analysis of the linear problem to understand the interaction .",
    "let @xmath26 and consider a general plane wave solution to @xmath27 , @xmath28 the matrix @xmath29 sending incoming ( @xmath30 ) coefficients to outgoing ( @xmath31 ) coefficients is called the scattering matrix , and in this case it can be easily computed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath35 we have that at high velocities and for @xmath36 , @xmath37 \\approx t(v)e^{-ith_0}[e^{ixv}{\\textnormal{sech}}(x - x_1 ) ] + r(v ) e^{-ith_0}[e^{-ixv}{\\textnormal{sech}}(x+x_1)].\\ ] ] from this we can infer that the transmitted mass @xmath38 matches the quantum transmission rate at velocity @xmath21 , i.e. the square of the transmission coefficient @xmath39 this is confirmed by a numerical analysis of this problem in holmer - marzuola - zworski @xcite , where it is reported that for @xmath40 fixed , @xmath41 further , gives approximately the form of the solution just after the interaction , and one can then model the post - interaction evolution by the free nonlinear equation and apply the inverse scattering method to yield a detailed asymptotic .",

    "however , the amount of mass trapped at the origin diminishes exponentially as @xmath50 and the observed mass of the transmitted and reflected waves is consistent with the assumption that the outgoing solution is still initially well - modelled by .    in this paper",
    ", we undertake a rigorous analysis of the @xmath16 and @xmath21 large case .",

    "interaction , and post - interaction perturbative analyses , this eigenstate must be separately analyzed .",
    "this introduces the most difficulty in the post - interaction analysis , although ( as explained in more detail below ) , we are able to obtain suitable estimates by introducing a more refined decomposition of the outgoing waves and invoking some nonlinear energy estimates . we thus obtain the following :    [ th:1 ] fix @xmath55 . if @xmath56 is the solution of with initial condition @xmath57 and @xmath58 , then for @xmath59 and @xmath60 we have @xmath61 uniformly for `` post - interaction '' times @xmath62 here the constant @xmath63 and the constants in @xmath64 are independent of @xmath65 , while @xmath66 is a constant depending on @xmath67 and @xmath68 which goes to infinity as @xmath69 or @xmath70 .    the proof is outlined in  [ proof ]",
    "it is decomposed into estimates for the pre - interaction phase ( phase 1 ) , interaction phase ( phase 2 ) , and post - interaction phase ( phase 3 ) .",
    "the details of the estimates for each of the phases are then given in ",

    "the assumption that @xmath71 is new to our @xmath16 analysis ; no assumption of this strength was required in the @xmath15 case treated in @xcite .",
    "it is needed in order to iterate over unit - sized time intervals in the post - interaction phase . the perturbative equation in that analysis",
    "has a forcing term whose size can be at most comparable to the size of the initial error .",
    "the condition that emerges is @xmath72 .",
    "since the error bestowed upon us from the interaction phase analysis is @xmath73 , the condition @xmath72 equates to @xmath71 .",
    "provided this condition is satisfied , we can interate over @xmath74 unit - sized time intervals , with the error bound doubling over each interval , and incur a loss of size @xmath75 .",
    "this enables us to reach time @xmath76 .",
    "the assumption @xmath71 is not a serious limitation , however , since the most interesting phenomenom ( even splitting or near even splitting ) occurs for @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , if the analysis is only carried through the interaction phase ( ending at time @xmath78 ) and no further , then only the assumption @xmath79 is needed .",
    "we believe that if our post - interaction arguments are amplified with a series of technical refinements , we could relax the restriction needed there from @xmath71 to @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , the condition @xmath79 shows up in a more serious way in the interaction analysis , and to relax this restriction even further ( if it is possible ) would require a more significant new idea .",
    "the condition @xmath79 comes about as a result of applying strichartz estimates to the flow @xmath80 rather than just to the dispersive part @xmath81 , and the additional error found in the @xmath16 case compared to the @xmath15 case arises in the same way . as discussed in theorem [ th:3 ] below , in the case",
    "@xmath15 we have @xmath82 in place of @xmath83 for @xmath16 ( which in the crucial regime @xmath84 becomes @xmath85 ) .",
    "however , the numerical study conducted in @xcite ( see equation ( 2.4 ) , table 2 , and fig .  5 in that paper ) suggests that the trapping at the origin should be exponentially small instead , indicating that this is probably only an artifact of our method of proof .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] is based entirely upon estimates for the perturbed and free linear propagators , and some nonlinear conservation laws ( energy and mass ) ; there is no use of the inverse scattering theory .",
    "however , as in @xcite , we can combine the inverse scattering theory with the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] to obtain a strengthened result giving more information about the behavior of the outgoing waves .",
    "this result we state as :    [ th:2 ] under the hypothesis of theorem [ th:1 ] and for @xmath86 we have @xmath87 & \\phi_0(|t_q(v)| ) e^{\\frac{1}{2}i|\\tilde t_q(v)|^2t}e^{i\\arg t_q(v ) } e^{ixv}e^{-itv^2}\\tilde t_q(v ) { \\textnormal{sech}}(\\tilde t_q(v)(x - x_0-tv))\\\\ & + \\phi_0(|r_q(v)| ) e^{\\frac{1}{2}i|\\tilde r_q(v)|^2t}e^{i\\arg r_q(v ) } e^{-ixv}e^{-itv^2}\\tilde r_q(v ) { \\textnormal{sech}}(\\tilde r_q(v)(x+x_0+tv))\\\\ & + \\mathcal{o}_{l_x^\\infty}\\left(\\left(t-\\frac{|x_0|}{v}\\right)^{-1/2}\\right ) + \\mathcal{o}_{l_x^2}(|q|^{\\frac13}v^{-\\frac76(1 - 2{\\varepsilon})})+\\mathcal{o}(v^{-1 + 2{\\varepsilon } } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88_+ , \\qquad \\tilde r_q(v)=[2|r_q(v)|-1]_+\\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath89 when @xmath90 or @xmath91 the first error term in is modified to @xmath92 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th:2 ] is not discussed in the main body of this paper , since all of the needed information is contained in  4 and appendix b of @xcite .",
    "the main point is that theorem [ th:1 ] in fact establishes that for times @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 & e^{-itv^2/2}e^{it_2/2}e^{ixv}{\\textnormal{nls}_0}(t - t_2)[t(v){\\textnormal{sech}}(x)](x - x_0-tv ) \\\\ & + e^{-itv^2/2}e^{it_2/2}e^{-ixv}{\\textnormal{nls}_0}(t - t_2)[r(v){\\textnormal{sech}}(x)](x+x_0+tv ) \\\\ & + \\mathcal{o}(v^{-(1-{\\varepsilon } ) } ) + \\mathcal{o}(|q|^\\frac 13v^{-\\frac 76(1 - 2{\\varepsilon } ) } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 denotes the free nonlinear flow according to .",
    "this is the starting point of the arguments provided in  4 and appendix b of @xcite , which carry out an asymptotic ( in time ) description of the free nonlinear evolution of @xmath96 , for a constant @xmath97 .",
    "although the main point of the present paper is to handle the difficulties involved in the case @xmath16 stemming from the presence of a linear eigenstate , some of the refinements we introduce ( specifically , cubic correction terms in the interaction phase analysis ) improve the result of @xcite in the case @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , these refinements are simpler when carried out for @xmath15 directly , and we therefore write them out separately in that setting in  [ s : phase2pos ] .",
    "we summarize the results as :    [ th:3 ] in the case @xmath15 , the assumption in theorem [ th:1 ] can be replaced by the less restrictive @xmath98 , and the conclusion holds with the first error term dropped ( that is , @xmath99 is dropped and only @xmath100 is kept ) . also , the conclusion of theorem 2 holds with @xmath99 dropped from .",
    "thus in the @xmath101 case we improve the @xmath23 error from @xmath102 to @xmath103",
    ". it may be possible to to improve this error further to @xmath104 using an iterated integral expansion of the error in the spirit of sections [ s : phase2 ] and [ s : phase2pos ] , although a more detailed analysis than the one given there would be needed .",
    "we now outline the proof of theorem [ th:1 ] , the main result of the paper , highlighting the modifications of the argument in @xcite needed to address the case of @xmath16 .",
    "we will use the following terminology : the _ free linear _ evolution is according to the equation @xmath105 , the _ perturbed linear _ evolution is according to the equation @xmath106 , the _ free nonlinear _ evolution is according to the equation @xmath107 , and the _ perturbed nonlinear _",
    "evolution is according to the equation @xmath108 .",
    "the analysis breaks into three separate time intervals : phase 1 ( pre - interaction ) , phase 2 ( interaction ) , and phase 3 ( post - interaction ) .",
    "the analysis of phase 2 , discussed in part earlier , is initially based on the principle that at high velocities , the time length of interaction is short @xmath109 , and thus the perturbed nonlinear flow is well - approximated by the perturbed linear flow . in @xcite , this was proved to hold for @xmath15 with a bound on the @xmath23 discrepancy of size @xmath110 . in the case",
    "@xmath16 , we suffer some loss in the strength of the estimates due to the flow along the eigenstate @xmath111 , and by directly following the approach of @xcite the best error bound we could obtain is @xmath112 . in the important regime @xmath77",
    ", this gives an error bound of size @xmath113 , which does not suffice to carry through the phase 3 post - interaction analysis discussed below .",
    "for this reason , we are forced to introduce a cubic correction term to the linear approximation analysis in phase 2 .",
    "the strichartz based argument then shows that the @xmath23 size of the difference between the solution and the linear flow plus cubic correction is of size @xmath114 .",
    "however , since the cubic correction term is fairly explicit , we can do a direct analysis of it ( not using the strichartz estimates ) and show that it is also of size @xmath115 .",
    "thus , in the end , we learn that the solution itself is approximated by the perturbed linear flow with error @xmath116 .",
    "we then carry out the analysis of the perturbed linear evolution , as disscussed earlier , and show that by the end of the interaction phase , the solution is decomposed into a transmitted component ( modulo a phase factor ) @xmath117 and a reflected component ( again modulo a phase factor ) @xmath118 in the post - interaction analysis , we aim to argue that the solution is well - approximated by the free nonlinear flow of ( that we denote @xmath119 ) plus the free nonlinear flow of ( that we denote @xmath120 .",
    "it is at this stage that the most serious difficulties beyond those in @xcite are encountered .",
    "the approach employed in @xcite was to model the solution @xmath121 as @xmath122 , write the equation for @xmath123 induced by the equations for @xmath121 , @xmath119 , and @xmath124 , and bound @xmath125}l_x^2}$ ] over unit - sized time intervals @xmath126 $ ] in terms of the initial size @xmath127 for that time interval .",
    "this was accomplished by using the strichartz estimates .",
    "the strichartz estimates provide a bound on a whole family of space - time norms @xmath125}^ql_x^r}$ ] where @xmath128 are exponents satisfying an admissibilty condition @xmath129 .",
    "this family includes the norm @xmath130}^\\infty l_x^2 $ ] ; the other norms ( such as @xmath130}^6l_x^6 $ ] ) are needed since they necessarily arise on the right - hand size of the estimates . from these estimates , we are able to conclude that the error at most doubles over unit - sized time intervals , and thus after @xmath74 time intervals , we have incurred at most an error of size @xmath131 .",
    "this strategy presents a problem for the case @xmath16 , since the linear eigenstate @xmath132 is well - controlled in @xmath130}^\\infty l_x^2 $ ] ( of size @xmath133 ) but poorly controlled in @xmath130}^6l_x^6 $ ] ( of size @xmath134 ) .",
    "we thus opt to model the post - interaction solution as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the _ perturbed nonlinear _",
    "evolution of the @xmath137 projection of @xmath138 onto the linear bound state @xmath139",
    ". then we can use nonlinear estimates based on mass conservation and energy conservation to control the growth of @xmath136 over the interval @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath140 is orthogonal to the linear eigenstate , and we can use the strichartz estimates to control it over the interval @xmath126 $ ] . in the estimates , we take care to only evaluate @xmath136 in one of the norms controlled by mass or energy conservation . this argument is carried out in detail in  [ s : phase3 ] .    acknowledgments .",
