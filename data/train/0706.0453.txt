    "in this paper we return to the origins of the multifractal analysis of measures , which started with work on fractal sets by mandelbrot and others in the 1980s ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for this , we go even further back in time , and consider a function @xmath10 of the unit interval @xmath11 into itself , which was originally designed by minkowski @xcite in order to illustrate the lagrange property of quadratic surds .",
    "today , this function is usually referred to as the minkowski question mark function , and it appears in various different disguises .",
    "for instance , it appears as the distribution function of the measure of maximal entropy @xmath12 for the dynamical system arising from the farey map @xmath13 .",
    "that is , @xmath14 since the support of @xmath12 is equal to @xmath11 , and since @xmath12 is singular with respect to the @xmath15-dimensional lebesgue measure @xmath16 on @xmath11 ( see salem @xcite ) , the graph of @xmath10 is appropriately described by the term ` slippery devil s staircase ' , a term which was coined by gutzwiller and mandelbrot in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another disguise of @xmath10 is , that it provides a stable bridge between the farey system and the binary system @xmath17 , that is the dynamical system which arises from the tent map @xmath18 . in this disguise",
    ", the homeomorphism @xmath10 represents the topological conjugacy map between the farey system and the tent system , such that @xmath19 . using elementary observations for the regular continued fraction expansion @xmath20 $ ] of elements @xmath21 , one readily rediscovers the following alternating sum representation of @xmath10 , first obtained by denjoy @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath22\\in\\mathcal{u}.\\ ] ] these observations mark the starting point for the fractal geometric analysis of the function @xmath10 in this paper .",
    "we will show that interesting measure theoretical aspects of the minkowski scenario can be derived from the recently obtained multifractal analysis for stern - brocot intervals @xcite . as a first demonstration of the fruitfulness of this approach , we study fractal geometric relationships between @xmath10 , @xmath12 and the gauss measure @xmath23 .",
    "we obtain the result that one can explicitly compute the integral over @xmath10 with respect to @xmath23 , as well as the integral with respect to @xmath12 over the distribution function @xmath24 of @xmath23 .",
    "that is , with @xmath25 referring to the hausdorff dimension , we obtain @xmath26 as an immediate consequence of this , one can then also rediscover a result by kinney @xcite which expresses the hausdorff dimension of @xmath12 in terms of a certain explicit integral .",
    "+ subsequently , we draw the attention to the derivative @xmath27 of @xmath10 .",
    "it was shown only relatively recently in @xcite that if @xmath28 exists in the generalised sense , meaning that @xmath28 either exists or is equal to infinity , then @xmath28 either vanishes or else is equal to infinity .",
    "we give a new and very elementary proof of this fact , and then add to this by showing that @xmath28 is equal to infinity if and only if @xmath29 is equal to infinity .",
    "here , @xmath30 refers to the unique atom of the @xmath31-th refinement of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath13 , such that @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , we show that if for the approximants @xmath33 of @xmath34 $ ] we have @xmath35 , then @xmath28 vanishes ( see section 5 for the definition of @xmath36 ) .",
    "the latter , slightly technical observations will turn out to be crucial in the multifractal analysis of @xmath27 to come . in order to state the main results of this analysis , note that @xmath11 can be decomposed into mutually disjoint sets as follows .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath38 refers to the set of elements for which @xmath27 does not exist in the generalised sense .",
    "surprisingly , before these investigations relatively little was known about this decomposition .",
    "the main contributions thus far were made by salem , and these date back more than 60 years . in our notation ,",
    "the aforementioned result of salem @xcite reads as @xmath39 .",
    "more precisely , salem @xcite showed that if @xmath40)$ ] exists and is equal to some finite value , and if , additionally , @xmath41 , then @xmath42\\in\\lambda_{0}$ ] .",
    "the analysis in this paper will give significant extensions of this classical result . in order to state these extensions , recall that in @xcite we computed the dimension spectrum of the multifractal decomposition @xmath43 here , @xmath6 refers to the topological entropy of the farey map @xmath13 . in particular , in @xcite it was shown that the hausdorff dimension of @xmath44 is nontrivial if and only if @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 referring to the golden mean ) . by relating this multifractal decomposition to the minkowski scenario in this paper , a first outcome is that @xmath47,\\ , \\textrm{whereas } \\ , \\mathcal{l}(s)\\subset\\lambda_{0}\\ : \\ , \\textrm{for } \\ , s\\in[0,h_{\\mathrm{top}}).\\ ] ] by expressing this result in terms of the convergents @xmath33 of elements @xmath20 $ ] , one then immediately derives the following result .",
    "@xmath48 let us now finally come to the main result of this paper .",
    "for this , note that on the basis of the results of denjoy and salem , one might suspect that the complement of @xmath49 in @xmath11 can still be large , in the sense that its hausdorff dimension could be equal to one .",
    "our main result now shows that this is in fact not the case .",
    "more precisely , for the hausdorff dimensions of @xmath50 and @xmath38 , we obtain the result @xmath51    here , the proof of the second equality @xmath52 is derived from a non - trivial application of the multifractal formalism for stern - brocot intervals obtained in @xcite ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] ) , whereas the proof of the first equality @xmath53 combines this formalism with an extension of the analysis of sets of ` non - typical ' points in @xcite to non - hyperbolic dynamical systems .",
    "in contrast to ` ordinary devil s staircases ' , which usually arise from distribution functions of fractal measures on cantor - like sets , a _ slippery devil s staircase _ is the graph of the distribution function of a measure whose support is equal to the whole unit interval @xmath54 but which is nevertheless singular with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath16 on @xmath11 .",
    "slippery devil s staircases should not be confused with ordinary devil s staircases . in order to give a brief demonstration of the difference between these two types of staircases ,",
    "let us consider the example of the homogeneous cantor measure @xmath55 supported on cantor s ternary set @xmath56 .",
    "it is immediately clear that the derivative of the distribution function @xmath57 vanishes on the complement of @xmath56 in @xmath11 , giving that @xmath58 . by a result of darst @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , one has @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , by a classical result of gilman @xcite we have that if the derivative of @xmath57 exists in the generalised sense at some point @xmath60 , then it can only be equal to infinity .",
    "hence , @xmath61 . let us remark that the result of darst can be derived from straightforward adaptations of techniques developed for estimating the hausdorff dimension of well - approximable irrational numbers ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , in this situation , the set @xmath38 can be thought of as being conceptionally analogous to the set of well - approximable numbers .",
