    "the observed formation of intermetallic al - cr phases is in agreement with the phase diagram , e.g.  reported in @xcite . as the cathode surface is repeatedly heated by the localised plasma in the cathode spots and then cooled down after extinction of the individual spot , the cr grains dissolve in the surrounding al matrix .",
    "the reaction between cr and al and the formation of new phases during dissolving of the cr grains is governed by diffusion . since the necessary diffusion length varies with the size of the cr grains , small grains",
    "are fully reacted whereas larger grains only dissolve partially . as a result , not only the al - cr phases with similar chemical composition as the average composition of the virgin cathode form , but several intermetallic phases according to the degree of diffusion or intermixing . in the present work , al@xmath10cr , al@xmath11cr@xmath12 and alcr@xmath3 were identified in the xrd patterns recorded from the erosion zones of the different cathodes .",
    "the presence of other intermetallic al - cr phases can not be excluded due to similar structures and , hence , similar peak positions in the xrd patterns .",
    "however , it is apparent that the appearance of the cathode surface is different from its virgin state , i.e.  the original state of the cathode is of minor importance for the discharge since the plasma is formed from the modified layer on the cathode surface .",
    "similar observations were reported in literature for ti@xmath1al@xmath13 cathodes operated in vacuum conditions where mainly the formation of ti@xmath4al was noticed @xcite .",
    "other phases could not be identified unambiguously .",
    "the opposite effect was observed for ti@xmath4sic@xmath3 cathodes exposed to various discharge conditions @xcite . in this case , the ti@xmath4sic@xmath3 compound cathode decomposed due to the interaction with the plasma forming a modified layer consisting of tic@xmath13 grains embedded in a matrix of silicide phases .",
    "in general , it can be expected that the diffusion of the elements in the near - surface region of the cathodes is a function of the heat delivered to the cathode . here",
    ", the residence time of the individual cathode spots is decisive since slow moving spots remain longer at a single place and leave larger craters than fast moving spots . with more thermal energy delivered to the cathode surface",
    "an enhanced diffusion should take place and a thicker modified layer can form . applying this relation to the investigated al - cr cathodes in this work ,",
    "the cathode spots in ar atmosphere have the lowest velocity on the cr - rich al@xmath7cr@xmath6 cathode . but a linear relation with the cathode composition is absent as the observed modified layer on the al@xmath8cr@xmath8 is thinner than on the al - rich al@xmath6cr@xmath7 cathode indicating faster moving spots in the case of the former .    the discussed relation between the thickness of the modified layer and the velocity of the cathode spot motion assumes a constant erosion rate of the cathode regardless of the material encountered there . as it was shown , the appearance of the cathode surface is spatially inhomogeneous and changes with varying cathode composition .",
    "kimblin reported an erosion rate of al that is three times higher than the erosion rate of cr @xcite .",
    "this means that regions in the cathodes without cr grains will be eroded faster than regions with high concentrations of cr leading in an uneven erosion profile .",
    "however , since the distribution of the cr grains in the al matrix is random , the average erosion is independent of the material properties and mainly determined by the spatial distribution of the average plasma density . the latter is mainly influenced by the magnetic field configuration in the present case with a so - called `` steered arc '' @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the inert ar atmosphere or vacuum conditions ( not studied in current work ) , an arc plasma operated in reactive n@xmath3 or o@xmath3 atmosphere can alter the cathode surface also by reactions between the gas and the solid cathode which is frequently referred to as cathode poisoning @xcite . in the main erosion zones of all al - cr cathodes",
    "studied here basically no poisoning effects were observed , but only in the centre regions . due to the applied magnetic field configuration it is less likely that cathode spots are ignited in the centre of the cathode .",
    "this results in a reduced erosion from this region and nitrides and oxides were formed as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : alcr - cathode - erosion_overview ] , [ fig : sem_cross - sections_n2_alcr - centre ] and [ fig : sem_cross - sections_o2_alcr - centre ] .",
    "since the nitrides formed on the alcr cathodes are conductive , cathode spots are still ignited and erosion from the centre region of the cathodes still takes place to some extent . according to the phase analysis , mainly aln was present in the modified layer on the cathode surfaces .",
    "cr was reported to react only very littly with n@xmath3 in arc discharges @xcite which can explain the absence of crn@xmath13 phases .",
    "in contrast , the oxide layer observed is insulating and , hence , prevents the ignition of new cathode spots and the erosion of the cathodes . underneath the oxide layers shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sem_cross - sections_o2_alcr - centre ] there are modified layers noticeable similar to the ones observed on the cathodes exposed to ar atmosphere . prior to the o@xmath3 pressure reported in the present work",
    ", the cathodes were operated at lower o@xmath3 pressures as reported in @xcite .",
    "most likely , the oxide layer formed at lower o@xmath3 pressures was not stable enough to prevent the ignition of cathode spots completely and , therefore , a modified layer with intermixed al and cr was formed .    within the erosion zone ,",
    "the appearance of the oxide islands on the al@xmath8cr@xmath8 and al@xmath6cr@xmath7 cathodes is the only apparent cathode poisoning effect .",
    "such oxide islands have already been reported in literature for al@xmath14cr@xmath15 cathodes , but also for other al - containing cathodes , e.g.  al@xmath16v@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms causing the formation of such oxide islands are not well understood .",
    "however , the ignition of cathode spots on top of the oxide islands is prevented due to the insulating character of the formed oxide . in the vicinity of these islands , the erosion of the cathode proceeds resulting in the apparent `` growth '' of the islands . with time",
    "the neck connecting the island to the bulk of the cathode will be thinned ( an early stage is observable in fig .",
    "[ fig : sem_o2_oxide - island]b ) and the oxide island will ultimately be detached due to the progressing erosion . a possibility to suppress",
    "the formation of oxide islands is due to the addition of small contents of si to the cathode as reported in @xcite .",
    "even though the alcr cathode contained 5 at.% of si , it was not incorporated into the deposited coating which was explained by the formation of volatile si oxides in the discharge .",
    "the formation of intermetallic phases in the erosion zone of the al - cr cathodes operated in n@xmath3 and o@xmath3 atmospheres is comparable to reports in literature investigating al - cr-(si ) @xcite , ti - si @xcite or ti - al @xcite cathodes .",
    "the ti containing cathodes were exposed to arc discharges in n@xmath3 atmosphere and the formation of nitrides in the modified layer in addition to intermetallic phases was noticed .",
    "this can be understood by the different magnetic field configurations used for the experiments . in the present case",
    ", there were no reactive layers in the erosion zone , but in the cathode centre .",
    "apparently , the overall material removal from the al - cr cathodes in the erosion zones at the applied n@xmath3 and o@xmath3 pressures dominates over the formation of reactive layers and mainly metallic surfaces were observed on the al - cr cathodes analysed here .",
    "however , the presence of the reactive gases n@xmath3 and o@xmath3 influences the erosion characteristics as the thickness of the modified layers with intermixed al and cr is altered in comparison to the modified layers in ar atmosphere .",
    "the slightly lower thickness of the modified layers in n@xmath3 than in ar atmosphere can be explained by the broader erosion zone and the on average shorter residence time of the cathode spots at a single location .",
    "in addition , a change from type 1 to type 2 spots should occur with the presence of n@xmath3 and ( partial ) cathode poisoning @xcite .",
    "this results in a locally reduced heating of the cathode surface and , hence , less intermixing of al and cr .    in the case of the very thin or absent modified layers on the cathodes exposed to o@xmath3 atmosphere ,",
    "similar effects are active .",
    "a superficial oxidation of a few atomic layers up to a few nm in the afterglow of a cathode spot crater reduces the conductivity in this region .",
    "electrons getting trapped subsequently cause a localised enhancement of the electric field which in turn favours the ignition of a new cathode spot plasma at this place and the evaporation of the formed thin oxide layer .",
    "as described in @xcite , the higher electron emission due to the lower work function of alo@xmath13 than al @xcite is also beneficial . in this way",
    ", the cathode spot motion is strongly accelerated within the erosion zone and oxides formed on the heated cathode surface will be removed by the arc discharge . only at places where a stable oxide of sufficient thickness can form the ignition of cathode spots",
    "is prevented due to the insulating nature of the al - cr oxides .",
    "this means that the erosion of cathode material is stopped in this region and the oxide can remain on the cathode surface as it was the case in the cathode centres and the oxide islands .",
    "the detailed analysis of composite al@xmath0cr@xmath1 cathodes exposed to arc plasmas revealed the formation of a modified layer on the cathode surfaces , where al and cr are intermixed due to the heat transfer from the plasma to the cathode in the cathode spots .",
    "the formation of intermetallic al - cr phases was noticed for all cathodes and atmospheres tested .",
    "the thickest modified layer was observed on the cathodes operated in ar atmosphere . due to faster moving cathode spots and , hence , reduced heat transfer in n@xmath3 and o@xmath3 atmospheres , the thickness of the modified layer was lower in these cases .    as a result of the applied arched magnetic field configuration , non - uniform cathode poisoning effects were observed in the reactive atmospheres . within the circular main erosion zone no reactive layer formed except oxide islands on the al - rich cathodes in o@xmath3 atmosphere . in the centre region of the cathodes nitrides and oxides were present on the cathodes exposed to arc plasma in n@xmath3 and o@xmath3 atmosphere , respectively .",
    "the continuous , amorphous oxide layer prevented the ignition of new cathode spots due to its insulating character and , hence , the erosion of the cathode in this region .    in general , as the appearance of the cathode surface is modified with respect to its virgin state due to the interaction with the plasma , the modified cathode surface layer determines the arc plasma properties . a detailed knowledge about the phases present on eroded cathodes is therefore of vital importance in order to understand the arc plasma properties .",
