    "the study of neutral pion production in proton - proton collision near threshold , @xmath0 , has been inspired by precise measurements of the near - threshold cross section  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the measured cross section turned out to be @xmath1 5 times larger than the early theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , some mechanisms to account for the threshold experimental data have been suggested in model calculations  @xcite .",
    "heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath2pt ) is a low - energy effective field theory ( eft ) of qcd and provides us a systematic perturbation scheme in terms of @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes small external momentum and/or symmetry breaking term @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the chiral scale @xmath7 gev : @xmath8 is the pion decay constant .",
    "though many works on the @xmath0 reaction near threshold in hb@xmath2pt have been done  @xcite ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , some issues in theoretically describing the process have not been fully clarified . in the next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "hb@xmath2pt calculations  @xcite , a significant enhancement of the off - shell @xmath9 vertex function obtained from the nlo hb@xmath2pt lagrangian is found .",
    "however , the two - body ( one - pion - exchange ) matrix element with the off - shell @xmath9 vertex is almost exactly canceled with the one - body matrix element . thus the experimental data can not be reproduced in the nlo calculations . in the next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) hb@xmath2pt calculations  @xcite",
    ", a significant contribution comes out of the nnlo corrections and a moderate agreement with the experimental data is obtained  @xcite .",
    "however , the chiral series based on the standard weinberg s counting rules  @xcite shows poor convergence .    a modification of the original weinberg s counting rules to account for the large momentum transfer , @xmath10 where @xmath5 and @xmath11 are the pion and nucleon masses , respectively , is discussed in ref .",
    "the production operators at nlo using the modified counting rules are estimated , and it was reported that the nlo contributions exactly cancel among themselves  @xcite . recently , some detailed issues for the loop calculations , such as a concept of reducibility  @xcite , a representation invariance of the chiral fields among the loop diagrams , and a proper choice of the heavy - nucleon propagator  @xcite , were also studied .",
    "meanwhile , it is known that the energy dependence of the experimental data can be well reproduced in terms of the final state interaction and the phase space  @xcite . a `` minimal '' formalism to take account of these two features would be a _",
    "theory , in which virtual pions exchanged between the two nucleons are integrated out ; in this pionless theory , the one - pion exchange , two - pion exchange and contact terms in hb@xmath2pt are subsumed in a contact term .",
    "furthermore , after taking these two features into account , the difference between the theory and experiment appears in the overall factor and the experimental data can be easily reproduced by fitting an unknown constant that appears in a contact vertex . in this work",
    "@xcite we employ a pionless eft with a di - baryon  @xcite cross section at bbn energies@xcite and neutron - neutron fusion process@xcite employing this formalism . ] and external pions  @xcite to calculate the total cross section of the @xmath0 process .",

    "by contrast , we obtain almost vanishing total cross sections with the value @xmath87 @xmath83 because the two - body amplitude with @xmath87 @xmath83 is almost canceled with the amplitude from the one - body contribution .",
    "on the other hand , for the whole energy range the experimental near - threshold cross section data are well reproduced with the use of the fitted parameter @xmath88 @xmath83 .",
    "we also find that approximately a half of the observed cross section comes from the one - body ( ia ) amplitude in the pionless theory .    in this work we calculated the total cross section for @xmath0 near threshold in pionless eft with the di - baryon and external pion fields .",
    "the leading one - body amplitude and subleading contact amplitude were obtained including the strong initial state interaction and the strong and coulomb final - state interactions .",
    "after we fix the lecs for the @xmath37 scatterings , there remains only one unknown constant , @xmath56 , in the amplitude .",
    "we estimated it from the one - pion exchange diagram in the pionful theory .",
    "although this method does not allow us to fix the sign of @xmath56 , we have found that one of the two choices for @xmath56 leads to the cross sections that agree with the experimental data reasonably well . on the other hand",
    ", the whole range of the experimental data near threshold can be reproduced by adjusting the only unknown lec in the theory , @xmath56 . as discussed in introduction ,",
    "this is an expected result because the energy dependence of the experimental total cross section is known to be well described by the phase factor and the final - state interaction  @xcite , which have been taken into account in this work , and the overall strength of the cross section can be adjusted by the value of @xmath56",
    ". this feature would be the same in the nnlo hb@xmath2pt calculations because an unknown constant appears in the contact @xmath89 vertex and can be adjusted so as to reproduce the experimental data though there are many other corrections coming out of the pion loop diagrams .",
