    "predicting the genetic makeup of a large population sample based on a small subsample serves two distinct purposes .",
    "first , it can facilitate study design by providing the expected number of samples needed to achieve a given discovery goal , be it enough markers for a custom array design or enough rare variants to perform a well - powered burden test .",
    "second , such predictions serve as a useful test for our statistical and evolutionary hypotheses about the population . because evolutionary experiments for long - lived organisms are extremely difficult , predictions about evolution are hard to falsify . by contrast , predictions about the outcome of sequencing experiments can be easily tested , thanks to the rapid advances in sequencing technology . this opportunity to test our models",
    "should be taken advantage of . here",
    ", we show that such predictions can be easily generated to high accuracy and in a way that is robust to many model assumptions such as mating patterns , selection , or population structure .",
    "we are interested in predicting the number of sites that are variable for some  omic \" feature across samples .",
    "features may be of different types ( snps , indels , binding sites , epigenetic markers , etc . ) , and samples may be cells , cell types , whole organisms , or even entire populations or species . for definiteness , we will focus primarily on predicting the discovery rate of genetic variants ( snps or indels ) in a population . because variant discovery is central to many large - scale sequencing efforts",
    ", many methods have been proposed to predict the number of variants discovered as a function of sample size in a given population .",
    "some methods require explicit modeling of complex evolutionary scenarios , fitting parameters to existing data @xcite .",
    "these approaches enable model testing , but they are complex and computationally intensive .",
    "the interpretation of model parameters can also be challenging @xcite .",
    "ionita - laza _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out a similarity between the variant discovery problem and a well - studied species counting problems in ecology @xcite , and this led to the development of tractable heuristic approaches that rely on simple assumptions about underlying distributions of allele frequencies @xcite .",
    "these methods are easy to use and often accurate , but the validity of the heuristic assumptions is uncertain , and departures from these models can lead to uncontrolled errors ( see @xcite and the debate in @xcite ) .    in this article , we build on the results of @xcite to propose improved estimators and quantify their uncertainties and biases .",
    "even though fully nonparametric estimators were deemed impossible in the ecology problem ( see @xcite , and discussion ) , we obtain a nonparametric estimator based on linear programming ( lp ) that is asymptotically optimal in the infinite - genome limit , in the sense that the estimated confidence intervals contain precisely the values that are consistent with the data .",
    "these lp estimators are similar to estimators developed in the slightly different context of vocabulary size estimation ( see @xcite , and discussion ) .",
    "whereas parametric approaches were needed to get meaningful predictions beyond 10-fold extrapolation in the vocabulary problem , the nonparametric lp approach provide estimates of the number of genetic variants within @xmath1 of the correct value under 20-fold sample increases in a realistic genetic model in the infinite - genome limit , and within @xmath6 when @xmath7 polymorphisms are present in the entire sample .",
    "we also present a jackknife - based estimator and provide strategies to estimate both the sampling uncertainty ( via bootstrap ) and bounds to the bias of the estimator . by applying the estimators to data generated by the 1000 genomes project ( 1000 g ) and the nhlbi exome sequencing project ( esp ) , we find that both estimators compare favorably with the state of the art for computational efficiency , accuracy , and robustness to biases .",
    "we provide examples of how these estimators can be used after preliminary data have been obtained to decide on the sample size required to achieve a given discovery goal , to estimate the impact of sample composition on projected study outcomes , and to predict the proportion of synonymous to non - synonymous sites as a function of sample size .",
    "experimental design decisions require weighing many different factors , some of which must be estimated from incomplete information .",
    "simple and robust estimates of the composition of the final sample should provide a useful tool for scientists seeking to obtain a clearer picture of the expected outcomes of different experimental strategies .    finally ,",
    "because nonparametric approaches do not depend on a specific evolutionary or biochemical model , they can be applied to a variety of genomic features . as an illustration",
    ", we apply the lp approach to predict the number of dnasei footprints to be identified as a function of the number of cell types studied .",
    "thus , the number of occupied transcription factor binding sites across all cell types in an organism can be estimated directly ( and accurately ) from a randomly selected sample of cell types .",
    "in addition to being a tool for study design , the discovery rate can answer fundamental biological questions , such as the total proportion of dna that is bound by any or all transcription factors in any cell type .",
    "software is available through the author s webpage .",
    "capture  recapture experiments use statistical inference to estimate population sizes without observing every individual .",
    "they use the overlap among random subsamples to estimate redundancy , and therefore of how much new information is to be found in unobserved samples .",
    "for example , the size of a rabbit population may be estimated by tagging @xmath8 randomly selected rabbits and counting the proportion @xmath9 of tagged rabbits in a subsequent random sample from the population .",
    "if rabbits and samplings are uniform and independent , the total population can be estimated as @xmath10 . in practice",
    ", a number of complications may arise : sampling conditions may vary across field trips , rabbits can join or leave the population , and they can become afraid or fond of the capture device . as a result ,",
    "an extensive literature on statistical methods accounts for these complications @xcite .",
    "a particularly challenging situation occurs when rabbits vary in their probability of capture . in this case",
    ", no amount of data can rule out the existence of a large number of very uncatchable rabbits .",
    "based on this intuition , it has been argued that unbiased estimator for this problem required prior knowledge of the distribution of capture probability @xcite .",
    "ionita - laza _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that predicting the number of genetic variants that are present in a population is closely related to this rabbit - counting problem . in the analogy between the genetic and ecological cases , displayed in table [ analogy ] , rabbits to be counted",
    "are replaced by genetic variants ; the capture of a rabbit is replaced by the variant identification in a sequenced ( haploid ) genome ; and the probability of capturing a given rabbit on a given field trip is replaced by the population frequency of the variant .",
    ".some analogies between rabbit and genetic variant counting [ analogy ] [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     lp approaches provide significantly tighter bounds than second - order naive linear bounds and , surprisingly , allow for accurate extrapolations over more than an order of magnitude in sample size .",
    "however , these simulations assume a nearly infinite genome , and the convergence to this limit may be slow .",
    "figure [ lvnn ] shows the slow increase in prediction accuracy with sample size . in a sample with ten million polymorphisms ,",
    "the 20-fold extrapolations are not very precise , but 8-fold extrapolations provide conservative lower bounds @xmath11 below the correct value and upper bounds @xmath12 above .",
    "the 1000 genomes project has released exome - capture data for 1092 individuals from 14 populations : some from predominantly european ( ceu , tsi , gbr , fin , ibs ) , african ( yri , lwk ) , east asian ( chb , jpt , chs ) ancestry , and others of mixed continental ancestry ( asw , mxl , clm , pur ) . figure [ subsample ] shows the number of nonreference variants discovered as a function of sample size in each population .    to estimate the accuracy of the capture  recapture strategies",
    ", we randomly drew subsamples of 10 , 20 , and 50 diploid individuals , and extrapolated the number of discoveries from each subsample size to the next larger subsample size , or to the full population size .",
    "we find that the lp approach and the harmonic jackknife provide accurate estimates to within a few percent of the true values ( figures [ subsample ] and [ subsampleboot ] ) , whereas the bo and beta distribution estimators underestimate the number of variants for most populations ( figure [ subsampleboot ] ) .",
    "the demographic model approach is only slightly more biased than lp and hamonic jackknife , but it is also more intensive computationally and technically .",
    "even though the harmonic jackknife and lp approaches appear unbiased for all populations , the variance of the estimate depends on the population , with recently admixed populations ( asw , clm , mxl , and pur ) showing the most variance , followed by populations with known cryptic relatedness ( lwk and chs ) .",
    "this variance indicates that the relatively small subsamples have  personality \" in these populations ",
    "if a sample contains an individual with particularly high european ancestry proportion , or a pair of closely related individual , it may sway the estimate in a way that would not occur in a more uniform sample . if we consider confidence intervals based on poisson random field ( prf ) parametric bootstrap , which assumes a perfectly homogeneous sample , @xmath13 confidence intervals contain the observed data in @xmath14 of cases , whereas the harmonic jackknife confidence intervals contain the true value @xmath15 of the time ( see also figure [ citest ] ) . if we exclude populations with admixture and relatedness , the proportion of confidence intervals containing the correct value increases to @xmath16 for lp and @xmath17 for the jackknife .",
    "inhomogeneity effects are expected to decrease with sample size .",
    "importantly , both the harmonic jackknife and lp estimators appear to remain unbiased and accurate even for small inhomogeneous samples .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the bo jackknife and the parametric beta distribution approach of @xcite [ subsampleboot ] , which exhibit substantial bias for most populations .",
    "extrapolations from the 1000 g data are shown in figure [ 1000pred ] .",
    "the harmonic jackknife and lp estimates are in good agreement . as in @xcite , we find that the african - american population ( asw ) , with predominantly west african and european continental ancestries , has the highest predicted discovery rate .",
    "this is a joint effect of the high diversity of the african source population and of the contribution of two continental populations .",
    "by contrast , the finns ( fin ) show the least amount of diversity , consistent with a smaller recent effective population size .",
    "whereas the populations tend to cluster by continental ancestry at low sample sizes , reflecting shared histories , continental ancestry becomes less informative as sample sizes are increased , revealing consequences of the more recent histories of the sampled populations .      to test whether the approach is applicable to cross - cohort prediction , we applied the method to data from the first 2500 sequenced individuals of the exome sequencing project @xcite , which combined data across different cohorts and sequencing centres .",
    "figure [ cohorts ] shows the total number of variants based on variants observed by four different sequencing groups ( focusing on 1-ldl , 2-eomi , 3-bmi & eos , and 4-lung diseases , see @xcite for cohort and project descriptions ) .",
    "we find excellent agreement for predictions based on these subsets .",
    "the largest departure is from the european - american sample for group 3 , which is also the smallest subset .    finally , to obtain the prediction for the largest possible sample , we considered the most recent data released by the esp project , including over 6500 individuals of european - american and african - american descent , and generated predictions based on samples of 2000 african - americans and 4000 europeans , for sites with mean coverage above 40 .",
    "even though african - american populations have the most variable sites in present - day samples , we predict that this will no longer be the case in samples of @xmath4 diploid individuals , with @xmath18 of target sites predicted to be variable in european - americans , compared to @xmath3 in african - americans .",
    "the crossover is predicted to occur between 7,500 and 10,000 individuals .",
    "the predicted number of variants is higher in european - americans for both synonymous and nonsynonymous variants ( figure [ esp](a ) ) , but the proportion of nonsynonymous variants is likely to remain higher in europeans than in african - americans ( figure [ esp](b ) ) , likely reflecting an excess of deleterious variants in europeans .",
    "the nonsynonymous : synonymous ratio will remain considerably lower than the neutral expectation under a hwang  green mutational model @xcite until samples in the millions are considered .",
    "because the lp approach is nonparametric , it can be applied to any genomic feature that is present genome - wide and across samples . to illustrate this",
    ", we consider dnasei footprints , which indicate sites where transcription factors bind to dna and protect against cleavage by dnasei .",
    "encode produced a genome - wide map of such features across 41 different cell types @xcite .",
    "using the same software , we are able to predict the number of transcription factor binding sites that will be identified as the number of cell types is increased .",
    "we identified sites as contiguous genomic regions where at least one cell type has a footprint .",
    "the lp bounds are particularly tight in this example ( figure [ dnase ] ) , and the main source of uncertainty in this problem is the degree to which the choice of cell types in the encode study is representative of the remaining cell types with respect to transcription factor binding .",
    "jackknife and lp approaches for finite and infinite extrapolation for the species - counting problem have been discussed before @xcite .",
    "the sampling processes , binomial for t rabbit - counting problem , poisson for the species - counting problem and hypergeometric in the genetics context , lead to fundamental differences . for example , in the poisson case , an infinite number of data points is available because each species can be observed an arbitrary number of times .",
    "this allows for a ( possibly divergent ) formal expansion of the number of unobserved variants in terms of the @xmath19@xcite . in the binomial and hypergeometric cases",
    ", we have only a finite number of observations @xmath20 , making it clear that the series expansion can not provide an exact result . in addition , the size @xmath21 of the population from which our sample was drawn determines how accurately we can perform extrapolations to sizes @xmath22 , a situation that does not have a direct analog in the poisson case .",
    "a difference between the genetics problem and both the species- and rabbit - counting problems is the target extrapolation size : in many ecological problems , the number of field trips itself is not a variable of interest , and the ultimate goal is to extrapolate to infinite sample sizes .",
    "in such a case , the resulting confidence interval would be semi - infinite .",
    "intuitively , we can never exclude the possibility that a very large number of very uncatchable rabbits have eluded detection . as a result ,",
    "all point estimates require implicit or explicit assumptions about the existence of such sneaky rabbits .",
    "this led to the correct statement @xcite that nonparametric point estimates are impossible in the rabbit - counting problem .",
    "nonparametric point estimates are still impossible in the finite extrapolation context studied here : there is a finite interval of values equally consistent with the data , and any choice implies parametric assumptions .",
    "however , if this finite interval is narrow enough , we may not need point estimates : in many cases , the predicted consistency interval is narrower than other uncertainty sources .",
    "thus nonparametric point estimates do not exist , but this may not be important : lp provides a practical , nonparametric interval estimator .",
    "some of the strategies that we have proposed may translate back to the ecology problems .",
    "one example is the coarsening strategy used in the finite genome problem , in which we merge bins of less - informative common variants to improve computational performance and accuracy .",
    "we have found that extrapolations can be accurate beyond 20-fold increases in sample size , a finding surprising in the light of previous work .",
    "the accuracy of projections as a function of sampling scheme , sample size , and model assumptions remains a largely open question of considerable theoretical interest .",
    "we have discussed five different extrapolation strategies in this article , and found that two of these ( the harmonic jackknife and lp ) outperformed the others ( beta distribution , demographic modeling , and bo jackknife ) .",
    "the beta distribution and demographic modeling suffer from their attempt to model the entire allele frequency distribution via a few - parameter family of models . with larger datasets , departures from these model families",
    "become more significant and lead to the observed biases . by contrast , the jackknife approaches fit a similar number of parameters but model only the rare end of the frequency spectrum , which contains most of the information about future discovery rates . in that sense , they make better use of fitting parameters , but the assumptions of the bo jackknife differ too much from realistic genetic scenarios .",
    "the assumptions of the harmonic jackknife , by contrast , include realistic genetic scenarios , and as a result the extrapolations are quite accurate .",
    "finally , linear programming does not require any assumptions about allele frequency distribution , and as a result is much more broadly applicable than the other methods .",
    "furthermore , in the infinite - genome limit , it uses all the information available in the data , and we have found it to be surprisingly accurate .",
    "thus , the nonparametric and less parametric methods fare very well in this comparison .",
    "this is because the large dataset is very informative about the underlying distribution , making parametric assumptions both less useful and more risky .      among the many approaches that we have discussed for predicting the number of unobserved variants , linear programming and the harmonic jackknife",
    "stand out as being less biased .",
    "so which one should be used in practice ?",
    "the harmonic jackknife approach is the fastest to compute , and provides comparable results to lp for a diversity of realistic evolutionary scenarios .",
    "when applicable , the parametric assumption may help obtain slightly more precise results compared to the linear programming approach .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that it will perform poorly for strong departures from the standard neutral model , or in systems with entirely different dynamics , such as transcription factor binding sites across cell types .",
    "by contrast , the lp approach does not assume a specific form for the distribution of allele frequency , and it can easily be modified to entirely different problems , or account for additional ( linear ) constraints with little to no validation effort required . for example , we could easily have imposed a constraint that the underlying frequency spectrum be strictly decreasing over some range of frequencies , leading to a narrower confidence interval .",
    "implementing such a change in the jackknife approach would have been challenging . in many cases , lp is the only trustworthy solution . in a few cases of very large samples ,",
    "lp problems may require additional optimization and it may be easier to use the jackknife . in cases",
    "where both are applicable , we suggest using both methods ; if the jackknife falls outside the lp bounds , we know that its assumptions were not met , and the lp estimator should be used . otherwise , the jackknife estimator is probably the most principled guess among the values allowed by lp .    where computationally tractable ,",
    "the linear programming approach has important advantages , the main one being the easy transferability to different types of problems .",
    "however , from a practical standpoint , jackknife estimators are not to be discounted .",
    "they are extremely fast and , even though the underlying assumptions may be difficult to interpret in terms of the fundamental processes involved , they tend to produce accurate estimators in a wide range of scenarios .",
    "comparison of the exact and jackknife weights ( figure [ jkapprox ] and the appendix ) provides good intuition for this relative robustness .",
    "finally , even though the lp bounds are asymptotically optimal among nonparametric estimators , a visual inspection of the underlying distributions ( figure [ minmax ] ) suggests that even fairly conservative biological assumptions can produce narrower bounds .",
    "for example , requiring that the large population be drawn from an even larger population resulted in improved intervals ( table [ tabex ] ) .",
    "some other assumptions , such as smoothness or monotonicity over a range of frequencies , can easily be accommodated in a linear program and would be worth exploring .",
    "the most crucial assumption underlying the extrapolation methods presented here is random sampling ",
    "we must be able to consider the existing sample as a random subset of the larger population .",
    "by contrast , we found that recent admixture , population structure , linkage , and cryptic relatedness do not seem to cause substantial biases , and the lp approach should be applicable to datasets whose evolution is fundamentally different from that of snps .",
    "we found that some of these factors change the variance of these estimates : populations with more sample inhomogeneity and cryptic relatedness lead to more variable estimates , but we expect these effects to decrease when the sample size is increased",
    ". we do not expect linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) to bias our estimates , because ld does not affect the expected frequency spectrum that is the starting point of our estimates .",
    "furthermore , we are mostly concerned with rare variants , which typically are not in high ld with each other",
    ". thus , both the expectation and variance of genome - wide estimates should be little affected by ld",
    ". there may be applications where variances are more affected by correlations : in the transcription factor binding example",
    ", we may imagine that cell - type - specific transcription factor binding sites cluster , in which case the poisson random field that we used to estimate confidence intervals may become a poor approximation . in such cases , leave - one - out experiments should be performed to assess confidence intervals .    the random subsampling assumption remains a demanding one  in practice , subtle differences in sampling make it likely that results extrapolated from one sample will not apply to another one .",
    "witness the 1000 genomes data ( figure [ 1000pred ] ) , which sampled largely distinct populations . in this case , very different discovery rate estimates reflect the different recent histories of the populations .",
    "on the other hand , we also find that results in the large medical cohorts from esp are exquisitely reproducible across cohorts , even though these are definitely not subsamples of each other .",
    "by contrast with the 1000 genomes data , the esp meta - cohort was assembled using comparable ( even sometimes overlapping ) cohorts @xcite .",
    "this emphasizes how the methods presented here are applicable to make predictions across panels that are similar but not identical .",
    "large sequencing efforts such as the 1000 genomes project often start with a pilot project aimed at testing the technology , identifying possible issues , and providing funding bodies and stakeholders a preview of the full project .",
    "the methods presented here provide a straightforward and well - calibrated approach to estimating a key deliverable in the final project .",
    "as the project is completed , the results can be compared to the initial predictions , assessing the impact of methodological and sampling changes between the pilot and the main phase .",
    "of course , the final results can be extrapolated to serve as a baseline prediction for the next set of experiments .    predicting the number of variants to be discovered in a new sample is one of the few areas where population geneticists studying long - lived organisms can make experimental predictions , and as such is an important tool for population genetics hypothesis validation .",
    "the success of the nonparametric methods presented here shows that this can be performed to high accuracy .",
    "however , the success of nonparametric methods and their robustness to linkage , demography , population structure , and selection suggests that accurate model - based predictions of future discovery rates do not necessarily provide additional evidence that these effects are correctly taken into account .",
    "over - fitted models that are consistent with the data should provide predictions within the lp confidence intervals .",
    "model - based predictions should therefore improve upon the lp predictions to validate the model .",
    "by contrast , the lp prediction provides a strong test of whether the initial sample can be considered a random subsample of the full population , a commonly used assumption in population genetics models .",
    "this work therefore demonstrates that nontrivial falsifiable predictions can easily be generated and tested against future genomics experiments .",
    "i hope that it will encourage more genomicists to put their head on the prediction block .",

    "this interpretation of the jackknife provides intuition about the behavior of jackknife estimators when the underlying model is not within @xmath37 ; comparison of the jackknife weight @xmath38 and the correct weight @xmath39 ( figure [ jkapprox ] ) provides an idea of the general accuracy of the jackknife estimate , and an idea of the frequencies that are more ( or less ) sensitive to errors .",

    "the observed @xmath60 is easily incorporated as an additional equality constraint stipulating that @xmath63 .",
    "intuitively , we expect that the additional constraint will help narrow the confidence interval",
    ". however , when the total sample size is equal to the extrapolation size ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) , this provides limited information because the additional constraint involves a new variable , @xmath65 , that is not involved in the objective function @xmath66 .",
