    "in order to use perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) for the description of exclusive processes , one usually appeals to factorization theorems , which ensure that the pqcd calculable information , described by the so - called hard scattering amplitude , @xmath1 , can be factored out at a factorization scale @xmath2 , whereas all pqcd non - calculable ( i.e. , non - perturbative ) contributions are encoded in terms of universal hadron distribution amplitudes ( da)s , @xmath3 .",
    "schematically , this can be illustrated for the case of the @xmath4 transition form factor in the following way : @xmath5 where @xmath0 and @xmath6 are the photon virtualities and @xmath7 denotes the usual convolution symbol ( @xmath8 ) over the longitudinal momentum fraction variable @xmath9 .",

    "the one - loop evolution kernel @xmath13 was introduced in ref.@xcite ; an analogous expression for @xmath14 at the two - loop level was derived in refs .",
    "if factorization applies , it is , in principle , safe and legitimate to use different values of @xmath2 , dispensing with the factorization - scale dependence by means of the renormalization group .",

    "the structure of the two - loop evolution kernel was analyzed by mikhailov and radyushkin ( mr ) in  @xcite and its diagonality violating terms ( in the gegenbauer basis ) were identified , though their origin remained partly unclear .",
    "moreover , the two - loop evolution with @xmath0 of any pion da at the reference ( or initial ) momentum @xmath21 was carried out numerically , but including only the first few expansion coefficients at order @xmath22 . on that basis",
    ", these authors concluded that the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) correction to the pion da with @xmath23  gev@xmath19 and at @xmath24 remains less than a few percent even for momenta far beyond @xmath25  gev@xmath19 .",
    "later , the two - loop evolution of the pion da was studied by mller in @xcite using conformal constraints . in this work , a complete formal solution in nlo was obtained with the inclusion of all two - loop mixing coefficients .",
    "this solution was further discussed in  @xcite for a running and also a fixed coupling constant .",
