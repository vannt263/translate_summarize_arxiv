    "the astrophysical site of the rapid - neutron - capture nucleosynthesis ( _ r_-process ) , which accounts for about half of nuclei heavier than iron , has been a long - standing mystery . during the last decade ,",
    "the neutrino - heated ejecta from a nascent neutron star ( neutrino - driven winds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been considered to be the most promising astrophysical site for the _ r_-process .",
    "previous studies show , however , severe problems in obtaining requisite high entropy and short dynamic timescale for the production of heavy _ r_-process nuclei @xcite . the general relativistic effect for a very compact proto - neutron star ( e.g. , the mass of @xmath3 with the radius of 10  km , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or a magnetar - like magnetic field strength @xcite have been invoked to increase entropy and reduce the dynamic timescale of the winds .",
    "it is questionable , however , if such physical conditions can be the general requirements for the _ r_-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "@xcite have suggested that an additional energy input to the neutrino - driven wind at between 1.5 and 3 times the neutron star radius is efficient to increase entropy and reduce dynamic timescale of the wind material . in this _ letter _ , it is shown that strong anisotropy in neutrino emission from the proto - neutron star , _ if it exists _",
    ", acts as this extra energy source and helps the _ r_-process . the neutrino - driven wind model with spherically symmetric",
    ", steady outflow approximation is used to obtain the wind trajectories (   2 )",
    ". a sudden increase of neutrino number density in winds owing to anisotropic neutrino emission is modeled by enhancing the neutrino luminosity .",
    "nucleosynthesis calculations with the obtained thermodynamic trajectories are performed to demonstrate this effect (   3 ) .",
    "finally , a possible origin of this anisotropy in neutrino emission and some implications of this study are discussed (   4 ) .",
    "the wind trajectories in this study are obtained using the semi - analytic , general relativistic model of neutrino - driven winds explored in @xcite and @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the system is treated as time stationary and spherically symmetric , and the radius of the neutron star is assumed to be the same as that of the neutrino sphere .",
    "the heating source that drives matter from the neutrino sphere is due to neutrino interactions .",
    "heating is due to @xmath4 and @xmath5 capture on free nucleons ( @xmath6 ) , neutrino scattering by electrons and positrons ( @xmath7 ) , and neutrino - antineutrino pair annihilation into electron - positron pairs ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "cooling is due to electron and positron capture on free nucleons ( @xmath9 ) and electron - positron pair annihilation into neutrino - antineutrino pairs ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the rms average neutrino energies are taken to be 10 , 20 , and 30  mev , for electron , anti - electron , and the other flavors of neutrinos , respectively . the mass ejection rate at the neutrino sphere @xmath11",
    "is determined so that the wind becomes supersonic through the sonic point .",
    "the mass and radius of the neutron star are taken to be @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the neutrino luminosity of one specific flavor is assumed to be the same for all other flavors , which is taken to be a constant value @xmath14 .",
    "note that the assumption of a constant @xmath15 is reasonable , since the crossing time of a wind over the heating region ( @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "2 ) is short enough , @xmath17 , compared to the decay timescale of @xmath15 ( a few seconds , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as explored in previous studies , this _ typical _ choice of parameter set ( with isotropic neutrino emission ) results in insufficient physical conditions ( i.e. , low entropy and long dynamic timescale ) for the production of heavy _",
    "r_-process nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this study , anisotropy in neutrino emission",
    "is modeled schematically as follows .",
    "given there is substantially higher neutrino emission from the `` hot spot '' , which is marked by the point p@xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) in figure  1 . at the point p@xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) nearby p@xmath18 , the ejection of matter is due to the local ( lower ) isotropic neutrino emission around p@xmath20 .",
    "the matter suddenly sees a substantially larger number of neutrinos when passing through the point p@xmath22 .",
    "note that neutrino emission at an arbitrary point on the neutrino sphere ( e.g. , p@xmath20 or p@xmath18 ) is assumed to be isotropic in all directions ( i.e. , the local neutrino flux is _ not _ radial ) as in @xcite .",
    "this sudden increase of the neutrino number density at p@xmath22 is approximated by a jump of the neutrino luminosity from the original value @xmath23 for @xmath24 to the _ effective _ luminosity @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the distance from the center o and @xmath28 .",
    "the wind models considered in this study are listed in the first column of table  1 , where @xmath29 ( second column ) and @xmath25 ( third column ) are taken to be 10 , 12 , 15 , and 20  km , and 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , and 5.0 in units of @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting net heating rate ( @xmath31 ; _ top panel _ ) for models a1 , a5 , b5 , c5 , and d5 and each heating / cooling rate ( _ bottom panel _ ) for models a5 and b5 are shown in figure  2 , as functions of @xmath27 . note that a1-a5 are _ isotropic _ wind models ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) .    for isotropic winds ( a1-a5 in table  1 ) , the higher @xmath25 ( @xmath33 in these cases ) results in shorter dynamic timescale @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and _ lower _ asymptotic ( i.e. , maximum ) entropy @xmath36 .",
    "this shows that the increased @xmath31 ( see a1 and a5 in fig .  2 , _ top panel _",
    ") is consumed to drive more matter ( i.e. , higher @xmath11 as can be seen in table  1 ) from the neutron star surface with faster velocity , rather than to increase entropy .",
    "in contrast , for anisotropic models , an increase of @xmath25 ( for @xmath26 ) is quite efficient _ both _ to increase entropy and to reduce dynamic timescale ( table  1 ) .",
    "the reason is that the matter has been already lifted with low @xmath37 and thus with small @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the density ( and temperature ) at arbitrary @xmath27 is significantly small compared to the corresponding isotropic wind .",
    "this can be seen in the 5th ( and 6th ) column in table  1 , which lists the density @xmath38 ( and temperature @xmath39 ) at @xmath40 ( see about one order difference in @xmath38 for a5 and b5 ) .    for isotropic wind models , the five times greater",
    "neutrino luminosity simply results in the increase of @xmath31 with the same factor ( a1 and a5 in fig .  2 , _ top panel _ ) .",
    "this does not hold , however , for anisotropic wind models . for model b5 , the maximum @xmath31 is as twice large as that for model a5 ( with the same @xmath25 ) , and more than 10 times larger than that for model a1 ( with the same @xmath15 ) .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "as shown in figure  2 ( _ bottom panel _ ) , for isotropic winds ( _ dashed lines _ ; a5 ) , the heating is mainly due to @xmath6 and @xmath41 , while @xmath8 plays only a minor role .",
    "in contrast , for anisotropic winds ( _ solid lines _ ; b5 ) , the neutrino pair annihilation @xmath8 plays a crucial role , whose peak ( at @xmath42 ) is a factor of seven higher than that in a5 .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen in figure  2 ( _ top panel _ ) , in which the case without an increase of @xmath8 ( model  b5a ) and with an increase of @xmath8 only ( model  b5b ) are compared ( see also table  1 ) .",
    "this is due to the difference of @xmath43 and @xmath44 dependences in these heating terms . for a fixed set of @xmath27 , @xmath45 , @xmath15 and neutrino mean energies ,",
    "these heating rates are related to @xmath43 and @xmath44 such as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "@xmath6 in b5 ( fig .  2 , _ bottom panel _ ) closely follows that in a5 for @xmath49 , which is independent of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . as can be seen in table  1 , a reduction in @xmath43 owing to low @xmath15 in b5 (",
    "compared to that in a5 ) is accompanied with a reduction in @xmath44 . as a consequence , @xmath7 in b5",
    "is lower than that in a5 even for @xmath49 .",
    "however , @xmath8 is not dependent on @xmath44 but is inversely proportional to @xmath43 ( i.e. , proportional to the number of neutrinos per volume ) , which becomes significantly high owing to the decreasing @xmath43 for @xmath49 ( table  1 ) .",
    "note that the cooling terms ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) quickly decay with increasing @xmath27 and have negligible effects by the anisotropy ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "as can be seen in the above numerical experiments , the strong anisotropy in neutrino emission can be an additional energy source pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism may work only for @xmath52 , which is rather closer to the neutrino sphere than the suggested range ( @xmath53 ) by @xcite . in the current study ,",
    "the effects of increasing entropy and accelerating wind are prominent for the wind closer to the hot spot , in particular for @xmath54 ( table  1 ) , at which @xmath31 maximizes ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the effect of anisotropic neutrino emission becomes less important for a more distant wind ( e.g. , @xmath55 ) , where the neutrino heating has mostly ceased ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "for a fixed @xmath29 , the effect is more significant for higher @xmath25 as can be seen in table  1 . for model b5 ,",
    "the entropy is about @xmath0 higher ( @xmath56 ) and the dynamic timescale is about a factor of ten shorter ( @xmath57 ) than those in the isotropic model a1 with the same @xmath15 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "note that the purely parametric examinations explored in this section should be regarded as only qualitative ones .",
    "for instance , the `` hot spot '' is not necessary a point as illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "it is conceivable that the area with strong neutrino emission has some distribution on the neutrino sphere .",
    "moreover , the configuration should become multi - dimensional soon after the wind material passes the point p@xmath22 in figure  1 , which is treated within the framework of a spherical wind model in the current study .",
    "more realistically , the wind matter deviates from the radial to the direction of op@xmath22 in figure  1 .",
    "this may moderate the acceleration of wind and increase the heating duration .",
    "hence , the current results may overestimate the reduction of dynamic timescale and underestimate the increase of entropy .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the net effect to the nucleosynthesis from these modifications .",
    "obviously , a multi - dimensional approach will be needed to quantitatively estimate the effects of the anisotropy .",
    "adopting the wind trajectories discussed in   2 for the physical conditions ,",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields are obtained by solving an extensive nuclear reaction network .",
    "the network consists of 6300 species between the proton and neutron drip lines ( for more detail , see * ? ? ?",
    "neutrino - induced reactions and nuclear fission are not considered in the current study .",
    "each calculation is initiated when the temperature decreases to @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 ) .",
    "the initial compositions are given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the mass fractions of neutrons and protons , and @xmath66 is the initial electron fraction ( number of proton per nucleon ) at @xmath60 . in this study , @xmath66 is taken to be 0.4 , according to the core - collapse simulation in @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , the temperature and density are set to be constant when @xmath67 decreases to @xmath68 , in order to mimic the effect of the slower outgoing ejecta behind the shock .",
    "the nucleosynthesis results for models b2-b5 , c2-c5 , and d2-d5 ( table  1 ) are shown in figure  3 , as a function of atomic mass number . for anisotropic wind models with @xmath69 ( b2-b5 ) ,",
    "the effect of anisotropic neutrino emission is evident .",
    "a factor of three or four increase in @xmath25 ( b3 and b4 in table  1 ) leads to @xmath70 and @xmath71 , resulting in the _",
    "r_-process nucleosynthesis ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "for model b5 , the high entropy ( @xmath72 ) and short dynamic timescale ( @xmath73 ) of the wind drive the nuclear matter to the actinide region",
    ". the neutron - to - seed abundance ratio at the beginning of the _",
    "r_-process , defined as @xmath74 , is @xmath75 and the final averaged mass number of heavy nuclei with @xmath76 is @xmath77 ( table  1 ) .",
    "for the models with @xmath78 ( c2-c5 ) , the _ r_-process still takes place when @xmath25 is four or five times higher than @xmath15 ( models c4 and c5 ) . for @xmath55 ( d2-d5 ) , the effect of anisotropic",
    "neutrino emission is not important and the nucleosynthesis results are not significantly different from the isotropic cases ( a1-a5 ) .",
    "in this _ letter _ , the effects of anisotropy in neutrino emission for the _",
    "r_-process nucleosynthesis in proto - neutron - star winds were examined , using the spherically symmetric , steady outflow model of neutrino - driven winds .",
    "it was shown that strong anisotropy , _ if it exists _ , can be an additional energy source @xcite to heat the wind material .",
    "a factor of four or five enhancement in _ effective _ neutrino luminosity results in the significant increase of entropy and shortening of dynamic timescale of outgoing neutrino - heated ejecta .",
    "this is mainly due to the _ boosted _ neutrino heating from annihilation of neutrino - antineutrino pairs into electron - positron pairs as a result of anisotropic neutrino emission .",
    "this provides the physical condition suitable for the robust _ r_-process , producing the third abundance peak ( @xmath1 ) and beyond .",
    "it is conceivable that asymmetric neutrino emission can be associated with the anisotropic matter distribution near the neutrino sphere . as an example",
    ", @xcite suggested that the non - spherical neutrino sphere owing to rapid rotation leads to anisotropic neutrino heating with the pole - to - equator ratio of a few to more than 10 .",
    "this may result in strong contrast in neutrino emission on the neutrino sphere , which forms an _ effective _ `` hot spot '' around the rotational axis . a recent work with more sophisticated neutrino - transport scheme by @xcite showed , however , that the pole - to - equator flux ratio is at most a factor of two , even for a rather rapidly rotating core .",
    "this is a consequence that the radiation field is smoothened by the many neutrino sources above the neutrino sphere ( e.g. , convective bubbles ) at the early phase ( @xmath79 after core bounce ) .",
    "nevertheless , all the convective bubbles are evacuated during the late wind phase ( @xmath80 ) and a strong contrast of neutrino flux might form on the neutrino sphere for a rapidly rotating core .",
    "another possibility of anisotropic neutrino emission might be due a global fluid instabilities of neutrino - heated matter as observed in multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "recent works have shown that hydrodynamic instabilities can lead to low - mode ( @xmath81 in terms of an expansion in spherical harmonics of order @xmath82 ) oscillation of the convective fluid flow in the neutrino - heated layer behind the shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of such a low convective mode results in the pair of a single outflow and a narrow accretion flow that creates the `` hot spot '' on the neutron star surface .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the two - dimensional simulations by @xcite showed that the anisotropy of the accretion luminosity owing to this flow appears to be only a few percent ( at least during the early phase up to @xmath83 after core bounce ) . a future investigation relevant for the wind phase ( @xmath2 )",
    "will be needed to examine the degree of anisotropic neutrino emission from such an accretion flow .",
    "given one of the above ( or another unknown ) mechanism works , a constraint for the _ r_-process may be obtained from the condition that creates the `` hot spot '' owing to , e.g. , rapid rotation or long lasting accretion flow .",
    "it is conceivable that only a limited fraction of supernovae create the `` host spot '' relevant for the current scenario ( e.g. , rapid rotators or less - energetic supernovae that form the long lasting accretion flow ) .",
    "this can be a reasonable explanation for that the spectroscopic analysis of extremely metal - poor stars and galactic chemical evolution study imply only a limited fraction of core - collapse supernovae undergo the _",
    "r_-process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the implications in this study must be tested by future multi - dimensional simulations of core - collapse supernovae for long duration ( @xmath84 ) with accurate neutrino transport .",
    "systematic calculations of nucleosynthesis with such hydrodynamic trajectories will be also needed to investigate the contribution to the galactic chemical evolution of _ r_-process nuclei .",
