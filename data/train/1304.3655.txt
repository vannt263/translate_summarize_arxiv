    "when the virtual photon momentum exceeds the threshold of the pair creation , it becomes difficult to evaluate in the integral form as the integrand induces a complicated singular behavior originating from the pair creation of charged particles trapped in the magnetic field , where the charged particles are quantized in the landau - level .",

    "<S> hattori - itakura have recently derived the full landau - level summation form for the photon vacuum polarization tensor in constant external magnetic fields at the one - loop level . </S>",
    "<S> the landau - level summation form is essential when the photon momentum exceeds the threshold of the pair creation of charged particles in a magnetic field stronger than the squared mass of the charged particle . </S>",
    "<S> the tensor has three different form factors depending on the tensor direction with respect to the external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization is nontrivial because these form factors are expressed in terms of double or triple summation forms . </S>",
    "<S> we give a numerical uv subtraction method which can be applied to numerically evaluate the form factors in constant external magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically investigate the photon vacuum polarization tensor in the form of the landau - level summation and estimate the systematic errors coming from truncation of the landau - level summation in a parameter region realized in heavy ion collision experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the error is practically controllable at an @xmath0 level for electrons and muons in strong magnetic fields expected in heavy ion collisions in the experimentally feasible kinematic parameter regions . </S>"
