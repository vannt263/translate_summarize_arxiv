    "the gross properties of a star , such as broad - band colours and flux distributions , are significantly affected by the effects of convection in stars later than mid a - type .",
    "consequently , our modelling of convection in stellar atmosphere models can significantly alter our interpretation of observed phenomena . by comparison with stars of known @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 ( the fundamental stars ) , we can evaluate different treatments of convection in model atmosphere calculations .",
    "photometric indices are a fast and efficient method for determining approximate atmospheric parameters of stars . for the commonly - used strmgren @xmath2 system a vast body of observational data exists which can be used to estimate parameters using calibrated model grids ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* moon & dworetsky 1985 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smalley & dworetsky 1995 ) ) .",
    "conversely , knowing atmospheric parameters from other methods , allows observed colours to be compared to model predictions .",
    "this method has been used to compare various treatments of stellar convection .",
    "the effects of convection on the theoretical @xmath2 colours of a , f , and g stars was discussed by @xcite , who compared the predicted colours for the @xcite ( cm ) model with that from the standard @xcite mixing - length theory ( mlt ) models with and without `` approximate overshooting '' .",
    "comparison against fundamental @xmath0 and @xmath1 stars revealed that the cm models gave better agreement than mlt without overshooting .",
    "models with overshooting were clearly discrepant .",
    "this result was further supported by stars with @xmath0 obtained from the infrared flux method ( irfm ) and @xmath1 from stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the observed stellar flux distribution is influenced by the effects of convection on the atmospheric structure of the star . as we have seen with photometric colours ,",
    "these effects have a clearly observable signature ( see fig .",
    "[ smalley - fig ] ) . in their discussion of convection",
    "@xcite presented model stellar atmospheres using a modified mixing - length theory .",
    "they found small , systematic differences in the optical fluxes .",
    "their figures also demonstrate that convection can have a measurable effect on stellar fluxes .",
    "hence , high precision stellar flux measurements will provide significant and useful information on convection .",
    "= 7000k , @xmath1 = 4 models with cm and mlt ( @xmath3 = 0.5 and 1.25 ) , compared to that for a model with zero convection .",
    "note that the region 4000 @xmath4 5000  is especially sensitive and the effect of overshooting is considerable . ]",
    "unfortunately , very little high - precision stellar spectrophotometry exists .",
    "this situation will be rectified , once the astra spectrophotometer ( see below ) begins operation .",
    "this will allow spectrophotometry to be added to our observational diagnostic toolkit .",
    "the temperature sensitivity of balmer lines makes them an excellent diagnostic tool for late a - type stars and cooler . the @xmath5 and @xmath6 profiles behave differently due to convection :",
    "@xmath5 is significantly less sensitive to mixing - length than @xmath6 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vant veer & mgessier 1996 ) ) .",
    "both profiles are affected by the presence of overshooting .",
    "since @xmath5 is formed higher in the atmosphere than @xmath6 , balmer lines profiles are a very good depth probe of stellar atmospheres .",
    "balmer profiles are also affected by microturbulence , metallicity and , for hotter stars , surface gravity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* heiter  2002 ) ) .    in their comparison of balmer line profiles",
    ", @xcite found that both cm and mlt without overshooting gave satisfactory agreement with fundamental stars .",
    "overshooting was again found to be discrepant .",
    "in addition , @xcite found evidence for significant disagreement between all treatments of convection for stars with @xmath0 around 8000 @xmath4 9000  k. subsequently , @xcite reviewed this region using binary systems with known @xmath1 values and their revised fundamental @xmath0 values of the component stars .",
    "they found that the discrepancy found was no longer as evident .",
    "however , this region was relatively devoid of stars with fundamental values of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "further fundamental stars are clearly required in this region .",
    "the automated spectrophotometric telescope research associates ( astra ) have developed a cassegrain spectrophotometer and its automated 0.5-m f/16 telescope .",
    "there are being integrated at the fairborn observatory near nogales , arizona .",
    "scientific observations are expected to begin in 2007 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* adelman  2007 , smalley  2007 ) ) .    in an hour",
    "the system will obtain s / n = 200 ( after correction for instrumental errors ) observations of stars as faint as 9.5 mag .",
    "the spectrograph uses both a grating and a cross - dispersing prism to produce spectra from both the first and the second orders simultaneously .",
    "the square 30 arc second sky fields for each order do not overlap .",
    "the resolution is 7   in second and 14   in first order .",
    "the wavelength range is of approximately @xmath73300 - 9000 .",
    "the effects of convection on the stellar atmospheric structure can be successfully probed using a variety of observational diagnostics ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smalley 2004 ) ) .",
    "the combination of photometric colours and balmer - line profiles has given us a valuable insight into the nature of convection in stars .",
    "high quality observations that are currently available and those that will be in the near future , will enable further refinements in our theoretical models of convection and turbulence in stellar atmospheres ."
