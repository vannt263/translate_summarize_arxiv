    "the heterogeneous condensation of a vapor onto a substrate is a key step in a wide range of chemical and physical processes that occur in both nature and technology .",
    "for example , dust and pollutant aerosol particles , ranging in size from several microns down to just a few nanometers , serve as cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere  @xcite , while nanoscale structured surfaces provide templates for the controlled nucleation and growth of complex materials such as colloidal metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "the general principles of heterogeneous nucleation on bulk surfaces are well known  @xcite , but the details of how the process changes as the size of the heterogeneity becomes microscopic , and is the same size , or smaller , than the nanometer - sized fluctuations involved in the nucleation process itself , are not well understood .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have shown that vapor condensation onto small clusters and nanoparticles , with diameters of @xmath0 nm , occurs at supersaturations well below those predicted by classical nucleation theory  @xcite ( cnt ) and the kelvin relation , which suggests very small particles are far better at activating nucleation than expected .",
    "similarly , sear  @xcite found that a microscopic heterogeneity , consisting of a single fixed spin , was sufficient to accelerate the nucleation rate in a two - dimensional ising model by as much as four orders of magnitude .",
    "this raises interesting questions regarding how small a heterogeneity can be and still have an influence on nucleation and whether there are practical limits to our ability to study homogeneous nucleation in the presence of small concentrations of impurities .",
    "the work of forming a critical size cluster is the central ingredient of cnt .",
    "the phenomenological expression for the work of forming an @xmath1-sized embryo of the new phase can be generally written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the difference in chemical potential between the bulk stable and metastable phases and @xmath4 is a geometric constant that is dependent on the shape of the embryo and proportional to the interfacial surface tension , @xmath5 .",
    "the first term represents the free energy gained by moving particles from the metastable mother phase to the more stable phase and is negative , while the positive , second term accounts for the free energy cost of introducing an interface between the two phases .",
    "the functional form of eq .",
    "[ eq : dgcnt ] highlights the activated nature of the nucleation process and shows that embryos must overcome a free energy barrier , @xmath6 , associated with making a critical cluster of size @xmath7 , before they can grow spontaneously into the new phase .",

    ", nucleation can occur via a heterogeneous pathway .",
    "the nucleus then forms a droplet , contacting the wall with an angle , @xmath18 , that characterizes the interaction of the material with the wall and is related to the wall - liquid ( @xmath19 ) and wall - vapor ( @xmath20 ) surface tensions through young s equation , @xmath21 .",
    "the extension of cnt to heterogeneous nucleation by turnball  @xcite gives @xmath22 where @xmath23 is solely a function of the contact angle .",
    "eq  [ eq : ghet ] shows that the barrier is always reduced because the wall contributes a portion of the interfacial free energy . in the limit where the contact angle goes to @xmath24 ,",
    "the liquid is non - wetting and @xmath25 tends to one .",
    "nucleation then occurs homogeneously in the bulk .",
    "if the liquid and surface are highly attractive so the liquid completely wets the wall , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , causing the barrier to go to zero . despite the extremely simplified approach involved in cnt",
    ", recent simulation studies of heterogeneous nucleation in hard spheres colloids  @xcite and the ising model  @xcite have shown that eq .",
    "[ eq : ghet ] is generally correct , as long as an additional term involving the three - phase contact line tension is included in @xmath28 .",
    "cnt also suggests that as the heterogeneity becomes more microscopic its ability to activate nucleation is greatly reduced  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work is to quantify the effect of a very small seed particle on the condensation of the lennard - jones ( lj ) vapor , by measuring both the nucleation rate and free energy barrier associated with heterogeneous nucleation , and compare the results with a simple thermodynamic model .",
    "homogeneous nucleation in the lj system has been studied by simulation  @xcite , as has heterogeneous nucleation on macroscopic surfaces  @xcite .",
    "however , studies involving small , seed particles in the lj vapor have focused on examining the qualitative effects of highly attractive seeds , i.e. where the vapor - seed interaction is in the order of being ten times more attractive than the vapor - vapor interaction  @xcite . by studying the impact of seeds with interactions very similar to those of the vapor phase , we hope to understand how small heterogeneities perturb the bulk system .",
    "we can then directly address the question as to whether small impurities can seriously impact our ability to measure homogeneous nucleation rates , as well as assess the ability of cnt to predict heterogeneous nucleation on seed particles .",

    "the obvious result is that the presence of the heterogeneity allows nucleation to occur faster , but when the attraction between the seed and the vapor is only marginally more attractive than the vapor - vapor interaction , we see the work of forming small clusters is essentially unchanged and the free energy is only lowered for the larger clusters .",

    "larger clusters are rarer and the energetic advantage of including the seed in a cluster increases because it can have more neighbors .",

    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : traje15 ] suggests the height of the nucleation barrier and the rate should remain unaffected because the seed is always part of the cluster that goes over the barrier and it is part of this cluster long before it reaches the critical size . as a result ,",
    "the mfpt of the larger clusters will not change and neither should the probability of finding the larger clusters within the ensemble of runs .",
    "the work of forming the smaller clusters would be expected to increase , as the probability of finding monomers and dimers etc decreases relative to the homogeneous case and the probability of finding no liquid - like atoms connected to the seed increases .",
    "we also wished to make some quantitative assessment of the affect small heterogeneities may have on our ability to measure homogeneous nucleation .",
    "the presence of a single seed in the current simulations changes the rate of nucleation by one or two orders of magnitude , but it is important to note that we have relatively high concentration of heterogeneities in our system and we would expect , on the basis of the entropic arguments presented above , that the effect should decrease as the concentration of heterogeneities decreases .    finally , the comparison of our simulation results with those of our model show that the simple capillarity base approach suffers the same degree of failure in heterogeneous nucleation as it does in the homogeneous case .",
    "the models are able to make relatively good predictions concerning the size of the critical nucleus but not the height of the barrier .",
    "nevertheless , the model does capture the general features of heterogeneous nucleation , demonstrating both a spinodal limit in the supersaturation for a fixed sized heterogeneity and a critical size of activation , where the barrier to nucleation goes to zero for a completely wetting system above a certain size heterogeneity .",
    "there are also many corrections that could be introduced to the model to account for the small size of the system , such as size dependent surface tensions or the disjoining pressure , which provides a thermodynamic description of the interaction of the interfaces in a very thin film , that will probably lead to some improvement in the agreement . however , the very concepts of surface wetting and contact angle become poorly defined when describing processes involving heterogeneities that are of the small size considered here and more molecular approaches may be needed to describe nanoscale heterogeneous nucleation accurately .",

    "<S> the heterogeneous condensation of a lennard - jones vapor onto a nanoscale seed particle is studied using molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the nucleation rate and the height of the free energy barrier using the mean first passage time method shows that the presence of a weakly interacting seed has little effect on the work of forming very small cluster embryos but accelerates the rate by lowering the barrier for larger clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this results from a competition between the energetic and entropic features of cluster formation in the bulk and at the heterogeneity . as the interaction </S>",
    "<S> is increased , the free energy of formation is reduced for all cluster sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop a simple phenomenological model of film formation on a small seed that captures the general features of the nucleation process for small heterogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of our simulation results with the model shows that heterogeneous classical nucleation theory provides a good estimate of the critical size of the film but significantly over - estimates the size of the barrier . </S>"
