    "the competition between the kondo effect and inter - moment exchange determines the physics of a large class of materials which have localized magnetic moments coupled to a separate set of conduction electron  @xcite .",
    "when the kondo effect dominates , the low - energy physics is well described by fermi liquid theory ( albeit with heavily renormalized quasiparticle masses ) .",
    "in contrast when the inter - moment exchange dominates , ordered magnetism typically results .",
    "a remarkable experimental property of such magnetic states is that the magnetism is often very weak  the ordered moment per site is much smaller than the microscopic local moment that actually occupies each site .",
    "the traditional explanation of this feature is that the magnetism arises out of imperfectly kondo - screened local moments . in other words ,",
    "the magnetism is to be viewed as a spin density wave that develops out of the parent heavy fermi liquid state .",
    "we will henceforth denote such a state as sdw .",
    "clearly a sdw state may be a small moment magnet .",
    "a different kind of magnetic metallic state is also possible in heavy - fermion materials where the moments order at relatively large energy scales , and simply do not participate in the fermi surface of the metal . in such a situation , the saturation moment in the ordered state would naively be large , _",
    "i.e. _ , of order the atomic moment .    often the distinction between these two kinds of magnetic states can be made sharply : the two fermi surfaces in the two states may have different topologies ( albeit , the same volume modulo the volume of the brillouin zone of the ordered state ) , so that they can not be smoothly connected to one another .",
    "in recent years , a number of experiments have unearthed some fascinating phenomena near the zero temperature ( @xmath0 ) quantum transition between the heavy - fermion liquid and the magnetic metal .",
    "in particular , many experiments do not fit easily @xcite into a description in terms of an effective gaussian theory for the spin density wave fluctuations , renormalized self - consistently by quartic interactions @xcite .",
    "this theory makes certain predictions on deviations from fermi liquid behavior as the heavy fermi liquid state approaches magnetic ordering induced by the condensation of the spin density wave mode ; those predictions are , however , in disagreement with experimental findings .",
    "this conflict raises the possibility that the magnetic state being accessed is not in the first category discussed above : a sdw emerging from a heavy fermi liquid .",
    "rather , it may be the second kind of magnetic metal where the local moments do not participate at all in the fermi surface .",
    "in other words , the experiments suggest that the kondo effect ( crucial in forming the fermi liquid state ) is itself suppressed on approaching the magnetic state .",
    "this proposal clearly raises several serious puzzles . how do we correctly describe the non - fermi liquid physics near the transition ?",
    "if this non - fermi liquid behavior is accompanied by the suppression of the kondo effect , how do we reconcile it with the weak moments found in the magnetic state ?",
    "the traditional explanation for the weak magnetism is apparently in conflict with the picture that the kondo effect and the resultant heavy fermi liquid state are destroyed on approaching the magnetic state . in other words ,",
    "the naive expectation of a large saturation moment in a magnetic metal where the local moments do not participate in the fermi surface must be revisited .",
    "the weakness of the ordered moment in the magnetic state may be reconciled with the apparent suppression of the kondo effect if we assume that there are strong quantum fluctuations of the spins that reduce their moment .",
    "such strong quantum effects may appear to be unusual in three - dimensional systems , but may be facilitated by the coupling to the conduction electrons ( even if there is no actual kondo screening ) . in this paper",
    "we study specific states where such quantum fluctuations have significantly reduced the ordered moment ( or even caused it to vanish ) , and the evolution of such states to the heavy fermi liquid .",
    "we begin with several general pertinent observations .",
    "first , consider the heavy fermi liquid state . this fermi liquid behavior is accompanied by a fermi surface which , remarkably , satisfies luttinger s theorem only if the local moments are included as part of the electron count .",
    "( such a fermi surface is often referred to as the `` large fermi surface '' , and we will henceforth refer to such a phase as fl ) .",
    "the absorption of the local moments into the fermi volume is the lattice manifestation of the kondo screening of the moments .",
    "we take as our starting point the assumption that the kondo effect becomes suppressed on approaching the magnetic state .",
    "what then happens to the large fermi surface ?    in thinking about the resulting state theoretically , it is important to realize that once magnetic order sets in , there is no sharp distinction between a large fermi volume which includes the local moments , and a fermi volume that excludes the local moments  the latter is often loosely referred to as `` small '' .",
    "this is because the fermi volumes can only be defined modulo the volume of the brillouin zone , and the onset of magnetic order at least doubles the unit cell and hence at least halves the brillouin zone volume .",
    "( there can , however , be a distinction between the fermi surfaces topologies in the two situations . )    in this paper we will take the point of view that the primary transition involves the destruction of the large fermi surface , and that the resulting small fermi surface state has a distinct physical meaning even in the absence of magnetic order .",
    "the magnetic order will be viewed as a low - energy instability of the resulting state in which the local moments are not to be included in the fermi volume .",
    "evidence in support of this point of view exists . in the experiments the non - fermi liquid behavior extends to temperatures well above the neel ordering temperature even far away from the critical point .",
    "this suggests that the fluctuations responsible for the non - fermi liquid behavior have very little to do with the fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter .",
    "some further support is provided by the results of inelastic neutron scattering experiments that apparently see critical behavior at a range of wave - vectors including ( but not restricted to ) the one associated with magnetic ordering in the magnetic metal @xcite .",
    "finally , there even exist materials in which the non - fermi liquid features persist into the magnetically ordered side  this is difficult to understand if the non - fermi liquid physics is attributed to critical fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter .    conceptually",
    ", as we asserted above , it pays to allow for the possibility of a non - magnetic state in which the suppression of the kondo effect removes the local moments from the fermi volume , resulting in a `` small fermi surface '' , even though such a state may not actually be a ground state in the system of interest . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we argued that such states do exist as ground states of kondo lattice models in regular @xmath1-dimensional lattices , and that the violation of luttinger s theorem in such a state was intimately linked to the presence of neutral @xmath2 and @xmath3 excitations induced by topological order ( see also appendix  [ oshi ] ) : we dubbed such ground states fl@xmath4 .",
    "clearly , it is worthwhile to explore metallic magnetic states that develop out of such fl@xmath4 states ( just as the usual sdw state develops out of the fermi liquid ) .",
    "such states , which we will denote sdw@xmath4 , represent a third class of metallic magnetic states distinct from both the conventional sdw and the conventional local - moment metal described above .",
    "as we will see , in such magnetic states the local moments do not participate in the fermi surface .",
    "nevertheless they may have a weak ordered moment .",
    "thus these states offer an opportunity for resolution of the puzzles mentioned above . the properties and the evolution of such states , and their parent fl@xmath4 states , to the fermi liquid will be the subject of this paper .",
    "the sdw@xmath4 states inherit neutral spin @xmath2 spinon excitations and @xmath3 `` gauge '' excitations from the fl@xmath4 states , which will be described more precisely below ; these excitations coexist with the magnetism and the metallic behavior .",
    "the experimental distinction between the sdw and sdw@xmath4 states is however subtle , and will also be described in this paper .",
    "( the fl and fl@xmath4 states can be easily distinguished by the volumes of the fermi surfaces , but this distinction does not extend to the sdw and sdw@xmath4 states . )    we emphasize that a wide variety of heavy - fermion materials display non - fermi liquid physics in the vicinity of the onset of magnetism that is , to a considerable extent , universal .",
    "however , the detailed behavior at very low temperature appears to vary across different systems . in particular , in some materials a direct transition to the magnetic state at very low temperature does not occur ( due for instance to intervention of a superconducting state ) . in other materials ,",
    "such a direct transition does seem to occur at currently accessible temperatures .",
    "in view of this , we will not attempt to predict the detailed phase diagram at ultra - low temperatures .",
    "we focus instead on understanding the universal non - fermi liquid physics not too close to the transition and its relation to the magnetic state .",
    "our analysis is based upon non - magnetic translation - invariant states that have a small fermi surface ( fl@xmath4 ) , and the related transitions to the heavy fermi liquid ( fl ) . as we showed previously @xcite",
    ", the fl@xmath4 state has a fermi surface of long - lived electron - like quasiparticles whose volume does not count the local moments .",
    "the local moments are instead in a state adiabatically connected to a spin - liquid state with emergent gauge excitations .",
    "such spin liquids can be classified by the gauge group determining the quantum numbers carried by the neutral @xmath2 spinon excitations and the gauge excitations , and previous work  @xcite has shown that the most prominent examples are @xmath5 and u(1 ) spin liquids .",
    "the @xmath5 spin liquids are stable in all spatial dimensions @xmath6 , while the u(1 ) spin liquids exist only in @xmath7 ( the latter correspond to the existence of a coulomb phase in a compact u(1 ) gauge theory in @xmath8 , as discussed in ref .  ) .",
    "correspondingly , we also have the metallic @xmath5 fl@xmath4 and u(1 ) fl@xmath4 states .",
    "our previous work  @xcite considered primarily the @xmath5 fl@xmath4 state , whereas here we focus on the u(1 ) fl@xmath4 state .",
    "as we have already discussed , these non - magnetic states may lead to magnetic order at low energies , or in proximate states in a generalized phase diagram . in this manner",
    "the fl state leads to the sdw state , while the fl@xmath4 states lead to the @xmath5 sdw@xmath4 and the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 states .",
    "the relation between the metallic sdw and sdw@xmath4 states has a parallel to that between the insulating nel state and the af@xmath4 state of refs .  .",
    "we will also discuss the evolution from the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 state to the conventional fermi liquid . as explained earlier",
    ", the underlying transition is that between fl and fl@xmath4 states which controls the nature of the fermi surface . in ref .",
    ", we argued that the spinon pairing in the @xmath5 fl@xmath4 state implied that there must be a superconducting state in between the fl and @xmath5 fl@xmath4 states .",
    "there is no such pairing in the u(1 ) fl@xmath4 state , and hence there is the possibility of a direct transition between the fl and u(1 ) fl@xmath4 states : this transition and the nature of the states flanking it are the foci of our paper .",
    "note that the volume of the fermi surface _ jumps _ at this transition .",
    "nevertheless the transition may be second order .",
    "this is made possible by the vanishing of the quasiparticle residue on an entire portion of the fermi surface ( a `` hot '' fermi surface ) on approaching the transition from the fl side .",
    "non - fermi liquid physics is clearly to be expected at such a second order fermi - volume changing transition .",
    "we reiterate that the u(1 ) fl@xmath4 state is only believed to exist in @xmath9 .",
    "we study the fl and u(1 ) fl@xmath4 states by the `` slave '' boson method , introduced in the context of the single - moment kondo problem  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the condensation of the slave boson marks the onset of kondo coherence that characterizes the fl phase .",
    "in contrast the slave boson is not condensed in the fl@xmath4 phase .",
    "fluctuations about this mean - field description lead to the critical theory of the transition involving a propagating boson coupled to a compact u(1 ) gauge field , in the presence of damping from fermionic excitations .",
    "we note that earlier studies  @xcite of single - impurity problems found a temperature - induced mean - field transition between a state in which the slave boson is condensed ( and hence the local moment is kondo screened ) and a state in which the boson has no condensate : however , it was correctly argued that this transition is an artifact of the mean - field theory , and no sharp transition exists in the single - moment kondo problem at @xmath10 .",
    "if we now naively generalize this single - impurity model to the lattice , we will find that the @xmath11 ground state always has kondo screening .",
    "it is only upon including frustrating inter - moment exchange interactions  equivalent to having `` dispersing '' spinons  that it is possible to breakdown kondo screening and reach a state in which the slave boson is not condensed .",
    "this transition is not an artifact of mean - field theory , we show here that it remains sharply defined in @xmath12 .",
    "our analysis of the above @xmath12 u(1 ) gauge theory leads to the schematic crossover phase diagram as a function of the kondo exchange @xmath13 and @xmath0 shown in fig  [ cross ] .    the crossover phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ cross ] is similar to that of a dilute bose gas as a function of chemical potential and temperature @xcite . here",
    "the bosons are coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field , and this is important for many of the critical properties to be described in the body of the paper .",
    "notably , in fig .  [ cross ] the density of bosons is _ not _ fixed , and varies as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath13 and other couplings in the hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , the contours of constant boson density have a complicated structure , which are similar to those in ref .  .",
    "this variation in the boson density is a crucial distinction from earlier analyses  @xcite of boson models coupled to damped u(1 ) gauge fields : in these earlier works , the boson density was fixed at a @xmath0-independent value . as we will see , allowing the boson density to vary changes the critical properties , and has significant consequences for the structure of the crossover phase diagram and for the @xmath0 dependence of observables .",
    "we will show that non - fermi liquid physics obtains in the quantum critical region of this transition .",
    "furthermore , we argue that fluctuation effects may lead to a spin density wave developing out of the spinon fermi surface of the u(1 ) fl@xmath4 phase , thereby obtaining the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 phase . the expected phase diagram and crossovers for the evolution from the u(1 )",
    "sdw@xmath4 phase to the fl phase is shown in fig .",
    "[ qcusdw ] .",
    "we examine few different kinds of such u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 phases depending on the details of the spinon fermi surface .",
    "we also describe a number of specific experimental signatures of the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 phase which may help to distinguish it from more conventional magnetic metals .",
    "we have already mentioned a number of precursors to our ideas in our discussion so far . here , we complete this by noting some other related developments in the literature .",
    "early on , andrei and coleman @xcite and kagan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of the decoupling of local moments and conduction electrons in kondo lattice models .",
    "andrei and coleman had the local moments in a spin - liquid state which is unstable to u(1 ) gauge fluctuations , and did not notice violation of luttinger s theorem .",
    "the possibility of small electronic fermi surfaces was noted by kagan _",
    "et al . _ , but no connection was made to the requirement this imposes on emergent gauge excitations @xcite .",
    "more recently , burdin _ et al .",
    "_ described many aspects of the physics we are interested in a dynamical mean - field theory of a random kondo lattice  @xcite . in this work",
    ", they obtained a state in which local moments formed a spin liquid and stayed essentially decoupled from the conduction electrons .",
    "they emphasized that the transition between such a state ( which is the analog of our fl@xmath14 states ) and a conventional heavy fermi liquid ( the fl state ) should be understood as a fermi volume changing transition .",
    "however questions of emergent gauge structure were not addressed by them .",
    "demler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite discussed fractionalized phases of kondo lattice models .",
    "however , they did not consider any states with long - lived electron - like quasiparticles , as are present in the fl@xmath4 phase .",
    "recently essler and tsvelik @xcite discussed the fate of one - dimensional mott insulator under a particular long - range inter - chain hopping . at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "they obtain a state with a small fermi surface , in that the fermi surface volume does not count the local moments @xcite .",
    "however , their construction does not lead to a state with emergent gauge excitations in higher dimensions , and as they conclude , their state is unstable to magnetic order at low temperatures .",
    "we believe this low-@xmath0 state is an ordinary sdw state , and any realizations of small fermi surfaces at intermediate temperatures are remnants of one - dimensional physics .",
    "in contrast , all our constructions are genuinely higher - dimensional , and only work for @xmath6 .",
    "the physics of the destruction of the large fermi surface by the vanishing of kondo screening has been addressed in interesting recent works  @xcite using an `` extended dynamical mean - field theory '' .",
    "we have argued in our discussion above that vanishing of kondo screening is conceptually quite a different transition from the onset of magnetic order ; consistent with this expectation , sun and kotliar @xcite found two distinct points associated with these transitions .",
    "it is our contention that the critical theory of the fl to u(1 ) fl@xmath4 transition ( discussed in the present paper ) is the @xmath12 realization of the large - dimensional critical point with vanishing kondo screening found by sun and kotliar .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ flstar ] , we briefly review the properties of various fractionalized fermi liquids ( fl@xmath4 ) .",
    "a specific u(1 ) fl@xmath4 state where the spinons form a fermi surface is considered . in section [ mft ]",
    ", we construct a mean - field description of this state and its transition to the heavy fermi liquid .",
    "this transition involves a jump in the fermi surface volume but is nevertheless shown to be second order within the mean - field theory .",
    "this is made possible by the vanishing of the quasiparticle residue @xmath15 on an entire fermi surface ( a `` hot '' fermi surface ) as one moves from the heavy fermi liquid to the fractionalized fermi liquid .",
    "fluctuations about this mean - field description are then considered . in section [ fluct ] ,",
    "we first consider fluctuation effects on the phases  in particular the fl@xmath4 phase .",
    "we argue that the specific heat coefficient @xmath16 diverges logarithmically once the leading - order fluctuations are included .",
    "furthermore , fluctuations also make possible a spin density wave instability of the spinon fermi surface , leading to a u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 state .",
    "to illustrate possible phases , we will discuss an improved mean - field theory which includes the sdw order parameter , and present phase diagrams showing the influence of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "we then examine fluctuation effects at the critical point of the transition between fl@xmath4 and fl in section [ flcrt ] .",
    "we argue that the logarithmic divergence of the specific heat coefficient persists in the quantum critical region , and also that non - fermi liquid transport obtains there . in section [ sdwstar ]",
    ", we discuss the properties of the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 phase in greater detail with particular attention to its identification in experiments .",
    "a discussion of the implications for various experiments in sec .",
    "[ disc ] will conclude the paper .",
    "the existence of non - magnetic translation invariant `` small fermi surface '' states was shown in a recent article by us @xcite with a focus on two - dimensional kondo lattices .",
    "such states were obtained when the local - moment system settles into a fractionalized spin liquid ( rather than a magnetically ordered state ) due to inter - moment interactions .",
    "a weak kondo coupling to conduction electrons does not disrupt the structure of the spin liquid but leaves a sharp fermi surface of quasiparticles whose volume counts the conduction electron density alone ( a small fermi surface ) .",
    "thus these states have fractionalized excitations that coexist with conventional fermi - liquid - like quasiparticle excitations .",
    "we dubbed these states fl@xmath4 ( to distinguish them from the conventional fermi liquid fl ) .",
    "we also pointed out an intimate connection between the disappearance of the large fermi surface and fractionalization , and this is discussed further in appendix  [ oshi ] .",
    "the fl@xmath4 phase can be further classified by the nature of the spin liquid formed by the local moments .",
    "recent years have seen considerable progress in our understanding of fractionalized spin liquids .",
    "an important feature of spin liquid states in @xmath6 is that they possess emergent gauge structure .",
    "put simply , this means that the distinct excitations in such phases interact with each other through long ranged interactions which can be mathematically encapsulated as gauge interactions . in other words ,",
    "the effective field theory of the state is a gauge theory in its deconfined phase .",
    "the two natural possibilities are that the emergent gauge group is either @xmath5 or u(1 ) .",
    "the former is allowed in any dimension @xmath6 while the latter is only allowed in @xmath17 ( or higher ) .",
    "the @xmath5 states have been discussed at length in the literature and in the present context in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the u(1 ) states have not been discussed much , though their possible occurrence ( in @xmath17 ) and their universal properties have been appreciated by many workers in the field .",
    "we therefore provide a quick discussion : the distinct excitations in the @xmath17 u(1 ) spin liquid phases are neutral spin-@xmath18 spinons , a gapless ( emergent ) gauge photon , and a gapped point defect ( the `` monopole '' ) .",
    "the spinons are minimally coupled to the photon and hence interact through emergent long ranged interactions . for simple microscopic models that realize such phases ,",
    "see ref .  .",
    "a crucial distinction between the @xmath5 spin liquids is that the spinons in this phase are _ not _ generically paired , _",
    "i.e. _ , the spinon number is conserved  @xcite .",
    "several classes of spin liquids are theoretically possible with the same gauge structure .",
    "these may be characterized by the statistics of the spinons , their band structure , etc . for the rest of this paper",
    ", we will focus on a particular three - dimensional u(1 ) spin liquid state with fermionic spinons that form a fermi surface . a specific toy model which displays this phase",
    "is presented in appendix  [ toy ] .    as with the @xmath5 spin liquids discussed in ref .",
    ", the gauge structure in the u(1 ) spin liquid state is also stable to a weak kondo coupling to conduction electrons  @xcite .",
    "the resulting u(1 ) fl@xmath4 state consists of a spinon fermi surface coexisting with a separate fermi surface of conduction electrons .",
    "there will also be gapless photon and gapped monopole excitations . the physical electron fermi surface ( as measured by de - haas van alphen experiments for instance )",
    "will have a small volume that is determined by the conduction electrons alone .    in our previous work , we pointed out that the transition from a @xmath5 fl@xmath4 phase to the heavy fl will generically be preempted by superconductivity .",
    "this is due to the pairing of spinons in the @xmath5 phase .",
    "in contrast , we expect that due to conservation of spinon number a direct transition between the u(1 ) fl@xmath4 and heavy fl phases should be possible .",
    "a simple mean - field theory allows a description both of a u(1 ) fl@xmath4 phase and its transition to the heavy fl . consider a three - dimensional kondo - heisenberg model , for concreteness on a cubic lattice : @xmath19 here @xmath20 represent the conduction electrons and @xmath21 the spin-@xmath18 local moments on the sites of a cubic lattice , summation over repeated spin indices @xmath22 is implicit .",
    "we use a fermionic `` slave - particle '' representation of the local moments : @xmath23 where @xmath24 describes a spinful fermion destruction operator at site @xmath25 .    proceeding as usual",
    ", we consider a decoupling of both the kondo and heisenberg exchange using two auxiliary fields in the particle - hole channel .",
    "treating the fluctuations of these auxiliary fields by a saddle point approximation ( formally justified for a large-@xmath26 su(@xmath26 ) generalization ) , we obtain the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath27 where we assumed @xmath28 and @xmath29 to be real , and have dropped additional constants to @xmath30 . the mean - field parameters @xmath31 are determined by the conditions @xmath32 in the last equation @xmath33 are nearest neighbors .",
    "there are two qualitatively different zero - temperature phases .",
    "first , there is the usual fermi liquid ( fl ) phase when @xmath31 are all non - zero .",

    "( in this phase @xmath38 . )",
    "this mean - field state represents a situation where the conduction electrons are decoupled from the local moments and form a _ small _ fermi surface .",
    "the local - moment system is described as a spin fluid with a fermi surface of neutral spinons .",
    "we expect that @xmath39 .",
    "the transition between these two different states can also be examined within the mean - field theory .",
    "interestingly , the transition is second order ( despite the jump in fermi volume ) and is described by @xmath40 on approaching it from the fermi liquid side .",
    "how can a second order transition be associated with a jump in the volume of the electron fermi surface ? this can be understood by examining the fermi surfaces closely in this mean - field theory .",

    ". we will call the former the @xmath52-band and the latter the @xmath53-band . for small @xmath50 , both bands intersect the fermi energy so that the fermi surface consists of two sheets ( see fig .  [",

    "the longitudinal gauge field propagator has a structure very similar to that of a standard rpa density fluctuation propagator , and so does not lead to any non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "the repulsive interaction mediated by the longitudinal part of the gauge interaction can lead to various instabilities of the spinon fermi surface .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to consider an sdw instability of the spinon fermi surface .",
    "the resulting state will have magnetic long range order that could potentially have a weak moment as it is an sdw state that is formed out of the spinon fermi surface .",
    "however , in contrast to the traditional view of the weak magnetism , here the sdw instability is _ not _ that of the large fermi surface heavy fermi liquid . despite the occurrence of magnetic long range order ,",

    "so to reiterate , the exotic magnetic metal , dubbed u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 , emerges as a low - energy instability of the spinon fermi surface of the parent u(1 ) fl@xmath4 state .",
    "different possibilities emerge for the formation of the spin density wave out of the parent u(1 ) fl@xmath4 phase , depending on the details of the spinon fermi surface and the strength of the interactions driving the sdw instability .",
    "we enumerate some of them below :    * \\(a ) perfectly nested spinon fermi surface : + in this case , arbitrarily weak interactions will drive an sdw instability . in the resulting state",
    ", the spinons are gapped .",
    "so upon integrating out the spinons , the effective action for the gauge field can be expanded safely in spatial and temporal gradients , with no long - range couplings .",
    "gauge invariance now demands that these terms in the gauge field action have the standard maxwell form .",
    "consequently , the photon becomes a sharp propagating mode at low energies ( below the spinon gap ) with linear dispersion . despite clearly being a distinct phase from conventional spin density wave metals ,",
    "the experimental distinction is subtle . *",
    "\\(b ) generic spinon fermi surface , weak interaction : + for a generic spinon fermi surface , the leading spin density wave instability ( which will require an interaction strength beyond some threshold value ) will be at a wavevector that matches one of the `` @xmath82 '' wavevectors of the spinon fermi surface . in the resulting state",
    ", a portion of the spinon fermi surface ( away from points connected by the ordering wavevector ) survives intact .",
    "the damping of the gapless u(1 ) gauge fluctuations due to coupling to gapless spinons is preserved .",

    "it is extremely important to realize that the emergent gauge structure of a fractionalized phase is completely robust to all local perturbations , and is not to be confused with any modes associated with broken symmetries .",
    "thus despite its gaplessness the photon is not a goldstone mode .",
    "in fact , the gaplessness of the photon is _ protected _ even if there are small terms in the microscopic hamiltonian that break global spin rotation invariance .",
    "being gapless with a linear dispersion , the photons will contribute a @xmath192 specific heat at low @xmath0 which will add to similar contributions from the magnons and the phonons of the crystal lattice .",
    "in addition , the conduction electrons will contribute a linear @xmath0 term .",
    "the phonon contribution is presumably easily subtracted out by a comparison between the heavy fermi liquid and magnetic phases . to disentangle the magnon and photon contributions , it may be useful to exploit the robustness of the photons to perturbations .",
    "thus for materials with an easy - plane anisotropy , application of an in - plane magnetic field will gap out the single magnon , but the photon will stay gapless and will essentially be unaffected ( at weak fields )",
    ". thus careful measurements of field - dependent specific heat may perhaps be useful in deciding whether the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 phase is realized .",
    "finally , quasi - elastic raman scattering has been suggested as a probe of the u(1 ) gauge field fluctuations @xcite in the context of the cuprates  the same prediction applies essentially unchanged here to the fractionalized phases in @xmath12 .",
    "conceptually the cleanest signature of the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 phase would be detection of the gapped monopole . however at present",
    "we do not know how this may be directly done in experiments .",
    "designing such a `` monopole detection '' experiment is an interesting open problem .",
    "the primary question which motivates this paper is how to reconcile a weak moment magnetic metal with non - fermi liquid behavior close to the transition to the fermi liquid .",
    "we have explored one concrete route toward such a reconciliation .",
    "the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 magnetic states discussed in this paper may be dubbed spin - charge separated spin density wave metals .",
    "they constitute a class distinct from both the conventional spin density wave metal and the local - moment metal mentioned in the introduction .",
    "however , they share a number of similarities with both conventional metals . just as in the conventional local - moment",
    "metal , in the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 state the local moments do not participate in the fermi surface . despite this the ordering moment",
    "may be very small .",
    "indeed this state may be viewed as a spin density wave that has formed out of a parent non - magnetic metallic state with a `` small fermi surface '' .",
    "this parent state is a fractionalized fermi liquid in which the local moments have settled into a spin liquid and essentially decoupled from the conduction electrons .",
    "the spinons of the spin liquid form a fermi surface which undergoes the sdw transition  this transition does not affect the deconfinement property of the gauge field , because the sdw order parameter is gauge neutral and thus does not effectively couple to the gauge field excitations .",
    "we showed that in the region of evolution from this state to the conventional fermi liquid , non - fermi liquid behavior obtains ( at least at intermediate temperatures ) .",
    "we also argued that the underlying transition that leads to this non - fermi liquid physics is the fermi volume changing transition from fl to fl@xmath4 . despite the jump in the fermi volume ,",
    "this transition is continuous and characterized by the vanishing of the quasiparticle residue @xmath15 on an entire sheet of the fermi surface ( the `` hot '' fermi surface ) on approaching the transition from the fl side .",
    "a specific heat that behaves as @xmath193 is commonly observed in a variety of heavy - fermion materials close to the transition to magnetism . in the context of the ideas explored in this paper , such behavior of the specific heat is naturally obtained in _ three - dimensional _ systems . a small number of heavy - fermion materials exhibit such a singular specific heat even in the presence of long - ranged magnetic order .",
    "as we have emphasized , precisely such non - fermi liquid specific heat obtains in one of the exotic magnetic metals discussed in this paper ( the u(1 ) sdw@xmath4 phase with a partially gapped spinon fermi surface ) .",
    "it would be interesting to check for violations of the wiedemann - franz law at low temperature in such materials .",
    "a general point emphasized in this paper is that the observed non - fermi liquid physics near the onset of magnetism actually has little to do with fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter .",
    "rather we propose that the non - fermi liquid physics is associated with the destruction of the large fermi surface .",
    "the concrete realization of this picture explored in this paper is that the destruction of the large fermi surface leads to a fractionalized fermi liquid which eventually ( at low temperature ) develops spin density wave order . as we discussed extensively",
    ", the resulting spin density wave state is an exotic magnetic metal .",
    "it is also of interest to consider a different scenario in which the small fermi surface state is unstable at low temperature toward _ confinement _ of spinons and magnetic order .",
    "it is particularly interesting to consider such a scenario in @xmath72 .",
    "the physics of the fermi - volume changing fluctuations is again described by a theory of condensation of a slave boson field coupled to a fermi surface of spinons by a u(1 ) gauge field . for a non - compact u(1 ) gauge field , such a theory has a number of interesting properties . as noticed by altshuler _",

    "@xcite , the spin susceptibility at extremal wavevectors of the spinon fermi surface have ( possibly divergent ) singularities due to the gauge fluctuations .",
    "indeed the spin physics of this model is critical and described by a non - trivial fixed point .",
    "the dynamical susceptibility at these extremal wavevectors and at a frequency @xmath194 is expected to satisfy @xmath195 scaling . for",
    "a general spinon fermi surface these extremal wavevectors will chart out one - dimensional lines in the brillouin zone at which critical scattering will be seen in inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "a spin density wave instability can develop out of this critical state at a particular extremal wavevector where the amplitude of the diverging susceptibility is the largest .",
    "arguments very similar to those in section [ pd ] also show that transport will be governed by non - fermi liquid power laws in this theory .",
    "there is a striking _ qualitative _ resemblance between these results and the experiments on cecu@xmath196au@xmath197 . at the critical au concentration neutron scattering experiments",

    "magnetic ordering occurs at particular wavevectors on this line .",

    "indeed , the influence of an insertion of flux @xmath221 is closely analogous to the transformation in the lieb - schultz - mattis  @xcite argument , and it was shown  @xcite that a spin liquid state in @xmath117 acquires the momentum change @xmath222 where the second factor on the r.h.s .",
