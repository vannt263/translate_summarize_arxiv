    "one of the most fundamental models of quantum optical resonance is the interaction of a single two - level atom with a single quantised mode of radiation , described by the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite . despite being simple enough to be analytically soluble in the rotating - wave approximation",
    ", this model has been a long - lasting source of insight into the nuances of the interaction between light and matter .",
    "it has led to nontrivial predictions , such as the existence of ` collapses ' and ` revivals ' in the atomic excitation @xcite , and has also allowed a deeper understanding of the dynamical entangling and disentangling of the atom - field system in the course of time @xcite .",
    "further interest in the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) comes from the fact that these predictions are directly accessible to experimental verification . a jcm interaction can be experimentally realized in cavity - qed setups @xcite and also , as an effective interaction , in laser - cooled trapped ions @xcite ( in which case the ionic harmonic motion assumes the role normally played by the field mode ) .",
    "for example , revivals in the atomic excitation have recently been observed in a cavity - qed experiment @xcite , providing direct evidence for the discreteness of photons .    in spite of these successes , a closed analytical description of the collapse - revival pattern",
    "has so far proved to be elusive ; however , an elegant approximation scheme valid for a number of initial conditions has been presented by fleischhauer and schleich @xcite , improving the earlier work of eberly and co - workers @xcite . among other things , they have demonstrated that , when the atom is initially completely excited or de - excited , and the initial photon - number distribution of the field ( @xmath0 ) is sufficiently smooth ( as is the case in a coherent state ) then the shape of each revival is a direct reflection of the shape of @xmath0 .",
    "this direct relationship can be affected by the presence of initial atomic coherence .",
    "it has been noticed @xcite that if the atom is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of its energy eigenstates , then the revivals can be largely suppressed , effectively freezing the value of the atomic state populations .",
    "appropriately , these initial atomic states have been referred to as `` atomic trapping states '' @xcite_. _ this population trapping has been connected to the existence of a specific phase difference between the relative phase of the atomic superposition and the phase of the initial field state @xcite . in particular , in the resonant case exact trapping has been shown to exist @xcite if the field is initially prepared in a phase coherent state @xcite ( eigenstate of the susskind - glogower phase operator @xcite ) .",
    "as has been pointed out by cirac and snchez - soto @xcite , this can be understood by the fact that in these cases only one state out of each pair of dressed eigenstates of the jcm is ever populated .",
    "we now note that , since the atomic excitation dynamics can be modified merely by altering the initial atomic state , then it is apparent that the initial photon distribution can not be the sole responsible for the existence and shape of revivals .",
    "in fact , as we demonstrate in this paper , the key to understand the collapse - revival pattern under more general initial conditions is to consider not only the initial coherence of the atom and field by themselves , but also their joint properties as a single quantum system .",
    "this is so even if the system is initially disentangled .",
    "building on cirac and snchez - soto s observation , we find that the revival structure depends _  _ essentially _  _ on the _ relative weight _ of each dressed eigenstate in the initial atom - field state .",
    "we _  _ are able to identify an atom - field variable which plays , in the general case , the same role as that of the photon distribution when the atom is initially excited or de - excited .",
    "this allows us to estimate for any initial condition the degree of suppression of the revivals ( that is , the amount of trapping which occurs ) .",
    "in addition , in some particular cases we are able to describe analytically to a good approximation the shape of the revivals , even when they are partially suppressed . to illustrate the dressed - state distribution dependence of the revival patterns ,",
    "we show that essentially identical examples can be found both in the presence of initial atomic coherence , and in cases where this coherence is not only atomic , but where atom and field are already entangled .",
    "our work is organised as follows : in section ii , we rewrite the dynamics of the jaynes - cummings model from a point of view based on the entangled dressed - state eigenbasis . with the help of an appropriate coordinate system , the expression for the atomic inversion assumes a simpler form ; as a consequence , we are able to calculate bounds for the evolution of this quantity for arbitrary initial conditions . in order to illustrate our technique , specific cases are treated in section iii . in section iv , we generalise fleischhauer and schleich s scheme to include the cases where trapping occurs .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section v.",
    "the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , on resonance and in the rotating - wave approximation is given by @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the atomic transition frequency , @xmath3 is the atom - field dipole coupling constant , @xmath4 is the field photon creation ( annihilation ) operator and @xmath5 are the atomic inversion , rising and lowering operators .",
    "the first two terms in this expression describe the internal energy levels of the spin-1/2-like 2-level atom and the harmonic oscillator - like field mode , and the interaction term can be straightforwardly understood as a one - excitation exchange between these two systems .",
    "_  _    an important feature of this fully - quantised matter - radiation interaction is that its steady states ( known as ` dressed states ' ) are _  _ _ entangled .",
    "_ switching to an interaction - picture representation for convenience , it can be shown that these states and their corresponding energy levels are @xcite :    @xmath6   \\label{dressedstates } \\\\ e_{n\\pm } & = & \\pm \\hbar \\lambda \\sqrt{n+1}\\equiv \\pm \\frac{\\hbar } { 2}% \\omega _ { n }   \\label{energies}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( @xmath7 is the rabi frequency ) .",
    "it is apparent that in all these cases the atomic state is completely undetermined , being an equal mixture of the excited and ground states .",
    "thus , if we assume that at @xmath8 the atom and field are independently prepared in the states    @xmath9    then the initial state @xmath10 will evolve into @xmath11 \\left| e , n\\right\\rangle +   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } \\left [   \\begin{array}{c } qc_{n+1}\\cos \\left ( \\lambda t\\sqrt{n+1}\\right ) - \\\\   -ipc_{n}\\sin \\left ( \\lambda t\\sqrt{n+1}\\right ) \\end{array } \\right ] \\left| g , n+1\\right\\rangle   \\label{interevol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    despite being straightforwardly solvable in this way , the jcm is well - known for the fact that the time - evolution of most expectation values is usually expressible only in series form .",
    "for instance , assume that at time @xmath8 we have : @xmath12 the time evolution of the atomic population inversion is then given by :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 in particular , if at @xmath8 the atom is completely excited @xmath15 or in the ground state @xmath16 , and admitting for simplicity that @xmath17 is negligible , then this expression reduces to the simpler form @xmath18 where @xmath19is the initial photon distribution of the field .",
    "due to the @xmath20 scaling of the various rabi frequencies in this sum , no closed form for it is known .",
    "nevertheless , it is apparent that features of this time evolution , such as collapse - revival phenomena , must be directly related to the characteristics of @xmath0 .",
    "the fleischhauer - schleich approximation scheme , which we shall discuss in section iv , allows this relationship to be explicitly described in certain situations , such as when @xmath0 is sufficiently smooth .",
    "apart from the simple case represented above , in general there is no way to relate the inversion dynamics exclusively to the initial field state .",
    "as can be seen from expression ( [ complinver ] ) , it will usually depend on atomic and field variables in an apparently complicated way . in the next section ,",
    "we show how this evolution can be recast in a simple form , reminiscent of expression ( [ invfactcase ] ) , independently of the initial conditions .",
    "our discussion will be based on the relative contribution of each dressed state for the global atom - field state . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to _ pure _ initial conditions .",
    "therefore , we may expand an arbitrary initial state in terms of @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 ,   \\label{dresscomp}\\ ] ] with the normalisation condition @xmath24 the parameters @xmath25 , $ ] @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 , $ ] will henceforth be referred to as _ dressed - state coordinates_.    the use of this coordinate system allows us to obtain a simple geometrical picture of the manifold of pure atom - field states .",
    "for each value of @xmath28 one can imagine a bloch - type spherical shell corresponding to the two - level system formed by @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , which are parametrised by the spherical coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 the poles @xmath32 are associated to the dressed states @xmath29 , and points on the equator @xmath33 to the states of the form @xmath34 $ ] , which include the particular product states @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( corresponding to @xmath37 ) .",
    "therefore the coordinate @xmath30 gives a measure of what we shall call the ` _ dressedness _ ' ( or degree of proximity to the nearest dressed state ) of the components @xmath38 of @xmath39 .",
    "we note that , while this property is related to the _ entanglement _ of @xmath38 ( since the dressed states are in fact maximally entangled ) , they are two different concepts : states with the same dressedness , such as @xmath40 and @xmath41 can have different amounts of entanglement ( as measured by the von neumann entropy of their subsystems ) .",
    "meanwhile , the weight factors @xmath42 measure the relative importance of each of these components . in physical terms , their squares @xmath43 correspond to the probability distribution for measurements of the _ total excitation number _ operator _  _ @xmath44 _  _ on the initial state @xmath45 ( @xmath43 corresponds to the probability for @xmath46 excitations ) .",
    "we note that , in the special case where the atom is prepared in one of the states @xmath47 or @xmath48 , then @xmath49 and @xmath50 for all @xmath51 , while @xmath52 reduces to the photon number distribution : @xmath53    we now show that the dressed - state coordinate system allows a simple description of the time evolution of any initial state . from equations",
    "( [ dressedstates],b ) , the evolution of state ( [ inista ] ) is given by    @xmath54 .\\ ] ]    we can re - express this directly in terms of the dressed - state coordinates :    @xmath55    thus , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are both constants of motion , while the angles @xmath58 and @xmath59 precess with a constant angular velocity proportional to the rabi frequency @xmath7 .",
    "a way of visualising this is by means of a geometrical image as in fig .",
    "the simplicity of this picture reflects the symmetries of the resonant jcm : the conservation of @xmath60 and the fact that , in the interaction picture , the energies in each 2-dimensional eigensubspace generated by @xmath29 are always symmetric with respect to zero .",
    "let us now apply this coordinate system to describe the evolution of atomic variables .",
    "_  _ in the basis @xmath61 the reduced atomic density operator can be expressed as : @xmath62   \\label{atomdm}\\ ] ] where    @xmath63    we thus see that the evolution of the atomic level populations , and therefore of the population inversion , can be expressed in a simple form for any initial condition :    @xmath64    this should be contrasted with the much more complicated expression ( [ complinver ] ) for this same quantity , written in terms of separate atomic and field coordinates .",
    "in fact , we can see that the present expression is a direct generalisation of eq .",
    "( [ invfactcase ] ) , obtained by phase - shifting the @xmath65 term in the sum by @xmath66 and by replacing the photon number distribution @xmath67 with @xmath68 it is not difficult to understand the reason for this substitution .",
    "first of all , as was noted by cirac and snchez - soto @xcite , dressed states have no population inversion .",
    "therefore , if a component @xmath69 of a given state @xmath70 has a large ` dressedness ' ( @xmath71 ) , it will contribute very little to the overall inversion@xmath72 moreover , even if @xmath38 does have a large inversion , this may still be of little consequence to the total average @xmath73 if its relative importance @xmath52 is small . thus , the product @xmath74 which we shall refer to as the ` weighted dressedness distribution ' gives the appropriate magnitude of the contribution of @xmath38 to the inversion . in other words , for general initial conditions it is this distribution , not @xmath67 , that will control the evolution of the inversion .",
    "for instance , we can expect the existence of collapse - revival structures if @xmath75 is ` narrow ' , in the sense that few values of @xmath51 ( and therefore few rabi frequencies @xmath76 feature significantly in the sum .",
    "the main difference between the general evolutions allowed by equation ( [ popinv ] ) and those obtained in the special case ( [ invfactcase ] ) lies in the fact that the distribution @xmath0 is normalised _ , _ while @xmath77 is generally _",
    "not_. this implies that , in general , there will be an upper bound for the allowed range of variation of the population inversion , given by :    @xmath78    as we can see , this bound is specified essentially by the _",
    "average dressedness _ of the components of @xmath79 .",
    "for example : if the most important components ( those with largest weights @xmath80 ) are highly dressed ( @xmath81 is small ) , then the amplitude of variation of the population inversion will also be small ( @xmath82 ) . _  _ in other words , these are the conditions for the existence of _ population trapping _ in the ( resonant ) jcm_. _ the steady - state value of the inversion is given simply by @xmath83 , i.e. , by the fixed population in the ground state .",
    "we emphasise that , given any initial condition , the bound @xmath84 can be immediately calculated from the constants of the motion @xmath85 @xmath57 , thus giving an estimate of the amount of trapping that can be expected from that state s evolution @xcite .",
    "in order to illustrate our technique , we analyse three classes of initial atom - field states for which population trapping occurs :      in @xcite , cirac and snchez - soto found a class of factorised initial conditions which exhibit _ perfect _ trapping , that is , for which the atomic populations are strictly constant over time .",
    "these were of the form :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 in this case , the field is prepared in an eigenstate of the susskind - glogower phase operator @xmath88 @xcite ( ` phase - coherent state'@xcite ) , while the atomic superposition is chosen so that the phase of the atomic dipole matches that of the eigenvalue @xmath89 of the field state @xcite .",
    "the resulting population trapping can thus be attributed to a suitable matching of atomic and field parameters . however , as was later noticed by the same authors @xcite , a clearer explanation can be found by using a dressed - state point of view : rewriting this state in terms of the dressed - state basis , we find    @xmath90 .",
    "\\label{exact2}\\ ] ]    the reason for the existence of trapping now becomes immediately clear : all the components @xmath38 of this state are completely dressed ( @xmath91 ) , and thus do not contribute to the inversion .",
    "cirac and snchez - soto also stated @xcite that these are the _ only _ factorised states exhibiting perfect trapping .",
    "we note that this is not strictly true : the same result is still achieved for all states of the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 can be @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( in this case , the field state is not in general an eigenstate of @xmath96 ) . once again , this can be seen by rewriting the state in the dressed - state basis . in this case , we obtain @xmath97\\ ] ] where for each @xmath51 there is a single dressed state @xmath98 present , whose sign is the same as that of the ratio @xmath99 the converse statement is also easy to show : suppose @xmath45 is a perfect trapping state , of the form :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is a constant and @xmath102 @xmath89 are arbitrary .",
    "then for each @xmath103 component of this state to be perfectly dressed it is necessary that : @xmath104 and hence @xmath105 we recover expression ( [ exact3 ] ) by noting that @xmath106 must be less than @xmath107 for @xmath45 to be normalisable .",
    "thus , for the resonant jcm  there can be no population trapping with positive population inversion .      while the initial conditions considered above lead to perfect trapping , preparing the appropriate field states requires elaborate state - engineering techniques .",
    "it has been shown ( numerically ) by zaheer and zubairy , however , that _ approximate _ population trapping is also possible if the cavity field is initially in a coherent state @xmath108 , which are easily accessible in experiment @xcite .",
    "this is portrayed in fig .",
    "2 : if the atom is initially completely excited , the inversion evolves according to the familiar collapse - revival pattern @xcite ; however , by suitably rotating the atomic state , the revival peaks become more and more reduced , practically disappearing when the atom is prepared in state @xmath109 ( where @xmath110 is the phase of the field s coherent amplitude @xmath111 ) .",
    "close inspection also reveals that , in this limit , the revival peaks become split into doublets .    in their work , zaheer and zubairy gave no quantitative explanation for this quenching of the revivals , attributing it qualitatively to a `` destructive interference between the atomic dipole and the cavity eigenmode '' .",
    "later , cirac and snchez - soto pointed out that the existence of approximate trapping in this case _  _ should be expected due to similarities between the properties of coherent states and of the phase coherent field states @xcite .    with the help of our dressed - state coordinate system",
    ", we can now give a quantitative description of this effect .",
    "let us suppose that the atom - field system is prepared in the state :    @xmath112 \\otimes \\left| \\alpha \\right\\rangle ,   \\label{zzstate}\\ ] ]    where the atom is in a coherent superposition of ground and excited states and the field is in a coherent state @xmath113 . expanding this state in terms of the dressed - state basis",
    ", we find that its dressed - state coordinates have the following values ( we have only listed those relevant for the atomic inversion ) :    @xmath114 \\text { } % , n\\geq -1   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the weight factors @xmath80 follow a poisson distribution when @xmath115 is equal to zero ( they reduce to the photon number distribution of the coherent field ) and have small deviations from that distribution for any value of @xmath115 . for moderately",
    "large @xmath116 , therefore , @xmath80 is maximised around the integer @xmath117 closest to @xmath118 or @xmath119 meanwhile , it is not difficult to show that the @xmath120 distribution has an absolute minimum , located around @xmath121 @xmath122 with minimum value given by @xmath123 this indicates the component of @xmath124 having the largest dressedness .",
    "following the procedure outlined in section [ trap ] , we can now see that to attain the highest possible degree of population trapping we must maximise the largest dressedness , and match it with the largest weight factor :    @xmath125    we thus explain the `` atomic trapping state '' ( [ zz ] ) found by zaheer and zubairy : it is the one for which the total atom - field state @xmath126 most closely resembles a `` perfect trapping state '' , in the sense that its most important components @xmath127 closely resemble dressed states .",
    "it is clear from expression ( [ zzdc ] ) that the degree of trapping experienced from initial state @xmath128 depends both on the relative weight @xmath115 of each atomic state and on the phase difference @xmath129 between the atomic dipole phase and the field s coherent amplitude . in fig .",
    "3 we illustrate the change in the weighted dressedness distribution @xmath130 as a function of these parameters : on the left - hand side , we take equal weights for @xmath131 and @xmath48 , satisfying condition ( [ cond1 ] ) , and vary @xmath132 from @xmath133 to @xmath134 .",
    "we can see the quenching of the distribution as the dressedness of the component @xmath135 is increased . on the right - hand side ,",
    "we keep the phase difference null and vary the relative weight from @xmath134 to @xmath136 , obtaining a similar effect ( in both cases , we have chosen @xmath137 ) . comparing this figure with fig .",
    "2 , it is apparent that there is a striking similarity between the profile of the @xmath130 distribution and the envelope of the revivals in the corresponding time evolution , including the appearance of a doublet structure in the limit of the optimal trapping conditions . as we shall see in section iv ,",
    "this is no coincidence .",
    "the achievement of population trapping in the previous examples was seen to be ultimately caused by the quenching of the @xmath77 distribution , and therefore by the joint properties of the atom - field system . however , since the initial states considered were factorised into atomic and field states , it could also be argued that the trapping was due to a suitable matching of independent atomic and field parameters ( i.e. , the phase of the field s coherent amplitude matching the atomic dipole phase in the previous example ) . in order to stress the underlying importance of the dressed - state point of view ,",
    "we now show that essentially identical evolution and trapping patterns for the population inversion can be obtained even when the atom and field can not be considered as independent quantum systems .",
    "consider the following class of states of the atom - field system :    @xmath138    where @xmath139  @xmath140 and @xmath141 are respectively even and odd coherent states of the cavity field ( here @xmath116 is assumed large enough so that these states can be considered normalised ) .",
    "it can be seen that , apart from the limiting cases where @xmath142 , these states are _",
    "entangled_. furthermore , since @xmath143  @xmath144  have nonzero amplitudes only for even ( odd ) photon numbers , an expansion of this state in terms of dressed states @xmath29 features only those with _ even _",
    "@xmath51 ( in other words , @xmath145 ) .",
    "physically , this implies that states of this form have _ zero _ average electric and magnetic fields , and _",
    "zero _ average atomic polarisation .",
    "@xmath146 thus , if at t = 0 the atom - filed system is in state @xmath147 , the population inversion evolves according to eq .",
    "( [ popinv ] ) , but with only the even terms present : @xmath148    now , it turns out that all these even - indexed dressed - state coordinates have values virtually identical to the ones listed in expression ( [ zzdc ] ) above for the state @xmath149 with the same parameters @xmath150 the only difference is a multiplication of the weights @xmath151 in the present case by a factor of 2 , to preserve normalisation in spite of the absence of odd - indexed components .",
    "the resulting time - evolution of the atomic inversion , plotted in fig .",
    "4 , shows that the quenching of revivals and appearance of a doublet structure as @xmath152 proceed in essentially the same manner as in the previous case , the main difference being the doubling of the frequency of revivals @xcite .",
    "_  _ we note , however , that in the present case neither of the parameters @xmath153 _  _ can be unambiguously assigned exclusively to the atom or field , so that population trapping in this case must necessarily be understood as a result of the joint atom - field properties of the state in question .",
    "it is also worth remarking that , due to the lack of atomic polarisation , the atomic reduced density operators of these states are always diagonal in the @xmath154 basis .",
    "therefore , the _ reduced entropy _ @xmath155 , which measures the degree of entanglement between the atom and the field , is entirely determined by the population inversion : @xmath156 thus , in this case the existence of population trapping is equivalent to the atom and field remaining ( nearly ) maximally entangled during their entire time - evolution . for any given state @xmath157 a lower bound to the value of @xmath158 at any given instant of the evolution is then given by : @xmath159 where @xmath84 is the bound defined in eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) .",
    "for instance , in the case of the ` trapping state ' depicted in fig .",
    "4 , where , @xmath160 , @xmath161 @xmath162 , we have @xmath163 , very close to the maximum possible value @xmath164 finally , we note that despite the existence of this lower bound , it is still possible to devise schemes by which such entangled atom - field states can be constructed @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , fleischhauer and schleich obtained approximate analytical expressions for the evolution of the atomic inversion , using a stationary - phase method based on the _ poisson summation formula _",
    "they showed that in many cases the inversion can be written as a sum in which each term @xmath165 is non - negligible only during a certain extension of time .",
    "this is in contrast for instance with the expressions used in section [ modelsec ] above , where each term in the summation is periodic .",
    "their work was restricted to initial states of the form @xmath166 , in which the inversion is given by eq .",
    "( [ invfactcase ] ) .",
    "they were able to show that , if the photon distribution @xmath0 of @xmath167 is sufficiently smooth , then the @xmath168 term in the poisson sum for the inversion is given by    @xmath169    where @xmath170 is a continuous interpolation of @xmath0 .",
    "the main interest of this formulation is the fact that , if @xmath67 is also sufficiently narrow , then the term @xmath165 describes to a high accuracy the evolution of the inversion during the @xmath168 revival .",
    "this can be readily seen from the formula above : this term describes a rapid oscillation in time , modulated by an envelope centred around @xmath171 and whose format is essentially that of @xmath172 therefore , for narrow enough @xmath67 , some of the terms @xmath165 become completely disjoint from the rest , describing an independent revival .",
    "fleischhauer and schleich were able to use this formulation to derive many interesting results , such as the decrease in amplitude and increase in width of each successive revival , and also the number of revivals that can be resolved for a given state , before they become scrambled due to their increasing width and consequent interference with each other .",
    "finally , they were also able to extend the technique to some cases where @xmath67 is not smooth , such as in squeezed states .    using our dressed - state formulation for the population inversion , eq .",
    "( [ popinv ] ) , we are able to extend the poisson summation formula method to even more general initial states , including ones with atomic or atom - field coherence . in the appendix we show that , under suitable conditions , the behaviour of the atomic inversion during its @xmath168 revival is described by : @xmath173 \\right| _ { n+1=\\frac{\\lambda ^2t^2}{4\\pi ^2k^2 } } \\label{kthrevival}\\ ] ] where @xmath174 is a continuous interpolation of the ` weighted dressedness ' distribution @xmath130 of the initial state .",
    "thus , in general it is this distribution , not @xmath67 , that is reflected in the shape of each revival . in particular , in the case of population trapping , the quenching of the revivals mirrors that of @xmath130 .",
    "this explains the similarity between the profiles in figs . 2 and 3 , including the doublet structure of the revivals in the limit of maximum trapping .",
    "in order to display the accurateness of this expression , we use it to calculate the revivals in the case of the zaheer - zubairy states @xmath126 introduced above . from expressions ( [ zzdc ] ) for the dressed coordinates , we see that in this case the weighted dressedness distribution is given by @xmath175 where    @xmath176    for sufficiently large @xmath177 , these poissonian distributions are well approximated by gaussians :    @xmath178    extending these to continuous values of @xmath51 and substituting in ( [ ddist ] ) ( [ kthrevival ] ) we obtain an analytical expression for the @xmath168 revival in the inversion . in fig .",
