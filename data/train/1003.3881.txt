    "many nonperturbative techniques have been invented to study the properties of quantum field theory . in this paper",
    "we reconsider a little - known nonperturbative technique that was invented in 1992 by bender , boettcher , and lipatov @xcite and we use this technique to examine the ground - state energy of a massless scalar quantum field theory having a self - interaction of the form @xmath6 . while the hamiltonian for this quantum field theory is complex and obviously not dirac hermitian , the hamiltonian is @xmath3-symmetric . the nonperturbative technique developed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provides support for the conjecture that the ground - state energy for this strange looking quantum field theory is real .",
    "the nonperturbative technique used in this paper is called _ dimensional expansion _ and the general idea is to expand the green s functions of a quantum field theory as taylor series in powers of the space - time dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the leading term in such an expansion is easy to determine because it requires only that one solve the corresponding zero - dimensional version of the quantum field theory ; clearly , this is a trivial exercise .",
    "the surprising discovery that was reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite is that the _ first - order _ term ( the coefficient of @xmath0 ) in the dimensional expansion can also be calculated exactly and in closed form .",
    "furthermore , graphical techniques were devised that can be used to obtain approximately the higher - order terms in the dimensional expansion .    in the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics the hamiltonian @xmath7",
    "is assumed to be _ dirac hermitian _ ,",
    "where by this term we mean that @xmath8 and the symbol @xmath9 represents combined matrix transposition and complex conjugation .",
    "the condition of dirac hermiticity allows the matrix elements of @xmath7 to be complex , but it guarantees that the eigenvalues of @xmath7 are real .",
    "however , in 1998 it was shown that it is possible to extend a hermitian hamiltonian into the complex domain while keeping the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian real , even though the hamiltonian is no longer dirac hermitian @xcite .",
    "these papers showed how to extend the harmonic oscillator into the complex domain and thereby obtain the following infinite family of complex non - hermitian hamiltonians having real eigenvalues : @xmath10 in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite it was argued that the reality of the spectra of @xmath7 in ( [ e1 ] ) was due to the unbroken @xmath3 symmetry of these hamiltonians for @xmath5 . by _ unbroken _",
    "@xmath3 symmetry , we mean that the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian are also eigenfunctions of the @xmath3 operator .",
    "the eigenvalues of this class of hamiltonians are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "thus , in quantum mechanics the class of physically allowed hamiltonians can be enlarged to include non - dirac - hermitian but @xmath3-symmetric hamiltonians in addition to dirac - hermitian hamiltonians , and eigenfunctions ( solutions to the schrdinger equation ) are treated as functions of complex coordinates @xcite .",
    "experimental observations of physical systems described by complex @xmath3-symmetric hamiltonians are now being reported @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath3-symmetric hamiltonians can define a conventional theory of quantum mechanics suggests that it is also possible to extend quantum field theories into the complex domain @xcite .",
    "the quantum - field - theoretic analogs of the quantum theories described by the hamiltonians in ( [ e1 ] ) are the massless complex scalar quantum field theories whose euclidean lagrangians have the form @xmath11 it has not been proved rigorously that the energies of such quantum field theories are real but approximate solutions to the dyson - schwinger equations indicate that the poles of the green s functions are real @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized very simply . in sec .  [ s2 ] we review the dimensional - expansion techniques that were introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite and show how to apply them to the field theories whose euclidean lagrangians are given in ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ s3 ] we make some concluding remarks and suggest future directions for research .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we derive a formula for the dimensional expansion of the _ logarithmic derivative _",
    "@xmath12 of the free - energy density @xmath13 for the lagrangian @xmath14 in ( [ e2 ] ) : @xmath15 note that @xmath12 , as defined in ( [ e3 ] ) , is a dimensionless number for all @xmath0 and is independent of the coupling constant @xmath16 ; @xmath12 is a function only of the dimensionless numbers @xmath17 and @xmath0 .",
    "we seek a dimensional expansion of @xmath12 in the form of a taylor series in powers of @xmath0 : @xmath18      calculating the first term in the dimensional expansion ( [ e4 ] ) is easy because it is obtained from the zero - dimensional version of the field theory : @xmath19\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & ( 2+\\epsilon)g\\frac{\\int_c dx\\,gx^2(ix)^\\epsilon\\exp\\left[-gx^2(ix)^\\epsilon \\right]}{\\int_c dx\\,\\exp\\left[-gx^2(ix)^\\epsilon\\right]}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1 .",
    "\\label{e5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the first term in the dimensional expansion ( [ e4 ] ) is simply unity .",
    "it is important to point out that the contour @xmath20 for the integrals in ( [ e5 ] ) terminates in two stokes wedges in the complex-@xmath21 plane .",
    "as @xmath17 increases from 0 , these stokes wedges ( inside of which the integral converges ) rotate downward and become thinner . at @xmath22",
    "the stokes wedges are centered about the positive - real and negative - real axes and they have angular opening @xmath23 . when @xmath24 , the stokes wedges are centered about the two angles @xmath25 thus , the two stokes wedges are symmetric about the imaginary-@xmath21 axis .",
    "the opening angles of the stokes wedges are @xmath26 .",
    "thus , at @xmath27 ( an @xmath28 theory ) the stokes wedges are adjacent to and below the real axes and have angular opening @xmath29 . when @xmath30 , these wedges lie below and do not contain the real axis .",
    "this smooth movement of the stokes wedges indicates that the field theories defined by the lagrangians in ( [ e2 ] ) can be viewed as being smooth extensions in the parameter @xmath17 of the dirac - hermitian ( harmonic - oscillator ) hamiltonian , which lies at @xmath22 , into the complex non - dirac - hermitian domain for which @xmath24 .",
    "next , we show how to calculate the coefficient of @xmath0 in the dimensional expansion ( [ e4 ] ) . to begin , we add and subtract a mass term in the euclidean lagrangian ( [ e2 ] ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a mass parameter .",
    "the weak - coupling expansion for the green s functions of this lagrangian is in principle determined by a formal set of feynman rules : @xmath33 here , the coupling constant @xmath16 has dimensions of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we choose the mass parameter in ( [ e7 ] ) equal to the appropriate power of @xmath16 @xmath35 it is important to note that if @xmath17 is an integer , then there is a diagrammatic expansion defined by the rules in ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "however , it is not necessary that @xmath17 be an integer ; it can be any nonnegative real number .",
    "thus , unlike the case in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the amplitude @xmath36 does not technically represent a vertex but rather the continuation of a vertex amplitude off integer values of @xmath37 .",
    "the free - energy density @xmath13 for the lagrangian @xmath14 in ( [ e7 ] ) is given by the standard functional - integral representation @xmath38 where @xmath20 is the complex contour discussed above , the measure must be properly normalized , and @xmath39 represents the volume of space - time in @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "we can express the right side of ( [ e10 ] ) as the product of two factors : @xmath40\\times \\left[\\frac{\\int_c{{\\cal d}}\\phi\\,\\exp\\left(-\\int d^dx\\,l\\right ) } { \\int_c { { \\cal d}}\\phi\\,\\exp\\left(-\\int d^dx\\,l_0\\right)}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{e11}\\ ] ] note that @xmath41 is the free ( noninteracting ) part of @xmath14 in ( [ e7 ] ) : @xmath42    next we take the logarithm of ( [ e11 ] ) and express the free energy @xmath13 as the sum of two terms : @xmath43 where @xmath44 \\label{e14}\\ ] ] and @xmath45 .",
    "\\label{e15}\\ ] ] the functional - integral expression for @xmath46 is the free - energy density associated with the noninteracting lagrangian in ( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "the expression @xmath47 represents the negative sum of all connected vacuum graphs except for polygonal loop graphs contributing to the free - energy density of the field theory described by the lagrangian @xmath41 .",
    "this is because the integral in the denominator of the argument of the logarithm in ( [ e15 ] ) eliminates from @xmath47 precisely those one - loop diagrams that contribute to @xmath46 .",
    "we can in principle calculate these graphs using the feynman rules in ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "we now show how to calculate each of these two quantities .    for this calculation we must use the 2 vertex in the feynman rules in ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "it is possible to calculate the free - energy density @xmath46 exactly for all dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "the free - energy density @xmath46 is the negative of the total contribution of all connected vacuum graphs .",
    "since these graphs are constructed from a two - point vertex , the graphs are all polygons .",
    "an @xmath48-vertex polygon has symmetry number @xmath49 , vertex factor @xmath50 , and momentum integral @xmath51 hence , apart from an additive divergent zero - point energy contribution that is independent of @xmath32 , we have @xmath52    each of the integrals in the summation ( [ e17 ] ) is infrared divergent , but if we interchange the orders of summation and integration , we see that this divergence evaporates and we obtain a finite integral representation for @xmath46 : @xmath53 this integral converges for @xmath54 , but the integral is ultraviolet divergent at @xmath55",
    ".    we can evaluate the integral in ( [ e18 ] ) straightforwardly by introducing polar coordinates .",
    "the result is @xmath56 thus , taking a logarithmic derivative , we find that the contribution of @xmath46 to @xmath57 is _ exactly _ given by @xmath58 the taylor expansion in powers of @xmath0 of this quantity begins as follows : @xmath59d+{\\rm o}(d^2 ) , \\label{e21}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is euler s constant .",
    "these are the first two terms in the dimensional expansion for the logarithmic derivative of the free energy of the quantum field theory in ( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "the radius of convergence of this dimensional expansion is 2 .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite that while one might imagine that calculating @xmath47 is difficult because the computation requires the evaluation of the sum of all vacuum graphs , the calculation to order @xmath0 is very easy .",
    "the reason for this is that we only need to calculate the sum of the vacuum graphs for the case of zero dimensions if we want to know @xmath12 to order @xmath0 .",
    "this is true because the contribution of each vacuum graph is a finite quantity having dimensions of @xmath61 ( the dimensions of an energy density ) and each graph is finite in the limit as @xmath62 , unlike the expression for @xmath46 in ( [ e19 ] ) .",
    "thus , each vacuum graph has the general form @xmath63 .",
    "\\label{e22}\\ ] ] consequently , when we calculate the logarithmic derivative of each graph in @xmath47 to obtain @xmath12 , the factor of @xmath61 contributes a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "the vacuum graphs need only be calculated for the special case @xmath64 .",
    "to verify the form in ( [ e22 ] ) , we argue as follows : for every feynman graph we must evaluate a @xmath0-dimensional momentum integral as required by the feynman rules in ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "the integrand @xmath65 of this integral is a combination of propagators of the form @xmath66 . in the limit as @xmath62",
    ", we may replace @xmath65 by @xmath67 because there is no infrared divergence in any graph .",
    "in fact , the value of the integral as @xmath62 is just @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that we can express @xmath47 for small @xmath0 as a ratio of dimensionless integrals multiplied by the mass factor @xmath61 : @xmath68 } { \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dx\\,\\exp\\left(-{\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}x^2\\right)}. \\label{e23}\\ ] ] we evaluate the integral in the numerator of ( [ e23 ] ) by reducing it to a real integral along the centers of the stokes wedges .",
    "the result is that @xmath69 .",
    "\\label{e24}\\ ] ] this gives the order @xmath70 contribution from @xmath47 to @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we combine the contributions to @xmath12 from @xmath46 in ( [ e21 ] ) and from @xmath47 in ( [ e24 ] ) .",
    "the result is that the dimensional expansion has the form @xmath71d+{\\rm o}\\left(d^2\\right ) , \\label{e25}\\ ] ] and we emphasize that the coefficients of @xmath72 and @xmath73 in this expansion are exact .",
    "in this paper we have used the dimensional - expansion techniques proposed by bender , boettcher , and lipatov in 1992 to find exactly the first two terms of the dimensional expansion ( [ e25 ] ) for the ground - state energy density of the euclidean quantum field theory defined by the complex , non - dirac - hermitian lagrangian in ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "the reality of the coefficients in this expansion suggests that the entire expansion may well have real coefficients .",
    "we do not know how to calculate the higher coefficients in the dimensional expansion exactly .",

    "@xcite and @xcite that can be used to find accurate approximations to the higher coefficients .",
