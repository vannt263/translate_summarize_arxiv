    "we have to avoid such values of @xmath76 that @xmath77 determined by eq.([y ] ) also makes @xmath189 .",

    "<S> first , it has been shown in @xcite that all fully entangled symmetric pure 3-qubit states , especially those exceptional symmetric states that fail our test , pass another hardy - type test for genuine tripartite nonlocality . together with this result for symmetric cases , </S>",
    "<S> whose proof is included in appendix for completeness , our result for asymmetric cases implies that every fully entangled 3-qubit pure state passes a hardy - type test for genuine tripartite and therefore is genuine tripartite nonlocal . </S>",

    "<S> not all pure states , e.g. , all the maximally entangled states , can exhibit hardy - type nonlocality while all tripartite entangled pure states exhibit hardy - type nonlocality .    </S>",
    "<S> second , for an arbitrary tripartite entangled pure state with the underlying hilbert space having arbitrary dimensions , we have expansion @xmath84 in its magic basis with @xmath85 . if there exist @xmath86 such that @xmath87 then we make a local projection to the 3-qubit subspace spanned by @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath89 for all possible @xmath90 then , since @xmath41 is fully entangled , we can suppose @xmath91 and @xmath92 for some @xmath93 without lose of generosity . </S>",
    "<S> after locally projecting qudit 1 and 2 to the 2-qubit subspace spanned by @xmath94 we obtain @xmath95 and @xmath96 are two single - qudit states orthogonal to @xmath97 with nonzero norms . </S>",
    "<S> let a normalized @xmath98 if @xmath99 is proportional to @xmath100 and @xmath101 if otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> after a further local projection to the 2 dimensional subspace of the third qudit spanned by @xmath102 , the first three terms in eq.([p3 ] ) are left , since @xmath103 has non vanishing overlaps with both @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in either cases we obtain a fully entangled 3-qubit state in its magic basis ( may be different from the one defined by the closest product state ) by a local projection : in the first case we have @xmath60 while in the second case we have @xmath56 with at least two coefficients among @xmath104 being nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , according to the above discussion for 3-qubit pure states , we conclude that every tripartite entangled pure state passes a hardy - type test and therefore exhibits genuine tripartite nonlocality .    </S>",
    "<S> third , our 3-particle hardy - type test has a direct generalization to arbitrary number of particles . </S>",
    "<S> the original hardy s test for two particles @xcite contains conditions @xmath105 and @xmath106 for every @xmath107 or simply @xmath108 . our 3-particle hardy - type test can be written as @xmath109 and @xmath110 with @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that @xmath112 and @xmath113 are hardy - type test for @xmath114 particles , then @xmath115 and @xmath116 where @xmath117 give rise to a hardy - type test for @xmath118 particles which can be proved to be failed by all local non - signaling models ( see appendix ) .    as a final remark , </S>",
    "<S> the maximal surviving probability @xmath119 can be found analytically for arbitrary @xmath118 @xcite . in the case of three qubits </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath120 with @xmath121 being the unique positive root of @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this bound is device independent . for another example in the following 3-qubit state @xmath123 and @xmath124 , corresponding to the measurements of observables @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively , for all three qubits then all conditions in eq.([ht ] ) are satisfied with a near - optimal survival probability @xmath127 .    to conclude , with the help of a hardy - type argument we have proved that tripartite entangled pure states do not admit a non - signaling local model and thus exhibit genuine tripartite nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , in order to reproduce the correlations in a tripartite entangled pure state by a hybrid local / nonlocal model , at least one observer must have access to signaling correlations with others . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have established a strong equivalence between genuine multipartite entanglement and nonlocality for tripartite pure states . </S>",
    "<S> it is highly possible to generalize this equivalence to more than 3 particles . in view of existing experimental implementations of hardy s two - particle test @xcite , </S>",
