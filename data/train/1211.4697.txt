    "numerical simulations of dynamos in geometries appropriate for the cores of terrestrial planets have greatly enhanced our understanding of the complex magnetic field behavior observed in these objects , with possible implications for a broader class of dynamos in astrophysical objects  @xcite .",
    "one of the major drawbacks of such simulations is that there is order of magnitude disagreement between the natural and the numerically accessible values of several control parameters .",
    "for instance , in numerical simulations of the geodynamo , the ekman number  a nondimensional measure of the importance of viscous effects as compared to the coriolis effects  is usually five to ten orders of magnitude larger than the expected realistic values .",
    "one way to tackle this disparity is to infer asymptotic scaling laws from a sufficient number of numerical results .",
    "such numerical scaling laws can then be extrapolated to realistic parameter regimes and compared with the observational data .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter  ca6 \" ) used a battery of numerical simulation results to derive scaling relations for heat transfer , convective velocity , and magnetic field strength .",
    "their scaling relations hold over several orders of magnitude of the relevant control parameter . using these scaling relations , ca6 predicted magnetic field strengths inside the earth s and jupiter s core and found reasonable agreement with observationally constrained values .",
    "later , @xcite showed that these scaling laws are also in good agreement with magnetic fields observed in fast rotating low - mass stars . @xcite and @xcite independently reinforced the scaling laws put forth by ca6 .",
    "@xcite derived scaling laws specifically for the dipole moment of planetary dynamos which show an order - of - magnitude agreement with the observed dipole moments of solar system planets .",
    "@xcite reviews earlier scaling laws for planetary magnetic field based on heuristic arguments and compares them with the numerically established scaling relations",
    ".    the mechanical boundary conditions may play an important role in the dynamo mechanism .",
    "dynamos which operate in planets with a solid mantle are usually modeled with rigid boundaries  @xcite . while a true free surface is difficult to model , a free - slip condition ( i.e. assuming zero shear stress at an undeformable spherical boundary ) is a much better approximation than a no - slip condition for the surface of gas- and ice - giant planets or stellar convection zones .",
    "rigid boundaries are associated with viscous ( ekman ) boundary layers , which have a damping influence on the development of strong axisymmetric flows that are found in free surface flows .",
    "@xcite argued that even for the geodynamo a free - slip condition may be a better choice , because the ekman layers in the models are much thicker than the very thin layers in the earth s core .",
    "@xcite demonstrated in rotating liquid gallium experiments that at small prandtl numbers  the ratio of kinematic viscosity to thermal diffusivity  flows with rigid boundaries show features similar to those with free - slip boundaries , i.e. dominant zonal flows .",
    "@xcite also found strong zonal flows in low ekman number ( @xmath0 ) rigid boundary geodynamo simulations .",
    "hence , studies of dynamos with free - slip boundaries have wide ranging applications . following these arguments",

    "recently , @xcite found evidence of bistability in m dwarfs .",
    "grote and co - workers @xcite have employed free - slip boundaries in their dynamo models , and found a wider spectrum of magnetic field geometries than what has been reported for rigid boundaries .    a direct comparison of the effects of different mechanical boundary conditions on the dynamo has rarely been made .",
    "@xcite reported results for both kinds of boundary conditions for a limited number of cases and found that the large scale magnetic field is similar for both cases .",

    "for example , we only found multipolar solutions for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this demonstrates that , depending on the control parameters , only the multipolar dynamo branch can be stable in some situations .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier results @xcite which showed that bistability is in fact a function of @xmath31 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "they used volumetric heating while we use a fixed temperature contrast to drive convection .",
    "the bistable behavior we observed generalizes their findings .",
    "one of the characteristic features of rotating spherical shell convection with free - slip boundaries is the development of strong axisymmetric zonal flows . in rigid boundary systems ,",
    "the reynolds stresses , which arise due to a statistical correlation between the radial and azimuthal flow component ( in cylindrical co - ordinates ) , are balanced by the bulk viscosity and the ekman layer friction near the outer boundary . in the case of free - slip boundaries ,",
    "the ekman layers are absent and zonal flows can thus saturate at much higher vigor . in dynamo models ,",
    "maxwell stresses also affect the zonal flows ; these stresses are potentially higher in dipolar dynamos that have higher magnetic field strength than multipolar ones at the same control parameter values  @xcite .",
    "one argument for the essential role of zonal flows for bistability is that an initial dipolar magnetic field inhibits the growth of zonal flows via maxwell stresses . in the case of a multipolar initial condition",
    ", strong zonal flows can develop , which in turn suppress the development of dipolar magnetic fields .",
    "this mechanism allows multipolar magnetic fields even for @xmath40 smaller than 0.1 .    the zonal flow structure of a bistable state is shown in fig .  [ fig : zonal_flow ] .",
    "it portrays a weak thermal wind driven zonal flow in the dipolar case and a nearly three times stronger and more geostrophic zonal flow in the multipolar case .",

    "all these scaling relations are very close to each other , which suggests that magnetic field , mechanical boundary conditions or density stratification have no substantial effect on the scaling behavior of heat transport in rotating spherical shell convection .",
    "however , we note that for larger values of the rossby number than the ones considered here , in a regime where inertia dominates over the coriolis force , the power - law scaling between @xmath49 and @xmath77 breaks down @xcite .          in fig .",

    "coupled with our earlier observation that @xmath49 scaling is effectively same in hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic convection in spherical shells , we can conjecture that the scaling of the flow component which is responsible for heat transfer is unaffected by the presence of magnetic field .    unlike the non - zonal rossby number , the zonal rossby number of dipolar dynamos is consistently lower than that of corresponding multipolar dynamos ( fig .",

    "note that as compared to the dipolar branch the scatter in the multipolar branch of fig .",
    "[ fig : zonal_and - non - zonal_ro]b is large .",
    "this could be due to the fact that unlike the dipolar branch the multipolar branch is a blend of dynamos which have quadrupolar , octupolar , and sometimes even higher order modes as the most dominating magnetic mode .",
    "since the maxwell stresses are dependent on the magnetic field geometry , the zonal flows saturate at many different levels . the hydrodynamic zonal flow is consistently higher than both dipolar and multipolar cases . for dipolar dynamos with rigid boundaries",
    ", @xcite argued that lorentz forces are essential to saturate the zonal flow and bring it into a thermal wind balance , rather than the boundary friction . in purely hydrodynamic cases with free - slip boundaries , it must be viscous friction in the bulk volume that limits the amplitude of the zonal flow . even for our multipolar dynamos , the zonal flow amplitude is smaller than in the hydrodynamic cases ( fig .

    "@xcite have discussed a more complex scaling for @xmath89 and report a marginal improvement in the quality of the fit .",
    "although the inset figure shows a small decrease in @xmath91 for bistable states when the magnetic field is multipolar , the scalings for dipolar and multipolar dynamos appear to follow the same trend .",
    "moreover , if we plot @xmath91 versus @xmath85 or @xmath84 ( not shown ) , then the scatter is increased as compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : tmag_ro_combo ] .",
