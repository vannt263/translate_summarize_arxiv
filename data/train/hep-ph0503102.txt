    "the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes induced by @xmath12 transitions have played a major role in probing proposals of new physics at the electroweak scale . while the study of @xmath13 keeps being the highlight in such investigations , more recently the relevance of @xmath12 induced purely hadronic decays",
    "has been emphasized , in particular in relation with the issue of testing cp violation in @xmath14 physics . among such decays ,",
    "the process @xmath1 has aroused much interest @xcite at least for two reasons : i ) the process can occur only at the loop level in the standard model ( sm ) , hence making it particularly suitable to spot sizeable contributions coming from new physics ; ii ) in the sm the cp asymmetry in such decay arises only from the indirect cp violation of the @xmath14 mixing , hence one can safely state that within the sm the golden mode @xmath15 and the decay @xmath1 yield the same amount of cp asymmetry , namely @xmath16 ; if the new physics entails the presence of direct cp asymmetry in the decay amplitude of @xmath1 , this can be revealed by a departure from the equality between the two mentioned cp asymmetries @xcite .",
    "indeed , the first data on the cp asymmetry in @xmath1 in 2002 @xcite gave rise to a wave of interest on this potentially very interesting signature of new physics which still continues today @xcite .    indeed ,",
    "even though the discrepancy of the data with respect to the sm predictions has been constantly decreasing in the two years elapsed from the first results in 2002 , still the current world averages of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xcite @xmath19 namely @xmath8 is about 2 @xmath20 lower than the sm prediction @xmath21 .",
    "notice that even if one does not wish to speculate much on the single above discrepancy , it is interesting to note that the data concerning @xmath22 processes with @xmath23 exhibit an overall discrepancy in the values of the cp asymmetry with respect to the sm predictions ( indeed , the cp asymmetries in @xmath24 and @xmath25 turn out to be smaller than that in @xmath15 which is measured from the tree level process @xmath26 ) .",
    "this discrepancy might be a signal for physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "assuming that the current low value of @xmath8 is a signal of new physics , we need a new cp violating phase in @xmath11 transition . an attractive possibility for such new physics beyond the sm occurs in supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy gut s ) scenarios with seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "in such scenarios , the large atmospheric neutrino oscillation can be related with a large @xmath11 transition through down type squark and gluino loop effects .",
    "this flavor changing effect is parameterized by a mixing parameter @xmath27 with a cp phase @xmath28 .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite for the definitions of the mass insertion parameters @xmath29 s .",
    "let us note that the following relations @xmath30 will be useful , when we relate @xmath31 and @xmath32 in this work . for low @xmath33 , the single @xmath0 insertion can lead to some deviation in @xmath8 , if gluinos and squarks are relatively light . for large @xmath33 case , the double mass insertion can lead to an effective @xmath34 insertion of @xmath35 , leading to a significant deviation in @xmath8 from the sm prediction . in fig .  1 ( a ) , we show the feynman diagram for @xmath36 involving a cp violating @xmath27 .",
    "the new cp violating phase in the @xmath0 insertion can affect the strange quark chromo - electric dipole moment ( cedm ) through triple mass insertions , if there is an @xmath37 insertion between third and second generation down squarks .",
    "[ fig .  1 ( b ) ] @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath37 insertion is generically present in the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) case , the strange quark cedm puts a strong constraint on the possible deviation of @xmath8 from the sm prediction .",
    "however , the substantial theoretical uncertainties occurring when one relates the quark cedm s with the hadronic edm s suggest that it would be preferable to have some other observable at disposal in addition to the strange quark cedm in order to constrain @xmath8 .    in this letter",
    ", we point out that the phase in the @xmath38 mixing parameter that would affect @xmath8 can also contribute to direct cp violation within the neutral kaon system , namely re ( @xmath6 ) through triple mass insertion .",
    "the feynman diagram for re ( @xmath6 ) with triple mass insertion [ fig .",
    "1 ( c ) ] is very similar to the feynman diagram for the strange quark cedm [ fig .  1 ( b ) ] .",
    "needless to say , making use of the observable re ( @xmath39 ) to constrain some susy soft breaking parameters also entails theoretical uncertainties mainly ascribed to our ignorance in the evaluation of the relevant hadronic matrix elements .",
    "our discussion shows that , even taking into account such a huge degree of uncertainty , re ( @xmath40 ) still constitutes a precious tool in constraining the interesting flavor changing mass insertion parameter @xmath27 , and , in any case , it plays at least a complementary role to the strange quark cedm in performing such a task .",
    "although the large @xmath0 mixing is well motivated in susy gut plus seesaw mechanism , we should emphasize that the link between re ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath8 is a generic feature of @xmath0 dominance scenario which in general can arise in other contexts .    for definiteness",
    ", we will work in the msugra boundary condition at the reduced planck scale @xmath41 gev , namely the flavor universal scalar mass parameter @xmath42 , and the trilinear couplings @xmath43 which is proportional to the yukawa couplings .",
    "then flavor changing off diagonal squark masses will be induced by the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution from @xmath44 down to @xmath45 gev , and subsequently from there to the @xmath46 scale @xcite : @xmath47_{ij }    ( 3 m_0 ^ 2 + a^2 ) \\left ( 3 \\log \\frac{m_*}{m_{\\rm gut } } +      \\log \\frac{m_{\\rm gut}}{m_{w } }       \\right),\\ ] ] from which one can estimate @xcite @xmath48 the @xmath49 or @xmath34 mixing will be small in this limit , and we ignore them in the following .    for the @xmath0 insertion",

    "such couplings intervene also in the evolution of the right - handed squark masses in the interval from the scale of appearance of the soft breaking terms down to the scale of right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "if at least some of such couplings are large ( for instance one of the dirac neutrino couplings could be of the order of the top yukawa couplings ) , then one can expect sizeable contributions to the rg induced off - diagonal entries in right - handed squark mass matrix .",

    "off - diagonal elements of the left - handed slepton mass matrix are given by @xmath193_{ki } [ v_l^*]_{kj }    ( 3 m_0 ^ 2 + a^2 ) \\log \\frac{m_*}{m_{n_k } } ,    \\label{eq : m2lij }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a way similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2dij ] ) . in order to estimate lepton flavor violation from this mass matrix",
    ", we should go to the super ckm basis .",
    "if the down - type quark and the charged lepton yukawa matrices are the same at the gut scale as @xmath194 the right - handed down - type squark and the charged slepton mass insertion parameters are unified as well . under this assumption ,",
    "the current upper bound on the @xmath195 branching ratio @xcite , @xmath196 translates into the limit @xcite , @xmath197 for @xmath198 .",
    "this is roughly 1/10 of the size of @xmath31 we used for @xmath172 tev , and we can not expect considerable change in @xmath8 satisfying the @xmath195 constraint .",
    "the assumption of yukawa unification , however , leads to an incorrect mass relation , @xmath199 and eq .  ( [ eq : yukawa - unif ] ) should be modified to account for the mass ratios of the first and second generation fermions . even in this case , a mass insertion involving a third generation is not much affected , and @xmath195 remains a strong constraint on @xmath8 .    in this work",
    ", we are considering susy gut with right - handed neutrinos as an example of a scenario that gives rise to large @xmath0 mixing .",
    "this is why @xmath195 constrains @xmath8 .",
    "here , we would like to stress again that the interconnection between re(@xmath79 ) and @xmath8 , unlike @xmath195 , is a common consequence of large @xmath0 mixing , which is not specific to susy gut .",
    "suppose that there is a large @xmath0 mixing but no @xmath37 mixing in the squark sector at the reduced planck scale due to a flavor symmetry and that we do not have a unified gauge group .",
    "even in this case , one has a strong correlation between re(@xmath79 ) and @xmath8 , while @xmath195 is unrelated to @xmath8 .",
    "if we considered more general scalar masses at @xmath44 with some flavor structures , then our results will be changed accordingly .",
    "the wilson coefficients for @xmath123 s for both @xmath200 have to include other mass insertion parameters such as @xmath90 , @xmath124 , @xmath89 , etc . , which were neglected in secs .",
    "ii and iii because they are small within the msugra scenarios .",
    "still we should make it sure that the new flavor physics that affects @xmath8 does not contribute to re(@xmath79 ) too much , and this could make a strong constraint on new sources of flavor and cp violation despite theoretical uncertainties in re(@xmath79 ) .",
    "in summary , we showed that if the @xmath0 @xmath11 transition is large with @xmath70 phase , it can affect not only @xmath8 through double mass insertion and the strange quark cedm through triple mass insertion , but it also affects re ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the correlation between the two observables are strong despite large hadronic uncertainties in both observables , within msugra boundary conditions with flavor universal scalar masses at @xmath44 .",
    "the current data on re ( @xmath6 ) indicates that @xmath8 should be in the range of @xmath201@xmath202 , which is now in accord with the present world average of @xmath8 .",
