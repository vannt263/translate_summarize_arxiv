    "the study of processes taken place in the continuum part of nuclear spectra is a difficult undertaking .",
    "this can be seen by the large number of methods that have been proposed to describe the continuum .",
    "besides the feshbach theory @xcite and its many versions , there are many methods where the continuum is described by a finite set of positive energy states .",
    "these states are usually obtained by expanding the solutions of the nuclear hamiltonian in a harmonic oscillator basis or by solving the eigenvalue problem with box boundary conditions .",
    "there have been also many variations of these procedures , e. g. by using a transformed harmonic oscillators basis @xcite or harmonic oscillators with different frequencies @xcite .",
    "the common feature of these representations is that they are constrained to real energy solutions , as required by quantum mechanics .",
    "however , the widths corresponding to decay processes were evaluated by means of outgoing waves ( and therefore complex energies ) already by gamow in his seminal paper on barrier penetration @xcite .",
    "the gamow states provide a natural definition of resonant states @xcite .",
    "berggren @xcite , and shortly afterwards romo @xcite , showed that the bound and gamow states together with a set of complex scattering states form a representation which spanns the space of complex energies . in this representation the scalar product ( the metric )",
    "is non - hermitian and the norm of the gamow states is defined by using a method introduced by zeldovich @xcite . later on techniques based on the complex rotation of the radial distance",
    "have been also used to regularise the gamow states and the matrix elements involving them @xcite .",
    "microscopical calculations based on a single - particle representation consisting of bound states , gamow resonances and complex energy scattering states ( berggren representation ) were proposed some years ago @xcite .",
    "this representation was recently expanded to study two - particle resonances @xcite .",
    "it may be surprising to see that it took such a long time for us ( after the paper in ref .",
    "@xcite ) to arrive to the two - particle representation .",
    "one of the reason of this delay is that only recently we have managed to find a method which allows one to isolate the physical two - particle resonant states from the continuous background , as it was schematically outlined in ref .",
    "the problem is that only a small fraction of the calculated states are physically relevant , since most of them ( if not all ) are either wide resonances or part of the non - resonant continuum .",
    "it is therefore important to be able to isolate the physically meaningful states from the rest of the spectrum . in this paper",
    "we will show how to achieve this .",
    "we will also show how two - particle resonances are built from the single - particle degrees of freedom determining the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is important since it is not clear how a two - particle resonance is formed .",
    "for instance , one may wonder to what extent such a state is built upon particles moving in resonant states as well as in non - resonant continuum states .",
    "intuitevely one would say that for the physically relevant two - particle resonances one of the two particles is in a narrow gamow state while the other moves in bound or quasi - bound states .",
    "wide resonances and the non - resonant continuum would play only a minor role , as assumed in refs .",
    "we will show that this intuitive assumption is not always supported by proper calculations .",
    "actually the question of the importance of the non - resonant continuum in the calculations was usually skiped in relation to processes taken place in the continuum part of the spectrum , particularly regarding radioactive decay where measurable life times correspond to very narrow resonances .",
    "therefore the calculation of the corresponding decay widths can be performed by using bound representations and the continuum itself can be totally ignored @xcite .",
    "this approximation , which was followed by nearly all available calculations of cluster decay ( including alpha particles and recent calculations of proton decay @xcite ) has been very succesful in explaining experimental data @xcite .",
    "this may have contributed to the lack of interest in methods which considered the continuum explicitely .",
    "but with the development of experimental facilities one could measure partial decay widths of neutrons from giant resonances and the continuum had to be included explicitely in the formalism @xcite .",
    "even more important , the experimental discovery of halo nuclei triggered a very fruitful theoretical activity which showed that halos can not be understood without taking into account wide resonances and other elements belonging to the continuum @xcite .",
    "all these elements are automatically included in the representation presented in this paper .",
    "the method , which is a generalization of the shell model to the complex energy plane , was briefly given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we will present it in detail here clarifying what a two - particle resonance is .",
    "we will also provide an insigth on the influence of the continuum upon the formation of two - particle resonances .",
    "the formalism is in sect .",
    "2 . in sect .",
    "3 are the applications and a summary and conclusions are in sect .",
    "the berggren ( one - particle ) representation to be used in this work has been described before in a number of situations , e. g. in refs .",
    "we will give here only a brief summary of the formalism .",
    "the regular solutions of the schrdinger equation with outgoing boundary conditions corresponding to a particle moving in a central potential provide the single - particle bound states and the so - called gamow resonances .",
    "the study of this case led @xcite to the introduction of expansions for the green- and @xmath0-functions in terms of the poles of the green - function plus an integral along a continuum path in the complex energy plane , i. e.    @xmath1    where we choose the integration path @xmath2 to lie in the fourth quadrant of the complex e - plane , as seen in fig .",
    "[ cont1 ] .",
    "the summation runs over all bound states and poles of the green function ( gamow resonances ) enclosed by the real e - axis and the contour @xmath2 .",
    "one can choose quite general forms for the contour , as can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it has to go through the origin and finish at infinite on the real energy axis .",
    "however , as in any shell - model calculation , one cuts the energies at a certain maximum value , which in fig .",
    "[ cont1 ] corresponds to the point @xmath3 .",
    "the other points defining the contour in that figure are , besides the origin , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in eq .",
    "[ eq : del ] the scattering functions on the contour are denoted by @xmath6 while the wave functions of the bound single - particle states and the gamow resonances are denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "these states have been indicated by open circles in fig .",
    "[ cont1 ] .",
    "an important feature in eq .",
    "( [ eq : del ] ) is that the scalar product is defined as the integral of the wave function times itself , and not its complex conjugate .",
    "this is in agreement with the hilbert metric on the real energy since for bound states or for scattering states on the real e - axis one can choose the phases such that the wave functions are real quantities .",
    "the prolongation of the integrand to the complex energy plane allows one to use the same form for the scalar product everywhere .",
    "this metric ( berggren metric ) produces complex probabilities , as has been discussed in detail in e. g. refs .",
    "here it is worthwhile to point out that for narrow resonances such probabilities become virtually real quantities .",
    "the integral in eq.([eq : del ] ) can be discretized such that    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined by the procedure one uses to perform the integration . in the gaussian method @xmath9 are the gaussian points and @xmath10 the corresponding weights .",
    "therefore the orthonormal ( in the berggren metric ) basis vectors @xmath11 are given by the set of bound and gamow states , i .",
    "e. @xmath12 and the discretized scattering states , i. e. @xmath13 .",
    "this defines the berggren representation .    by using the berggren representation one",
    "readily gets the two - particle shell - model equations , i. e. ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 labels two - particle states and @xmath16 label single - particle states .",
    "tilde denotes mirror states @xcite and the rest of the notation is standard .    as usual ,",
    "the two - particle wavefunction is ,    @xmath17    the discretization of the contour in fig .",
    "[ cont1 ] produces a series of points in the one - particle energy plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cont2 ] .",
    "each point in this figure represents a state of our one - particle berggren representation .",
    "therefore the energy of the two - particle basis vector @xmath18 , i. e. @xmath19 , is the sum of the point @xmath20 in fig .",
    "[ cont2 ] with the point @xmath21 . allowing the indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 to run over all the one - particle basis states , ordered such that @xmath22 , one obtains the energies of the two - particle basis states ( zeroth order energy ) in the corresponding ( two - particle ) complex energy plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ region1 ] .",
    "one sees in this figure that the whole complex energy plane of interest is covered by zeroth order solutions and , therefore , it would be difficult in this plane to find the physical two - particle states .",
    "this problem becomes more acute as the number of elements in the basis increases , that is as the number of points in fig .",
    "[ cont2 ] becomes larger , because the two - particle physical states would then be embeded in a dense number of states belonging to the continuum .",
    "a way to avoid this problem is to choose a one - particle contour which leaves a physically relevant two - particle complex energy region free of zeroth order states .",
    "there are many possible contours that satisfies this condition . in fig .",
    "[ cont3 ] we show one of such contours and the corresponding gamow resonances enclosed by it . since the bound states have to be considered in any case , irrespective of the contour , we do not include them in the discussion here .",
    "the contour has a rectangular form defined by the points @xmath23 and @xmath24 . as mentioned above",
    ", the number @xmath25 should be infinite .",
    "however , if one chooses @xmath25 large enough its value does not influence significantly the calculated quantities of interest . in the cases to be studied in the next section",
    "we will choose @xmath25 fulfilling such a condition .",
    "it is also worthwhile to mention that , due to the gaussian integration method , the point @xmath26 will not belong to the berggren representation .",
    "the lowest energy on the contour corresponds to the first gaussian point , i. e. @xmath27 .    by summing orderly the points of this figure with themselves one",
    "obtains the two - particle states shown in fig .",
    "[ region2 ] .",
    "one can see that if @xmath28 then there is a region in the two - particle complex energy plane which is practically free from any uncorrelated solution . choosing the real energies @xmath29 and @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ cont3 ] conveniently one can study two - particle resonances lying in any reasonable energy region .",
    "we will call this the `` allowed '' energy region . in fig .",
    "[ region2 ] all possible two - particle energy points have been drawn .",
    "the allowed region occupies a rather small portion of the figure and therefore it appears somehow diffuse among all the points . for clarity of presentation",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ allow ] the allowed region and its neighborhood only .",
    "the allowed region can be determined by fulfilling some physically meaningful requirements .",
    "that is , the correlated states of interest are those which live a time long enough before decaying . one",
    "would thus be able to observe them directly or through effects that they induce , for instance through the formation of halos .",
    "as we will show below , such states are built mainly by gamow resonances . therefore the contour in fig .",
    "[ cont3 ] should be chosen in such way as to enclose those resonances .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 should produce an allowed region where the calculated two - particle states may lie .",
    "since the two - body interaction is attractive one expects that the correlated low energy resonances would lie below their zeroth order positions in fig .",
    "[ allow ] .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath32 should be as small as possible while @xmath30 should be large , which are just the conditions needed to obtain the allowed region .",
    "once the berggren single - particle representation has been chosen , the two - particle representation is built as in the standard shell model , i. e. as the tensorial product of the one - particle representation with itself .",
    "this defines the two - particle space . in this space",
    "there are in zeroth order two - particle configurations containing gamow resonances only , which in fig .",
    "[ allow ] are indicated by open circles . besides these",
    ", one sees that inside the allowed region there are also configurations , indicated by dots , corresponding to one particle moving in a gamow resonance and the other in continuum states .",
    "these configurations can be seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ region2 ] , where the dots form two recognizable rectangles .",
    "each rectangle corresponds to the geometrical sum of a gamow resonance , represented by an open circle in fig .",
    "[ cont3 ] , and the scattering functions on the contour , represented by the crosses in that figure .",
    "in addition to the two - particle states involving gamow resonances there are also configurations , denoted by croses in figure 5 , in which both particles are in single - particle scattering states .",
    "one expects that physically relevant resonances are mostly determined by two - particle configurations in which both particles are in either bound or gamow states .",
    "since these states are the ones expected from the standard shell model , we will call them `` resonant shell model '' states .    in the applications shown in this article the central field determining the single - particle basis will be of a woods - saxon type with a spin - orbit term as in ref .",
    "the corresponding bound and gamow functions as well as the scattering states will be evaluated by using the computer codes described in refs .",
    "@xcite .    as a two - body interaction",
    "we will use a separable two - body force given by the derivative of the wood - saxon potential .",
    "this effective interaction has shown to be satisfactory to describe processes in the continuum , e. g. neutron decay from giant resonances @xcite . however , our purpose here is not to explain in detail physical processes in the continuum , but rather to understand the role played by the various ingredients entering into the calculations .",
    "the great feature of the separable force is that it does not require the diagonalization of matrices .",
    "this is important in our case since the dimension of the two - particle basis may be very large and we want to evaluate all states in order to examine the distribution of the energies of the resonant shell model and scattering states discussed above .    our effective interaction matrix element then is @xcite ,    [ eq : fpq ] @xmath33 where @xmath34    and @xmath35 is the volume part of the woods - saxon potential defining the central field .",
    "the rest of the notation is standard .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tda ] ) and ( [ mlett:1 ] ) one obtains the dispersion relation , @xmath36 which allows one to evaluate the correlated energies @xmath37 .    note that in eq .",
    "( [ mlett:2 ] ) the angular part of the matrix element was evaluated according to the hilbert metric , while in the radial part the berggren metric is used .",
    "note also that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disrel ] ) the square of the matrix element appears , and not the square of its absolute value .    in the case of a separable force",
    "the amplitude of the wave function can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 can be determined by the normalization condition , i. e. @xmath40    we will determine the strength of the separable force , i. e. @xmath41 , by using the usual procedure of fitting the energy of a two - particle state @xmath15 . however , in the drip lines nuclei which we will analyse there is not any experimental data yet and , therefore , we will assume that such state lies at a certain reasonable energy .",
    "we will also vary the value of @xmath41 thus obtained within a reasonable range in order to study the influence of the two - body interaction upon the calculated states .",
    "we will apply the formalism discussed above for two cases , one corresponding to a nucleus close to the neutron drip line and the other close to the proton drip line . in both nuclei",
    "we will analyse two - particle states with angular momentum @xmath42 .",
    "all partial waves with @xmath43 will be included to evaluate the scattering states in the berggren representation .      in this section",
    "we will present calculations for two - neutron states in the double closed shell nucleus @xmath44ni .",
    "the woods - saxon parameters are indicated in table [ wsp ] and the corresponding single - particle energies are in table [ sps ] .",
    "these single - particle states are quite similar to the ones given by a skyrme - hf calculations @xcite .    as seen in table [ sps ] , the shell @xmath45 is well defined , since there is a gap of about 3.6 mev between the lowest particle state , which here is @xmath46 , and the highest hole state , i. e. @xmath47 .",
    "we will also evaluate a case where no bound single - particle states are present .",
    "for this , we reduced the value of the depth of the wodds - saxon potential to @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding single particle energies are also given in table [ sps ] .",
    "note that even in this case the shell @xmath45 is rather well defined .",
    "we will first analyse the case where there are bound single - particle states , i. e. the case @xmath49 in table [ sps ] .    already from the start",
    "one faces the problem of determining which single - particle states are to be included . in a standard shell - model calculation one",
    "would include the states corresponding to a major shell only plus possibly an intruder state . in our case",
    "that would be the shell @xmath50=4 and the intruder state @xmath51 .",
    "however we have now the imaginary part of the energy to be taken into account .",
    "this may produce states with relatively small real parts of the energies but very large ( in absolute value ) imaginary parts .",
    "such states would induce very wide two - particle resonances and their inclusion would imply the use of contours embracing large portions of the complex energy plane which one would not expect to influence the narrow two - particle resonances of interest .",
    "we therefore decided to include all single - particle states up to a real energy of 6 mev and imaginary parts down to -4 mev .",
    "this correspond to all states shown in table [ sps ] .    as mentioned above , to determine the strength of the separable force we will follow the standard procedure of adjusting @xmath41 by fitting the energy of a two - particle state , which usually is experimentally known . in our case",
    "we will assume that such state , which would be the ground state of @xmath52ni , exists below twice the energy of the lowest single particle state , i. e. below 2@xmath53 .",
    "this energy gap , i. e. the correlation energy , is more than 1 mev in well established normal nuclei , like @xmath54pb ( where it is 1.244 mev ) and @xmath55ni ( 1.936 mev ) . however in our case",
    "the bound states are so few and so slightly bound that such high energy gaps do not seem to be reasonable . since there is not any experimental data which could guide us , and since our intention is just to see how the strength of the force affects the results , we will vary @xmath56 from zero to a maximum value corresponding to a gap of 2.527 mev , i. e. for a @xmath52ni(gs ) energy of -4.183 mev .",
    "the value of the strength corresponding to the berggren basis described below is @xmath56= 0.0028 mev .    in the calculations to be presented here we used a rectangular contour with the vertices as in fig .",
    "[ cont3 ] with a=0.5 mev , b=9 mev , c=-4 mev and d=20 mev .",
    "we thus include in the berggren basis all the gamow states shown in table [ sps ] plus the bound states @xmath46 and @xmath57 .",
    "with this contour the allowed region comprises the two - particle energy plane with complex energies @xmath58 such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "as already mentioned above , we will use a gaussian method of integration over the contour .",
    "we found that in order to obtain convergence within six digits in the evaluated quantities , one has to include 10 gaussian points for each mev on the lines of the contour in fig .",
    "[ cont3 ] , except for the last segment ( the one going from ( b,0 ) to ( d,0 ) ) where 5 points for each mev is enough .",
    "we arrive to this conclusion by always choosing the contour such that the resonances lie at least 300 kev from the borders of the contour .",
    "the number of scattering states thus included in the basis is @xmath61=225 .",
    "the convergence of the results as a function of @xmath61 as well as the influence of the continuum upon the calculated states will be given below .",
    "one can check the reliability of the results by performing a calculation over the real energy axis only .",
    "the real ( bound ) energies thus obtained , which are the standard shell - model results and therefore can be called `` exact '' , should coincide with those evaluated by using any contour . moreover , when evaluating the strength of the force by given a real energy @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disrel ] ) the value of @xmath41 thus obtained should , independently of the contour that one uses , be a real quantity .",
    "all these requirements are fulfilled in our calculations .",
    "this is important since it is a strong test of the reliability of our computing codes as well as a confirmation of the validity of the formalism .    in fig .",
    "[ g40 ] we show the energies evaluated by using different values of the strength @xmath41 .",
    "the energies follow the pattern discussed in the previous section .",
    "one can thus identify the distinctive straight lines corresponding to scattering configurations . for all g -",
    "values these lines appear practically in the same position .",
    "one can also see that the two - particle resonances can readily be distinguished from the scattering states by just looking at the figure .",
    "this is possible due to the presence of an allowed region which only contains the physical states .",
    "in the figure the physical states are labelled by their zeroth order configurations .",
    "one sees that as the interaction increases the real part of the energies behave in a standard shell - model fashion .",
    "thus , the states with largest degeneracy feels the interaction the most .",
    "moreover , the ground state departs from the rest of the spectrum more and more as the interaction increases , also in agreement with expectations .",
    "guided by these well established facts one may assume that narrow configurations , which due to the centrifugal barrier are usually the ones with highest degeneracy , would follow a similar pattern .",
    "that is , they would be dominant in buiding up the physical ( narrow ) two - particle resonances , as it was assumed in refs .",
    "but fig . [ g40 ] shows just the opposite .",
    "as the interaction increases all resonances become narrower , except the one corresponding to the configuration @xmath62 , which becomes wider .",
    "this unexpected feature is a consequence of the berggren metric , i. e. of the non - hermitian character of the hamiltonian matrix in the complex energy sector .",
    "similar properties , like violations of the non - crossing of levels rule , were found in the one - particle case @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the physical resonances in fig .",
    "[ g40 ] is rather involved .",
    "thus the states labelled @xmath63 become first narrower as the interaction increases but at a certain point , for @xmath41 = 0.002 mev in the figure , this tendency is reversed . at the same time the increase of -@xmath64 desaccelerates around the same value of @xmath41 for the states @xmath62 .    to understand the behaviour of the states @xmath62 we give in table [ wfh11 ] the main components of the corresponding wave functions .",
    "a feature to be noticed is that in no case are bound configurations relevant .",
    "as the interaction increases wide configurations become more and more important .",
    "this explains why the state becomes wider .",
    "however , the bound configuration @xmath65 start to become relevant at a large enough value of @xmath41 .",
    "thus at @xmath41 = 0.002 mev that configuration contributes with a value of 0.14 to the wave function .",
    "this becomes more important as @xmath41 becomes larger , thus desaccelerating the increase of the widths .",
    "on the other hand , the wave functions of the states @xmath63 presented in table [ wfd3 ] show that narrow configurations ( more exactly , configurations narrower than the zeroth order one , which here is @xmath63 ) contribute substantially to the structure of the state as the interaction increases , particularly the narrow states @xmath62 and @xmath66 and the bound configuration @xmath65 .",
    "this explains why the states @xmath63 becomes narrower as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "but as @xmath41 increases scattering configurations become important and , as a result , the states become wider .",
    "an interesting feature in this contex is the sudden appearence of a large contribution ( of a value ( 0.42,0.18 ) ) from a scattering configuration at @xmath41 = 0.0024 mev .",
    "this corresponds to the configuration @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the scattering function at ( 0.385,0 ) mev .",
    "this is a gaussian point on the first border of the contour .",
    "the energy of the configuration @xmath69 is ( in mev ) ( 1.325,-0.479 ) + ( 0.385,0 ) = ( 1.710,-0.479 ) , which is very close to the energy of the resonance , i. e. ( 1.665,-0.447 ) .",
    "this can even be inferred from fig .",
    "[ g40 ] where the down open triangle for the case @xmath63 being discussed here practically overlaps with our continuum configuration @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfa ] ) , the corresponding wave function component is large .",
    "the unexpected behaviour of the resonances discussed above is representative for all the others in fig .",
    "[ g40 ] , while the bound states behave in a standard shell - model fashion .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that the first excited bound states ( labelled @xmath70 in the figure ) do not show any remarkable sensitivity to scattering states , although they lie close to the continuum threshold .",
    "indeed , the wave functions corresponding to these states consist mainly of the configurations @xmath65 and @xmath70 for all values of @xmath41",
    ".    one important feature of the calculation is that the energies corresponding to physical states converge to their exact values relatively fast as a function of the dimension of the basis .",
    "this we show for the states @xmath63 and @xmath62 in tables [ wf3conv ] and [ wf11conv ] respectively . to assess whether the strength of the interaction affects the convergence we have chosen different values of @xmath41 .",
    "we thus see that indeed the energy corresponding to @xmath41 = 0.0004 mev , which is the smallest g - value shown in those tables , coincides within a few kev with the exact result already for @xmath61 = 0 . but as @xmath41 is increased that agreement deteriorates .",
    "particularly inadequate are the energies evaluated by using @xmath61 = 0 for the states @xmath62 and @xmath71 0.0020 mev . not only are the real parts of those energies wrong by an ammount ranging from 1.2 mev ( for @xmath41= 0.0020 mev ) to almost 2 mev , but also the imaginary parts are large and positive , which does not make sense since it would correspond , e. g. , to negative widths",
    ". this last feature does not appear for the states @xmath63 .",
    "one can understand the deterioration of the resonant shell model results ( i .e .",
    "of neglecting the continuum by using @xmath61 = 0 ) as the strength increases by noticing that it is trough the interaction that continuum configurations become relevant in the calculation .",
    "this also explains why the results corresponding to @xmath61 = 0 for the states @xmath63 are generally better than those corresponding to @xmath62 since here the interaction is stronger ( due to the degeneracy ) for a given value of @xmath41 .",
    "but already with @xmath61 = 10 the agreement between the exact results and the approximated ones is reasonable in all these cases of physical states .",
    "moreover , for @xmath61 = 100 the exact results are reproduced within 6 digits .",
    "this convergence is better than the one required to achieve a similar agreement in general , for which one needs the value @xmath61 = 225 used in our calculations , as mentioned above .",
    "finally it is worthwhile to point out that the presence of scattering states lying nearby physical states do not affect the convergence , as seen in e. g. table [ wf3conv ] for the state @xmath63 with @xmath41 = 0.0024 mev ( cf .",
    "figure [ g40 ] ) .      in this subsection we will analyse the case where there is not any bound single - particle states , i. e. the case @xmath72 in table [ sps ] .",
    "actually there is not any essential difference between this case and the previous one since within this formalism all states ( including the continuum states ) are treated on the same footing , indepedently of the location of the fermi level .",
    "the single - particle resonances are wider than before and therefore we used here a different one - particle contour , namely a=0.1 mev , b=13 mev , c=-6 mev and d= 26 mev .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ g37 ] the evaluated states as a function of the strength @xmath41 , which we allowed to vary within the same range as in the previous case .",
    "the straight lines discussed above appear also in this case with the same characteristics as before .",
    "even the physical resonances present the same features as in the previous subsection .",
    "in particular , the states labelled @xmath62 interacts strongly with all the others thereby becoming wider while all the other states become narrower .",
    "however there is a new important feature in this case , namely the development of a bound state which is induced by the two - particle interaction , as shown by the states @xmath65 . to analyse the reason of this behaviour we present in table [ wfd5 ] the main components of the corresponding wavefunctions .",
    "as expected , one sees that when the interaction is weak the state is built practically by the configuration @xmath65 only . as @xmath41 increases the two - particle resonance approaches the continuum threshold and scattering states contribute substantially to the wave function .",
    "thus , the state under the column labelled @xmath73 corresponding to @xmath41 = 0.0012 mev is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a scattering d - wave at energy ( 0.089,0 ) mev . at @xmath41 = 0.0020 mev",
    "the resonance approaches threshold even more and here the continuum itself becomes important .",
    "indeed , the large contribution under the column @xmath73 corresponds now to the configuration @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a scattering s - wave with an energy ( 0.011,0 ) mev , itself very close to threshold .",
    "as the interaction increases even more the state becomes bound and at @xmath41 = 0.0028 mev the scattering states cease to be important .",
    "but the interaction is here strong enough to mix up all the shell model configurations , showing the importance of gamow resonances in inducing bound states in nuclei that lie far from the line of @xmath78 stability .",
    "proton resonances are usually narrower than the corresponding neutron ones due to the coulomb barrier .",
    "it is therefore often in this case that one study many - body systems including only the narrow gamow resonances . in this section",
    "we analyse this approximation for the case of two protons outside the @xmath79sn core .",
    "the single - particle proton states correspond to the major shell n=4 , which is the same as in the previous subsections .",
    "the core mean field is described by a wood - saxon potential with the parameters given in table [ wsp ] .",
    "these parameters were adjusted to obtain the single - particle states shown in table [ spsp ] , which agree with systematics in this region .",
    "notice that none of these single - particle states is bound .    as in the neutron case analysed above",
    "we include in our single - particle representation even states which belong to higher shells , namely the states @xmath80 and @xmath81 , because they are relatively narrow .",
    "we include these high lying shells in order to assess whether they can be neglected , as one does within the standard shell model .",
    "we chose even here the rectangular contour of fig .",
    "[ cont3 ] with vertices defined by the values @xmath29 = 0.1 mev , @xmath30 = 19 mev , @xmath31 = -1 mev and @xmath25 = 26 mev .",
    "this contour encloses all the gamow resonances of table [ spsp ] . choosing the gaussian points",
    "as indicated above in order to obtain a precision of six digits , the number of scattering states for each partial wave turns out to be @xmath61 = 298 .    with the single - particle ( berggren ) representation",
    "thus established we calculated the complex two - particle energies by solving the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disrel ] ) .",
    "the corresponding wave functions were evaluated by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfa ] ) .",
    "we used in our calculations of the two - proton states , which would be resonances in @xmath82te , values of the strength @xmath41 in a range similar to that in the neutron cases analysed in the previous subsections .",
    "the results of the calculation are shown in fig .",
    "the general trends in this figure are similar to the ones already found for the two - neutron cases .",
    "one notices that even in this case where all resonances are very narrow , the narrowest resonance in zeroth order becomes wider as the interaction increases while all the other become narrower .",
    "this is specially remarkable for the state that at zeroth order is @xmath70 , since one does not expect that a state with such low degeneracy would be important to build up low lying resonances . to analyse these states we present in table [ pps1 ]",
    "the corresponding wave function amplitudes for values of the strength @xmath41 used in fig .",
    "[ pp ] . as expected according to what we found for the neutron cases above",
    ", the reason why these states become narrower is that narrow configurations play an important role as the interaction increases .",
    "however this trend is not as specific as before , when just the narrowest neutron configuration ( which was @xmath62 ) contributed most to the narrowing wave function .",
    "the equivalent shell is now @xmath66 , which first ( at low values of @xmath41 ) is important but then decreases as the strength increases . perhaps even more amazing",
    "is the behaviour of the shell @xmath63 which first increase in importance but suddenly , starting at @xmath41 = 0.0010 mev , decrease again .",
    "these features indicate again that the behaviour of the wave functions in the berggren space can follow patterns which are unusual from a standard shell model viewpoint .",
    "the only configuration in table [ pps1 ] which increases continuously in absolute value as @xmath41 increases is @xmath65 , which is also very narrow and may explain why these two - proton resonances become narrower .",
    "the other notable states in fig .",
    "[ pp ] are those labelled @xmath65 , which are very narrow for all values of @xmath41 and which rapidly decrease in energy as @xmath41 increases , as expected for a pairing ( ground ) excitation . eventually the state becomes bound for a value of the strength large enough , which in the figure is between 0.0014 mev and 0.0016 mev . to study the changing structure of these pairing states",
    "we show in table [ ppd5 ] the corresponding amplitudes as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "as expected from truly pairing vibrations @xcite , the number of equally important configurations increases with the strength of the pairing force .",
    "moreover the real parts of the wave function components ( which actually are virtually real numbers ) carry the phase @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the orbital angular momentum of the corresponding single - particle states . in this subject of pairing vibrations the results of the method presented here and those of the standard shell - model coincide .    in this case of very narrow gamow resonances one notices that in the two - particle wave functions the scattering states do not seem to play an important role ( cf . table [ wfd3 ] ) .",
    "to analyse this point we present in table [ snen ] the dependence of the calculated energies , also for the states labelled @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ pp ] , upon the number of scattering states @xmath61 included in the berggren basis .",
    "the general features of the results in this table do not differ much from those found in tables [ wf3conv ] and [ wf11conv ] .",
    "that is , for small values of the strength @xmath41 the evaluated energies reach fast its exact value as @xmath61 increases . but",
    "this convergence wanes as @xmath41 increases .",
    "thus the energy evaluated by neglecting the scattering states agrees with the exact results within a few kev for @xmath41 = 0.0002 mev but disagrees strongly for @xmath41 = 0.0016 mev .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the corresponding wave functions converge as badly as the energies do for large values of the strength .",
    "this we show in table [ snwf ] , where we use the extreme case @xmath41 = 0.0016 mev .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , one sees that the main components of the wave functions evaluated for @xmath61 = 0 agrees within a few percent with the exact ones .",
    "this shows that the use of only narrow gamow resonances , neglecting the continuum , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , may be appropriate to evaluate wave functions although the energies thus obtained are inadequate .",
    "in this paper we have presented a formalism to evaluate microscopically two - particle resonances within the berggren representation .",
    "this consists of bound states , gamow resonances and an infinite ( continuous ) set of complex scattering states lying on a contour in the complex one - particle energy plane .",
    "the gamow states included in the representation are those enclosed by the contour .",
    "the scattering states appear as an integral over the contour .",
    "we discretized this integral by using a gaussian integration procedure .",
    "therefore the infinte set of scattering states becomes reduced to the finite value @xmath61 of gaussian points . using this finite berggren basis",
    "we constructed the two - particle basis set of states as the tensorial product of the one - particle basis with itself , as in standard shell model calculations .",
    "we have shown that using an arbitrary contour one may get a two - particle basis with energies covering the whole two - particle complex energy plane of interest .",
    "this would hinder the evaluation of two - particle states since they would be embedded in a continuos set of basis states . to avoid this drawback",
    "we have shown that there exists a contour that leaves a region in the two - particle complex energy plane free of basis states .",
    "it is just in this region where the physically relevant resonances lie . using that contour",
    "we have evaluated all two - particle resonances with a precision of six digits by choosing @xmath61 with values between 150 and 300 , depending upon the case under study .",
    "but we have found that with @xmath85 one obtains a precision of a few kev for the energies of the relevant resonances , while the corresponding wave functions are provided within a precision of a few percent by neglecting the scattering states altogether , i. e. with @xmath86 = 0 .",
    "we have applied the formalism to study neutron excitations in @xmath44ni and proton ones in @xmath79sn .",
    "the single - particle states were provided by a woods - saxon potential and we chose a separable force as the two - particle effective interaction .",
    "for the neutron case we analysed a case where the fermi level was bound and another one where it lied in the continuum . in both cases wide resonances were included in the basis .",
    "for the proton case the fermi level also lied in the continuum but here all gamow resonances were narrow .",
    "we have shown that the position of the fermi level is irrelevant , since all basis states are treated on the same footing .",
    "we have shown that the states which in zeroth order consist of configurations containing scattering states feel the interaction very weakly . instead , the physical states consist mainly of configurations containing only bound states and gamow resonances .",
    "these configurations are the ones expected from the shell model . even in cases where no bound configurations are present",
    ", the two - body interaction may induce narrow resonances and bound two - particle states .",
    "we found that the narrowest of those configurations in zeroth order become wider as the interaction increases . at the same time , all the other states become narrower .",
    "this unexpected result , which is induced by the berggren metric , shows that physically relevant resonances , i. e. narrow ones , may be strongly influenced by states lying deep in the continuum .",
    "although the wave functions of the physical two - particle resonances are mainly built upon shell model configurations , the corresponding energies are strongly influenced by scattering states .",
