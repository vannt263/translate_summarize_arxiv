    "much attention has been directed by theoretical / computational chemists towards developing reliable and accurate means for solving dynamical quantum mechanics problems  i.e . , for obtaining solutions to the time - dependent  equation  for molecular systems .",
    "insofar as `` exact '' quantum methods are concerned , two traditional approaches have been used : ( 1 ) representation of the system hamiltonian in a finite , direct - product basis set ; ( 2 ) discretization of the wavefunction onto a rectilinear grid of lattice points over the relevant region of configuration space . both approaches",
    ", however , suffer from the drawback that the computational effort scales exponentially with system dimensionality.@xcite recently , a number of promising new methods have emerged with the potential to alleviate the exponential scaling problem once and for all .",
    "these include various basis set optimization methods,@xcite and build - and - prune methods,@xcite such as those based on wavelet techniques.@xcite    on the other hand , a completely different approach to the exponential scaling problem is to use basis sets or grid points , that themselves evolve over time .",
    "the idea is that at any given point in time , one need sample a much smaller hilbert subspace , or configuration space region , than would be required at all times  thus substantially reducing the size of the calculation . for basis set calculations , much progress along these lines has been achieved by the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) method , developed by meyer , manthe and co - workers.@xcite more recently , time - evolving grid , or `` quantum trajectory '' methods@xcite ( qtms ) have also been developed , and for certain types of systems , successfully applied at quite high dimensionalities.@xcite    qtms are based on the hydrodynamical picture of quantum mechanics , developed over half a century ago by bohm@xcite and takabayasi,@xcite who built on the earlier work of madelung@xcite and van vleck.@xcite qtms are inherently appealing for a number of reasons .",
    "first , they offer an intuitive , classical - like understanding of the underlying dynamics , which is difficult - to - impossible to extract from more traditional fixed grid / basis methods . in effect , quantum trajectories are like ordinary classical trajectories , except that they evolve under a modified potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the wavefunction - dependent `` quantum potential '' correction .",
    "second , qtms hold the promise of delivering exact quantum mechanical results without exponential scaling in computational effort .",
    "third , they provide a pedagogical understanding of entirely quantum mechanical effects such as tunneling@xcite and interference.@xcite they have already been used to solve a variety of different types of problems , including barrier transmission,@xcite non - adiabatic dynamics,@xcite and mode relaxation.@xcite several intriguing phase space generalizations have also emerged,@xcite of particular relevance for dissipative systems.@xcite    despite this success , qtms suffer from a significant numerical drawback , which , to date , precludes a completely robust application of these methods .",
    "namely : qtms are numerically unstable in the vicinity of amplitude nodes .",
    "this `` node problem '' manifests in several different ways:@xcite ( 1 ) infinite forces , giving rise to kinky , erratic trajectories ; ( 2 ) compression / inflation of trajectories near wavefunction local extrema / nodes , leading to ; ( 3 ) insufficient sampling for accurate derivative evaluations .",
    "nodes are usefully divided into two categories,@xcite depending on whether @xmath5 is formally well - behaved ( `` type one '' nodes ) or singular ( `` type two '' nodes ) . for stationary state solutions to the  equation , for instance , all nodes are type one nodes . in principle ,",
    "type one nodes are `` gentler '' than type two nodes ; however , from a numerical standpoint , even type one nodes will give rise to the problems listed above , because the slightest numerical error in the evaluation of @xmath5 is sufficient to cause instability .",
    "in the best case , the node problem simply results in substantially more trajectories and time steps than the corresponding classical calculation ; in the worst case , the qtm calculation may fail altogether , beyond a certain point in time .",
    "several numerical methods , both `` exact '' and approximate , are currently being developed to deal with this important problem .",
    "the latter category includes the artificial viscosity@xcite and linearized quantum force methods,@xcite both of which have proven to be very stable . while such approximate methods may not capture the hydrodynamic fields with complete accuracy in nodal regions , they do allow for continued evolution and long - time solutions , often unattainable via use of a traditional qtm .",
    "the `` exact '' methods include the adaptive hybrid methods,@xcite and the complex amplitude method.@xcite in the adaptive hybrid methods , for which hydrodynamic trajectories are evolved everywhere except for in nodal regions , where the time - dependent schrodinger equation is solved instead to avoid node problems .",
    "although they have been applied successfully for some problems , these methods are difficult to implement numerically , since not only must the hydrodynamic fields be somehow monitored for forming singularities , but there must also be an accurate means for interfacing and coupling the two completely different equations of motion . the complex amplitude method is cleaner to implement , but is only exact for linear and quadratic hamiltonians .",
    "in a recent paper,@xcite hereinafter referred to as `` paper  i , '' one of the authors ( poirier ) introduced a new strategy for dealing with the node problem , based on a bipolar decomposition of the wavefunction .",
    "the idea is to partition the wavefunction into two ( or in principle , more ) component functions , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "one then applies qtm propagation separately to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which can be linearly superposed to generate @xmath1 itself at any desired later time .",
    "in essence , this works because the  equation itself is linear , but the equivalent bohmian mechanical , or quantum hamilton s equations of motion ( qhem ) are not.@xcite in principle , therefore , one may improve the numerical performance of qtm calculations simply by judiciously dividing up the initial wavepacket into pieces .",
    "although bipolar decompositions have been around for quite some time,@xcite their use as a tool for circumventing the node problem for qtm calculations is quite recent .",
    "two promising new exact methods that seek to accomplish this are the so - called `` counter - propagating wave '' method ( cpwm),@xcite and the `` covering function '' method ( cfm).@xcite in the cpwm , the bipolar decomposition is chosen to correspond to the semiclassical wkb approximation,@xcite for which all of the hydrodynamic field functions are smooth and classical - like , and the component wavefunctions are node - free . interference is achieved naturally , via the superposition of left- and right - traveling ( i.e. positive- and negative - momentum ) waves . for one - dimensional ( 1d ) stationary bound states , it can be shown that the resultant bipolar quantum potential @xmath7 becomes arbitrarily small in the large action limit , even though the number of nodes becomes arbitrarily large .",
    "( note : in accord with the convention established in ref .",
    ", upper / lower case will be used to denote the unipolar / bipolar field quantities ) . in the cfm ,",
    "the idea is to superpose some well - behaved large - amplitude wave , with the actual ill - behaved ( nodal or wildly oscillatory ) wave , so as to `` dilute '' the undesirable numerical ramifications of the latter .",
    "this paper is the second in a series designed to explore the cpwm approach , introduced in paper  i. as discussed there in greater detail , there are many motivations for this approach , but the primary one is to reconcile the semiclassical and bohmian theories , in a manner that preserves the best features of both , and also satisfies the correspondence principle . for our purposes",
    ", this means that the lagrangian manifolds ( lms ) for the two theories should become identical in the large action limit ( sec .",
    "[ scattering ] ) .",
    "as described above , a key benefit of the cpwm decomposition is an elegant treatment of interference , the chief source of nodes and `` quasi - nodes''@xcite ( i.e. rapid oscillations ) in quantum mechanical systems .",
    "an interesting perspective on the role of interference in semiclassical and bohmian contexts is to be found in a recent article by zhao and makri.@xcite    whereas paper  i focused on stationary bound states for 1d systems , the present paper ( paper  ii ) and the next in the series ( paper  iii)@xcite concern themselves with stationary scattering states .",
    "the cpwm decomposition of paper  i is uniquely specified for any arbitrary 1d state  bound or scattering  and in the bound case , always satisfies the correspondence principle .",
    "however , the non-@xmath8 nature of the scattering states is such that the paper  i decomposition generally does _ not _ satisfy the correspondence principle in this case .",
    "simply put , the quantum trajectories and lms exhibit oscillatory behavior in at least one asymptotic region ( thereby manifesting reflection ) , whereas the semiclassical lms do not .",
    "this is not a limitation of the cpwm , but is rather due to the fundamental failure of the basic wkb approximation to predict any reflection whatsoever for above - barrier energies , as has been previously well established.@xcite in semiclassical theory , a modification must therefore be made to the basic wkb approximation , in order to obtain meaningful scattering quantities . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ scattering ] and in paper  iii , our approach will be to apply a similar modification to the exact quantum decomposition ( actually , a _ reverse _ modification ) such that the correspondence principle remains satisfied , and the two theories thus reconciled , even for scattering systems .",
    "it will be shown the modified cpwm gives rise to bipolar bohmian lms that are _ identical _ to the semiclassical lms , regardless of whether or not the action is large .",
    "put another way , this means that the bipolar quantum potentials @xmath9 effectively _ vanish _ , so that the resultant quantum trajectory evolution is _",
    "completely classical_. moreover , the resultant component wavefunctions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , correspond asymptotically to the familiar `` incident , '' `` transmitted , '' and `` reflected '' waves of traditional scattering theory .",
    "thus , the modified cpwm implementation of the bipolar bohmian approach provides a natural generalization of these conceptually fundamental entities _ throughout all of configuration space _",
    ", not just in the asymptotic regions , as is the case in conventional quantum scattering theory .",
    "the above conclusions will be demonstrated for both discontinuous and continuous potential systems , in papers  ii and  iii , respectively",
    ". discontinuous potentials  e.g .",
    "the hard wall , the step potential , and the square barrier / well  serve as a useful benchmark for the modified cpwm approach , because the scattering component waves ( e.g. `` incident wave , '' etc . ) in this case _ are _ well - defined throughout all of configuration space , according to a conventional scattering treatment .",
    "although this is no longer true for continuous potentials , the foundation laid here in paper  ii can be extended to the continuous ( and also time - dependent ) case as well , as described in paper  iii .",
    "additional motivation for the development of a scattering version of the cpwm , vis - a - vis the relevance for chemical physics applications , is provided in paper  iii .",
    "additional motivation for the consideration of discontinuous potentials is provided in sec .",
    "[ scattering ] of the present paper .",
    "according to the bohmian formulation,@xcite the qhem are derived via substitution of the 1d ( unipolar ) wavefunction ansatz , ( x , t ) = r(x , t ) e^i s(x , t)/ into the time - dependent  equation . for the 1d hamiltonian ,",
    "h = -^2 2 m ^2 x^2 + v(x ) , [ hameqn ] this results in the coupled pair of nonlinear partial differential equations , where @xmath12 is the mass , @xmath13 is the system potential , and primes denote spatial partial differentiation .",
    "the first of the two equations above is the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation ( qhje ) , whose last term is equal to @xmath14 , i.e. comprises the quantum potential correction .",
    "the second equation is a continuity equation .",
    "when combined with the quantum trajectory evolution equations , i.e. the continuity equation ensures that the probability [ i.e. density , @xmath15 , times volume element ] carried by individual quantum trajectories is conserved over the course of their time evolution .      in paper",
    "i , we derived a unique bipolar decomposition , ( x ) = _ + ( x ) + _ -(x ) , [ bipolardecomp ] for stationary eigenstates @xmath16 of 1d hamiltonians of the form , such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath17 are themselves ( non-@xmath8 ) solutions to the  equation , with the same eigenvalue , @xmath18 , as @xmath16 itself .",
    "the invariant flux values , @xmath19 , of the two solutions , @xmath17 , equal those of the two semiclassical ( wkb ) solutions .",
    "the median of the enclosed action , @xmath20 , equals that of the semiclassical solutions .",
    "there are other important properties of the @xmath17,@xcite as discussed in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , and in ref .  .",
    "nevertheless , the above three conditions are sufficient to uniquely specify the decomposition . in the special case of",
    "bound ( i.e. @xmath8 ) stationary states , the real - valuedness of @xmath16 implies that the @xmath17 are complex conjugates of each other .",
    "it is natural to ask to what extent the above analysis may be generalized for scattering potentials . certainly , @xmath16 itself is no longer @xmath8 , nor even real - valued , and there are generally two linearly independent solutions of interest for each @xmath18 , instead of just one .",
    "condition ( 1 ) above poses no difficulty for @xmath17 , as these component functions are non-@xmath8 and complex - valued , even in the bound eigenstate case . in principle , condition ( 2 ) is not difficult either ; although the flux value depends on the normalization of @xmath1 itself , which is not @xmath8 , certain well - established normalization conventions for scattering states exist , that can be applied equally well to semiclassical and exact quantum solutions .",
    "there is no action median _ per se _ for scattering states , as the action enclosed within the @xmath21 and @xmath22 phase space lagrangian manifolds@xcite ( lms ) is infinite ; however , the scattering analog of condition ( 3 ) is related to the asymptotic boundary conditions , and it is here that one encounters difficulty .",
    "moreover , an additional concern is raised by the doubly - degenerate nature of the continuum eigenstates , namely : should each scattering @xmath16 have its _ own _",
    "@xmath17 decomposition , or should there be a single @xmath17 pair , from which all degenerate @xmath16 s may be constructed via arbitrary linear superposition ?    to resolve these issues , we will adopt the same general strategy used in paper i , i.e. we will resort to semiclassical theory as our guide , wherever possible .",
    "we will also exploit certain special features of the scattering problem not found in generic bound state systems , such as the asymptotic potential condition @xmath23 as @xmath24 ( where primes denote spatial differentiation ) , and its usual implications for scattering theory and applications.@xcite    the basic wkb solutions are given by ^(x ) = r_(x ) e^i s_(x)/ , [ scsoln ] where r_(x ) = s_(x ) = [ scrs ] the corresponding positive and negative momentum functions , specifying the semiclassical lms , are given by @xmath25",
    ". equations ( [ scsoln ] ) and ( [ scrs ] ) apply to both bound and scattering cases ; note that for both , @xmath26 are complex conjugates of each other .",
    "the asymptotic potential condition ensures that these approach exact quantum plane waves asymptotically , with the usual scattering interpretations , i.e. @xmath21 in the @xmath27 asymptotic region is the incoming wave from the left ( usually taken to be the incident wave ) , @xmath21 as @xmath28 is the outgoing wave from the left ( the usual transmitted wave ) , etc .    insofar as determining the corresponding exact quantum solutions @xmath17 , the procedure described in paper i is still appropriate for bound and semi - bound ( i.e. on one side only ) states , in that the results satisfy the correspondence principle globally , as desired ( for semi - bound examples , consult the appendix ) . for true scattering states",
    ", however , this procedure fails , in the sense that if @xmath21 is chosen to match the normalization and flux of @xmath29 in the @xmath28 asymptote , then it will necessarily approach a nontrivial linear superposition of @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the @xmath31 asymptote , and vice - versa .",
    "there is therefore an ambiguity as to how the corresponding quantum @xmath17 s should be defined , i.e. which asymptotic region should be used to effect the correspondence . more significantly",
    "though , _ either _ choice will result in component functions @xmath17 with substantial interference in one of the two asymptotic regions .",
    "this is due to partial reflection of the exact quantum scattering states , which is not predicted by the basic wkb approximation .",
    "thus , in the large action limit , the exact quantum solutions manifest large - magnitude quantum potentials , @xmath32 , and rapidly oscillating field functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34exactly the undesirable behavior that the cpwm was introduced to avoid  whereas the corresponding basic wkb functions are smooth , and asymptotically uniform .",
    "the lack of any partial reflection is a well - understood shortcoming of the wkb approximation@xcite  i.e .",
    ", the basic @xmath26 components , though elegantly constructed from smooth classical functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , do not in and of themselves correspond to any actual quantum scattering solutions @xmath16 . in light of the bipolar decomposition ideas introduced in paper i , however , our perspective is the reverse one : for any _ actual _ quantum @xmath16 , can one determine an decomposition such that the resultant @xmath17 resemble their well - behaved semiclassical counterparts , and is such a decomposition unique ?",
    "among other properties,@xcite the @xmath17 lm s should become identical to the semiclassical lm s in the large action limit , so as to satisfy the correspondence principle .",
    "based on the considerations of the previous paragraph it is clear that the paper i decomposition does not achieve this goal , when applied to stationary scattering states .",
    "we defer a full accounting of these issues  in the context of completely arbitrary continuous potentials @xmath13to paper  iii , wherein it will be demonstrated how to compute exact quantum reflection and transmission probabilities ( and stationary scattering states ) using only classical trajectories , and without the need for explicit numerical differentiation of the wavefunction . in the present paper",
    ", we lay the foundation for paper iii , by focusing attention onto two key aspects whose development comprises an essential prerequisite .",
    "first , as the paper iii approach treats @xmath13 as a sequence of steps,@xcite the present paper  ii will focus exclusively on the step potential and related discontinuous potential systems , for which @xmath37 in between successive steps .",
    "discontinuous potentials are important for chemical physics , because they model steep repulsive wells , and are used in statistical theories of liquids .",
    "moreover , they hold a special significance for qtm methods , for which they serve as a `` worst - case scenario '' benchmark . indeed , conventional qtm techniques _",
    "always _ fail when applied to discontinuous potentials . to date",
    ", the only such calculations that have been performed@xcite have computed the quantum potential from a completely separate time - dependent fixed - grid calculation ( the `` analytical approach'')@xcite rather than directly from the quantum trajectories themselves .",
    "even if one _ could _ propagate trajectories for discontinous systems using a traditional qtm , the trajectories that would be generated would be very kinky and erratic,@xcite and a great many time trajectories and time steps would thus be required .",
    "second , since the new @xmath17 do _ not _ satisfy condition ( 1 ) , unlike the paper  i cpwm decomposition , the time evolution of these two component functions is clearly not that of the time - dependent  equation . moreover , since the @xmath38 are constant over time [ because @xmath39 itself is stationary , and is presumed unique ] , _ the two @xmath40 time evolutions must be coupled together_. it is essential that the nature of this coupling be completely understood , in order that the present approach may be generalized to non - stationary state situations  e.g . to wavepacket scattering , as will be discussed in future publications .",
    "the ramifications for qtms are equally important .",
    "accordingly , the present paper focuses on the qtm propagation of the wavefunction and its bipolar components  with a keen eye towards generality and physical interpretation  even though the states involved are stationary .",
    "this approach leads to a pedagogically useful reinterpretation of `` incident , '' `` transmitted , '' and `` reflected '' waves  very reminiscent of ray optics in electromagnetic theory  which is applicable much more generally than traditional usage might suggest .",
    "the necessary theory will be developed over the course of a consideration of various model application systems of increasing complexity .",
    "let us first consider the simplest case imaginable , the free particle system , @xmath41 . in this case , the exact solutions @xmath42 clearly satisfy the conditions of sec .",
    "[ bipolar ] , and the bipolar quantum potentials @xmath32 are zero everywhere .",
    "thus , the bipolar decomposition developed for bound states in paper i can be used directly with this continuum system , requiring only the slight modification that arbitrary linear combinations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are to be allowed , in order to construct arbitrary scattering solutions @xmath16 . for convenience ,",
    "the linear combination coefficients will from here on out be directly incorporated into the amplitude functions , @xmath33 , and phase functions , @xmath45 , so that is still correct .    if from all solutions @xmath16 one considers only that which satisfies the usual scattering boundary conditions ( i.e. incident wave incoming from the left ) then the negative momentum wave @xmath46 vanishes , and @xmath47 .",
    "there is zero reflection , and @xmath48 transmission .",
    "put another way , the incident flux , @xmath49 , is equal to the transmitted flux , @xmath50 , where [ both flux values are equal to @xmath51 , as in ] .    in the quantum trajectory description ,",
    "flux manifests as probability - transporting trajectories , which move along the lms . for the boundary conditions described above",
    ", there are only positive momentum trajectories , moving uniformly from left to right with momentum @xmath52 .",
    "if a @xmath22 contribution were present , its trajectories would move uniformly in the opposite direction [ @xmath53 . ] since the two components @xmath17 are in this case uncoupled , the positive and negative momentum trajectories would have no interaction with each other .",
    "we next consider the hard wall system : v(x ) = in the @xmath54 region , the two @xmath17 components are exactly the same as in the free particle case , except that the @xmath55 boundary condition imposes the additional constraints , s_-(0 ) = s_+(0 ) + ( 2 ) ; r_-(0 ) = r_+(0 ) .",
    "[ hwconst ] this also results in only _",
    "one _ linearly independent solution instead of two , i.e. @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "regarding the lms and trajectories , in the @xmath58 region , these are identical to those of sec .  [ free ] , e.g. the @xmath21 lm trajectories move uniformly to the right , towards the hard wall at @xmath59 .",
    "it is natural to ask what happens when the @xmath21 lm trajectories actually reach @xmath59 .",
    "there are two reasonable interpretations .",
    "the first is that the trajectories keep moving uniformly into the @xmath60 region of configuration space .",
    "this approach treats the hard wall system as if it were the free particle system , but with the @xmath60 region effectively ignored.@xcite this underscores the fact that unlike @xmath16 itself , the individual @xmath17 components _ per se _ are unconstrained at the origin  though the constraint implies a unique correspondence between the two .",
    "this interpretation also makes it clear that for the hard wall system , the paper i decomposition is essentially identical to the present decomposition , as is worked out in detail in the appendix .    in the second interpretation ,",
    "the effect of the hard wall at @xmath59 is to cause instantaneous elastic reflection of a @xmath21 lm trajectory momentum , from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "afterwards , the reflected trajectory propagates uniformly backward , along the @xmath22 lm . in this interpretation",
    ", the trajectories never leave the allowed configuration space , @xmath54 .",
    "however , wavepacket reflection is essentially achieved via trajectory _ hopping _ from one lm to the other  not unlike that previously considered , e.g. , in the context of non - adiabatic transitions.@xcite the trajectory hopping interpretation is adopted in the present paper , and in paper iii , but the first interpretation will also be reconsidered in later publications . note that for discontinuous potentials  and indeed more generally@xcite  one can regard trajectory hopping as the _ source _ of @xmath17 interaction coupling .",
    "for the hard wall case , trajectory hopping only manifests at @xmath59 , the sink of all @xmath21 lm trajectories , and the source of all @xmath22 lm trajectories .",
    "if these trajectories are to be regarded as one and the same via hopping , then a unique field transformation for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and all spatial derivatives , must be specified .",
    "fortunately , the unique correspondence between @xmath21 and @xmath22 described above , enables one to do just that .",
    "in particular , specifies the correct transformations for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as transported by the quantum trajectories .",
    "all spatial derivatives of arbitrary orders can then be obtained via spatial differentiation of although in the hard wall case , only the @xmath65 condition , @xmath66 is relevant , because all higher order derivatives are identically zero .",
    "since the magnitudes of the @xmath67 and @xmath63 fields associated with a given quantum trajectory are unchanged as a result of the trajectory hop , implies that the incident and reflected flux values are the same ( apart from sign ) , and so the scattering system exhibits 100% reflection and zero transmission ( along each lm , the flux is invariant@xcite ) .",
    "these basic facts of the hard wall system are of course well understood .",
    "the point , though , is that we have now obtained the information in a time-_dependent _ quantum trajectory manner , rather than through the usual route of applying boundary conditions to time-_independent _ piecewise component functions . in other words , now refers to individual _",
    "quantum trajectories _",
    ", rather than to wavefunctions .",
    "this shift of emphasis is very important , and leads to quite a number of conceptual and computational advantages .",
    "for instance , the standard description of the hard wall stationary states would decompose these into plane wave components interpreted as `` incident '' and `` reflected '' waves .",
    "this language suggests a process , or change over time ",
    "a state that is initially incident , at some later time is somehow transformed into a reflected state .",
    "nothing in the standard description , however , would seem to render transparent the usage of such terminology , i.e. @xmath16 is stationary , and so the reflected and transmitted components are in fact _ both _",
    "present for all times .",
    "of course , a localized superposition of stationary states , i.e. a wavepacket , may well exhibit such an explicit transformation over the course of the time evolution , as such a state is decidedly non - stationary .",
    "indeed , wavepackets are relied upon by the more rigorous formulations of scattering theory , in order to justify the use of terms such as `` reflected wave , '' even in a stationary context.@xcite such formulations , though certainly legitimate , seem always to require a clever use of limits , the subtle distinction between unitary and isometric transformations , and other esoteric mathematical tricks .    on the other hand ,",
    "the time - dependent bipolar quantum trajectory hopping picture presented above provides a physicality to such language that is immediately apparent . over the course of the time evolution , although the wavefunction as a whole is stationary , each individual _ trajectory _ is first incident from the left , then collides with the hard wall , and is subsequently reflected back towards the left ( i.e. towards @xmath27 ) .",
    "the bipolar quantum trajectories are all classical , as the bipolar quantum potentials , @xmath32 , are zero everywhere except at the wall itself .",
    "interference arises naturally from the superposition of the two lms  i.e .",
    ", from the trajectories that have already progressed to the point of reflecting , vs. those that have not reflected yet .",
    "in contrast , since @xmath16 itself exhibits very substantial interference , and an infinite number of nodes , the traditional unipolar qtm treatment would be very ill - behaved , i.e. @xmath68 would oscillate wildly in the large @xmath69 limit , and @xmath70 would be numerically unstable near the nodes . apart from these important pragmatic drawbacks , the incident / reflected interpretation of the quantum trajectories would also be lost .",
    "the bipolar quantum trajectory description of the hard wall system is very reminiscent of ray optics , as used to describe the reflection of electromagnetic waves off of a perfectly reflecting surface.@xcite indeed , much can be gained from applying a ray optics analogy to quantum scattering applications , especially where discontinuous potentials are concerned .",
    "one can construct a simple gedankenexperiment as follows .",
    "let @xmath71 denote some effective left edge of the system , well to the left of the interaction region . at some initial time",
    "@xmath72 , all trajectories on the positive lm lying to the right of @xmath73 are _ ignored _ , as is the negative lm altogether .",
    "one then evolves the retained trajectories over time , and monitors the contribution that just these trajectories make to the total wavefunction . in some respects ,",
    "it is as if the point @xmath73 were serving as the initial wavefront for some incoming wave , that at @xmath72 had not yet reached the hard wall / reflecting surface . of course , if the actual wave were in fact truncated in this fashion , then the discontinuity in the field functions at the wavefront would result in a very non - trivial propagation over time , owing to the high - frequency components implicitly present . for actual waves , the precise nature of the wavefront",
    "is known to have a tremendous impact on the resultant dynamics.@xcite we avoid such complicating details by always interpreting the `` actual wave '' to be the full stationary wave itself , i.e. the truncation is conceptual only .    in the ray optics analogy ,",
    "the above situation is like a source of light located at @xmath73 , which is suddenly `` turned on '' at @xmath72 .",
    "it takes time for the wavefront to propagate to the reflecting surface , and additional time for the reflected wavefront to make its way back to @xmath74 .",
    "prior to the latter point in time , the evolution of the truncated electromagnetic wave is decidedly _",
    "non_-stationary ; afterwards however , a stationary wave is achieved , at least within the region of interest , @xmath75 , as the wavefront has by this stage propagated beyond this region .",
    "the same qualitative comments apply to the bipolar quantum case , although of course the evolution equations are different .    a similar prescription",
    "may be used to achieve rudimentary `` wavepacket dynamics , '' even in the context of purely stationary states . instead of retaining _ all _ initial trajectories that lie to the left of @xmath73 , one retains only those that lie within some finite interval .",
    "the resulting time evolution is analogous to a light source that is turned on at @xmath72 , and then turned off at some later time ( prior to when the wavefront arrives at the reflecting surface ) .",
    "the initial `` wavepacket '' has uniform density , and moves with uniform speed towards the hard wall .",
    "interference fringes then form after the foremost trajectories have been reflected onto the negative lm .",
    "eventually , all trajectories within the interval are reflected , at which point interference ceases ( the nodes are `` healed''@xcite ) , uniform density is restored , and the reflected wave travels with uniform speed in the reverse direction , back towards the starting point @xmath73 .",
    "qualitatively , this behavior is clearly similar to that undergone by actual wavepackets reflecting off of barrier potentials .",
    "the ideas described above can be easily extended to more complicated discontinuous potential systems , such as up- and down - step potentials , and any combination of multiple steps , e.g. square barriers and square wells . in paper iii",

    ", there is no tunneling for this system , but in other respects it resembles the square barrier . from an optics point of view",
    ", the square well corresponds to a central medium with larger index of refraction than its surroundings , whereas the square barrier corresponds to a smaller index of refraction , giving rise to the possibility of total internal reflection ( i.e. tunneling ) .",

    ", @xmath225 a.u . , and @xmath226 a.u .",
    "as the time evolution and trajectory pictures are similar to those of the previous sections , we focus only on the @xmath96 and @xmath97 calculations , for which once again , a large range of energies was considered ( @xmath227 hartree ) .",

    "this is true despite the fact that the square well energy curves are decidedly more oscillatory than the square barrier curves  particularly for wide barriers , for which the @xmath18 dependence is very sensitive indeed .",
    "one particularly important feature exhibited by the exact curves is the so - called ramsauer - townsend effect,@xcite i.e. the phenomenon of 100% transmission and zero reflection , even at very low energies .",
    "this occurs when @xmath228 , and may be regarded as a purely quantum mechanical resonance phenomenon . yet it is reproduced perfectly here in the bipolar decomposition , using _",
    "classical trajectories_. indeed , the bipolar picture provides an interesting physical explanation , i.e. the right - incident and left - incident waves of the first step give rise to spawned contributions to @xmath199 that exactly cancel each other out via destructive interference .",
    "as described in paper  i , the  equation is linear , yet the equivalent qhem  obtained via substitution of the madelung - bohm ansatz into the  equation  are not .",
    "this aspect of bohmian mechanics suggests that it can be beneficial , both from a pedagogical and a computational perspective , to apply a suitable bifurcation ( or `` multifurcation '' ) to the wavefunction prior to applying the qhem .",
    "indeed , following the paper  i cpwm bipolar decomposition for 1d stationary bound states,@xcite the quantum trajectories become more well - behaved and classical - like , in precisely the limit in which there are more nodes , and the usual unipolar calculation breaks down .",
    "moreover , the resultant component lms admit a natural physical interpretation in terms of the corresponding semiclassical lms .    in the generalization to the stationary scattering states considered here , a somewhat different bipolar decomposition is found to be required .",
    "the new decomposition is still unique , at least for discontinuous potentials .",
    "however , the resultant components @xmath17 are no longer solutions to the  equation in their own right , as a result of which their time evolution is coupled . the new scheme ",
    "though fundamentally different from the old one  nevertheless bears a correspondence to a modified version of semiclassical theory appropriate for scattering systems .",
    "curiously , this semiclassical modification is _ not _ simply a higher order treatment in @xmath229;@xcite if it were , the corresponding exact quantum modification considered here would not exist .    in any event , the new decomposition also gives rise to its own physical interpretation , specific to the scattering context .",
    "in particular , for right - incident boundary conditions , the left and right asymptotes of @xmath21 respectively represent incident and transmitted waves , whereas the left asymptote of @xmath22 represents the reflected wave [ the right asymptote of @xmath22 approaches zero ] .",
    "that these conceptually useful asymptotic bipolar assignments  found even in the most elementary treatments of scattering  may be extended _ throughout configuration space _ [ even for continuous potentials ( paper  iii ) ] represents an important leap forward , especially for qtms .",
    "another pedagogically and numerically useful development from this approach is the inherently time - dependent ray optics interpretation that naturally arises , particularly in the discontinuous potential context .",
    "the ray optics approach is anticipated to be a relevant guiding force in subsequent generalizations of the present methodology , i.e. to continuous , multidimensional potential systems , and  as per the discussion in secs .",
    "[ hardwall ] and  [ stepabove]for non - stationary wavepacket dynamics .",
    "this approach also provides a much simpler trajectory - based explanation of scattering terminology as applied in a stationary context ",

    "these are the first discontinuous applications of a genuine qtm calculation that have ever been performed , to the authors knowledge .",
    "the singular derivatives associated with discontinuous potential functions would wreak havoc with standard numerical differentiation routines .",
    "second , the use of a time-_dependent _ method for stationary , or time-_independent _ , applications , is also significant .",
    "ordinarily , the time dependence of stationary states is regarded as trivial . in the present context , this is true in a sense for the hard wall and step potential systems , because the correct answer is `` built in '' the method itself . for multiple step systems , however , the dynamical truncated wave approach , i.e. the gedankenexperiment introduced in sec .",
    "[ hardwall ] and further developed in later sections , yields decidedly nontrivial results .",
    "in particular , the algorithm uses only _ single step _ scattering coefficients to obtain global scattering quantities for _ multiple step _ systems . in effect , the time dependent nature of this approach allows computation of _ global _ properties using a completely _ local _ method . not only were exact quantum results obtained for a full range of system parameters , but the numerical resources necessary to achieve this ",
    "the number of trajectories and time steps  were decidedly minimal .",
    "indeed , the algorithm lives up to the promise made in paper  i , of performing an accurate quantum calculation with _ fewer trajectories than nodes_a prospect virtually unheard of in a unipolar context .    in future publications , we will naturally attempt to generalize the methodology described here and in paper  iii , for the type of multidimensional time - dependent wavepacket dynamics relevant to chemical physics applications . in this context",
    ", the scattering version of the cpwm decomposition developed here is an absolutely essential first step , as reactive scattering is the underpinning of all chemical reactions .",
    "additional discussion and motivation will be provided in paper  iii .",

    "as discussed in secs .  [ scattering ] , [ hardwall ] , and  [ stepbelow ] , semi - bound stationary states in 1d are bounded on one side only , as a result of which they are real - valued and singly - degenerate , like bound states .",

    "this is the only region of interest for the hard wall system ; however , for finite @xmath89 values  i.e . for general below - barrier up - step stationary states",

    "note that the quantum potential in this region is not zero ; indeed , it exhibits a discontinuity at @xmath59 that exactly balances that of @xmath13 itself , so that the bipolar modified potential is continuous across the step . unlike the above - barrier case , the paper  i solution does _ not _ manifest oscillatory behavior in the large action limit , and so this approach would at first glance appear to be ideal .",
