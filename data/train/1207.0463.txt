    "we consider the asymptotics of polynomial sequences @xmath0 defined by orthogonality relations with respect to a discrete measure @xmath1 ( with finite moments ) @xmath2 which is a linear combination of dirac measures at the points @xmath3 .",
    "by @xmath4 we denotes the set of all nonnegative integers .",
    "the asymptotic theory of orthogonal polynomials with respect to discrete measures is not so widely developed as for absolutely continues measures of orthogonality .",
    "it can be explained because the distribution of zeros of the polynomials orthogonal with respect to a discrete measure has an extra constrain .",
    "indeed ( it follows from the interlacing property of orthogonal polynomials ) , between two neighboring mass points of the measure of orthogonality it can not be situated more than one zero of the orthogonal polynomials .",
    "this constrain plays an important role in the logarithmic potential description of the limiting measure of zeros distribution and of the main term of asymptotics .",
    "logarithmic potential @xmath5 for probability measure @xmath6 ( _ zero counting measure _ ) , equally distributed in the zeros of polynomial @xmath7 , is @xmath8 thus , the potential of a limiting ( when @xmath9 ) zero distribution measure @xmath10 defines an _ exponent of the main term _ of the polynomial sequence @xmath0 asymptotics . such type of asymptotics are also called _ weak asymptotics_. for the description of this limiting measure it is useful to formulate a minimization problem for the energy of the logarithmic potential .",
    "it is clear , that constrain of the zero counting measure ( which we pointed out above ) leads to a problem of energy minimization in the class of probabilistic measures constrained by the weak limit of the mass points counting measure . for discrete orthogonal polynomials",
    "this approach was suggested by rakhmanov in @xcite .",
    "this approach was later extended in @xcite ( for more details on the topic we refer to monographs @xcite and @xcite for extremal and equilibrium problem of logarithmic potential with application to the weak asymptotics of polynomials sequences as well as to monograph @xcite for discrete orthogonality and constrained equilibrium ) .",
    "the content of this paper starts with the study of weak asymptotics for monic polynomial sequences defined by discrete measure .",
    "in particular , we focus our attention in a polynomial sequence orthogonal with respect to negative binomial distribution ( pascal distribution ) on @xmath4 , i.e @xmath11 this orthogonal polynomial sequence ( denoted by @xmath12 ) is called _ classical meixner polynomials _",
    "they satisfy the orthogonality conditions @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , is the pochhammer symbol . however , our main goal is the asymptotic analysis of _ multiple meixner polynomials _ , which constitute a generalization of the aforementioned meixner polynomials .",
    "for these polynomials the orthogonality conditions are considered with respect to a collection of meixner weights with different parameters @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the study of these polynomials ( among others classical discrete multiple orthogonal polynomials ) was initiated in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next subsection  [ ss1.1 ] is devoted to the notion of multiple orthogonal polynomials ( definition and some properties ) . in subsection  [ recursiemeervoudige ]",
    "we give general information about recurrence relations for multiple orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the introduction finishes with two subsections devoted to some formal properties of the multiple meixner orthogonal polynomials obtained in @xcite .",
    "recall that there are two kind of multiple meixner orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the first kind corresponds ( see subsection  [ mmvb1 ] ) to simultaneous orthogonality conditions with respect to discrete weights formed by with various @xmath19 .",
    "the second kind polynomials ( see subsection  [ mmvb2 ] ) appear when the collection of discrete weights is formed by with various @xmath20 .",
    "the explicit expressions for the coefficients of the recurrence relations of the multiple meixner orthogonal polynomials are the main outcome from these subsections  [ mmvb1 ] and  [ mmvb2 ] -used in the sequel .    in section  [ equil - alg ] we state the logarithmic potential equilibrium problems for the description of weak asymptotics of meixner and multiple meixner polynomials and the solutions of these problems by means of certain algebraic functions are found .",
    "the procedure for solving such type of equilibrium problems is inspired in @xcite ( see also earlier references therein ) .",
    "lastly , in section  [ nroot ] we , starting from the coefficient of the recurrence relations , obtain the main term of asymptotics of multiple meixner polynomials and then we check the connection of this term with the equilibrium problem from the previous section .",
    "theorems  [ t3 ] and  [ t3.2 ] are the main results of the paper .",
    "furthermore , the spectral curves for the multiple meixner orthogonal polynomials ( of the first and second kind ) and their connection with recurrence relations and vector potential equilibrium with external field and constrain constitute the main outcome of the present paper .",
    "finally , we should also mention paper @xcite by sorokin in which the weak asymptotics of multiple meixner orthogonal polynomials of the second type were studied , but using another approach where the integral representation for the polynomials and saddle point method were applied .      below we summarize some results needed for the sequel .",

    "this assumption allows us heuristically to state an ad hoc vector equilibrium problem with nikishin matrix of interaction , with external field ( because of unbounded set of orthogonality ) and constrain ( due to discrete weight ) .",
    "accordingly , at this stage we look for the solutions of this equilibrium problem in a form of spectral curve ( among the simplest candidates satisfying the necessary conditions following from the equilibrium problem ) .",
    "thus , as a result of the first stage of our analysis we have heuristically got equations of the algebraic curves and and have related their logarithms ( rigorously ) with certain vector equilibrium problems ( see propositions  [ prop:2.1 ] and [ prop:2.2 ] ) .",
    "we highlight that at this point spectral curves and equilibrium problems are not formally related to the multiple meixner orthogonal polynomials .    in section  [ nroot ]",
    "we derive the same spectral curves from the recurrence coefficients of the multiple meixner orthogonal polynomials .",
    "consequently , it now rigorously relates nikishin type equilibrium with constrains to meixner discrete orthogonality .",
    "it this subsection , aimed to illustrate our approach in connection with the above discussed techniques , we take ( as example ) the classical meixner polynomials  .",
    "first , we state the equilibrium problem for the limiting zero counting measure .",
    "then , we show our approach , which is based on an algebraic function formulation , by solving this equilibrium problem in a quite direct way .",

    "indeed , it is orthogonal to @xmath222 with respect to the varying weight ( depending on @xmath69 ) @xmath223 concentrated in the points @xmath224 . taking the limit @xmath225 we see that the external field for extremal problem  and equilibrium problem has the follownig form @xmath226 we also have @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the lebesgue measure with unit density @xmath229 on the semiaxis @xmath230 .",

    "let us show our approach for finding the explicit representation of the measure @xmath231 .",
    "we look for the cauchy transform of measure @xmath10 ( or markov function ) @xmath234 as function @xmath235 , which be analytic on some two sheeted riemann surface @xmath236 .",
    "the possibility of analytic continuation of the function @xmath235 to another sheet of the riemann surface through the compact @xmath156 can be seen from the second relation in after it  complexification \" and differentiation .",

    "moreover , it is clear from electrostatic consideration of the problem  that at the neighborhood of the left end point of @xmath247 , i.e. to the right from the origin , this jump has to be a constant -here the measure @xmath10 reaches its constrain by the lebesgue measure @xmath228 .",
    "such behavior can be modelled by representing the function @xmath235 as logarithm of some other function , say @xmath248 , which on this part of the support of the measure @xmath10 ( i.e. in the saturation zone ) takes negative real values .",

    "measure @xmath10 obtained by this procedure satisfies the equilibrium condition .",
    "furthermore , after integration one can obtain an explicit value of the equilibrium constant in @xmath260      assume @xmath82 , and @xmath261 .",
    "we rewrite weights ( [ weights - kind-1 ] ) as follows @xmath262 here the supports of both discrete orthogonality measures coincide .",
    "therefore , we pose an equilibrium problem for the weak asymptotics in a similar way to the nikishin case .",
    "indeed , we consider the equilibrium problem associated with the weights @xmath263 , and @xmath264 , where @xmath265 the integral representation in the right hand side is due to the cauchy integral formula with a contour of integration @xmath266 encircling @xmath230 , i.e. it comes from infinity through the upper half plane along the positive semiaxis turning counterclockwise around zero in the left half plane and returning to infinity along the positive semiaxis through the lower half plane . in addition , the contour @xmath266 serves as a boundary of holomorphicity region of an analog of the function .",
    "now we do a scaling of the problem in order to compactify zeros of multiple meixner polynomials ( first kind ) .",
