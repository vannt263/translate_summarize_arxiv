    "ounterfactual  measurements \" yield values that have been derived by means other than direct observation or actual measurement , such as by calculation on the basis of a well - substantiated theory .",
    "if one knows an equation that permits deriving reliably expected values from a list of inputs to the physical system under investigation , then one has `` counterfactual definiteness '' ( cfd ) in the knowledge of that system . for an extensive discussion of counterfactuals",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the derivation of the theorem of bell and bell s inequality necessitate the postulate of counterfactual definiteness  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we adopt the definition of cfd as given in our earlier paper  @xcite :    in brief , cfd means that the output state of a system can , in principle , be calculated using an explicit formula , e.g. @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a known ( vector - valued ) function of its argument @xmath2 . if @xmath2 denotes a vector of values then , according to the above definition , the elements of this vector must be independent variables for the mathematical model to be cfd - compliant .",
    "although it is clear that cfd can not be tested in a conventional laboratory experiment  @xcite , a digital computer is nothing but a physical device that performs a kind of experiment ( e.g. flipping bits ) , albeit one that is under perfect control ( we assume that the computer is operating flawless ) .",
    "therefore a digital computer may be used as a metaphor for carrying out ideal , perfect experiments . in particular , it is trivial to perform computer experiments using functions that satisfy the criterion of a cfd theory . with all this in mind , in the present paper",
    "we only consider formulas @xmath0 that can be implemented as an algorithm running on a digital computer . using the digital computer as a metaphor guarantees that we have a well - defined precise ( in terms of bits ) representation of the concepts and algorithms ( also in terms of bits ) involved .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to scrutinize the relation and relevance of cfd to models of einstein - podolsky - rosen - bohm ( eprb ) experiments .",
    "we demonstrate that there exist both cfd and non - cfd - compliant computer models for the eprb experiments that produce results in complete agreement with those of quantum theory . because these computer models do not contain quantum concepts",
    ", cfd does not distinguish classical from quantum physics for the case of eprb experiments .",
    "in this section we describe a loophole - free implementation of bohm s version  @xcite of the einstein - podolsky - rosen thought experiments  @xcite .",
    "this implementation simulates laboratory ( eprb ) experiments with photons  @xcite but does not suffer from the practical limitations of real experiments : the computer experiments that we report upon are ideal , perfect , loophole free experiments .",
    "the computational model of the eprb experiment is constructed such that it can reproduce , _ exactly _ , the single particle averages and two - particle correlations of the singlet state  @xcite .",
    "we begin by specifying the model of the observation stations which are considered to be identical computational units which operate according to a specific algorithm , see fig .  1 .",
    "input to a unit is the setting @xmath3 ( representing the angle of the polarizer ) , an angle @xmath4 ( representing the polarization of the photon ) , and a number @xmath5 .",
    "output of a given unit is a binary variable @xmath6 ( representing the detection event at one of the two detectors placed behind the polarizer ) , and a time - related parameter @xmath7 ( related to the recorded time - tag ) .",
    "the model parameter @xmath8 is fixed and does not depend on the setting @xmath3 .    upon receiving the input @xmath9 the unit executes the following two steps  @xcite :    @xmath10\\;,\\ ; s=\\sin[2(a-\\phi ) ] , \\label{cfd0a } \\\\ & 2.&\\mathrm{set\\ \\ \\ } x={\\mathop{\\mathrm{sign}}}(c ) \\;,\\ ; t^*=rts^2 . \\label{cfd0b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these two lines form the core of the computer algorithm . the simplicity of this algorithm is enticing , however , it contains several key features .",
    "one is the creation of a time - related variable @xmath11 that has the interesting property of being a function of both the local setting @xmath3 and the angle @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to bell and clauser - horn - shimony - holt , we are dealing therefore , with time related parameters that depend on the local setting of each station .",
    "in addition , the model introduces randomness by a number @xmath13 , distributed uniformly .",
    "it is important to notice that the variable @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ cfd0b ] ) may be imagined as being related to a  pointer - position \" of a clock that symbolizes dynamic many - body interactions of the photon with the constituent particles of the source and local measurement equipment ( polarizers etc . ) .",
    "all of these particles perform a ( relativistic ) many - body  dance \" that certainly may depend on the local equipment orientation as well as on properties of the incoming photons . because this many body ",
    "dance \" has never been explored in actual eprb equipments , we consider @xmath11 in the following only as a computer generated time - related tag that is used in order to deal selectively with the results for @xmath2 after the whole computer experiment is done .    for every input event @xmath9 , we know the values of all outputs variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the input - output relation of this unit , represented by the diagram of fig .  1 , satisfies the requirement of cfd .",
    "we also use below the somewhat simpler notation @xmath16 and @xmath17 , keeping in mind that the @xmath2 s depend on @xmath12 and the @xmath11 s depend on both @xmath12 and @xmath18 . here and in the following",

    "the procedure for generating the @xmath12 s is specified in section `` computer simulation results '' .",
    "the computational equivalent of the eprb experiment  @xcite is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we start by assuming that the source @xmath19 and the observation stations @xmath20 are equipped with idealized , perfect clocks ( not shown ) that have been synchronized before the source is being activated . each time the source @xmath19 is activated , two photons",
    "are sent in opposite directions .",
    "the source is activated at times @xmath21 and denote the minimum time interval between two emission events by @xmath22 .",
    "each photon traveling to observation station @xmath20 carries its data in the form of an angle @xmath23 ( representing the polarization ) and a pseudo - random number @xmath24 .",

    "the restriction @xmath37 implies that @xmath38 and this inequality has an important consequence because it guarantees that there is a one to one correspondence between the value of the time - tag @xmath32 and the number @xmath27 of the emission event .",

    "we have @xmath39 and therefore , in the computer model , the time - of - flight and photon emission times @xmath21 are superfluous and may be omitted .",
    "there is no coincidence loophole and as every photon arriving at an observation station also produces an output event @xmath40 , there is no detection loophole either .",

    "the computer models that we use are metaphors for einstein - local experiments : changing @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) never has an effect on the values of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) or @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , not in the past nor in the future , hence the output of one particular unit depends on the input to that particular unit only .",
    "the crucial point that leads to a violation of bell s theorem is now the following .",
    "we deal with photon pairs for which an  entanglement \" is defined in the hilbert space of quantum mechanics .",
    "the correlations of the event of measurement of these pairs are , on the other hand , obtained by measurements in ordinary space and time . in other words , some criterion is employed to relate the measured pairs and identify them as belonging together",
    ". such identification can be achieved , among other possibilities , by use of two synchronized clocks indicating time @xmath54 in both measurement stations .",

    "this joint frequency distribution is derived in an einstein local way and depends on the settings of the polarizers of * both * stations , a fact that can not be accommodated in bell - type proofs .",
    "bell - chsh inequality tests require four different experiments with different choices of the settings of the observation stations .",
    "specifically , the setting of observation station @xmath20 can take two values which we denote by @xmath61 .",
    "the choice of setting @xmath62 or @xmath63 may be made at random  @xcite . in real experiments",
    ", it takes a certain time to switch from one setting to another but this time is less than the average time between two emission events  @xcite . in the computer experiment , being an idealized perfect experiment , the algorithm is such that this can not be an issue .    the algorithm represented by fig .",
    "2 is cfd - compliant .",
    "however , the computational model represented by the diagram in fig .  2 * can not * compute , e.g. @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 in a cfd - compliant manner : it suffers from the so - called contextuality loophole  @xcite because there is no guarantee that the random @xmath23 s used to compute the @xmath67 s will be the same as the random @xmath23 s used for the calculation of the @xmath68 s .",
    "under these circumstances the correlations calculated from the data generated by the model shown in fig .  2 do not need to satisfy a bell - type inequality  @xcite and , as demonstrated explicitly below through simulation , indeed they do not .",
    "thus , the model of fig .  2",
    "* can not * be used to perform a cfd - compliant simulation of the eprb experiment .",
    "the layout of a cfd - compliant computer model of the eprb experiment is depicted in fig .",
    "it uses the same units as the non - cfd - compliant model shown in fig .  2 , the only difference being that the input @xmath69 is now fed into an observation station with setting @xmath62 and another one with setting @xmath63 . as each of the four units operates according to the rules given by eq .  ( [ cfd0a ] ) and ( [ cfd0b ] )",

    "3 satisfies , by construction , the criterion of a cfd theory .",
    "as cfd is used as at least one of the assumptions to prove the bell - chsh inequality  @xcite , it is instructive to see how this feature appears in the computational model . therefore , let us start by explicitly ignoring the @xmath54-variables . as is clear from fig .  3 , the two stations on the left of the source * s * receive the same data @xmath73 from the source .",
    "the settings @xmath48 and @xmath74 are fixed for the duration of the @xmath75 repetitions of the experiment .",
    "the same holds for the two stations at the right of the source , with subscript 1 replaced by 2 .",
    "clearly , each quadruple of output data @xmath76 is generated in a cfd - compliant manner .",
    "for each input event ( labeled by @xmath77 ) we compute @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath75 denotes the number of pairs that was processed by the units . from eq .",
    "( [ cfd1a ] ) it follows immediately that @xmath80 and hence @xmath81 .",
    "of course , this is what we expect : if the whole system is cfd - compliant and we ignore the @xmath54-variables , we generate quadruples and then it is impossible to violate the bell - chsh inequality @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "next , we examine what happens if the time - tag variables @xmath32 are included . in real eprb experiments with photons , it is essential to use time - coincidence to identify pairs  @xcite . the standard procedure adopted in these experiments is to introduce a time window @xmath59 and reject pairs that do not satisfy the condition @xmath83 ( and similar for other relevant combinations of @xmath8 s )  @xcite . the computational model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ cfd0a ] ) and ( [ cfd0b ] ) together with the time - coincidence criterion yields , in the limit that the time - window @xmath59 vanishes , the correlation of the singlet state  @xcite if we repeat the experiment pair - wise , i.e. with four pairs of settings ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , in which case the cfd criterion is clearly not satisfied . we emphasize that unlike in the laboratory experiment , in the computer experiment all pairs are created `` on demand '' , each pair is detected , and the time window only serves as a vehicle to post select pairs , not to identify them .",
    "post - selection only serves to `` probe '' the complicated , time - dependent many - body physics that is involved when the photon passes through the optical system and triggers the detector . in this sense ,",
    "the computer experiment suffers from none of the loopholes that may occur in experiments .",
    "although not feasible with photons , using the computer as a metaphor we can perform the ideal , loophole - free experiment satisfying all the requirements of a cfd theory .",
    "in the remainder of this section we discuss the ramifications to the bell - type inequality that ensue when time is included in the description . in the next section ,",
    "we demonstrate that the cfd - compliant model reproduces the quantum theoretical results of the singlet state .",
    "we formalize the effect of the time - coincidence window by introducing the binary variables @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the unit step function .",
    "in essence , we extend the computational device by taking the output of the two units described earlier and feeding the time - tag output in a `` correlator '' that computes , for each event @xmath27 , the four binary variables defined by eq .",
    "( [ cfd2 ] ) . adding",
    "the correlator does not change the fact that the computer model is cfd - compliant .",
    "indeed , a given input @xmath86 together with the settings @xmath87 completely determines the values of all ( two - valued ) output variables @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "note that e.g. @xmath96 means that the particular pair has been discarded by the time - coincidence criterion for the pair of settings @xmath47 but that this does not imply that e.g. @xmath97 .",
    "in other words , the values of the @xmath98 s are used to post - select pairs .",
    "next we compute averages and correlations of the coincident pairs as is done in laboratory eprb experiments  @xcite .",
    "the single-@xmath2 averages and correlation for the settings @xmath47 are defined by @xmath99 and we have similar expressions for the other choices of settings . in eq .",
    "( [ cfd3 ] ) it is understood that @xmath100 means @xmath101",
    ", i.e. the sum over all input events , characterized by values of the @xmath18 s and @xmath12 s .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath102 , @xmath103 etc .",
    "are zero , up to fluctuations .",
    "the reason is that @xmath104 changes the sign of the @xmath2 s but has no effect on the values of the @xmath11 s ( see eq .",
    "( [ cfd0b ] ) ) . therefore ,",
    "if the @xmath105 uniformly cover @xmath106 , the number of times @xmath107 and @xmath108 appear is about the same .",
    "the usual strategy of deriving a bell - like inequality for @xmath109 does not work simply because not all @xmath98 s need to be one for the same event @xmath27  @xcite but we can , without using probability theory , derive another inequality by following the strategy of larsson and gill  @xcite . denoting the number of input events for which the four pairs of setting simultaneously satisfy the coincidence criterion by @xmath110 and the maximum number of pairs per setting that satisfies the coincidence criterion by @xmath111",
    ", we have @xmath112 and it is straightforward to show ( by repeated application of the triangle inequality ) that the following statement holds : in the case that the time - coincidence criterion is used to post - select pairs , the correlations can not violate the inequality @xmath113 therefore , if the algorithm generates all the variables strictly in accordance with the criterion of a cfd theory , using the time - coincidence window to post - select pairs does not lead to the bell - chsh inequality unless @xmath114 in which case all @xmath98 s are equal to one and none of the pairs are discarded by the post - selection procedure . the term @xmath115 in eq .",

    "( [ cfd11 ] ) holds .",
    "as explained earlier , from the logical structure of the algorithm it is evident that the outcome of a particular unit can not be influenced by the input / output of another unit , not by the current input event nor by past or future events .",
    "therefore , all models that we consider generate data by a process that complies with the notion of einstein locality .",
    "we present the results of four different modes of simulating the eprb experiments .",
    "this section reports the results of simulations for 100 repetitions of the eprb experiment with @xmath117 events per pair of settings in the case of the non - cfd - compliant models and @xmath118 events for the cfd - compliant models .",
    "we set @xmath119 and @xmath120 where @xmath4 is a uniform pseudo - random number , corresponding to the case in which the polarizations of the two photons within a pair are orthogonal and fully correlated ( if @xmath121 and @xmath122 are uncorrelated and random , the average of the @xmath2 s and the average of e.g. @xmath123 are all zero , independent of the settings ) .",
