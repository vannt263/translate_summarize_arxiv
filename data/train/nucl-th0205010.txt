    "present knowledge of the structure of hadrons and nuclei mainly comes from electroweak form factors , in elastic and transition regimes , and from deep - inelastic structure functions . to perform a meaningful comparison between theoretical models and the experimental data",
    ", one needs a description of the bound system of interacting constituents and a consistent current operator . within a hamiltonian approach",
    ", the state of the system is defined on a specified hypersurface of the space - time that does not contain timelike directions .",
    "dirac identified three space - time hypersurfaces , adequate to define the state of a relativistic system , which correspond to different forms of relativistic hamiltonian dynamics , namely the instant form , the front form and the point form @xcite .    in the front - form dynamics , the consistency between the current operator and the state of the hadron system has been discussed both from a field theoretical point of view and within approaches with a fixed number of particles . in field theory",
    ", the state has an infinite number of components in the fock space@xcite .",
    "however , for practical applications only the lowest fock component , or valence component , is usually modeled and used in the calculations of electroweak form factors . in principle , the infinite set of coupled eigenvalue equations for the hamiltonian operator in the fock space can be replaced by an effective squared mass operator acting in the valence sector ; at the same time , it is possible to express systematically the higher fock - state components of the wave function as functionals of the lower ones @xcite .",
    "the effective electroweak current operator to be used with the valence component of the state can be consistently derived within the framework of the bethe - salpeter equation projected at equal light - front time , as recently shown in refs.@xcite .",
    "( for recentinvestigation on other aspects of the bethe - salpeter equation within the light front , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if a fixed number of interacting particles is assumed , then a front - form hamiltonian dynamics ( ffhd ) can be developed .",
    "one can use the bakamjian - thomas construction@xcite , where an effective interaction in the mass operator can be chosen such that a unitary representation of the poincar group is possible .",
    "taking the front - form spin operator as the free one and an interaction in the mass operator that commutes with such a spin operator , one is able to explicitly construct generators of the poincar group@xcite . in this case , the eigenfunctions of the mass operator are normalized to one , differently from the field theoretical valence component , which has in general a probability less than one@xcite .",
    "a wide number of papers have been devoted to the evaluation of properties of hadrons and nuclei within the front - form hamiltonian dynamics with a finite number of particles ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , just to give a short account of some previous works ) .",
    "in particular , it should be noted that ffhd for the two - nucleon case yields the possibility to retain the large amount of successful phenomenology developed within a nonrelativistic approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "usually , to obtain electroweak form factors of nuclear systems or hadrons , the drell - yan condition on the momentum transfer , i.e. @xmath5 , and the matrix elements of the plus component of the current , @xmath6 , are adopted .",
    "the physical argument often advocated in favour of these assumptions is that the production of pairs from the incoming photon ( nonvalence or pair - term contribution ) is suppressed in the drell - yan frame by light - front momentum conservation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this was indeed proved in schematic covariant field theoretical models , for spin - zero two - boson composite systems@xcite and for the pion with pseudo - scalar coupling to the quarks@xcite .",
    "however , for spin - one systems the pair term survives and contributes to @xmath6 in the drell - yan frame @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this case the pair term is necessary to keep the rotational invariance of the form factors for spin - one particles . within ffhd , in the drell - yan frame , the matrix elements of the plus component of the current should fulfill the so called angular condition @xcite .",
    "this constraint is not satisfied by a calculation considering only the front - form wave function and the impulse approximation .",
    "this approximation implies an ambiguity in extracting form factors for spin - one systems , as shown for the deuteron@xcite and for the rho - meson @xcite . to solve this problem , related to the lacking of covariance for the impulse approximation current operator ,",
    "some physically inspired combinations of matrix elements were proposed to extract form factors from the current , as the `` good - component '' approach@xcite or the elimination of spurious contributions to the form factors@xcite .    to avoid the difficulties associated with these ambiguities , another approach was proposed in ref.@xcite and applied to the deuteron@xcite . in these works , it was shown that a current operator which satisfies the requirements of poincar , parity and time - reversal covariance , as well as hermiticity and current conservation , can be obtained from a one - body operator in the breit frame with momentum transfer along the z - direction .",
    "then , for any hadron system the electromagnetic form factors can be calculated from the wave function without ambiguities .    this major development in the calculation of the form factors from the front - form wave function is ,",
    "however , confronted with the fact that , even in simple field - theoretical models , the pair production mechanism contributes in the @xmath7 breit frame , as was discussed in the calculation of the pion form factor from @xmath6 in ref . @xcite .",
    "therefore , within an approach with a fixed number of particles such a mechanism should be taken into account through an effective two - body current .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate in a covariant model , based on a nonconstant , symmetric vertex function , the effect of the pair term in the evaluation of electromagnetic form factors for a pion - like system composed by two identical fermions .",
    "it is well known that , to avoid divergences in the evaluation of the covariant triangle - diagram for the form factor some regularization has to be introduced . in refs .",
    "@xcite a pion-@xmath8 vertex function , non symmetric in the four - momenta of the quarks , was adopted . however",
    ", a non symmetric vertex can not be considered a realistic approximation of a @xmath8 bound - state amplitude and phenomenological problems arise ( e. g. , the form factor and the weak decay constant can not be simultaneously reproduced ) @xcite .",
    "another approach has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the fermion loop was regulated by considering a non - local photon vertex . in the present work , for describing the momentum part of the coupling between the constituents and the spin-0 system , we use a covariant model with the following form of the vertex function @xmath9 differently from @xcite , we adopt a vertex function which is symmetric by the exchange of the momentum of the two fermions and implies a light - front valence wave function with the same property , as shown in the following sections . in this way",
    ", we are simulating the symmetry properties of a bethe - salpeter amplitude derived from quantum field theory .",
    "the other main ingredient of our covariant model , for calculating the form factor of the composite system , is the electromagnetic current , that is taken in impulse approximation .",
    "it should be pointed out that within our approach such a current is conserved ( see sect .",
    "ii ) . in the spirit of ref . @xcite , we study the importance of the pair diagram evaluated in different breit frames , which differ for the direction of the spatial part of the momentum transfer .",
    "we analyze and compare two systems that have relativistic or nonrelativistic nature , respectively . in order to better define this feature",
    ", we first construct the valence wave function from the symmetric ansatz for the bethe - salpeter amplitude and then , from this wave function , we build up the transverse - momentum distribution of the constituents .",
    "this momentum distribution plays a twofold role , allowing one : i ) to make contact betwen our covariant model and dynamical models of the composite system , developed within approaches with a fixed number of particles , and , more important , ii ) to quantitatively define the two limiting cases that we will consider , namely the strongly and weakly relativistic systems . in the first case",
    ", we make calculations for a spin-0 model , well suited for the pion .",
    "then we compare these results with the ones obtained with a realistic pion wave function generated by a potential able to describe the meson spectroscopy@xcite . in the second case ,",
    "we artificially adjust the transverse momentum distribution of the model to the deuteron scale , to get insight into the pair - term contribution for a weakly relativistic system with a small average transverse momentum for the constituents ( getting rid of the lengthy algebra of the @xmath10 case , corresponding to the actual case of charged heavy mesons ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , our model for the spin - zero , two - fermion system with a symmetric vertex function is presented . in sec .",
    "iii , the light - front valence wave function for the covariant model is introduced , as well as the corresponding transverse momentum distribution and the corresponding elastic form factor . in sec",
    "iv , numerical results are presented for i ) the electromagnetic form factor of our model , ii ) the separate contribution of the pair term and iii ) the form factor corresponding to the valence component . in sec .",
    "v , we draw our conclusions .",
    "in our model , the electromagnetic current for a two - fermion composite system with spin equal to 0 - i.e. , a pion - like system considered as @xmath11 bound state - is calculated in one - loop approximation ( triangle diagram ) , modelling the bethe - salpeter amplitude through a symmetric vertex function in momentum space with a pseudoscalar coupling between pion and quark degrees of freedom .",
    "this coupling is suggested by a simple effective lagrangian ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath12 the coupling constant @xmath13 is given by the goldberg - treiman relation at the quark level , namely @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the mass of the constituents and @xmath16 the pion decay constant .",
    "the electromagnetic current of @xmath17 is obtained from the covariant expression corresponding to the triangle diagram ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) : @xmath18\\lambda(k , p^{\\prime } ) \\lambda(k , p )   \\ ,   \\label{jmu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the number of colors , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the initial and final momenta of the system , @xmath23 is the momentum transfer and @xmath24 the spectator quark momentum .",
    "the factor 2 stems from isospin algebra .",

    "( [ jmu ] ) , we introduce the symmetric vertex function of eq .",
    "( [ vertex ] ) .",
    "this vertex function produces a light - front wave function symmetric by the interchange of quark and antiquark momenta , and is not affected by the conceptual difficulties associated with the use of the nonsymmetric regulator , as mentioned in the introduction ( see refs.@xcite ) . since we have not specified the dynamics which drives the bethe - salpeter amplitude , we have to resort to a physical condition for normalizing the bethe - salpeter vertex . as a matter of fact , the normalization constant @xmath27 in the vertex function , eq . ( [ vertex ] ) ,",
    "is fixed by imposing the charge normalization condition ( i.e. the pion form factor at zero momentum transfer must be equal to 1 ) .",
    "in our analysis we consider breit frames , where the momentum transfer @xmath28 has the spatial component parallel to the @xmath29 plane . by using front - form variables , i.e. @xmath30",
    "one has @xmath31 the drell - yan condition @xmath32 is recovered with @xmath33 , while the @xmath34 condition @xcite comes with @xmath35 .",

    "the initial and final momenta of the composite spin-0 bound state are : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "as well known , the pion form factor can be extracted from the covariant expression : @xmath41 if covariance and current conservation are fulfilled in a model calculation , one can obviously use any frame and any nonvanishing component of the current to calculate the electromagnetic form factor .",

    "the difference in the sign of the imaginary parts of @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the intervals @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the mathematical signature of the pair production mechanism , which appears just in the second interval .",
    "the sum of the contributions @xmath44 and @xmath68 yields the covariant result , dependent upon @xmath69 only .",

    "( [ k4 ] ) comes from @xmath73 .",
    "the position of both poles in @xmath59 are @xmath74 in the limit of @xmath75 .",

    "the phase - space factor in the denominator of eq .",

    "therefore the integrand goes to a constant for @xmath75 , and thus @xmath76 is proportional to @xmath70 in this limit , because of the range of the @xmath45 integration .",
    "a relevant feature in the analysis of the form factor is given by the presence of a contribution which is instantaneous in the light - front time , and is produced by the instantaneous term present in the dirac propagator . as a matter of fact , the dirac propagator can be decomposed using the front - form momenta as follows @xcite @xmath81 where the second term , proportional to @xmath82 , is an instantaneous term in the light - front time .",

    "physically , in the external legs only light - front propagating particles are allowed .",
    "it is worth noting that the effect of the instantaneous terms , which are present in a bethe - salpeter approach , could be included in effective ( many - body ) operators to be used together with the valence wave function @xcite .    in the present model",

    "iv for details ) , differently from the case of a nonsymmetric ansatz for the bethe - salpeter amplitude , where @xmath106 @xcite .    equation ( [ fwf ] ) represents a point of contact between a field theoretical approach and the ffhd with a fixed number of particles , adopting an impulse approximation current operator . indeed , including a proper factor in @xmath107 , namely @xmath108 and normalizing the wave function",
    "one can recover the ffhd expression for the form factor , @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , putting @xmath110 , one obtains the standard ffhd expression in the frame @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the valence component of the light - front wave function , eq . ( [ wf1 ] ) , is not an eigenfunction of the total angular momentum , since it is only one of the components of the pion state in the fock space .",
    "therefore , we can not directly compare the valence wave function of the present model with the wave functions corresponding to approaches with a fixed number of particles @xcite , which are eigenfunctions of the intrinsic angular momentum @xcite .",
    "however , in order to make contact with dynamical models , we introduce the transverse momentum probability density @xmath111 by integrating @xmath112 over @xmath113 , we obtain the probability of the valence component in the pion : @xmath114    furthermore , the transverse momentum probability density vs @xmath115 results to be very useful for a quantitative definition of strongly and weakly relativistic composite systems .",
    "indeed high values of the transverse momentum distribution for @xmath116 are a distinctive feature of a strongly relativistic system .",

    "2 , the results for the pion form factor are shown and compared to the data of refs.@xcite .",
    "the full - model calculations , eq .",
    "( [ ffactor ] ) , nicely agree with the new data for the pion form factor @xcite .",
    "therefore , our model , based on a non - constant , symmetric vertex can reproduce the form factor data consistently with the experimental value of @xmath16 , while for the nonsymmetric regulator this was not possible@xcite .",
    "remarkably , in order to reproduce simultaneously @xmath16 and the experimental form factor within our model , the constituent quark mass has to be chosen in the range between 0.2 and 0.3 gev .",
    "compatibility between form factor and decay constant has been also achieved in @xcite , where a constant pion-@xmath129 vertex and a nonlocal photon vertex were adopted .    the form factor in the breit frame with @xmath110 ( @xmath32 ) , where the pair - term contribution is zero , is identical to the sum of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , calculated in the frame corresponding to @xmath35 , as it must be for a covariant model .",
    "2 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , for @xmath35 , are also shown . differently from the case @xmath110 , for @xmath35 the form factor is dominated by the pair production process , except near @xmath101 . at high values of the momentum transfer the form factor",
    "is completely exhausted by the pair - term contribution .",
    "it is worth noting that such a dominance is mainly due to a kinematical effect and appears to be fairly model independent ( see also ref.@xcite ) . a qualitative argument , which is applicable to the reference frame with @xmath34 and essentially follows the work of sawicki@xcite , is given in what follows .    since the form factor is dimensionless , one can write qualitatively @xmath132 at the same time , see the discussion in sect .",
    "ii , the contribution of the pair production amplitude to the form factor , is roughly @xmath133 the validity of such an approximation is related to the momentum cutoff in the vertex function , and therefore it is not reliable for large values of @xmath70 . recalling that for @xmath35 @xmath134 the estimate of the ratio of the above contributions",
    "is given by @xmath135 at the qualitative level , we can roughly say from eq .",
    "( [ q3 ] ) that the two contributions to the form factor are expected to have about the same magnitude when @xmath136 , which gives for the pion @xmath137 0.01 ( gev / c)@xmath0 .",
    "our model calculation yields @xmath137 0.03 ( gev / c)@xmath0 . in ref.@xcite , for the kaon it was shown that the pair term contribution becomes dominant for @xmath138 0.2 ( gev / c)@xmath0 , while our estimate ( eq .",
    "( [ q3 ] ) ) gives @xmath139 0.13 ( gev / c)@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , one could argue that our crude estimate is able to give a momentum scale where sizeable effects due to the pair production term are expected for @xmath35",
    ".    the contributions of the instantaneous part of the dirac propagator to @xmath49 and @xmath47 , called @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively , are also shown in fig . 2 for @xmath35 .",
    "one can physically understand why in @xmath47 the instantaneous part is important and dominates at high momentum transfers .",
    "the interpretation is the following : in principle , see fig . 1 ( b ) , the spectator quark can be exchanged between incoming and outgoing pion at a given instant @xmath142 , while the pair of quark and antiquark has been produced by the virtual photon at an earlier stage . as the magnitude of the momentum @xmath143 increases , the time fluctuation for the virtual process decreases and favours the instantaneous exchange of the spectator quark between the initial and final pion .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "2 shows the dominance of @xmath141 in the pion form factor as the momentum transfer increases .",
    "it is worth noting that the value of @xmath140 is nonzero because of the specific analytic structure of the vertex . as a matter of fact , @xmath140 is nonzero , because of the presence of a pole in eq .",

    "moreover , we observe that the instantaneous term of the dirac propagator gives a small contribution to the pair term , as well as to @xmath168 .",

    "is peaked at @xmath172 , while for the ffhd model of refs.@xcite the peak occurs around @xmath173 .",
    "the ffhd model of refs.@xcite is based on a mass operator with the effective interaction of ref.@xcite , which includes one - gluon - exchange and linear confinement terms . the pion model from this mass operator , in the @xmath32 frame ,",
    "has a charge radius of 0.46 fm for pointlike constituent quarks .",
    "this value largely explains why the position of the peak appears at an higher value of the transverse momentum with respect to our model , which has a radius of 0.74 fm .    in summary , for a weakly relativistic system with spin equal to 0",
    ", the valence contribution to the form factor yields a good approximation of the whole form factor up to @xmath174 in any reference frame .",
    "therefore , one can argue that the evaluation of @xmath175 can be considered a reliable approximation to the full form factor in this case .      in order to study in more detail the pair - term contribution ,",
    "we show in fig . 7",
    "the ratio between @xmath176 and the full form factor .",
    "we compare the results of our covariant model @xmath177 with the kinematical estimate , eqs .",
    "( [ q1 ] ) and ( [ q2 ] ) , given by @xmath178 this kinematical estimate of the pair term works fairly well for the pion , while it overestimates the contribution of @xmath179 for the weakly relativistic system , due to the rapid fall - off of the momentum distribution which makes eq .",
    "( [ q2 ] ) unreliable . in fig .",
    "7 , we also report the following ratio @xmath180 where @xmath181 and @xmath182 are the pion form factor evaluated in the drell - yan frame and in the @xmath34 frame , respectively , within the ffhd model of ref.@xcite , using pointlike constituent quarks and the one - body current . such a ratio could yield insight on the relevance in ffhd of two - body current contributions corresponding to the pair term .",
    "indeed , @xmath181 represents an estimate of @xmath183 , while @xmath182 should describe @xmath184 ( cf .",

    "4 ) and therefore one can argue that @xmath185 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the ratio @xmath186 qualitatively agrees with the results of our covariant model and with the model - independent kinematical estimate ( see fig .",
    "thus , the suppression of @xmath187 in the @xmath188 frame with respect to the drell - yan frame can be explained in terms of a missing contribution in the current , that we could identify with two - body current contributions related to the pair term .    for the sake of completeness , @xmath189 and @xmath190",
    "are also shown in fig .",
    "7 for a weakly relativistic sytem . since @xmath191",
    ", one can rely only on model calculations for inferring the dominance of the valence contribution with respect to the nonvalence , over a wide range of momentum transfer .",
    "we have also evaluated @xmath186 for our mock deuteron and we have found @xmath192 . this result confirms the small effect of the pair term for a spin-0 weakly relativistic system .",
    "within a covariant model with a vertex function which is symmetric in the momentum space of the constituents , we have calculated the electromagnetic form factor for a two - fermion , pion - like system .",
    "such a model has allowed us to perform a detailed analysis of the pair - term contribution both changing the orientation of the breit frame , where the form factor is calculated , and the dynamical scale of the system .",
    "we have used a pseudoscalar coupling for the pion-@xmath129 vertex and a current for the point - like constituents in impulse approximation .",
    "it is worth noting that in our approach the current of the whole system is conserved .",
    "we have adopted for the first time a nonconstant , symmetric ansatz for the bethe - salpeter amplitude , and we have obtained the valence component of the pion state by projecting out the bethe - salpeter amplitude on the @xmath193 hypersurface . the symmetric vertex function implies a valence wave function with the same property . in this way we have overcomed some previous conceptual and phenomenological difficulties related to the use of a nonsymmetric regulator for describing the pion . as a matter of fact , the form factor and the weak decay constant can not be simultaneously reproduced with a nonsymmetric vertex function ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) .    in our covariant model for the pion , the two free parameters , the constituent quark mass @xmath194 and the regulator mass @xmath195 , have been fixed as follows : i ) the constituent quark mass was chosen as @xmath123 gev from the meson spectroscopy @xcite , ii ) the regulator mass @xmath124 gev was found by fitting the experimental weak decay constant , @xmath125 mev . as a consequence ,",
    "the form factor obtained in our covariant model nicely agrees with the new data for the pion form factor @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that , if we wish to reproduce simultaneously @xmath16 and the form factor data with our approach , the constituent quark mass should be chosen in the range between 0.2 and 0.3 gev .",
    "another interesting outcome of our symmetric model is that the probability of the pion valence component , @xmath104 , is less than 1 ( about @xmath196 ) , at variance with previous covariant calculations @xcite where @xmath197 .",
    "the em form factor of the pion - like system has been decomposed in two contributions , with the second one given by the pair - diagram term .",
    "the separation of the covariant result in such contributions is unique and does not depend on any particular dynamical model used to generate our choice of bs vertex , as long as the four - dimensional impulse approximation is adopted to calculate the em current ( see eq .",
    "( [ jmu ] ) ) .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , but with a nonconstant , symmetric vertex function , we have investigated the frame dependence of the pair - term contribution to the form factor of pion - like systems .",
    "our conclusions strengthen and generalize the conclusions of ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular , after introducing a transverse momentum distribution to distinguish between strongly and weakly relativistic systems , we have also analyzed the form factor for the second case .    in general the magnitude of the pair - term contribution in the electromagnetic current depends on the frame , because a dynamical transformation change the relative weight of valence and nonvalence contributions in the fock state and then in the form factor , while the sum , that is an invariant quantity , does not . for strongly relativistic systems , as the pion",
    ", the effect is dramatic : in the breit frame where @xmath34 the form factor is largely dominated by the pair diagram for @xmath198 , while adjusting the model to the deuteron scale ( weakly relativistic system ) , the pair term becomes negligible at low momentum transfer and only contributes by 30% at @xmath199 .",
    "the rapid fall - off of the valence component contribution to the form factor of the pion for purely longitudinal momentum transfers , @xmath200 , is a feature which can be understood also by a general , crude kinematical estimate .",
    "as matter of fact , the ratio between the pair contribution and the full form factor is roughly given by ( see also , e. g. , @xcite ) @xmath201 from such an estimate one can have some insight on the role played by the mass of the composite system , in determining the onset of the importance of the pair diagram in the form factor .",
    "finally , we have compared the results of our covariant model for the pion form factor to the ones developed within the front form hamiltonian dynamics , based on one - body current operators .",
    "such a comparison has shown that some general features are shared .",
    "in particular , the fall - off of the valence contribution in the @xmath34 frame faster than the one in the @xmath32 frame can be recovered in the ffhd approach .",
    "it should be pointed out that the ffhd calculations do not include the contribution of the pair term to the form factor , which should appear as a two - body current contribution .    in the case of the deuteron scale ( weakly relativistic system ) , the relevance of the pair - term contribution is shifted towards higher values of the momentum transfer ( 2 - 4 ( gev / c)@xmath0 ) . therefore , these encouraging results of our exploratory analysis at the deuteron scale urge studies which take into account the vector nature of the deuteron .",
    "the investigation of the pair - term contribution carried out within the covariant model of the present work could give a first suggestion for an explicit form of the two - body current contribution to be used within phenomenological ffhd approaches .",
