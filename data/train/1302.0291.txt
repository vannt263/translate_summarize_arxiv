    "higher - dimensional black holes gather much attention in the context of modern unified theories of interactions ( see for a review  @xcite ) .",
    "it is understood that the higher - dimensional black holes are very different from the four - dimensional ones in some aspects . in four dimensions , stationary black holes in a vacuum must have spherical horizons , and are uniquely characterized by their mass and angular momentum . in higher dimensions , however , black holes with unusual horizon topology exist in addition to black holes with spherical horizon topology  @xcite .",
    "the first discovery of the black hole solutions with @xmath0 topology , black ring solutions , was made in five dimensions by emparan and reall  @xcite .",
    "the black ring solutions reveal that a black hole in a vacuum is not uniquely characterized only by its mass and angular momenta in higher dimensions . after this pioneering work",
    ", various types of black ring solutions have been found by many authors  @xcite .",
    "it is important to study their geometrical properties and physical phenomena that occur around each of them in order to understand the differences between black holes and black rings .",
    "one of the important steps to clarify the geometry of spherical black holes and black rings is the studies of geodesics in these spacetimes .",
    "for example , the separability in the hamilton - jacobi equation for geodesic motion , which is a general property in arbitrary - dimensional myers - perry black holes  @xcite , implies that the black holes have the hidden symmetries called killing tensors . on the other hand , in the case of singly rotating black rings ,",
    "such separation of variables occurs for some special cases of geodesics : the geodesics on the rotational axis or the equatorial plane , and the geodesics for the massless particles with zero - energy  @xcite .",
    "recently , the hamilton - jacobi equation in these separable cases were solved analytically  @xcite .    in four dimensions ,",
    "a massive particle moving around a black hole has two types of orbits : bound orbits by the gravitational force , and unbound ones .",
    "a part of bound orbits are bounded in a region outside the black hole horizon , where the centrifugal force prevents the particles from falling into the horizon .",
    "there are circular orbits that are stable against small perturbations as special cases of the bounded orbits .",
    "in contrast , there is no stable circular orbit of massive particles in higher - dimensional schwarzschild black holes , nor at least on the equatorial planes in the five - dimensional myers - perry black holes  @xcite .",
    "this fact is completely different from the four - dimensional case .",
    "however , stable bound orbits of massive particles exist around a black ring if the thickness parameter is less than a critical value  @xcite .",
    "the result suggests that we can distinguish a black ring from a spherical black hole with the same mass and the same angular momentum by the orbits of massive particles .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that chaotic motion of massive particles appears  @xcite .",
    "it indicates that there is not the sufficient number of constants of motion for integration of geodesic equations for a massive particle in black ring spacetimes .",
    "how about massless particles ? in four - dimensional black holes , there exists no bounded orbit of massless particles in a finite region outside the horizon though there are unstable circular orbits of massless particles .",
    "higher - dimensional spherical black holes with the asymptotic flatness would have the same property as the four - dimensional ones .",
    "in contrast , in black holes with the asymptotic structure of the kaluza - klein type  @xcite , a massless particle with nonvanishing momenta in the directions of extra dimensions could be bounded in a finite region .",
    "the most simple example of such nonasymptotically flat black holes is a black string with periodic identification along the string direction .",
    "the geometry is given by the direct product of a schwarzschild spacetime with a one - dimensional circle , s@xmath1 .",
    "a massless particle that has nonvanishing momentum along s@xmath1 behaves as a massive particle in the four - dimensional schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "hence , such a massless particle can be bounded around the black string .",
    "are there bounded orbits of massless particles around a black ring ? on the one hand , since a black ring spacetime is asymptotically flat , it seems that massless particles can not be bounded around it . on the other hand , since the geometry of a black ring approaches the one of a black string in a region near the horizon , then we expect that a massless particle could be bounded around it if the particle had nonvanishing angular momenta in two independent angular directions .    in this paper , we investigate null geodesics in the singly rotating black ring geometry in five dimensions as a moving particle system in a two - dimensional potential .",
    "we show the existence of stable bound orbits of massless particles and the existence of bounded orbits of massless particles generally in a finite region outside the horizon .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the following section provides the singly rotating black ring geometry and the hamilton formalism for a massless particle around a black ring . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we show the existence of stable bound orbits of massless particles in the case that the black ring thickness parameter is smaller than a critical value .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] shows that there exist more general orbits of massless particles bounded in a finite domain outside the black ring horizon .",
    "we consider the metric of singly rotating black rings given by @xmath2 with @xmath3 where the ranges of the ring coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 are given by @xmath6 and the angular coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 are periodic in @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 denotes the radius of the black ring .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 describe the thickness of the black ring and the rotational velocity in the @xmath8-direction through @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "these parameters should be chosen in the range @xmath14 and related as @xmath15 to avoid the conical singularities at @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the event horizon and the ergosurface in the @xmath18 topology are located at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .      throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the hamiltonian formalism for a massless particle .",
    "motion of a massless particle is governed by the hamiltonian , @xmath21 with the null condition @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the canonical momentum . for the black rings , @xmath24",
    "is given by the inverse of eq .  .",
    "since the metric   admits three killing vectors , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , there exist three constants of motion , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are energy , angular momenta in the @xmath8- and the @xmath7-direction of a massless particle , respectively . substituting eqs .   into eq .",
    ", we obtain the two - dimensional effective hamiltonian , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the effective potential given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 in eq .",
    ", we have introduced the normalized angular momenta , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the equations of motion for eq .",
    "are @xmath38 where the overdot denotes the differentiation with respect to an affine parameter on each world line of the massless particle .",
    "the null condition   becomes @xmath39 note that the effective potential   is symmetric with respect to @xmath40 , whereas asymmetric with respect to @xmath41 , because the black ring described by the metric   rotates only in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath42 without loss of generality in what follows .",
    "further , we consider future - directed null geodesics with positive energy @xmath43 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the existence of local minimum points of the effective potential @xmath33 . in the case @xmath44 at the points , they correspond to stable stationary orbits of massless particles .    throughout the following discussion we use the new",
    "coordinates @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 figure  [ fig : coordinates ] shows the relations of @xmath47 and @xmath45 .",
    "the new coordinate system has an advantage because the metric is written in the well known form , @xmath48 , in the flat limit of eq .  .",
    "in what follows we employ the unit @xmath49 for simplicity .     coordinates and the @xmath45 coordinates .",
    "the solid curves denote @xmath50 , and the dashed curves denote @xmath51 in the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane.,width=302 ]    we consider the special stationary motion that satisfies @xmath54 and @xmath55 , or equivalently , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . then the equations of motion   and lead to @xmath58 and the stationary point conditions for @xmath33 , @xmath59 where @xmath33 is the function of @xmath52 and @xmath53 given by eq .   as @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , from the null condition  , @xmath33 must satisfy @xmath61    the stationary orbits of massless particles satisfying eqs .   and with nonvanishing @xmath29 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , are tangent to the null killing vectors that are linear combinations of @xmath25 , @xmath27 , and @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the projection of the orbit on a @xmath64 surface makes a toroidal spiral curve on a two - dimensional torus , a direct product of s@xmath1 with a constant radius @xmath52 generated by @xmath26 and s@xmath1 with a constant radius @xmath53 generated by @xmath27 .",
    "then , we call such a stationary orbit a _ toroidal spiral orbit _ of a massless particle .      since @xmath33 includes the two parameters @xmath63 and @xmath62 , then it is useful to consider the direct product space : the two - dimensional space of @xmath45 times the two - dimensional parameter space of @xmath65 , i.e. , the four - dimensional space defined as @xmath66 . in @xmath67 , eqs .",
    "defines a two - dimensional surface , say @xmath68 , which represents the set of stationary points .",
    "we consider the restriction of @xmath33 to @xmath68 , denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "the condition @xmath70 makes a curve on @xmath68 , and each point on the curve corresponds to a stationary orbit of a massless particle of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i.e. , a stationary toroidal spiral orbit . in particular ,",
    "if a point on @xmath68 satisfying the condition   is a local minimum of @xmath33 , the corresponding stationary toroidal spiral orbit is stable .",
    "the condition for a stationary point of @xmath33 to be a local minimum is @xmath73 at the point , where @xmath74 is the restriction of the hessian matrix of @xmath33 , @xmath75 to @xmath68 . in order to seek local minimum points of @xmath33 satisfying eq .  , we find @xmath68 first , and then we inspect the conditions   and .    here , we study the surface @xmath68 in detail",

    "respectively . therefore , there exist two branches of @xmath68 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "they are projected uniquely into domains where @xmath85 and @xmath86 take real values in the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane .",
    "we discuss the existence of stationary toroidal spiral orbits of massless particles in the black ring spacetime with @xmath87 as an example .",
    "we take @xmath88 first , and consider the contours @xmath89 and @xmath90 on it .",

    "[ fig : real02 ] .",
    "as will be seen later , both of @xmath93 and @xmath94 are nonvanishing on the segment , and then stable toroidal spiral orbits of massless particles are realized at any points on the segment .",
    "the stable toroidal spiral orbits make a one - parameter family along the segment .",
    "the stability condition is marginally satisfied at the points p and q. it means that there exist two marginally stable toroidal spiral orbits similar to the _ innermost stable circular orbit _",
    "( isco ) of a massive particle moving around a black hole in four dimensions .",
    "the point p , near the event horizon , corresponds to the _ innermost stable toroidal spiral orbit _",

    ", no stable toroidal spiral orbit appears in the other branch @xmath95 for @xmath87 . for thinner black rings ,",
    "stable toroidal spiral orbits would be found in both the branches .",
    "we discuss the thickness parameter @xmath11 with which the black ring has the stable toroidal spiral orbits of massless particles .",
    "numerical analysis shows that the crossing points p and q of contours @xmath89 and @xmath90 approach each other as @xmath11 increases .",

    "hence , the critical value of @xmath11 is approximately given by @xmath101 .",
    "the condition to determine the critical value @xmath96 is discussed in appendix  [ sec : appa ] . on the other hand , the contours @xmath89 and @xmath90 have no crossing point in the case @xmath99 . for the thin black rings with @xmath102 ,",
    "there exist stable toroidal spiral orbits of massless particles , while for the black ring with @xmath103 toroidal spiral orbits become unstable .",
    "in this section , we consider nonstationary motion of massless particles trapped in a bounded domain outside the black ring horizon .",
    "it is natural to consider that there exist orbits wandering around the stable toroidal spiral orbits , which are discussed in the previous section .",
    "such bounded orbits appear if particles are confined by an effective potential barrier .",
    "since massless particles must satisfy the null condition  , the contour @xmath44 is a set of turning points .",
