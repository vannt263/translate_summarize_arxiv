    "the study of charged solutions to einstein s equations is certainly an interesting topic since the beginning of relativity , and the possibility for an astrophysical object to possess an appreciable amount of electric charge has been debated for a long time @xcite .",
    "anisotropic charged solutions were studied in @xcite , where relevance of charge effects is highlighted , and , under self  similarity assumption , in @xcite .",
    "many numerical studies on the subject exist ",
    "see e.g. @xcite  even outside the realm of relativistic fluids , such as charged scalar fields @xcite .    in particular , charged collapsing object have attracted researchers attention , for different reasons .",
    "on one side , if charge addition prevents the collapsing solution to become singular , reissner ",
    "nordstrm regular interiors could be modeled consequently @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "if a singularity forms , it is extremely intriguing to investigate the charge effects to the causal behavior of the solution , in particular if the singularity is completely hidden inside a trapped region or a naked singularity exists , in the latter case providing counterexamples to cosmic censorship conjecture .    in @xcite",
    "the charged spherical dust cloud collapse was studied to find that shell focusing singularities are avoided in general , obtaining either shell crossing singularities or completely regular solutions , depending on mass  to  charge ratio . in the same paper",
    "it was conjectured that shell crossing effects could be averted if spatial gradient of pressure remains nonzero . in the present paper",
    "we determine analytically a class of charged spherical exact solutions undergoing gravitational collapse , and study their final state .",
    "these solutions are in general anisotropic , but contain the charged dust model studied in @xcite as a limit case .",
    "we find that shell focusing singularity formation is avoided for non central shells even for this wider class of solutions , and the solution either remains completely regular , or shell crossing singularity is developed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] is devoted to introducing the model  in particular , in subsection [ sec : addq ] the procedure of charge addition to a spherically symmetric solution is sketched , while the class of ( uncharged ) background models is introduced in subsection [ sec : ns ]  see also the appendix for the full list of conditions satisfied by these models .",
    "the new ( charged ) solutions are derived in section [ sec : chargedsol ] and their relevant properties are studied in section [ sec : sing ] , whereas conclusions are left for the final section .",
    "in this section we introduce relativistic charged models in general , and recall the class of model that we will perturb in next section using an electromagnetic charge .",
    "we start from a spherical material described by the line element , written in comoving coordinates @xmath0 , @xmath1 carrying a non - vanishing electric charge density @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce the skew - symmetrc maxwell tensor @xmath3 and , due to spherical symmetry and the absence of magnetic monopole @xcite , the only nonzero component is @xmath4 . from the maxwell s equations @xmath5}=0,\\ ] ] being @xmath6 a timelike unit vector field , we find that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is arbitrary and is related to the charge density by the relation @xmath9 let us consider einstein equations @xmath10 for the line element , where @xmath11 is the sum of the contributions of the stress energy tensor induced by the material structure and the stress energy electromagnetic tensor @xmath12 that using is found to satisfy @xmath13 and therefore is diagonal when written as a @xmath14tensor .",
    "the above procedure allows to add a charge to a given spherical model .      in the following we are going to describe the spherical model that will be perturbed with an electromagnetic charge following the above scheme .",
    "the model considered here has been found and fully described in @xcite , but for sake of completeness we briefly recall here the basic properties .",
    "we consider a source of gravitational field given by an elastic material under isothermal conditions .",
    "the stress energy tensor in comoving coordinates is diagonal , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy density and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the radial and the tangential pressure , respectively .",
    "as described in @xcite , the additional information to close the system of einstein equations are supplied by a constitutive function @xmath19 where @xmath20 . note that @xmath21 is a function of the spatial coordinates and of the space ",
    "space part of the metric , not depending on the angular coordinates @xmath22 and @xmath23 for symmetry reasons .",
    "the quantities in are related to @xmath21 by the identities @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the matter density and @xmath26 is an arbitrary function .",
    "this framework suggests , as a more convenient way to describe the metric , the use of area ",
    "radius coordinates @xmath27 , in such a way that the line element becomes @xcite @xmath28 in @xcite it is described how , if we choose a @xmath29linear constitutive function , @xmath30 determined by the choice of two free functions @xmath31 and @xmath32  constrained at most to fulfil some reasonability conditions that we will review in a moment  then einstein field equations for the metric takes the form    @xmath33    where @xmath34 it is quite straightforward to verify that the arbitrary function @xmath35 is the misner  sharp mass @xmath36 , whereas the @xmath37 is related to the comoving description of the matter through the relation @xmath38 . also observe that @xmath39 as one can find translating the line element into .    using and ,",
    "the components of @xmath40 as functions of @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 the above class contains , as particular cases , tolman ",
    "lemaitre dust models  corresponding to @xmath43 and @xmath44  and vanishing radial pressure models  taking @xmath43 and letting @xmath37 possibly depending on @xmath45 too . in @xcite",
    "some particular cases separately studied in literature including the above cited are reviewed .",
    "as said before , in order to describe reasonably a collapsing matter , some conditions must be placed on the arbitrary functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 . using the notation from (",
    "* definition 2 ) , we suppose that they are chosen in such a way that is a _ collapsing area - radius separable ( ars ) spacetime _  see appendix [ sec : ars ] for a complete list of assumptions .",
    "this implies , among the others , that w.e.c .",
    "is satisfied and that @xmath35 and @xmath37 are positive and regular functions whose taylor development in a neighborhood of @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 note also that in view of the definition given in @xcite it must be @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "finally , in order to obtain a global model , a matching with an external space will be performed at @xmath50 , requiring that the fundamental forms of the two metrics at @xmath51 coincide ( israel  darmois junction conditions ) . from",
    "we observe that the radial pressure @xmath17 in general does not vanish along @xmath51 , which as well known is a necessary and sufficient condition to match the solution with a schwarzschild exterior . in this ore general case ,",
    "a natural choice for the exterior metric is given by the generalized vaidya spacetime @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an arbitrary ( non negative ) function .",
    "nordstrm metric is contained here as a particular case ( @xmath54 , with @xmath55 constants ) .",
    "the immersion of @xmath51 in the two spacetimes can be parameterized respectively by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and junction conditions are found to be @xmath58",
    "let us consider the spherical model above recalled and let us add a charge density as described in section [ sec : addq ] .",
    "coupling between elasticity and charge gives rise to a field theory where lagrangian density of the elastic material @xcite @xmath59  where @xmath60 denotes the matter density , @xmath61  sums up with the maxwell lagrangian density @xmath62 .",
    "then using belinfante  rosenfeld theorem the total stress energy tensor @xmath63 is now given by the sum @xmath64 , that in view of and is diagonal when expressed in comoving coordinates .",
    "moreover , the perturbation given by depends on @xmath65 only .",
    "this suggests the idea that the new model may belong to the class considered in section [ sec : ns ] . in particular , if we search for new functions @xmath66 , @xmath67 such that the new stress energy tensor obeys relations and for these new functions , it is easy to check that we are led to the following definition : @xmath68 in other words , the information about the charge effect can be completely encoded into the mass and the @xmath37 function in such a way that the solution obtained represent a _ fictitious _ material belonging to the same class , though with a _",
    "new _ choice of the arbitrary functions .",
    "note that this procedure is possibile since charge in is added to the _ off - shell _ relations and where @xmath69 is not explicitly depending on @xmath65 .",
    "of course , the new degree of freedom introduced with the charge modifies the constitutive relation between the elements of the total stress energy tensor , and indeed now we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 is given by . at this stage , however , a remark is in place : although @xmath35 and @xmath37 satisfy all the properties sketched in section [ sec : ns ] and listed in the appendix  especially regularity and in view of and one can not expect that the same properties are satisfied by @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "put it in another way , choosing the two arbitrary functions as in and above , the charged model obtained is _ not _ an ars collapsing spacetime in the sense of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2 ) , and then results from there do not work here .",
    "for instance , we can not exclude shell crossing singularity formation  that on the contrary is likely to occur as we will see later .",
    "nevertheless it is easy to see that the new model automatically satisfies the weak energy condition if the old does .",
    "moreover , if we require regularity of the energy density in the center , recalling that @xmath72 at initial time , the condition @xmath73 as @xmath74 is needed , as it can be seen using together with the facts that @xmath75 and @xmath76 at initial time . assuming regularity of the charge function @xmath77 as done for the other arbitrary functions , this amounts to say that @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , we have to assume that local isotropy at the center continues to hold once the charge is added . in comoving",
    "coordinates , using , that would mean that @xmath80    supposing that the local isotropy holds for the uncharged model , this means that @xmath81 whenever we tend to the regular center .",
    "recalling again the initial data @xmath72 , that implies that @xmath82 , and therefore the condition stated above on the behavior of the charge function must be strengthened as follows @xmath83",
    "in view of the lack of regularity at the center  see and  one can not expect that these solutions collapse completely to a shell focusing singularity . to begin , an important preliminary result can be immediately stated .",
    "[ thm : noncentral ] shell focusing singularity can not form from the collapse of non central shells of the charged elastic models described in section [ sec : chargedsol ] , unless a shell crossing singularity forms at an earlier comoving time .    we will actually show that , for each @xmath84 , the function @xmath85 must vanish for some @xmath860,r_0[$ ] . since the equation @xmath87 controls shell crossing singularity formation , we will deduce that shell focusing non central singularities can not form before possibile shell crossing singularities .    from , and",
    "recalling from that @xmath32 is strictly positive , the zeroes of @xmath67 corresponds to zeroes of @xmath88 .",
    "fixed @xmath89 , this quantity negatively diverges as @xmath90 , which means that the continuous function @xmath91 , that starts positive for @xmath92 , must vanish for some positive @xmath93 .    in view of the above result",
    ", non central shells either develop a shell crossing singularity or they stay regular , collapsing indefinitely to a stable non singular state or even bouncing and finally entering a period of expansion .",
    "shell crossing formation corresponds to the zeroes of the function @xmath37 ( that in comoving coordinates reads as @xmath94 ) , while no singularity formation is possible if @xmath95 vanishes  consider restated using @xmath66 and @xmath67 in place of @xmath35 , @xmath37 .",
    "actually , points of the @xmath65 plane where @xmath95 is negative describe a region where the dynamics of the spacetime is not allowed ; taking initial data such that this quantity is positive , and studying the evolution of this quantity for a fixed shell @xmath89 , if the quantity vanishes for some @xmath96 and attains negative values for smaller values of @xmath45 , this means that the shell labeled @xmath97 can not collapse beyond the limit value @xmath96 , then indefinitely tends to it or arrives there in a finite amount of comoving time , bouncing back and entering an expanding phase .    in view of the aforesaid , there exists a curve @xmath98 such that , for @xmath84 , @xmath99 is the greatest zero of the function @xmath85 between @xmath100 and @xmath97 ( recall that @xmath101 by the initial data choice ) .",
    "recalling for @xmath67 , we have to determine the zeroes of @xmath102 and using and , it is found explicitly that @xmath103    moreover , to investigate the physics of the collapse , we need to study the apparent horizon , implicitly defined by solution of equation @xmath104 recalling equations and we find the existence of _ two _ different horizon curves satisfying , whose behavior depends on the charge function @xmath77 . in particular , we have the following situation :    * when @xmath105 ( and @xmath106 ) : @xmath107 * when @xmath108 : @xmath109    as can be inferred from , when @xmath108 and @xmath110 , no horizon forms . in all other cases , we have two apparent horizons which bound the shell crossing curve @xmath111 one from below and the other from above . as said before , vanishing of the function @xmath112 could prevent shell crosing formation . from the above analysis , there is certainly a case when this happens , that is when no horizon formation takes place .",
    "indeed , in that case it must be @xmath113 throughout the whole evolution , and then on the curve @xmath111 , the quantity under square root in is negative .",
    "therefore , @xmath114 already vanished before @xmath111 which means that the solution remains regular for all times . to gain more information on the behavior of @xmath114 in this case ( @xmath115 ) , one can study the quantity @xmath116 along curves @xmath117 for @xmath1180,1]$ ] , finding that @xmath119 where @xmath120 with @xmath121 the denominator in is positive  is the leading term of @xmath122 which is positive by definition , see subsection [ sec : ns ]  therefore we have to study the sign of @xmath123 .",
    "in particular we have @xmath124 ( as it is the initial data ) and @xmath125 ( since @xmath110 ) .",
    "thus @xmath126 changes sign for some @xmath1270,1[$ ] , and then the zeroes of @xmath116 defines a curve @xmath128 which bounds @xmath111 from above as expected .      where the quantity under square root in changes sign  is defined , there exists a region  the shaded area below that curve  that can not be reached starting the collapse from @xmath129 . ]",
    "the collapse behavior is sketched in figure [ fig:1 ] , where a graphic is plotted with @xmath130 on the vertical axis to get rid of the central coordinate singularity .",
    "the collapse starts from @xmath129 and every shell collapses until it reaches @xmath131 where it can not proceed further since the quantity under square root in would be negative .",
    "then , once the shell radius reaches the value @xmath131 , it starts bouncing back entering an expanding phase . since @xmath132 as @xmath133 ,",
    "even the center remains regular for all times .",
    "[ rem : ak ] it can be seen that the quantity @xmath123 is given by the leading order term of the function @xmath134 , evaluated for @xmath135 .",
    "now let us examine the other cases .",
    "when @xmath108 and @xmath106 we can perform a similar study as before , finding that @xmath136 , with @xmath126 given by above , and then its sign is related to the sign of @xmath123 again .",
    "however , in this case both @xmath137 and @xmath138 are positive , so we have to consider separately the following two subcases :    * if @xmath123 admits one root in the interval @xmath1390,1[$ ] , then as before it remains defined a curve @xmath128 which bounds @xmath111 from above , and then the situation is the same as that depicted in figure [ fig:1 ] . *",
    "if @xmath140 in @xmath141 $ ] , then we have to evaluate @xmath116 along @xmath142 . for sake of simplicity",
    "we consider here only the case @xmath143 ( the special case @xmath144 can be discussed with similar methods ) .",
    "it can be found @xmath145 , where @xmath146 that is positive .",
    "evaluating finally @xmath116 on curves @xmath147 , one gets again a behavior of the kind @xmath145 , where @xmath148 and therefore the zeroes of @xmath116 describe a curve @xmath149 whose behavior is given by @xmath150 +   lies below the inner horizon , then a shell crossing singularity ",
    "denoted by the curve @xmath98  forms .",
    "the shaded area represents the trapped region . ]",
    "+ comparing the above equation with we conclude that @xmath151 for @xmath152 and then in this case a shell crossing singularity develops just after the formation of the outer horizon .",
    "the situation is represented in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "finally , case @xmath105 is yet left to be studied .",
    "it is easy to check that zeroes of @xmath116 corresponds to solutions to the equation @xmath153 - 2 q q ' r_u y^2 \\psi , _ r = q^2 \\left [ { \\psi , _ r}^2 - { q'}^2 y^2 \\right].\\ ] ] from this , using expansions , and and comparing the leading term of the left side member with the leading term of the right side member in the above equation leads to the following behavior for function @xmath154 such that @xmath155 : @xmath156 an immediate comparison with equation shows that @xmath151 for positive @xmath157 and then all shells as before undergo a shell crossing formation , and the situation is again represented in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "summarizing , we have that the behavior of the collapse is driven by the parameter @xmath158 defined in in the following way :    [ thm : fs ] under the assumptions made in section [ sec : chargedsol ] a shell crossing singularity forms up to the centre when :    1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath158 defined in is greater than 1 , or 2 .",
    "@xmath108 , @xmath159 and the function @xmath123 defined in is positive @xmath160 $ ] .    in all other cases , provided",
    "@xmath161 can be treated with similar methods as before , just taking into account higher order terms of the arbitrary functions .",
    "] the solution remains regular , and no singularity forms up to the center .",
    "the class of spherical models carrying an electromagnetic charge considered in this paper has been explicitly derived exploiting the description in terms of a state function @xmath19  see subsection [ sec : ns ] . since the addition of a charge modifies the stress  energy tensor with a quantity depending on @xmath65 , it is possible to derive the state function for the new solution , seen as a fictitious material .",
    "therefore , one can say that the process of solution charging is  under a mathematical point of view  internal to the class of models considered , i.e. those determined by the state function .",
    "although the charged solution does not satisfy all the regularity properties of the original one , however it is possible to explicitly derive the metric and then to study its properties .",
    "as we have seen , the electromagnetic charge deeply changes the final state of the solution .",
    "it is a well established fact indeed that the uncharged solutions here considered always develop a shell focusing singularity that in some case is naked  depending on taylor expansion of the arbitrary functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , see @xcite for full details . instead , here the formation of a shell focusing singularity is impossible for non central shells , and otherwise either the solution bounces back and enters an expanding phase , or a shell crossing singularity takes place . as is well known shell crossing singularities are tipler",
    " gravitationally weak @xcite and the spacetime may admit an extension beyond this kind of singularity , possibly developing a shell focusing singularity at a later comoving time .",
    "this issue still remains an open problem in general , that has been partially solved only for particular cases , as tolman ",
    "bondi models @xcite , where metric can be extended in a natural but _ non _ unique and , yet bounded , _ non _ regular way beyond the shell  crossing singularity .",
    "the occurence of the two situations  either regularity or shell crossing effect  is determined ( theorem [ thm : fs ] ) by the taylor development of @xmath35 , @xmath37 and the charge function @xmath77 .",
    "notice that , unlike the charged dust cloud case studied in @xcite , the final state is not determined exclusively by the charge  to  mass ratio at initial time @xmath162 , since now the mass depends on @xmath45 also and at initial time ( when @xmath72 ) we have @xmath163 , that in general does not allows to determine the coefficient @xmath164 needed in theorem [ thm : fs ] .",
    "however the avoidance of shell focusing singularities  up to spacetime extension as said before  already found in @xcite remains true for this wider class of ( generally anisotropic ) solutions , giving a first answer ( in the negative ) to the conjecture raised in @xcite that the occurence of shell crossing singularities was determined by the vanishing of the pressure spatial gradient .",
    "it emerges that electromagnetic charge completely changes the final state of the collapsing star in this anisitropic case .",
    "the models introduced in @xcite and recalled in section [ sec : ns ] completely depend on the choice of two functions @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "an _ ars spacetime _ is described by the metric , where  holds , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are two regular functions .",
    "since we consider initial data such that @xmath72 , the spacetime is defined in the set @xmath165 , and @xmath166 defines the junction hypersurface with the external solution  see end of section [ sec : model ] above .",
    "now we give a complete list of the properties that these functions must satisfy to obtain what in @xcite is termed as a _ collapsing _ ars spacetime .    *",
    "the arbitrary functions must be positive up to possible singularity formation , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , when @xmath169 ; * the weak energy condition ( w.e.c . )",
    "must hold .",
    "a sufficient condition is given by @xmath170 * regularity and isotropy of the metric at the center of symmetry must be imposed .",
    "it can be seen that this is equivalent to the following conditions : @xmath171 * the initial density is required to be decreasing outwards , which means that @xmath172 * shell  crossing singularity formation must be excluded .",
    "this leads to the ( sufficient ) conditions @xmath173 @xmath174 * shell  focusing singularities must form in a finite amount of comoving time .",
    "the mathematical conditions to express this requirement are @xmath175    in particular , regularity of @xmath35 and @xmath37 , together with - and allows to write developments and .",
