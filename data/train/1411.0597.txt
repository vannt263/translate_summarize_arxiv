    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary stars which contain a white dwarf ( the primary ) and an orbiting companion , usually a main - sequence star ( the secondary or the donor ) .",
    "the material is accreted by the primary through the inner lagrangian point from the roche - lobe filling secondary . in non - magnetic cvs",
    "an accretion disk is formed around the white dwarf .",
    "the region where the matter collides with the edge of the disk is known as the hot spot ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "dwarf novae ( dns ) of a su - uma type are one of the subclasses of cvs .",
    "the characteristic feature of su - uma stars is short orbital period ( below @xmath10 h ) . in their light",
    "curves one can observe eruptions classified as outbursts or superoutbursts .",
    "outbursts to superoutbursts occurrence ratio is ten to one . during superoutbursts su",
    "uma stars are about one magnitude brighter and , in the light curves , there are periodic light oscillations called superhumps .",
    "a superhump period is a few percent longer than the orbital period ( more in hellier 2001 ) .",
    "the period gap ( from @xmath11 to @xmath12 hours ) is an orbital period range where there is a significant dearth of active cvs .",
    "the standard evolution model assumes that around the @xmath13 hours the donor becomes fully convective and the magnetic braking , which is responsible for the angular momentum loss , is abruptly shut off . at that point",
    "cv systems evolve towards shorter periods as detached binaries .",
    "when the orbital period decreases to about 2 hours the mass transfer restarts .",
    "the angular momentum loss is caused by the emission of gravitational radiation ( paczyski 1981 ) and cvs reappear as active systems below the period gap ( for a review knigge et al .",
    "2011 ) .    up to now the variable star czev404 was analyzed only once ; caga and caga ( 2014 ) presented results of two observing campaigns of czev404 spanning the period from june to september 2012 and june to august 2012 . during that time one superoutburst in august 2012 and a several outbursts during the 2013 observation season were detected .",
    "based on their observations , czev404 is an eclipsing cataclismic variable of a su uma type .",
    "light curves of eclipsing dwarf novae are a reliable diagnostic tool for the theoretical interpretation of superoutburst and superhump mechanisms ( check smak 2013a , 2013b , bkowska and olech 2014 ) , hence our motivation for the new observing campaign of czev404 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follow : section 2 contains the description of observation runs , data reduction and global photometric behaviour of czev404 . in section 3",
    "we present the periodicity of the detected superhumps and eclipses .",
    "section 4 is a discussion chapter and the last section displays summary of our results .",
    "observations of czev404 reported in this work were obtained during 15 nights from 2014 june 18 to july 22 at the borowiec station of pozna astronomical observatory located in poland and during 3 nights from 2014 july 27 to august 1 in pisa in italy . during this time span",
    "we detected one outburst ( monitored during 3 nights ) and one superoutburst ( observed during 9 nights ) .",
    "most of our observations ( first 15 nights ) were carried out at the borowiec station .",
    "we used a 40 cm , f/4.5 newton reflector , equipped with a st-7 ccd camera providing a @xmath14 field of view .    due to unfavorable weather conditions in the last 3 nights of our campaign ,",
    "data collection was performed in italy . for this set of observations a newton reflector with a @xmath15 diameter , equipped with a kaf402 ccd camera",
    "was used .    in order to obtain the shortest possible exposure times all observations of the czev404",
    "were made in the `` white light '' ( clear filter ) .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 60 to 240 seconds depending on the weather conditions and the brightness of the object .    in total",
    ", we gathered 54.5 hours and obtained 2193 exposures of czev404 during 18 nights .",
    "table 1 presents a full journal of our ccd observations .",
    "we determined relative unfiltered magnitudes of czev404 by taking the difference between the magnitude of the variable and the mean magnitude of the three comparison stars . in fig .",
    "1 the map of a region is displayed with the variable star marked as v1 and the comparison stars as c1 , c2 and c3 , respectively .",
    "the equatorial coordinates and the brightness of comparison star c3 ( ra=@xmath16 , dec=@xmath17 , @xmath18 mag in @xmath19 filter ) are taken from the tycho-2 catalogue ( hog et al .",

    "knowing the orbital and superhump periods we can draw conclusions about the evolution of czev404 . in the diagram @xmath20 versus @xmath21 presented in fig .",
    "7 we display su uma stars , period bouncers and nova - like variables .",
    "the period excess was calculated as :    @xmath22    and for czev404 we obtained a value of @xmath23 .    the mass ratio of the binary @xmath24 can be obtained from the empirical formula introduced by patterson ( 1998 ) :    @xmath25    this results with the @xmath4 for czev404 . the tidal instability",
    "( whitehurst 1988 ) of the disk starts to work effectively for binaries with a mass ratio @xmath26 below @xmath27 .",
    "this assumption was used by osaki ( 1989 ) in the tti ( thermal - tidal instability ) model to explain the phenomenon of superoutbursts and superhumps .",
    "that is why such a high value of @xmath26 in czev404 poses a serious problem for the superhump mechanism .",
    "the detection of active dns in the period gap , for example tu men ( stolz and schoems 1981 ) , mn dra ( nogami et al .",

    "there are two mechanisms which are thought to drive the orbital angular momentum loss .",
    "first one is the magnetic wind breaking which is greatly reduced around orbital period @xmath13 hours when the secondary becomes fully convective ( verbunt and zwaan 1981 ) and the donor detaches from its roche - lobe . between the @xmath28 hour orbital period range , know as the orbital period gap , the number of cvs found is very low ( see gnsicke et al .",
    "2009 ) . at around @xmath29 hours ( howell et al .",
    "2001 ) the mass transfer is resumed because the secondary reestablished the roche lobe contact .",
    "further evolution of cvs is driven mainly by the second mechanism of the orbital angular momentum loss known as the gravitational radiation ( paczyski 1981 ) .",
    "su uma stars located in period gap and having roche lobe filling secondaries should be driven by gravitational wave radiation . at this orbital period ( @xmath30 hours ) both the angular momentum loss as well as the mass transfer should be low and according to the tti model these objects should be characterized by low activity .",
    "it is certainly not the case in such systems as czev404 or mn dra .",
    "the first suggestion that superhump period in majority of su uma stars changes with the common pattern appeared in olech et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) . since 2009 , kato et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2010 , 2012 . 2013 , 2014a , 2014b ) published extensive surveys concerning superhump period changes observed in su uma stars . according to these works the evolution of superhump period",
    "can be divided into three parts : stage a with a stable and longer period , stage b characterized by a positive period derivative and the last stage c with a shorter and stable period .",
    "several active dns in the period gap , i.e. sdss j170213 ( kato et al .",
    "2013 ) , css j203937 , v444 peg , master j212624 ( kato et al .",
    "2014a ) and mn dra ( kato et al .",
    "2014b ) were presented in surveys supervised by the japanese team and a part of them followed this scenario .",
    "however , some of the long period su uma stars seem to show only a decreasing superhump period across the entire superoutburst ( see for example sdss j1556 and uv per in kato et al . 2009 ) .",
    "czev404 seems to belong to the same group .",
    "our observations cover the entire superoutburst and there is a clear and a rather constant superhump period decrease observed over the whole interval of 17 days .",
    "it is worth noting that some of the czev404 system parameters are similar to mn dra , respectively , i.e. orbital periods @xmath31 days ( pavlenko et al . 2010 ) and @xmath2 days ( this work ) , superhump periods @xmath32 days ( kato et al . 2014b ) and @xmath0 days ( this work ) , the large period variations _ _",
    "p__=@xmath33 ( kato et al .",
    "2014b ) and _ _ p__=@xmath1 ( this work ) , and the mass ratio @xmath34 ( kato et al .",
    "2014b ) and @xmath4 ( this work ) .",
    "that is why both of these active dns from the period gap deserve more observations for further analysis of cv stars evolution .",
    "we summarize the results of the summer 2014 campaign of czev404 :    * during the two and half months of observations from 2014 june 18 to august 1 we detected one outburst and one superoutburst in czev404 .",
    "the outburst lasted at least 3 nights and the amplitude was not fewer then @xmath35 mag .",
    "the june 2014 superoutburst had the amplitude of brightness @xmath36 mag and had a duration of 17 nights .",
    "clear superhumps were detected during the superoutburst . * based on the maxima of superhumps we determined the superhump period @xmath0 days ( @xmath37 min ) .",
    "the orbital period @xmath38 days ( 141.1492 @xmath39 min ) was obtained using 17 eclipses .",
    "combining our data set and the moments of eclipses provided by caga and caga ( 2014 ) we found a more precise orbital period with the value of @xmath40 days ( @xmath41 min ) . *",
    "the superhump period was not stable during the july 2014 superoutburst of czev404 and it was decreasing with the high value of _ _ p__=@xmath1 .",
    "* with the stolz - schoembs ( 1984 ) formula we derived period excess @xmath42 and on the diagram @xmath20 versus @xmath21 czev404 is located in the period gap objects .",
    "* the mass ratio with the value of @xmath43 was obtained .",
    "such a high value is a problem for the tti model assuming @xmath44 for the superhump and the superoutburst mechanism .",
    "there is no doubt that czev404 is a unique variable star .",
    "it belongs to about one dozen of su uma stars located in the period gap .",
    "its orbital period is one of the longest among whole group of su uma variables .",
    "additionally , it is longest period eclipsing su uma star known and its high mass ratio poses a serious challenge for the tti model . certainly , czev404 should be studied further . both high speed photometry with 2-meter class telescope as well as spectroscopy with the world s",
    "largest telescopes would allow to precisely determine the basic parameters of the binary system .",
