    "the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite is one of the biggest mysteries in modern cosmology .",

    "scalar - tensor theory  @xcite , this is made possible by utilizing a matter - dependent effective potential to hide the scalar field at short distances . another interesting way of suppressing the scalar field on short scales is found in the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model  @xcite , in which a non - linear derivative self - coupling of the scalar is involved  @xcite . below a certain distance from the source on the dgp brane , the non - linear effect of the brane bending ( corresponding to the extra scalar mode ) plays an important role even for weak gravitational fields , successfully screening the scalar - mediated force  @xcite .",

    "<S> a scalar - tensor theory of gravity can be made not only to account for the current cosmic acceleration , but also to satisfy solar - system and laboratory constraints , by introducing a non - linear derivative interaction for the scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> such an additional scalar degree of freedom is called `` galileon . '' </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is inspired by the dgp braneworld , but one can construct a ghost - free model that admits a self - accelerating solution . we perform a fully relativistic analysis of linear perturbations in galileon cosmology . although the galileon model can mimic the background evolution of standard @xmath0cdm cosmology , the behavior of perturbation is quite different . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that there exists a super - horizon growing mode in the metric and galileon perturbations at early times , suggesting that the background is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> a fine - tuning of the initial condition for the galileon fluctuation is thus required in order to promote a desirable evolution of perturbations at early times . assuming the safe initial condition , we then compute the late - time evolution of perturbations and discuss observational implications in galileon cosmology . in particular , we find anticorrelations in the cross - correlation of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect and large scale structure , similar to the normal branch of the dgp model . </S>"
