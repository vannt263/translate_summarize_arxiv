    "enlarging the higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) and studying its phenomenology have been one of the hot subjects for both theoretical and experimental physicists . the primary motivation to enlarge",
    "the sm higgs sector is to solve the naturalness problem , which is essentially how to avoid the quadratic divergence in radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass arising from the sm particle loops .",
    "one of the most attractive solutions to the naturalness problem is provided by the supersymmetry ( susy ) , in which the loop corrections of the sm particles are cancelled by the loop corrections of their superpartners [ 1 - 3 ] . in this context , the susy is regarded as a gateway to new physics at tev scale .    among a number of supersymmetric extensions of the sm ,",
    "the simplest one is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which possesses only two higgs doublets .",
    "the superpotential of the mssm should contain a mixing term between the two higgs doublets , proportional to @xmath1 of tev or lower scale , in order to generate the right size of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 has mass dimension , sometimes regarded as a drawback of the mssm [ 4 ] .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath1 problem of the mssm , which may be solved by introducing an extra higgs singlet in addition to the two higgs doublets of the mssm [ 5,6 ] .",
    "a number of nonminimal supersymmetric standard models have at least one higgs singlet in their higgs sectors , where the parameter @xmath1 of the mssm is replaced in terms of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs singlet field .",
    "these nonminimal supersymmetric standard models may be divided into two classes according to whether their gauge groups contain an additional @xmath0 or not .",
    "a representative example of those models that have no additional @xmath0 may be the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) [ 7 - 15 ] .",
    "the minimal non - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mnmssm ) also has no additional @xmath0 , where the global @xmath2 peccei - quinn symmetry is explicitly broken by means of the tadpole term of the higgs singlet [ 16 - 20 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "there is the @xmath0-extended supersymmetric standard mode ( ussm ) as a typical example of those models that have additional @xmath0 [ 21 - 38 ] .",
    "the ussm may emerge from the superstring - inspired @xmath3 model , which has two additional @xmath2 symmetries besides the sm gauge group .",
    "these two @xmath2 symmetries are linearly mixed to yield the desired @xmath0 , where the mixing angle is denoted as @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath5 , the ussm is called as the @xmath6-model .",
    "similarly , it is called the @xmath7-model for @xmath8 , the @xmath9-model for @xmath10 , and the @xmath11-model for @xmath12 .",
    "a characteristic of the superstring - inspired @xmath3 model is that it possesses naturally an extra pair of @xmath13 singlet quarks , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with electric charge @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "these exotic quarks are introduced in order to fill in the fundamental 27 representation of @xmath3 .",
    "they may participate in the ussm phenomenology , if they are sufficiently light .    at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the dominant production mechanism for the sm higgs boson with a mass below 1",
    "tev is the gluon fusion process which is mediated through a top quark loop [ 39 - 42 ] .",
    "this production depends directly on the coupling of the higgs boson to a top quark pair . in the same manner",
    ", the light exotic quarks of the ussm may take part in the higgs productions at the lhc .",
    "we study in this article the higgs productions of the ussm at the lhc via gluon fusion process through the exotic quark loop at the leading order .",
    "the masses and the mixing matrix of the neutral scalar higgs bosons are calculated using the effective potential approximation at the one - loop level , by considering radiative corrections due to the top quarks , bottom quarks , exotic quarks and their superparticles . for the gluon fusion process",
    ", both the top quark loop and the exotic quark loop are studied for the productions of the neutral scalar higgs bosons in the ussm .",
    "it is found that the lightest neutral scalar higgs boson in the ussm may couple dominantly to a top quark pair when the relevant parameters have certain values . in this case ,",
    "the lightest scalar higgs boson would produce dominantly through the gluon fusion process via a top - quark loop at the lhc .",
    "at the same time ,",
    "one of two heavier scalar higgs bosons couples strongly to an exotic - quark pair because of an orthogonality of the transformation matrix . in this scenario ,",
    "the gluon - fusion process via an exotic - quark loop on the production of the heavier scalar higgs boson is more dominant mechanism than that via a top - quark loop .",
    "the higgs sector of the ussm consist of two higgs doublets , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and a neutral higgs singlet , @xmath20 .",
    "there are therefore ten real degrees of freedom . for simplicity , we take only the third generation of quarks into account . then , the superpotential for the yukawa interactions in the ussm for quarks and the exotic quarks may be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an antisymmetric @xmath23 matrix with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the dimensionless yukawa coupling coefficients of top , bottom , and exotic quarks , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the right - handed top and bottom quark superfields , respectively , @xmath30 is the left - handed @xmath13 doublet quark superfield of the third generation , and the right and left handed singlet exotic quark superfields are denoted respectively as @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    the higgs potential at the tree level may be collected from the on - shell lagrangian as @xmath33 where @xmath34   \\ , \\cr v_d & = & { g_2 ^ 2 \\over 8 } ( h_1^{\\dagger } \\vec\\sigma h_1 + h_2^{\\dagger } \\vec\\sigma h_2)^2 + { g_1 ^ 2 \\over 8 } ( |h_1|^2 - |h_2|^2)^2 \\cr & & \\mbox{}+ { g_1'^2 \\over 2 } ( { \\tilde q}_1 |h_1|^2 + { \\tilde q}_2 |h_2|^2 + { \\tilde q}_3 |s|^2)^2 \\ , \\cr v_{\\rm s } & = & m_1 ^ 2 |h_1|^2 + m_2 ^ 2 |h_2|^2 + m_3 ^ 2 |s|^2 - [ \\lambda",

    "these three effective @xmath0 hypercharges should satisfy @xmath45 , since the superpotential should be invariant under @xmath0 .",
    "the higgs potential also introduces three soft masses , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , which can eventually be eliminated by requiring the minimum conditions for the vevs .",
    "the vevs of the three neutral higgs fields are denoted as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the parameters of the higgs potential as well as the vevs of the three neutral higgs fields are assumed to be real , since we do not consider the cp mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons in this article .    at the tree level ,",
    "the masses of stop , sbottom , and exotic squarks ( @xmath51 ) are respectively given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "also , the masses of top , bottom , and the exotic quarks ( @xmath54 ) at the tree level are respectively given by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath38 is generally the order of @xmath37 , and the @xmath58 does not contribute to the squark masses .",
    "we assume that the soft susy - breaking masses for the left and right squarks are same .",
    "the higgs potential of the ussm at the one - loop level may be obtained by including the radiative corrections due to quarks and squarks of the third generation , and the exotic quarks and squarks . in general , the radiative corrections due to the exotic quarks and squarks can be significant since the yukawa couplings of the exotic quarks to the higgs bosons can be large at the electroweak scale .",
    "the one - loop effective potential is given as [ 43 ] @xmath59   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the renormalization scale in the modified minimal subtraction scheme , and the subscript @xmath61 stands for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 as well as @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the degrees of freedom for these quarks and squarks are @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "therefore , the full higgs potential at the one - loop level is given as @xmath74 .",
    "the ten real degrees of freedom of the higgs sector of the ussm is linearly combined to yield two neutral goldstone bosons , a pair of charged goldstone bosons , four neutral higgs bosons and a pair of charged higgs bosons .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the four goldstone bosons , neutral and charged , would eventually be absorbed into the longitudinal component of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 gauge bosons , where @xmath76 is the additional neutral gauge boson of the ussm .",
    "note that we have definite cp parities for the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "thus , as physical higgs bosons , the ussm has one neutral pseudoscalar higgs boson , three neutral scalar higgs bosons , and a pair of the charged higgs bosons .    at the one - loop level ,",

    "they are obtained from @xmath92 .",
    "explicitly , the elements of the mass matrix for the three neutral scalar higgs bosons at the tree level are obtained as @xmath93    from @xmath92 , we obtain the one - loop contributions from the top quark sector , @xmath94 , as @xmath95 where @xmath96 and the dimensionless function @xmath97 is defined as @xmath98    likewise , we obtain the one - loop contributions from the bottom quark sector , @xmath99 , as @xmath100 where @xmath101 and we obtain the one - loop contributions from the exotic quark sector , @xmath102 , as @xmath103 where @xmath104 note that similar calculations have been performed for the case of explicit cp violation elsewhere to obtain the mass matrix for the neutral higgs bosons in the ussm , which depends on cp phases . if the cp phases be zero , the above results are consistent with the previous article [ 32 ] .    in order to obtain analytical expressions for the eigenvalues of @xmath83 , one has to solve a complicated cubic equation .",
    "we sort the masses of the scalar higgs bosons on increasing order such that @xmath105 , where @xmath106 ( @xmath47 ) are three neutral scalar higgs bosons in the ussm , and @xmath107 ( @xmath47 ) are their corresponding masses . the orthogonal transformation matrix , @xmath108 , which is related to the eigenvalues of @xmath83 as @xmath109 , with the orthogonal condition , @xmath110 .",
    "the upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass at the one - loop level may be obtained analytically by observing that the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix is smaller than the smaller eigenvalue of its upper - left @xmath23 submatrix [ 8 ] .",
    "thus , we have @xmath111 where the first three terms come from @xmath88 while the remaining terms come from @xmath92 .",
    "note that there is no explicit appearance of the renormalization scale in the above formula for the upper bound on the lightest scalar higgs boson mass , but it may depend on the renormalization scale implicitly through other relevant parameters .      at the lhc",
    ", it is expected that signals for the sm higgs boson would be produced copiously .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for the sm higgs boson is the gluon fusion process , where a pair of gluons are fused into a triangular shaped fermion loop that would eventually decay into the sm higgs boson , @xmath112 .",
    "it may be described as @xmath113 the role of the fermion loop is to mediate the couplings between the gluon pair and the sm higgs boson . for the sm ,",
    "the gluon fusion process is in effect activated by the top quark loops alone , since the coupling between the sm higgs boson and other fermions are negligible as compared to the coupling between the sm higgs boson and top quark .    in supersymmetric models",
    ", other fermions may take part in the gluon fusion process to produce the scalar higgs bosons .",
    "for example , in the mssm , the coupling between the lightest neutral scalar higgs boson and bottom quark can be strong for large @xmath114 , and thus the gluon fusion process via bottom quark loop may be enhanced .",
    "the ussm has additional fermions , that is , the exotic quarks . in principle",
    ", the exotic quarks also may take part in the gluon fusion process . in practice",
    ", it depends on their masses if the exotic quarks can play a dominant role or not .",
    "for certain values for relevant parameters of the ussm , the exotic quarks may have masses comparable to the electroweak scale , and in this case the production of scalar higgs bosons through the gluon fusion process via the exotic quark loop may become important for higgs search at the lhc .",
    "let us consider in more detail this possibility .",
    "the gluon fusion process in the ussm at the lhc may also be described as @xmath115 where @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) are the neutral scalar higgs bosons in the ussm .",
    "the relevant parts of interaction lagrangian between the neutral scalar higgs bosons and top , bottom , and the exotic quark pairs are given as @xmath118 where @xmath119 are the elements of the orthogonal transformation matrix that diagonalizes @xmath83 , the mass matrix for the neutral scalar higgs bosons .",
    "thus , the coupling coefficients of the neutral scalar higgs bosons to relevant quark pairs are easily obtained as @xmath120 in terms of these coupling coefficients , the cross section for production of the neutral scalar higgs bosons at the lhc through the gluon fusion process via relevant quark loops can be calculated .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the exotic quarks .",
    "let us study the gluon fusion process where the exotic quark loops are involved .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are taken to be the neutral scalar higgs boson mass . at parton level",
    ", two gluons are annihilated into a neutral scalar higgs boson via the exotic quark loop .",
    "the leading - order calculation for the gluon - gluon annihilation into @xmath116 ( @xmath121 ) yields @xmath122 \\right|^2 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the square of the c.m .",

    "thus , the desired cross section at hadronic level is obtained by integrating the cross section at parton level over the gluon luminosity [ 44,45 ] as @xmath130 where @xmath131 tev is the c.m .",
    "energy of the proton - proton system at the lhc , @xmath132 is the gluon distribution function at the factorization scale @xmath133 , and @xmath134 is the momentum fraction .",
    "similarly , @xmath135 is the gluon distribution function for the other gluon .",
    "note that @xmath136 ( @xmath121 ) are explicit functions of @xmath133 .",
    "also , they depend directly upon @xmath137 . likewise ,",
    "if we suitably replace exotic quarks by top quarks , we may calculate @xmath138 ( @xmath121 ) , which are the cross sections of the @xmath116 productions in proton - proton collisions through gluon fusion process via top quark loop .",
    "for numerical analysis , we need to set the values of relevant parameters in the ussm .",
    "the masses of the third generation are set as @xmath139 = 175 gev and @xmath140 = 4 gev . for the mass of the exotic quark with electric charges @xmath141 , the run 1 data from tevatron",
    "have set the lower bound as 190 gev [ 46 ] .",
    "recently , the search for long - lived charged massive particles at tevatron run i data put a more stringent experimental lower bound of 180 gev on the exotic quark mass at the 95 % confidence level [ 47 ] .",
    "we would like to set @xmath142 = 400 gev for our analysis .",
    "since the effective @xmath0 charges @xmath143 always go together with the @xmath0 gauge coupling constant [ 33 ] , let us define the modified @xmath0 charges as @xmath144 .",
    "they satisfy @xmath145 , which can easily be seen from the @xmath0 gauge invariance condition @xmath146 .",
    "the modified @xmath0 charges receive strong experimental constraints from the experimental bounds on the extra gauge boson mass @xmath147 and on the mixing angle between the two neutral gauge boson @xmath148 . in this article",
    ", we set the values of the modified @xmath0 charges as @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 , which are picked up from the experimentally allowed area in the ( @xmath152)-plane by using @xmath153 gev and @xmath154 [ 33 ] .    the other parameters are set as @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 gev , and @xmath158 gev .",
    "we allow the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass may vary within @xmath159 .",
    "the numerical integrations are performed through the gauss integration function of the cern program library . for the gluon distribution functions , we use the pdf library of the cteq6 m [ 40,41 ] . for the above set of parameter values , we have @xmath160 gev .",
    "it is roughly stable against the variation in the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass .",
    "the masses of the other two neutral scalar higgs bosons are estimated to be @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "we note that the upper bound on @xmath163 is estimated to be about 156 gev as we explore reasonable ranges of the parameter space in the ussm with the susy breaking scale of 1 tev .",
    "this value of the upper bound on @xmath163 at the one - loop level may be compared with that of the mssm , where the upper bound on the mass of the lighter one of two neutral scalar higgs bosons is about 135 gev .",
    "let us introduce for convenience @xmath164 and @xmath165 as @xmath166 where @xmath62 and @xmath64 stand for top quark and the exotic quark , respectively .",
    "these two coefficients are directly proportional to @xmath138 and @xmath167 , respectively .",
    "also , they are proportional to the coupling coefficients of @xmath116 to top quarks and the exotic quarks . therefore , by analyzing the behavior of these coefficients , we may study the possibility of the productions of the neutral scalar higgs bosons in the ussm at the lhc .",
    "it is observed that @xmath168 couples strongly to a top quark pair if its mass is large .",
    "thus , for @xmath169 in our case , we have @xmath170 . in an extreme case for example",
    "where @xmath171 , one would have @xmath172 where @xmath173 , due to the orthogonality of the transformation matrix @xmath108 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath174 , and @xmath175 as well as @xmath176 , whereas @xmath177 .",
    "in other words , @xmath178 would be large , and @xmath179 would be comparably large .",
    "however , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .    in fig . 1 , we plot @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( @xmath121 ) as functions of the scalar higgs boson masses .",
    "the figure is actually a composition of three separate pieces : the left piece of the figure shows @xmath182 and @xmath183 as functions of @xmath163 ; the middle one shows @xmath184 and @xmath185 as functions of @xmath186 ; and the right one shows @xmath187 and @xmath188 as functions of @xmath189 . since @xmath160 gev for the whole parameter ranges we consider , @xmath182 and @xmath183 are shown as short vertical line segments .",
    "we see that @xmath182 is effectively 1 whereas @xmath190 .    on the other hand , as @xmath186 varies from 200 gev to 788 gev , the plots of @xmath184 and @xmath185 exhibit wide variations .",
    "notice in fig .",
    "1 that @xmath185 increases from about @xmath191 to practically 1 , while @xmath184 decreases from about @xmath192 to zero .",
    "the cross over occurs at @xmath193 gev .",
    "that is , @xmath194 for @xmath195 gev .",
    "similarly , as @xmath189 varies from 793 gev to 1000 gev , the plots of @xmath187 and @xmath188 also vary widely .",
    "the size of @xmath187 stays below @xmath192 while @xmath188 changes from 1 down to about @xmath192 .",
    "we see that @xmath196 , but one may be larger than the other , depending on the values of parameters . for the whole range of @xmath189 , we have @xmath197 .    in fig .",
    "2 , we plot @xmath198 and @xmath136 ( @xmath121 ) as functions of the scalar higgs boson masses . fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 look alike , since both @xmath199 s and @xmath200 s depend essentially on @xmath119 s , but details are somewhat different .",
    "1 , this figure is also a composition of three separate pieces .",
    "the left piece of the figure shows @xmath201 and @xmath202 as functions of @xmath163 ; the middle one shows @xmath203 and @xmath204 as functions of @xmath186 ; and the right one shows @xmath205 and @xmath206 as functions of @xmath189 .    for @xmath168 productions at the lhc ,",
    "the gluon fusion process via top quark loop is definitely dominant over the process via the exotic quark loop , for the whole parameter ranges we consider .",
    "we see that @xmath207 fb whereas @xmath202 is negligibly less than 2 fb for @xmath160 gev . on the other hand , for @xmath208 and @xmath209 productions at the lhc ,",
    "the gluon fusion process via the exotic quark loop may be comparable to or more dominant over the process via top quark loop , for some parameter ranges . in fig .",
    "2 , one can see that @xmath210 for @xmath211 gev .",
    "the most interesting case is the @xmath209 productions . for the whole parameter",
    "ranges we consider , i.e. , for the whole range of @xmath189 from 793 gev to 1000 gev , we have @xmath206 is larger than @xmath205 .",
    "it is remarkable that both @xmath204 and @xmath206 may be as large as 0.05 pb , depending on the parameter values .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath116 productions in the ussm may be compared with the mssm higgs searches .",
    "there are two neutral scalar higgs bosons , denoted as @xmath212 and @xmath213 , in the mssm , some years ago , spira and his colleagues have calculated the production cross sections of these neutral scalar higgs bosons through the gluon fusion process for @xmath214 by including some qcd corrections to the production process and by considering the two - loop corrections to the mssm higgs sector [ 40,41 ] . the result for the @xmath212 production cross section is 80 pb for @xmath215 80 gev , and the results for the @xmath213 production cross sections are 10 pb for @xmath216 gev , 0.02 pb for @xmath217 gev , and 0.05 pb for @xmath218 gev .",
    "compared with these numbers , the results of our numerical analysis indicate that the lhc may be possible to compare the predictions between the mssm and the ussm , and test experimentally the contributions of the exotic quarks to the productions of the neutral scalar higgs bosons in the ussm through the gluon fusion process",
    ".    one might argue that our numerical numerical analysis is based on a specific choice of parameters .",
    "however , it may well be expected that the contribution of the exotic quarks to the production of one of the heavier neutral scalar higgs bosons may be equal to , or larger than , the contribution of the top quarks , for a wide parameter space .",
    "the stringent bounds on the @xmath75-@xmath76 mixing require the parameter @xmath219 to be rather as large as 500 gev .",
    "therefore , one of the neutral scalar higgs bosons is predominantly su(2)-singlet , and its coupling to top quarks is suppressed . since , at the same time , we choose a large value for the yukawa coupling of the higgs singlet to the exotic quarks as @xmath220 , it is not surprising at all that the exotic quarks give a sizeable contribution to the production of the scalar higgs boson that is predominantly singlet .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to emphasize the exotic quark effects on the scalar higgs productions via the gluon fusion process . for experimental examinations of these effects ,",
    "the higgs decay modes in the ussm need to be investigated in detail , since the decay of the higgs boson into a gluon pair is affected by the exotic quarks through their triangular loop .",
    "comprehensive investigations are under way . here",
    ", we would like to make a few preliminary remarks .",
    "the higgs decay into a fermion pair is usually more dominant if the fermion is heavier , since the coupling of the higgs bosons to a fermion pair is proportional to the fermion mass .",
    "thus , the higgs decay into a pair of bottom quarks is most dominant for a wide area of the relevant parameter space if the higgs boson is lighter than 130 gev , and the higgs decay into a pair of gauge bosons is more dominant than the other decay modes if the higgs boson is heavier than 130 gev .    in the ussm",
    ", the coupling of the higgs boson to a fermion pair also significantly depends on @xmath114 and @xmath119 , besides the fermion mass . in our numerical analysis",
    ", the higgs decays into a fermion pair depend weakly on @xmath114 , as we take an intermediate value for it:@xmath221 .",
    "however , the dependence of the higgs decays into a fermion pair on @xmath119 still persists .",
    "since @xmath170 and the coupling of the lightest scalar higgs boson to a pair of bottom quarks is small , @xmath222 , for the parameter region we consider , the coupling of the lightest scalar higgs boson to a pair of charm quarks would be stronger than that to a pair of bottom quarks , therefore , in the parameter region we consider , where the mass of the lightest scalar higgs boson is around 138 gev , the lightest scalar higgs boson might dominantly decay into a pair of charm quarks or a pair of @xmath77 bosons .",
    "the higgs decays into a gluon pair is generally not negligible if the higgs boson mass is around 138 gev . for the lightest scalar higgs boson ,",
    "the effect of the exotic quarks through the triangular loop is not significant at all , since @xmath223 is @xmath224 times as small as @xmath225 as one can easily notice in fig .",
    "thus , the decay of the lightest scalar higgs boson via the triangular loop of exotic quark into a gluon pair is negligible . for the heavier scalar higgs bosons , their decays into a gluon pair via the triangular loop of the exotic quark is considerably significant since @xmath226 ( @xmath227 ) is comparable with @xmath228 .",
    "it is always important , as well as interesting , to distinguish the higgs bosons in the ussm from those in such models as the sm or the mssm .",
    "we expect that it is rather easy to distinguish the lightest scalar higgs boson in the ussm from the sm higgs boson , in the parameter region we consider , since the decay patterns between them are very different .",
    "the sm higgs boson exhibits that it decays more dominantly into a pair of bottom quarks than into a pair of charm quarks . on the other hand ,",
    "the lightest scalar higgs boson in the ussm shows an opposite decay pattern , in the parameter region we consider .",
    "however , distinguishing the lightest scalar higgs boson in the ussm from the corrsponding one in the mssm might be very difficult , if their decay patterns are similar . in this case , the search for the heavier higgs bosons would be useful in order to distinguish the ussm from the mssm .",
    "in particular , as fig",
    ". 1 shows , the decay modes of the heaviest scalar higgs boson via the triangular loop of exotic quarks into a gluon pair in the ussm might be strong because @xmath229 is comparable with @xmath230 .",
    "the qualitative results of our analysis remains the same if we choose other parameter sets . to be specific ,",
    "let us take @xmath231 and @xmath232 for the modified @xmath0 charges of the higgs doublets and singlet , instead of @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( @xmath233 ) which lead to fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 , these values for @xmath234 and @xmath235 are consistent with the experimental constraints on both @xmath236 and @xmath147 , for @xmath237 gev and @xmath221 .    for these values of @xmath231 and @xmath232 , where the values of other parameters are the same as in figs . 1 and 2 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath238 and @xmath239 ( @xmath240 ) , which are plotted respectively in figs . 3 and 4 as functions of the scalar higgs boson masses .",
    "one may notice that the exotic quark as light as 400 gev might be able to play an important role in the productions of the heavier scalar higgs bosons via the gluon fusion process .",
    "the higgs sector of the ussm is studied at the one - loop level by taking into account radiative corrections due to top , bottom , and the exotic quarks , and their superpartners , in order to examine the possibility of discovering one of the neutral scalar higgs bosons in the ussm at the lhc .",
    "a characteristic difference of the ussm from the mssm is that there are exotic quarks in the ussm .",
    "if the masses of these exotic quarks are a few hundred gev , it would be difficult to see direct signals of them at the lhc .",
    "however , they may manifest themselves as intermediate states in the production processes of other particles . a clear candidate may be the gluon fusion process for the production of the neutral scalar higgs bosons , where fermion loops are engaged as intermediate states . in the sm , as well as in the mssm ,",
    "the gluon fusion process is predominantly activated by a top quark loop . in the ussm , it is possible that the exotic quark loop may also be involved , and the contributions of the exotic quark loop to the gluon fusion process may be significant as compared to the contributions due to top quark loop .    indeed , the possibility depends on the values of the relevant parameters of the ussm .",
    "the parameter region we explore are @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 gev , and @xmath158 gev .",
    "the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson of the ussm , @xmath241 , is allowed to vary from 200 gev to 1000 gev , and the mass of the exotic quark @xmath142 is set as 400 gev . all parameters and vevs",
    "are assumed to be real . in this parameter region , the masses of the three neutral scalar higgs bosons of the ussm at the one - loop level are estimated to be @xmath160 gev , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "these masses lie within the experimentally allowed bound set by the lep ii data as well as the tevatron data [ 48 - 50 ] .",
    "the result of our analysis on the productions of these neutral scalar higgs bosons shows that the exotic quarks in the ussm are competitively important for the gluon fusion process . for @xmath168 productions , the gluon fusion process via top quark loop yields",
    "exceedingly larger cross sections than the one via the exotic quark loop , for the parameter region we consider . however , we find that , for @xmath208 productions , the gluon fusion process via the exotic quark loop may yield larger cross sections than the one via top quark loop , when @xmath208 becomes more massive than 710 gev . for @xmath209 productions ,",
    "exotic quarks are more important than top quark for the gluon fusion process , for the entire parameter region we explore .    in conclusion , the exotic quarks in the ussm may help the neutral scalar higgs bosons in the same model to be discovered through gluon fusion process at the lhc . to discover a neutral scalar higgs boson at the lhc and identify it as the ussm one would be very supporting evidences for supersymmetry and @xmath3 gauge group , as well as a strong constraint upon the parameter space of the ussm .    0.3 in 0.2 in this work",
