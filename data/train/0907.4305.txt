    "a bose - einstein condensate is flowing along a one - dimensional atomic waveguide .",
    "for simplicity , the transverse trapping is assumed to be tight enough for a one - dimensional description to be accurate .",
    "the flow velocity is directed along the positive-@xmath0 direction , @xmath1 .",
    "the density profile @xmath2 and/or velocity field @xmath3 of the condensate show a significant spatial modulation in the region around @xmath4 .",
    "far from this interface region , both the density and the flow velocity tend to their up - stream ( @xmath5 ) and down - stream ( @xmath6 ) asymptotic values @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the flow is kept stationary in time by means of a suitable external potential @xmath9 and/or spatial modulation of the atom - atom interaction constant @xmath10 , so that the condensate wavefunction @xmath11 is a solution of the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath12\\,\\psi_0=\\mu\\,\\psi_0,\\ ] ] at a chemical potential @xmath13 .",
    "a dumb - hole configuration is realized when the up - stream region is subsonic @xmath14 and the down - stream region is instead super - sonic @xmath15 .",
    "here , @xmath16 is the speed of sound and @xmath17 are the asymptotic values of the interaction constant in the @xmath18-regions , respectively . for later purposes",
    ", we also introduce the corresponding upstream ( downstream ) healing length @xmath19 , chemical potential @xmath20 , and condensate wave - vector @xmath21 .    in this dumb - hole configuration a sound wave emitted in the down - stream region is dragged away by the flow without being able to reach the up - stream region .",
    "the down - stream region is thus the sonic analog of the interior of a gravitational black hole , and the transition point where the velocity of the flow is exactly equal to the speed of sound is the analog of the event horizon .",
    "we conventionally locate this point at @xmath4 .",
    "provided the condensate is everywhere dilute @xmath22 , small fluctuations on top of the condensate can be described by the bogoliubov theory of dilute condensates  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the elementary excitations correspond to the eigenvectors of the bogoliubov operator : @xmath23      within each homogeneous @xmath24 , @xmath25 region far from the interface , the eigenvectors of operator ( [ eq : l ] ) at an eigenenergy @xmath26 are plane waves of the form @xmath27 the wavevector @xmath28 and frequency @xmath29 satisfy the bogoliubov dispersion relation @xmath30 with @xmath31 as usual in bogoliubov theory  @xcite , the upper ( lower ) sign in eq .",

    "these modes correspond to propagating plane waves . in the bogoliubov dispersion shown in fig.[fig : disp ] ( left panel ) , they correspond to the branches indicated as @xmath24-in and @xmath24-out . throughout the whole paper",

    "in addition to the positive norm modes , a second pair of negative norm of modes exist with complex wavevectors satisfying the bogoliubov equation @xmath40 : these correspond to exponentially growing or decreasing evanescent waves  @xcite .    in the down - stream super - sonic region ,",
    "two positive - norm real solutions of the bogoliubov dispersion at @xmath41 and @xmath42 exist for any @xmath33 : in the bogoliubov dispersion of fig.[fig : disp ] ( right panel ) , these wavevectors correspond to the @xmath43-in and @xmath43-out branches . on the other hand ,",
    "two cases have to be distinguished in the negative norm sector , depending on whether @xmath29 is larger or smaller than the critical value @xmath44 with @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 a pair of real solutions @xmath47 and @xmath48 to the negative - norm dispersion relation @xmath40 exist as long as @xmath49 and correspond to the @xmath50-in and @xmath50-out branches of fig.[fig : disp ] ( right panel ) .",

    "these real solutions are again replaced by a pair of complex solutions corresponding to evanescent waves .",
    "of course , the @xmath50 branches do not exist if the condensate flow is everywhere sub - sonic .      far from the interface , the generic eigenfunction of the bogoliubov operator ( [ eq : l ] ) at a frequency @xmath29",
    "is built by superimposing within each @xmath24 , @xmath25 region all available propagating ( that is non - evanescent ) plane waves at the given frequency @xmath29 : @xmath53 here , plane waves have been separated into in - going ( in ) and out - going ( out ) ones according to the sign of their group velocity .",
    "most remarkable among these solutions are the so - called scattering solutions , that describe a plane - wave excitation originating from infinity ( either upstream or downstream ) on a well defined in - going mode , impinging on the horizon , and then leaving again towards infinity as a superposition of the different out - going branches : only a single in - going @xmath54 amplitude is then non - vanishing , while two ( if @xmath52 ) or three ( if @xmath49 ) out - going @xmath55 components have a finite value , describing reflected and transmitted waves .    as a specific example , in the case where the in - going @xmath56 wave originates from the down - stream region , the scattering solution has the form @xmath57 in the down - stream region and the form @xmath58 in the up - stream region .",

    "( [ scat_d ] ) correspond to the reflected part in respectively the @xmath43 and @xmath50 channels ; of course , a @xmath50 component can only be present if @xmath49 .",
    "on the other hand , only a single outgoing transmitted component is present in the upstream region .",
    "similar expressions can be straightforwardly written in the case where the in - going @xmath24-in wave originates from the up - stream region .",
    "the expressions ( [ scat_d ] ) and ( [ scat_u ] ) based on the plane - wave expansion are only valid in the asymptotic regions far from the interface . for any given realization of the dumb - hole configuration the complete scattering solution for all",

    "was presented in  @xcite . an analytical solution for a simplest step - like case",
    "will be presented in sec.[slg ] .",
    "in general , the linear relation between the amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 of in- and out - going waves can be written in a compact matricial form  @xcite . in the case of a generic flow that remains sub - sonic in both asymptotic regions , as well as for @xmath52 in a dumb - hole configuration",
    ", this relation has the two - by - two form : @xmath59 which only involves positive - norm modes . on the other hand",
    ", the negative - norm @xmath50 mode appears as soon as frequencies @xmath49 are considered . in this case , the matricial relation has the three - by - three form : @xmath60 with the chosen normalization of the solution ( [ eq : modes ] ) , the @xmath61 matrix connecting the @xmath62 coefficients in the asymptotic regions is unitary in the bogoliubov metric @xmath63 inherited by the norm of the corresponding plane - wave modes @xmath64 more specifically , @xmath65 in the case @xmath49 , whereas @xmath63 is just the standard @xmath66 identity matrix @xmath67 for @xmath52 .    physically , the square moduli @xmath68 of the @xmath61-matrix elements give the trasmission / reflection coefficients for a @xmath69-ingoing mode which scatters into an @xmath70-outgoing mode .",
    "the property ( [ eq : eta ] ) ensures total energy conservation .",
    "it is interesting to note that a closely related approach was used in the context of quantum evaporation from superfluid @xmath71he  @xcite .    as an illustrative example , for each quantum that incides on the system from the @xmath43 in - going mode with an energy @xmath72 , one has @xmath73 transmitted quanta in the @xmath24-out mode , @xmath74 reflected quanta in the @xmath43-out mode , and @xmath75 quanta reflected in the @xmath50-out mode .",
    "while the energy of the transmitted @xmath24-out and reflected @xmath43-out quanta is positive and equal to @xmath72 , the energy of a quantum of the @xmath50-out bogoliubov mode is negative and equal to @xmath76  @xcite . as a result , energy conservation then recovers the unitarity condition @xmath77 .",
    "all the theory reviewed so far is not limited to a particular realization of dumb - hole and can be applied to generic configurations as long as the density and flow velocity tend to constant values in the asymptotic regions far from the interface . a numeric solution for a smooth interface",

    "this model configuration has the remarkable advantage of allowing for analytical insight without having to solve any differential equation . in a future publication we will present the analysis of other realistic dumb - hole configurations @xcite .    in the step like geometry",
    ", the expressions ( [ scat_d ] ) and ( [ scat_u ] ) for the scattering solution can be extended to the whole @xmath87 and @xmath88 regions simply by including evanescent modes as well  @xcite .",
    "a complete scattering solution is then formed by the superposition of five two dimensional column vectors of the form ( [ bog ] ) : one of these corresponds to the incoming ( @xmath89 ) mode and the four others are outgoing waves ( two reflected and two transmitted ) . depending on the value of @xmath29 , some of the outgoing waves may be evanescent : in this case , between the two conjugate complex wavevectors that solve the bogoliubov dispersion ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) , only the wavevector value giving an exponentially decaying wave at large distance from the horizon has to be considered .    across the step - structure at @xmath4 the column vector eigenfunction of @xmath90 and",

    "the @xmath131 contribution is hardly visible . ]",
    "a quantitative comparison of the prediction ( [ eq : g2relevant ] ) with the numerical results is illustrated in fig.[fig : mc ] where cuts of the density correlation function along the line @xmath170 ( marked by a white dashed line in fig.[fig : g2newmc ] ) are shown using the same set of parameters as in ref.@xcite . in spite of the approximations made , the agreement is remarkable .    the accurateness of hydrodynamical approximation ( [ eq : g2app ] ) is finally validated in fig.[cutud2 ] . as shown in the main panel , the agreement for the @xmath171 feature is quite good even though the hydrodynamic approximation is not fully able to reproduce the asymmetry of the peak nor its slightly back - shifted position with respect to the straight line ( [ eq : straight ] ) .",
    "both these facts can be traced back to the quick deviation from a linear dispersion that is visible in fig.[fig : disp ] ( right panel ) for the @xmath50 bogoliubov branch .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by the excellent agreement which is instead found for the @xmath146 contribution ( inset ( a ) of fig.[cutud2 ] ) : the discrepancy of the dispersions of both the @xmath24 and the @xmath43 modes from the hydrodynamic approximation is in fact very small in the whole frequency range up to @xmath172 .     along the @xmath173 line .",
    "black solid lines are the prediction of ( [ eq : g2relevant ] ) and ( [ eq : g2relevantii ] ) .",

    ", a single contribution appears that originates from the correlation between the @xmath43 and the @xmath50 modes , @xmath176 even though it did not appear in the analytical calculations of  @xcite based on the gravitational analogy , this contribution was observed and discussed in the numerical paper  @xcite .",
    "the same hydrodynamical approximation that led to ( [ eq : g2app ] ) can be used to obtain an approximate expression to this @xmath132 feature as well . for small @xmath29 ,",
    "the @xmath177-matrix product can be expanded as @xmath178 with @xmath179 extrapolating this expression to the whole @xmath29 spectrum and cutting the integral at @xmath51 , one immediately gets to the expression @xmath180      one of the major issues in view of an experimental observation of the analog hawking radiation is the role of temperature . to this purpose ,",
    "a naive , but extremely constraining requirement is often imposed that the temperature of the system should be ( much ) smaller than the hawking temperature of the emission .",
    "the numerical simulations of @xcite have instead shown that correlations are robust with respect to temperature , which supports once more their promise in view of an actual experiment . in the present section we extend the theory of correlations developed in the previous section to the case of a condensate at a finite initial temperature .    in particular , we focus our attention on the same _ dynamical _ situation already considered in  @xcite : the condensate initially has a uniform density @xmath181 , flow velocity @xmath182 and sound velocity @xmath183 and is at thermal equilibrium in the moving frame at a temperature @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "the horizon is then ( adiabatically ) switched on by ramping down the scattering length in the downstream region .    within each semi - infinite uniform region , the population of each @xmath28 mode",
    "is adiabatically preserved during the formation of the dumb hole . the initial population @xmath185 of each @xmath110 mode at wave vector @xmath186",
    "is given by the thermal population @xmath187^{-1}$ ] corresponding to its frequency @xmath188 in the comoving frame before the creation of the horizon . for each @xmath29 ,",
    "the wavevector @xmath186 of the corresponding in - going mode has to be determined by inverting the relation @xmath189 .",
    "the density correlation function at a finite temperature can then be written as a sum of different terms , @xmath190 \\\\",
    "+ f_{sh}(\\omega , x , x')+f_{nsh}(\\omega , x , x ' ) .",
    "\\label{eq : finitet}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here , @xmath191^{-1}$ ] is the thermal law at a temperature @xmath184 .    the first term in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : finitet ] )",
    "is straightforwardly interpreted as a thermal enhancement of the zero - point signal described in the previous subsection , i.e. a _ stimulated _ hawking emission .",
    "other scattering processes peculiar to the @xmath192 case are responsible for the other contributions , which can be separated in a @xmath130 term due to the presence of a sonic hole , @xmath193 and a @xmath131 term that instead persists even in absence of the sonic hole : @xmath194    in the low-@xmath29 limit the @xmath61-matrix element products involved in the new terms ( [ eq : g2th ] ) and ( [ eq : nsh ] ) tend to finite values @xmath195 while the thermal population is proportional to @xmath93 , @xmath196 combining these two facts , it is immediate to see that in the hydrodynamic approximation the contributions of ( [ eq : g2th ] ) and ( [ eq : nsh ] ) to respectively the @xmath131 and @xmath130 features then the same form as the zero - temperature one ( [ eq : g2app ] ) .    summing up all the terms , the only effect of a finite initial temperature on the @xmath132 feature is a bosonic stimulation factor @xmath197 . in particular",
    ", this feature is not affected by the @xmath198 and @xmath199 terms .",
    "the @xmath130 feature is affected by this multiplicative factor as well as by the additional term @xmath198 : remarkably , the zero - point ( [ eq : g2app ] ) and thermal ( [ eq : g2th ] ) contributions have opposite signs . within the hydrodynamic approximation ,",
    "the ratio of their contributions to the peak correlation signal has the simple expression @xmath200 as usual , the zero - point contribution dominates at low temperature while it is overwhelmed by the thermal one at high temperature . for the parameters used for the finite temperature numerical simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath201 was still the most relevant one .",
    "the effect of the thermal occupation on the @xmath131 feature is even more dramatic .",
    "also in this case , the ( amplified ) zero - point positive feature due to the @xmath146 term in ( [ eq : g2app ] ) and the thermal contribution ( [ eq : nsh ] ) have opposite signs .",
    "as the involved scattering process is not limited to the @xmath49 window , the term ( [ eq : nsh ] ) gets contributions from high frequencies and is for this reason generally larger in magnitude than ( [ eq : g2th ] ) . for this reason",
    ", the zero - point contribution only dominates at very low temperatures and is quickly overwhelmed by the thermal one : this effect is clearly visible when comparing the @xmath201 numerical simulations shown in fig.[fig : mc ] with the finite temperature ones shown in fig.6(a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the flow remains everywhere subsonic , all long - distance features of the density correlation function disappear but for the positive @xmath131 tongue at finite temperature .",
    "this fact was apparent in figs.4(a ) and 6(b ) of ref.@xcite and corresponds within the present formalism to the @xmath199 term .",
    "its physical origin can be traced back to the finite reflectivity of the interface region even in the absence of an horizon and the different initial occupation of the @xmath24 and @xmath43 incident modes .    before concluding , it is important to stress that a different configuration was considered in  @xcite , where the dumb hole was assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in the comoving frame _ after _ completion of the horizon formation process . of course , this configuration can be still described by eq.([eq : finitet ] ) , but the initial populations @xmath202 have to be computed using in ( [ eq : bigomega ] ) the @xmath203 instead of @xmath183 for the downstream region .",
    "in this work we have made use of the bogoliubov theory of dilute bose - einstein condensates to study the analog hawking emission that is emitted by an acoustic black holes .",
    "our framework does not rely on any gravitational analogy and is able to provide closed - form analytical formulas for the emission spectrum and the density correlation function of a simplest step - like configuration .",
    "although the surface gravity is in this case formally infinite , the low - energy part of the emission spectrum still shows a thermal character , but the temperature is found to depend on the microscopic properties of the condensate .",
    "the extension of our theory to the case of a non - vanishing initial temperature is discussed .",
    "we have shown that this general framework is able to quantitatively reproduce the results of first principle numerical calculations  @xcite , and to provide a physical understanding of the various features that appear in the density - density correlation function .",
