    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithms are now essential for the analysis of complex statistical models . in the mcmc universe ,",
    "one of the most widely used class of algorithms is defined by the metropolis - hastings ( mh ) @xcite and its variants .",
    "an important generalization of the standard mh formulation is represented by the multiple - try metropolis ( mtm ) @xcite .",
    "while in the mh formulation one accepts or rejects a single proposed move , the mtm is designed so that the next state of the chain is selected among multiple proposals .",
    "the multiple - proposal setup can be used effectively to explore the sample space of the target distribution and subsequent developments made use of this added flexibility .",
    "for instance , @xcite propose to use antithetic and quasi - monte carlo samples to generate the proposals and to improve the efficiency of the algorithm while @xcite and @xcite apply the multiple - proposal idea to a trans - dimensional setup and combine reversible jump mcmc with mtm .",
    "this work further generalizes the mtm algorithm presented in @xcite in two directions .",
    "first , we show that the original mtm transition kernel can be modified to allow for different proposal distributions in the multiple - try generation step while preserving the ergodicity of the chain .",
    "the use of different proposal distributions gives more freedom in designing mtm algorithms for target distributions that require different proposals across the sample space .",
    "an important challenge remains the choice of the distributions used to generate the proposals and we propose to address it by expanding upon methods used within the population monte carlo class of algorithms .",
    "the class of population monte carlo procedures @xcite has been designed to address the inefficiency of classical mcmc samplers in complex applications involving multimodal and high dimensional target distributions @xcite .",
    "its formulation relies on a number of mcmc processes that are run in parallel while learning from one another about the geography of the target distribution .",
    "a second contribution of the paper is finding reliable generic methods for constructing the proposal distributions for the mtm algorithm.we propose an interacting mcmc sampling design for the mtm that preserves the markovian property . more specifically , in the proposed interacting mtm ( imtm ) algorithm , we allow the distinct proposal distributions to use information produced by a population of auxiliary chains .",
    "we infer that the resulting performance of the mtm is tightly connected to the performance of the chains population . in order to maximize the latter ,",
    "we propose a number of strategies that can be used to tune the auxiliary chains .",
    "we also adapt previous extensions of the mtm and link the use of stochastic overrelaxation , random - ray monte carlo method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and simulated annealing to imtm .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the imtm algorithm , propose a number of alternative implementations and prove their ergodicity . in section 3",
    "we focus on some special cases of the imtm algorithm and in section 4 the performance of the methods proposed is demonstrated with simulations and real examples .",
    "we end the paper with a discussion of future directions for research .",
    "we begin by describing the mtm and its extension for using different proposal distributions .",

    "the mathematical formalization is used in the description of algorithm [ alg3 ] .",
    "one expects that the chains in the population are spread throughout the sample space and thus the proposals generated are a good representation of the sample space @xmath61 ultimately resulting in better mixing for the chain of interest .    in order to give a representation of the imtm transition density",

    "the transition density @xmath76 associated to the @xmath53-th chain of the imtm algorithm satisfies the conditional detailed balanced condition .",
    "see appendix a.    since the transition @xmath76 , @xmath36 has @xmath77 as stationary distribution and satisfies the conditional detailed balance condition then the joint transition @xmath78 has @xmath79 as a stationary distribution .",
    "an important issue directly connected to the practical implementation of the imtm is the choice of proposal distributions and the choice of @xmath80 .",
    "first it should be noted that at each iteration of the interacting chains the computational complexity of the algorithm is @xmath81 . when considering the number of chains and the number of proposals ,",
    "there are two possible strategies in designing the interaction mechanism .",
    "the first strategy is to use a small number of chains , say @xmath82 , in order to improve the mixing of each chain and to allow for large jumps between different regions of the state space . when applying this strategy to our imtm algorithms it is possible to set the number of proposals to be equal to the number of chains , i.e. @xmath83 , for all @xmath84 . in this way",
    "all the chains can interact at each iteration of the algorithm and many search directions can be included among the proposals .",
    "a second strategy is to use a higher number of chains , e.g. @xmath85 , in order to possibly have , at each iteration , a good approximation of the target or a much higher number of search directions for a good exploration of the sample space .",
    "this algorithm design strategy is common in population monte carlo or interacting mcmc methods .",
    "clearly when a high number of chains is used within imtm , it is necessary to set @xmath86 . in the next section",
    "we discuss a few strategies to built the @xmath54 proposals .",
    "one of the strategies that revealed to be successful in our applications consists in the random selection of a certain number of chains of the population in order to build the proposals .",
    "more specifically , we let @xmath87 , for all @xmath53 , and when updating the @xmath53-th chain of the population we sample @xmath88 random indexes from the uniform distribution @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , and then set the proposals : @xmath91 , for all @xmath18 . on the basis of our simulation experiments we found that the following choice @xmath92 is works well in improving the mixing of the chains .    previously suggested forms for the function @xmath80 @xcite are :    1 .",
    "@xmath93 2 .",
    "@xmath94 3 .",
    "@xmath95 , @xmath96 .    here",
    "we propose to include in the choice of @xmath97 the information provided by the population of chains .",
    "therefore we suggest to modify the above functions as follows    1 .",
    "@xmath98 2 .",
    "@xmath99 3 .",
    "@xmath100 , @xmath96    where the factor @xmath101 captures the behaviour of the auxiliary chains at the previous iteration @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the random index of the selection step at the iteration @xmath104 for the @xmath53-th chain .",
    "the modifications proposed for @xmath105 would increase the use of those proposal distributions favoured by the population of chains at previous iteration . since @xmath106 depends only on samples generated at the previous step by the population of chains , the ergodicity of the imtm chain is preserved .",
    "an alternative strategy is to sample the random indexes @xmath88 with probabilities proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "our belief in imtm s improved performance is underpinned by the assumption that the population of monte carlo chains is spread throughout the sample space .",
    "this can be partly achieved by initializing the chains using draws from a distribution overdispersed with respect to @xmath0 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and partly by modifying the stationary distribution for some of the chains in the population .",
    "specifically , we consider the sequence of annealed distributions @xmath107 with @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , for instance @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath111 are close temperatures , @xmath112 is similar to @xmath113 , but @xmath114 may be much harder to sample from than @xmath115 as has been long recognized in the simulated annealing and simulated tempering literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is likely that some of the chains designed to sample from @xmath116 have good mixing properties , making them good candidates for the population of mcmc samplers needed for the imtm .",
    "we thus consider the monte carlo population made of the @xmath117 chains having @xmath118 as stationary distributions .",
    "an example of annealed interacting mtm is given in algorithm [ alg5bis ] .",

    "however , it should be noted that letting the auxiliary chains adapt indefinitely results in complex theoretical justifications for the imtm which go beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere . our current recommendation is to use finite adaptation for the auxiliary chains prior to the start of the imtm .",

    "finally we remark that the gimtm algorithm allows us to introduce further possible choices for the @xmath80 functions .",

    "first we show how to use the stochastic overrelaxation method to possibly have a further gain in the efficiency .",
    "secondly we suggest two possible strategies to built the different proposal functions of the imtm .",
    "the first strategy consists in proposing values along different search directions and represents an extension of the random - ray monte carlo algorithm presented in @xcite .",
    "the second strategy relies upon a suitable combination of target tempering and adaptive mcmc chains .",
    "stochastic overrelaxation ( sor ) is a markov chain monte carlo technique developed by adler ( 1981 ) for normal densities and subsequently extended by green and han ( 1992 ) for non - normal targets .",
    "the idea behind this approach is to induce negative correlation between consecutive draws of a single mcmc process .",
    "within the mtm algorithm we can implement sor by inducing negative correlation between the proposals and between the proposals and the current state of the chain , @xmath2 . a natural and easy to implement procedure",
    "may be based on the assumption that @xmath160 where @xmath161 s structure is dictated by the desired negative dependence between the proposals @xmath162 s and @xmath2 , specifically    @xmath163    for instance , we can set @xmath164 whenever @xmath165 and @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a correlation matrix which corresponds to extreme negative correlation ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the general construction falls within the context of dependent proposals as discussed by @xcite with the additional bonus of `` pulling '' the proposals away from the current state due to the imposed negative correlation .",
    "this essentially ensures that no proposals are exceedingly close to the current location of the chain .",
    "also note that the construction is general enough and can be applied for algorithms 2 and 3 as long as the proposal distributions are gaussian .",
    "we show here that the use of different proposals for the mtm algorithm allows also to extend the random - ray monte carlo method given in @xcite .",
