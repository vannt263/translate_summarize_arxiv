    "over the last years , substantial progress has been made in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite towards a gravity dual description of qcd - like theories , in particular also for theories which involve fields in the fundamental representation of the gauge group , i.e.  quarks @xcite - @xcite .",
    "quark fields in the fundamental representation can be introduced for instance by adding @xmath0-brane probes in addition to the @xmath13-branes responsible for the adjoint degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , supersymmetry can be broken further by turning on additional background fields , i.e. by embedding the branes into less supersymmetric backgrounds . for theories of this kind , holographic descriptions in particular of meson spectra and decay constants @xcite chiral symmetry breaking by quark condensates @xcite - @xcite and thermal phase transitions",
    "@xcite have been found , using a variety of brane constructions in different supergravity backgrounds . in a number of examples",
    ", there is astonishing agreement with experimental results .",
    "there have also been phenomenological ` bottom - up ' approaches inspired by the string - theoretical results @xcite .",
    "moreover from a more theoretical point of view there have been embeddings of brane probes in the klebanov - strassler @xcite and maldacena - nuez @xcite backgrounds @xcite , and progress towards holographic models of flavour beyond the probe approximation has been made @xcite .",
    "all of these holographic models have been perfectioned in a number of respects . however , even if remaining in the supergravity approximation and in the probe limit , there are still aspects which are desirable to improve . for instance , it is desirable to embed a @xmath0-brane probe into a gravity background with a well - controlled infrared behaviour in the interior , which in addition returns to a well - controlled four - dimensional field theory in the ultraviolet near the boundary . as we discuss in this paper ,",
    "this is achieved by embedding a @xmath0-brane probe into the @xmath14 version of the polchinski - strassler background @xcite . the field theory dual to this background",
    "is known as @xmath15 theory and corresponds to giving mass to the adjoint @xmath3 hypermultiplet in the @xmath16 theory .",
    "moreover , intrinsically the models considered for holography with flavour have only one scale parameter , usually associated to the supergravity background , which sets the scale of both supersymmetry breaking and conformal symmetry breaking remains large .",
    "this paragraph merely refers to the fact that the holographic models yield e.g.  meson masses of the order of the susy breaking scale . ] .",
    "generically the observables calculated in these models are also of the order of magnitude of this same scale .",
    "this is unsatisfactory from the phenomenological point of view , since the meson masses , for instance , are known to be much smaller than the susy breaking scale .",
    "a possible approach to separating the two scales ( i.e.  meson masses and susy breaking scale ) may be an appropriately adapted version of the giddings - kachru - polchinski mechanism @xcite in which scales are separated by fluxes . as a precursor to such a mechanism , in this paper we study @xmath17 with flavour in a supergravity background where the symmetry breaking is generated by the @xmath1-form flux @xmath2 .",
    "these are our two main motivations for embedding a @xmath0-brane probe into a suitable form of the polchinski - strassler background .    for embedding a @xmath0-brane probe",
    ", it turns out that a sufficiently symmetric and thus tractable background is the @xmath3 version where two of the adjoint chiral multiplet masses are equal , while the third vanishes .",
    "we consider this background in an expansion in the adjoint masses @xmath18 , @xmath19 to second order . for the @xmath20 case ,",
    "such extensions have been computed in @xcite and to third order in @xcite , which lead to a dynamical formation of a gaugino condensate . here , we modify these results in order to obtain the @xmath15 case with @xmath21 , @xmath22 .    to all orders in the adjoint masses ,",
    "the corresponding supergravity solution has been constructed in @xcite , however without explicit reference to the fluxes .",
    "thus it is a slightly different approach from the one considered here . on the field theory side , the theory corresponding to this background flows to the donagi - witten integrable field theory @xcite in the infrared .",
    "we discuss the structure of our order @xmath23 metric in the deep interior of the space .",
    "we find that two overlapping 2-spheres form whose radius is of order @xmath24 .",
    "denoting the ten dimensions by @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the two spheres form in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions , respectively .",
    "they give rise to an @xmath31 symmetry of the background , which is isomorphic to @xmath32 .",
    "for the @xmath0-brane embedding in the @xmath3 version of polchinski - strassler , we find that these symmetries are sufficient to ensure that the differential equation determining the embedding is ordinary .",
    "this is achieved by embedding the @xmath0-brane probe in the @xmath33 directions which correspond to the adjoint matter with mass @xmath34 in the @xmath35 theory .",
    "the variable @xmath36 given by @xmath37 is then the direction perpendicular to the boundary of the deformed ads space , which may be interpreted as the energy scale .",
    "the background generically breaks the @xmath38 symmetry in the @xmath39 plane perpendicular to the @xmath0-brane .",
    "we find that there are solutions for the embedding for which the angular coordinate in this subspace is constant , such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "another type of solutions has @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "since there is no background two - sphere in the @xmath44 directions , the embeddings of the form @xmath45 are repelled by the singularity at @xmath46 . by applying the methods of holographic renormalization , we confirm that these particular embeddings preserve supersymmetry .",
    "the other type of embedding solutions of the form @xmath47 with @xmath48 feel the effect of the shell of polarized @xmath13-branes forming the background . at small values of the quark mass , they merge with the shell of polarized @xmath13-branes in the deep interior of the space .",
    "these embeddings are supersymmetric too .",
    "although both of the above embeddings have similar behaviour , the fields living on their worldvolumes are different .",
    "the pullback of @xmath49 induces source terms in the equations of motion for @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath50 lives on the four - dimensional brane volume transverse to @xmath25 , the equations of motion derived from the combined dirac - born - infeld and chern - simons action only contain the primitive @xmath51 components of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , there must not appear source terms for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 components .",
    "in other words , the field strength components @xmath54_{2,0}+p[b]_{0,2})$ ] along the @xmath0-brane directions derived from the @xmath52 and @xmath53 components of @xmath49 must vanish .",
    "this is a constraint on the embedding . in the @xmath55 case , for our choices of the embedding , @xmath56_{(2,0)}$ ] and @xmath56_{(0,2)}$ ] vanish themselves and do not give non - trivial constraints . in @xcite",
    "the absence of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 components was found as a condition for supersymmetry to be preserved .",
    "finally , for the embedding of type @xmath47 , @xmath57 we calculate the lowest - lying radial meson mode by considering small fluctuations about the embedding . in the range of parameters for which our order @xmath58 approximation to the polchinski - strassler background is valid , we find that the meson mass satisfies @xmath59 , with @xmath60 the quark mass and @xmath61 , @xmath62 some constants .",
    "this behaviour coincides with expectations from field theory : the offset @xmath62 results from the presence of the adjoint hypermultiplet masses and corresponds to a mass gap for the mesons .    in this paper",
    "we are mainly concerned with the technical aspects of embedding a @xmath0-brane in the polchinski - strassler background , and leave physical applications for the future .",
    "still , let us mention the interesting possibility of d - term supersymmetry breaking in the dual field theory by switching on a non - commutative instanton on the @xmath0-brane , along the lines of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this may provide a gravity dual realization of metastable susy vacua @xcite , complementary to @xcite .",
    "the effect of commutative instantons on the @xmath0-brane in the ads / cft context was studied in @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ psbackground ]",
    ", we obtain the @xmath3 background to order @xmath23 in the flux perturbation , adapting the @xmath20 results of @xcite .",
    "moreover we discuss the structure of the metric in the deep interior of the space , which is helpful for understanding the symmetries and the infrared behaviour of the embedding .",
    "in section [ forms ] we present the necessary ramond - ramond forms for the dbi analysis , and in particular calculate the form @xmath63 .    in section [ analytics ]",
    "we perform the embedding by establishing the dirac - born - infeld and chern - simons actions , deriving the equations of motion for the embedding , and discussing the solutions .",
    "moreover we discuss the role of the gauge and @xmath49 fields . by expanding the embedding functions to second order in the adjoint masses ,",
    "we find analytic solutions for the embedding .",
    "we show that they are consistent with supersymmetry by applying holographic renormalization .",
    "in section [ numerics ] we present a numerical analysis of the embeddings . moreover , as an example for an associated meson mass , we calculate the meson mass obtained from small radial fluctuations about the embedding @xmath47 , @xmath42 .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] . a number of lengthy and involved calculations are relegated to a series of appendices .",
    "the metric of @xmath64 in the einstein frame reads ( see appendix [ app : nc ] for our notation and conventions ) @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the other fields of the background read simply @xmath68 where we put a ` hat ' on @xmath69 , @xmath70 to denote the unperturbed @xmath64 quantities .",
    "the unperturbed dilaton @xmath71 is related to the string coupling constant @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath74-form field strength @xmath75 follows from the @xmath76-form potential @xmath77 that reads @xmath78 by taking the exterior derivative and then imposing the condition of self - duality .    on the field theory side ,",
    "@xmath79 supersymmetry is broken by adding mass terms for the three adjoint chiral multiplets to the superpotential @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "for generic masses , the theory has @xmath82 supersymmetry , while for @xmath21 , @xmath83 it has @xmath55 supersymmetry .",
    "as shown in @xcite , on the gravity side the perturbation by the relevant mass operators corresponds to a non - trivial @xmath2 flux , which is constructed from an imaginary anti - self dual tensor @xmath84 , i.e.  @xmath84 fulfills @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the six - dimensional hodge star in flat space .",
    "this condition ensures that @xmath84 forms a @xmath87 representation of the @xmath88 isometry group of @xmath89 , and hence transforms in the same way as the fermion mass matrix in the dual gauge theory .",
    "the tensor field @xmath2 with the necessary asymptotic behaviour to be dual to the mass perturbation is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a numerical constant ( @xmath92 in a proper normalization scheme @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath4-form potential @xmath93 is constructed from the components of @xmath84 as follows , @xmath94    to present the explicit form of @xmath84 it is advantageous to work in a basis of three complex coordinates @xmath95 for the transverse space directions @xmath27 which is defined by @xmath96 the @xmath95 coordinates are dual to the three complex scalars @xmath97 of the chiral multiplets @xmath98 .    in this basis ,",
    "a constant anti - selfdual antisymmetric @xmath1-tensor @xmath84 for a diagonal mass matrix with eigenvalues @xmath18 , @xmath19 is given by @xmath99 in components the tensor @xmath84 reads @xmath100 @xmath93 is proportional to the potential of @xmath2 , which up to quadratic order in the mass perturbation ( where only the constant @xmath101 enters the definition of @xmath2 ) reads , @xmath102 the above given complex expression decomposes into real and imaginary part as @xmath103 as shown in @xcite , the solution corresponding to the mass peturbation in the @xmath87 obeys @xmath104      the unperturbed background is given by the @xmath64 metric with the @xmath74-form field strength and constant axion dilaton as in .    a non - vanishing mass perturbation parameterized by @xmath2 starts at linear order in the masses @xmath18 .",
    "at linear order in @xmath18 away from the @xmath13-brane source the background is then given by the unperturbed result , @xmath2 itself and an induced @xmath105-form potential .",
    "this potential has to be included in an analysis of @xmath74-brane probes , and its rr part @xmath106 , was determined to be @xcite @xmath107    beyond the linear approximation , at quadratic order in @xmath18 the corrections also effect the metric , @xmath76-form potential @xmath77 , and the complex dilation axion @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , we will show that also an @xmath5-form potential is induced , to which the @xmath0-brane probe couples .",

    "@xmath115 and according to @xcite they satisfy @xmath116 it is essential to note that the metric has a curvature singularity at the origin , where the ricci scalar is given by @xmath117    for completeness we also state the expression for the dilaton @xmath118 here @xcite .",
    "it is determined by the equation of motion for the complex dilaton - axion @xmath70 defined as the combination in .",

    "this coupling has an interpretation as a polarization of the @xmath121-brane , with its worldvolume becoming higher dimensional . in the presence of potentials",

    "we first discuss the @xmath55 supersymmetric case , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the only non - vanishing independent components are given by @xmath128 inserting the non - vanishing imaginary parts into the equation for the embedding matrices @xmath27 , gives rise to two @xmath129 lie algebras in the @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 directions .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig : d3polsymm ] , the @xmath13-branes are polarized into all their transverse directions except of @xmath140 with the same radius @xmath141 , spanning a four - dimensional subspace . in the subplanes spanned by @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 (",
    "depicted in red ) and @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath132 ( depicted in orange ) , the coordinates are noncommutative , while in the subplane @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 ( depicted in green ) the two sets of coordinates commute .",

    "this configuration is symmetric under rotations of @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and hence should also lead to an embedding of a @xmath0-brane which is symmetric under these rotations , e.g.  which does only depend on the radial coordinate @xmath139 .",
    "the @xmath13-branes are also smeared out along these directions of the @xmath0-branes . since",
    "the @xmath13-branes are only polarized into the direction @xmath132 , this also means that the rotational invariance in the @xmath140 , @xmath132 plane is lost .",
    "this corresponds to the breaking of the @xmath38 symmetry .    for comparison",
    "let us also consider the @xmath20 case where all adjoint chiral masses are equal . here , the tensor components of @xmath84 in become @xmath143 the @xmath13-branes are also extended in the @xmath140-direction .",

    "@xmath145 in the @xmath55 case discussed above , the latter two have a radius bigger by a factor of @xmath146 .",

    "the situation is different for the two @xmath4-spheres having in common @xmath132 .",
    "their equations read @xmath149 they are of different sizes .",
    "the above equations induce the relation @xmath150 at @xmath151 one has @xmath152 , and the equation becomes @xmath153 at @xmath40 , one finds a rotational ellipsoid .    although topologically one still has a ball @xmath138 , the difference in the length of the principal axes breaks the rotational symmetries in the @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 plane . still , the configuration is symmetric under rotations in the @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath133 , @xmath134 planes , but it is no longer symmetric under rotating these planes into each other .",
    "this breaking of the underlying @xmath31 symmetry into @xmath154 prevents one from finding an embedding of a @xmath0-brane depending on the radial coordinate @xmath139 in this plane only .",
    "we proceed by describing the @xmath0-brane embedding and its symmetries . for comparison ,",
    "we first recall the case of the undeformed @xmath64 background @xcite , in which the embedding of a @xmath0-brane probe along @xmath155 with zero distance from the background generating @xmath13-branes breaks the original @xmath156 symmetry to @xmath157 , such that there is a remaining @xmath3 supersymmetry .- branes and the @xmath0-brane , also the @xmath38 symmetry is broken . ]",
    "this scenario is displayed in figure [ kksym ] .",
    "let us now consider the symmetries of the polchinski - strassler background with non - trivial @xmath2 flux at order @xmath58 .",
    "for simplicity we consider the case in which @xmath21 and @xmath83 and , such that the background preserves @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "as the discussion of section [ polarization ] shows ( see equations ( [ tn2 ] ) and ( [ 2spheres ] ) in particular ) , the background preserves a global @xmath6 symmetry in this case .",
    "the background preserves two 2-spheres which have one direction in common . as ( [ invariant ] ) shows",
    ", @xmath139 is an invariant under this @xmath158 .",
    "it is thus convenient to embed the @xmath0-brane probe into the directions @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 .",
    "this embedding preserves the symmetries of the background .",
    "note that the background does not have any further @xmath38 , which corresponds to the fact that superconformal symmetry is broken by the adjoint hyper mass terms .",
    "this embedding is displayed in figure [ pssym ] .",
    "we denote the real directions @xmath163 along the @xmath0-brane with indices @xmath164 , and the directions @xmath165 perpendicular to it with @xmath166 . in the complex",
    "coordinates , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "these symmetries are consistent with the symmetries of the @xmath3 field theory in which the adjoint hypermultiplet is massive .",
    "the corresponding classical @xmath3 lagrangian is @xmath169 { ~,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superpotential @xmath170 is @xmath171 the superfields @xmath172 and @xmath173 make up the @xmath55 fundamental hypermultiplet .",
    "following the assignment of charges of @xcite , we observe that this lagrangian has an @xmath174 symmetry , where the first @xmath175 rotates the two complex scalars in each hypermultiplet into each other .",
    "the mass terms explicitly break the @xmath38 symmetry of the @xmath176 superconformal group .",
    "this applies already to the adjoint mass term before turning on the fundamental fields , since the @xmath38 charges of @xmath177 , @xmath178 are zero , whereas a superconformal superpotential requires a @xmath38 charge of @xmath4 .",
    "thus the field theory symmetries agree with the supergravity symmetries .",
    "we have calculated the contributions to the background fields necessary for the @xmath0-brane probe embedding at order @xmath23 . in particular the induced @xmath63 form , which has not been considered in the literature ,",
    "is needed when adding @xmath0-branes .",
    "its computation is given below in section [ c8subsection ] .",
    "to summarize , the background rr and nsns forms read @xmath179 where @xmath180 denotes the unperturbed @xmath76-form potential given by the first term on the r.h.s .  in the equation for @xmath77 above .",
    "the two types of corrections in @xmath77 are of order @xmath23 .",
    "one of them has components along the spacetime directions spanned by @xmath25 , the other comes from the redefinition of the @xmath76-form and has no components in these directions .",
    "it turns out that only @xmath180 is relevant for a @xmath0-brane embedding up to order @xmath23 .",
    "we also note that we can ignore the backreaction on @xmath2 itself , since it would be of order @xmath181 .",
    "we show that the backreaction of @xmath2 on the background at order @xmath58 induces a non - vanishing @xmath5-form potential @xmath63 with field strength @xmath182 .",
    "this potential couples to the @xmath0-brane charge and hence has to be considered in an embedding of @xmath0-branes in the polchinski - strassler background .",
    "the physical field strengths are defined in .",
    "they are not all independent but are related to their corresponding hodge duals according to . from these equations",
    "one finds , after transforming to einstein frame with , that the @xmath5-form potential @xmath63 obeys the equation @xmath183 it therefore depends on the non - constant corrections to @xmath69 which start at order @xmath58 as well as on non - vanishing potentials @xmath49 and @xmath106 .",
    "taking the exterior derivative , thereby using that the @xmath105-form @xmath106 satisfies @xmath184 one finds @xmath185 this expression should vanish identically due to the nilpotency of the exterior derivative . using the equation of motion for the axion found as the real part of which up to quadratic order in the mass perturbation",

    "the reversed sign in the relation @xmath187 of is thereby crucial for the consistency .    inserting the expression for @xmath106 into and then using one finds that @xmath63 decomposes as @xmath188 where @xmath189 is a @xmath76-form which has to be determined from the equation for the remaining components transverse to the worldvolume of the @xmath13-branes @xmath190 the first term in is found from the equation of motion for the complex dilaton - axion @xmath70 which reads after using and neglecting terms beyond quadratic order in the masses @xmath191 to find the r.h.s .",
    "we have also used the identity @xmath192 together with and with . considering the bianchi identity @xmath193 this equation",
    "can be integrated easily and becomes @xmath194 inserting this result , the equation for @xmath189 then assumes the form @xmath195 after some elementary manipulations the bianchi identity @xmath196 becomes @xmath197 therefore @xmath198 must follow from a @xmath76-form potential .",
    "the equation of motion can be transformed to @xmath199 the bianchi identity thereby ensures that a potential for the first term and hence a @xmath76-form @xmath189 must exist . as shown in appendix [ app : c8 ] , the first term in can be rewritten as @xmath200 using also the reexpression of @xmath93 in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath123 , the @xmath76-form potential therefore reads @xmath201 and together with it determines @xmath63 . using the expression for @xmath180 ,",
