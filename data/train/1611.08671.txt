    "<S> this gives rise to a total topological charge of @xmath66 in the single particle level , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ arc](d ) . </S>",

    "<S> a natural question is then , what is the fate of such weyl semimetals ? </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could consider tuning the chemical potential away from weyl points so that the fermi surface becomes finite . </S>",
    "<S> such finite fermi surface indicates that the low lying excitations in the interacting system are actually located at momenta away from the weyl points of the non - interacting system . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus desired to explore whether the weyl point , which is now embedded inside the fermi sea , is relevant to the emergent superfluidity when the attractive interaction is turned on .    using @xmath67 to denote these two hyperfine spin states , </S>",

    "<S> our hamiltonian is different from the ones previously studied in the literature , where the degree of freedom that participates in the interaction is the same as that provides the band crossing@xcite . here , we consider the attractive interaction between two weyl semimetals or two normal metals with small fermi surfaces . </S>",

    "<S> we first consider @xmath81 , i.e. , a finite fermi surface surrounding each weyl point in the bz . turning on one of the interactions , say @xmath82 or @xmath83 , it turns out that there exists one point on each fermi surface remaining gapless , whereas the superfluid gap opens anywhere else , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the superscript @xmath102 is the valley index , representing the two fermi surfaces surrounding the two weyl points in non - interacting systems . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath103 describes a bogoliubov quasiparticle spectrum , which is linear along the @xmath104 direction and quadratic along the @xmath105 and @xmath106 directions , since the off - diagonal term @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> it thus describes a monopole of charge-@xmath66 in the momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> we thus see that the topological charge when introducing attraction interaction shows up in bogoliubov quasiparticle spectrum .    turning on the other interaction , the monopole of charge-@xmath66 splits to two charge-@xmath108 ones , i.e. , two weyl points , in the @xmath109-@xmath110 plane </S>",
    "<S> , the positions of which are denoted as @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> [ arc](e , f ) . </S>",
    "<S> near these two weyl points , the dispersion becomes linear along all three directions . </S>",
    "<S> since the non - interacting system has a four - fold rotation symmetry about the @xmath113 axis , and such a splitting reduces the symmetry to a two - fold one , the choice of the direction for the splitting is a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking , along either @xmath114 or @xmath110 direction . by changing the ratio @xmath115 , </S>",
    "<S> these two weyl points move in bz before meeting their counterparts with opposite chiralities emerged from the other valley . for non - interacting systems </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that tuning the parameters leads to the movement of weyl points without opening the gap . in our system , </S>",
    "<S> tuning interaction also offers such opportunity to control the positions of weyl points in the bogoliubov quasiparticle spectrum in bz .    </S>",
    "<S> there is an alternative way to understand why the 3d superfluid remains nodal with turning on a small @xmath82 . as shown in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hbcs ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ arc](d - f ) , in 3d bz each 2d plane with fixed @xmath113 defines an 2d @xmath116 superfluid , similar to the one emerged from a 2d shaken lattice  @xcite . whereas tuning @xmath113 effectively changes the chemical potential of such 2d superfluid , its chern number can be computed straightforwardly . when @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the @xmath19 component of @xmath111 ( and @xmath119 ) , this 2d chiral superfluid is topologically nontrivial with a chern number of 2 , as the chiral component @xmath120 is dominant for small @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath121 , @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> the topological transition of the 2d superfluid just corresponds to the nodal points . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the nodal points can not be suddenly gapped , and the 3d superfluid remains nodal when @xmath82 is small enough .    </S>",
    "<S> the pairing here is an inter - valley bcs pairing between @xmath123 and @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> there have been studies of the competition between the inter- and intra - valley parings near weyl points@xcite . here , it is the hyperfine spin states that incorporate the interaction effect . </S>",
    "<S> we find out that , at least in the mean field level , the inter - valley pairing wins . </S>",
    "<S> this can be qualitatively understood from the phase space argument . in the inter - valley pairing </S>",
    "<S> , a paired state @xmath125 can be scattered to both @xmath126 and @xmath127 . for the intra - valley </S>",
    "<S> paring , a paired state @xmath128 could only be scattered to @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the inter - valley paring gains more energy than the intra - valley paring ( supplementary materials ) . </S>",
    "<S> another mechanism favoring the inter - valley pairing is that @xmath130 is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> since the shaking is spin - independent , @xmath131 is thus valid . </S>",
    "<S> however , near the same weyl point , @xmath132 is not exactly the same as @xmath133 , when @xmath92 is large enough and the linear approximation for the single particle energy is no longer accurate . </S>",
    "<S> this energy mismatch disfavours the intra - valley pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider half filling @xmath134 . in such weyl semimetal , due to the vanishing fermi surfaces , a weak attractive interaction is no longer relevant@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations indeed show that the pairing remains vanishing before either or both interactions reach a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the critical interaction strength by itself is not universal , in the sense that it depends on the details of the single - particle spectrum at both low and high energies . for a purely linear dispersion , </S>",
    "<S> the critical value is written as @xmath135 for @xmath89 , where @xmath136 is the high energy cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> in realistic systems , the high energy part of the spectrum is no longer linear , and is also important to the critical interaction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is no simple expression of @xmath137 . nevertheless , if @xmath138 , the results become similar to those with a finite fermi surface . </S>",

    "<S> [ arc](a ) , it is more interesting to explore the interacting case when the nodal superfluids have emerged . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the bdg equation for half filling self - consistently with ( 100 ) surface such that @xmath110 and @xmath113 are still good quantum numbers , and the zero energy surface state is shown in fig .  </S>",
