    "we found significant differences between our results , and those obtained by other authors in previous exact calculations of the models of maximally rotating strange star models .",
    "as noted in the early papers on the properties of strange stars , models of static massive ( @xmath230 ) strange stars are characterized by global stellar parameters ( mass , radius , moment of inertia , surface redshift ) which are rather similar to those of ordinary neutron stars ( haensel et al .",
    "1986 , alcock et al .",
    "in contrast to the static case , rapidly rotating strange stars exhibit qualitative differences with respect to rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "strange stars rotating close to the break up ( keplerian ) frequency have kinetic to gravitational energy ratio @xmath231 , which is nearly twice larger than corresponding values for neutron stars .",

    "strange matter inside massive ( @xmath236 ) strange stars is very stiff in the outer ( surface ) layers and soft in the central core .",
    "large value of @xmath0 may signal a relative softness ( susceptibility ) of rapidly rotating strange stars to triaxial instabilities .    for simple strange matter eos , used in the present paper ,",
    "several exact scaling relations hold for extremal ( maximum frequency , maximum mass ) configurations of rotating strange stars",
    ". maximum rotation frequency as well as maximum mass of rotating configurations exhibit an exact scaling with respect to the value of the bag constant . empirical formula for @xmath168 for neutron stars , which relates this quantity to the mass and radius of static configuration with maximum allowable mass , holds with a high precision also for strange stars .",
    "minimum period of rotating strange stars , stable with respect to axisymmetric perturbations , obtained for an acceptable range of the bag constant , is @xmath237ms , and therefore similar to that characteristic of realistic models of neutron stars .",

    "uniform rotation can increase the massimum allowable mass of strange stars by more than @xmath238 , to be compared with only 20% increase for realistic models of neutron stars .",
    "it should be stressed , that our numerical results for rapidly rotating strange stars , summarized in eqs.(24,25 ) , and eqs.(27,28,29 ) , have been obtained for a schematic eos , eq.(3 ) .",
    "this particular eos has been selected for the sake of simplicity and , last but not the least , for numerical convenience .",
    "the most general - generic - feature of an eos of strange matter is the existence of a self - bound state at zero pressure , with @xmath239  mev .",
    "however , the actual eos of strange matter - should it exist - is expected to be different from that given by eq.(3 ) .",
    "therefore , results of the present paper neither represent the full range of possibilities for `` theoretical '' strange stars , nor they are expected to correspond to precise actual values of parameters of rapidly rotating strange stars - should they exist in nature .",
    "the equation of state of strange matter , used in the present paper , has been derived neglecting strange quark mass and representing all effects of qcd interactions by one parameter - the bag constant @xmath9 . however , this simplest ( minimal ) model exhibits generic properties of the eos of a self - bound quark matter .",
    "generally , inclusion of perturbative corrections , expressed in terms of the qcd coupling constant @xmath240 , and of the strange quark mass @xmath241 , imply shifting down and simultaneous narrowing of the window of the values of @xmath9 compatible with strange matter hypothesis ( farhi & jaffe 1984 ) .",
    "typical values of @xmath242 are @xmath243 ; the effect of @xmath244 on the eos is then much smaller than that of @xmath242 .",
    "scaling relations between extremal strange star configurations , corresponding to different values of @xmath9 ( at fixed values of @xmath240 , @xmath242 ) are than no longer exact . in the case of static strange star models , they are still very precise ( after the prefactors in these relations have been recalculated to include the effect of @xmath240 and @xmath242 ) and therefore useful ( haensel et al .",
    "1986 ) ; similar situation is expected to take place in the case of rotating strange star models . in the static case , the effect of non - zero @xmath242 and @xmath240 consisted in making the maximum mass configurations less massive but more compact , and we expect similar effect for the extremal configurations of rotating strange stars .    in this paper",
    "we restricted ourselves to the case of strange stars with superdense quark surface , built exclusively of strange quark matter ( bare strange stars ) . in principle",
    ", one should consider also models of strange stars , covered by an envelope ( crust ) consisting of nuclei immersed in electron gas ( alcock et al .",
    "the nuclei , forming a crystal lattice of the crust , are separated from strange matter by a repulsive coulomb barrier .",
    "both coulomb barrier , and characteristic spatial gap between nuclei and strange matter , result from an electric dipole layer on the quark surface , due to the nonuniform density distribution of electrons near the quark surface .",
    "the presence of electrons in strange matter , necessary for equilibrium of quark core core with crust , results from nonzero strange quark mass .",
    "the maximum mass of the crust on a @xmath245 strange star was originally estimated as @xmath246 ( alcock et al .",
    "further studies of the crust  strange matter coexistence conditions led to an even lower value of the maximum mass of the crust on a @xmath236 strange star , of the order of @xmath247 ( huang & lu 1997 ) . in the case of the static strange star models ,",
    "the effect of the presence of the crust on the maximum allowable mass configuration is very small .",
    "rapid rotation will increase the maximum mass of a strange star crust ( glendenning & weber 1992 ) , but still its effect on the maximally rotating and maximum mass configurations may be expected to be small : both @xmath168 and @xmath174 will be slightly reduced , as compared with the case of bare strange stars . it should be stressed , that the only existing calculation of rapid rotation of strange stars with crust ( glendenning & weber 1992 ) was performed within a version of slow rotation approximation .",
    "the multi - domain method with adaptable grid , used in the present paper , is also suitable for an exact treatment of rapid rotation of strange stars with crust , in which matter density exhibits a huge discontinuity at the quark matter  crust interface , with outward density drop by more than three orders of magnitude .",
