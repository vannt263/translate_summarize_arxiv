    "the energy spectrum of single muons and multiple muons in bundles was also parameterised , taking into account the dependence of the muon energy on the shower multiplicity and on the distance of the muon from the shower axis .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows : @xmath249 the distribution of the muon multiplicities in a bundle does depend on the vertical depth @xmath4 and zenith angle @xmath5 ; @xmath250 for a fixed zenith angle @xmath5 , bundles with high multiplicity are suppressed when @xmath4 increases ; @xmath251 the average distance of each muon in a bundle does depend on the bundle multiplicity @xmath8 , and on @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; @xmath252at a given depth , the average distance of each muon in a bundle decreases slightly when the multiplicity @xmath8 increases .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood because bundles with high multiplicities are produced on average from primary parents of higher energies ; @xmath253the average energy of a muon in a bundle depends on the depth @xmath4 , on the zenith angle @xmath5 , on the bundle multiplicity @xmath8 and on the distance r of the muon from the shower axis .",
