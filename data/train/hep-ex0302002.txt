    "an additional nylon screen between the scintillator vessel and pmts ( against radon penetration ) and a muon veto system were installed .",
    "the scintillation light is collected with 100 phototubes ( pmt ) fixed to a 7 m diameter support structure inside the water tank .",
    "the pmts are fitted with light concentrators which provide a total of 21% optical coverage .",
    "the number of photoelectrons measured experimentally is 3.54 per pmt for 1 mev electrons at the detector s center .    for each event the charge and timing of hit pmts are recorded .",
    "each channel is supported by an auxiliary channel , the so - called second group of electronics , used to record all events coming within a time window of 8.2 ms after the trigger , which allows tagging of fast time - correlated events with a decrease of the overall dead time of the detector . for longer delays ,",
    "the computer clock is used providing the accuracy of @xmath740.1 s. event parameters measured in the ctf include the total charge collected by the pmts during 0500 ns , used to determine an event s energy ; the charge in the `` tail '' of the pulse ( 48548 ns ) which is used for pulse shape discrimination ; pmt timing , used to reconstruct the event s position ; and the time elapsed between sequential events , used to tag time - correlated events .",

    "the energy is supposed to be linear with respect to the total collected charge .",
    "the coefficient linking the event energy and the total collected charge is called light yield ( or photoelectron yield ) .",

    "for the calculations of the ionitazion quenching effect for pxe scintillator we used the kb program from the cpc library @xcite .",
    "the `` ionization quenching '' effect leads to a shift in the position of the full energy peak for gammas on the energy scale calibrated using electrons .",
    "in fact , the position of the 1461 kev @xmath90k gamma in the ctf - ii data corresponds to 1360 kev of energy deposited for an electron .",
    "the detector energy and spatial resolution were studied with radioactive sources placed at different positions inside the active volume of the ctf .",
    "a typical spatial 1@xmath91 resolution is 10  cm at 1 mev .",
    "the studies showed also that the total charge response of the ctf detector can be approximated by a gaussian .",
    "for energies @xmath92@xmath931 mev ( which are of interest here ) , the relative resolution can be expressed as @xmath94 ( @xmath92 is in mev ) @xcite for events uniformly distributed over the detector s volume .",

    "further details on the energy and spatial resolutions of the detector and ionization quenching for electrons , @xmath40 quanta and @xmath96 particles can be found in @xcite .",
    "the upgrade of the ctf was equipped with a carefully designed muon veto system .",
    "it consists of 2 rings of 8 pmts each , installed at the bottom of the tank .",
    "the radii of the rings are 2.4 and 4.8 m. muon veto pmts are looking upward and have no light concentrators .",
    "the muon veto system was optimized in order to have a negligible probability of registering the scintillation events in the so - called `` neutrino energy window '' ( 250800 kev ) .",
    "the behaviour of the muon veto at the higher energies has been specially studied for the present work .",
    "experimental measurements with a radioactive source ( chain of @xmath97ra ) @xcite gave , for the probability @xmath98 of identification of an event with energy @xmath92 in the ls by the muon veto , the value of ( 1@xmath990.2)% in the 1.82.0 mev region ( see fig . 3 later ) .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath98 was also calculated by a ray - tracing monte carlo method accounting for specific features of the light propagation in the ctf which are detailed in @xcite .",

    "have to satisfy the following criteria : ( 1 ) the event should occur in the active volume of the detector and must not be accompanied by the muon veto tag ; ( 2 ) it should be single ( not followed by a time - correlated event ) ; ( 3 ) its pulse shape must correspond to that of events caused by @xmath40 or @xmath100 particles .",
    "the selection and treatment of data ( spatial cuts , analysis of an event s pulse shape to distinguish between electrons and @xmath96 particles , suppression of external background by the muon veto system , etc . ) is similar to that in ref .",
