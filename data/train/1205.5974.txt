    "absorbing - state phase transitions have attracted much interest in recent decades , as they appear in a wide variety of problems , such as population dynamics , heterogeneous catalysis , interface growth , and epidemic spreading @xcite .",
    "interest in such transitions has been further stimulated by recent experimental realizations @xcite .",
    "the absorbing - state universality class associated with directed percolation ( dp ) has proven to be particularly robust .",
    "dp - like behavior appears to be generic for absorbing - state transitions in models with short - range interactions and lacking a conserved density or symmetry beyond translational invariance @xcite .",
    "by contrast , models possessing two absorbing states linked by particle - hole symmetry belong to the voter model universality class @xcite .    the contact process ( cp ) @xcite is probably the best understood model exhibiting an absorbing - state phase transition ; it has been known for many years to belong to the dp class .",
    "the cp can be interpreted as a stochastic birth - and - death process with a spatial structure . as a control parameter ( the reproduction rate @xmath1 )",
    "is varied , the system undergoes a phase transition between extinction and survival . in this context",
    "it is natural to seek a manner to include symbiotic interactions in the cp . in the present work",
    ", this is done by allowing two cps ( designated as species a and b ) to inhabit the same lattice .",
    "the two species interact via a reduced death rate , @xmath3 , at sites occupied by individuals of both species .",
    "( aside from this interaction , the two populations evolve independently . )",
    "we find , using mean - field theory and monte carlo simulation , that the symbiotic interaction favors survival of a mixed population , in that the critical reproduction rate @xmath5 decreases as we reduce @xmath3 .",
    "note that for @xmath6 , _ only _ mixed populations survive ; in isolation , either species must go extinct .",
    "in addition to its interest as a simple model of symbiosis , the critical behavior of the two - species cp is intriguing in the context of nonequilibrium universality classes .",
    "by analogy with the ( equilibrium ) @xmath7-vector model , in which the critical exponents depend on the number of spin components @xmath7 , one might imagine that the presence of two species would modify the critical behavior .",
    "using extensive simulations , we find that the critical behavior is consistent with that of directed percolation ( dp ) , although with surprisingly strong corrections to scaling .",
    "an argument based on field theory supports the conclusion of dp scaling .",
    "we note that our result agrees with that of janssen , who studied general multi - species dp processes @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions apply to a related model , a cp with creation at second - neighbor sites and enhanced survival at first neighbors , in the form of an annihilation rate that decreases with the number of occupied first neighbors .",
    "( in this case the two species inhabit distinct sublattices . )",
    "the balance of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the models and analyze them using mean - field theory . in sec .",
    "iii we present our simulation results , and in sec .",
    "iv we discuss a field - theoretic approach .",
    "v is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "to begin we review the definition of the basic contact process . following the usual nomenclature",
    ", we refer to an active site as being occupied by a  particle \" and an inactive one as  vacant \" .",
    "the cp @xcite is a stochastic interacting particle system defined on a lattice , with each site @xmath8 either occupied by a particle [ @xmath9 , or vacant [ @xmath10 .",
    "transitions from @xmath11 to @xmath12 occur at a rate of unity , independent of the neighboring sites .",
    "the reverse transition , a vacant site becoming occupied , is only possible if at least one of its nearest neighbors ( nns ) is occupied : the transition from @xmath12 to @xmath11 occurs at rate @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the fraction of nns of site @xmath8 that are occupied .",
    "thus the state @xmath12 for all @xmath8 is absorbing . at a certain critical value @xmath5 the system undergoes a phase transition between the active and the absorbing state @xcite .",
    "the cp has been studied intensively via series expansion and monte carlo simulation , and its critical properties are known to high precision @xcite .",
    "we now define a two - species symbiotic contact process ( cp2s ) .",
    "let the indicator variables for occupation of site @xmath8 by species a and b be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the allowed states for a site , @xmath17 , are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the transitions @xmath22 and @xmath23 occur at rate @xmath24 with @xmath25 the fraction of nns bearing a particle of species a. similarly , the rate for the transitions @xmath26 and @xmath27 is @xmath28 with @xmath29 the fraction of nns bearing a particle of species b. the transitions @xmath30 and @xmath31 occur at a rate of unity , whereas @xmath32 and @xmath33 at rate @xmath3 .",
    "this set of transition rates describes a pair of contact processes inhabiting the same lattice . for @xmath34",
    "the two processes evolve independently , but for @xmath0 they interact symbiotically , since the annihilation rates are reduced at sites with both species present .",
    "we note that the rates are symmetric under exchange of species labels a and b.    we also study a cp with creation at second - neighbor sites . in ref .",
    "@xcite a modified cp was defined so :    \\i ) in addition to creation at nns , at rate @xmath35 , we allow creation at _ second neighbors _ , at rate @xmath36 . for bi - partite lattices such as the ring or the square lattice , @xmath35 is the rate of creation in the opposite sublattice , while @xmath36 is the rate in the same sublattice as the replicating particle .",
    "\\ii ) the annihilation rate at a given site is @xmath37 , with @xmath7 denoting the number of occupied nns .    for @xmath38 , the presence of particle in one sublattice tends to suppress their survival in the other , leading to the possibility of sublattice ordering , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "suppose now that @xmath39 , and let @xmath40 .",
    "then the populations in the two sublattices constitute distinct species , since creation is always in the same sublattice . for @xmath41 ,",
    "moreover , the two species interact in a symbiotic manner , analogous to that in the two - species cp defined above .",
    "( for @xmath42 the two sublattices evolve independently . )",
    "we call this process the symbiotic sublattice contact process ( cpsls ) .",
    "both the cp2s and cpsls possess four phases : the fully active phase ( nonzero populations of both species ) , a symmetric pair of partly active phases ( only one species present ) , and the inactive phase ( all sites inactive ) .",
    "the latter is absorbing while the partly active phases represent absorbing subspaces of the dynamics .",
    "( that is , a species can not reappear once it goes extinct . ) let @xmath43 denote the critical creation rate of the basic cp . in the cp2s with @xmath34 ( or the cpsls with @xmath42 ) , the critical creation rate must be @xmath43 .",
    "the same applies for the transitions from the partly active phases to the absorbing one , regardless of the value of @xmath3 or @xmath44 .",
    "intuitively , in the presence of symbiotic interactions , one expects the transition from the fully active to the absorbing phase to occur at some @xmath45 , since the annihilation rate is reduced .",
    "since this expectation is borne out numerically , the partly active phases are of little interest , as they are not viable in the vicinity of the fully active - absorbing phase transition . understanding the latter transition is the principal objective of this study .    as a first step in characterizing the phase diagrams of the models ,",
    "we develop mean - field approaches .",
    "the derivation of a dynamic mean - field theory ( mft ) for an interacting particle system begins with the master equation for the set of one - site probabilities ( or , more generally , the @xmath7-site joint probability distribution ) @xcite . in this equation ,",
    "the @xmath7-site probability distribution is inevitably coupled to the distribution for @xmath46 or more sites .",
    "an @xmath7-site mft is obtained by estimating the latter distribution(s ) in terms of that for @xmath7 sites .",
    "here we consider the simplest cases , @xmath47 and 2 .",
    "consider the cp2s in the one - site approximation . denoting the probabilities for a given site to be vacant , occupied by species a only , by species b only , and doubly occupied by @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , respectively , assuming spatial homogeneity , and factorizing two - site joint probabilities ( @xmath52 = p[(\\sigma_i,\\eta_i)]p[(\\sigma_j,\\eta_j)]$ ] ) one readily obtains the equations    @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "the one - site mean - field theory ( mft ) for the cpsl was developed in ref .",

    "the equation is    @xmath82    and similarly for @xmath83 , on a lattice of coordination number @xmath84 .",
    "( here @xmath85 denotes the fraction of occupied sites in sublattice @xmath86 . ) as we seek a symmetric solution , we set @xmath87 .",

    "( note that @xmath44 must be greater than @xmath88 ; smaller values correspond to a _ negative _ annihilation rate , for @xmath89 near unity . )",
    "the two - site approximation is likely to provide a better description of the cpsls , since in this case the nearest - neighbor double occupancy probability is an independent variable , analogous to @xmath90 in the one - site mft of the cp2s .",
    "since such an analysis is unlikely to result in additional insights , we shall not pursue it here .    although mft predicts a discontinuous phase transition in the cp2s in any number of dimensions ,",
    "such a transition is not possible in one - dimensional systems with short - range interactions and free of boundary fields @xcite . in one dimension",
    "the active - absorbing transition should be continuous , as we have indeed verified in simulations .",
    "although our simulations show no evidence of a discontinuous transition in two dimensions ( @xmath91 ) , such a transition remains a possibility for @xmath92 , for small values of @xmath3 .",
    "a discontinuous transition might also arise under rapid particle diffusion , as this generally favors mean - field - like behavior .",
    "we performed extensive monte carlo simulations of the cp2s on rings and on the square lattice ( with periodic boundaries ) , and of the cpsls on rings .",
    "a general observation is that both models appear to be more strongly affected by finite - size corrections than is the basic cp .    in the simulation algorithm for the two - species cp , we maintain two lists , i.e. , of singly and doubly occupied sites .",
    "let @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote , respectively , the numbers of such sites , so that @xmath95 is the number of particles . the total rate of ( attempted ) transitions is @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the time increment associated with a given step in the simulation .",
    "at each such step , we choose among the events : ( 1 ) creation attempt by an isolated particle , with probability @xmath98 ; ( 2 ) creation attempt by a particle at a doubly occupied site , with probability @xmath99 ; ( 3 ) annihilation of an isolated particle , with probability @xmath100 ; and ( 4 ) annihilation of a particle at a doubly occupied site , with probability @xmath101 .",
    "once the event type is selected we choose a site @xmath8 from the appropriate list . in case of annihilation ,",
    "a particle is simply removed , while creation requires the choice of a neighbor , @xmath86 , of site @xmath8 , and can only proceed if @xmath86 is not already occupied by a particle of the species to be created . for creation by a particle at a doubly occupied site ,",
    "the species of the daughter particle is chosen to be a or b with equal probability , and similarly for annihilation at a doubly occupied site .    in simulations of the cpsls",
    "we maintain a list of occupied sites . at each step",
    "a site is selected from the list ; an attempt to create a new particle , at one of the second - neighbor sites , is chosen with probability @xmath102 ; the site is vacated with the complementary probability , @xmath103 .",
    "the time increment associated with each event is @xmath104 , with @xmath105 the number of particles just prior to the event .",

    "while the first case may be seen as a relatively small perturbation of the usual cp ( @xmath34 ) , the third represents a very strong departure from the original model .",
    "we perform three kinds of studies : quasi - stationary ( qs ) @xcite , initial decay ( starting from a maximally active configuration ) , and spreading , in which the initial condition is a doubly occupied site in an otherwise empty lattice .",

    "thus we are inclined to regard the asymptotic scaling of the symbiotic models as being that of dp , and to interpret the deviations as arising from finite - time and finite - size corrections .",
    "one might conjecture that under strong symbiosis , the critical system is rapidly attracted to the dp fixed point ( although not as rapidly as is the basic cp ) , whereas for weak symbiosis , it makes a long excursion into a regime in which dp - like scaling is not evident , before finally returning to the vicinity of the dp fixed point . the asymptotic scaling behavior is presumably associated with large , sparsely populated but highly correlated regions of doubly occupied sites , which , for reasons of symmetry , behave analogously to dp space - time clusters .",
    "the presence of isolated particles , which are relatively numerous and long - lived for weak symbiosis , could mask the asymptotic critical behavior , on short scales .",
    "we defer further analysis of these questions to future work .    extending the field theory of dp to the two - species case , we find that the irrelevance of four - field terms makes dp extremely robust , since the only possible three - field vertices are already present in the single - species theory .",
    "this means that the interaction between species can not alter the scaling behavior , as already noted by janssen in the case of multi - species dp processes @xcite .",
    "our simulation results , as noted , support this conclusion .",
    "a more detailed field - theoretic analysis , including the evolution of the lowest order irrelevant terms , might shed some light on the scaling anomalies observed in the simulations ."
