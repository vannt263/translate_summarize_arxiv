    "we find a new polynomial identity in characteristic  2 : @xmath15 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a dickson polynomial , defined by @xmath3 .",
    "using this identity , we prove that if @xmath4 is a field of characteristic  2 and @xmath5 is a nonzero element of @xmath4 , then for @xmath6 , the two polynomials @xmath7 and @xmath8 have the same splitting field over  @xmath4 , where @xmath9 is a mller  cohen  matthews polynomial of degree @xmath10 .",
    "we find explicit formulas relating the roots of the two polynomials , and we describe the galois action . as a result , when @xmath4 is finite , related factorizations of the two polynomials can be explained .",

    "exceptional_. )    a first draft of this article was written in the 20012004 timeframe , but was left and forgotten for over a decade .",
    "the project was resumed and completed in 2016 , with the following improvements .",
    "a hypothesis that the field @xmath4 must be perfect was removed , the new proof of exceptionality of @xmath11 was added , a simpler formula was found for the roots of @xmath11 , and a simpler description of dihedral subgroups of @xmath17 was obtained ( see proposition  6.1 ; an analogous proposition holds for @xmath18 odd as well . ) finally , references were updated to reflect advances in the understanding of exceptional polynomials that occurred in the intervening decade .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , the equality of the splitting fields of the two polynomials @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be derived from work of zieve @xcite and lenstra and zieve @xcite , at least in the case where @xmath5 is transcendental .",
    "many calculations in this paper could perhaps be done more expediently with their methods , which utilize group theory . however , the author was unaware of these methods at the time that she carried out her work , and as a result she used different techniques and was motivated by a different set of questions .",
    "we hope that this new perspective will complement the existing literature .",
    "the polynomial identity involving dickson polynomials in characteristic  2 is new .",
    "it seems to apply only to characteristic  2 .",
    "bob guralnick points out that the dickson polynomials are ramified at the prime  2 , thus it is not surprising to find formulas that are special to characteristic  2 .",
    "the results in our paper seem related to but different from results in abhyankar , cohen , and zieve @xcite .",
    "both our paper and theirs give a factorization of @xmath19 in terms of dickson polynomials and use it to deduce information about the galois groups of certain polynomials .",
    "however , the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 differ , and so do the galois groups that are involved .",
    "their identity generalizes to all characteristics , whereas ours applies only to characteristic  2 . a precise statement of the identity in @xcite",
    "is given in the remark preceding lemma  [ distinctlemma ] .",
    "it would be interesting to understand more fully how the two polynomial identities are related .",
    "finally , we mention that in one case , our work fits nicely with results of dummit @xcite on solvable quintics .",
    "namely , @xmath7 is a quintic when @xmath22 .",
    "dummit notes that a quintic ( over any field ) is solvable if and only if its galois group is contained in a group that is conjugate to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is generated by the permutations @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it turns out that an invariant @xmath27 for @xmath23 is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the roots of the quintic .",
    "let @xmath30 be coset representatives for @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath32 is a sextic . in the case of the polynomial @xmath33 in characteristic  2 ,",
    "the sextic is equal to @xmath34 . setting @xmath35",
    ", we see that this is equivalent ( has the same splitting field ) to @xmath36 .",
    "if we set @xmath37 and then take a fourth root , this reduces to our function @xmath38 .",
    "the substitution @xmath39 brings it to the form @xmath40 . the above expression for @xmath27 shows explicitly in this case how the roots of @xmath8 are related to the roots of the quintic .",
