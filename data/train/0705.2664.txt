    "supersymmetry  ( susy ) is still one of the most interesting possibilities to solve the hierarchy problem of the standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "a solution to this problem without excessive tuning requires that the massive parameters breaking susy softly are around the tev scale , which , for simplicity , is hereafter identified with the electroweak scale @xmath0 .",
    "irrespectively of the extensions needed to solve the hierarchy problem , the leptonic sector requires also an extension of the originally proposed sm structure of only three left - handed su(2 ) doublets , in order to accommodate neutrino masses .",
    "one way to proceed is to introduce sm singlets , or right - handed neutrinos  ( rhns ) , which can couple to the leptonic doublets with yukawa couplings of @xmath1 if their majorana masses are superheavy .",
    "this is the conventional and well - known seesaw mechanism , which enjoys immense popularity because of its elegance , but which is difficult to test experimentally .",
    "it is therefore very important to search for signals that can give information on the existence of the heavy particles realizing this mechanism .",
    "an obvious magnifying glass for them could be precisely their large yukawa couplings to the left - handed leptons , @xmath2 , and the large leptonic mixing angles in the mns matrix .",
    "indeed , these couplings can affect sizably the renormalization group  ( rg ) flow of the soft susy - breaking parameters for the sleptons   from the cutoff scale , at which the breaking of susy is mediated to the visible sector , @xmath3 , down to the seesaw scale @xmath4 .",
    "they lead to non - vanishing off - diagonal elements of the charged - slepton mass matrix at @xmath0 , or lepton - flavor violations  ( lfvs ) in the left - left sector of this matrix , @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of intrinsic flavor violations in the slepton mass parameters at @xmath3 , however , could completely obscure the effects of the rhn interactions through rg equations  ( rges ) .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves to considering models with flavor - blind susy breaking and mediation of this breaking .    if in addition , we embed these susy models in a grand unified theory  ( gut ) , the rhns interact with these large yukawa couplings also with the right - handed down quarks , which are the su(5 ) partners of the doublet leptons .",
    "hence , as pointed out by moroi  , these interactions can affect also the massive soft parameters of the down - squark sector , generating quark - flavor violations  ( qfvs ) in the scalar sector different from those induced by the quark yukawa couplings .",
    "in particular , in the superckm basis for quark superfields , the scalar qfvs due to the rhns are in the right - right sector of the down - squark mass matrix , @xmath6 , whereas those induced by the quark yukawa couplings in non - gut setups are in the left - left one  @xcite .",
    "( gut phases also appear when identifying the sm fields among the components of the su(5 ) multiplets . here",
    ", we neglect them altogether , postponing the discussion of their effect to a later occasion . )",
    "thus , it has been argued that , in susy su(5 ) models with rhns and flavor - blind soft massive parameters at @xmath3 , scalar lfvs and qfvs at @xmath0 are related to each other   in a simple way .    the minimal model , however , is not realistic : it predicts a too rapid proton decay and the wrong relation between the down - quark mass matrix and the charged - lepton s one .",
    "new physics beyond that of the minimal susy su(5 ) model is needed to cure these problems and it is easy to imagine that such additional degrees of freedom can modify even drastically the simple relations between lfvs and qfvs of ref .  , and of many successive works .",
    "we refer to these relations as moroi s predictions .    as is well known , one way to fix the incorrect fermion spectrum consists in the introduction of nonrenormalizable operators  ( nros ) , suppressed by @xmath7 .",
    "the effects on flavor violation of only one such nro of dimension - five ( sufficient for the purpose ) were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . they amount to introducing some arbitrariness in the choice of the flavor rotations of the sm fields when they are embedded in the su(5 ) multiplets .",
    "this is expressed by the appearance of two additional unitary matrices ( other than the rge - evolved ckm and mns ones ) , with arbitrary mixings among the first two generations , but with smaller ones among the third and the second / first generations . in the parameter space of mixings / phases opened up by the introduction of this nro",
    ", there is however still a region in which these unitary matrices of additional mixings reduce to the unit matrix . in this region ,",
    "the pattern of intergenerational sfermion mixings remains unchanged with respect to that obtained without nros , i.e. moroi s predictions for flavor transitions , then , can be kept as viable .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , did not discuss the problem of a too - large decay rate of the proton , induced by the exchange of colored higgs fields .",
    "one way to suppress it , compatible with their analysis , is to assume that there exist other nros , also suppressed by @xmath7 , that are baryon - number violating and that cancel ( up to experimentally tolerable remnants ) the colored - higgs - fields induced operators responsible for proton decay .",
    "these , indeed , are dimensionally suppressed by the inverse mass of the colored higgs fields , supposed to be larger than @xmath7 , but are also further suppressed by coefficients depending on small yukawa couplings and small ckm mixing angles .",
    "hence , the cancellation is expected to be possible , and the model of ref .",
    "@xcite can be made realistic with some tuning ( this is in addition to the intrinsic tuning required in this model for the doublet - triplet mass splitting ) .",
    "it remains , however , to be checked whether the parameter space of additional mixings / phases relevant for flavor transitions remains unchanged for all values of @xmath8 , once this cancellation is enforced .    as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , a technically different way to suppress proton decay becomes possible , if the number of nros employed to fix the fermion spectrum is enlarged .",
    "it was shown by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite that even only the addition of four nros of dimension five is sufficient to introduce enough su(5)-breaking effects to disentangle the yukawa couplings contributing to the coefficient of the effective operators responsible for proton decay from the couplings giving rise to fermion masses and mixings . at the expenses of some tuning , then , it is possible to make these effects large enough to reduce the rate for proton decay below experimental limits , even for colored higgs fields with mass of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the so - called gut scale .",
    "an enlargement of the number of nros allows even more freedom to achieve this suppression  @xcite .    motivated by these considerations ,",
    "we try to go one step further and study the relations between lfvs and qfvs in realistic `` minimal '' susy su(5 ) models  @xcite , with up to an infinite number of nros added to the minimal su(5 ) structure .",
    "these models share with the truly minimal one the fact that the higgs sector solely responsible for the breaking of the su(5 ) and the sm symmetries is given by the three higgs multiplets @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , with superpotential : @xmath14 we remind here that @xmath15 and @xmath16 contain the two weak higgs doublets @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the minimal supersymmetric sm , and two color triplets , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath13 has among its components @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are adjoint fields of su(3 ) , su(2 ) and u(1 ) , respectively .",
    "it contains also the vector - like pair @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) a triplet ( antitriplet ) of su(3 ) and a doublet of su(2 ) .",
    "the sm quark and lepton fields @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are collected in the two matter multiplets @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with one replica of them for each generation , interacting according to @xmath35 apart from the obvious extensions needed to accommodate neutrino masses , these models differ from the truly minimal one for the addition of nros .",
    "we treat them in as much generality as it is possible , for example by including practically all classes of those needed for the fermion spectrum , of all dimensions , since we find that the problem is actually technically manageable .",
    "this , however , does not exclude that some of these coefficients are accidentally vanishing . in this sense , if enough nros explicitly violating baryon number are introduced to suppressed proton decay in the way outlined above , also the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , with only one nro used to fix the fermion spectrum , becomes part of this class of models .",
    "we refrain from studying here the flavor predictions for this modification of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , but we restrict ourselves to models in which the suppression of the proton - decay rate is achieved with a procedure of the type outlined in ref .",
    "interestingly , this procedure is predictive . since it involves a specific flavor ansatz for the yukawa couplings mediating the proton decay rate , it fixes some of the additional mixings obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : it leaves moroi s predictions for flavor transitions between sfermions in the @xmath36 representation of su(5 ) unchanged , while induces modifications for those in the @xmath37 representations  @xcite . as for flavor transitions in the @xmath36 sector , we try to investigate what other type of ultraviolet physics may affect them . one obvious way to do that is to implement possible different types of the seesaw mechanism .",

    "[ seesaw ] .",
    "another way is to disentangle the cutoff scale from the reduced planck mass , @xmath38 , by taking it as an adjustable scale varying from @xmath38 and @xmath10 .",

    "in reality , the possibility of the singlet scalar is forbidden by the multiplication rule of su(2 ) : @xmath42 , where the indices @xmath43 and @xmath44 indicate an anti - symmetric and symmetric product , respectively . thus , there are only three types of seesaw mechanism , distinguished by the nature of the mediator , which can be an su(2 )    [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]      + & & & + lfv / qfv & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath46    [ tab : seesaw ]    indeed , the sm decomposition of the interactions in eq .",

    "it should be noticed here that the colored higgs field @xmath54 decouples at @xmath10 , which is at least two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath4 , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are integrated out .",
    "therefore , below @xmath10 , only the interactions without @xmath54 remain active .",
