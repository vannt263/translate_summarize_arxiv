    "the structure of a group which acts freely and cocompactly on a tree is well understood .",
    "any such a group is a finitely generated free group . by way of contrast",
    ", a group which acts in a similar manner on a product of trees can have remarkably subtle properties .",
    "for example , m. burger and s. mozes @xcite have proved rigidity and arithmeticity results analogous to the theorems of margulis for lattices in semisimple lie groups .",
    "this article will consider a discrete subgroup @xmath3 of @xmath4 where @xmath0 , @xmath1 are homogeneous trees of finite degree .",
    "in addition , we require that @xmath3 is torsion free and acts freely and transitively on the vertex set of @xmath5 .",
    "for simplicity , refer to such a group as a bm group .",
    "bm groups were used in @xcite to exhibit the first known examples of finitely presented , torsion free , simple groups .    a product of two trees may be regarded as the 1-skeleton of an affine building whose 2-cells are euclidean squares .",
    "a bm group @xmath3 acting freely and transitively on the vertex set of @xmath5 defines a 2-dimensional tiling system .",
    "associated to this tiling system there is a @xmath9-algebra @xmath10 , which is called a rank-2 cuntz - krieger algebra in @xcite .",
    "this algebra is isomorphic to a crossed product @xmath9-algebra @xmath11 arising from a boundary action of @xmath3 .",
    "it follows from the results of @xcite that @xmath11 is purely infinite , simple , unital and nuclear , and is therefore itself classified by its k - theory .",
    "this provides the motivation for us to examine the k - theory of these examples in some detail . in theorem [ maink ]",
    "we obtain an explicit expression for the k - theory of @xmath11 analogous to that of @xcite for algebras associated with @xmath12 buildings .",
    "in particular @xmath7 for this algebra . in proposition [ orderof1 ] , the class of the identity in @xmath13 is shown to be a torsion element .    in section [ exs",
    "] , these issues are examined for several explicit groups . in section [ bm2by2 ] a complete list is given of all bm groups acting on @xmath5 , where @xmath0 , @xmath1 are homogeneous trees of degree four .",
    "the abelianizations and k - groups are also computed .",
    "after this article was submitted , we became aware of the work of diego rattaggi @xcite , which undertakes a detailed analysis of bm groups , including extensive computations with explicit presentations .",
    "we are grateful to him for several helpful comments on this article .",
    "given a homogeneous tree  @xmath14 , there is a type map  @xmath15 defined on the vertices of  @xmath14 and taking values in @xmath16 . to see this , fix a vertex @xmath17 and define @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the usual graph distance between vertices of the tree .",
    "the type map partitions the set of vertices into two classes so that two vertices are in the same class if and only if the distance between them is even .",
    "thus the type map is independent of @xmath20 , up to addition of @xmath21 .",
    "since any automorphism of the tree preserves distances between vertices this observation proves    [ lem1 ] for each automorphism @xmath22 of @xmath14 there exists @xmath23 such that , for every vertex @xmath24 , @xmath25    suppose that  @xmath26 is the @xmath27 dimensional cell complex associated with a product @xmath28 of homogeneous trees .",

    "write @xmath30 for a generic vertex of @xmath26 .",
    "there is a type map  @xmath15 on the vertices of  @xmath26 where @xmath31 we say that an automorphism @xmath22 of  @xmath26 is * type - rotating * if there exists @xmath32 such that , for each vertex @xmath24 , @xmath33 the chambers of @xmath26 are geometric squares and each chamber has exactly one vertex of each type .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the group of type rotating automorphisms of @xmath26 .",
    "an automorphism @xmath22 of  @xmath26 is type - rotating if and only if it is a cartesian product of automorphisms of the two trees .",
    "if we have @xmath35 for some type rotating automorphisms @xmath36 of @xmath37 then it follows from lemma [ lem1 ] that @xmath22 is type rotating .",
    "conversely suppose that @xmath22 is type rotating .",
    "let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be neighbouring vertices in  @xmath26 .",
    "then  @xmath40 and @xmath41 are neighbouring vertices in  @xmath26 and the type - rotating assumption on  @xmath22 means that @xmath42 . since neighbouring vertices in  @xmath43 have distinct types we must have @xmath44 . by induction on  @xmath45 , we see that the first coordinate of  @xmath46 is independent of  @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , the second coordinate of  @xmath46 is independent of  @xmath48 . thus there",

    "explicit computations , using the formula ( [ kth ] ) and the magma computer algebra package , show that the order of @xmath357 $ ] is @xmath369 in each of the 28 groups @xmath439 where @xmath438 are two distinct primes @xmath462 .    the normal subgroup theorem ( * ? ? ?",

    "moreover @xmath466 is locally @xmath467 transitive .",

    "thus @xmath471 and so @xmath472 .",
    "explicit computations for the same range of values of @xmath473 as above shows that the second conjecture of remark [ conjectures ] is also verified in these cases .",
    "another experimental observation is the following . checking through a large number of values of the pairs of primes @xmath474 congruent to 1 mod 4",
    ", one sees that the abelianization of @xmath439 seems to depend only the greatest common divisor @xmath475 .",
    "in fact we conjecture that    @xmath476    the validity of this formula was checked for all values of the pair @xmath474 up to @xmath477 , and for several other values .",
    "a bm group acts on a product of homogeneous trees @xmath28 , where @xmath0 has degree @xmath479 and @xmath1 has degree @xmath480 .",
    "we now examine the simplest case @xmath478 .",
    "recall that a bm square is a set of four distinct tuples @xmath134 contained in @xmath133 , as in definition [ def bm group](i),(ii ) . in the presentation ( [ presentation ] ) ,",
    "a bm group has @xmath481 generators and a set of relations which we call a set of bm relations .",
    "possible sets of bm relations correspond to those unions of @xmath482 bm squares whose images under a projection chosen from definition [ def bm group](iii ) are disjoint .",
    "choose once and for all such a projection , say @xmath483 .",
    "consider the graph @xmath484 whose vertices are the bm squares and whose edges join bm squares having disjoint images under the chosen projection .",
    "possible sets of bm relations correspond to cliques ( complete subgraphs ) of size @xmath482 in the graph @xmath484 .",
    "the computer algebra package magma contains a dynamic programming algorithm due to @xcite for finding all cliques of a given size .",
    "for @xmath485 there are 541 cliques in @xmath484 of size @xmath128 .",
    "say that two of the corresponding presentations are equivalent if one may be obtained from the other by permuting the generators .",
    "there are precisely 52 equivalence classes of presentations . in the tables",
    "below we list 52 representative presentations , together with the structure of the groups @xmath486 and @xmath487 . for bm groups",
    "@xmath8 with semi - degrees @xmath485 , we have @xmath488 . thus @xmath489 .",
    "therefore the tables show that the conjectures of remark [ conjectures ] are verified for all such groups .    in the tables ,",
    "each of the 52 groups arising from these presentations is assigned a name @xmath490 . using an algorithm due to c. c. sims @xcite , which is implemented in the magma package",
    ", we have found the indices and lengths of all conjugacy classes of subgroups with index at most 8 in each of these 52 groups . from these data",
    "we have checked that the only possible isomorphisms between @xmath491 and @xmath492 occur if both @xmath493 and @xmath494 lie in one of the following sets :        the quotient complexes @xmath504 corresponding to the groups @xmath505 with @xmath493 in any of these sets are not homeomorphic , as can be seen by considering the fundamental groups of one point deletion subspaces of @xmath146 .",
    "one therefore obtains 52 pairwise non - homeomorphic complexes @xmath146 . of course",
    ", this does not imply that the groups @xmath8 are non - isomorphic .",
    "in fact , we have discovered tietze transformations showing that , if @xmath506 is contained in any one of the listed sets , except for @xmath507 or @xmath498 , then the corresponding groups are isomorphic .",
    "there are thus at most 43 non - isomorphic groups .",
    "we do not know whether the groups @xmath491 and @xmath492 are isomorphic in the two cases @xmath508 and @xmath509 .",
    "note that the shift system group @xmath487 depends only on @xmath8 and not on the presentation of @xmath8 .",
    "the following notation is used in the tables .",
    "the group @xmath3 is generated by @xmath148 where @xmath510 and @xmath511 .",
    "the fixed point free involution on each of these sets is given by @xmath512 .",
    "thus @xmath513 is denoted @xmath514 . moreover the relations are written in the form @xmath515 rather than the form @xmath516 used in definition [ def bm group ] .",
