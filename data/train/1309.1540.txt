    "@xcite and @xcite describe a new reduction , with improved treatment of small angular scale astrometric correlations noted by @xcite , of the _ hipparcos _ mission astrometric data that has lead to significantly increased accuracy .",
    "the result is a pleiades distance modulus in accord with the original _ hipparcos _ result . indeed , @xcite cite 3 clusters ( pleiades , blanco 1 , ngc 2516 ) whose main - sequence stars appear similarly subluminous when compared to those in other clusters .",
    "@xcite suggests that the discrepancy can be explained by a slightly sub - solar pleiades metallicity , [ m / h]@xmath7 , indicated by geneva photometry .",
    "however , @xcite have used the metallicity - sensitive stromgren @xmath8 index to select field stars having the same photometric metallicity as the pleiades to form an empirical pleiades zams with which to conduct main - sequence fitting ; @xcite deduce a pleiades distance modulus in close agreement with previous fitting , but at odds with the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes . @xcite",

    ", they find that the distance from main - sequence fitting is brought into agreement with the _ hipparcos _ results .",
    "the differences between the geneva- , 2-color plane- , and stromgen - based photometric pleiades metallicity estimates , as well as the simultaneous claims that metallicities of both @xmath10 and @xmath11 shift the evolutionary model main sequences into agreement with the hipparcos parallaxes , seem remarkable .",
    "the implication that a variety of independent modern high - resolution spectroscopic abundance analyses @xcite have consistently overestimated a near - solar pleiades metallicity also is remarkable .",
    "@xcite posits that the dichotomy between the _ hipparcos_-based h - r diagrams of the young pleiades , blanco 1 , and ngc 2516 clusters and older clusters like the hyades and praesepe is due to `` age - dependent luminosity effects '' that are neither empirically calibrated out of the theoretical isochrones nor included in the underlying evolutionary models .",
    "such a luminosity difference between the hyades / praesepe and pleiades main - sequences was inferred on the basis of stromgren photometry long ago @xcite , questioned by @xcite , but confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that this so - called `` hyades anomaly '' has simply been forgotten , rediscovered from _",
    "parallaxes , and relabeled as a pleiades parallax anomaly .",
    "while several origins of a real luminosity difference between the pleiades and hyades main - sequences exist @xcite , a suggestion as old as the hyades anomaly itself is inter - cluster he differences @xcite that yield inter - cluster luminosity differences .",
    "@xcite note that a pleiades he mass fraction of @xmath12 , compared to a solar value @xmath13 @xcite , could explain the 0.3 mag distance modulus discrepancy .",
    "observational evidence for such large @xmath14 values in young disk stars is muddy @xcite , and the determination of stellar he abundances is fraught with uncertainty and study - to - study differences .",
    "a relative comparison of pleiades he abundances with those in the hyades , for which the _ hipparcos_-based and main - sequence fitting - based distance moduli agree , remains elusive :  stellar he abundances are best - determined in b stars , which are absent in the hyades due to its age .",
    "chemical evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that map the coproduction of he , c , o , and fe in the galactic disk suggest he proxies could be used to examine the relative pleiades - hyades @xmath14 values in the context of relative cluster c , o , and fe abundances . while o abundances derived from high - excitation lines exhibit unsettling large trends with @xmath2 @xcite that complicate an assessment of relative cluster abundances , a reliable relative measure comes from the schuler et al .",
    "[ ] -based determinations for 3 dwarfs in each cluster .",
    "these data suggest @xmath15[o / h]@xmath16 ( pleiades@xmath17hyades ) .",
    "the @xcite chemical evolution models from @xcite yielding the largest @xmath14 difference for this negligible o difference suggest @xmath18 ( pleiades@xmath17hyades ) , significantly smaller than the @xmath19 prescribed by @xcite to resolve the pleiades distance modulus discrepancy .    high - excitation -based c abundances for cluster stars with @xmath20 k , above which there exists evidence that dynamic transport mechanisms can alter the photospheric abundance @xcite , yield [ c / h]@xmath21 and @xmath22 for the hyades and pleiades @xcite .",
    "interpreting these relative abundances with the @xcite models suggests @xmath14(pleiades ) is no larger than @xmath14(hyades ) at the @xmath23 confidence level . the difference ( pleiades @xmath17 hyades ) in mean cluster f - dwarf fe abundance is @xmath24[fe / h]@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the @xcite chemical evolution models suggest this corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "while these abundance comparisons are inconsistent with a he abundance difference able to resolve the pleiades distance modulus discrepancy , it may be that c , o , and fe are not reliable tracers of he .",
    "we suggest that n may serve as a more robust proxy for he , and that relative cluster n abundances should thus be examined .",
    "extant results suggest that [ n / fe]@xmath5 over a wide range of [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "such a primary nucleosynthetic production signature can not be produced by galactic chemical evolution models that solely assume explosive nucleosynthesis in massive stars @xcite ; rather , it is believed @xcite that n production occurs in low- and intermediate - mass stars ( lims ; @xmath27 ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that observations constrain the contribution of lims to n abundances in the solar neighbhorhood to @xmath28 , with massive stars contributing most of rest and type ia supernovae contributing negligibly .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate of @xcite , who ascribe only a quarter of solar n to that produced in massive stars .",
    "in contrast , o is the most abundant product of massive star explosive nucleosynthesis @xcite , over half of solar - metallicity fe in the disk comes from explosive production @xcite , and only half of c in the solar neighborhood is produced by lims @xcite .",
    "while recent chemical evolution models identify non - explosive massive star wind yields as a source of uncertainty in galactic he enrichment , the classic `` road map '' of @xcite identifies lims stars as the dominant nucleosynthetic he source ( see their table 19 ) , and there is no question that most of mass shed by evolved lims stars on their way to becoming white dwarfs is in the form of h and he .",
    "the chemical evolution model and observational constraints from @xcite suggest that the lims contribution to protosolar he ( over and above the primordial big bang contribution ) is @xmath29% .",
    "the nucleosynthetic results suggest that o and fe are unlikely to be as robust proxies of disk he as are c and n , and that it is possible that n is a more robust proxy of he than is c in the galactic disk .",
    "the essential point is the importance of comparing the pleiades - hyades n abundances in considering the role of he in the pleiades parallax anomaly .",
    "we present such a comparison using self - consistently derived n abundances in solar - type dwarfs in the pleiades and hyades .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath30 ) spectroscopy of pleiades and hyades nh features near 3328  was obtained over 3 observing runs in 1999 , 2001 , and 2002 using the keck i 10 m telescope and hires spectrograph .",
    "the spectra are those used in the be abundance studies of @xcite and @xcite , who provide details concerning the observations and data reduction .",
    "we utilize only a subset of these spectra here because the nh features become vanishingly weak and/or significantly blended in the hotter ( @xmath31 k ) stars and/or similarly less amenable to abundance analysis for the stars with larger rotational velocities ( @xmath32 km s@xmath33 ) .",
    "given the moderate trend in [ n / h ] abundance with @xmath2 we find for the ( more numerous ) cool hyades stars , we restrict our attention in the pleiades to stars with @xmath34 k , and also exclude stars for which binarity has been noted by others ( e.g. , 739 and 761 ) .    tables 1 and 2 list the hyades and pleiades stars analyzed here .",
    "hyades objects are listed with @xcite designations , while pleiades stars are listed by their @xcite identifications .",
    "examples of the spectra can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "stellar parameters taken from the be abundance studies of @xcite and @xcite were used to characterize lte model atmospheres interpolated from the grids of kurucz .",
    "the linelist of the 3328  region was compiled from atomic and molecular lines in the kurucz database , features in the vienna atomic line database @xcite , and molecular lines from lifbase @xcite .",
    "our adopted nh dissociation energy adopted is 3.45 ev , intermediate to the canonical value of 3.47 ev @xcite and the determination of 3.40@xmath35 ev implied by experimental measures of various relevant quantities by @xcite .",
    "oscillator strengths ( @xmath36-values ) were adjusted , typically by @xmath37 dex , to produce solar syntheses matching the kurucz solar flux atlas @xcite assuming solar cno ( logarithmic number ) abundances of 8.39 , 7.78 , and 8.69 @xcite ; all 3 abundances are prescribed because molecular equilibrium is included in the syntheses .",
    "lte synthetic spectra of varying n abundance were calculated using an updated version of the moog package @xcite that includes updated bound - free opacity data important in the near - uv .",
    "input abundances for the syntheses are scaled to the solar values of @xcite ; for cno , the solar values given above are adopted .",
    "we used scaling factors of [ x / h]@xmath38 and @xmath39 for the hyades and pleiades respectively@xmath40 based upon the @xmath41 [ ] -based cluster dwarf results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the hyades , we assume [ c / h]=@xmath42 based upon initial abundances derived for three dwarfs from and c@xmath43 features @xcite . ] .",
    "table 1 provides the @xmath44 @xmath45 values adopted from the literature and used to smooth the syntheses in addition to a gaussian representing instrumental broadening .",
    "we find a small ( 2 - 4% of the continuum level ) additional continuous veiling is needed to reproduce the depth of the strong non - nh features at 3327.9 , 3328.3 , 3328.9 , 3329.5 , 3329.9  for our hyades stars ; this additional veiling , which might signal a slight deficiency in the bound - free opacity , also substantially improves the line - to - line scatter of the derived n abundances in a manner not mimiced by small plausible adjustments in the continuum normalization or smoothing ( or both ) .",
    "the additional veiling is added to our synthetic spectra by applying an additive constant prior to renormalization .",
    "syntheses and a comparison with observed spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the abundances in each star are determined from several nh features ( or blended group of features ) by fitting each individually .",
    "the scatter in these in a given star provides a combined measure of random measurement error and continuum fitting uncertainties in the derived abundances .",
    "the abundance results are summarized in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the final three columns contain the mean n abundance ( logarithmic by number , on the usual scale where log @xmath46 ) , the number of features / regions used in determining the mean , and the standard deviation of the individual measurements .",
    "the mean logarithmic number abundance of nitrogen for each star is plotted versus @xmath2 in figure 2 , which reveals a modest 0.2 dex trend in the hyades dwarfs over the 5400 - 6200 @xmath2 range .",
    "the non - parametric spearman rank correlation coefficient is significant at @xmath47 confidence level for the hyades data .",
    "we consider three possible sources of this trend .",
    "first is a deficiency in continuous opacity whether truly continuous ( e.g. , bound - free ) opacity or quasi - continuous opacity in the form of myriad very weak lines unnaccounted for in the linelist .",
    "as noted above , we have guarded against such a deficiency by making small effective enhancements in the assumed veiling to reproduce the depths of strong atomic lines and minimize the scatter in the n abundances derived from nh features of different strength .",
    "the second possibility is that our adopted nh dissociation energy is too low .",
    "however , observations of predissociation of electronic states of nh yield a robust upper limit of @xmath48 ev @xcite , a value insignificantly higher than our adopted value .",
    "the third possibility is an origin associated with the @xmath2-dependent abundance trends previously observed in hyades dwarfs .",
    "figures 3 , 5 , and 10 of @xcite show a 0.5 dex monotonic increase in @xmath24fe@xmath49[/h ] @xmath17 [ /h ] , a 0.6 dex increase in -based [ o / h ] values , and a 0.2 dex increase in [ ] -based [ o / h ] values in hyades dwarfs over the @xmath2 range 6000 - 4000 k. whether the trend we see for nh reflects an overdissociation akin to the apparent overexcitation / overionization these other abundances suggest , and what the physical origin of such effects are , remain unclear ; a comparison of li abundances derived from the @xmath50 resonance and @xmath51 subordinate features in pre - main sequence stars , however , strongly suggests the action of enhanced near uv photoionization in cool very young stars @xcite .",
    "regardless , we emphasize that the modest trends in n abundance are not surprising in the context of @xmath2-dependent trends previously seen in the hyades dwarfs .",
    "given the modest @xmath2 trend in the hyades n abundances , we determine the relative pleiades - hyades cluster n difference over the same @xmath52 k @xmath2 range spanned by the four pleiads . for a given cluster , the standard deviation in the mean n abundance over this range , @xmath53 dex for both clusters , empirically estimates internal measurement and relative stellar parameter uncertainties .",
    "this per star estimate is also that expected from the maximum @xmath2 uncertainties of @xcite and @xcite and the typical mean measurement uncertainties calculated from the last 2 columns of tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the unweighted mean cluster n abundances computed over the 5940 - 6180 k range are log @xmath54(n)@xmath55 ( uncertainty in the mean ) and 7.91@xmath35 for the pleiades and hyades , respectively .",
    "weighting the individual abundances by the squared reciprocals of the individual uncertainties in tables 1 and 2 yields indistinguishable mean abundances of log @xmath54(n)@xmath55 ( pleiades ) and 7.90@xmath35 ( hyades ) .",
    "the pleiades @xmath17 hyades difference is then @xmath24log @xmath54(n)@xmath56 , indicating that the pleiades n abundance is smaller than that of the hyades .",
    "the mean cluster fe abundances and their uncertainties from @xcite yield [ n / fe]@xmath57 and @xmath58 for the hyades and pleiades respectively , where the quoted errors reflect internal uncertainties in the mean .",
    "we also consider three sources of systematic error .",
    "first , we note that the solar n abundance was fixed for each feature by slight alterations in the @xmath36 values when calibrating the line list .",
    "thus , the solar - normalized abundances are derived self - consistently , and are @xmath36-independent ; indeed , altering the nh log @xmath36 values by @xmath59 dex , we find differential curve - of - growth effects to be @xmath60 dex .",
    "second , had we not employed the veiling corrections for the hyades stars , then the hyades - pleiades abundance difference would be _ increased _ by @xmath61 dex .",
    "third , systematic differences in dereddened colors at the @xmath61 mag level for @xmath6 are possible ; in this case , the concomitant alteration to the abundances through the adopted @xmath2 values is at the @xmath53 dex level . in sum , we gauge possible systematic errors in our finding of a pleiades n abundance that is lower than that in the hyades to be at the @xmath62 dex level .    the simplest conclusions reached here , then , are that a ) both the hyades and pleiades results are consistent with previous conclusions that [ n / fe]@xmath5 over a range in metallicity in the galactic disk , and b ) after accounting for possible systematic error , the pleiades n abundance ( by number ) is the same as or @xmath63 lower than that of the hyades  thus providing no evidence that the pleiades he abundance ( by mass ) is 40% larger than that of the hyades if indeed n production in the galactic disk is a proxy for he production .",
    "another possible systematic effect that must be considered , however , is the influence of he abundance on the derived n abundances themselves .",
    "that is , we must ask if it is possible that the pleiades he and n abundances might truly be enhanced relative to the hyades , but our derived pleiades n abundance is too low because we have not accounted for such a he enrichment in our analysis .",
    "one effect of such a putative he enhancement would be on the pleiades stellar parameters .",
    "equation 4 of @xcite indicates that an enhancement of @xmath64 ( that needed to explain the pleiades - hyades distance modulus discrepancy ) would lead to a 0.05 mag reduction in @xmath6 colors of solar metallicity @xmath65 pleiades dwarfs .",
    "the dwarfs we compare here are brighter , and an estimate of the color sensitivity for them can be made using the reciprocal and reciprocity theorems to find @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is @xmath6 color , @xmath68 is the effective temperature , and @xmath14 is the he mass fractions ) by taking :   @xmath69 from equation 3 of @xcite , @xmath70 from figure 4 of @xcite , and @xmath71 from the calibration of @xcite .",
    "the result is the same as above , with a @xmath72 increase in he mass fraction leading to a @xmath6 color bluer by 0.05 mag .",
    "the result of such a helium - induced color shift would be to overestimate the pleiades @xmath2 values by @xmath73 k and to underestimate the log @xmath74 values by @xmath75 dex . compensating for these parameter errors , including the effects on [ fe / h ] and the feedback of metallicity on the derived n abundance , would lower our n abundances by @xmath76 .",
    "thus , any such he - induced parameter effects act in the opposite way needed to mask a proposed truly higher pleiades n abundance .",
    "a second effect of a putative higher pleiades he abundance is that on the ( model ) photospheric structure .",
    "we have rerun our analyses using atlas12 model atmospheres with the standard solar he abundance and he abundances enhanced 33% and 75% by number . for stars with @xmath77 k , the he - enhanced atmospheres yield n abundances lowered by 0.04 dex and 0.08 dex compared to the solar he atmospheres ; for stars with @xmath78 k , the reductions are 0.03 and 0.07 dex . just as for the parameter - based effects",
    ", he - induced atmospheric structure effects act in the opposite way needed to mask a proposed truly higher pleiades n abundance .",
    "our analysis of high - resolution and -s / n near - uv spectroscopy yields a pleiades n number abundance that is the same as or up to @xmath79 lower than in the hyades .",
    "this result is consistent with previous abundance work suggesting that [ n / fe ] ratios of local galactic disk stars are solar over a range of [ fe / h ] .",
    "if , as we argue , n production serves as a reliable proxy for he production in the galactic disk , then our results provide no evidence for a pleiades he abundance larger than that of the hyades .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with those reached from the relative pleiades - hyades c , o , and fe abundances in the context of our current understanding of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "this conclusion is also robust against the effects of an unrealized but truly higher pleiades he abundance on model atmospheric structure and our stellar parameters .",
    "if the pleiades distance modulus discrepancy and hyades anomaly are not due to unrealized systematic parallax and photometric measurement errors , then our results suggests their physical explanation is not associated with he abundance .",
