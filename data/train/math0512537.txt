    "the first passage percolation model was introduced in 1965 by hammersley and welsh . in this model , we consider the @xmath0 lattice as a graph with edges connecting each pair of vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the euclidean distance between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we assign independently to each edge a nonnegative _ passage time _",

    "the expectation and variance with respect to @xmath27 are denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "for any two vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 , a path @xmath30 from @xmath5 to @xmath6 is an alternating sequence @xmath31 of vertices @xmath32 and edges @xmath33 between @xmath32 and @xmath34 in @xmath0 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "given such a path @xmath30 , we define its passage time as @xmath37 for any two sets @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we define the passage time from @xmath38 to @xmath39 as @xmath40 where the infimum is over all possible finite paths from some vertex in @xmath38 to some vertex in @xmath39 .",
    "a path @xmath30 from @xmath38 to @xmath39 with @xmath41 is called the _ optimal path _ of @xmath42 .",
    "the existence of such an optimal path has been proven ( see kesten  @xcite ) . we also want to point out that the optimal path may not be unique .",
    "if we focus on a special configuration @xmath43 , we may write @xmath44 instead of @xmath42 . when @xmath45 and @xmath46 are single vertex sets , @xmath4 is the passage time from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "we may extend the passage time over @xmath47 .",

    "define for all @xmath68 , @xmath69 the shape theorem ( see theorem 1.7 of kesten @xcite ) is the well - known result stating that for any @xmath70 , @xmath71 in addition to @xmath72 , we can consider the mean of @xmath73 to be @xmath74 by ( [ e1.4 ] ) , we also have @xmath75    the natural and most challenging aspect in this field ( see kesten @xcite and smythe and wierman @xcite ) is to question the `` speed '' and `` roughness '' of the interface @xmath73 from the deterministic boundaries @xmath72 and @xmath76 .",
    "this problem has also received a great amount of attention from statistical physicists because of its equivalence with one version of the eden growth model .",
    "they believe that there is a scaling relation for the shape fluctuations in growth models . for each unit vector @xmath48 , we may denote by @xmath77 the _ height _ of the interface ( see page 490 in krug and spohn @xcite ) . the initial condition is @xmath78 .",
    "being interested in fluctuation , we consider the height fluctuation function @xmath79    statistical physicists believe that @xmath80 should satisfy ( see ( 3.1 ) in krug and spohn @xcite ) the following scaling property @xmath81 with the scaling exponents @xmath82 and @xmath83 for an arbitrary rescaling factor @xmath84 . with this scaling equation",

    "mathematicians have also made significant efforts in this direction .",
    "when @xmath89 , it is known ( see zhang @xcite ) that @xmath90    when @xmath91 and @xmath2 only takes two values zero and one , it is also known ( see kesten and zhang @xcite ) that @xmath92 in fact , kesten and zhang @xcite showed a clt for the process @xmath93 , a much stronger result than ( [ e1.8 ] ) . for a more general distribution @xmath3 with @xmath91 , @xmath94 can be either convergent or divergent , depending on the behavior of the derivative of @xmath95 at @xmath96 ( see zhang @xcite ) .",
    "now we focus on the most interesting situation : when @xmath7 .",
    "it is widely conjectured ( see ( [ e1.6 ] ) above and kesten @xcite ) that if @xmath7 , then @xmath97 the mathematical estimates for the upper bound of @xmath94 are quite promising .",
    "kesten @xcite showed that if @xmath98 , there is a constant @xmath99 such that @xmath100 in this paper , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are always positive constants that may depend on @xmath3 , but not on @xmath103 , @xmath104 , or @xmath13 .",
    "their values are not significant and change from appearance to appearance .",
    "benjamini , kalai and schramm @xcite also showed that when @xmath2 only takes two values @xmath105 with a half probability for each one , @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the natural logarithm .    on the other hand",
    ", the lower bound of the variance for @xmath94 seems to be much more difficult to estimate . for a high - dimensional lattice ,",
    "there are some discussions for a lower bound of the fluctuations from @xmath73 to @xmath72 ( see zhang @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we would like to focus on the square lattice . to understand the complexity of the lower bound",
    ", we have to deal with the following special distributions investigated by durrett and liggett @xcite .",
    "they defined @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath109 , @xmath110 , so shape @xmath65 is compact . without loss of generality , we can suppose that @xmath111 if we replace @xmath95 by @xmath112 .",
    "in the following , we always assume that @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the critical value for the oriented percolation model .",
    "durrett and liggett @xcite found that shape @xmath65 contains a flat segment on the diagonal direction .",
    "later , marchand @xcite presented the precise locations of the flat segment in the shape when distribution @xmath3 satisfies ( [ e1.10 ] ) .",
    "more precisely , two polar coordinates in the first quadrant are denoted by @xmath115 for @xmath116 ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 is a constant defined in ( 2.4 ) below .",
    "note that @xmath119 if @xmath120 and @xmath121 if @xmath122 .",
    "marchand ( see theorem 1.3 of marchand @xcite ) showed that under ( [ e1.10 ] ) , @xmath123 where the segment will shrink as a point @xmath124 when @xmath125 .",
    "this segment is called the _ flat edge _ of shape @xmath65 .",
    "the cone between @xmath126 and @xmath127 is called the _ oriented percolation cone_. to understand why this is called the oriented percolation cone , we introduce the following oriented paths .",
    "let us define the northeast- and the southeast - oriented paths .",
    "a path ( not necessary to be a @xmath128-path ) is said to be a northeast path if each vertex @xmath5 of the path has only one exiting edge , either from @xmath5 to @xmath129 or to @xmath130 .",
    "similarly , a path is said to be a southeast path if each vertex @xmath5 of the path has only one existing edge , either from @xmath5 to @xmath129 or to @xmath131 .     contains a flat segment when @xmath3 satisfies ( [ e1.10]).[f1 ] ]    for any vector @xmath132 with @xmath133 , under ( [ e1.10 ] ) , with a positive probability , there is a northeast path @xmath30 from @xmath16 to @xmath134 with only 1-edges ( see ( 3.2 ) in yukich and zhang @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we call the cone between @xmath126 and @xmath127 the oriented percolation cone .    with this observation , for @xmath135",
    "( see special case 1 in newman and piza  @xcite ) , there exists a constant @xmath136 such that @xmath137 where both @xmath16 and @xmath138 are polar coordinates . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been proven ( see newman and piza ( 1995 ) ) that if @xmath139 and @xmath140 , or @xmath141 and @xmath142 , then @xmath143 even though ( [ e1.12 ] ) is far from the correct order @xmath144 , it at least tells us that @xmath94 diverges as @xmath145 .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , both the convergence and divergence in ( [ e1.11 ] ) and ( [ e1.12 ] ) indicate the complexity of an estimate for the lower bound of the variance .    from ( [ e1.11 ] ) and ( [ e1.12 ] ) , we may ask the behaviors of the variance for the passage time on a nonoriented percolation cone or simply ask whether with ( [ e1.10 ] ) , for the most popular first passage time @xmath93 , @xmath146 indeed , if there were a proof for ( [ e1.13 ] ) , the proof would be tricky because one has to show that two different behaviors exist in the oriented percolation and the nonoriented percolation cones . as newman and piza ( 1995 ) described , `` either the new techniques , or additional hypotheses seem to need to investigate conjecture  ( [ e1.13 ] ) when ( [ e1.10 ] ) holds . ''",
    "this is the same flavor as the extension of the strict inequality on the time constant ( see van den berg and kesten @xcite ) to the nonoriented percolation cone ( see marchand @xcite ) . in this paper , one of the main works",
    "is to investigate the different behaviors in the oriented and nonoriented percolation cones .",
    "we discovered that , unlike the oriented percolation cone , any long piece with @xmath128-edges in an optimal path from @xmath16 to @xmath17 contains proportional circuitous pieces . with this geometric property",
    ", we will show ( [ e1.13 ] ) .",
    "before we mention our result , we would like to introduce newman and piza s martingale method that was used to show ( [ e1.12 ] ) . to describe their method",
    "simply , we assume that @xmath2 can only take two values @xmath147 and @xmath84 with @xmath148 .",
    "the key to these martingale arguments is to show that there are proportionally many @xmath84-edges in an optimal path .",
    "if we change @xmath84-edges from @xmath84 to @xmath147 , then the passage time will shrink at least @xmath149 from the original passage time .",
    "this tells us why the variance of passage time should be large if the number of @xmath84-edges is large .",
    "the remaining task is to estimate the number of @xmath84-edges .",
    "however , if we assume ( [ e1.10 ] ) holds , it is possible that all edges in any optimal path have value @xmath147 . therefore , the newman and piza method will not be applied .    .",
    "@xmath1 is a @xmath150-edge .",
    "@xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are broken bridges of @xmath156 .",
    "in fact , there are many vertical @xmath12-broken bridges parallel to @xmath157 and @xmath153 , but we will not list all of them in this graph .",

    ", we may guess that an optimal path should not be northeast or southeast since it is not in the oriented percolation cone .",

    "we now select a unique optimal path .",
    "for example , we may start at the origin and select vertices among all optimal paths in each step such that the selected vertex is closer to the @xmath162-axis .",
    "we still write this unique optimal path as @xmath156 , without loss of generality .",
