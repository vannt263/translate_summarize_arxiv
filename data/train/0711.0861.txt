    "quantum degenerate bose gases of dimers consisting both fermionic @xcite and bosonic @xcite constituent atoms , have recently been realized in feshbach resonance @xcite and photoassociation @xcite setups .",
    "first evidence for boson pairing was obtained in seminal experiments in a bec of @xmath4rb atoms @xcite showing ramsey - like oscillations indicative of the coherent coexistence of molecular and atomic condensates .",
    "this experiment was soon followed by the production of much larger and well - defined molecular condensates of @xmath5cs@xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7rb@xmath6 @xcite , and @xmath8na@xmath6 @xcite , as well as ultracold molecular gases and molecular becs with fermionic constituent atoms , such as @xmath9k@xmath6 @xcite and @xmath10li@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "becs of molecules consisting fermionic atoms , turn out to be more stable due to the pauli blocking of collisional relaxation @xcite .",
    "these novel entities open the way for the corroboration of theoretical proposals for , so called , superchemistry @xcite .",
    "the underlying dynamics of atom - molecule conversion in quantum gases , is collective in essence and is therefore strongly affected by the quantum statistics of atoms and molecules . for the purely bosonic system , bose enhancement takes place for atoms and molecules , to result in a nearly exact analogy @xcite with parametric processes in optics , including coherent matter wave amplification , phase conjugation , and quantum state squeezing .",
    "association of atoms to form a condensate of dimers is analogous to second - harmonic generation and the dissociation of a molecular condensate corresponds to parametric downconversion .",
    "the latter pair - production process is known to exhibit a modulational instability , resulting in from the exponential amplification of spontaneously emitted photon - pairs @xcite .",
    "the existence of similar parametric gain in molecular dissociation was noted early on in the theoretical study of atom - molecule condensates @xcite . moreover , since driving the system in the vicinity of a dynamical instability generates gain in quantum noise @xcite , there are significant deviations from the classical - field predictions of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) mean - field theory @xcite",
    ". the rapid growth of correlations can be used for the generation of pair - correlated or number - squeezed atomic beams @xcite using either spontaneously emitted pairs @xcite or a classical atomic ( signal ) seed @xcite , in analogy to the use of parametric downconversion to generate squeezed light in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "recently , we have found that stimulated molecular dissociation can be arrested , provided that atoms are confined to move within an harmonic trap of frequency @xmath11 , whose size @xmath12 is smaller than the resonance healing length @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14,@xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the atomic mass , the atom - molecule coupling strength , and the average molecular density , respectively .",
    "thus , the large coherence length of the molecular bec on the one hand , and the tight confinement available today by magnetic and optical traps on the other hand , conjure to produce collective chemistry which not only depends on particle statistics , but also on the size and shape of the reaction vessel itself . here",
    "we show that for two - channel dissociation of a molecular condensate of triatomic @xmath17 molecules , the critical dependence on the trapping potential can be used to control the dissociation outcome by mere manipulation of the trap parameters , even when the two rearrangement channels are equally coupled to the molecular bec .",
    "thus for sufficiently tight traps , neither channel is amplified . at the other extreme , for trap size larger than the resonance healing - length of both channels , both channels will be amplified . in between these regimes , lies a window where only one channel attains exponential gain , resulting in nearly perfect selectivity .",
    "the exponential gain features of molecular bec dissociation and the possibility to arrest the dissociation of a homonuclear diatomic quantum gas by tight confinement are presented in section [ homonuc ] .",
    "the extension to the case of heteronuclear molecules where dissociation fragments have different masses and optical polarizabilities , resulting in differences in trap - size and healing length , is provided in section [ heteronuc ] . in section [ multi ]",
    "we present the analysis for the two - channel dissociation of a triatomic quantum gas into bosonic constituents and corroborate the analytical prediction by numerical examples .",

    "this value is in an excellent agreement with the prediction above of @xmath83 , despite the fact that the theoretical value is based on a crude approximation for the density .",

    "the actual values from numerical diagonalization turn out to be @xmath222 and @xmath223 indicating that the effect of molecular density - profile variation is negligible . similarly , for @xmath224 , the critical values are multiplied by @xmath225 to give @xmath226 and @xmath227 ( in units of the @xmath219 trap frequency and length ) , compared to numerical values of @xmath228 and @xmath229 , respectively . in figs .",
    "[ fig5]d-[fig5]f we plot a sequence of dynamical calculations keeping @xmath15 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 fixed , and varying the trap frequency from @xmath217 ( fig [ fig5]d ) through @xmath219 ( fig [ fig5]e ) , to @xmath224 ( fig [ fig5]f ) .",
    "this sequence corresponds to a realistic experimental scenario where only the trap frequency is varied and it clearly shows the dependence of the reaction outcome and the channel population ratio , upon the confining potential width . the atomic population at @xmath230 ( in @xmath219 dimensionless frequency units ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] as a function @xmath201 , keeping @xmath212 , @xmath15 and @xmath211 fixed .",
    "it is evident that the ratio between the channel populations can be controlled merely by variation of trap width .     as a function of the widening parameter @xmath201 .",

    "before closing , we assess the relevant experimental parameters required for the observation of the predicted supression of stimulated dissociation by tight confinement . for the majority of feshbach - coupled diatomic systems",
    "the characteristic atom - molecule conversion frequency is much larger than the trap frequency , suggesting they are well - within the strong - coupling , nonlinear domain where stimulated gain should be observed .",
    "one example is the @xmath8na feshbach resonance at 907 g @xcite , where the coupling strength is given by @xmath231 @xcite with @xmath232 , @xmath233 mhz , and @xmath234 bohr .",
    "these values give @xmath235 hz @xmath236 . given a density of @xmath237 @xmath238 , we have @xmath239 khz , far above contemporary trap frequencies ( we note that comparison of this feshbach frequency to the atomic interaction frequency @xmath240 khz , justifies the neglect of atom - atom interactions in our calculations , even for substantial atomic populations and high densities . for @xmath241@xmath238 ,",
    "@xmath242 drops to @xmath243 khz , whereas @xmath244 is only @xmath245 hz ) . for @xmath246",
    "we obtain that @xmath247 , so that stimulated dissociation will be observed for any number of molecules in the condensate .",
    "it may be that a sufficiently weak feshbach resonance can be found amongst the many resonances of @xmath7rb @xcite .",
    "collective dissociation thresholds , can however be observed in optical stimulated - raman experimental setups @xcite . in this type of atom - molecule coupling",
    ", @xmath248 is an effective two - photon rabi frequency .",
    "the one - photon rabi frequencies @xmath249 for the pump ( inducing a bound - bound transition to an intermediate molecular state ) and the stokes ( dissociating the intermediate state via a bound - free transition ) lasers , respectively , are products of laser intensities by overlap integrals consisting of electronic transition dipole moments and franck - condon factors , and @xmath250 is the two - photon detuning from the intermediate bound state .",
    "thus , the effective coupling strength can be controlled with great precision @xcite through the adjustment of laser parameters .",
    "most appealing are systems of molecules in optical lattices @xcite , providing optical coupling to deeply bound internal molecular states , as well as tight trap frequencies of @xmath251 khz .",
    "currently , these experiments seek to avoid collective effects in association by operating in the mott - insulator regime with unit occupation numbers",
    ". however , provided that molecular condensates containing roughly @xmath252 particles per site be formed , their dissociation can demonstrate the expected amplification threshold .    for @xmath253 @xmath7rb@xmath6 molecules in a @xmath254 khz trap",
    ", the critical value @xmath255 of the interaction strength turns out to be approximately @xmath256 hz @xmath236 .",
    "the corresponding average atomic density is of order @xmath257 @xmath238 and @xmath258 bohr for @xmath7rb .",
    "therefore , @xmath259 hz for a fully dissociated gas , and atomic interactions are initially negligible with respect to the trap and coupling frequencies.one possible experiment will involve the preparation of a molecular bec in a trap smaller than the resonance healing length , thus arresting dissociation even in the presence of coupling .",
    "a sudden change either in @xmath15 or in @xmath11 ( which in a lattice can be achieved via switching the lattice wavelength or depth ) will trigger the stimulated dissociation of the bec @xcite .    while similar values for the critical parameters apply to the case of heteronuclear diatomic molecules , it is more difficult to estimate the pertinent experimental parameters for the heteronuclear triatomics described in section [ multi ] , due to the lack of experimental or theoretical values for the required feshbach resonance strengths .",
    "the realization of dilute bose condensed gases has produced ensembles with unprecedented mesoscopic coherence lengths of the order of several @xmath260 .",
    "these healing lengths are comparable with characteristic confining potential lengths , suggesting a wealth of interesting phenomena , such as the stabilization of condensates of attractively interacting atoms @xcite and the generation of matter - wave solitons .",
    "the production of molecular becs @xcite opens the way for the utilization of this macroscopic coherence to generate a novel type of collective superchemistry , in which atoms are not treated individually but as one mesoscopic , coherent entity @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown that bose stimulation effects should dominate atom - molecule dynamics in degenerate quantum bose gases .",
    "it was found that the resulting exponential gain produces extremely heightened selectivity in multichannel processes @xcite and can lead to pattern formation in molecular dissociation @xcite .",
    "atom - molecule coupling is characterized by a resonance healing length .",
    "if confining trap sizes become comparable with this length , the molecular bec can be stabilized against dissociation in the same way an attractively interacting bec is stabilized against collapse @xcite . in this work we have used this stabilization effect to show that confinement can also be used to control multichannel dissociation .",
    "differences in mass and polarizability of the dissociation fragments produce differences in the resonance healing lengths and effective trap lengths of the various rearrangement channels , resulting in different amplification thresholds , even when the coupling strengths are equal .",
    "consequently , the channel population ratio depends critically on the trap width and geometry .",
    "this effect highlights another novel feature of superchemistry in that reaction yields depend on reaction vessels .",
