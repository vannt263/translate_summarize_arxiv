    "quenched disorder is expected to smooth phase transitions in many situations .",

    "ma argument @xcite , made rigorous by aizenman and wehr @xcite , implies that these models do not exhibit , at any temperature , the first order phase transition with associated spontaneous magnetization which characterizes the corresponding pure models . for the analogous phenomenon for sos effective interface models",
    "see @xcite .    in the present work , under some conditions on the disorder distribution",
    ", we prove that a similar effect takes place in models of directed polymers in random media exhibiting a localization / delocalization transition on a defect line .",
    "such a transition may be of first or higher order in the corresponding pure , i.e. non  disordered , cases and we show that , as soon as disorder is present , the transition is at least of second order .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the mechanism inducing the smoothing of the transition in our case is very different from the imry ",
    "ma one , and it is rather based on an estimate of the probability that the polymer visits rare but very favorable regions where the disorder produces a large positive fluctuation of the partition function .",
    "we will consider mainly two classes of models : random pinning ( or wetting ) models and random copolymers at selective interfaces . in pinning models @xcite the typical situation",
    "one has in mind is that of a directed path in @xmath1 dimensions , which receives a reward ( or a penalty ) at each intersection with a @xmath4dimensional region ( a _ defect line _",
    ", in the physical language ) according to whether the charge present on the line at the intersection point is positive or negative . on the other hand the copolymer model ,",
    "whose study was initiated in @xcite in the theoretical physical literature ( see @xcite and references therein for updated physics developments ) and in @xcite in the mathematical one , aims at modeling a @xmath0dimensional , directed heteropolymer containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic components , in presence of an interface ( the line @xmath5 in the notations of section [ sec : model_c ] ) separating two solvents , situated in the upper and lower half  planes ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "one solvent favors the hydrophilic components and the other favors the hydrophobic ones , i.e. , if the charge of the @xmath8th monomer is positive ( negative ) , this monomer tends to be in the upper ( lower ) half  plane .",
    "the main question one would like to answer is whether or not the interaction induces a localization of the polymer along the defect line or interface .",

    "we advise the reader who feels uneasy with the weak requirement to focus on the case of @xmath37 behaving like @xmath38 , possibly times a _ slowly varying function _ ( see appendix  [ app : b0 ] ) .",
    "note that , for @xmath39 , the return times to zero of @xmath27 are not integrable .",

    "further assumptions on @xmath55 will be formulated in section [ sec : smooth ] , where we state our main results .    under the above assumptions on the disorder the _ quenched free energy _ of the model exists , namely the limit @xmath61 exists @xmath62almost surely and in the @xmath63 sense .",
    "the existence of this limit can be proven via standard super  additivity arguments based on kingman s sub  additive ergodic theorem @xcite ( we refer for example to @xcite for details ) .",
    "this approach yields also automatically the so called _ self  averaging _ property of the free energy , that is the fact that @xmath64 is non random .",

    "the proof of suggests the following partition of the parameter space ( or _ phase diagram _ ) :    * the localized region : @xmath67 ; * the delocalized region : @xmath68 .",
    "we set @xmath69 , and we will call @xmath70 the _",
    "critical point_. since @xmath71 is not increasing and continuous , @xmath72 .",

    "in particular , by , the free energy is unaffected by the presence of the constraint @xmath77 : we stick to the constrained case because it simplifies some technical steps of the proofs .    for ease of exposition",
    "we have used the generic denomination of _ pinning model _ , but our framework , as it is possibly clearer when the partition function is cast in the form , includes a variety of models , like for example the poland  scheraga model of dna denaturation , for which theoretical arguments on models with excluded volume interactions suggest a value of @xmath78 larger than @xmath79 @xcite : note that whether the transition in the disordered case is of first or higher order is a crucial and controversial issue in the field , see for example @xcite .",
    "we stress also that , since we can choose @xmath80 , it is rather easy to see that also the disordered @xmath0dimensional interface wetting models @xcite enter the general class we are considering .",
    "it is known that the nonrandom case @xmath81 is exactly solvable and that , according to the law of @xmath82 , the transition at @xmath83 can be either of first or higher order . for completeness and to match our set  up , we give a quick self  contained analysis of this case in appendix [ app : b0 ] .      in the case of the copolymer model ,",
    "the natural setting is to assume , in addition , that the state space of the process @xmath84 is @xmath41 , that the law @xmath12 is invariant under the transformation @xmath85 and that @xmath86 for every @xmath87 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath88 is a sequence of iid variables then it is a classical result  ( * ? ? ? * ch .",

    "the copolymer model is defined introducing @xmath96 with the convention that @xmath97 , and the corresponding partition function @xmath98.\\ ] ] we may assume without loss of generality that both @xmath99 and @xmath100 are nonnegative .",
    "the factor @xmath101 in is introduced just for convenience ( see section [ sec : prova_cop ] ) . as in section",
    "[ sec : model_p ] , the corresponding random model is obtained by choosing @xmath54 as a realization of an iid sequence of centered random variables of unit variance and finite exponential moments . in analogy with and",
    ", the limit @xmath102 exists @xmath62almost surely and in the @xmath63 sense and one can prove as in that @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , also in this case we can partition the phase diagram into a localized and a delocalized phase , as    * the localized region : @xmath67 ; * the delocalized region : @xmath104 .    also in this case , we set @xmath69 and we observe that @xmath105 .",
    "many results have been proven for copolymers at selective interfaces , but they are almost always about the case of simple random walks .",
    "however they can be extended in a rather straightforward way to the general case we consider here ( we omit the details also because they are not directly pertinent to the content of this paper ) . above all we have",
    "that @xmath106 for every @xmath107 .",
    "even more , the explicit bounds carry over to the general @xmath27 we consider here : the upper bound @xcite is even independent of the choice of the law of @xmath27 , while the lower bound @xcite depends on @xmath78 .",
    "we take this opportunity to stress also that various results about path behavior in the two regions are available , both for the pinning problem and for the copolymer , and , once again , mostly in the simple random walk case @xmath45 . for instance",
    ", it is known that in @xmath108 long excursions of the walk from the line @xmath5 are exponentially suppressed and the fraction of sites where the polymer crosses the line remains nonzero in the thermodynamic limit ( e.g. , cf @xcite and references therein , and @xcite ) . on the other hand , in the interior of @xmath109",
    "the number of intersections is , in a suitable sense , @xmath110 @xcite and , for the copolymer , the number of steps where @xmath111 is also @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "while the free energy can be proven to be infinitely differentiable with respect to all of its parameters in the region @xmath108 @xcite , no results are available about its regularity at the critical point , apart from the obvious fact that @xmath112 is continuous since it is convex .",
    "the result of the present paper partly fills this gap , showing that the transition is at least of second order , as soon as disorder is present .    in order to state our main theorem ,",
    "we need some further assumptions on the disorder variables @xmath113 .",
    "we will consider two distinct cases :    * c * :    _ bounded random variables_. the random variable @xmath114 is bounded , @xmath115    _ unbounded continuous random variables_. the law of @xmath116 has a density @xmath117 with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath118 , and there exists @xmath119 such that @xmath120 in a neighborhood of @xmath121 .",
    "this is true in great generality whenever @xmath117 is positive , for example when the disorder is gaussian and , more generally , whenever @xmath122 , with @xmath123 a polynomial bounded below .",
    "then , one has : [ c1c2 ]    [ th : smooth_cont ] under condition * c1 * or * c2 * , both for the copolymer and for the pinning model , for every @xmath124 there exists @xmath125 , possibly depending on @xmath55 , such that for every @xmath126 @xmath127 if @xmath128 .",
    "although the above result , coupled of course with , seems to be in the same spirit as the rounding effect proven by aizenman and wehr @xcite for the two  dimensional random field ising model , the physical mechanisms of smoothing are deeply different in the two cases . while @xcite is based on a rigorous version of the imry - ma argument @xcite ( i.e. , a comparison between the effect of boundary conditions and of disorder fluctuations in the bulk due to the random magnetic field ) in our case the boundary conditions play no role at all and everything is based on an energy  entropy argument inspired by @xcite .",
    "it is important to observe that , as explained in appendix [ app : b0 ] , in the pinning case the deterministic model , @xmath129 , has a _ first order phase transition _ whenever @xmath130 @xcite , in particular when @xmath131 .",
    "theorem [ th : smooth_cont ] therefore shows that the disorder has really a smoothing effect on the transition .",
    "but more than that is true : for @xmath132 , @xmath133 at @xmath134 is strictly less regular than @xmath135 at @xmath70 . in fact @xmath136 for @xmath137 and small values of @xmath138 ( for sharper results ,",
    "see appendix [ app : b0 ] ) .",
    "notice that this is in agreement with the so  called _ harris criterion _ @xcite , which predicts that arbitrarily weak disorder modifies the nature of a second  order phase transition as soon as the critical exponent of the specific heat in the pure case is positive . in the present situation , this condition corresponds just to @xmath139 .",
    "the harris criterion also predicts that the critical behavior does not change if @xmath140 , which is compatible with theorem [ th : smooth_cont ] .",
    "rigorous work connected to the harris criterion , in the ising model context , may be found in @xcite .",
    "as one realizes easily from the proof of theorem [ th : smooth_cont ] given in section [ sez : prova ] , the constant @xmath141 in can be very large ( of order @xmath142 ) for @xmath143 small .",
    "this is rather intuitive : for @xmath144 one approaches the deterministic situation , where the transition can be of first order .    in the theoretical physics literature ,",
    "the ( de)localization transition is claimed to be in some cases of order higher than two @xcite , or even of infinite order @xcite .",
    "the method we present here , which is rather insensitive to the details of the model , does not allow to prove more than second order in general .",
    "it is likely that finer results require model  specific techniques .    _ a generalized model : copolymers with adsorption_. it is also possible to consider copolymer models with an additional pinning interaction @xcite , as @xmath145 here , both @xmath54 and @xmath146 are sequences of iid centered random variables with unit variance and finite exponential moments . in addition , one assumes @xmath54 to be independent from @xmath146 .",
    "this model corresponds to the situation where the interface between the two solvents is not neutral .",
    "while for simplicity we will not present details for this model , we sketch here what happens in this case . in analogy with the previous models , one can partition the phase diagram ( i.e. , the space of the parameters @xmath147 ) into a localized and a delocalized region , separated by a _",
    "critical surface_. in this case , theorem [ th : smooth_cont ] is easily generalized to give that the free energy @xmath148 has continuous first derivatives with respect to @xmath149 when these parameters approach the critical surface from the localized region .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ th : smooth_cont ] for the pinning case , and in the next one we explain how the proof can be immediately extended to the copolymer model .",
