    "in the normal state of high-@xmath1 superconductors ( htsc s ) , various quantities deviate from the conventional fermi liquid behaviors . @xcite these non - fermi liquid features",

    "for example , the electrical resistivity ( @xmath8 ) and the longitudinal nmr relaxation rate ( @xmath9 ) in htsc show universally the behaviors @xmath10 , @xmath11 for a wide range of temperatures .",
    "@xcite these are quite different from the conventional fermi liquid behaviors , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .    in htsc s , the hall coefficient ( @xmath0 ) also shows an interesting non - fermi liquid behavior : it shows a drastic temperature dependence although the fermi surface ( fs ) in htsc is non - degenerate and its shape is simple . at high temperatures ( @xmath14k )",

    "@xcite the doping dependence of @xmath0 is also very small there .    on the other hand ,",
    "as the temperature decreases , @xmath0 begins to show a curie - weiss type temperature dependence , and its maximum value is a few times larger than @xmath15 at the optimum - doping .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath0 further increases in the under - doped region . in the hole - doped compounds , e.g. , yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath16 ( ybco ) or la@xmath17sr@xmath18cuo@xmath19 ( lsco ) , @xmath20",
    "is observed and @xmath0 is positive for a wide range of temperatures .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , @xmath21 is realized in the electron - doped compounds , e.g. , nd@xmath17ce@xmath18cuo@xmath19 ( ncco ) , so the sign of @xmath0 changes to negative at a low temperature although its fs is hole - like .",
    "@xcite figure [ fig : sato ] shows a summary of experimental results of lsco and ncco in the under - doped region , where an approximate electron - hole symmetry is realized .",
    "@xcite in both compounds , @xmath22 increases near the half - filling .",
    "the hall effect is one of the unsolved problems in htsc .",
    "its unusual features mentioned above are summarized as follows : ( i ) the curie - weiss type behavior of @xmath0 in a quite wide range of temperatures .",
    "( ii ) the enhancement of @xmath0 in the under - doped region . (",
    "iii ) @xmath23 in the electron - doped compounds .    nowadays ,",
    "various non - fermi liquid phenomena of htsc have been explained by using different types of spin - fluctuation theories , e.g. , the scr theory , @xcite the spin - fluctuation model , @xcite and the flex theory .",
    "@xcite they can explain a reasonable @xmath1 of the @xmath24 superconductivity .",
    "they can also explain the pseudo gap formation in the density of states , @xcite the shadow band formation , @xcite and the collective modes emerging below @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    so far , various attempts have been made on the hall effect in htsc .",
    "@xcite some of them are in the framework of the spin fluctuation model , by using the boltzmann transport approximation ( or one - loop approximation ) .",
    "@xcite however , the boltzmann approximation can not explain the magnitude of @xmath25 in the under - doped region .",

    "this result contradicts with the experiments , shown in fig . [",
    "fig : sato ] .",
    "therefore , the behavior of @xmath0 noted as ( i)-(iii ) above have casted some suspicion on the validity of the nearly af fermi liquid description for the htsc .    in this paper",
    ", we study the hall effect of htsc s based on a conserving approximation .",
    "@xcite we use the expressions for the conductivity and the hall conductivity derived from the kubo formula .",
    "@xcite then , we study the vertex corrections for the current according to the conserving approximation , and find out that they show a critical behavior as a natural consequence of the strong backward scatterings by the af fluctuations . by virtue of this fact ,",
    "we succeed in explaining the overall features of @xmath0 , noted as ( i)-(iii ) above , without assuming a non - fermi liquid ground state .",
    "we also find that the conventional boltzmann approximation , where the conservation laws are violated , can not reproduce any of ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "we analyze the extended hubbard model as an effective model for htsc s .",
    "we use the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation to calculate the green function and the self - energy .",

    "@xcite moreover , the approximate relations @xmath45 , @xmath46 are derived in the nearly af fermi liquid .",
    "so , the experimental non - fermi liquid behaviors of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are naturally explained by the spin - fluctuation theories .",
    "one may also expect that the anomalous behavior of @xmath0 in htsc comes from the @xmath47-dependence of @xmath32 . in this paper , we find that @xmath48 is realized through the vertex corrections for the current .",

    "[ fig : rh ] , the overall features of @xmath0 in each compounds are reproduced quite well .",
    "especially , both the relations @xmath391 and @xmath392 are obtained at the same time .",
    "we have found that @xmath23 is realized in ncco because the cold spots in ncco locate around the bz - boundaries , which may be verified by arpes experiments .",
    "the vertex corrections mentioned above are not included in the boltzmann approximation .",
    "we have confirmed that the hall coefficient given by the boltzmann approximation @xmath363 remains of order @xmath393 if we take the @xmath47-dependence of the fs into account correctly .",
    "( see fig.[fig : rh ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath363 remains positive because the fs is hole - like everywhere . in conclusion ,",
    "the anomalous behaviors of @xmath0 in htsc is reproducible only if the vertex corrections for the current are taken into account .    here",
    ", we discuss the validity of the relation @xmath394 . in a conserving approximation ( including the flex approximation ) the interaction @xmath212 which gives im@xmath330 also determine the mt - type vertex corrections for @xmath3 , as shown by eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : delta ] ) and ( [ eqn : jjj ] ) .",
    "this condition leads to @xmath395 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bs_simple ] ) , which strongly suggests that the relation @xmath394 will be valid beyond the flex approximation .",
    "now we assume that it is valid near the half - filling case ( @xmath299 ) .",
    "then , the experimental relation @xmath396 can be understood because @xmath397 is observed experimentally near the half - filling .",
    "next , we consider the hall coefficient below the pseudo spin - gap temperature , @xmath35 , where @xmath0 in ybco decreases as @xmath47 decreases experimentally .",
    "it is also understandable because @xmath32 slightly decreases below @xmath35 experimentally .",
    "@xcite    we also find that the resistivity is slightly enhanced by the vertex corrections for the current .",
    "moreover , we obtain the expression of the incoherent conductivity @xmath398 , which is given by the second term of eq.([eqn : s_numerical ] ) . in the case of @xmath298 , which is satisfied in htsc s",

    "@xcite , it is shown that a similar numerical study based on the af spin - fluctuation model also leads to the enhancement of @xmath0 , by using the set of spin fluctuation parameters consistent with experiments .",
    "although the conserving laws are not satisfied exactly in that study , it confirms the importance of the vertex corrections for the current .",
    "it also indicates that the numerical results presented in this paper should not be taken as an artifact specific to the flex approximation .",
    "now we would like to discuss @xmath0 in heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds .",
    "in various paramagnetic compounds , @xmath0 shows a drastic temperature dependence and takes an enhanced value .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures , the relation @xmath403 is observed in many compounds , and @xmath404 is always positive .",
    "it is explained in terms of the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) , which originates from the localized @xmath405-orbital angular momentum , and its enhancement factor is given by @xmath406 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , in some hf compounds with af ground state , the relation @xmath403 @xmath407 is not satisfied and the sign of @xmath408 at @xmath409 changes depending on compounds .",

    "@xcite we stress that the normal hall effect can exceed the ahe and @xmath410 will be realized in these nearly antiferromagnetic hf compounds , where @xmath411 is realized .",
    "we note that @xmath412 in three dimension is obtained by the scr theory .",
    "we also comment on the @xmath7-bedt - ttf organic superconductors .",
    "the recent studies by the flex approximation reveal that the large af fluctuations are the origin of the @xmath413-wave superconductivity .",
    "@xcite recent experiments show that the @xmath0 of this system increases as @xmath47 decreases @xcite , which can be reproduced well by using the analysis of this paper .",
