    "symmetrization is one of the most basic and powerful tools in probability theory , particularly in the study of sums of random variables , see ledoux and talagrand ( 1991 )",
    ". using symmetrization techniques , some important results about symmetric random variables can be extended to more general situations , for example lvy - type inequalities , lvy - it - nisio theorem , etc .",
    "this note is motivated by a recent paper of schultze and weizscher , in which they proved that for arbitrary symmetric random walk in @xmath7 with independent increment the probability of crossing a level at given time @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "the following distribution free symmetrization inequality played an important role in removing the symmetry assumption . for i.i.d .",
    "real random variables @xmath0 , they proved @xmath10 as mentioned by schultze and weizscher , the mere existence of a symmetrization constant for higher dimensional version of ( 1 ) follows from the estimate ( 29 ) of mattner ( 1996 ) . in this note , we extend the inequality to the general banach space setting . in this context ,",
    "our extension is useful in investigating analogous phenomena of random walks in banach space , although we do not have a close study of this problem in the current paper .",
    "moreover , our estimates are tight for real random variables as well as when @xmath5 is equipped with the @xmath6 norm . the same approach is used to generalize a result of alon and yuster ( 1995 ) : for all i.i.d .",
    "real random variables @xmath0 , @xmath11 this answered a question of g. a. margulis and y. peres .",
    "moreover , alon and yuster showed the connection between optimal constants in such inequalities and kissing numbers , which have a long history of study ; the kissing number in @xmath12 was a subject of discussion between isaac newton and david gregory in 1694 .",
    "in addition , such estimates can be used to obtain moment inequalities involving certain classes of functions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . these and other applications will be studied in our subsequent paper .",
    "let @xmath15 be a separable banach space , and @xmath16 be two subsets of @xmath17 .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the set consisting of all elements in @xmath19 but not in @xmath20 .",
    "their sum is defined by @xmath21 for @xmath22 , we define the @xmath23-covering number of @xmath19 by @xmath20 in the following way @xmath24 the usual definition of the diameter of @xmath20 is @xmath25 and the inner radius is defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the closed ball centered at the origin with radius @xmath28 . in general , we denote by @xmath29 the closed ball centered at @xmath30 with radius @xmath28 .",

    "the extension of ( 1 ) is given in the following theorem .",
    "for @xmath43 and i.i.d .",
    "real random variables @xmath0 , we have @xmath44 moreover , the constant @xmath45 can not be improved . when @xmath46 , the inequality is still tight with @xmath47 in the middle .",
    "it is not hard to see that theorem 2 and the estimate ( 2 ) imply the following sharp inequalities .    for @xmath43 and i.i.d .",
    "@xmath48-valued random vectors @xmath0 with independent entries , we have @xmath49 for all @xmath50 , we have @xmath51",
    "the following lemma was proved by schultze and weizscher , which shows how to derive two - variable inequalities from one - variable estimate .",
    "we state the lemma in a form suitable for our purpose .",
    "let @xmath52 be a measurable space and @xmath53 be a @xmath54 measurable bounded symmetric function .",
    "let @xmath55 be the set of all probability measures on @xmath56 .",
    "then the following statements are equivalent :    * for all @xmath57 , @xmath58 * for all @xmath57 , @xmath59    ( theorem 1 ) : we use @xmath55 to denote the set of all probability measures on @xmath17 . without confusion ,",
    "we let @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "apparently , the theorem is true for @xmath62 . in the following ,",
    "we always assume @xmath63 is finite . in order to prove ( 6 )",
    ", we only need to show that for any constant @xmath64 , @xmath65 for all i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath0 . the inequality above can be rewritten as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath57 is induced by @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath20 is symmetric , we can see @xmath69 is symmetric and bounded . by lemma 1 , it is equivalent to prove @xmath70 for all @xmath57 .",
    "assume otherwise , then there exists some @xmath57 such that @xmath71 , where @xmath72 let s define @xmath73 since @xmath32 and @xmath31 is separable , there exists a countable subset @xmath74 such that @xmath75 , which implies @xmath76 . for @xmath77 small , we can pick @xmath78 such that @xmath79 by the definition of @xmath63 , there exists a subset @xmath80 such that @xmath81 so we have @xmath82 from ( 18 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 19 ) , we have @xmath83 since @xmath71 , for any set @xmath84 with positive measure , there is @xmath85 next we will show @xmath86 by ( 21 ) , there exists @xmath87 such that @xmath88 . for any @xmath89 , @xmath90 which implies the first part of ( 22 ) .",
    "the second part follows from the assumption on @xmath20 and the definition of @xmath91 . combining ( 20)-(22 ) , we have @xmath92 taking @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 which contradicts the definition of @xmath95 in ( 17 ) .",
    "so we proved ( 6 ) .",
    "+ to prove ( 7 ) , we only need to make a slight modification of the previous proof .",
    "similar to ( 13 ) , we need to prove that for any @xmath96 , @xmath97 instead of ( 16 ) , we redefine @xmath98 and @xmath95 is defined in the same way as in ( 17 ) . for @xmath77 small , we can pick @xmath78 such that @xmath79 by the definition of @xmath63 , there exists a subset @xmath99 such that @xmath100 hence @xmath101 from ( 26 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 27 ) , we have @xmath102 combining ( 28 ) , ( 29 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) , we have @xmath103 taking @xmath93 , we get ( 23 ) again , which is in contradiction to the definition of @xmath95 .",
    "so we proved ( 7 ) .",
    "for @xmath104 $ ] , @xmath105 $ ] , we can see @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in this case",
    ", theorem 1 implies a slight weaker version of theorem 2 without the strict inequality in the middle of ( 10 ) . when @xmath46 , the following trivial example shows that the equality can indeed happen .",
    "when @xmath0 have the same distribution @xmath108 , it is easy to see @xmath109 . for @xmath43",
    ", we will extend the proof of ( 1 ) by schultze and weizscher in the following section .",
    "if the claim is not true , there is some @xmath111 such that @xmath71 , where @xmath115 define @xmath116 , which is positive . for @xmath77 small",
    ", we will show that there exists a sequence of disjoint intervals @xmath117 such that @xmath118 for @xmath119 large enough , we have @xmath120 which is impossible .",
    "so the claim must be true .",

    "so it can be covered by @xmath131 $ ] for some @xmath132 .",
    "then we can see that every interval above has measure at most @xmath95 , which implies @xmath133 for any @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 and @xmath136 when @xmath137 , we always have @xmath138 for @xmath139 , we can see @xmath140 combining ( 33)-(35 ) , we have @xmath141)&\\geq&\\mu_b(-x_1)-\\mu_1(x_0)>\\alpha-\\lceil 2b\\rceil^2\\epsilon.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath142 , we have @xmath143 in this case , we also have @xmath144)\\geq \\alpha-\\lceil 2b\\rceil^2\\epsilon.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , we can define @xmath145~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1/2<b\\leq 1,\\\\ ( -x_1-b-1+\\lceil 2b\\rceil , -x_1+b]~~~~~~b>1 . \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apparently , we have @xmath146 .",
    "proceeding recursively we can construct a sequence of disjoint intervals @xmath117 with properties as we mentioned before .",
    "so , the claim is true .      in the following , we construct an example which shows that our estimate in theorem 2 is sharp .",
