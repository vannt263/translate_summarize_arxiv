    "there are , currently , three neutrino puzzles , two which strongly indicate the presence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . the oldest one  the solar neutrino puzzle @xcite is the fact that the flux of electron - type solar neutrinos measured at the earth is significantly smaller than predicted by solar physics models .",
    "this deficit is confirmed by different experiments , which make use of very different techniques for detecting neutrinos .",
    "it is fair to say that , after the publication of the first results from sno @xcite , there is very strong evidence for a flux of @xmath0 coming from the sun .",
    "the second  the atmospheric neutrino puzzle @xcite  is the fact that the flux of atmospheric muon - type neutrinos and antineutrinos differs significantly from theoretical predictions .",
    "this anomalous behaviour was first observed by the proton decay experiments imb and kamiokande , and later confirmed and firmly established by the superkamiokande experiment .",
    "the anomaly manifests itself more strongly in the ratio of the predicted @xmath1 and @xmath2 flux - ratio to the experimentally measured one , and the nontrivial angular dependency of the @xmath2 flux .",
    "the latter is by far the most striking evidence for physics beyond the sm we have at the moment .",
    "finally , the lsnd experiment @xcite , which studies neutrinos produced after pion and muon decays , has observes a 3-sigma excess of @xmath3-like events from @xmath4 decays . the lsnd anomaly has not been confirmed or excluded by karmen @xcite or other neutrino experiments .",
    "the situation will improve significantly with the advent of the miniboone @xcite experiment , which is due to start taking data in 2002 .",
    "the neutrino puzzles are best solved by assuming that the neutrinos have mass , and that neutrino mass eigenstates and weak eigenstates differ , hence the neutrinos `` oscillate . ''",
    "the solar neutrino puzzle is best solved by assuming @xmath5 oscillations @xcite , while the atmospheric neutrino puzzle hints at quasi - maximal @xmath6 oscillations @xcite .",
    "the lsnd anomaly requires @xmath7 oscillations .",
    "there are , however , other exotic solutions to individual neutrino puzzles in the market , such as new neutrino  matter interactions , violation of lorentz invariance and quantum mechanics , and neutrino decays , to name a few .",
    "usually , these solutions are tailor - made to address a particular neutrino puzzle .",
    "it is fair to say that neutrino oscillations is the only hypothesis that can properly address _ all _ neutrino anomalies .    in this talk , i review some aspects of neutrino oscillations . in the next section ,",
    "i discuss neutrino mixing and how it leads to neutrino flavour conversion , both in the absence and presence of a medium .",
    "i concentrate on two and three family mixing scenarios , and spend some time discussing the `` physical parameter space . '' in sec .",
    "[ sec : at_work ] , i briefly review how neutrino oscillations solve the neutrino puzzles , and what the current data can and can not tell us about the oscillation parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lsnd ] , i discuss some of the issues that must be faced if the lsnd anomaly is also to be explained by neutrino oscillations , and in sec .  [ sec : outlook ] i conclude with an outlook regarding what we may expect to learn in the next few years and what will be left to do with future , more powerful , machines ( neutrino factories ? ) .",
    "if neutrinos have mass , there is no reason for the mass eigenstates to coincide with the weak ( also referred to as flavour ) eigenstates .",
    "this not being the case , the two bases are connected by a unitary matrix @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are weak eigenstates ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 are mass eigenstates , with masses @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath14 will be referred to as the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "note that one can choose to label the mass eigenstates _ in ascending order of mass - squared , _ with no loss of generality",
    ". this will be assumed , unless otherwise noted .",
    "when neutrinos propagate in vacuum , it is very simple to calculate the probability that a neutrino with energy @xmath15 , which is produced as a weak eigenstate @xmath9 , is detected a distance @xmath16 from the source as a weak eigenstate @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the mass - squared differences . for antineutrinos , one simply has to replace @xmath20 , meaning that eq .",
    "( [ pab ] ) holds as long as the sign of the last term is flipped .",
    "one can define the different oscillation lengths @xmath21.\\ ] ]    figure  [ explain ] depicts @xmath22 as a function of @xmath23 for different values of @xmath15 .",
    "[ explain ]    when the neutrinos propagate in matter ( of either constant or varying density ) the situation is significantly altered , as will be discussed in the next two subsections .      if there are oscillation between only two neutrino states , the situation is rather simple .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix is parametrised in terms of only one angle @xmath24 , and one extra phase if the neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "this phase , however , is not observable in oscillation phenomena , and may be safely set to zero .",
    "explicitly , if there is mixing only between @xmath1 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27    in the presence of neutrino  medium interactions , the neutrino propagation is modified @xcite .",
    "these effects can be expressed in terms of a `` matter potential , '' such that neutrino propagation is governed by the following schdinger - like equation ( in the weak basis ) , @xmath28 \\left(\\matrix{\\nu_{e } \\cr \\nu_{x } } \\right ) , \\label{de_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 are the different matter potential functions , which are in principle a function of the position .",
    "if @xmath30 is a linear combination of the other active neutrinos ( @xmath2 and @xmath31 ) , the matter potential matrix is such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 , ) is defined up to a term proportional to the identity matrix , which does not yield any physically observable effect . ]",
    "if the neutrinos propagate in `` normal '' matter with electron number density @xmath34 , and only standard model ( sm ) interactions are taken into account .",
    "for antineutrinos , @xmath34 is replaced by @xmath35 ( which is the positron number density ) .",
    "two important issues can be addressed just by inspecting the general form of eq .",
    "( [ de_2 ] ) .",
    "first of all , while eq .",
    "( [ de_2 ] ) is , in principle , not solvable , we can still construct useful relations between the different @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , because the `` hamiltonian '' is hermitian ( this condition would break down , for example , in the presence of neutrino absorption by the medium or if the neutrinos decay ) , @xmath37 .",
    "this implies , in the case of two neutrino oscillations , that only one @xmath36 is independent .",
    "for example , one can express all @xmath36 in terms of @xmath38 : @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "it is curious to note that , in the case of two family oscillation , @xmath41 ( t - invariance ) is guaranteed , while nothing , in principle , prevents @xmath42 ( matter induced cp - violation ) .",
    "second , it is interesting to define what is the `` physical range '' for the oscillation parameter @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ what are the values of @xmath24 which yield , if one measures @xmath43 , distinct results ? initially , because @xmath24 is an angle , it need be defined only from 0 to @xmath44 . on top of this , it is trivial to check that the transformation @xmath45 is equivalent to @xmath46 , in the sense that the differential equations eq .",
    "( [ de_2 ] ) transform in exactly the same way .",
    "this implies that choosing values of @xmath47 $ ] is enough ( this may also be seem by noting that eq .",
    "( [ de_2 ] ) depends only on @xmath48 , up to irrelevant terms proportional to the unit matrix ) .",
    "furthermore , _ if the matter potential matrix is diagonal , _ the transformation @xmath45 modifies the differential equations in such a way that @xmath49 . because @xmath50 assuming the boundary condition is a pure @xmath9 state at @xmath51 , @xmath24 and @xmath52 yield the same @xmath43 , and the physical parameter space can be safely restricted to @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "this is _ not _ that case if the matter potential has off - diagonal terms and/or if the `` weak '' eigenstates at the production point differ from the `` weak '' eigenstates at the detection point .",
    "this is not the case within the sm , but in extensions to it one may indeed be able to distinguish @xmath24 from @xmath52 . finally , in the absence of a matter potential ( which is the case of vacuum oscillations ) , there is yet another `` symmetry : '' @xmath54 , such that the entire physical parameter space can be spanned by allowing @xmath24 to vary from 0 to @xmath55 .",
    "this can be explicitly seen in eq .",
    "( [ p_2nus ] ) .",
    "the parameter space in the absence of physics beyond the sm is easy to interpret . in the region",
    "@xmath56 $ ] ( the light side ) @xmath1 is `` predominantly light '' ( @xmath57 ) , while when @xmath58 $ ] ( the dark side ) @xmath1 is `` predominantly heavy '' ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "while pure vacuum oscillations can not tell the dark from the light side , matter effects brek the degeneracy and allow one to explore the entire @xmath53 $ ] range .",
    "in many cases of interest , eq .",
    "( [ de_2 ] ) can be solved , at least approximately . if the neutrinos propagate in a constant electron number density , @xmath38 is easily calculable , and is given by eq .",
    "( [ p_2nus ] ) , where the mass - squared difference and the mixing angle are modified to `` matter '' parameters , given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "as discussed in the previous paragraph , the matter angle and frequency depend only on @xmath48 , and , if @xmath32 , are invariant under @xmath63 .",
    "another very useful solution exists in the case of neutrinos propagating in a monotonically falling electron number density , as is the case of neutrinos produced in the sun s core @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the `` level crossing probability , '' @xmath67 is a constant matter - induced phase , and the matter angle is to be computed at the production point . if the neutrino propagation inside the sun is adiabatic , @xmath68 , while in the case of an exponential electron number density profile @xmath69 , the approximate form @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , is valid in a large portion of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "recently , a lot of progress has been made concerning the understanding of solar neutrino oscillations , including studies of whether the expressions above are valid for @xmath72 @xcite ( the dark side of the parameter space ) , and how they should be understood and interpreted @xcite .",
    "the three by three neutrino mixing matrix which connects @xmath73 , @xmath2 , and @xmath31 to the mass eigenstates @xmath74 is parametrised by three angles and one complex phase , plus two majorana phases which are not detectable via neutrino oscillation experiments and can be safely set to zero .",
    "it is `` traditional '' to define the mixing angles @xmath75 in the following way : @xmath76 while @xmath77 defines the cp - odd phase @xmath78 .    in the case of pure vacuum oscillations ,",
    "the survival probabilities are given by eq .",
    "( [ pab ] ) .",
    "it should be readily noted that , unlike the two - family case , if @xmath79 or @xmath80 , @xmath81 , signalling cp - violation in the neutrino sector . , such that @xmath82 ( cpt ) . ]",
    "if the neutrinos propagate inside a medium , the situation is ( much ) more complicated . in principle",
    ", one has to solve the schrdinger - like equation ( in the weak basis ) @xmath83\\nu_{\\beta } , ~~{\\rm where}~ v_{\\alpha\\beta}=v_{\\beta\\alpha}^*. \\label{de_3}\\ ] ] on the other hand , because the `` hamiltonian '' in eq .",
    "( [ de_3 ] ) is hermitian , the different oscillation probabilities are related .",
    "as before , the constraints @xmath84 and @xmath85 arise from the unitary evolution of the quantum state . in the case of three family oscillation",
    ", they imply that there are only four independent @xmath36 , which one may choose to be , say , the three `` diagonal '' @xmath86 plus @xmath87 .",
    "the other five are linear combinations of these four .",
    "explicitly , @xmath88 note that , unlike the two - family case , @xmath36 may differ from @xmath89 , even if the cp - odd phase @xmath78 is `` turned off '' @xcite .",
    "this means that the presence of the medium can induce not only matter cp - violation , but all matter t - violation .",
    "in order for this to happen , all that is required is that some @xmath29 breaks t - invariance .",
    "this does not happen in the presence of a constant matter density , but may certainly happen , for example , for neutrinos produced inside the sun @xcite . whether or not such effects are relevant for terrestrial neutrino beams has also been studied @xcite .    also from eq .",
    "( [ de_3 ] ) , it is possible to determine what is the `` physical range '' for the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath78 .",
    "one can directly check , as discussed in the two - family case , that if @xmath91 for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and the weak eigenstates are the same at the production and detection locations ( as are the conditions in `` normal '' matter , including no interactions beyond the sm ) , all physically distinguishable values for the oscillation probabilities are probed if the three angles are allowed to vary in the range @xmath53 $ ] , while @xmath78 covers the full range @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "note that , unlike the two - flavour case , there is no further reduction of the parameter space if the matter potential vanishes . in the presence of new physics effects that lead to a non - diagonal matter potential , a larger parameter space is , in principle , required in order to describe all possible oscillation scenarios .",
    "one final convention issue should be mentioned .",
    "thanks to the current experimental data , it has become customary to redefine the order of the mass eigenstates if @xmath95 . whenever this ( an `` inverted hierarchy '' ) happens , the mass - eigenstates are relabelled @xmath96 , such that @xmath97 and @xmath98 , always .",
    "this redefinition is done such that one can relate @xmath99 with the `` solar '' angle , @xmath100 with the `` atmospheric '' angle , and @xmath101 with the `` reactor '' angle , as will be discussed briefly in the next section .",
    "note that within this definition of the mass eigenstates ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath103 is defined such that @xmath98 ) , the sign of @xmath104 becomes `` physical , '' and determines whether the neutrino masses are hierarchical , or whether @xmath105 are quasi - degenerate ( @xmath106 ) in an inverted hierarchy .",
    "it should be noted that oscillation experiments can not distinguish whether all three mass eigenstates are quasi - degenerate or not .",
    "since we are now dealing with three - by - three matrices , simple exact solutions to eq .",
    "( [ de_3 ] ) do not exist , even in the case of a constant matter potential ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "however , nature seems to have been kind , and a few approximations seem to be well justified , including @xmath107 and @xmath108 . under these circumstances many of the well known two neutrino results can be applied .",
    "a good rule of thumb is that , in the presence of `` normal '' matter ( no new physics ) , @xmath101 is modified to a matter @xmath109 , given by eq .",
    "( [ costhm ] ) with @xmath110 and @xmath111 ; @xmath99 is also modified to a matter angle as defined in eq .",
    "( [ costhm ] ) with @xmath112 and a modified matter potential : @xmath113 ; @xmath100 and @xmath78 are not modified . for solar electron - type neutrinos",
    "( with @xmath114  mev ) , for example , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is given by eq .",
    "( [ p_solar ] ) , and @xmath117 effects are `` averaged out '' ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "here , i briefly review what the experimental data has to say about the neutrino oscillation parameters if the neutrino puzzles are interpreted as evidence for neutrino oscillations . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", i will ignore the yet unconfirmed lsnd anomaly , and concentrate on addressing only the solar and atmospheric neutrino data , while satisfying the constraints imposed by reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "first of all , reactor neutrino experiments @xcite have , so far , failed to observe a depletion of the @xmath3-flux produced by nuclear reactors .",
    "the survival probability @xmath118 and , in light of the atmospheric and solar data , @xmath119 implies @xmath120 and @xmath121  ev@xmath122 ( reactor neutrinos have energies of several mev , while the most recent experiments probed @xmath16 of order 1  km ) .",
    "second , the solar neutrino puzzle requires values of @xmath38 significantly different from 1 , such that values of @xmath123 significantly different from 1 are required ( see eq .",
    "( [ psol_3 ] ) ) .",
    "this , combined with the reactor bound , implies @xmath124 .    because the atmospheric data requires @xmath125  ev@xmath122 , @xmath104effects for solar neutrinos `` average out '' , and the solar neutrino oscillations are sensitive to mostly @xmath126 and @xmath99 ( hence these are referred to as the solar parameters ) .",
    "currently , disjoined regions of the parameter space satisfy the data quite well @xcite , and they are referred to as : the large mixing angle region , which contains @xmath127 , @xmath128 , the low - mass - squared  just - so region , which contains @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and the small mixing angle region , currently disfavoured with respect to the other two after the publication of the sno @xcite data , which contains @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "these regions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ solar_fit ] @xcite .",
    "[ solar_fit ]    finally , the atmospheric data requires @xmath133 close to 0.5 for `` large enough '' values of @xmath134 , while @xmath38 is roughly 1 .",
    "the latter is easily satisfied given the reactor constraints on @xmath126 and @xmath123 , while the former determines the values of @xmath135 and @xmath100 .",
    "explicitly ( ignoring matter effects ) , @xmath136 note that `` maximal mixing '' corresponds to @xmath137 .",
    "detailed analyses of the atmospheric data in terms of neutrino oscillations constrain @xmath138 and @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "the lsnd anomaly may be interpreted as evidence for @xmath140 conversion .",
    "if the conversion mechanism is neutrino oscillations , the lsnd result requires @xmath141 for neutrino energies of several tens of mev and a baseline of roughly 30 metres @xcite . in order to obtain a small enough oscillation length , values of @xmath142",
    "ev@xmath122 , much larger than the values required in order to address the solar and atmospheric puzzles , are required . if all three neutrino puzzles are interpreted in terms of neutrino oscillations , three different @xmath143 values are required , which implies the existence of ( at least ) four neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "one the other hand , very precise lep measurements at the @xmath144-boson pole indicate that there are only three neutrino species that couple to the @xmath144-boson .",
    "one is forced to conclude , therefore , that the lsnd anomaly , combined with the solar and atmospheric puzzles , hints at the existence of a fourth neutrino , which is a sm singlet ( hence referred to as `` sterile , '' @xmath145 ) .",
    "there are two rather distinct ways of organising the four neutrino masses - squared in order to try to solve all the neutrino anomalies .",
    "one is the `` 3 + 1 '' scheme , which has four hierarchical masses - squared , @xmath146 , such that @xmath126 is responsible for the solar anomaly , @xmath147 for the atmospheric anomaly , and @xmath148 for the lsnd anomaly ( there are other variations , such as an `` inverted hierarchy '' for the masses of @xmath74 ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the @xmath149 state turns out to be predominantly @xmath145 , and the solar and atmospheric puzzles are interpreted in terms of ( predominantly ) active neutrino oscillations .",
    "the lsnd anomaly , on the other hand , requires a small @xmath150 component in @xmath149 .",
    "a reasonable combined fit to all three puzzles exists , and is quite robust .",
    "the biggest obstacle to the 3 + 1 schemes is to satisfy bounds from terrestrial @xmath2 and @xmath1 oscillation experiments , which are sensitive to the large value of @xmath143 required to solve the lsnd anomaly . for more details , see the talk by orlando peres @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to `` pair up '' the neutrino masses , such that @xmath151 . in this case",
    ", @xmath126 is responsible for the solar anomaly , @xmath152 for the atmospheric anomaly , and @xmath153 for the lsnd anomaly ( one variation is @xmath126 responsible for the atmospheric anomaly and @xmath152 for the solar one ) .",
    "these are referred to as `` 2 + 2 '' schemes . in this case , there are virtually no constraints from terrestrial neutrino oscillation searches but , instead , one has to worry about properly solving the solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles .",
    "the problem is easy to understand .",
    "it has to do with the fact that , in a 2 + 2 scheme , either solar @xmath1 or atmospheric @xmath2 oscillations have to be into a predominantly sterile state .",
    "explicitely , let us assume @xmath154 , and @xmath155 ( note that these conditions are weakly violated if one is to solve the lsnd anomaly ) , such that @xmath156 in this case , @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) would play the part of the solar ( atmospheric ) angle , while @xmath159 controls the `` amount '' of sterile neutrino in both the solar and the atmospheric sectors .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath160 , @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) oscillates into a pure @xmath145 ( @xmath31 ) state , while the situation is reversed if @xmath161 .",
    "the current atmospheric data strongly disfavours ( at more than 99% confidence level @xcite ) @xmath160 , while the solar data disfavours @xmath161 @xcite ( this can also be seen in fig .  [ solar_fit ] ) .",
    "detailed quantitative analysis @xcite seem to indicate that , if all atmospheric and solar data are combined , acceptable fits can be found ( the current best fit point is close to @xmath162 @xcite ) .",
    "it is curious to note that , according to @xcite , the point where the sterile component is evenly shared among the solar and atmospheric pairs ( @xmath163 ) is strongly disfavoured by the data .",
    "as more neutrino data accumulates , it is not impossible to imagine that 2 + 2 schemes will be severly cosntrained by the data ( perhaps as much , or more , than the 3 + 1 schemes ) .",
    "it is easy to summarise the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : at_work ] : @xmath135 and @xmath100 have been rather well measured , while @xmath126 and @xmath99 have also been measured , but rather poorly .",
    "nothing is known about the value of @xmath101 ( except that it is relatively small ) , the value of the cp - odd phase @xmath78 , or the neutrino mass - hierarchy ( the sign of @xmath104 in the traditional parametrisation ) .    in the near future",
    ", the situation is bound to improve significantly , especially in the solar sector .",
    "the on - going solar experiments ( in particular sno ) will not only establish once and for all that neutrino conversion is the mechanism behind the solar neutrino problem , but will also improve our knowledge of the solar parameters .",
    "the near future experiments kamland @xcite and borexino @xcite have the ability to go even further , by not only breaking the current degeneracy in the @xmath164-plane but also determining the solar parameters with unprecedented precision ( kamland in the case of the large mixing angle solution @xcite , borexino in the case of the low - mass - squared  just - so solution @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it should also be noted that the kamland reactor experiment offers the first realistic opportunity to observe a `` real '' oscillatory pattern , while the borexino solar neutrino experiment may establish , similar to what sno will eventually accomplish , whether there are neutrinos other than @xmath1 coming from the sun @xcite .    in the `` atmospheric sector , '' the ongoing k2k experiment @xcite , the future minos experiment @xcite , and the cern cngs project @xcite will confirm atmospheric neutrino oscillations , discover @xmath165-appearance , and extend slightly the sensitivity to @xmath101 , on top of precisely measuring the atmospheric parameters @xmath135 and @xmath100 .    finally , after the miniboone data @xcite is collected and analysed , the issue of whether the lsnd anomaly is indeed a consequence of new neutrino physics will be settled .",
    "we will then be able to decide whether there is indeed a light sterile neutrino , such that all three neutrino anomalies are explained by neutrino oscillations .",
    "it should be noted , as briefly discussed in the sec .",
    "[ sec : lsnd ] , that the current neutrino data already places a significant amount of `` pressure '' on sterile neutrino oscillations , and the situation is bound to change as new experimental data from solar , reactor and long - baseline experiments becomes available ( for an example , see @xcite ) .    in five to ten years times , the neutrino mixing matrix will still be far from well known : most likely , one of the mixing angles will simply not have been observed ( unless the long - baseline experiments `` get lucky '' ) , and whether or not there is a nontrivial cp - odd phase will remain unknown .",
    "furthermore , we will be unable to say whether the neutrinos masses are hierarchical ( @xmath166 ) , or whether the hierarchy is inverted ( @xmath167 , such that @xmath168 ) .",
    "these challenges have to be tackled by a new generation of neutrino experiments , which requires cleaner and much more intense neutrino beams , of different flavours ( if possible , as is the case of a neutrino factory ) .",
    "i conclude by mentioning that there are other ways of probing the neutrino mixing matrix and mass spectrum . in particular , the future observation of neutrinos from a nearby supernova will probably shed light on some of the issues raised above @xcite , while continuing searches for neutrinoless double beta decay ( which are the best probes of whether the neutrinos are majorana or dirac fermions ) and a `` kinematic '' neutrino mass in the tritium beta - decay spectrum also add valuable information @xcite",

    "<S> i discuss in some detail the physical neutrino oscillations parameter space in the case of two and three family mixing , and briefly describe the current knowledge of neutrino mixing parameters according to the present solar , atmospheric , and reactor neutrino data . </S>",
    "<S> i also briefly comment on the possibility of solving the lnsd anomaly together with the solar and atmospheric ones . </S>",
    "<S> i conclude by emphasising that that even though in five to ten years time a lot will be learnt from the next round of neutrino experiments , a great deal about neutrino masses and neutrino mixing will remain unknown .    </S>",
