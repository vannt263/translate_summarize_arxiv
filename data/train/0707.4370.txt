    "rotation curves ( hereafter rc ) of disk galaxies do not show any keplerian fall - off and do not match the distribution of the stellar ( plus gaseous ) matter . as a most natural explanation",
    ", this implies an additional invisible mass component ( rubin et al .",
    "1980 ; bosma 1981 , persic & salucci , 1988 ) that becomes progressively more conspicuous at outer radii and for the less luminous galaxies ( e.g. : persic & salucci , 1988 ; broeils , 1992 ) .",
    "the distribution of matter in disk systems has become a crucial benchmark for the present understanding of the process of galaxy formation .",
    "time is ripe that we can address , with the help of the available observational scenario , crucial questions : i ) has the dm an universal distribution reflecting its very nature ?",
    "ii ) how and why the dark - to - luminous mass ratio and other dark and luminous physical quantities vary in objects of different mass ?",
    "0.2 cm    -0.2 cm    it is well known that numerical simulations performed in the framework of the currently favored theory of structure formation , @xmath0 cold dark matter , predict a well - defined density profile for the virialized halos ( navarro , frenk and white , 1996 ) . furthermore , the mechanism of galaxy formation , as currently understood , involves the cooling and the condensation of pristine hi gas inside the gravitational potential well of dm halos , the transformation of part of this gas into stars and finally the feedback of the latter on the former , through sn explosions .",
    "it is widely accepted that the mass distribution of spiral galaxies , we can derive from observations , bears the imprint of the nature and the cosmological history of the dm , its interaction with the lm and it highlights the astrophysical processes that have turned ( some of ) the pristine infalling gas into a stellar disk .",
    "it is worth to define the dark matter in the following way : let us set @xmath1 the mass distribution of the gravitating matter and @xmath2 that of the baryonic `` luminous '' matter , both obtained from observations . realized that these distributions do not match ,",
    "i.e. @xmath3 , we introduce a dark mass component with mass profile @xmath4 such that :    @xmath5    with this definition it is immediate that the study of the dm phenomenon involves the _ slope _ of the rc rather than its amplitude and must start from a proper knowledge of the luminous matter distribution . in spirals , this has three components : a stellar bulge , a thin stellar disk and an extended thin hi disk . within the aim of this paper",
    "the latter component plays little role and it will be neglected unless we consider individual hi - rich objects .",
    "the first component , instead , it is important in early type spirals , not considered here and then we redirect the reader to noordermeer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the luminous matter in spirals is distributed in thin disk with surface luminosity ( freeman , 1970 ) : @xmath6 with @xmath7 the disk scale - length ; @xmath8 the central value ; it is useful to define @xmath9 as the `` size '' of the stellar disk , whose luminosity is @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the coadded ( i - band ) light profiles of 616 late types spirals arranged in 11 luminosity bins as a function of radius , expressed in units of optical radius . we realize that the light profile does not depend on galaxy luminosity and it is well represented by a freeman profile .    although the mass modelling of some individual object may require to consider non - exponential stellar disks , eq ( 1.2 ) well represents the typical distribution of stars in late type spirals .",
    "similarly , the moderate radial variations of the stellar mass - to - light ratios in spirals will be neglected as they are irrelevant for the present issues ( portinari & salucci , 2007 ) .",
    "-0.7 cm    -0.7 cm    finally we assume flat cosmology with matter density parameter @xmath11 and hubble constant @xmath12 , at the present time , the size @xmath13 and the mass @xmath14 of a virialized halo are related by :    @xmath15",
    "in self - gravitating systems in full centrifugal equilibrium , the circular velocity @xmath16 at a radius @xmath17 is linked to the gravitational field @xmath18 by @xmath19 . in spirals , we measure the rotation velocity @xmath20 , i.e. the projection on the line of sight of the tangential velocity in cylindric coodinates .",
    "let us notice that : @xmath21 , where the latter defines non - axysimmetric motions unrelated to the central potential .",
    "@xmath20 measures the gravitational field only when the latter motions are negligible .",
    "the discovery , at radii @xmath22 , of the radial tully - fisher relation ( yegorova & salucci , 2007 ) , i.e. of an ensemble of tf - like , statistically independent , low scatter relationships between the galaxy absolute magnitude and its _ rotation _ velocity ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the slope and zero - point of the relations , indicates that the rc s are good gravitational field tracer .",
    "more specifically , the fact that in any object and at any radius , the rotation velocity can be predicted just by the galaxy luminosity implies that @xmath27 is generally negligible . a similar conclusion is reached when we reproduce the innermost regions of spirals rc s with mass models with the luminous matter alone , that leaves no space both for dm and for significant non circular motions ( ratnam et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the kinematical properties of sb - im spirals led to the _ universal rotation curve ( urc ) paradigm _ , pioneered in persic and salucci ( 1991 ) and set in persic , salucci & stel ( 1996 , hereafter pss ) .",
    "we can state that ( see also salucci et al , 2007 ) the rcs can be generally represented out to their virial radius by @xmath28 , i.e. by a _",
    "universal _ function of radius , tuned by some galaxy property @xmath29 , such as the luminosity or the virial mass that serves as galaxy identifier .",
    "the radius can be measured in three coordinate systems @xmath30 : the physical coordinate , and coordinates focused on the luminous and the dark matter distributions respectively .    -0.4truecm    -0.2truecm",
    "-0.1 cm    the data used to build the urc are 1 ) 616 rcs that are first arranged in 11 luminosity intervals spanning the whole @xmath31-band luminosity range @xmath32 , with each luminosity bin having @xmath33 velocity measurements , and then coadded by arranging the latter in radial bins of size @xmath34 .",
    "this builds 11 synthetic curves @xmath35 out to @xmath36 ( see pss ) , free from most of the observational errors and non - axisymmetric disturbances present in individual rcs .",
    "these rc s result very smooth and with a very small intrinsic variance , but showing a very strong luminosity dependence ( see also catinella et al , 2006 ) b ) the empirical relationship between rc slope at 2 @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see pss ) c ) the halo virial velocity @xmath39 , obtained from the disk mass vs. virial mass relationship ( see shankar et al . ,",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the _ urc paradigm _ , i.e. the idea according to which halo mass ( or the disk mass ) , eventually involving few other quantities , `` determines '' at any radii the circular velocity of any spiral within an error that is typically much smaller than the true variations that the rc shows in galaxies and among galaxies is implemented by the urc _ function _ , an analytical curve we construct as the sum in quadrature of the disk and halo contributions to the circular velocity , meant to be the observational counterpart of the nfw velocity profile .",
    "then , we set : @xmath40 . from ( 1.2 ) the disk term is :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the modified bessel functions computed at @xmath45 .    -.8truecm    -0.4truecm",
    "-0.2 cm    for the dm term we assume that the dark halo follows a salucci & burkert ( 2000 ) profile , a cored distribution that can converges to a nfw one at outer radii @xmath46    @xmath47 is the core radius and @xmath48 the central density density .",
    "then : @xmath49 \\big\\}~.\\ ] ]    then , the urc function , has three free parameters @xmath48 , @xmath47 , @xmath50 that are obtained from fitting @xmath51 and the other data specified above .",
    "-0.2 cm    -0.1 cm    in fig .",
    "3 we show @xmath52 , the urc with the radius expressed in physical units and the objects identified by the halo virial mass ; each line refers to a given halo mass in the range @xmath53 ; the halo mass determines both the amplitude and the shape of the curve .",
    "note the contribution of the baryonic component , negligible for small masses but increasingly important in the larger structures . in fig .",
    "4 we frame the urc from a full dm perspective by plotting @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the radial `` dark '' coordinate , and the urc is normalized by @xmath56 .",
    "the urc shows that the dm halos and stellar disks are both self - similar , but the whole system is not , likely due to the baryons collapse that has have broken it in the innermost @xmath57 of the halo size .",
    "let us notice that the rc s of spirals are _ critically _ not flat : their rc slopes take all of sort of values from that of a solid - body system ( i.e. + 1 ) to that of an almost newtonian point - mass ( i.e. - 1/2 ) .",
    "the maximum of the rc occurs at very different radii , for galaxies of different mass , viz . at @xmath58 for the most massive objects and at @xmath59 for the least massive ones .",
    "the existence of systematical properties of the mass distribution in spirals was first claimed by persic and salucci ( 1988 ) and then successively confirmed by independent works ( broeils , 1992 ; pss ; rhee , 1997 ; swaters , 1999 ) .",
    "however , until now it has been considered by current theory of galaxy formation only in a limited way .",
    "likely , this is a consequence of the theoretical prejudice that the cosmological galaxy formation process did not leave relevant features in the distribution of matter in galaxies and of the difficulties that simulations have in `` reproducing '' reasonable disk systems .",
    "however , after salucci et al ( 2007 ) , we believe that , in order to understand the whole process of their formation we must take into account the rich scenario of the dark - luminous interplay occurred in galaxies .    -0.2 cm",
    "-0.5truecm    -0.1truecm    the mass distribution in spirals is obtained by mass modelling two very different and complementary kinematical set of data _ a ) _ a large number of _ individual _ rc s of objects of different luminosity and _ b ) _ the urc ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , that , let us remind , originates from _ coadded _ rc s ; noticeably , the results obtained from these two different sets of data are very similar , indicating so that they are robust and reliable . a clear scenario of the mass distribution emerges , see fig . 6 :",
    "@xmath60 the stellar disk dominates the galaxy s inner region out to the radius @xmath61 at which the dm halo contribution starts to take over the stellar one .",
    "this sets the properties of the radial tully fisher relation and yields to the paradigm of the inner baryon dominance : the inner portions of the ( observed ) rc that can be accounted by the stellar matter alone are indeed saturated by this component .",
    "@xmath60 at any radii , smaller lower luminosity objects have more progressively more proportion of dark matter i.e. a larger dark - to - stellar mass ratio . in detail , the disk mass is @xmath62 at small virial masses , @xmath63 and @xmath64 at larger masses , @xmath65 .",
    "the baryonic fraction is always much smaller than @xmath66 , i.e. the cosmological value and it ranges between @xmath67 to @xmath68 in line with is the wellknown evidence that sn explosions have removed ( or made never condense ) a very large fraction of the original hi material .",
    "@xmath60 smaller spirals are denser , with the central density spanning 2 order of magnitudes over the mass sequence of spirals .",
    "if this reflects the background density at the formation time , it indicates that the present day population of spirals has been hierarchically formed from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , and , since then , it has experienced very little merging .",
    "@xmath60 the structural parameters of the mass distribution , @xmath48 , @xmath50 , @xmath71 , @xmath47 are remarkably all related , see figure ( 4 ) and fig ( 11 ) of pss .",
    "notice that , although this evidence is connected with the urc paradigm , however it is not directly implied by it nor it implies it .",
    "@xmath60 the stellar mass - to - light ratio is found to lie between 0.5 and 4 .",
    "the values of disk masses derived as above agree very well with those obtained by fitting their sed with spectro - photometric models ( salucci , yegorova , drory , 2007 )    @xmath60 the hi component is almost always below the kinematical detectably .",
    "however , in low mass systems it can not be neglected in the baryonic budget since it is more prominent than the stellar disk .",
    "a fundamental prediction of the cosmological ( @xmath0 ) cold dark matter simulations is that virialized dark matter halos have an universal spherically averaged density profile @xmath72 ( navarro , frenk & white , 1997 )    @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are strongly correlated ( e.g. wechsler et al , .",
    "2002 ) , we have : @xmath76 , that sets the region of the inner cusp .",
    "the above profile converges , at small radii , to a power - law of index -1 , although , according to higher resolution simulations , the actual value of the index reaches about -1.35 ( e.g. moore et al 1999 , navarro et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the cdm predictions can be confronted with observations : rc s of disk galaxies , in fact , probe the crucial region @xmath77 .",
    "flores & primack ( 1994 ) , moore ( 1994 ) claimed , for some dwarfs , a tension between the kinematical data and the predictions of simulations : dm halos seemed to prefer cored density distributions rather than cuspy ones ( see also van den bosch and swaters , 2001 ; weldrake et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "0.2 cm    0.2 cm    the importance of the issue , that concerns the very nature of dark matter , and the fact that these early results were questioned on several aspects , has triggered new investigations characterized by the study of few proper test - cases but with higher quality kinematical data and by means of a properly devised analysis ( gentile et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "these improvements were necessary : to obtain reliable dm profiles requires extended , regular , homogeneous rc s reliable up to their second derivative and free from deviations from the axial symmetry .",
    "then , up to now , few tenths of objects have qualified to undergo such critics - free investigation ( e.g. the list in donato et al . , 2004 ; simon et al .",
    "; 2005 , gentile et al .",
    ", 2005 ; 2007 ; de blok , 2007 ) .    in all these cases data and simulations were found in plain disagreement on _ three _ different aspects : the best - fit disk + nfw halo mass model a ) fits the rc poorly and it implies b ) an implausibly low stellar mass - to - light ratio and c ) an unphysical high halo mass .",
    "0.1 cm    0.1 cm    as an example , it is worth to discuss in detail the case of the nearby dwarf galaxy ddo  47 ( gentile et al 2005 ) .",
    "the hi observations have adequate resolution and sensitivity , showing that the hi 2-d kinematics is very regular , with a well - behaved velocity field .",
    "the observed velocity along the line of sight @xmath78 has been decomposed in terms of harmonic coefficients : @xmath79 $ ] where @xmath80 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath81 is the systemic velocity , @xmath82 is the rotation velocity ( see schoenmakers et al . , 1997 ) ; it is found that the coefficients @xmath83 , @xmath84 @xmath85 have a small amplitude ( see fig .",
    "7 ) that excludes significant global elongation and lopsidedness of the potential and detects non - circular motions with amplitude and radial profile very different from that necessary to hide a cuspy density distribution in the observed rotation curve .",
    "the rc mass modelling , shown in fig .",
    "( 8) , finds that the ddo 47 dark halo has a core radius of about 7 kpc and a central density @xmath86 g @xmath87 , i.e. a _ much _ shallower distribution than that predicted by the nfw profile .    in all cases studied up to date",
    "a serious data - prediction discrepancy emerges , that becomes definitive when we remind that the actual @xmath88 halo profiles are steeper than the standard nfw ones considered here and that the baryonic adiabatic collapse has likely contracted them further . on the other hand , this discrepancy found in a relatively small number of objects can not be extended to the _ whole _ population of spirals , which is still not sufficiently investigated .",
    "let us stress that there is not shortage of proposals to explain the `` density core phenomenon '' within the @xmath0cdm scenario itself ( e.g tonini et al 2007 ) .",
    "the distribution of luminous and dark matter in galaxies shows amazing properties and a remarkable systematics that make it as one of the hottest cosmological issues .",
    "there is no doubt that this emerging observational scenario will be decisive in guiding how the @xmath88-based theory of galaxy formation must evolve to meet the challenge that the observational data are posing .",
