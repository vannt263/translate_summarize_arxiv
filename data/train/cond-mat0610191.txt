    "we have performed explicit calculations for parameters relevant to experiments on thallium cuprate @xcite and shown that these do not on their own imply the coherence of interlayer transport .",
    "these fits are very sensitive to the anisotropies of intralayer properties .    whilst we have focused our attention on the example of amro in thallium cuprate , our results have a much wider applicability",
    " in fact to any layered metal with an anisotropic fermi surface and anisotropic scattering .",
    "our results have been stated for quasi - two - dimensional systems , but it should be fairly straightforward to generalize our results to quasi - one - dimensional systems such as bechgaard salts , for which there is a substantial amount of amro data.@xcite we also discuss how amro can be used in conjunction with other techniques such as arpes to place strong constraints on fs properties .",
    "combined amro and arpes studies of layered metals could give a strong consistency check for the results of both techniques and this suggests many future opportunities ahead for amro as a powerful probe of anisotropies in layered metals .",
    "in particular , for superconducting organic charge transfer salts a characterization of intralayer anisotropies , could reveal the presence of a pseudogap with d - wave symmetry , as predicted by a resonating valence bond theory of these materials.@xcite    we thank n. e. hussey and m. abdel - jawad for stimulating discussions and for showing us unpublished experimental results .",
