    "many procedures in science , engineering , and medicine produce data in the form of shapes of point clouds in @xmath0 .",
    "if one expects such a cloud to follow roughly a submanifold of a certain type in @xmath0 , then it is of utmost importance to describe the space of all possible submanifolds of this type ( we call it a shape space hereafter ) and equip it with a significant metric which is able to distinguish special features of the shapes .",
    "most of the metrics used today in data analysis and computer vision are of an ad - hoc and naive nature ; one embeds shape space in some hilbert space or banach space and uses the distance therein .",
    "shortest paths are then line segments , but they leave shape space quickly .",
    "riemannian metrics on shape space itself are a better solution .",
    "they lead to geodesics , to curvature and diffusion .",
    "eventually one also needs statistics on shape space like means of clustered subsets of data ( called karcher means on riemannian manifolds ) and standard deviations .",
    "here curvature will play an essential role ; statistics on riemannian manifolds seems hopelessly underdeveloped just now .",
    "thus , initially , by a shape we mean a smoothly embedded hypersurface in @xmath0 which is diffeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "the space of these shapes will be denoted @xmath17 and viewed as the quotient ( see @xcite for more details in a more general situation ) @xmath18 of the open subset @xmath19 of smooth embeddings of @xmath1 in @xmath0 , modulo the group of smooth diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 .",
    "it is natural to consider all possible _ immersions _ as well as embeddings , and thus introduce the larger space @xmath20 as the quotient of the space of @xmath21 immersions by the group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 ( which is , however , no longer a manifold , but an orbifold with finite isotropy groups , see @xcite ) : @xmath22 \\ar@{->>}[r ] &   \\on{emb}(m,\\mathbb r^n)/\\on{diff}(m ) \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] \\ar@{=}[r ]   &    b_e(m,\\mathbb r^n ) \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] \\\\",

    "have investigated a variety of riemannian metrics on the shape space @xmath23 of immersion of the circle into the plane modulo the group of reparameterizations of the circle @xmath24 . in @xcite they found that the simplest such metric has vanishing geodesic distance ; this is the metric induced by @xmath25 on @xmath26 : @xmath27 in @xcite they found that the vanishing geodesic distance phenomenon for the @xmath28-metric occurs also in the more general shape space @xmath29 where @xmath24 is replaced by a compact manifold @xmath1 and euclidean @xmath30 is replaced by a riemannian manifold @xmath31 ; it also occurs on the full diffeomorphism group @xmath32 , but not on the subgroup @xmath33 of volume preserving diffeomorphisms , where the geodesic equation for the @xmath28-metric is the euler equation of an incompressible fluid . in @xcite a class of metrics",
    "was investigated which were called almost local metrics : they were of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a suitable smooth function , @xmath36 is the lenght of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the curvature of @xmath37 . if @xmath39 then this is just a conformal change of the metric ; it was proposed and investigated independently in @xcite and in @xcite . for @xmath40",
    "the metric was investigated in great detail in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we take up the investigation of almost local metrics from @xcite and we generalize it to the shape space @xmath41 of hypersurfaces of type @xmath1 in @xmath0 ; here @xmath1 is a compact orientable connected manifold of dimension @xmath2 , for example the hypersphere @xmath42 .",
    "a riemannian metric on @xmath43 is just a family of positive definite inner products @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent vector fields on @xmath0 along @xmath9 .",
    "we require that our metrics will be invariant under the action of @xmath47 , hence the quotient map dividing by this action will be a riemannian submersion .",
    "this means that the tangent map of the quotient map @xmath48 is a metric quotient mapping between all tangent spaces .",
    "thus we will get riemannian metrics on @xmath49 . here",
    "the restriction to almost local @xmath47-invariant metrics is very beneficial : for any @xmath50 those vectors in @xmath51 which are @xmath52-perpendicuar to the @xmath47-orbit through @xmath9 are exactly those vector fields which are pointwise normal to @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "we shall call such vectors _ horizontal_. the tangent map of the quotient map @xmath48 is then an isometry when restricted to the horizontal spaces , just as in the finite dimensional situation .",
    "riemannian submersions have a very nice effect on geodesics : the geodesics on the quotient space @xmath49 are exactly the images of the horizontal geodesics on the top space @xmath54 .",
    "( by a horizontal geodesic we mean a geodesic whose tangent lies in the horizontal bundle . )",
    "the simplest inner product on the tangent bundle to @xmath43 is @xmath55 where @xmath6 is the euclidean inner product on @xmath0 .",
    "since the volume form @xmath56 reacts equivariantly to the action of the group @xmath47 , this metric is invariant , and the map to the quotient @xmath49 is a riemannian submersion for this metric .",
    "all of the metrics we will look at will be of the form : @xmath57 where @xmath35 is a suitable positive smooth function , @xmath11 is the total hypersurface volume of @xmath12 , and where the trace @xmath13 of the weingarten mapping is the the mean curvature .",
    "as mentioned above , these metrics will be called almost local .",
    "let us now describe in some detail the contents of this paper and the metrics .",
    "section [ no ] recalls concepts from differential geometry of hypersurfaces in a form that is suitable for our needs .    in section [ variation ]",
    "we calculate the derivatives of the metric , the volume form , the second fundamental form and some other curvature terms with respect to the immersion @xmath9 , and the second derivatives for both tangent vectors horizontal .",
    "the differential calculus used is convenient calculus as in @xcite .",
    "some of the formulas can be found in @xcite , and in @xcite .",
    "section [ hamiltonian ] describes the general hamiltonian formalism that we shall use to compute geodesic equations and conserved quantities in a quick way .",
    "this is a shortened version of @xcite , updated to the more general situation here .",
    "see also @xcite for a detailed exposition in similar notation .",
    "first we consider general riemannian metrics on the space of immersions which admit christoffel symbols .",
    "we express this as the existence of two kinds of gradients .",
    "since the energy function is not even defined on the whole cotangent bundle of the tangent bundle we pull back to the tangent bundle the canonical symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle .",
    "then we determine the hamiltonian vector field mapping and , as a special case , the geodesic equation .",
    "we determine the equivariant moment mapping for several group actions on the space of immersions : the action of the reparametrization group @xmath47 , of the motion group of @xmath0 , and also of the scaling group ( if the metric is scale invariant ) .    in section [ geodesic_equation_imm : geodesic_equation ]",
    "we compute the geodesic equation on @xmath43 for the general almost local metric , and its conserved momenta .",
    "in section [ geodesic_equation_bi : geodesic_equation ] we split this geodesic equation into its horizontal part ( which is the geodesic equation on shape space @xmath16 ) and in its vertical part which vanishes identical .",
    "section [ sectional_curvature ] computes the sectional curvature of @xmath16 for the general almost local metric .",
    "the result is the sum of terms  and @xmath58 over the terms for @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "some of these terms make positive contribution to sectional curvature , some negative , and others are indefinite .    in section [ geodesic_distance ] some estimates for geodesic distance on @xmath16",
    "are given : two area swept out bounds , and lipschitz continuity of @xmath61 .",
    "in addition we compare the almost local metrics to the frchet metric .",
    "in section [ con_spheres ] we study the totally geodesic subspace of concentric spheres .",
    "in section [ special_metrics ] we specialize the general results to special choices for the weight function @xmath14 .",
    "these are the following :    * the @xmath62-metric or @xmath28-metric , where @xmath63 , geodesic distance on @xmath49 vanishes ( as shown in @xcite ) , and which has simple non - negative sectional curvature . *",
    "the @xmath64-metric where @xmath65 ; its geodesic equation was treated in @xcite for the situation of plane curves , with its sectional curvature .",
    "here we have the geodesic equation and the sectional curvature as special cases .",
    "* conformal metrics where @xmath66 . for curves",
    "these were investigated in @xcite . the full formula for sectional curvature",
    "is given only in the case that @xmath67 .",
    "* the scale invariant version where @xmath68 .",
    "section [ numerics ] contains numerical experiments for geodesics .",
    "we only do boundary value problems and no initial value problems ( it is not clear that the equations are well posed ) .",
    "we use mathematica to set up the triangulation of the surfaces , feed this into ampl ( a modelling software developed for optimization ) and use the solver ipopt .",
    "the numerical results are tested on the totally geodesic subspace of concentric spheres where we also have the analytic solutions .",
    "then we study the translations of spheres for various metrics and discuss the appearing phenomena .",
    "finally we deform some surfaces .",
    "this paper benefited from discussions with david mumford , with hermann schichl who taught us about the use of ampl , with johannes wallner and tilak ratnanather .",
    "big parts of this paper can be found in the doctoral dissertation of martin bauer , @xcite .",
    "in this section we will present and develop the differential geometric tools that are needed to deal with immersed surfaces .",
    "the most important point is a rigorous treatment of the covariant derivative and related concepts .    in @xcite one",
    "can find some parts of this section in a more general setting .",
    "we use the notation of @xcite . some of the definitions can also be found in @xcite .",
    "a similar exposition in the same notation is @xcite .",
    "we always assume that @xmath1 is a connected and compact manifold of dimension @xmath2 without boundary . we will work with _ immersions _ of @xmath1 into @xmath69 , i.e. smooth functions @xmath70 with injective tangent mapping at every point .",
