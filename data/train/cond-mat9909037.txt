    "in order to understand the fundamental mechanism for high-@xmath0 superconductors ( htsc ) , many experiments have attempted to find out the properties of the superconductors pair wave function . notwithstanding this effort",
    "the nature of the orbital order parameter symmetry ( or energy gap ) has not yet been settled , despite increasing evidences toward a major @xmath1 symmetry as it explains a number of different experimental results@xcite .",
    "furthermore the d - wave state has also theoretical support from weak and strong - coupling approaches@xcite and from monte carlo and numerical studies on a two dimensional hubbard model@xcite . on the other hand several experiments",
    "have also suggested the presence of real or complex mixture of order parameters .",
    "for instance , c - axis josephson tunneling data between twinned ybco and a s - wave superconductor were interpreted by a condensate containing a mixture of @xmath1 and @xmath7 order parameter@xcite .",
    "this type of order parameter symmetry was argued to be a consequence of the orthorhombicity of the ybco crystal structure@xcite .",
    "recently , klemm at al@xcite have studied the symmetry operation of the crystal groups relevant to hg1001 , ybco and bscco to analyze the possibility of different order parameter symmetry combinations for these htsc and their results agree with the c - axis josephson tunneling experiments .",
    "furthermore the possibility of complex mixtures of different symmetries has also been suggested@xcite as it would induce time reversal symmetry breaking in connection with magnetic defects or small fractions of a flux quantum @xmath8 observed in ybco powders .",
    "similarly a complex admixture of @xmath1 and @xmath7 symmetry was also proposed@xcite to explain the ab - oriented ybco / i / cu tunnel junctions data@xcite .",
    "they proposed an interesting and very simple physical picture : andreev scattering near the ybco surface causes strong pair dissociation .",
    "the resulting quasiparticles may then be paired again also by a subdominant @xmath7-channel that is less sensitive to surface pair breaking then the dominant @xmath1-channel .",
    "calculations minimizing the free energy show@xcite that such complex mixture can coexist at low temperatures . using a tight binding model in a mean field treatment honerkamp et al@xcite have arrived at a similar conclusion that a surface phase transition towards a time - reversal symmetry breaking surface state carrying an @xmath9i@xmath1 state may appear ( below @xmath0 ) .",
    "recently@xcite a complex mixture of @xmath10 was also proposed in order to explain a phase transition characterized by magnetic field plateaus or kinks in the thermal conductivity@xcite of @xmath11 compounds .    based on the above discussion",
    ", we study in this paper the competition of the @xmath1 and others subdominants complex symmetries of the gap function .",
    "we develop in these calculations a novel approach based on a change in the position of the attractive potential @xmath12 from its usual nearest neighbor position in the extended hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "as it is well known , the on - site coulomb correlations may explain the antiferromagnetism of the low doping regime , the large magnetic fluctuations and the semiconductor like properties of the metallic phase@xcite .",
    "furthermore the presence of a small attractive interaction leads to phase separation and , on a square lattice , yields a superconducting phase with a @xmath1 symmetry@xcite .",
    "thus , the hubbard hamiltonian with such phenomenological attraction is a natural candidate to deal with the htsc .",
    "the idea to change the position of the attractive potential in the extended hubbard hamiltonian was originally motivated by the experimental fact that different compounds have different @xmath13 phase diagram and the optimal doping values may vary according the compound .",
    "this fact can be physically interpreted due to a possible change in the range of the attractive interaction that leads to pair formation @xcite ; for compounds with short range correlations the carrier density must be larger than those compounds with a longer ranged interaction in order to undergo a superconducting phase transition .",
    "the same type of physical argument can be used to interpret the measured different values of the coherence length @xmath14 for different family of compounds since a short range interaction requires larger densities than a long range one in order to produce the coherence motion that leads to superconductivity .",
    "furthermore , the typical parameter which characterizes the strength of the attractive interaction@xcite , @xmath15 , when estimated for most of htsc , varies between 10 - 3000 and such high values indicate that the size of the bound states ( or cooper pairs ) are indeed related to the size of the minimum of the attractive potential .",
    "another interesting aspect from the theoretical point of view is that this parametric change of the attractive potential can be related with the order parameter expansion introduced by the spin - fluctuation theory@xcite . in this approach",
    "it has been proposed a @xmath1-wave gap of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is expanded in powers of @xmath18 . taking a close look at this expansion",
    ", one can easily verify that it contains terms like @xmath19 which are proportional to @xmath20 and what can be seen as a type of d - wave gap symmetry that arises from a potential like @xmath21 . by the same token",
    ", we can find terms proportional to @xmath22 which can be originated by a potential @xmath23 and so on .",
    "there will also be crossed terms proportional to @xmath24 that may be associated to a next - nearest potential .",
    "thus , we see that the gap expression proposed by the spin - fluctuation theory contains several terms and some may be associated to a potential of the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a parameter related to the position of the attractive potential ( @xmath27 leads to the usual nearest - neighbor expression ) .",
    "consequently we have studied in this paper the phase diagram of complex admixtures of a d - wave like order parameter with some minor complex component with this parameterized change of the potential position , that is , with different values of @xmath5 .",
    "these calculations are made with the extended hubbard model on a square lattice of side @xmath28 , which describes a tight binding model with the strong correlations taken into account and is defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hopping integral between sites @xmath31 and @xmath32 and are estimated by comparison with either band structure calculations or fermi surface measurements , u is the on - site correlated repulsion and v is an attractive phenomenological interaction which in principle can be due to spin fluctuations , as mentioned above or any other type of mechanism . in order to obtain quantitative results ,",
    "we have used the tight - binding dispersion relation derived from fermi surface measurements by norman et al@xcite for @xmath11 but this choice is not a fundamental requirement , another studies have used different dispersion@xcite with small quantitative changes .",
    "we used a bsc mean - field approximation@xcite to study the superconducting phase associated with the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) described above . in this model the superconducting state is characterized by a gap order parameter , which at a finite temperature t satisfies the bcs self - consistent equation    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the fourier transform of the potential of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) and    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the dispersion relation taken from ref.@xcite and @xmath37 is the chemical potential .",
    "following along the lines of ref.@xcite , one can easily show that @xmath34 may be written in a `` separable '' form , @xmath38 which leads to the usual d and s - wave .",
    "this procedure can easily be generalized for the case of @xmath39 discussed above and will be developed below in order to study the superconducting transition with respect to the position of the attractive potential .",
    "for a two - component order parameter with a separable form , the corresponding gap equations may be written as@xcite @xmath40 here , since we want to study the competition between the @xmath1 and others symmetries , we have always taken @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the complex component can either be @xmath44 or @xmath45 with @xmath46 or @xmath47 and the gap functions are @xmath48 or @xmath49 respectively . now , separating the real and imaginary parts and combining eq.[gapf ] and eq.[gapv ] we obtain the following two gap equations @xmath50 these two equations has to be solved with the density of carriers @xmath51 equation which is given by@xcite @xmath52 thus we solve self - consistently the above 3 equations ( eq.[gapff ] and eq.[dens ] ) in order to study the phase diagram of a complex admixture of the order parameter .",
    "these equations are general in the sense that they can be applied to any type of two component symmetry mixtures .",
    "the results will be discussed below .",
    "= 3.6truein    we start with the analysis for the complex mixing with the two most relevant@xcite symmetries , the @xmath1 and the @xmath3 which we write as @xmath53 .",
    "we have solved the above self consistent equations with fixed @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which these values were chosen in order to obtain reasonable values for the critical temperatures @xmath0 in the range of parameters studied . in this way",
    "we obtain a maximum @xmath56k for b=1 and by the dominant @xmath1 symmetry near the optimum doping . in fig.1",
    "we show the results for the values of @xmath57 in order to compare with the experimental results of allgeier et al@xcite on @xmath58 ( bi2212 ) .",
    "notice that their maximum @xmath0 occur at @xmath59 while our calculations yield a maximum @xmath0 at @xmath6 and this discrepancy is probably due the dispersion relation that we used since a similar bcs mean field calculation using the hubbard hamiltonian ( for b=1 ) gives a maximum which agrees with the experimental result@xcite .",
    "we should point out that the comparison with a htsc experimental phase diagram , as in fig.1 , has only meaning if the material has a bcs type behavior , that is , when the appearance of the superconducting gap and phase coherence occur simultaneously at the onset of superconductivity . on the other hand , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) on underdoped bi2212",
    "has revealed the presence of a `` pseudogap '' above @xmath0@xcite which has also been confirmed by recently fermi surface arpes measurements@xcite .",
    "this unusual behavior may be an indication of non - bcs behavior which @xmath0 is controlled by the doping level , at underdoped regime , rather then by phase coherence with a single particle gap @xmath60@xcite .",
    "nevertheless this is not a completely settled scenario which only more experiments will give the correct interpretation specially because the pseudogap has not yet been seen in several cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "= 3.6truein    in the fig.2 we show the results for the zero temperature gap amplitudes @xmath61 ( continuous line ) and @xmath62 ( dashed line ) as function of the density @xmath63 for three values of the parameter @xmath5 , namely @xmath64 and @xmath65 . where there is superconductivity region , the values of @xmath66 have their maxima at zero temperature and vanishes at @xmath0 in agreement with the bcs method .",
    "in fact , the self - consistent calculations yields the temperature , the density @xmath63 and the value of the gap as one solves eqs . 5 and 6 simultaneously . in fig.3",
    "we show how the gap changes with the temperatue .",
    "the zero temperature gap value is proportional to @xmath0 and the constant of proportionality differs slightly from one channel to the other .",
    "we get @xmath67 in the optimally region .",
    "= 3.6truein    there are very interesting differences from the @xmath7 and @xmath68 channels which arises as we vary the parameter @xmath5 . for @xmath69 , the values of @xmath61",
    "are basically suppressed while for @xmath70 its its strength is decreased by about half of its value for @xmath27 ( which agrees with the calculations of ref.@xcite ) and does not move appreciably from the optimum doping value of hole content @xmath71 ( @xmath63 is the fraction of holes per cu atom in the @xmath72 sheet ) .",
    "this result is a little higher then the experimental result@xcite which yields @xmath73 for the bi optimum doping value .",
    "the maximum @xmath0 is related with the envelope of the curve shown in fig.2 . on the other hand , for the extended @xmath7 , @xmath62 ,",
    "the change in @xmath5 causes the value of the corresponding optimum doping density to change continuously ; it is at @xmath74 for @xmath69 and and about @xmath73 for @xmath70 as it is seen in figs.2a , 2b and 2c . at @xmath27 ( fig.2a ) ,",
    "the s - wave has the optimum doping at @xmath75 , for @xmath69 the maximum @xmath0 occurs at @xmath76 and it dominates over @xmath77 which is almost entirely suppressed . for @xmath70",
    "the competition between the two channels becomes very interesting ; the maximum of @xmath78 has moved to @xmath79 while the maximum of @xmath77 remains fixed at @xmath80 which gives rise to a completely novel _ doubled crossover phenomena _ ; up to @xmath81 the self - consistent equations yields pure extended s - wave solutions . between @xmath82",
    "the mixing of order parameters starts at low temperatures but with the s - channel dominating over the d - channel as its critical temperature @xmath0 is larger as shown in fig.2c and at fig.3a for @xmath83 .    at @xmath84",
    "a crossover arises and the d - channel solutions dominates over the s - channel which becomes the minor component as shown in fig.2c and fig.3b",
    ". there is always mixing at low temperatures ( the continuous curve of the minor s - wave never vanishes completely ) but the d - channel is the only one at @xmath0 . at @xmath85",
    "there is a new crossover and the dominant solution changes again as the s - wave becomes the dominant solution and the only one at @xmath0 and the d - wave appears again at low temperatures as the minor components as displayed in fig.2c and fig.3c .",
    "notice that the appearance of this subdominant component is exactly as the mechanism proposed to explain the ab - oriented ybco / i / cu tunnel junction data@xcite discussed in the introduction .",
    "= 3.6truein    next we have studied the complex gap function of symmetry @xmath86 .",
    "the results are quite similar to those above ; for @xmath27 the d - state dominates and has its optimum doping at @xmath87 as shown in fig.4a . for @xmath69 the d - channel is again suppressed and the @xmath4-state is the only one and its maximum doping is also at @xmath88 as displayed in fig.3b . for @xmath70 there is again the very interesting _ doubled crossover _ between these two competing symmetries . for @xmath89",
    "there is only s - wave instability but at @xmath90 a small d - wave channel develops at low temperatures . between @xmath84 and @xmath91",
    "we find only pure @xmath1 solutions as opposed to the case shown above in fig.2c where a low temperature mixing was always present .",
    "for @xmath92 the @xmath4-channel starts to develop , initially as a minor component ( see fig.5b ) and above @xmath93 a new crossover appears as it becomes the dominant channel and the only channel at @xmath0 .",
    "thus we verified that the states @xmath94 has also the _ doubled crossover _ and the dominant regions are similar to those for @xmath53 however , there is a new feature with this type of admixture : we can see from fig.4c that , for @xmath70 , one kind of gap symmetry influences the other .",
    "one can easily see the abrupt change in @xmath49 near @xmath79 and the change in slope for both channels near @xmath85 .",
    "the new phenomenon , that is , the slightly suppression on @xmath95 of the dominant channel can also be seen on figs.5a , 5b and 5c .",
    "this is a new feature not seen in figs.3c , and this suppression is the cause of the pure d - wave solutions at the optimal region which did not occur for previous studied extended s - wave .",
    "this interesting feature may be similar to what happens in andreev scattering near surfaces as discussed in the introduction .",
    "= 3.6truein",
    "lastly we have also studied the complex order parameter mixing @xmath10 for the three values of b , however we have not found even a single crossover . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the @xmath1 channel dominates and has also its optimum value at @xmath87 and the @xmath2 appears only at low temperatures . for @xmath69 and @xmath65",
    "the @xmath2 dominates completely around the same optimal region and the other channel gives only a very small component at low temperatures .",
    "thus we do not observe any crossover for @xmath10 complex mixture , simply the interchange of dominant symmetry as we change @xmath5 .",
    "the complex mixtures in superconducting order parameter were studied here as function of hole density in the context of the bcs mean - field calculations for the extended hubbard model .",
    "we have revealed very interesting properties that may be relevant for htsc ; if the interaction is sufficiently short ranged that can be mapped by a nearest neighbor potential , at low doping , the system is described by either _ pure _ @xmath1 or @xmath3 order parameter . if the range of the potential is larger the system changes its order parameter symmetry ( for @xmath69 ) or may admit a mixed state with both @xmath7 and @xmath68 components present ( for @xmath70 ) . in this last case",
    "the dominant component depends strongly on the density or doping level @xmath63 and may change abruptly the dominant symmetry at @xmath0 . since in most",
    "htsc it is difficult to determine @xmath63 accurately@xcite and as our calculations demonstrate , a small change in @xmath63 may be accompanied by a crossover of the dominant component .",
    "if we assume an expansion with @xmath96 like that of the spin fluctuation theory of ref.@xcite , then one must look at their weight to see which one is more important and concomitantly , which symmetry of the order parameter is the dominant one .",
    "this present work provides a hint to understand why different order parameter symmetries appear in different experiments performed on the same type of compounds .",
