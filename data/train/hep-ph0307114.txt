    "the observed @xmath0  and @xmath3  states are linear combinations of two mass eigenstates , denoted here as @xmath4 and @xmath5 . due to the non - conservation of flavour in charged weak - current interactions , transitions between @xmath0  and @xmath3  states occur with a frequency proportional to @xmath6 .    experimentally , the oscillations have not yet been observed directly . the combined lower limit from measurements done by the aleph , delphi and opal experiments at lep , by sld at slc , and by cdf at the tevatron , is @xmath7  @xmath8  at 95% cl , with a sensitivity at 95% cl of 19.3  @xmath8  @xcite . in the standard model",

    "the prospects of the atlas experiment at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) to measure oscillations are presented .",
    "a detailed description of the analysis on which this presentation is based on can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . a short discussion of subsequent changes",
    "is also included .",
    "the signal channels considered in this analysis for the measurement of oscillations are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 followed by @xmath14 , selected in semileptonic events .",
    "the event samples from this simulation study were generated using pythia 5.7 @xcite , passed then through a detailed geant3-based simulation of the atlas inner detector ; charged tracks were then reconstructed using an algorithm based on the kalman filter .",
    "the production of the @xmath15-quark pairs in @xmath16 collisions at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath17  tev included direct production , gluon splitting , and flavour excitation processes .",
    "the @xmath18-quark was forced to decay semileptonically giving a muon with transverse momentum @xmath19  gev and pseudo - rapidity @xmath20 which is used by the level-1 trigger to select the @xmath21 hadronic channels in atlas , while the associated @xmath22 was forced to produce the required @xmath21-decay channels .",
    "a multi - level trigger is used in atlas to select events . for b - physics ,",
    "the level-1 trigger is an inclusive muon trigger , as mentioned before .",
    "the level-2 trigger reconfirms the muon from level-1 trigger using also the precision muon chambers , then in an un - guided search for tracks in the inner detector reconstructs a @xmath23 meson and , adding a new track , a @xmath24   meson .",
    "the level-3 trigger ( the event filter ) confirms the level-2 result using a set of loose offline cuts to select the events .",
    "the flavour of the @xmath0  meson , i.e.  the particle or antiparticle state , is tagged at the production point by the muon used for the level-1 trigger ; at the decay vertex , the meson s state is given by the charge of the reconstructed @xmath24  meson .",
    "offline , the @xmath0  meson was reconstructed from its decay products , applying kinematical cuts on reconstructed tracks , mass and vertex - fit cuts on the intermediate particles , and cuts on properties of the @xmath0candidates ( vertex - fit quality , proper time , impact parameter , mass , etc . ) .",
    "the background was estimated considering various four- or six - body @xmath21-hadron decay channels , and the combinatorial background .",
    "the four- and six - body background events were generated , passed through the detailed detector simulation program , reconstructed and analyzed using the same programs , the same conditions and the same cuts as the signal events .",
    "for the study of the combinatorial background , about 1.1  million @xmath25 events were analyzed using a fast detector simulation package .",
    "the expected number of signal and background events for an integrated luminosity of 10  @xmath26 , corresponding to a one - year run at @xmath27 ( so - called `` low luminosity '' ) are summarized in table  [ tab : nev ] . to compute them , branching ratios from ref .",
    "@xcite were taken , where known , else from pythia .",

    "this section summarizes recent changes of the assumptions or conditions used to get the results presented above .",
    "the most important changes in the detector geometry are the increase of the beam - pipe diameter from 41.5  mm to 50.5  mm and the increase of the pixel length in b - layer , the closest layer to the beam - pipe , from 300  @xmath28 m to 400  @xmath28 m .    due to financial constraints ,",
    "the b - physics trigger resources have to be minimized .",
    "previously , dedicated resources were supposed to be available for the b - physics trigger , in addition to resources for high-@xmath29  physics trigger ( ` discovery physics trigger ' ) .",
    "it may not be possible to provide any significant additional resources . moreover , there are financial uncertainties which could lead to the deferral of some detector items , therefore it is possible to have a reduced detector at start - up .",
    "items included in the deferral scenario are the second pixel layer from the inner detector , resulting in a two - layer pixel detector , the @xmath30 region of the transition radiation detector from the inner detector , and a significant part of the processors for level-2 and event filter , reducing the computing resources for the high - level trigger and limiting the level-1 rate .",
    "the luminosity target for lhc start - up doubled to @xmath31  @xmath32s@xmath33 , therefore it will be necessary to re - evaluate trigger thresholds and to remove some triggers requiring too much resources .",
    "the trigger for @xmath0  oscillation channels requires a significant rate , therefore it is very likely that the muon trigger threshold will be raised to @xmath34  gev .",
    "recent work concentrates on trigger - related issues ; improvements of the offline analysis , although possible , have to be postponed . to reduce the resource requirements",
    ", one of the possibilities would be to change the trigger for @xmath21 hadronic channels from @xmath35 at level-1 plus inner detector full scan at level-2 to @xmath35 at level-1 , plus a low @xmath36 level-1 calorimeter region - of - interest ( roi ) , used then to guide reconstruction at level-2 .",
    "in addition , one can use the level-2 roi to limit the region for reconstruction at the event filter . a flexible trigger and analysis strategy is nowadays evaluated , which should be able to cope with detector changes , luminosity scenarios , financial problems .",
    "another direction is to recover performance using optimized reconstruction algorithms , flexible trigger and analysis thresholds .",
    "a re - evaluation of the detector performance with the latest geometry is also under way .",
    "preliminary results are encouraging ."
