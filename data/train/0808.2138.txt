    "the traditional measurements of the specific heat @xmath1 at constant volume or @xmath2 at constant pressure involve cooling ( or heating ) the sample at a constant rate @xcite .",
    "when applied to glass - forming systems , this approach has an inherent difficulty . since glass - forming system tend to relax to equilibrium slower and slower as the temperature",
    "is lowered , at some point the ` constant rate ' of cooling becomes too high for the system to respond to , and then the system does not reach equilibrium .",
    "typically the specific heat then drops abruptly , giving rise to the  specific heat peak \" at some temperature which is sometimes identified as the glass transition temperature @xmath3 .",
    "needless to say , such a definition of transition temperature is less than compelling , since it clearly depends on the rate of cooling and is not inherent to the system properties .    in an attempt to overcome this difficulty birge and nagel @xcite introduced `` specific heat spectroscopy '' . in this technique",
    "one keeps the sample close to a temperature @xmath4 at all times , but perturbs it periodically with a small - amplitude oscillation of frequency @xmath5 .",
    "linear response theory then relates the amount of heat exchanged at that frequency , @xmath6 to the oscillatory temperature perturbation @xmath7 via the relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the frequency dependent specific heat that can be measured at either constant volume or constant pressure . in order to find the thermodynamic specific heat one needs to extrapolate data to the @xmath10 limit . whether or not this extrapolation overcomes",
    "the above - mentioned worry of sufficient relaxation time is an issue that has not been fully clarified in the literature .    in this paper",
    "we concern ourselves with the theoretical calculation of the specific heat in glass - forming systems and in the relation of the specific heat to other material properties . to this aim",
    "we focus on one simulational example ( a binary mixture of point particles interacting via an @xmath11 repulsive potential ) and one experimental example ( glycerol ) . in the context of the first example we present results of new simulations that exhibit two distinct peaks in the curve of the specific heat vs. the temperature .",
    "we present for this example various theoretical results , culminating with a new scenario to explain the specific heat peaks , i.e. the micro - melting of clusters .",
    "we believe that this is the central point of the present paper . to understand the nature of the specific heat anomalies one must understand the physics that is behind the glassy behavior of this model in general and the existence of the two specific heat peaks in particular . when the temperature is lowered at a fixed pressure this system @xcite ( as well as many other glass - formers @xcite tends to form micro - clusters of local order . in the present case large particles",
    "form long - lived patches of hexagonal ordering first ( starting at about @xmath12 , and at lower temperatures ( around @xmath13 ) also the small particles form long - lived hexagonal clusters .",
    "the clusters are not that huge , with at most o(100 ) particles , ( cf .",
    "[ clusters ] ) , depending on the temperature and the aging time .",
    "but we have shown that the long time properties of correlation functions are entirely carried by the micro - clusters @xcite .",
    "below we will refer to the micro - clusters as curds and the liquid phase as whey .",
    "we will argue that the specific heat responds to the micro - melting of the clusters - those of small particles at the lowest temperatures and those of the larger particles at higher temperatures .",
    "the large increase in the number of degrees of freedom when a particle leaves a crystalline cluster and joins the liquid background is the basic reason for the increase in entropy that is seen as a specific heat peak .",

    "we highlight the clusters of large particles in local hexagonal order .",
    "the colours have no meaning.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=65.0% ]    in the context of the second example we show that the calculation of the frequency dependent specific heat is easy when we have a reasonable model of the glassy relaxation .",
    "having such a model for glycerol @xcite , we demonstrate in section [ glycerol ] that the information gained from the frequency dependent specific heat is very similar to that learned from other linear response functions like broad - band dielectric spectroscopy",
    ". we will be able therefore to present spectra of the frequency dependent specific heat in close correspondence with experiments .",
    "the specific heat has interesting relations with the mechanical moduli of the material , and we present relations ( which pertain to any system with an @xmath14 potential ) to the bulk and shear moduli . as a result of our thinking",
    "we conclude that the bulk and shear moduli change rapidly in the temperature range of the two distinct specific heat peaks mentioned above .",
    "the relation to the bulk modulus is explicit , and is shown rigorously in subsect .",
    "[ mechanics ] .",
    "the relation to the shear modulus is less explicit , simply because one does not have an equation of state with strain ( a quantity that is ill defined in the context of glasses ) .",
    "nevertheless we present a conjecture that the bulk and shear moduli in generic glasses may change rapidly at two different temperature ranges .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ binary ] we present the model glass consisting of a binary mixture of point particles interacting via soft potentials , and discuss its thermodynamic properties .",
    "we derive exact equations for its specific heat at constant volume , which are correct at all temperatures through the glass transition .",
    "we compare these results to molecular dynamics simulations in which special care had been taken to equilibrate the system , summarizing a computational effort of about two years .",
    "the main conclusion of this section is that the details of the interaction potential are crucial in determining what the specific heat does in the vicinity of the glass transition , and there is nothing universal about it . for a simple enough potential we can derive a theory that is in excellent agreement with simulations up to the first specific heat peak . to explain both peaks we must present a theory that takes into account explicitly the tendency of the system to form micro - clusters @xcite .",
    "the state of the system then becomes like curds of local crystalline order embedded in a whey of disordered fluid .",
    "it is the freezing or melting of these curds that account quantitatively for the specific heat peaks , as is shown in subsect .",

    "[ glycerol ] we turn to discussing the frequency - dependent complex specific heat . to construct a theory of this object one needs a model of the dynamics of the system under study , be it glycerol or any other material .",

( [ epot ] ) ) , therefore : @xmath50 due to this property of the interaction potential we find a connection between the pressure and the temperature and mean energy : @xmath51 this equation is exact for one component and multicomponent systems and is valid at all temperatures , from liquid to solid .",
    "the next simplification for systems with an inverse power inter - particle interaction consists in the dependence of all excess thermodynamic properties relative to the ideal gas on a single density - temperature variable @xcite . to see why ,",

    "the bottom line of the simple theory described in the previous subsection is that there are two important ranges of temperature , first around @xmath128 where clusters of large particles begin to form , and a second around @xmath172 where clusters of small particles begin to appear .",
    "the first important change is also seen in the bulk modulus ; this is not surprising , since the crystalline clusters have a bulk modulus very different from the fluid . nevertheless between the clusters we still have appreciable fluid regions which act as lubricants for the response to shear .",
    "we thus expect the shear modulus to change appreciably only when the small particles begin to cluster , in the vicinity of the smaller specific heat peak .",
    "we therefore conjecture that the two specific heat peaks are also associated with changes in the bulk and shear modulus respectively .",
    "we expect that any measurements of the glass properties connected with bulk and shear moduli will show different transition temperatures if these quantities do not reach simultaneously their @xmath173 counterparts .",
    "we can not at this point asses how general is this split between bulk and shear moduli , and whether it will be seen in generic glasses .",
    "we thus leave this point for further research , stressing that we expect this phenomenon to appear whenever there exist micro - clusters of preferred oredering in the scenario of glass - forming .",
    "having an effective equation of state , albeit approximate , we can easily compute any thermodynamic derivative of interest .",
    "we wrote above explicit expressions for the compressibility and the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "others are as easily calculated .",
    "the point to stress however is how non - universal the thermodynamics is . in this model",
    "we have two specific heat peaks , in others we might have one or several . we would also expect a strong pressure dependence for these peaks .",
    "by applying time dependent heat fluxes @xmath174 to the liquid and measuring the resulting temperature fluctuations @xmath175 , the specific heat can be measured @xmath176 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , measurements of the specific heat of glassy fluids at low temperatures can in principle be made under conditions of either constant volume ( isochoric conditions ) or constant pressure ( isobaric conditions ) , but experimentally isobaric conditions are the norm .    the first and best known measurement of the frequency dependent complex specific heat was performed in glycerol , and we take these experimental results as our motivation for this section .",
    "we stress from the beginning that our approach is not particular for glycerol , and it can be applied to any other material where , as we assume for glycerol , there exists clusters of various sizes that determine the dynamical response . in order to develop a model of the frequency dependent specific heat in glycerol",
    "we will employ our own model of the glassy phase of glycerol .",
    "this model assumes that glassy glycerol is a heterogeneous fluid on macroscopic timescales .",
    "that is , that while on very long timescales the liquid phase is homogeneous , there exist localized mesoscale domains in the fluid that have macroscopic lifetimes .",
    "indeed , inhomogeneities that appear to survive for @xmath177 seconds contribute to the dielectric response in the fourier domain at frequencies as low as @xmath178 hz in some cases .",
    "clearly such imhomogeneities will also contribute to anomalies in the frequency dependent specific heat @xmath179 .",
    "we develop the theory by deriving expressions for the time - dependent enthalpy fluctuations @xmath180 that are related to the frequency dependent specific heat at constant pressure in terms of the distribution of these heterogeneities .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for an introduction to the dynamical model of glassy glycerol in which the dielectric spectra are computed in great detail .      by considering a temperature field @xmath181 and using linear response theory on an isobaric ensemble where the appropriate boltzmann distribution is @xmath182 , with the enthalpy given by @xmath183 , nielsen and dyre @xcite",
    "find that the frequency dependent specific heat is given by the form @xmath184 in eq .",
    "( [ linres ] ) @xmath185 is an enthalpy fluctuation away from equilibrium .",
    "therefore we write @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the number of clusters consisting of @xmath188 molecules in the glassy phase and @xmath189 are the remaining molecules in the mobile liquid phase .",
    "@xmath190 is the enthalpy of a cluster of @xmath188 molecules at a pressure @xmath191 and temperature @xmath4 @xmath192 in eq .",
    "( [ hs ] ) @xmath193 is the energy / molecule in the condensed phase ; @xmath194 is the volume per molecule in the condensed phase ; and @xmath195 is the surface energy per molecule .",
    "finally @xmath196 is the enthalpy per molecule in the mobile phase .    now in equilibrium we can write @xmath197 and we also have the sum rule @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the total number of molecule in the system .",
    "we can write the enthalpy fluctuations away from equilibrium at time @xmath200 as @xmath201 where @xmath202    let us first calculate the equilibrium fluctuations @xmath203 . to this end",
    "we assume that there are no correlations between the dynamics of clusters of different sizes , implying @xmath204 .",
    "then , using the expression eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) for the enthalpy fluctuations , we can immediately write that @xmath205 similarly for the time dependent enthalpy fluctuations @xmath206 we have thus reduced the correlation functions for the enthalpy fluctuations into expressions involving the fluctuations in cluster number for clusters of different sizes @xmath188 .    to estimate these correlation functions we proceed as follows .",
    "first we note that the number of molecules @xmath207 in the clusters can be written as a sum over the clusters as @xmath208 , and consequently the fluctuations in the total number of particles away from equilibrium are @xmath209 .",
    "then , assuming gaussian fluctuations we estimate the mean square fluctuations of the number of particles within some small volume @xmath210 or rewriting @xmath211 from this equation we therefore see that @xmath212    for the time dependent fluctuations therefor , assuming an independent debye relaxation for each cluster , @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the lifetime of a cluster of size @xmath188 .",
    "thus we get our final expression for the enthalpy fluctuations in equilibrium in terms of the cluster size distribution as @xmath215 and for their time dependent correlations @xmath216    we now substitute these expressions into eq .  [ linres ] with the result @xmath217 or splitting the specific heat into its real and imaginary parts @xmath218    we can now use our previous results for the cluster distributions in the case of glycerol to find the real and imaginary specific heat anomalies in the case of glycerol .",
    "we do not re - fit any of the parameters used in the calculation of the bds spectra @xcite , we simply use the previous knowledge at the temperatures indicated , and plot the results , fitting only the heat conductivity of glycerol .",
    "we approximate @xmath219 , such that eq ( [ cp ] ) is rewritten as @xmath220 splitting the specific heat into its real and imaginary parts @xmath221 the resulting curves multiplied by the thermal conductivity are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "these should be compared to fig.2 of @xcite .",
    "the reader can convince himself that the theory captures the experimental results quantitatively .",
    "-1 cm    -1 cm    we would like to stress at this point that the results obtained here are equivalent in dynamical contents to the computation of the dielectric spectra in @xcite . in that calculation one focused on the dielectric response @xmath222 and as here",
    "decomposed it into its real and imaginary parts @xmath223 .",
    "it was found in @xcite that without the dc contribution ( which is absent in the case of specific heat ) we could write @xmath224 } { \\sum_s   \\langle n_s\\rangle   s } \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\im \\epsilon ( \\omega ) } { ( \\epsilon_0 - \\epsilon_{\\infty } ) } & = &   \\frac{\\sum_s   \\langle n_s\\rangle   s ( \\omega \\tau_s)/[1 + ( \\omega \\tau_s)^2 ] } { \\sum_s   \\langle n_s\\rangle   s } \\nonumber   .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] once normalized the specific heat spectra are identical these spectra .",
    "the reason for the identity is in the assumptions that @xmath225 and @xmath226 , cf .",
    ". on the other hand the role of the relaxation times @xmath214 and the distribution of cluster sizes are exactly the same in the two expressions .",
    "probably the most glaring consequence of the calculations presented in this paper is that the specific heat is a valuable indicator of the interesting physics that occurs during the glass transition , but this transition is in no way universal .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat is determined by details like inter - particle potentials and micro - melting or micro - formation of clusters . in this sense",
    "any hope for universality is untenable .",
    "nevertheless we have shown that the specific heat peaks herald interesting new physics , leading to fast changes in the mechanical moduli which are also associated with fast changes in the inhomogeneities that are crucial for the glassy behavior , i.e. the formation of micro - clusters .",
    "we propose that the appearance of two specific heat peaks in the case of the binary mixture indicates two different ranges for the increase in moduli , the bulk modulus at higher temperatures when the first type of clusters form , and the shear modulus when the other type of clusters form , and the lubricating effect that allows the system to shear disappears .",
    "all this interesting physics is indicated by the behavior of the thermodynamics specific heat . as for the complex specific heat we have shown , in the context of the example of glycerol , that the physics revealed by the complex specific heat compared to other methods of linear response like broad dielectric spectroscopy are identical . in fact ,",
    "a straightforward consequence of our model for glycerol is the prediction that the spectra measured from specific heat can be divided by the spectra computed , say , from bds and the result should be a constant number .",
    "we do not have data for exactly the same temperature , but such an experiment would be very useful for the near future .",
    "it is interesting to see in future research whether the two specific heat peaks discussed above may be seen in other systems , or may be an even richer scenario can appear , with more peaks , when more types of clusters intervene in the process of glass - formation .",
    "we are grateful to sid nagel and sasha voronel for discussion , both in person and electronic , regarding their measurements of specific heat .",
    "this work had been supported in part by the german israeli foundation , the minerva foundation , munich , germany and the israel science foundation .",
    "t follows from the simulation results that at lower temperatures the specific heat is at least close to the value of the solid .",
    "therefore , we can write the energy of the system in the harmonic approximation : @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the potential energy of the system in the reference state , @xmath229 are expansion coefficients and @xmath230 is a cartesian coordinate of the deviation of the current position of a particle from equilibrium .",
    "there are @xmath231 degrees of freedom ( neglecting translations and rotations of the system ) in ( [ harm ] ) , therefore it follows from the equipartition theorem that the average potential energy of the system in the solid state is @xcite : @xmath232 substituting([usol ] ) in ( [ sphv ] ) immediately yields @xmath46 for two dimensional solids . at the equilibrium configuration the potential energy ( [ energy ] ) of the binary mixture model ( [ epot ] )",
    "is given by : @xmath233 due to the scaling properties of the inverse power potential it is possible to normalize the interparticle distances by the typical distance ( [ dist ] ) @xmath234 @xcite : @xmath235 where the constant @xmath236 is independent of the density . note that this constant is known as the madelung constant in solid - state physics .",
    "taking into account ( [ uref1 ] ) the average potential energy of a harmonic solid ( [ usol ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath237      the value of the constant @xmath238 can be calculated simulationally using eq .",
    "( [ usol1 ] ) ; the results are shown in fig.[cfig4 ] .",
    "one can see that below @xmath66 the change of this constant is small . nevertheless , this change reflects the fact that our calculations at the smallest values of the temperature are not fully relaxed to equilibrium even though we took extreme care . typically at the lowest temperatures the system can be trapped for incredibly long times in a local minimum of the energy surface , where each local minimum having slightly different equations of state @xcite .",
    "while we expect the madelung constant to be unique for a given crystal , our system here contains clusters of preferred structures with random orientations @xcite , and therefore the analog of the madelung constant is not strictly defined .",
    "it may very well depend on the protocol of cooling .",
    "the present best estimate of the value of this parameter at the lowest temperatures is @xmath239 .",
    "the caloric equation of state ( [ usol1 ] ) substituted to the virial equation ( [ virpres ] ) gives the following thermal equation : @xmath240 the value of the renormalized constant @xmath241 can be compared with the result for the two dimensional one - component system with hexagonal crystal , which is @xmath242 @xcite . the fact that this constant is expected to increase in an amorphous solid was anticipated in @xcite .    finally , we note from ( [ eqsol ] ) that in contrast to a crystalline solid the thermal ( caloric ) equation of state here remains ambiguous because the value of @xmath238 depends on the preparation protocol . with this in mind",
    "it becomes fruitless to seek the anharmonic corrections to equation ( [ eqsol ] ) as in the case of a one component system with a well - defined reference state at low temperatures .",
