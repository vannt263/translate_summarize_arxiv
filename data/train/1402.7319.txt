    "we next discuss the onsite potential , as a function of the type of site . as was seen in sec.[structure_sec ] , each of the families of sites a , b , ... corresponds to a domain in @xmath28 .",
    "the points near the origin , which correspond to a sites of the ot , have large values of the intensity , and the intensity diminishes as one goes to the b , c , .. , out to the f sites .",
    "thus , the peak intensity is decreasing as one goes from @xmath168 ( a sites ) down to @xmath169 ( f sites ) .",
    "in other words , the @xmath168 sites are located in the deepest potential wells .",
    "this statement applies to the mean value of @xmath72 for each class of sites , while the actual value for a given site will lie within a certain interval around the mean value .",
    "fig.[histo.fig ] shows the spread of values of the local intensity corresponding to each value of @xmath128 .",
    "the maximum and minimum values of the potential were calculated based on the perpendicular space dependence of the intensity shown in fig.[perppot.fig ] using the domains shown in fig.[fig_ota ] .",
    "this interval grows as @xmath128 is reduced : the distribution is narrow for a sites , and gets fairly broad for the e and f sites .     for the @xmath114 tiling .",
    "the dashed line is a guide to the eye . ]",
    "twin - pairs , as defined in sec.[structure_sec ] are pairs of sites which are close together in real space . in @xmath28 , they are at opposite ends the selection window , such that their distances from the origin @xmath170 are very similar . since the intensity is a smooth function of @xmath170 , the difference of peak intensity between two twin f sites will therefore be small . as a consequence of this property",
    ", a small repulsive interaction between particles should be sufficient to raise the energy of a twin - pair , making it energetically unfavorable .",
    "conversely , it would become favorable to occupy empty hexagons and octagons , since the empty site in their centers corresponds to an intensity which is just below the cutoff .",
    "thus , in conclusion , small repulsive interactions should induce a transformation of the oq into the ot .",
    "this is an interesting possibility , since there is a large body of work devoted to studying models of electronic and vibrational properties of the ot @xcite .",
    "we examine in the section the problem of the behavior of @xmath10 between two adjacent sites in the optical quasicrystal .",
    "this information is relevant , for example , in discussions of the tunnelling probability between adjacent sites .",
    "a priori , it is clear that the variations of the intensity should be different for each pair of sites in the quasicrystal .",

    "we describe below the typical intensity profiles for two types of nearest neighbors in a qualitative fashion , leaving a more complete study for a future work .",
    "the two kinds of pairs are i ) _ edge - linked pairs _ where the distance between sites is @xmath171 ( the edge length ) and ii ) _ small - diagonal pairs _ where the distance between the pair is the length of a small diagonal of the 45@xmath0 rhombus , @xmath172 .",
    "the simplest case is that of the densest theoretical structure , the @xmath111 optical quasicrystal ( not realizable using the intensity cut - off method ) .",

    "moving from site @xmath173 to site @xmath174 corresponds , in 4d space , to going along a body diagonal .",
    "the function @xmath68 must have at least one zero along this path , since the amplitude @xmath175 changes from @xmath176 to @xmath177 .",
    "after projecting into the physical plane @xmath27,the intensity would go from a local maximum , through zero , and back up to a local maximum .",

    "moving from site @xmath173 to site @xmath174 corresponds , in 4d space , to going along an edge of the 4d hypercube .",
    "the intensity would evolve from a local maximum to another local maximum without passing through zero in between .",
    "+ we now consider the physically relevant @xmath114 oq , where neighboring sites are spaced further apart and belong in different unit cells in 4d .",
    "this leads to intensity variations which have a more complicated dependence upon distance .",
    "there are additional maxima and minima between the start and finish , compared to the simple case discussed above .",
    "however there is still a strong similarity between the curves obtained for each of the two cases i ) sites joined by an edge and ii ) sites lying across the small diagonal .",
    "this is now shown by numerical computation , for the case of the optical quasicrystal obtained by imposing the cutoff value @xmath178 . for pairs joined by an edge",
    ", results are shown in fig.[bond1.fig]a , where the variation of the intensity @xmath179 is plotted as a function of the distance along the edge @xmath180 for a large number of pairs .",
    "the curves are individually distinct , however they show similar qualitative behavior .",
    "a similar set of computations was carried out for sites separated by a short diagonal , with the results shown in fig.[bond1.fig]b .",
    "these plots indicate that the intensity profile is determined by the type of pair ( joined along an edge or along the small diagonal ) to first approximation .",
    "one can expect therefore the tunnelling amplitude between sites should be approximately of the same order of magnitude for pairs of a given type .",

    "we thank u. grimm for bringing ref.@xcite to our attention .",
    "in this appendix , we review briefly some properties relating to 8-fold symmetry , namely , invariance under rotations by @xmath183 with @xmath184 . the octagonal group @xmath62 has 16 elements : in 2 dimensions , the 8-fold generator is a rotation @xmath185 of @xmath186 or @xmath187 of @xmath188 , giving rise to inequivalent representations of the group .",

    "this representation of @xmath62 is reducible : the 4d space @xmath69 splits into the planes @xmath27 and @xmath28 defined above which are invariant and carry inequivalent irreducible representations of the group .",
    "the restriction of @xmath190 to @xmath27 is the rotation @xmath185 of angle @xmath54 whereas the restriction to @xmath28 is the rotation @xmath187 of angle @xmath56 .",

    "when @xmath14 tends to 16@xmath182 , the acceptance domains associated with each of the bcc lattice points shrink and their shapes tend to spheres , while their projections on @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) tend to disks @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) of radius @xmath86 .",
    "if such a domain @xmath84 cuts the plane @xmath27 , the local maximum of @xmath72 occurs at a point @xmath90 which converges to the projection @xmath91 of @xmath92 in the limit @xmath93 .",
