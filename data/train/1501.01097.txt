    "high temperature superconductivity continued to be one of the thrust area in condensed matter research for many decades , where most of the focus has been centered around the study of cuprates superconductors @xcite .",
    "discovery of superconductivity in fe - based compounds @xcite renewed great attention in the study of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "fe - based systems are significantly different from the cuprates .",
    "the parent compounds in cuprates are antiferromagnetic mott insulators , where the insulating property arises due to strong electron correlation compared to the width of their conduction band .",
    "the antiferromagnetism gets suppressed with the charge carrier doping and superconductivity emerges beyond some critical doping .",
    "the normal phase of these materials exhibit plethora of unusual behavior such as pseudogap phase , strange metallicity etc .    on the other hand ,",
    "the parent compounds of fe - based compounds ( pnictides or chalcogenides ) are metals exhibiting spin density wave ( sdw ) phase in the ground state .",
    "charge carrier doping in these systems leads to superconductivity via suppression of long range magnetic order in the parent compositions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , many of these fe - based compounds exhibit pressure induced superconductivity @xcite .",
    "application of pressure usually renormalizes the hopping interaction strengths due to the compression / distortion of the real lattice without significant change in the overall carrier concentration .",
    "thus , the finding of pressure induced superconductivity expands the domain of unresolved puzzles significantly .",
    "most interestingly , some fe - based compounds exhibit an unusual coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity @xcite .    here",
    ", we review the experimental results of two fe - based superconductors , fe(tese ) and cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 belonging to two difference class of materials published earlier @xcite and try to bring out common features among these materials .",
    "fe(tese ) group of compounds , popularly known as ` 11 ' systems forms in anti - pbo - type crystal structure ( space group @xmath3 ) @xcite , and are believed to be the most correlated ones due to their large ` chalcogen height ' @xcite ( the height of the anions from the fe - plane ) @xcite .",
    "the end members , fete exhibits spin density wave ( sdw)-type antiferromagnetic transition at 65 k @xcite and fese is a superconductor below 8 k @xcite .",
    "homovalent substitution of te at se - sites in fese leads to an increase in superconducting transition temperature , @xmath4 with maximum @xmath4 of 15 k for 60% te - substitutions @xcite , despite the fact that such substitutions often introduces disorder in the system that is expected to reduce the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 belong to another class of materials known as ` 122 ' compounds and crystallize in the thcr@xmath2si@xmath2 type tetragonal structure at room temperature , ( space group @xmath5 ) .",
    "cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 exhibits sdw transition due to the long range magnetic ordering of the fe moments at @xmath6 = 170 k along with a structural transition to an orthorhombic phase .",
    "high pressure @xcite , substitution of fe by co , ni@xcite and other dopants induces superconductivity in cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "the sdw transition is found to accompany a nesting of the fermi surface @xcite along with a transition from two dimensional ( 2d ) to three dimensional ( 3d ) fermi surface associated with the structural transition @xcite .",
    "it is believed that fe 3@xmath0 states play dominant role in the electronic properties of these systems in contrast to cuprates , where the doped holes possess dominant ligand 2@xmath1 orbital character @xcite .",
    "thus , the physics of unconventional superconductors is complex due to the significant differences among different classes of materials . here",
    ", we show that the ligand @xmath1 electrons play much more important role than what was anticipated .",
    "the temperature evolution of the electronic structure reveals interesting scenario in these materials .",
    "the single crystals of cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 were grown using sn flux and the single crystalline sample of fete@xmath7se@xmath8 @xcite was grown by self flux method .",
    "the grown crustals were characterized by @xmath9-ray diffraction , laue , mussbauer and tunneling electron microscopic measurements establishing stoichiometric and homogeneous composition of the sample with no trace of additional fe in the material .",
    "the grown crystals are flat platelet like , which can be cleaved easily and the cleaved surface looked mirror shiny .",
    "photoemission measurements were carried out using a gammadata scienta analyzer , r4000 wal and monochromatic photon sources , al @xmath10 ( @xmath11 = 1486.6 ev ) , he i ( @xmath11 = 21.2 ev ) and he ii ( @xmath11 = 40.8 ev ) sources . the energy resolution and angle resolution were set to 2 mev and 0.3@xmath12 respectively for ultraviolet photoemission ( up ) studies and the energy resolution was fixed to 350 mev for @xmath9-ray photoemission ( xp ) measurements .",
    "the sample was cleaved _ in situ _",
    "( base pressure @xmath13  10@xmath14 torr ) at each temperature several times to have a clean well ordered surface for the photoemission studies .",
    "reproducibility of the data in both cooling and heating cycle was observed .",
    "the energy band structure of cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 and fete@xmath15se@xmath15 was calculated using full potential linearized augmented plane wave method within the local density approximation ( lda ) using wien2k software @xcite .",

    "( b ) near fermi level feature from he i and he ii excitations .",
    "( c ) evolution of the xp valence band spectra near @xmath17 with temperatures . ]    as discussed above , the major difference of fe - based superconductors with the cuprates is believed to be the character of the conduction electrons . in cuprates ,",
    "the charge transfer energy (= the energy required to transfer an electron from ligand to the copper site ) is smaller than the electron correlation strength @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fermi level , @xmath17 lies at the top of the o 2@xmath1 band and the electrons close to the fermi level possess dominant o 2@xmath1 character .",
    "the electron correlation strength in fe - pnictides is expected to be relatively smaller @xcite and the electrons close to @xmath17 were described to be dominated by fe 3@xmath0 character .",
    "this appears to be the case in the valence band spectrum of cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath9-ray photoemission ( xp ) spectrum at 300 k exhibits four distinct features , a , b , c and d @xcite .",
    "the calculated spectral functions obtained by convoluting the the band structure results with the fermi - dirac function and resolution broadening function exhibit good representation of the experimental spectra .",
    "it is clear that the feature a possesses dominant fe 3@xmath0 contributions ( dashed line ) , while the as 4@xmath1 states ( solid line ) contribute at higher binding energies .    in order to learn this better",
    ", we critically investigate the electronic states close to @xmath17 .",
    "it appears that the hybridization between as 4@xmath1 and fe 3@xmath0 states is quite strong with significant contribution coming from as 4@xmath1 pdos near @xmath17 as shown by solid circles in the figure .",
    "this is further examined experimentally in fig .",
    "1(b ) by comparing the spectra obtained using he i and he ii excitations .",
    "the atomic photoemission cross - section for fe 3@xmath0 and as 4@xmath1 at he i energy excitation are 4.833 & 3.856 , and at he ii are 8.761 & 0.2949 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , relative intensity corresponding to as 4@xmath1 states will increase significantly at he i energy compared to he ii energy .",
    "the comparison of the he i and he ii spectra having same resolution broadening suggests that the contribution of as 4@xmath1 states at the fermi level is indeed large compared to the band structure results shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) .    the temperature evolution of the feature a in the xp valence band spectra is shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) after normalizing by the spectral intensities in the energy range beyond 1 ev binding energy .",
    "the intensity of the feature a exhibits gradual enhancement with the decrease in temperature .",
    "valence band spectra of a correlated system exhibit signature of upper and lower hubbard bands constituted by the correlated electronic states ( often called incoherent feature ) and a kondo resonance feature called coherent feature appears at the fermi level representing the itinerant electrons .",
    "the decrease in temperature leads to an increase in the coherent feature intensity at the cost of incoherent features @xcite .",
    "while such increase in spectral intensity can have other origin @xcite , we strongly feel , the enhancement of the feature a with the decrease in temperature shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) can be attributed to correlation induced effects as justified later in the text .",

    "2(a ) , we show the valence band spectra of fete@xmath7se@xmath8 obtained using al @xmath10 @xmath9-ray source at 10 k and 300 k @xcite .",
    "the valence band exhibit multiple features - the feature close to @xmath17 possess dominant fe 3@xmath0 character and te / se @xmath1 related features primarily contribute in the energy range 2 - 7 ev as also appeared in the case of cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "the higher binding energy features correspond to se / te @xmath18 states excitations . a comparison of the near fermi level feature at 10 k obtained using different photon energies exhibit interesting scenario .",
    "the feature around 100 mev is most intense in the he i spectra indicating again large chalcogen @xmath1 contributions .",
    "decrease in temperature leads to a gradual increase in intensity of the near @xmath17 feature as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) consistent with the scenario in correlated electron systems .",
    "the correlation induced effect can be verified further by inspecting the fe 2@xmath1 core level spectra shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) . the spectra exhibit an interesting evolution with temperature .",
    "the intensity of the peak around 707 ev binding energy increases gradually with the decrease in temperature ( see inset ) .",
    "this feature is often referred as the well screened feature , where the core hole created by photoemission is screened by a conduction electron in the final state @xcite .",
    "since the decrease in temperature leads to an enhancement of the coherent feature intensity with a consequent decrease in the incoherent feature intensity @xcite , the core hole is expected to be more efficiently screened at lower temperatures as more number of mobile electrons are available at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , the temperature evolution of the core level spectra observed here can also be attributed to the correlation induced effect discussed for the valence band .    ,",

    "finite electron correlation leads to a spectral weight transfer from @xmath17 to higher binding energies leading to an enhancement of the intensity around 2 ev ( incoherent feature ) .",
    "electron correlation affects the electronic states with different orbital character differently depending on their degree of itineracy in the uncorrelated system @xcite .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "3 exhibiting significant transfer of the fe 3@xmath0 partial density of states ( pdos ) to higher binding energies .",
    "however , the se 4@xmath1  /  te 5@xmath1 contributions increase near @xmath17 . thus , the relative intensity of the @xmath1-states near @xmath17 will be enhanced significantly with respect to the fe @xmath0 states .",
    "this explains the presence of dominant @xmath1 character near @xmath17 in the experiment .",

    "various angle resolved photoemission spectroscopic measurements @xcite show that the fermi surface corresponding to all these three bands exhibit two - dimensional topology at room temperature , where the sample has tetragonal structure .",
    "the signature of these three bands are observed in the momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) at 300 k in the he i and he ii spectra shown in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath25 bands possessing @xmath33 symmetry appear almost degenerate , while the @xmath20 band having @xmath34 symmetry distinctly appear at slightly higher binding energies @xcite .",

    "the fermi surfaces corresponding to @xmath25 and @xmath35 bands are nested leading to the sdw transition in these materials @xcite .    with the decrease in temperature below the sdw transition temperature , the @xmath25 band hole pocket and the @xmath35 band electron pocket vanishes opening up a gap at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the crystal structure also changes from tetragonal to orthorhombic that leads to a change in the fermi surface topology - the fermi surface corresponding to the @xmath20 band exhibit @xmath29-dependence indicating its transition to three dimensionality @xcite .",
    "it is observed that in the orthorhombic phase , the @xmath20-band hole pocket is centered around @xmath36 and it is absent around @xmath37 in the @xmath16-plane containing @xmath29 axis .",
    "thus , @xmath20 band is expected to cross @xmath17 at he i energy , while it will appear below @xmath17 at he ii energy .",

    "5(a ) and 5(b ) , respectively exhibiting exactly the same scenario .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath20 band in the he i spectra also appears below @xmath17 at 10 k as shown in fig .",
    "5(c ) indicating the vanishing of the fermi surface corresponding to the @xmath20 band at 10 k - larger intensity of the @xmath20 band in he ii spectra compared to that in he i spectra indicate its dominant fe 3@xmath0 character .",
    "it is to note here that many of the unconventional superconductors exhibit signature of lifshitz transition @xcite .",
    "if the fermi level is in proximity to a point separating hole- and electron - type fermi surfaces , a small change in a tuning parameter such as doping , pressure would lead to a transition from an electron - type to hole - type fermi surface or vise versa .",
    "this is known as lifshitz transition .",
    "proximity to lifshitz transition indicates significant quantum fluctuation in the system .",
    "the signature of lifshitz transition has been observed due to subtle change in charge carrier concentration in cuprates @xcite as well as in electron doped ba(fe@xmath38co@xmath39)@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the hole fermi surface corresponding to the @xmath20 in cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 as a function of temperature is interesting and akin to the scenario in lifshitz transition .",
    "these results indicate importance of lifshitz transition in such unconventional superconductors .",
    "in summary , we presented here a review of our studies of the electronic structure of fe - based superconductors , fete@xmath7se@xmath8 and cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "a critical analysis of the experimental and band structure results indicates that the electronic states close to the fermi level deriving the electronic properties of these materials possess significantly large @xmath1 character .",
