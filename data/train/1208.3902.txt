    "the bose - hubbard model was originally introduced to describe the behavior of superfluids in disordered environments , where superfluidity could be lost by phase fluctuations induced via disorder ( bose glass ) and where potential - energy effects could localize the system into a mott insulator  @xcite . while much work ensued on examining the properties of this model within the context of disordered superconductors , it was later proposed that this model could describe the behavior of bosonic atoms placed on optical lattices  @xcite , which was experimentally realized soon thereafter  @xcite .",
    "since the atoms in an optical lattice are also held to a small region of space via a trapping potential , the experimental systems are further complicated by being in an inhomogeneous environment .",
    "this is sometimes viewed as an advantage , as one can approximately map out the homogeneous phase diagram from the inhomogeneous system if the local - density approximation holds , but it also complicates much of the theoretical analysis , because the systems are no longer translationally invariant , so momentum is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "the model was extensively studied numerically even before the application to ultracold atoms was known . in this early work ,",
    "the system was always assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "monte carlo simulations in one dimension  @xcite and two dimensions  @xcite , density matrix renormalization group work  @xcite , as well as analytic approximations , like the strong - coupling approach  @xcite , were carried out . after the experimental measurements of the mott insulator were completed  @xcite , much further work ensued , culminating in the current state - of - the - art in quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite , in density - matrix renormalization group calculations  @xcite and in experimental determinations of the phase diagram , including corrections to the local density approximation  @xcite . while much is known about the phase diagrams , less",
    "is known about the many - body spectral functions and self - energies of the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the many - body density of states ( dos ) has been calculated via maximum entropy analytic continuation of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) data  @xcite , via the variational cluster approach ( vca )  @xcite , via the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach  @xcite and approximately with a bosonic version of dynamical mean - field theory in the strong - coupling limit  @xcite .    here",
    ", we describe how to derive exact sum rules for the spectral functions of the retarded green s function ( zeroth and first three moments ) and of the retarded self - energy ( zeroth and first moment ) .",
    "we work with the most general case , which involves both spatially inhomogeneous and nonequilibrium ( time - dependent ) hamiltonians , and also summarize the results for equilibrium and spatially homogeneous cases .",
    "this work complements previous work we have done on the nonequilibrium spectral moment sum rules for the fermi - hubbard model  @xcite , which analyzed that model for the same general conditions .",
    "but unlike the fermi - hubbard model case , where all of the sum rules for retarded functions could be evaluated simply from parameters in the hamiltonian , in the case for the bose - hubbard model , the spectral moment sum rules relate to many - body averages that are nontrivial , and need to be determined from some independent calculation in order to fully evaluate the different sum rules .",
    "this situation becomes more complicated for higher moments .",
    "but , these expectation values involve equal time expectation values for the nonequilibrium situation , and static expectation values for the equilibrium case , so they are simpler and more accurate to calculate than the spectral functions themselves .",
    "for example , we illustrate how to approximately determine them for the mott - insulating phase with a strong - coupling perturbation - theory expansion .    in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model and describe the techniques used to solve for the spectral moment sum rules and we develop the sum rules for the moments of the green s functions and self - energies .",
    "we also discuss the equilibrium homogeneous case , and present the moments as functions of momentum .",
    "numerical results comparing to different approximations for the spectral functions are performed in sec .",
    "iii along with a strong - coupling expansion for the expectation values needed to determine the values of the moments .",

    "similarly , the intersite hopping matrix @xmath3 can be time - dependent , such as in the case where there is an external electromagnetic field with arbitrary time - dependence described by a vector potential @xmath4 , and the bosons are charged , or in the case of cold atoms where the atoms move in a synthetic ( abelian ) gauge field given by such a vector potential  @xcite . in this case",

    "for example , it can describe bosons on an optical lattice that have the optical lattice potential modulated at some frequency , and thereby modifying the hopping , chemical potential and interaction as functions of time ( as is done , for example , in modulation spectroscopy  @xcite ) ; in this case , the local chemical potential would be described by the total chemical potential minus the local trapping potential at each lattice site .",
    "it can describe bosons on an optical lattice that have the trap either oscillated or impulsed to create dipole oscillations .",
    "it can also be used to describe a disordered bose glass system ( for a fixed distribution of local chemical potentials which represent the global chemical potential minus the diagonal on - site disorder ) .",

    "the expressions for the retarded self - energy moments can be obtained by using the dyson equation , which connects the retarded green s function and self - energy @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the noninteracting green s function ( in the case @xmath36 ) , and @xmath37 is the retarded self - energy . the first step is to rewrite eq .",

    "( [ gmu])-([sigmamu ] ) can be obtained by using the following spectral identities ( valid for all retarded functions that decay rapidly enough for large relative time ) : @xmath47 @xmath48 at large @xmath46 the green s function and self - energy must be real , or the spectral moments would diverge .",
    "the self - energy expansion in the last equation contains a frequency - independent term @xmath49 , which corresponds to the constant ( hartree - fock ) term in the self - energy .",
    "then , one inserts these expansions into eq .",
    "( [ dysonnonequilibrium2 ] ) and considers separately all terms which have the same order in @xmath50 .",
    "hence , it is necessary to expand all the functions under the integrals in powers of @xmath50 .",
    "this leads the following equations which connect the green s functions and self - energy spectral moments : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 we have suppressed the average time dependence of all of the spectral moments to save space .    from these equations ,",

    "we believe the answer to this lies in the inset in fig .",

    "the qmc and density matrix renormalization group results are cut off at lower frequencies , so they do not have this extra feature .",
    "this feature becomes increasingly important for higher moments , since the integrands are weighted more and also for even moments , since it can modify the cancellation that occurs between the positive and negative branches of the density of states . in this sense , the moment sum rules can be a very delicate test of the accuracy of the different numerical calculations .",
    "in addition , the vca , being based on a strong - coupling approach , is more accurate for large @xmath55 .",
    "we would expect other techniques to become more accurate as we move closer to the critical point and beyond .    we also want to test the spectral moment sum rules of the self - energy . here",
    "we have to now further process the data , as one can not compute the self - energy solely from the density of states or the momentum - dependent spectral functions .",
    "instead , we use a kramers - kronig relation on the spectral functions to determine the momentum - dependent retarded green s functions ( the imaginary part is just @xmath107 times the spectral function ) .",

    "once we have the imaginary part of the self - energy , we simply integrate it times the appropriate power of frequency to see the sum rule .",

    "the qmc results , on the other hand , do show the right trends , but have a much larger quantitative error to the moments .",
    "-1.0 in    .",
    "the parameters are @xmath109 and @xmath110 , with energies measured in units of @xmath55 .",
    "we compare the exact result ( black ) to the variational cluster approach ( red line ) , and to the quantum monte carlo plus maximum entropy approach ( purple ) .",

    "we compare the exact result ( black ) to the variational cluster approach ( red line ) , and to the quantum monte carlo plus maximum entropy approach ( purple ) .",
    "deviations are visible for all approximations indicating the self - energy is not determined as accurately here.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we continue with plots of the zeroth and first moments of the self - energy in fig .  [",
    "fig : moment_se2 ] . here , we must go through the inversion procedure described above to extract the self - energy from the data for the green s function .",
    "hence , for the vca , we must broaden the delta functions to create a smooth functional form for the green s function .",
    "we do this with a narrow broadening parameter to try to preserve the accuracy .",
    "this gives rise to the amplitude of the oscillations in the moment data due to oscillations in the green s function and then in the self - energy .",
    "once again , we do see the right trends in the data , but here the accuracy is fairly poor , especially for the qmc data .",
    "the vca data tends to have the right average behavior , but it s quantitative average is incorrect . by looking at the traces of the self - energy itself ,",
    "there are likely two reasons for the discrepancy .",
    "the first , is that the frequency cutoff might be too low , and the second is that the self - energy seems to have regions of frequency where it has strong frequency dependence , and this might not be properly captured by the approximations .",
    "in this work , we have derived exact formulas for the first few spectral moments of the bose - hubbard model through third order for the retarded green s function and through first order for the retarded self - energy .",
    "the results we derive are quite general , holding for inhomogeneous systems and for systems that have time dependence to the parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "sum rules can be quite useful in benchmarking different approximations , because their results are exact .",
    "one challenge with the work here , is that for the bosonic case , the moments depend on correlation functions that must be determined for the interacting system , unlike in the fermionic version , where many of the correlation functions become trivial to evaluate .",
    "but , in the limit of strong coupling , for the mott phase , these moments can be systematically found in a strong - coupling expansion , which appears to be quite accurate when compared to qmc results .",
    "we concluded this work with numerical calculations for translationally invariant systems in equilibrium , where we could benchmark the accuracy of different numerical results . because we did this in the strong - coupling region",
    ", it comes as no surprise that the vca turned out to be the most accurate approach , indicating that it is faithfully producing the moments of the spectral functions .",
    "it is much more difficult for us to determine the point - wise accuracy of the spectral functions , though .",
    "we did see that the numerical calculations appear to work best in one - dimension , where the moment sum rules are most accurate .",
    "we hope that this work will be used by others for benchmarking purposes of numerics and possibly for understanding qualitative changes in spectra as parameters change due to the constraints given by the sum rules .",
    "as nonequilibrium techniques are developed for interacting bosonic systems , it will also be interesting to use these results for benchmarking of those calculations , since exact results for nonequilibrium systems are quite rare .",

    "<S> we derive expressions for the zeroth and the first three spectral moment sum rules for the retarded green s function and for the zeroth and the first spectral moment sum rules for the retarded self - energy of the inhomogeneous bose - hubbard model in nonequilibrium , when the local on - site repulsion and the chemical potential are time - dependent , and in the presence of an external time - dependent electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate these moments for equilibrium , where all time dependence and external fields vanish . unlike similar sum rules for the fermi - hubbard model , in the bose - hubbard model case </S>",
    "<S> , the sum rules often depend on expectation values that can not be determined simply from parameters in the hamiltonian like the interaction strength and chemical potential , but require knowledge of equal time many - body expectation values from some other source . </S>",
    "<S> we show how one can approximately evaluate these expectation values for the mott - insulating phase in a systematic strong - coupling expansion in powers of the hopping divided by the interaction . </S>",
