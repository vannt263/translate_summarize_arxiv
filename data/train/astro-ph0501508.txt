    "global properties of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) , such as luminosities , colours , radii , line indices and velocity dispersions , are tightly correlated , implying that stellar population as well as dynamical / structural properties of these systems vary smoothly as a function of their mass .",
    "one of the most well known of such correlations is the fundamental plane ( fp ) , which is usually expressed as a relation among the effective parameters of etgs , i.e. the effective ( half - light ) radius and the mean surface brightness within that radius , and the central velocity dispersion @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the main characteristics of the fp are its small intrinsic dispersion , in the range of @xmath11@xmath12  dex ( @xmath13 ) in @xmath14 @xcite , and its tilt , i.e. the deviation of its slopes from those predicted for a virialized family of homologous systems with constant mass - to - light ratios  @xcite .",
    "several works have studied the fp to @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . however , due to the high demand of observing time for the measurement of velocity dispersions , these studies have been based only on small samples of galaxies . for this reason , different efforts have been made to construct correlations among purely photometric parameters of etgs , such as the mean surface brightness ( or the luminosity)size relation , also known as the kormendy relation @xcite , and the size  profile shape relation @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of these relations is that their intrinsic dispersion is significantly larger with respect to that of the fp . since biases on fitting coefficients",
    "become larger as the dispersion of observed correlations increases , selection effects are a crucial issue for the study of purely photometric correlations of etgs .",
    "another interesting correlation among global properties of etgs is the so - called photometric plane ( hereafter php , see @xcite , gra02 , and references therein ) , that is the correlation among radius , surface brightness and sersic index ( shape parameter ) of etgs . as shown by gra02",
    ", the php could have an intrinsic scatter which is comparable or slightly larger than that of the fp , therefore making this relation an interesting tool to measure galaxy distances and to analyze the properties of galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "to date , however , a detailed analysis of the use of the php for studying samples of distant galaxies has not been done .",
    "* hereafter lmb04 ) firstly attempted to derive the php for etgs in a cluster at @xmath16 , finding that a php relation seems to exist also at this redshift .",
    "the other few existing works on the php have only analyzed samples of galaxies at @xmath7 . moreover ,",
    "a straight comparison of results of these works can not be done , since they have derived the php in different wavebands , by using structural parameters defined in different ways , and for differently selected samples of galaxies .",
    "@xcite derived the @xmath2-band php for etgs in the coma cluster and in nearby groups using the central surface brightness , @xmath17 , the logarithm of the effective radius , , and the logarithm of the sersic index , .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( hereafter lgm99 and mlc00 respectively ) studied the optical php of etgs in clusters at @xmath18 using @xmath17 , the inverse of the sersic index , @xmath19 , and the scale  length of the sersic law ( see eq .  7 of lng00 ) .",
    "all these studies found that the php is actually a surface , etgs populating a curved manifold in the space of structural parameters . on the other hand",
    ", gra02 derived the php in the @xmath20 band for virgo and fornax etgs , finding that etgs follow a linear relation among , and .",
    "as noticed by gra02 , since the sersic law fit may not always provide realistic values of the central surface brightness , especially for galaxies with high values , the use of should generally be preferred to 0 .",
    "we note that this problem becomes even more important at high redshift , where , due to seeing effects , the measurement of 0 can require a large extrapolation of the light profile .",
    "a possible explanation for the existence of a correlation among structural parameters of etgs has been suggested by lgm99 , mlc00 and  ( * ? ? ? * hereafter mlc01 ) . using spherical , non - rotating , one - component models of etgs",
    ", these works argued that the php relation origins from a relation between the mass of etgs and their specific entropy .",
    "mlc00 showed that the entropy - mass relation is consistent with that expected in a dissipation  less merging scheme of galaxy evolution , where merging produces a higher level of disorder ( entropy ) in larger galaxies .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that the phps of dwarf and normal ellipticals appear to be offset in a direction of larger entropy for normal galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the php and processes such as dissipation  less merging makes it even more interesting to analyze this relation at different redshifts .",
    "if etgs were mostly assembled at @xmath21 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , one would expect that at lower redshift the slopes of the php do not change significantly with @xmath22 , while its zero - point varies accordingly to the fading of stellar populations .",
    "just as for the fp , this would imply that the zero - point of the php could be used to measure the formation epoch of stellar populations in etgs and , perhaps , cosmological parameters .",
    "since at different redshifts structural parameters are derived in different restframe bands , the evolution with @xmath22 of the php can only be addressed on the basis of an accurate knowledge of the wavelength dependence of this relation . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of the php on waveband carries interesting information by itself , depending on how the ratio of structural parameters between different wavebands varies along the galaxy sequence .",
    "this variation indicates how internal colour gradients of etgs depend on mass , which is an important discriminant of galaxy formation scenarios  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we derive the php in optical and nir wavebands for a large sample of etgs belonging to the cluster of galaxies clg 1008 - 1224 , also known as ms1008 - 1224 ( hereafter 1008 ) , a rich x - ray bright cluster at @xmath23  @xcite , originally detected in the einstein medium sensitivity survey  @xcite .",
    "for this cluster , a unique wealth of multi - wavelength data is available from the eso archive  , including very deep @xmath24 photometry taken with vlt fors and isaac and ntt sofi instruments in excellent seeing conditions .",

    "this unique data - set allows us to perform for the first time a homogeneous and accurate multi - wavelength analysis of the php at intermediate redshifts . in the present paper we study ( i ) the characteristics of the php relation ( i.e. its coefficients , scatter and shape ) at @xmath6 , accounting for selection effects as well as for the fitting procedure ; ( ii ) the waveband dependence of the php ; and ( iii ) the variation of the php coefficients from @xmath6 to @xmath7",
    "we consider the following representation of the php : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the slopes and @xmath28 is the zero - point of the relation .",

    "a steepening of colour gradients with galaxy luminosity is a natural expectation of the monolithic collapse model @xcite of galaxy formation , since galactic winds blow earlier in less massive galaxies , preventing gas dissipation to carry heavy metals in the center , and producing , therefore , a less steep gradient in these systems . on the other hand , in a hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation , merging would dilute stellar population gradients in larger galaxies @xcite , sweeping out or reversing the colour gradient - luminosity relation . the implications deriving from a multiwavelength analysis of the kr and the php should be carefully taken into account by any model aimed to explain the processes underlying the formation and evolution of etgs .",
    "since the php is a correlation among global parameters of etgs which are strictly related both to their luminosity density ( ) and internal structure ( and ) , its slopes indicate how these properties vary along the galaxy sequence .",
    "the fact that the php slopes do not change significantly up to @xmath180 implies that in this redshift range ( i ) the luminosity evolution of ( bright ) etgs is not significantly different along the galaxy sequence and ( ii ) correlations among structural properties and galaxy mass do not change significantly with @xmath22 .",
    "point ( i ) follows directly from the php equation ( eq .  [ phpeq ] ) .",
    "if the evolution with @xmath22 of would depend on and/or , we would expect to find a change of @xmath26 and @xmath27 with redshift ( see eq .",
    "[ phpeq ] ) . the fact that the luminosity evolution of ( bright ) etgs does not change along the galaxy sequence is consistent with results of kormendy relation studies at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) , which found that the luminosity evolution of etgs is almost independent of galaxy size .",
    "point ( ii ) can be analyzed by considering eq .",
    "[ seeq2 ] .",
    "if the php origins from a correlation between specific entropy and galaxy mass , the slopes of the php are fully characterized by the slopes of the @xmath181 vs. @xmath150 and @xmath149 vs. @xmath150 relations .",
    "since fp studies seem to indicate that the @xmath181 vs. @xmath150 relation does not change significantly at @xmath182 ( @xcite ) , the result of section  [ phpz0 ] implies that the slope of the @xmath149 vs. @xmath150 relation does not change significantly with @xmath22 .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that merging is the physical process which builds up the @xmath149@xmath150 relation ( mlc00 ) and that bright etgs in clusters are mostly assembled at redshift @xmath183 ( e.g. @xcite ) .    as shown in section  [ phpz0 ] , the zero - point of the php can be applied to constrain the mean luminosity evolution of etgs with redshift .",
    "this use of the php is based on the fact that its slopes do not evolve with redshift and that the variations with @xmath22 of the mean values of both and are known exactly ( see eq .",
    "[ deltac_1 ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath184 and @xmath185 , we find that the evolution of the zero - point of the php from @xmath97 to @xmath18 is consistent with the cosmological dimming of mean surface brightness and the passive fading of an old stellar population with a high formation redshift , @xmath186@xmath9 .",
    "the hypothesis @xmath187 is well motivated by the findings of different studies that the distribution of radii of etgs does not change significantly at intermediate redshifts @xcite . on the other hand , assuming @xmath188 is a more tricky point , since a morphology - density relation is known to exist and this relation evolves with redshift @xcite . to account for this effect , we calculated the mean values of for the sample of 1008 and that of gra02 .",

    ", it is clearly of great interest to have shown that the php is a valuable tool for measuring the luminosity evolution of etgs . in the future",
    ", it will be very interesting to derive the php for samples of galaxies at higher redshift , taking advantage ( a ) of the relatively small dispersion of the php with respect to other purely photometric correlations , and ( b ) of the fact that the php slopes seem not to depend on the waveband , allowing , therefore , a straightforward comparison of the php among different redshifts ( different restframe bands ) to be performed .",
    "using a unique dataset of optical and nir data , we have done a detailed study of the photometric plane ( php ) relation in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands for a large sample of etgs in the rich galaxy cluster 1008 at intermediate redshift ( @xmath97 ) .",
