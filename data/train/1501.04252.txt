    "asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes play an important role in understanding the dynamics and thermodynamics of holographic dual field theories via ads / cft duality @xcite . in particular ,",
    "these black holes are dual to thermal states of the ` boundary ' field theory .",
    "first order phase transitions in the bulk can be related to confinement / deconfinement - like phase transitions in the dual field theory @xcite . since scalar fields appear as moduli in string theory , it is important to understand the generic thermodynamic properties of hairy black holes .    motivated by these considerations , in this paper we study in detail the thermodynamics of a general class of exact @xmath0-dimensional neutral hairy black holes @xcite ( generalizations to other dimensions or for different horizon topologies can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the scalar potential is characterized by two parameters and the black hole solution has one integration constant that is related to its mass .",
    "for some particular values of the parameters in the potential , the solutions can be embedded in supergravity @xcite .",
    "the scalar field potential contains as special cases all the uncharged exact static solutions so far discussed in the literature @xcite ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "these static configurations have been extended to dynamical black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "there are some subtleties in defining the mass of a hairy black hole @xcite . in @xcite , a concrete method of computing the mass of an asymptotically ads",
    "hairy black hole was proposed .",
    "this method is very useful from a practical point of view because it is using just the expansions of the metric functions at the boundary .",
    "more importantly , it can be used for hairy black holes that preserve or not the conformal symmetry ( the ads isometries ) of the boundary .",
    "we are going to use this method , which is based on the hamiltonian formalism @xcite , to compute the mass of the black hole solutions .    however , based on the physics of ads / cft duality , a different method was developed , the so called ` holographic renormalization ' @xcite ( see , also , @xcite )  for boundary mixed conditions for the scalar field , this method was further developed in @xcite . the main idea behind this method",
    "is that , due to the holography , the infrared ( ir ) divergences that appear in the gravity side are equivalent with the ultraviolet divergencies of the dual field theory .",
    "then , to cure these divergencies , one needs to add counterterms that are local and depend on the intrinsic geometry of the boundary . in this way",
    ", one can use the quasilocal formalism of brown and york @xcite supplemented with these counterterms to compute the regularized euclidean action and the ` boundary ' stress tensor .",
    "the energy is the charge associated with the killing vector @xmath1 and it can be obtained from the boundary stress tensor .",
    "armed with these results , one can investigate the thermodynamics and phase diagram of the hairy black hole solutions .",
    "in particular , we show that there are first order phase transitions that lead to a discontinuity in the entropy .",
    "similar results were obtained for a general class of black holes solutions in a theory with a conformal invariant scalar field lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath2 , we review the exact hairy black hole solutions and briefly present some of their properties .",
    "section @xmath3 is dedicated to the computations of the thermodynamic quantities . to gain some intuition",
    ", we present a detailed computation of schwarzschild - ads ( sads ) black hole in the coordinates the hairy solution was written .",
    "then , to regularize the euclidean action ( and the boundary stress tensor ) , we propose a counterterm that depends on the scalar field and it is intrinsic to the boundary .",
    "the mass is computed with the counterterm formalism and , also , by the method of @xcite . in section @xmath0",
    ", we use the results in the previous section to investigate the existence of the phase transitions .",
    "then , section @xmath4 concludes with a summary of results .",

    "the potential and the solution are invariant under the transformation @xmath21 . for @xmath22 , which corresponds to the boundary",
    ", we can show that the theory has a standard ads vacuum @xmath23 . in the limit @xmath24",
    ", one gets @xmath25 and @xmath26 so that the sads black hole is smoothly obtained .",
    "the mass of the scalar field can be easily computed from the expansion of the potential and we obtain @xmath27 , which is the ` conformal ' mass .",
    "it is also important to point out that there are two distinct branches , one that corresponds to @xmath28 $ ] and the other one to @xmath29 $ ]  the boundary is at @xmath22 and the curvature singularities are at @xmath30 for the first branch and @xmath31 for the second one ( these are the locations where the scalar field is also blowing up ) .",
    "in this section we use the quasilocal formalism supplemented with counterterms to compute the euclidean action and hairy black hole s energy . for completeness",
    ", we also compute the mass with the method of @xcite that is based on the hamiltonian formalism @xcite .    as an warm - up example , let us start with sads black hole in the coordinates ( [ ansatz ] ) that can be obtained when the hair parameter is @xmath24 .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the gravitational counterterm @xcite is not sufficient to cancel the divergence in the action ( there is still a term proportional to @xmath57 ) but when we add the counterterm ( [ iphi ] ) we obtain a finite action : @xmath58 in the classical limit , the action is related to the thermodynamic potential ( the free energy @xmath59 in our case ) , which is @xmath60 . using the well known thermodynamic relations or by comparing the two formulas , one can extract the mass of the hairy black hole : @xmath61 since we have constructed the regularized action , we can use the quasilocal formalism of brown and york @xcite to construct the boundary stress tensor , which is the variation of the action with respect to the induced metric : @xmath62 the boundary metric can be locally written in adm - like form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the lapse function and the shift vector respectively and @xmath66 are the intrinsic coordinates on a ( closed ) hypersurface @xmath67 .",

    "one can easily check that the first law @xmath80 is satisfied .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the solutions fall into two distinct classes . for the the family with a positive scalar field",

    "the ads spacetime can be thought to have a potential wall as one approaches the asymptotic infinity and it behaves as an infinite box ( more rigorously , it has a conformal boundary ) . since it is not a globally hyperbolic spacetime the information can leak out or get in through the boundary and so , to obtain a well defined problem , one has to impose boundary conditions .",
    "the scalar field satisfies different boundary conditions depending on whether it is positive or negative , which corresponds to the two families of solutions mentioned before .",
    "a classical field theory is completely defined when the boundary conditions are prescribed . for any boundary conditions on the scalar field , the non - trivial vacuum configuration given by sads black hole solution should be included as an allowed state of the theory .",
    "hence , in the canonical ensemble , its free energy can be compared with the one of the hairy black hole at a given temperature .",
    "figure @xmath83 shows that , for the family with a positive scalar field , sads is always more favorable than the hairy configuration .",
    "figure @xmath84 shows the same phenomena for the family with a negative scalar field .",

    "the entire branch of smaller black holes ( for both families ) is unstable thermodynamically and has a positive free energy , while the large black holes branch are stable thermodynamically and the free energy goes negative for all @xmath88 . unlike the planar black holes for which do not exist first order phase transitions with respect to ads , the free energy is changing the sign .",
    "this is an indication that , for hairy black hole solutions with spherical horizon geometry , there are first order phase transitions with respect to thermal ads  the part of the branch of the large black holes that have a negative free energy with respect to ads are clearly the preferred ones .",
    "from the point of view of ads / cft duality , the study of the thermodynamics of asymptotically ads black holes is relevant to understanding the phase diagram of some holographic dual field theories .",
    "we have investigated the thermodynamics of a general class of hairy black holes with boundary conditions for a scalar field with the conformal mass @xmath89 , which preserve the ads isometries .",
    "it is worth remarking the close similarity that we have observed with the familiar structure of sads black hole .",
    "the large hairy black holes are thermodynamically stable , and the smaller ones have a negative specific heat .",
    "we have computed the euclidean action ( and so the thermodynamic potential ) by using the quasilocal formalism supplemented with counterterms .",
    "using these results , we have shown that there exist first order phase transitions between the thermal ads and hairy black hole .",
    "on the other hand , by comparing the free energy of the hairy black hole with the one for the sads solution , it seems that the sads black hole is always preferred .",
    "an interesting future direction is to check the existence of gravitational solitons as in @xcite and the implications for the phase diagram",
    ". it will be also interesting to study the phase diagram of the family of exact charged hairy black holes presented en @xcite . in this case , one can study both , the canonical and grand - canonical ensemble , respectively . in the canonical ensemble the charge , which is an extensive variable , should be kept fixed . since ads spacetime with a fixed charge",
    "is not a solution of the equations of motion , it is appropriate to compute the euclidean action with respect to the ground state that is the extremal black hole in this case @xcite . using similar arguments as in @xcite it was shown in @xcite that there exist extremal black holes with a finite horizon area and",
