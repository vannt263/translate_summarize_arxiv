    "adiabatic ( or static ) phonons have been discussed in the literature by many authors @xcite . they can be considered as a first step towards a full treatment of the electron - phonon interaction in a many - body system .",
    "the latter is plagued by a number of difficulties like the unrestricted number of phonons at each lattice site .",
    "these problems are partially avoided by the adiabatic limit , where the phonons are described by classical degrees of freedom .",
    "in general , the electron - phonon interaction can be successfully treated in a self - consistent perturbation theory , as long as the corresponding coupling is small .",
    "this approach is known as the migdal - eliashberg theory @xcite . at strong coupling , however , this theory experiences problems known as the breakdown of the migdal - eliashberg theory . in the case of the holstein model",
    "it was argued by benedetti and zeyher that this breakdown at large electron - phonon coupling is associated with the appearence of an effective double - well potential for the atomic positions @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that the appearence of a degeneracy in the atomic positions is a source of problems in a perturbative approach like that of migdal and eliashberg .",
    "the aim of this work is to discuss the physics of anharmonic adiabatic phonons with two degenerate maxima of the distribution at each lattice site in terms of a simple model .",
    "we ignore the electronic spin which is of no interest in our study and concentrate only on the scattering of spinless fermions .",
    "our discussion includes the derivation of an effective ising - spin model , where the spins represent the degenerate maxima of the distribution , and the application of the dynamical mean - field theory , which corresponds with the infinite - dimensional limit of the model .",
    "our anharmonic model can also be considered as the strong - coupling regime of the adiabatic holstein model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model is discussed in section 2 and an effective distribution of the adiabatic phonons is derived in section 3 . in the limit of discrete phonon degrees of freedom ( correlated binary alloy ) this is related to a distribution of ising spins ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "the latter is studied in the weak- ( section 4.1 ) and strong - coupling ( section 4.2 ) limits . in section 5",
    "we apply the dynamical mean - field approach to our model .",
    "finally , the results of the two approaches are discussed in section 6 .",
    "the holstein - like model with spinless fermions coupled to adiabatic anharmonic phonons is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath0 and the thermal phonon distribution @xmath1 at inverse temperature @xmath2 : h_f = -|t_r , rc_r^c_r - _ r(-g x_r)c_r^c_r  , p_0(x_r ) .",
    "[ hamilton ] @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are the fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operators and the real variable @xmath5 represents the phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter describes the displacements of the atoms at sites @xmath6 , assuming that it is thermally distributed according to @xmath1 .",
    "the fermions feel the displaced atom as a one - body potential @xmath7 . for harmonic phonons",
    "we have a gaussian distribution p_h(x_r)(-x_r^2 ) , [ harmon ] instead of @xmath1 , with @xmath8 as the position with maximal weight .",
    "the anharmonic distribution @xmath1 , on the other hand , has two degenerate positions with maximal weight , namely @xmath9 .",
    "the coupling to the fermions , however , can break this degeneracy , leading to homogeneous and inhomogeneous equilibrium distributions of the atomic positions on the lattice .",
    "although the model defined in equation ( [ hamilton ] ) looks like a model for anderson localization this is not a correct interpretation .",
    "the reason is that a model for anderson localization requires the averaging of the green s function with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "this is not the case for the adiabatic phonons : a grand - canonical ensemble of spinless fermions , coupled to adiabatic phonons , is defined by the partition function z = tr ^-h = _ f ^-h_f_rp_0(x_r)x_r [ part1 ] which represents an _ annealed _ average of the fermionic system .",
    "the fermionic green s function then reads in the temperature formalism @xmath10={1\\over z}\\int{\\rm tr}_{\\rm f}\\left [ \\rme^{-(\\beta - t ) h_{\\rm f}}c_r\\rme^{-th_{\\rm f}}c^\\dagger_{r ' } \\right]\\prod_rp_0(x_r)\\rmd x_r . \\label{green1}\\ ] ]    the anharmonicity is related to previous studies where an effective anharmonic ( double - well ) potential for the electrons was found @xcite . here",
    "the main idea is that the tunneling of the fermions is much faster than the motion of the atoms between the two maxima of the distribution .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the phonons is negligible and adiabatic phonons can serve as phononic degrees of freedom .",
    "the trace with respect to the fermions can be performed in equations ( [ part1 ] ) and ( [ green1 ] ) , since the fermions do not interact directly in the hamiltonian @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it gives the determinant of a @xmath11 matrix , averaged with respect to the distribution @xmath1 , such that the partition function reads @xcite @xmath12\\prod_r p_0(x_r)\\rmd x_r.\\ ] ] @xmath13 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath14 is the hopping matrix .",
    "the integrand of @xmath15 is a positive expression and can be considered as an effective distribution of the adiabatic phonons that replaces @xmath1 : p(\\ { x_r})=1z det_rp_0(x_r ) .",
    "[ distr1 ]      for the evaluation of the effective phonon distribution given in equation ( [ distr1 ] ) we consider the limiting case @xmath16",
    ". then the distribution @xmath1 selects @xmath17 where @xmath18 is formally an ising spin which describes discrete displacements of the atoms .",
    "this case can be considered as a correlated binary alloy ( cba ) , where the correlations are mediated by the fermions through the determinant in equation ( [ distr1 ] ) .",

    "[ distra ] it should be noticed that the cba distribution is not @xmath22 invariant , i.e. not invariant under a global flip of the spins or the coupling constant @xmath23 , in contrast to the distribution @xmath1 .",
    "the effective phonon distribution given in equation ( [ distra ] ) can describe different types of order of the displacements of the atoms , depending on the inverse temperature @xmath2 . at high temperatures we expect a paramagnetic ( disordered ) distribution , and at low temperatures some kind of order .",
    "some insight can be obtained by evaluating the distribution in the asymptotic regimes of weak as well as strong coupling .",
    "more details of the calculations are given in appendix a. for further simplification of the results we restrict our interest to the low - temperature regime , i.e. to @xmath24 .",
    "the weak - coupling limit is obtained from an expansion for small values of @xmath23 . according to appendix a the regime describes an uncorrelated binary alloy with the distribution p_w(\\ { s_r})=_r ^-ghs_r _",
    "s_r=1 ^ -ghs_r , [ weakc ] h=(+(k))^dk(2)^d , where @xmath25 is the dispersion of the tunneling term @xmath14 .",

    "this favors the atomic position @xmath28 : @xmath29 for a low fermion density ( i.e. for @xmath30 ) there is no magnetic field ( @xmath31 )",
    ". then the ising spins are paramagnetic ( disordered without correlations ) .",

    "the antiferromagnetic spin - spin interaction leads to a first order phase transition between ferro- and antiferromagnetic states , at least for low temperatures .",
    "a simple mean - field approximation reveals that the ising groundstate is an antiferromagnet for @xmath38 and a ferromagnet for @xmath39 .",
    "finally , for @xmath40 there is always a ferromagnetic state with @xmath41 .",
    "these three phases are shown in the low - temperature @xmath42 phase diagram in figure [ phase ] .",
    "the spectral density of the itinerant fermions can be evaluated conveniently by the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , originally developed for the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the dmft is the infinite - dimensional limit of the system .",
    "this limit is characterized by a simplified scattering process in comparison with the situation in a finite - dimensional system : the scattering of the _ same _ pair of fermions is very unlikely due to the large phase space . in the case of our adiabatic phonon system",
    "it is very unlikely that a fermion scatters with the _ same _ phonon more than once .",
    "this enables us to consider only the effective scattering on a single site .",
    "a consequence is that the effective correlation between the phonons , discussed in the weak- and strong - coupling regime , is excluded in the dmft @xcite .",
    "formally , the green s function reads g_n=[int2 ] with the matsubara frequency @xmath43 and the density of states @xmath44 of free fermions on the lattice .",

    "@xmath44 the integral in equation ( [ int2 ] ) can be evaluated explicitly .",

    "our results are shown in figure [ dos ] .",
    "the phase diagram of our model is complex and has been studied by two different mean - field approaches , a classical one for the ising - spin representation ( i.e. the cba ) and the dmft .",
    "it consists of para- , ferro- and antiferromagnetic phases in terms of the ising spins ( cf . equation ( [ strongc ] ) ) .",
    "the latter correspond to displacement configurations of the adiabatic phonons : disordered phonons ( or phonon liquid ) , homogeneous and alternating ( charge - ordered ) phases .",
    "there are phase transitions between these phases .",
    "according to our mean - field calculations , a first - order transition appears between the metallic homogeneous and the insulating alternating phase .",
    "the transition between the disordered and insulating alternating phase is second order .",
    "the disordered phase is most likely also insulating due to anderson localization of the fermions .",
    "the weak - coupling behavior of equation ( [ weakc ] ) indicates a disordered phase for @xmath58 and a homogeneous phase for @xmath59 .",
    "these results are summarized in the qualitative phase diagram of figure [ phase ] .",
    "our dmft results do not agree very well with the picture obtained from the cba .",
    "this might be a consequence of the fact that the dmft is a local approach , at least in the version discussed in this paper @xcite .",
    "there is a critical coupling @xmath60 that indicates the opening of a gap for @xmath61 . in our model",
    "@xmath60 changes with @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "figure [ dmftphase ] ) .",
    "large positive values for @xmath62 imply @xmath64 for hopping rate @xmath65 . decreasing @xmath62 results in a reduced value of @xmath60 .",
    "the lower the temperature the lower the value of @xmath60 .",
    "lower temperatures favour the insulating phase",
    ".    the gap opening at @xmath60 can not be directly linked with a characteristic change of the ordering of the adiabatic phonons , at least not in the regime of strong coupling and/or high temperatures .",
    "the anharmonicity plays a crucial role here because it can open a gap of width @xmath66 already in the absence of tunneling .",
    "this can be compared with the situation of harmonic phonons : in equation ( [ hamilton ] ) we replace the distribution @xmath1 by the harmonic distribution in ( [ harmon ] ) and study the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the treatment of the determinant of equation ( [ distr1 ] ) in strong coupling does not depend on the type of the random variable @xmath5 .",
    "thus we obtain the distribution for @xmath5 as given in equation ( [ strongc ] ) , except for an extra factor @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast to the distribution of the ising spins , this distribution has only disordered or homogeneously ordered phases for @xmath5 but no staggered order , implying the absence of a gap .",
    "it remains an open question whether or not the gap opening and the order of the adiabatic anharmonic phonons are related in general . this can be compared with the metal - insulator transition of the hubbard model inside a paramagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "it might be that the gap opening in both cases does not require any additional change of order in the models .",
    "a common feature of these models is the appearence of two eigenstates which are separated by the interaction energy if electronic tunneling is absent .",
    "this is fundamental also for the gap formation in the system with electronic tunneling .",
    "such a separation of electronic state does not exist for adiabatic _ harmonic _ phonons .",
    "a remaining puzzle is that the strong - coupling result in equation ( [ strongc ] ) is an antiferromagnetic ising model that provides a metallic homogeneous or a gapped alternating phase , whereas the dmft result indicates only a gap in the disordered phase",
    ".    experimental relevance of our results can be linked to the complex structures observed in manganites and related materials @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the interesting properties of these materials ( like the colossal magnetoresistance , or cmr ) are caused by a frozen mixture of ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic ( or charge - ordered ) insulating clusters .",
    "the typical size of these clusters is of the order of ten to hundred nanometers .",
    "this has been understood as electronic phase separation due to the proximity to a first order phase transition .",
