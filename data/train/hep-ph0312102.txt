    "the forward scattering of spacelike virtual photons ( with virtuality @xmath2 ) on the nucleon , allows one to study sum rules which relate nucleon structure quantities to inclusive electroproduction cross sections . at large @xmath2 , it yields the sum rules studied in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the study of such sum rules as function of @xmath2 from the real photon point to large @xmath2 , opens up the perspective to interpolate between the non - perturbative and perturbative regimes of qcd , as one goes from low to high @xmath2 .",
    "the moment @xmath0 of the nucleon spin structure functions can be measured by scattering longitudinally polarized electron beams off nucleon targets with transverse and longitudinal polarizations .",
    "being a higher moment in the bjorken variable @xmath7 , @xmath0 contains appreciable contributions from the resonance region .",
    "it is therefore the aim of this letter to study the threshold and resonance contributions to @xmath0 within the frameworks of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) and of a unitary isobar model ( maid ) .",
    "since a measurement of @xmath0 requires also transverse polarization , experimental information on this observable has become available only recently at slac  @xcite and jlab  @xcite .",
    "further experiments are underway or proposed at jlab  [ mez03 ] . in particular , the slac experiments @xcite yielded the values  : @xmath8 and @xmath9 at @xmath10  gev@xmath11 . at large momentum transfers , a non - zero value for @xmath0 directly measures a twist-3 quark - gluon matrix element in the nucleon , which has been estimated within several model calculations as well as within lattice qcd . in this paper , we show that when generalizing the definition of @xmath0 to arbitrary momentum transfers , its physical interpretation can be expressed in terms of generalized ( i.e. @xmath2 dependent ) spin polarizabilities of the nucleon . these generalized polarizabilities appear in the analysis of the forward virtual compton scattering amplitude ( for a review ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using the calculation of these spin polarizabilities within hbchpt  @xcite",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and within a unitary isobar model  @xcite , we evaluate @xmath0 . in an analogous way",
    ", the third moment of the spin structure function @xmath4 can be expressed through these spin polarizabilities .",
    "these generalized definitions for @xmath0 and the third moment of @xmath4 constitute useful observables to interpolate between a hadronic description at low @xmath2 and a partonic description , based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) at large @xmath2 . besides the twist-3 matrix element @xmath0 , the @xmath6 suppressed term in the twist expansion of the first moment of @xmath4 also contains the twist-4 matrix element @xmath5 .",
    "it has been suggested ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) that the matrix elements @xmath0 and @xmath5 enter in the response of the color electric and magnetic fields to the polarization of the nucleon in its rest frame , which can be expressed in terms of gluon field polarizabilities",
    ". therefore an extraction of @xmath5 , besides @xmath0 , can yield us interesting new nucleon structure information .",

    ", we review the twist expansion of the moments of the nucleon spin structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath1 and show how the definitions for the third moments of the nucleon structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath1 can be generalized at arbitrary @xmath2 in terms of nucleon spin polarizabilities . in section  [ sec3 ] , we use the calculation of these spin polarizabilities within hbchpt to evaluate @xmath0 and the third moments of @xmath4 and @xmath1 . in section  [ sec4 ] , we show how these observables can be expressed in multipoles which arise naturally when performing an evaluation within an isobar model . in section  [ sec5 ] , we show our results for @xmath0 and the third moments of @xmath4 and @xmath1 within both chpt and a unitary isobar model and compare with recent experimental data for @xmath0 .",
    "we also compare our results for the first moment of @xmath4 with the available data for both proton and neutron and use the twist - expansion for the first moment of @xmath4 to extract the magnitude of the twist-4 matrix element @xmath5 .",
