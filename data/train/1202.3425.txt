    "electromagnetic waves in a material medium propagate according to maxwell s equations complemented by certain relations linking strengths and induced fields  the constitutive relations . depending on the dielectric properties of the medium and also on the presence of applied external fields , a variety of optical effects can be found .",
    "one of wide interest is the birefringence @xcite , occurring when electromagnetic waves propagate in media exhibiting two distinct refractive indexes @xcite in a same wave vector direction .",
    "this effect occurs naturally in some well  known crystalline solids , as quartz and sapphire for instance . in nonlinear media , where the dielectric coefficients are field dependent , birefringence could also be induced by the presence of external fields , leading to the known kerr , cotton  mouton and magnetoelectric effects @xcite .",
    "birefringence has been widely used in technology of optical devices @xcite and as a powerful experimental technique for investigating properties of physical systems , including biological @xcite and astrophysical ones @xcite , among others .",
    "the phenomenon of triple refraction has been much less investigated . by trirefringence in a given wave vector direction , we mean the existence of three distinct refractive indexes in that direction . in the realm of linear electrodynamics",
    ", trirefringence does not occur @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , nothing was studied when the dielectric tensors are field dependent ( nonlinear electrodynamics ) .",
    "multirefringent properties have been measured in tailored photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "such materials are constructed to manipulate light propagation and hence can lead to a variety of applications @xcite .",
    "however , in these media , structural details ( lattice constants , defects , etc ) are imperative and hence they can not be described in terms of effective dielectric tensors @xcite .",
    "developments in photonic band gap materials and the so - called metamaterials have enabled the discovery of several new phenomena @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was experimentally shown @xcite that nearly transparent isotropic metamaterials allow light propagation when both effective dielectric coefficients ( permittivity and permeability ) are negative .",
    "in fact , this phenomenon and other unusual properties displayed by isotropic media with negative dielectric coefficients were long ago proposed theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing these media must be dispersive and the negative coefficients are obtained for convenient frequency ranges . some other unusual properties exhibited by specific metamaterials are negative refractive index @xcite , trapping of light @xcite , perfect lens devices @xcite , the electromagnetic cloaking effect @xcite and the occurrence of asymmetry for propagation of light in opposite wave vector directions @xcite .",
    "wave propagation in indefinite metamaterials ( where not all the principal components of the dielectric tensors have the same sign ) has been also considered @xcite , showing that effects already proposed in the context of isotropic metamaterials can be obtained and possibly improved .",
    "indefinite metamaterials can also be used for investigating certain aspects of general relativity @xcite .    in this paper , we show that nonlinear metamaterials described in terms of effective dielectric tensors , may display trirefringence .",
    "analytical expressions describing this effect are formally obtained from maxwell s electromagnetism and a simple theoretical model is numerically examined .",
    "a possible experimental realization of the media expected to display this effect is also addressed .",
    "the vectorial three dimensional formalism @xcite is used .",
    "the units are set such that @xmath0 . in the next section electromagnetic wave propagation in nonlinear materials",
    "is examined .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is stated and formally solved for a class of nonlinear materials presenting non - isotropic but constant permittivity tensor ( for a given frequency ) and isotropic permeability dependent on the modulus of the resultant electric field . in sec .",
    "iii , trirefringence phenomenon is theoretically described and proposed to occur in nearly transparent nonlinear uniaxial metamaterials . the analysis is performed in terms of phase and group velocities .",
    "final remarks and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the electrodynamics of a continuum medium at rest in the absence of sources is governed by the maxwell field equations @xmath1 taken together with the constitutive relations between the fundamental fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the induced ones @xmath4 and @xmath5 , written here as @xmath6 the dielectric coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the components of the permittivity and the inverse permeability tensors , respectively , and they encompass all information about the electromagnetic properties of the medium .",
    "further , for any vector @xmath9 we denote its @xmath10th component by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the propagation of monochromatic electromagnetic waves is here examined within the limit of geometrical optics @xcite using the method of field disturbances @xcite .",
    "this method can be summarized as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 , defined by @xmath14 , be a smooth ( differentiable of class @xmath15 ) hypersurface .",
    "the function @xmath16 is understood to be a real - valued smooth function of the coordinates ( @xmath17 ) and regular in a neighborhood @xmath18 of @xmath13 .",
    "the spacetime is divided by @xmath13 into two disjoint regions @xmath19 , for which @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "the discontinuity of an arbitrary function @xmath23 ( supposed to be a smooth function in the interior of @xmath24 ) on @xmath13 is a smooth function in @xmath18 , and is given by @xcite @xmath25_{\\sigma } \\doteq \\lim_{\\{p^\\pm\\}\\rightarrow p } \\left[f(p^+ ) - f(p^-)\\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath26 and @xmath27 belonging to @xmath28 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the electromagnetic fields are supposed to be smooth functions in the interior of @xmath21 and @xmath19 and continuous across @xmath13 ( @xmath16 is now taken as the eikonal @xcite of the wave ) .",

    "@xcite . )    for the cases of interest in this work , the permittivity of the media under study will be described by real diagonal tensors ( losses have been neglected ) whose components @xmath7 are dependent only upon the constant frequency of the wave .",
    "we set the magnetic permeability of these media to be real functions of the modulus of the electric field , such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "thus , applying the boundary conditions stated by eqs .",
    "( [ q1]-[q2 ] ) to the field equations ( [ 1a]-[1b ] ) we obtain the eigenvalue equation @xcite @xmath36 where the fresnel matrix @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40    non - trivial solutions for the eigenvalue problem in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) can be found if , and only if , @xmath41 , which is known as the generalized fresnel equation .",
    "this equation gives also the dispersion relations of the media under study . using the covariant formulae for the traces of linear operators @xcite the fresnel equation can be cast as @xmath42 where we defined the traces @xmath43 as a requirement of the geometrical optics limit , the wave fields are considered to be negligible when compared with the external fields .",
    "thus , we assume from now on that the fields are approximated by their external counterparts @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we set @xmath46 and @xmath47 which could be arbitrary functions of space and time coordinates .",
    "let us examine the particular case of uniaxial media @xcite with permittivity @xmath48 using eqs .",

    ". then , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "notice that when the propagation occurs in the @xmath57-plane ( spanned by the external electric and magnetic fields ) , the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 are null and the generalized fresnel equation reduces to a quadratic equation in @xmath60 , therefore allowing only birefringence .",
    "the same behavior occurs if @xmath61 .",
    "in fact in this situation we recover linear electrodynamics .    solving eq .",
    "( [ 40 ] ) we obtain @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 the solution @xmath65 does not depend on direction of the wave propagation and will be called the ordinary wave , whereas @xmath66 depend on direction of wave propagation and will be called extraordinary waves @xcite . by definition ,",
    "the velocities of the waves are given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ 75]-[76 ] ) . in order to achieve more simplicity in the following analysis",
    "we assume the external fields to be constant and set the wave vector in a given direction of the @xmath69-plane , i.e. , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ". in this notation @xmath73 indicates the angle between @xmath74 and the @xmath75 direction .",
    "two distinct solutions for @xmath76 in a same given direction @xmath74 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 76 ] ) if @xmath77 thus , taking into account the ordinary wave , eq .",
    "( [ 84 ] ) defines a region inside which trirefringence occurs in any chosen direction @xmath74 .",
    "let us examine this effect closer .",
    "in order to guarantee the existence of an ordinary wave we must set @xmath78 , otherwise @xmath65 is not real .",
    "this is true when both coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 present the same sign , which can be positive for usual media or negative for left handed materials ( in this case a negative refractive index occurs @xcite ) .",
    "let us set these coefficients to be positive .",
    "now , in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ 84 ] ) we set @xmath81 .",
    "hence , trirefringence occurs in directions determined by @xmath82 the above discussed phenomenon is displayed in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) where the normal surfaces @xcite associated with the ordinary and extraordinary waves are depicted for some specific values of the quantities appearing in eq .",
    "( [ angles ] ) . for",
    "any given direction encompassed by the angles between the two dashed straight lines , defined by eq .",
    "( [ angles ] ) , there are three distinct solutions : the dashed and dot - dashed curves representing the extraordinary waves , and the circular solid curve representing the ordinary wave . for angles between the dashed and the solid straight lines only birefringence occurs , and finally only one refraction occurs for directions encompassed by the angles between the two solid straight lines .",
    "it is also worth noticing from fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) that in the sectors where more then one refractive index occur , the medium under consideration behaves as a positive or negative medium @xcite , depending on sub - sectors and extraordinary waves .    in geometrical optics",
    "the directions of light rays are given by the directions of the group velocities @xmath83 which are considered as the physical velocities of propagation of the rays @xcite .",
    "as we see from eq .",
    "( [ 76 ] ) , the extraordinary waves depend on the wave vector .",
    "thus , the directions of the extraordinary light rays do not in general coincide with the directions of the extraordinary phase velocities , as explicitly shown by eq .",
    "( [ groupvs ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath84 into the definition of the group velocity we obtain that the ordinary group velocity is identified with the ordinary phase velocity @xmath85 .",
    "nevertheless , the extraordinary group velocities are given by @xmath86 with @xmath87 and where we defined @xmath88    in these equations @xmath89 represents the extraordinary wave velocities in the direction @xmath74 , which can be obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by taking the distances from the associated points on its wave vector surfaces to the origin of the coordinate system . for the particular model set in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the corresponding ray surfaces @xcite are depicted in fig .",

    "( [ group]-[groupz ] ) show that @xmath92 leads to superluminal group velocity solutions .",
    "therefore , this assumption is not in disagreement with the so - called causality requirement @xcite . for the ordinary waves we have @xmath94 , as anticipated . for the extraordinary waves",

    "[ fig2 ] , we see that there is a sector inside which there exist two extraordinary rays in any chosen direction of observation . for the complementary sector",
    "there are none extraordinary rays .",
    "we point out that any chosen direction for the rays inside the trirefringent sector is related to two different extraordinary wave vectors in fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "similarly , for any given wave vector inside the two dashed straight lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , there are two different extraordinary rays associated with it in fig [ fig2 ] . for instance , let us take the wave vector in the direction @xmath96 , as indicated by the arrow drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as is clear , in this direction there are three solutions for the phase velocity , indicating that trirefringence occurs .",
    "these solutions are represented by the points on the @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 curves , found in this particular direction , and their moduli are @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively . from eqs .",

    "[ fig2 ] , where the dashed and dot - dashed arrows correspond to @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "if the principal permittivity components are also dependent upon the modulus of the electric field , then analogous calculations leading to the equations for the phase and group velocities and conditions for having trirefringence derived in this paper will still hold by identifying @xmath108 and @xmath109    once we work in the regime of high frequencies ( required by geometrical optics ) losses must be assumed to be low @xcite .",
    "metamaterials with low - losses are still a matter of current investigations @xcite , with some achievements already obtained in such regime @xcite . in what concerns",
    "the role played by the nonlinearities eqs .",
    "( [ 76]-[76ib ] ) show us that if they exist ( i.e. @xmath110 ) , irrespective of their strengths , then they will lead to the presence of two extraordinary waves ( hence allowing trirefringence ) .",
    "given the physical quantities appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ group]-[groupz ] ) , the thresholds for the strengths of the nonlinearities are such that causality is not violated . the important quantity related to the nonlinearities",

    "layered media @xcite seem good candidates for experimental realizations of our assumptions .",
    "consider a system constituted by a repetition of two thin low - loss layers .",
    "one of them is composed by a nonmagnetic ( @xmath112 ) and dispersive ( @xmath113 ) medium .",
    "the other one is composed of a liquid medium whose permeability and permittivity are dependent upon the modulus of the resultant electric field as @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are usually much smaller than unity @xcite . additionally , if convenient external fields and layer parameters are present , then it is always possible to guarantee that our constraints are fulfilled .",
    "refraction analyzes were disregarded in our work once they are just a straightforward extension of the analyzes valid for birefringent crystals @xcite .",
