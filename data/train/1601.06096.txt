    "let @xmath5 be a connected , nonorientable surface of genus @xmath1 with @xmath6 boundary components and @xmath7 punctures , that is a surface obtained from a connected sum of @xmath1 projective planes @xmath0 by removing @xmath6 open disks and specifying the set @xmath8 of @xmath7 distinguished points in the interior of @xmath0 .",

    ", we identify a homeomorphism with its isotopy class .    in the orientable case ,",
    "the mapping class group @xmath14 is generated by dehn twists @xcite .",
    "as for nonorientable surfaces , lickorish proved that dehn twists alone do not generate @xmath3 , @xmath2 .",
    "this group is generated by dehn twists and one crosscap slide ( @xmath4homeomorphism )  @xcite .",
    "a presentation for @xmath3 using these generators was obtained by stukow @xcite .",
    "this presentation was derived from the presentation given by paris and szepietowski @xcite , which used as generators dehn twists and yet another homeomorphisms of nonorientable surfaces , so  called crosscap transpositions .",
    "margalit and schleimer discovered a surprising property of dehn twists : in the mapping class group of a closed , connected , orientable surface @xmath15 of genus @xmath2 , every dehn twist has a nontrivial root @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask if crosscap slides and crosscap transpositions also have a similar property .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to prove the following :    in @xmath3 a nontrivial root of a crosscap transposition [ or a crosscap slide ] exists if and only if @xmath16 or @xmath17 and the complement of the support of this crosscap transposition [ or crosscap slide ] is orientable .",
    "let @xmath18 be a nonorientable surface of genus @xmath2 .",

    "a regular neighborhood of @xmath22 is homeomorphic to the klein bottle with a hole denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "a convenient model of @xmath23 is a disk with 2 crosscaps , see figure [ uy ] . in this figure",
    "shaded disks represent crosscaps , thus the boundary points of these disks are identified by the antipodal map .        a _ crosscap transposition _ @xmath24 specified by @xmath20 and @xmath19 is a homeomorphism of @xmath23 which interchanges two crosscaps keeping the boundary of @xmath23 fixed @xcite .",
    "it may be extended by the identity to a homeomorphism of @xmath21 .",

    "crosscap slide _ of @xmath20 along @xmath19 , that is the effect of pushing @xmath20 once along @xmath19 keeping the boundary of @xmath23 fixed .",

    "if @xmath1 is even , then the complement of @xmath23 in @xmath28 can be either a nonorientable surface @xmath29 or an orientable surface @xmath30 , therefore on surfaces of even genus two conjugacy classes of crosscap slides and crosscap transpositions exist .",

    "a full presentation for @xmath3 is given in @xcite . among others ,",
    "the following relations hold in @xmath3 :    * @xmath39 for @xmath40 , * @xmath41 for @xmath42 , * @xmath43 , * @xmath44 and hence @xmath45 for @xmath46    it is straightforward to check that relations ( r1)(r3 ) imply    * @xmath47    geometrically @xmath48 is a cyclic rotation of @xmath31 and @xmath49 is a cyclic rotation of @xmath50 around @xmath51 . in particular ,    * @xmath52 in @xmath53 .",
    "we also have the following chain relation between dehn twists ( proposition 4.12 of @xcite ) : if @xmath54 is even and @xmath55 is a chain of simple closed curves in a surface @xmath56 , such that the boundary of a closed regular neighborhood of their union is isotopic to @xmath57 , then    * @xmath58 .",
    "[ rem : odd ] automorphisms of @xmath59 induced by crosscap transpositions and crosscap slides have determinants equal to @xmath60 , so if a root of a crosscap slide or a crosscap transposition exists , it must be of odd degree .",
    "let @xmath23 be a subsurface of @xmath28 that is a klein bottle with one boundary component @xmath61 and which contains @xmath51 and @xmath62 ( figure [ fig_surface ] ) .",
    "in particular @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath65 be such that @xmath66 . by relations ( r6 ) and ( r1 ) , @xmath67 analogously , by relations ( r6 ) , ( r1 ) and ( r4 ) , @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath65 be such that @xmath71 . by relations ( r6 ) and ( r1 ) , @xmath72 analogously , by relations ( r6 ) , ( r1 ) and ( r4 ) , @xmath73 .",
    "suppose now that crosscap transposition @xmath75 and crosscap slide @xmath76 are supported in a klein bottle with a hole @xmath23 such that @xmath77 is orientable . if @xmath78 is a chain of two  sided circles in @xmath77 , then by relation ( r7 ) , @xmath79 analogously , @xmath80 .",
    "crosscap slides and a crosscap transpositions are primitive in @xmath82 because @xcite @xmath83      [ rem : order6 ] it is known that the mapping class group @xmath85 is hyperelliptic @xcite and has the central element @xmath86 such that @xmath87 is the extended mapping class group @xmath88 of a sphere with 4 punctures .",
    "two upper subscripts mean that we have four punctures on the sphere , but one of them must be fixed .",
    "this implies @xcite that the maximal finite order of an element in @xmath88 is 3 , and hence the maximal finite order of an element in @xmath85 is 6 .",
    "moreover , each two rotations of order 3 in @xmath88 are conjugate , which easily implies that each two elements of order 6 in @xmath85 are conjugate .",
    "the details of the proof of the last statement are completely analogous to that used in @xcite , hence we skip them .    the same conclusion can be obtained also purely algebraically : it is known @xcite that @xmath89 and the maximal finite order of an element in @xmath90 is 6 .",
    "moreover , there is only one conjugacy class of such elements in @xmath90  for details see for example theorem 2 of @xcite .",
    "we will show that crosscap transpositions do not have nontrivial roots in @xmath85 .",
    "suppose that @xmath91 exists such that @xmath92 , where @xmath93 ( see remark [ rem : odd ] ) .",
    "then @xmath94 by remark [ rem : order6 ] , @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , by relation ( r7 ) , @xmath96 hence @xmath97 is conjugate to @xmath98 .",
    "this contradicts remark [ rem : odd ] , because dehn twists induce automorphisms of @xmath99 with determinant equal to 1 and @xmath100 .    in the case of a crosscap slide",
    "the argument is completely analogous , hence we skip the details .",
    "if @xmath103 is nonorientable , then @xmath61 cuts @xmath104 into two klein bottles with one boundary component : @xmath23 and @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , as was shown in appendix a of @xcite , @xmath106 if @xmath107 exists such that @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( see remark [ rem : odd ] ) , then @xmath108 in particular , @xmath97 commutes with @xmath109 and @xmath110 by proposition 4.6 of @xcite , up to isotopy of @xmath104 , @xmath111 . because @xmath112 does not interchange two sides of @xmath61 and does not reverse the orientation of @xmath61 , @xmath97 has exactly the same properties . therefore",
    ", we can assume that @xmath97 is composed of maps of @xmath23 and @xmath105 .",
    "moreover @xmath113 interchanges @xmath51 and @xmath62 and does not interchange @xmath114 and @xmath115 , hence @xmath116 but then @xmath117 which is a contradiction , because dehn twists about disjoint circles generate a free abelian group ( proposition 4.4 of @xcite ) .    in the case of a crosscap slide",
    "the argument is completely analogous , hence we skip the details .",
    "margalit and schleimer observed in @xcite that if @xmath118 , then roots of elementary braids in @xmath119 exist .",
    "the main theorem implies slightly stronger version of that result .      by proposition 2.4 of @xcite",
    ", there is a monomorphism @xmath123 which is induced by blowing up each puncture to a crosscap . in particular , this monomorphism sends elementary braids to crosscap transpositions .",
    "moreover , all roots of crosscap transpositions constructed in the proof of the main theorem are elements of @xmath124 ."
