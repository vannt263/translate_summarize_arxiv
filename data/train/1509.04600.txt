    "self guided filamentation @xcite of high - power femtosecond laser pulses results from a dynamic balance between the kerr effect which tends to self - focus the laser beam on one side , and the plasma created by the strong electric field , as well as higher - order polarisation saturation effects @xcite on the other .",
    "the resulting filaments can propagate beyond 100 m in the atmosphere @xcite , be created remotely @xcite , and withstand adverse atmospheric conditions like clouds @xcite or turbulence @xcite .",
    "this non - linear propagation regime is of particular interest for atmospheric applications @xcite such as remote sensing @xcite , triggering of high voltage discharges @xcite and lightning control @xcite .",
    "the most striking effect of laser filaments in the atmosphere is laser - induced condensation @xcite , where the plasma photochemistry induced by laser filaments leads to nucleation of new particles @xcite and their subsequent growth @xcite .",
    "both laboratory and field studies have shown that laser - induced condensation is partially associated with the production of locally high ozone and no@xmath0 concentrations in the gas phase .",
    "furthermore , ion chromatography of laser - produced particles sampled on filters has shown substantial amounts of no@xmath1 ions in the laser - condensed particles @xcite .",
    "the formation of highly hygroscopic hno@xmath2 has therefore been identified as one major pathway to support laser - induced condensation of aerosol mass , for relative humidity ( rh ) in atmosphere higher than 70% @xcite . moreover , ppb - range traces of atmospheric so@xmath3 have also been shown to increase laser - induced nucleation of new particles increasing the number concentration by typically one order of magnitude but without significant total aerosol mass increase .",
    "conversely , laboratory experiments in a cloud chamber showed that ppb - range concentrations of volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) lead to an increase in the concentration of laser - induced particles for sizes up to some hundreds nanometers , together with an increase of the condensed mass @xcite .",
    "this suggests that they both contribute at least to the initial phases of the nucleation but that mostly organic compounds condense on bigger particles .",
    "however , very little was known to date about the actual composition of the laser - induced aerosol mass , which is needed to identify the physico - chemical pathways .    here , we present a detailed chemical characterization of laser - induced aerosols in the real atmosphere .",
    "an aerosol mass spectrometer is used to investigate the influence of laser filamentation on ambient particle composition and size distributions .",
    "we show that condensation indeed occurs in the atmosphere under illumination by laser filaments , leading to an increase of the total aerosol mass and the appearance of a new size mode .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate the key contributions of ammonium nitrate ( rather than nitric acid , as previously expected ) , and to a lesser extent , of organics , to the laser - condensed mass .",
    "finally , we show that continuously spraying pre - existing water droplets into the laser beam strongly increases the oxidative properties of the laser - activated atmosphere , substantially enhancing the condensation of organics under laser illumination .",
    "the experimental setup is sketched in figure [ fig : experimentalsetup ] .",
    "the teramobile @xcite ti : sapphire laser delivers fourier limited , 180  mj and 80  fs pulses centered at 800  nm at a repetition rate of 10  hz . the pulses are loosely focused by an @xmath4  m telescope into the atmosphere . at the focus , the beam has a waist of around 5  mm ( hwhm ) and contains @xmath5 30 filaments of about 100 @xmath6 m in diameter each .",
    "the focal region is shielded from the wind by an open , galvanized iron tube of 30 cm diameter .",
    "the atmosphere is monitored in the filamenting region at 1  cm side distance from the laser beam by an aerodyne high - resolution time - of - flight aerosol mass spectrometer ( ams ) , an optical aerosol sizer , a nanoparticle sensor , and an ozone detector ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "additionally , temperature and rh were continuously monitored at the sampling location of these instruments . unless otherwise specified , the relative humidity was between 80  % and 100  % during the measurements .     ]",
    "each experiment consists of a series of 2 to 5 cycles of reference ( laser off ) and active ( laser on ) periods of about 15  minutes .",
    "the shielding tube is flushed with fresh air from the open atmosphere before each laser - on time period . besides the nominal conditions described above , we investigated the effect of spraying water droplets in the experimental region using a nebuliser .",
    "we aim at comparing the composition of the pre - existing atmospheric aerosols with those formed under the influence of the laser filaments .",
    "we therefore focused on steady - state situations , by averaging the measured size distributions and species concentrations over the active and reference periods .",
    "we corrected the measurement baseline for the slow drift of temperature and rh during the experiments . to avoid interference from the transient behaviours of both the instruments and the atmosphere just after starting or stopping the laser",
    ", we discarded the time interval of @xmath7  min at the beginning of each period .",
    "this ensures that the average over the remaining time period is stable within 3 standard deviations of the mean .",
    "when needed , the effect of the laser was assessed by performing a student test for the comparison of results from the active and reference periods .",
    "significance is considered achieved for confidence levels of 99% or beyond ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "]    the presence of the laser filaments results in a clear increase of the total aerosol mass concentration .",
    "as displayed in figure  [ fig : mass1](a ) , this increase reaches a factor of 14 in the case of the 25    300  nm particles ( @xmath580  nm median diameter ) .",
    "simultaneously , the concentration of particulate matter with an optical diameter of 250 nm to 1  @xmath6 m or 2.5 @xmath6 m ( pm1 and pm2.5 , respectively ) increases by almost 20% , while the ams measures a 40% increase of the total dry mass ( sum of sulfate , nitrate , organics , ammonium and chloride ) for aerodynamic diameters between 60 and 600  nm .",
    "such values are in line with previous measurements in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this rise is quite evenly spread over the size classes ranging from 300 to 600  nm , with a statistically significant increase of up to 25% for 300  nm particles ( figure [ fig : sizedistrib](a ) ) .",
    "is the vacuum aerodynamic diameter .",
    "stars denote size classes where the effect of the laser is statistically significant ( @xmath8 , see text for details ) .",
    "[ fig : sizedistrib ] ]     is the vacuum aerodynamic diameter .",
    "stars denote size classes where the effect of the laser is statistically significant ( @xmath8 , see text for details ) .",
    "[ fig : sizedistrib ] ]    by looking at the total mass detected by the ams ( sum of the nitrate , sulfate , organics , ammonium and chloride ) , one can see the appearance of a new mode ( aitken mode ) centered around 150  nm in the dry particle size distribution when the laser is turned on ( figure  [ fig : sizedistrib](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "this mode could be formed either by nucleation or by growth of nanometric pre - existing particles .",
    "simultaneously , the accumulation mode centered at 380  nm increases by 25% . also observed in the total mass size distribution . in spite of the smaller size of the smaller mode",
    ", both modes contribute about half of the total laser - induced mass condensation ( figure  [ fig : frac](c ) ) .      beyond the total particle mass and number concentration , the aerosol mass spectrometer allows identifying and quantifying the main components that substantially contribute to the laser - induced condensation .",
    "the condensed mass of no@xmath9 increases by a factor of 2.8 , nh@xmath10 by 60% , and organics by 20% ( figure  [ fig : mass1](b ) ) .",
    "considering their original mass fraction in the aerosols ( figure  [ fig : frac]a , right column ) , these components contribute 50% , 20% , and 28% of the net laser - induced increase of the dry mass ( figure [ fig : frac]c , right column ) .",
    "these contributions to the laser - condensed mass are comparable in both size modes .",
    "in contrast , no evidence for significant laser - induced so@xmath11 condensation is observed , consistent with the concentration of so@xmath3 in the atmosphere during the experiment of 2@xmath12 ( as measured by the geneva city air quality monitoring network @xcite ) .",
    "is the vacuum aerodynamic diameter .",
    "[ fig : frac ] ]      the ams allows detailed analysis of the organic aerosol composition .",
    "more specifically , oxygenated organic aerosol ( ooa ) can be described as highly oxygenated , low - volatility ( lv - ooa ) , and less oxygenated semi - volatile ooa ( sv - ooa ) @xcite . considering the mass to charge ( @xmath13 ) values of 44 ( corresponding in particular to @xmath14 ) and 43 ( mainly @xmath15 ) , as representative of these two categories respectively , we investigated their relative contributions , hereafter denoted @xmath16 and @xmath17 , to the total organic mass condensed in the aerosols .    during the experiment ,",
    "the laser condensed mass presents an @xmath16 and @xmath17 25% and 11% respectively lower than in the pre - existing atmospheric aerosol ( figure [ fig:44over43](a ) ) .",
    "this oxygenation state of the laser - condensed organic mass is similar to typical ambient ooa@xcite .",
    "=  44 , mainly @xmath14 ) and less oxygenated ( @xmath13  =  43 , mainly @xmath15 ) organics among the total organics , in particles detected during the reference period ( black ) and the laser - condensed particles , that is the difference of measurement with and without the laser ( red ) , for ( a ) the main experiment and ( b ) when spraying water in a low rh atmosphere ( b ) .",
    "the two black lines encompass the region where most atmospheric data are found to date@xcite .",
    "[ fig:44over43 ] ]    the laser produces highly oxidative conditions , with the generation of local concentrations of @xmath18 up to the 100  ppm range @xcite ( see also figure  [ fig : mass1 ] ) and ppbs of @xmath19oh radicals in the filaments @xcite .",
    "these conditions produce ooa with a composition on the boundary of lv - ooa and sv - ooa from the gaseous organics within a few seconds .      in an atmosphere with 50% rh ,",
    "the laser does nt condense any mass , and the ambient aerosol is mainly composed of organics ( 68% ) , so@xmath20 ( 19% ) , nh@xmath20 ( 8% ) and a small percentage of no@xmath21 ( 5% ) . continuously spraying water particles close to the laser focus caused the laser to condense mass ( as evidenced by a mass increase of 8% ) , mainly composed of organics ( 85% ) .",
    "furthermore , the oxygenation of the laser - condensed organics is higher than the pre - existing ones in this case , as evidenced by the increase of the highly oxygenated organics ( see @xmath16 in figure [ fig:44over43](b ) ) while the less oxygenated organics ( @xmath17 ) simultaneously decrease .",
    "the huge amount of @xmath22oh produced by the interaction of the water droplets with the laser filaments results in the production of lv - ooa , much more oxygenated than in the main experiment .",
    "conversely , no condensation of hygroscopic species occurs despite the huge amount of water sprayed , indicating that the latter is not available for laser - induced condensation .",
    "the formation of a new aitken mode accounting for 50% of the laser - condensed dry mass together with the increase of the pre - existing mode provides a clear evidence of the condensation induced by the laser filaments in the atmosphere , an effect that had only been characterised before in laboratory conditions  @xcite .",
    "the formation of new particles by nucleation or growth of pre - existing nanometric particles , as opposed to shattering of larger particles , is confirmed by the increase of the total mass of aerosol detected during the experiment , by the change of chemical composition of their dry mass and by the lower oxygenation level of the organics contained in the particles detected under laser illumination .",
    "the concentration of no@xmath2 and nh@xmath20 observed in the laser - induced aerosols ( 50% and almost 20% of the dry condensed mass , respectively , i.e. , a total contribution close to 70% ) sheds new light on the previously inferred binary water - hno@xmath2 condensation under laser illumination .",
    "the 0.31 mass ratio of @xmath23 to @xmath24 in the dry condensed mass ( figure [ fig : frac ] ) , in both the nucleation mode and accumulation modes , is consistent with that of @xmath25 .",
    "one can therefore expect that the hygroscopic hno@xmath21 previously identified to assist the condensation of water @xcite is not condensed , as initially expected , as nitric acid in a binary mixture with water , but rather as hygroscopic ammonium nitrate through the reaction @xcite    @xmath26    nh@xmath21 is typically available as background trace gas in the summer sub - urban atmosphere of the experiment location in amounts of several @xmath6g / m@xmath27  @xcite .",
    "this concentration is comparable with the laser - condensed mass of nh@xmath28 , suggesting that the laser - induced condensation relies on the condensation of pre - existing ammonia together with hno@xmath2 .",
    "the latter is generated via the interaction of no@xmath0 produced by the multi - photon ionisation of n@xmath3 with o@xmath21 @xcite or @xmath19oh radicals @xcite , both produced by the multiphoton absorption and photolysis of o@xmath3 .",
    "the very low efflorescence of ammonium nitrate and the high quantities of @xmath25 in the laser condensed mass suggest that there is always water in the laser induced aerosols .",
    "besides , it validates a posteriori the _ ad hoc _ introduction of ammonium nitrate for modelling the growth of laser - induced particles @xcite .      besides ammonium nitrate",
    ", the laser mainly condenses organics ( 28% of the dry mass ) . the amount of organics condensed by the laser seems to be driven by the ability of the laser to create an oxidative atmosphere . at normal atmospheric conditions and when rh is above 70% , the laser partly oxidises organics , resulting in the condensation of typical ambient lv / sv - ooa , slightly less oxygenated than the pre - existing organic aerosol during our experiment",
    "this suggests that new aerosol mass is formed by the laser from the semi - volatile organics available in the gas phase , and not from the already condensed non - volatile species . the absolute amount slightly below 1  @xmath6g / m@xmath27 of organics condensed by the laser constitutes a few percent of the total concentration of vocs available in a typical urban atmosphere @xcite , confirming the voc availability for laser - induced oxidation and condensation .",
    "when water is sprayed around the laser filaments at an original rh lower than 70% , the proportion of organics in the dry mass drastically increases ( 80% of the dry mass ) . given that no relative humidity change was observed when spraying water during this particular experiment , we attribute this effect to the interaction of the water droplets sprayed into the laser beam , with the laser filaments . considering their high concentration during the experiment ,",
    "about 100 water droplets interact with the laser filaments for each laser pulse .",
    "these water droplets then internally focus the incident laser light on a nanometric hot spot , where the extreme incident intensity ( in the 10@xmath29  tw/@xmath30 range ) will efficiently ionize water @xcite .",
    "this ionization produces a concentration of @xmath19oh radicals much higher than in normal atmospheric conditions , leading to efficient oxidization of the available organics .",
    "the resulting highly oxygenated , low volatility organics then efficiently condense onto particles with a high oxygenation state comparable to that of @xmath31-pinene particles after exposure to 500 ppb of o@xmath2 during 13 hours @xcite .",
    "this very fast oxidization illustrates again the extreme conditions locally produced by the laser filaments .",
    "our results evidence the dual role of organics in laser - induced condensation . while they had been shown to promote nucleation in a background - free atmosphere @xcite",
    ", we show that they also substantially contribute to the particle growth up to at least 600  nm in diameter ( see figure [ fig : frac ] ) .",
    "sulfuric acid is known to provide one of the main sources of condensation nuclei in the atmsophere @xcite . in the case of laser - induced nucleation ,",
    "experiments in a cloud chamber showed that sulfuric acid does not only drastically enhance the number density of nucleated particles , but also the total condensed mass @xcite .",
    "the very low mass fraction of sulfate ions in the laser - induced condensed mass ( @xmath32 2 % ) detected during our experiment can be explained by the low ambient so@xmath3 concentrations during the study . in this case , its role is restricted to the formation of small condensation nuclei , most probably together with oxidized organics @xcite .",
    "we simultaneously measured the size distribution and the quantitative size resolved aerosol composition by mass spectrometry during laser - induced condensation in the real atmosphere .",
    "we obtained direct evidence of laser - assisted condensation in real atmosphere , with a 40% increase of aerosol total mass and a 15-fold increase in the particle number concentration between 25 and 300  nm .",
    "furthermore , we observed the condensation of hygroscopic nh@xmath20no@xmath21 accounting for two thirds of the laser - condensed mass .",
    "this abundance shows that no@xmath2 condenses as ammonium nitrate , rather than as nitric acid as previously expected .",
    "the rest of the laser - condensed dry mass is mainly provided by organics , accounting for as much as 28% , evidencing their role in the particle growth .",
    "the presence of these two components ( ammonium nitrate and organics ) can be attributed to two main condensation mechanisms related to the production of nitrogen oxides , ozone and @xmath19oh radicals by the interaction of the filaments with the atmosphere .",
    "the first one consists of the generation of hno@xmath21 , which then condenses in a ternary system together with nh@xmath21 and water to form @xmath33 in the laser - induced particles .",
    "the second one is the oxidation of volatile organics by @xmath19oh radicals and o@xmath21 into less volatile organics which condense on the pre - existing particles .",
    "moreover , the oxidation as well as the degree of oxygenation of organics can be strongly increased by the presence of pre - existing water droplets because of increased @xmath19oh radical concentrations due to internal focusing of the laser light within the droplets .",
    "our work therefore offers a global picture of the complex mechanisms at play in laser - induced condensation .",
