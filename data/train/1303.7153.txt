    "vortex states in mesoscopic superconductors have been extensively studied in the past two decades , both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite two main interactions have been found to govern vortex behavior in a mesoscopic system .",
    "the first one is the vortex - vortex interaction , which causes vortices to form abrikosov triangular lattices in bulk type - ii superconductors .",
    "the second one is the interaction between vortices and sample boundaries , which makes vortex configurations strongly dependent on the size and geometry of mesoscopic samples - whose dimensions are of the order of the penetration depth @xmath3 or the coherence length @xmath4 . for example , in square mesoscopic samples , vortex configurations try to best match the @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "when there is only one vortex in the sample ( @xmath6 state where @xmath7 is the winding number or vorticity ) , the vortex always sits in the center of the sample in order to balance the boundary effect from all sides . for the @xmath8 state ,",
    "two vortices sit on the diagonal such that the vortex - vortex separation is maximal in order to minimize the intervortex interaction . a giant vortex with @xmath8",
    "can be induced when the boundary confinement pushes two single vortices together , as predicted theoretically@xcite and observed experimentally.@xcite for @xmath9 state , because of its incompatability with the four - fold symmetry , the theory predicts that the ground state corresponds to an anti - vortex sitting at the center surrounded by four vortices.@xcite in short , the symmetry of the sample largely determines the vortex configurations when the size of the superconductor is reduced .",
    "however , the properties of nanoscale superconductors , whose sizes are of the order of the fermi wavelength @xmath10 , are very different from those of mesoscopic superconductors .",
    "this is because the distance between electronic levels becomes comparable to the superconducting energy gap due to quantum confinement @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of cooper pairs is suppressed which leads to the quantum - size effect ( qse),@xcite quantum - size cascades,@xcite the shell effect@xcite and inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the order parameter.@xcite the latter is the most important for the present work because it is expected to strongly influence the vortex states in nanoscale superconductors .",
    "a similar behavior was shown for an isolated vortex core , where oscillations of there order parameter on the order of the fermi wavelength were predicted .",
    "@xcite    inhomogeneous superconductivity has been studied in various systems in the last decades and shows more complex behavior than homogeneous ones .",
    "it is known that vortices tend to migrate and get pinned in areas where superconductivity is suppressed.@xcite the reason is that it is more favorable energetically for a vortex to suppress the superconducting order parameter in a region where it has already been suppressed , although sometimes vortices can be pinned where the gap is large.@xcite some three - dimensional ( 3d ) samples can also be treated as inhomogeneous systems.@xcite for example for a 3d tip geometry , an asymmetric @xmath6 vortex state can be the ground state because the thick region prevents the vortex from penetrating it.@xcite in multi - layered superconductors , vortices enter first and reside favorably in the weak layers .",
    "then , vortices will penetrate into the strong layers only after weak layers become saturated and various vortex clusters and asymmetric vortex states are induced.@xcite also , the fabrication of anti - dots in superconductors results in a spatially varying superconducting energy gap with a barrier at the interfaces . in these systems , the combination of the giant vortex , multi - vortex and anti - vortex states can be found as ground state , which depends strongly on the detailed geometry of the antidots .",
    "@xcite    for conventional superconductors , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the fermi wave vector and @xmath13 is the bcs coherence length ) , systems of size comparable to @xmath10 will not be large enough to host a vortex ( being much smaller than the coherence length ) .",
    "however , materials with small coherence lengths , e.g. high - t@xmath14 cuprate superconductors , will have @xmath15 and therefore in such systems it is possible to obtain vortex states in the quantum confinement regime .",
    "another such system is a graphene flake deposited on top of a superconductor .",
    "because of the proximity effect , cooper pairs will diffuse in graphene@xcite . in graphene",
    "the scattering length is large , therefore such a system is in the clean limit .",
    "more importantly , near the dirac point , the fermi wavelength is very large and can be easily manipulated by doping . in other words ,",
    "@xmath16 can be tuned , which will allow for different vortex patterns to be realized in the graphene flake in the quantum confinement regime , but for more accessible sample sizes ( even above 100 nm ) .",
    "a similar configuration was also recently proposed by knopnin et .",
    "al in ref .",
    "yet another system where effects of quantum confinement on vortex matter can be probed systematically are the optically trapped cold gases @xcite , which are nowadays extremely controllable .    for studying such nanoscale systems , microscopic bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory is required .",
    "previous works used the bdg method to focus on isolated single vortex lines@xcite , giant vortices@xcite and to describe the local density of states modifications due to vortex - vortex and vortex - boundary interactions@xcite but are in the mesoscopic limit as opposed to the nanoscale limit considered here .",

    "we found unconventional vortex states in the quantum limit due to shape - induced resonances in the inhomogeneous cooper - pair condensate .",
    "vortex - antivortex structures , asymmetric vortex states and vortex clusters were found as ground states over a wide range of parameters .",
    "they are distinct from previous results obtained in mesoscopic superconductors using the gl theory . however , there are still several aspects that remained unclear . for example",
    ", how does the size of the sample affect the vortex states in nanoscale superconductors ?",
    "under which conditions , does one recover the conventional gl results ?",
    "why are the antivortex states more stable in the nanoscale limit while giant vortex states are unfavorable ?",
    "how do the vortex states change if temperature is increased ?    in order to answer these questions ,",
    "in this paper , we study vortex states in nanoscale superconducting squares systematically .",
    "vortex states for different sample sizes , @xmath0 parameters and temperatures @xmath17 are investigated and the stability of the symmetry - induced vortex / anti - vortex molecules is discussed .",
    "more unconventional states , very different from the ones obtained within gl theory , are found .",
    "this study is therefore fully complementary to what is known for vortex matter in superconductors .",

    "[ s201 ] contour plots of the order parameter @xmath69 and the corresponding diagonal profiles are shown for sample i - iii with different sizes .",

    "when compared with the gl theory@xcite , one of the differences is that the free energy of the normal state depends on the magnetic field while it is a constant in gl theory .",
    "the reason is that the energy levels of the confined electrons are different for different magnetic fields . in our case",
    ", the change of the energy is relatively small when compared with the energy gap ( energy difference between the normal state and the superconducting state ) especially in weak fields .",
    "although the shown energy curves look conventional , there are significant differences with the gl theory.@xcite    by sweeping the magnetic field up and down , we can get the full energy spectrum and the corresponding vortex states . for a certain magnetic field",
    ", it is common to have more than one converged solution .",
    "the lowest energy state is the ground state while the states with higher energy are referred to as metastable states . in fig .",
    "[ vcg ] , we show the contour plot of the absolute value of the order parameter of the corresponding ground states for various winding numbers .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fhall ] , the system favors states with winding numbers @xmath83 and @xmath84 because they have relatively large ground state flux range ( excluding the meissner state ) . from fig .",
    "[ vcg ] , we observe that these states have fourfold symmetry which is compatible with the sample geometry . one interesting feature of this system is the richness of metastable states .",
    "these states appear for all winding numbers @xmath7 except @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the number of metastable states reaches a peak for @xmath87 and equals @xmath88 . from the free energy curves , we notice that the energy difference between the ground state and the metastable states can sometimes be very small",
    "this makes the ground state difficult to find in simulations unless we sweep the field up and down many times .",
    "we also note that most metastable states are focused at lower magnetic fields from the corresponding ground state flux range .",
    "the reason is that vortices get easily stuck at the boundary due to the pronounced oscillations of the order parameter .",
    "for the same reason , their stability range is narrower due to asymmetry .",
    "the number of metastable states decreases for higher @xmath7 . in this case , the shorter distances between vortices cause strong interaction between them .",
    "this limits the choice of stable positions for vortices and therefore the number of metastable states are lower . due to this reason ,",
    "metastable states are less favorable for smaller samples because of easy saturation with vortices .",
    "for example , no metastable states were found in sample i with size @xmath58 .    .",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 are for flux @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "darkest areas indicate the positions of vortices .",
    "note that at the center an anti - vortex ( for @xmath93 ) or a giant vortex [ for @xmath94 can spontaneously form .",
    "note also that for some vorticities two different ground states are found ( at different magnetic fields ) . ]      next we discuss the ground states configurations for different vorticities in more detail . for the @xmath6 state , shown in fig .",
    "[ vcg ] , the vortex sits at the center of the sample which is compatible with the conventional picture .",
    "although such result is observed for different parameters of the sample , the state with diagonal location of the vortex can also be found in some cases.@xcite it is clear that the order parameter around the vortex core is suppressed and the profile shows the competition between @xmath5 symmetry and @xmath95 .",
    "it means that the vortex has long range ( longer than @xmath13 ) interaction with other objects such as the other vortices and/or boundaries .    by increasing the flux to @xmath96",
    ", the ground state shifts from @xmath6 to @xmath8 and two vortices sit along the diagonal .",
    "this again coincides with the result from gl theory , and results from the competition between the confinement imposed on vortices by the meissner currents and the vortex - vortex repulsion . in this case",
    ", these effects can be clearly seen from the profile of the order parameter , especially from the suppressed area around the vortices .",
    "the vortex - vortex interaction suppresses the order parameter mostly in the area between them .",
    "this can not be found in gl theory because the order parameter is always smooth and changes slowly in space .",
    "the state with @xmath9 shown in fig .",
    "[ vcg ] becomes the ground state when the fieldapplied flux is between @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it resembles the multi - vortex state obtained within gl theory where the three vortices are at the apices of a equilateral triangle .",
    "however , the perpendicular bisector of the triangle always coincides with one of the diagonals of the square sample in gl theory while it is parallel to one of the edges in our case .",
    "this is because the grid - like pattern in the inhomogeneity of the order parameter imposes preferential positions for the vortices inside the square .",
    "the state @xmath87 has a similar feature but the configuration is compatible with the gl result .    from these states",
    ", we conclude that when the gl vortex configuration , which minimizes the vortex - vortex and vortex - boundary interaction , matches the oscillation pattern due to quantum confinement , then the state has a wider flux stability range .",
    "two ground states , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , are found for @xmath101 in the flux ranges @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . both of them have a pentagonal vortex configuration .",
    "this is because the particular shape resonance at the considered field causes the order parameter to be peaked at the center .",
    "therefore , it costs energy for vortices to sit in the center of the sample .",
    "for the same reason , the ground states @xmath104 and @xmath105 do not have vortices in the center .",
    "moreover , when @xmath106 , vortices start to be compressed in the sample .",
    "if they do not form giant vortices , they will be very close to each other and form string - like structures [ see @xmath104 state ] .",
    "states with @xmath93 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 shown in the panels of fig .  [ vcg ] have a common feature , as all of them keep the fourfold symmetry .",
    "@xmath93 contains a antivortex at the center while @xmath108 and @xmath109 have a single vortex and a giant vortex with @xmath110 at the center , respectively .",
    "the state with @xmath93 is the only ground state which contains an antivortex .",
    "the antivortex is closely surrounded by four vortices and forms the core structure for @xmath93 .",
    "the outer shell is formed by the remaining four individual vortices sitting at four corners .",
    "states with @xmath107 and @xmath108 contain vortex dimers , i.e. two vortices close to each other at each corner .",
    "the fourfold symmetry makes both former states have a larger ground state flux range .",
    "@xmath109 also keeps the @xmath5 symmetry but the energy is sometimes even higher than the state @xmath89 , which has only @xmath111 symmetry .",
    "the reason is that the giant vortex costs extra energy .    in order to visualize the changes in the ground states",
    "when key parameters change , we plot the phase diagram for samples i - iii for @xmath112 and @xmath113 in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "different shadings of blocks in fig .",
    "[ phase ] indicate different vortex types .",
    "the plain white background represents conventional multi - vortex states as found within the gl theory , while the blue background with square grid represents giant vortices , also compatible with the result obtained from gl theory .",
    "asymmetric vortex states attained only by bdg theory are represented by yellow background with horizontal grid pattern .",
    "states containing parallel vortex chains , represented by orange background with vertical grid pattern , and part of the vortex - antivortex molecules represented by pink(grey ) background , are new compared to gl theory .",
    "we can conclude from fig .",
    "[ phase ] that the quantum size effect is important not only for the transition field and the stability range of the different vortex states , but also for the vortex configurations .",
    "the reason is that the oscillation patterns of the order parameter are very sensitive to @xmath0 and may cause totally different behaviors even for two samples of identical size .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ phase](a ) and ( b ) , the vortex phase transition fields vary greatly with sample size @xmath1 except for the phase boundary between @xmath85 and @xmath6 state .",
    "all the phase boundaries oscillate with @xmath1 .",
    "we find that some samples favor vortex states with even winding number @xmath7 while other disfavor them .",
    "for example , sample",
    "i with @xmath58 favors @xmath8 state whereas the one with @xmath114 disfavors @xmath87 to the point of non - existance .",
    "when @xmath1 becomes large , the transition fields start to converge and the flux stability range of each @xmath7 state will be roughly one flux quantum .",
    "when compared to samples i and ii , sample iii ( with large @xmath0 ) shows a more conventional picture .",
    "moreover , the phase transition field increases only slightly with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "it means that for large @xmath0 , the quantum size effect on the transition field , at least when winding number @xmath7 is small , can be neglected .",
    "nevertheless , a plethora of different vortex configurations is found .",
    "for example , an asymmetric @xmath6 state is found in all three samples .",
    "moreover , sample i always shows asymmetric states when @xmath115 .",
    "one other interesting phenomenon is that , for @xmath8 , sample ii can host all five types of vortex states with @xmath1 increasing .    from the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , we notice that nanoscale superconductors favor anti - vortices and disfavor giant vortices .",
    "for example , the giant vortex state appears for @xmath8 in sample ii with @xmath114 . based on gl theory",
    ", only smaller samples will exhibit a giant vortex configuration .",
    "however , when @xmath116 , the two individual vortices form an asymmetric vortex state . on the other hand , we find that the probability of forming anti - vortices is much higher than in gl theory . in gl case , antivortex states usually appear for @xmath9 when four vortices are at the four corners and surround a centered antivortex .",
    "usually the distance between vortices and the antivortex is small ( less than @xmath4 ) . in the bdg calculation , at least two more antivortex states can be found .",
    "one is still the @xmath9 state and the antivortex is still at the center but four vortices are at the edges instead of the corners .",
    "this configuration was first presented by us in ref .",
    "[ ] where we showed that the size of the vortex / anti - vortex(v - av ) molecule is larger than the one obtained with gl theory .",
    "the other antivortex state appears for @xmath8 . in this case , the four vortices still sit at four corners but the centered antivortex carries two flux quanta , e.g. it is a giant antivortex ! due to the strong vortex - antivortex interaction , the size of such v - av molecule is small .     in sample i with size @xmath117 ( top panel ) and the corresponding contour plots of the order parameter ( bottom panel ) .",

    "metastable states are important in the bdg formalism because the energy difference between the ground and the metastable states can be very small .",

    "in this section , we discuss the appearance and stability of anti - vortex states in the bdg theory in order to explain the existence of the giant antivortex .",
    "actually , such a state was already found in ref .",
    "@xcite through the linear gl method by introducing artificial pinning .    from the phase diagram shown in fig",
    ".  [ phase ] , we found that anti - vortex states are surprisingly stable within bdg theory .",
    "this is due to the fact that the grid pattern oscillation of the order parameter gives an additional contribution to the symmetry of the vortex states and therefore , in a square sample , the @xmath5 symmetry is enhanced .",
    "the other reason to form an anti - vortex is that the oscillations induced by the order parameter are seen in the vortex core where the order parameter is already suppressed .",
    "these oscillations can easily lead to a shift in the phase of the order parameter by @xmath164 and , thus , result in the formation of vortex - antivortex molecules .    in order to explain this ,",

    "when there are two roots , as shown in panel ( c ) , the configurations are multi - vortex states .",
    "similarly , the profiles of the order parameter shown in panels ( d ) and ( e ) from fig .  [ scheme1 ] for @xmath9 show a @xmath168 spatial dependence .",
    "one root means that we have a giant vortex state whereas three roots represent a vortex - antivortex configuration .",
    "note that , in order to generate the central anti - vortex , the order parameter has to oscillate around the center of the square .     but now for the bdg theory .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the symmetric and asymmetric @xmath6 vortex states , respectively .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) are the giant vortex and vortex - giant antivortex @xmath8 states , respectively .",
    "panels ( e ) and ( f ) are the giant vortex and vortex - antivortex @xmath9 configurations , respectively . ]     at @xmath169 with winding number @xmath170 .",

    "now let us move to nano - size superconductors where the bdg theory has to be used and the spatial oscillation of the order parameter can not be neglected . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ scheme2 ] the oscillation plays an important role in generating vortices , especially when the value of the order parameter is comparable to the amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "for instance , panels ( a ) and ( b ) from fig .",
    "[ scheme2 ] show the symmetric and the asymmetric @xmath6 vortex states .",
    "the reason for the appearance of the asymmetric vortex state is the fact that the order parameter has an odd number of oscillations across the diagonal .",
    "thus , the vortex can not sit at the center . for the @xmath8 states , panel ( c )",
    "shows a giant vortex state where the sign of the profile of the order parameter is always positive across the diagonal .",
    "however , due to the oscillations , the case shown in panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ scheme2 ] can easily exist and shows a giant anti - vortex ( @xmath50 ) at the center .",
    "further , the configurations show a large diversity for a fixed winding number @xmath7 . when @xmath8 , the configuration can be @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 and so on .",
    "panels ( e ) and ( f ) from fig .",
    "[ scheme2 ] are for @xmath9 states .",
    "apparently , they are similar to the gl case shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme1 ] , but the probability of the occurrence of the v - av state is much larger than in gl case .",
    "the reason is that the result with one root is just a special case while the general case shows oscillations at and around the vortex core .",
    "the v - av molecules do not only exist for smaller winding number @xmath7 , but they can also appear for large @xmath7 in the bdg results .",
    "[ scheme3 ] shows an example for sample iii with @xmath72=7 at @xmath169 and with a winding number @xmath170 .",
    "we find that vortices concentrate in the central dark ( blue ) area where the order parameter is strongly suppressed . from the phase of the order parameter , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme3](b ) , the total winding number @xmath170 is found but it is difficult to distinguish each vortex . after a careful analysis , we plot schematic diagram of the vortex configuration in fig .  [ scheme3](c ) .",
    "the dark(blue ) dots and open diamonds indicate vortices and anti - vortices , respectively . as can be seen , the lattices of vortices and antivortices are nested within each other . since anti - vortices attract vortices , all the vortices ( @xmath175 vortices and @xmath176 antivortices )",
    "can be condensed in the cental area of the sample .",
    "this picture becomes more accurate when @xmath0 is large .",
    "the stronger the oscillations of the order parameter the more v - av pairs are generated . however , the size of the v - av pair can only be of the order of the fermi wavelength .",
    "thus , it will be very hard to detect them in experiments .",
    "this is why these states are mostly treated as a giant vortex in conventional superconductors . in other words , the suppressed central area of the order parameter , after coarse graining , will look like a giant vortex with @xmath170 .",
    "to summarize , we investigated the vortex states in a nanoscale superconducting square for different sizes @xmath1 , parameters @xmath0 , and temperatures @xmath17 .",
    "first , we found that the inhomogeneous pattern of the order parameter in the absence of magnetic field strongly depends on @xmath0 and the size @xmath1 .",
    "this oscillation pattern will give an additional contribution to competing effects that determine the vortex configurations when the field is applied .",
    "due to the inhomogeneous order parameter induced by the quantum topological confinement , samples with different @xmath0 and @xmath1 will favor different winding numbers @xmath7 .",
    "we find unconventional vortex states such as asymmetric , edge - parallel and vortex - antivortex states as the ground state of our nanoscale system .",
    "these were never seen in the ginzburg - landau approach .",
    "the inhomogeneous pattern of the order parameter , especially the strong oscillation at the boundaries causes additional potential wells for vortices which in turn generates a lot of metastable vortex states .",
    "furthermore , in the quantum limit , nano - size superconductors favor vortex - antivortex molecules while disfavoring giant vortex states .",
    "we observe that vortex ground states and the phase transition fields are very sensitive to changes in the parameter @xmath0 , size @xmath1 and temperature @xmath17 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the quantum size effect .",
    "however , this effect is suppressed when the size @xmath1 is large or when temperature is high . in this case",
    "most metastable states become unstable and the ground states become compatible with gl theory .    for high magnetic fields ,",
    "vortex - antivortex pairs can be easily found when @xmath0 is large because the absolute value of the order parameter becomes smaller than the amplitude of its oscillations . however , detection of such states is beyond the current experimental abilities .",
    "the peculiar vortex states uncovered in the present work should be observable in superconducting systems where @xmath16 is small .",
    "such systems could be high-@xmath147 superconducting nano - grains for which the coherence length is small or cold - atom condensates with small @xmath12 , i.e. large fermi wavelength . of special interest",
    "could be hybrid systems made of superconducting substrates and graphene sheets for which the fermi wavelength is highly tunable near the dirac point .",
    "future work could also address the fundamental vortex - vortex and vortex - antivortex interactions for systems with a small @xmath16 , for which the oscillations of the order parameter on the order of @xmath10 become important .",
    "this work was supported by the flemish science foundation ( fwo - vlaanderen ) and methusalem funding of the flemish government .",

    "<S> bogoliubov - de gennes theory is used to investigate the effect of the size of a superconducting square on the vortex states in the quantum confinement regime . </S>",
    "<S> when the superconducting coherence length is comparable to the fermi wavelength , the shape resonances of the superconducting order parameter have strong influence on the vortex configuration . </S>",
    "<S> several unconventional vortex states , including asymmetric ones , giant multi - vortex combinations , and states comprising giant antivortex , were found as ground states and their stability was found to be very sensitive on the value of @xmath0 , the size of the sample @xmath1 , and the magnetic flux @xmath2 . by increasing the temperature and/or enlarging the size of the sample , quantum confinement is suppressed and the conventional mesoscopic vortex states as predicted by the ginzburg - laudau ( gl ) theory are recovered . however , </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the gl results we found that the states containing symmetry - induced vortex - antivortex pairs are stable over the whole temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the inhomogeneous order parameter induced by quantum confinement favors vortex - antivortex molecules , as well as giant vortices with a rich structure in the vortex core - unattainable in the gl domain . </S>"
