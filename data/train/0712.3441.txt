    "weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies provides a unique , direct way to study the mass distribution of galaxy clusters ( bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) via the systematic shape distortion of background galaxies ( tyson , wenk , & valdes 1990 ; kaiser & squires 1993 ; schneider & seitz 1996 ; umetsu , tada , & futamase 1999 ) and also to a lesser extent by the magnification of the background ( broadhurst , taylor , & peacock 1995 ; taylor et al .",
    "we have examined both these effects in our earlier work on a1689 ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2005a , hereafter b05a ) , where we found good consistency between the magnitude of the radial depletion of background red galaxies caused by lens magnification and the weak lensing distortion profile of the same background galaxy population , which we then combined to derive an improved mass profile .",
    "a limitation of the magnification technique is the intrinsic clustering of the background , which for red galaxies is mainly in the form of localized groups of modest angular size in the background field . in principle , with redshift information sharp overdensities can be isolated in redshift and down weighted , or with sufficiently large number of redshifts , the shift of the magnified luminosity function can be utilized independently of density fluctuations ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1995 ; zhang & pen 2005 ) .",
    "the combination of all lensing related effects is of course desirable , leading to the derivation of the highest precision feasible when constructing mass maps and density profiles .",
    "furthermore , because lensing effects depend on distance , the cosmological redshift distance relation may be constrained via the geometric scaling of the lensing signal with redshift ( e.g. , taylor et al .",
    "2007 ; medezinski et al . 2007 ) .",
    "advances in the quality of imaging encourage a closer examination of the empirical effects of lensing and the development of more comprehensive techniques to extract reliable high resolution information . from space ,",
    "deep multi - color images of massive clusters can be used to identify many sets of multiple images per cluster ( broadhurst et al .",

    "2006 ) . from the ground the stable prime - focus wide - field cameras of subaru and cfht are producing data of sufficient quality to examine weak lensing distortions over a wide range of radius .",
    "more recently , wide - field near ir cameras , such as moircs on subaru wircam on cfht , omega2000 on calar - alto and wfcam on ukirt , may help improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts for many faint galaxies . however , it is still the case that no set of deep high quality wide field images exists for any massive cluster with full optical - ir coverage , despite all the progress of field surveys .",
    "a further motivation for pursuing accurate lensing maps is the increased precision of model predictions for statistical properties of cluster - sized mass halos in the standard lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath5cdm ) model .",
    "many of the free parameters of this model now rest on a firm empirical foundation with relatively tight constraints on the index and normalization of the power spectrum of density perturbation and the background cosmological model ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; tegmark et al . 2004 ; spergel et al .",

    "context @xmath12-body simulations have become impressively comprehensive , in particular the recent millennium simulation ( springel et al . 2005 ) which simulates a huge volume of @xmath13 , and has been used to predict the mass function and evolution of nearly 100,000 group and cluster sized cdm halos . this model is tightly defined and hence amenable to comparisons with the real universe , particularly for the case of clusters where baryons , which are usually omitted from large scale simulation , are not expected to have a significant impact on the shape of gravitational potential of a cluster since the high temperature of the cluster gas prevents efficient cooling , and",
    "hence the majority of baryons simply trace the gravitational potential of the dominant dark matter .",
    "accurate @xmath12-body simulations based on the @xmath5cdm scenario predict a relatively shallow , low - concentration mass profile for massive cluster halos , where the logarithmic gradient flattens continuously toward the center of mass ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ) with a flatter central slope than a purely isothermal body interior to the inner characteristic radius , @xmath14 .",

    "this together with many multiple images identified in deep _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) imaging defined a detailed lensing based cluster mass profile out to the cluster virial radius ( @xmath26 mpc ) .",
    "the combined strong and weak lensing mass profile is well fitted by an nfw profile ( navarro et al .",

    "these results could raise serious questions regarding the basic assumptions behind the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "if clusters collapse earlier than predicted then it is expected that denser and hence more concentrated halos will develop in the context of cdm ( wechsler et al .",
    "2002 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it has been argued that part of this discrepancy from lensing observations could be reconciled by observational effects such as triaxiality of cdm halos ( oguri et al .",
    "2005 ; hennawi et al . 2007 ; sereno 2007 ; corless & king 2007 ) , and the projection of structure along the line of sight ( e.g. , king & corless 2007 ) , both of which boost the projected surface mass density and hence the lensing signal . such observational biases in the lensing - based concentration parameter have been explored in details by hennawi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) on the basis of @xmath12-body simulations , indicating a positive bias of @xmath30 in the halo concentration derived from 2d lensing measurements .",
    "although a1689 is a very round shaped cluster with evidence of only modest substructure ( teague , carter , & grey 1990 ; girardi et al .",
    "1997 ; andersson & madejski 2004 ; czoske 2004 ; b05b ) , such a chance alignment of structure could be a potential source of high concentrations .",
    "furthermore , for a reliable measurement of the cluster mass profile , systematic errors inherent in the lensing measurements , such as the uncertainty in the background redshift distribution and the dilution effect on the lensing signal due to contamination by cluster members ( b05a ; medezinski et al .",
    "2007 ) , need to be taken into account .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we derive mass profiles of a1689 from weak lensing data using three different methods , and compare resulting mass profiles ; we also combine our weak lensing mass profiles with strong lensing constraints from previous studies to test the cdm paradigm ; then , we assess carefully various sources of potential systematic error in the halo concentration parameter derived from the lensing observations .",

    "weak gravitational lensing is responsible for the weak shape - distortion and magnification of the images of background sources due to the gravitational field of intervening foreground clusters of galaxies and large scale structures in the universe .",

    "the lensing convergence is expressed as a line - of - sight projection of the matter density contrast out to the source plane ( @xmath50 ) weighted by certain combination @xmath51 of co - moving angular diameter distances ( e.g. , jain et al . 2000 ) , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the cosmic scale factor , @xmath54 is the co - moving distance ; @xmath55 is the surface mass density of matter , @xmath56 , with respect to the cosmic mean density @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the critical surface mass density for gravitational lensing , @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 being the angular diameter distances from the observer to the source , from the observer to the deflecting lens , and from the lens to the source , respectively . for a fixed background cosmology and a lens redshift @xmath63 , @xmath58 is a function of background source redshift @xmath64 . for a given mass distribution @xmath65",

    "a chance projection of foreground / background structure along the line - of - sight can potentially influences projected lensing observations , boosting the surface mass density locally and hence the concentration .",
    "the acs strong lensing analysis of b05b revealed the secondary mass clump in the central region of a1689 associated with a small clump of galaxies .",
    "the existence of this subclump has been suggested by earlier observations , such as the spectroscopic study of teague et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and czoske ( 2004 ) , and the x - ray study of andersson & madejski ( 2004 ) .",

    "however , the detailed acs strong lensing analyses based on multiply imaged background galaxies showed that the mass contribution of the secondary mass clump is only a small fraction of the main cluster component ( figures 21 and 22 of b05b ) , implying a lower @xmath693 for the subclump than for the main cluster , which is tightly constrained by the geometrical positions of sets of multiply lensed images , or the location of critical curves .    in the near future , the question of the effect of triaxiality on lensing based cluster mass profiles may be examined empirically .",
    "for example , the total x - ray luminosity or the total lensing based mass of a cluster should not depend on the orientation with respect to the line of sight , whereas the concentration parameter and the einstein radius will be affected and hence expanded lensing studies could in principle reveal whether relaxed clusters of fixed mass or fixed x - ray luminosity tend to have consistent lensing based concentrations , or instead a broader distribution may be uncovered , with a mean concentration smaller than derived for a1689 , indicating triaxiality produces a significant bias .",
    "current indications based on several massive clusters favor the nfw profile , but with consistent concentrations ( medezinski et al .",
