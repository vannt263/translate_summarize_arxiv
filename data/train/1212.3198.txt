    "the deconfinement phase transition in finite - temperature lattice gauge theories ( lgts ) has been one of the main subjects of investigation for the last three decades . by",
    "now it is well studied and understood for a number of pure gauge models in dimensions @xmath19 . in particular , the phase structure of a finite - temperature three - dimensional ( @xmath2 ) pure @xmath20 lgt with the standard wilson action is thoroughly investigated both for @xmath21 and for the large-@xmath22 limit ( see , _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite and references therein ) . the transition is second order for @xmath21 and first order for @xmath1 . in the case of the @xmath23 gauge group ,",
    "most works agree that the transition is weakly first order .",
    "the deconfining transition in @xmath24 lgts belongs to the universality class of @xmath25 @xmath26 potts models .",
    "all these phase transitions are characterized by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a @xmath0 global symmetry of the lattice action in the high - temperature deconfining phase .",
    "another interesting set of models is represented by abelian @xmath0 lgts .",
    "@xmath0 is the center subgroup of @xmath20 , hence @xmath0 lgt can provide useful insights into the universal properties of @xmath20 models .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 lgts are interesting on their own right and might possess an even richer phase structure as will be revealed below . the most general action for the @xmath0 lgt can be written as @xmath27 gauge fields are defined on links of the lattice and take on values @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath0 gauge models , similarly to their spin cousins , can generally be divided into two classes - the standard potts models and the vector models .",
    "the standard gauge potts model corresponds to the choice when all @xmath29 are equal .",
    "then , the sum over @xmath30 in  ( [ action_gauge ] ) reduces to a delta - function on the @xmath0 group .",
    "the conventional vector model corresponds to @xmath31 for all @xmath32 . for @xmath21",
    "the potts and vector models are equivalent .",
    "the study of the phase structure of @xmath0 lgts at zero temperature has a long history .",
    "while the phase structure of the general model defined by  ( [ action_gauge ] ) remains unknown , it is well established that the potts models and vector models with only @xmath33 non - vanishing have one phase transition from a confining phase to a phase with vanishing string tension  @xcite . via duality ,",
    "@xmath0 gauge models can be exactly related to @xmath2 @xmath0 spin models . in particular ,",
    "a potts gauge theory is mapped to a potts spin model , and such a relation allows to establish the order of the phase transition .",
    "hence , potts lgts with @xmath34 have second order phase transition , while for @xmath35 one finds a first order phase transition .",
    "vector models have been studied numerically in  @xcite up to @xmath36 .",
    "it was confirmed that the zero - temperature models possess a single phase transition which disappears in the limit @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the @xmath38 lgt has a single confined phase in agreement with theoretical results  @xcite .",
    "a scaling formula for the critical coupling with @xmath22 had also been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we are not aware , however , of any detailed study of the critical behavior of the vector models with @xmath1 in the vicinity of this single phase transition .",
    "the deconfinement phase transition at finite temperature is well understood and studied for @xmath21 .",
    "an especially detailed study was performed on the gauge ising model , @xmath34 , in  @xcite .",
    "these models belong to the universality class of @xmath25 @xmath0 spin models and exhibit a second order phase transition in agreement with the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture  @xcite .",
    "one should expect on general grounds that the gauge potts models possess a first order phase transition for all @xmath39 , similarly to @xmath25 potts models .",
    "the @xmath40 vector model has been simulated , _",
    "e.g. _ , in  @xcite .",
    "it also belongs to the universality class of the @xmath25 @xmath40 spin model and exhibits a second order transition .",
    "much less is known about the finite - temperature deconfinement transition for the vector @xmath0 lgts when @xmath1 .",
    "it is the ultimate goal of the present work to deepen our understanding of the phase structure of these models .",
    "the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture is known to connect critical properties of @xmath2 @xmath0 lgts at finite temperature with the corresponding properties of @xmath25 spin models , if they share the same global symmetry of the action .",
    "it is widely expected , and in many cases proved by either analytical or numerical methods , that some @xmath25 @xmath41 spin models ( like the vector potts model ) have two phase transitions of infinite order , known as the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transitions . according to the conjecture ,",
    "the phase transitions in some @xmath2 @xmath41 gauge models at finite temperature could exhibit two phase transitions as well .",
    "moreover , if the correlation length diverges when approaching the critical point , these transitions should be of the bkt type and belong to the universality class of the corresponding @xmath25 @xmath0 spin models .",
    "the bkt phase transition has been best studied in the @xmath25 @xmath42 model  @xcite .",
    "certain analytical  @xcite as well as numerical results  @xcite unambiguously indicate that the deconfining phase transition in the @xmath2 @xmath38 lgt is also of infinite order and might belong to the universality class of @xmath25 @xmath42 model   larger than its @xmath42 value by almost a factor of 2 for @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the question of the universality remains open for this model . ] .    in recent papers",
    "@xcite we have initiated exploring the phase structure of the vector @xmath0 lgt for @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , we have considered an anisotropic lattice in the limit where the spatial coupling vanishes . in this limit",
    "the spatial gauge fields can be exactly integrated out and one gets a @xmath25 generalized @xmath0 model .",
    "the polyakov loops play the role of @xmath0 spins in this model . for the villain version of the model",
    "obtained we have been able to present renormalization group arguments indicating the existence of two bkt - like phase transitions .",
    "this scenario was confirmed with the help of large - scale monte carlo simulations of the effective model .",
    "we have also computed some critical indices which appear to agree with the corresponding indices of @xmath25 @xmath0 spin models , thus giving further support to the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture .    in this paper",
    "we extend our analysis to the full isotropic @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt at finite temperature .",
    "it is well known that the full phase structure of a finite - temperature lgt is correctly reproduced in the limit where spatial plaquettes are neglected .",
    "they have probably small influence on the dynamics of the polyakov loop interaction .",
    "we therefore expect that the scenario advocated by us in  @xcite remains qualitatively correct for the full theory .",
    "in particular , full gauge models with @xmath1 should possess two phase transitions of the bkt type and we expect the values of critical indices to coincide with the indices of the @xmath25 vector spin models .    the @xmath25 @xmath0 spin model in the villain formulation has been studied analytically in refs .",
    "it was shown that the model has at least two phase transitions when @xmath44 .",
    "the intermediate phase is a massless phase with power - like decay of the correlation function .",
    "it turns out that @xmath45 at the transition point from the strong coupling high - temperature phase to the massless phase , _",
    "i.e. _ the behavior is similar to that of the @xmath42 model . at the transition point",
    "@xmath46 from the massless phase to the ordered low - temperature phase one has @xmath47 . a rigorous proof that the bkt phase transition does take place , and so that the massless phase exists , has been constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite for both villain and standard formulations of the vector model .",
    "universality properties of vector models were studied via monte carlo simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath48 and in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath49 .",
    "results for the critical indices @xmath50 and @xmath51 agree with analytical predictions obtained for the villain formulation of the model .    a similar phase structure is expected to hold for the finite - temperature @xmath2 @xmath41 lgt .",
    "it can be described in terms of the polyakov loop correlation functions as follows .",
    "the low - temperature phase is a confining phase . here",
    ", the correlation decays with an area law , thus implying a non - vanishing string tension and a linear potential between static @xmath0 charges . with the temperature increasing ,",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition to a massless phase .",
    "this phase is characterized by the enhancement of the @xmath0 global symmetry to a @xmath38 symmetry and is very close in nature to the high - temperature phase of @xmath38 gauge model . in particular , the dominating contribution to the correlation of the polyakov loops comes from massless excitations ( dual spin - waves ) .",
    "this is nevertheless a confinement phase , as the correlation decays with a power law and though the string tension vanishes , the potential between @xmath0 charges is logarithmic . increasing the temperature further on leads to a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath0 global symmetry at some critical point .",
    "one enters a deconfining phase above this critical point .",
    "here we intend to :    * check the scenario of two bkt phase transitions described above ; * compute some critical indices at both transitions and verify the universality class of the model .    the fact that the bkt transition has infinite order makes it hard to study its properties using analytical methods . in most of the cases",
    "studied so far one uses a renormalization group ( rg ) technique as in ref .",
    "@xcite . unfortunately , there are no direct ways to generalize the transformations of ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to rg equations , to @xmath2 @xmath0 lgts , except for the limiting case @xmath37 . to study the phase structure of these models",
    "we need numerical simulations . here",
    ", however , another problem appears related to the very slow , logarithmic convergence to the thermodynamic limit in the vicinity of the bkt transition .",
    "it is thus necessary to use both large - scale simulations and combine them with the finite - size scaling methods .",
    "our principal strategy consists in passing to a dual formulation of the @xmath2 @xmath0 vector lgt , which is known to be a generalized @xmath2 @xmath0 vector model .",
    "this allows us to use a cluster algorithm in our simulations . the standard procedure in studying the phase structure is to use binder cumulants to locate the position of critical points .",
    "then , critical indices can be determined from various susceptibilities . in the case of a deconfinement phase transition",
    "both binder cumulants and susceptibilities are usually constructed from polyakov loops .",
    "however , it is a non - trivial problem to write down the expression for a single polyakov loop in a dual formulation ( though the dual form can be easily found for invariant quantities , like the correlation of polyakov loops ) .",
    "we have therefore decided to study the critical behavior making use of binder cumulants and susceptibilities constructed from the dual @xmath0 spins  .",
    "this procedure exhibits an interesting phenomenon , namely the critical behavior of dual spins is reversed with respect to the critical behavior of polyakov loops : the spontaneously - broken ordered phase is mapped to the symmetric phase and _",
    "vice versa_. moreover , the critical indices @xmath50 are also interchanged as will be explained later on .",
    "the index @xmath51 which governs the exponential divergence of the correlation length is expected to be the same at both transitions and takes on the value @xmath52 .",
    "the lowest number of @xmath22 where two bkt phase transitions are expected is @xmath53 . in the present paper",
    "we study the phase transitions in models with @xmath54 in great detail .",
    "we have studied these values of @xmath22 in the strong coupling regime  @xcite , therefore it is natural to continue working with these models .",
    "our computations are performed on lattices with temporal extent @xmath55 and with spatial size in the range @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we formulate our model and establish the exact relation with a generalized @xmath2 @xmath0 spin model .",
    "here , we also explain why critical indices , determined from the dual spin correlation functions , become @xmath57 and @xmath58 , _",
    "i.e. _ the values are interchanged with the respect to what expected from the correlation of original degrees of freedom . in section  3",
    "we present the setup of monte carlo simulations , define the observables used in this work and present the numerical results of simulations .",
    "in particular , we locate the position of critical points and compute various critical indices at these points . as a further cross - check of the nature of the phase transitions , we also present results of a few simulations for the @xmath59 gauge model and compute the average action and the specific heat in the vicinity of critical points .",
    "our conclusions and perspectives are given in section  5 .",
    "we work on a @xmath2 lattice @xmath60 with spatial extension @xmath61 and temporal extension @xmath62 ; @xmath63 , where @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] denote the sites of the lattice and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , denotes a unit vector in the @xmath68-th direction .",

    "one can map the gauge model to a generalized @xmath2 spin @xmath0 model with the action @xmath81 the effective coupling constants @xmath29 can be computed exactly as follows .",

    "the dual model is ferromagnetic .",
    "however , @xmath90 is small and negative for @xmath91 . in the whole region @xmath92 ; moreover , in the critical region @xmath93 .",
    "similar properties hold for all @xmath22 .",
    "thus , one expects that the @xmath2 vector spin model with only @xmath33 non - vanishing gives a reasonable approximation to the gauge model ( in our simulations we use all @xmath29 ) .",
    "next important fact , evident from eq .",
    "( [ betak_n5 ] ) , is that the weak and the strong coupling regimes are interchanged : when @xmath94 both effective couplings @xmath95 and , therefore , the ordered symmetry - broken phase is mapped to a symmetric phase with vanishing magnetization of dual spins . the symmetric phase at small @xmath96 becomes an ordered phase where the dual magnetization is non - zero .",
    "let @xmath97 be the polyakov loop in the representation @xmath98 .",

    "i.e. _ it consists of links perpendicular to plaquettes of the original lattice and is closed in the temporal direction .",

    "it consists of a string of plaquettes connecting the cubes dual to the points @xmath104 and @xmath105 and measures the free energy of a @xmath0 monopole  anti - monopole pair .",
    "as was explained in the introduction , our aim is to study the critical behavior making use of quantities , like the binder cumulants , constructed from the dual @xmath0 spins . on very general grounds",
    "one expects that in the confined phase , where the potential between electric @xmath0 charges grows linearly with the distance , the correlation function  ( [ corr_dualspin ] ) shows ordered behavior , so that the magnetic charges are free . in the phase where the electric charges are deconfined",
    ", the correlation function  ( [ corr_dualspin ] ) exhibits exponential decay and the free energy of a monopole  anti - monopole pair grows with distance . in the massless phase ,",
    "if such phase exists , one anticipates that both kind of charges are confined by a weakly - growing logarithmic potential , hence both correlations decrease with a power law .",
    "it is not obvious , however , and to the best of our knowledge not proved so far , that the correlation of the polyakov loops and the dual correlation show similar critical behavior .",
    "in fact , as we shall argue below , their critical behavior is exactly opposite .",
    "let us suppose , there exists a massless phase and @xmath106 is the phase transition point from the electric confinement to the massless phase , while @xmath107 is the phase transition point from the massless phase to the deconfined phase .",
    "one then has for the polyakov loop correlation the following asymptotic behavior at the critical points ( for @xmath108 ) @xmath109 in the case of the dual correlations , the @xmath50 indices are interchanged @xmath110 if the @xmath2 @xmath41 vector gauge model belongs to the universality class of the corresponding @xmath25 @xmath0 spin model , we should find @xmath111 for @xmath22 fixed and @xmath62 increasing , @xmath112 . in the limit",
    "@xmath113 one ends up with a single phase transition from the confining to the deconfining phase .",
    "when @xmath62 is fixed and @xmath22 increases , @xmath107 diverges roughly as @xmath114 , while @xmath106 approaches the critical point of the finite - temperature @xmath38 lgt exponentially fast .",
    "the direct proof of all these properties would include the construction of rg equations describing the behavior of the system in the vicinity of phase transitions , something we could not accomplish so far . in the absence of such a proof , we give qualitative arguments why the behavior  ( [ plcorr_1])-([corr_dual_1 ] ) is rather natural and might be anticipated .",
    "first of all , the interchange of the critical indices can be easily seen in the @xmath25 @xmath0 spin models .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ plcorr_dual ] ) remains formally correct for the two - point correlation function of these models if one replaces the surface @xmath102 in  ( [ source ] ) with a dual path connecting the points @xmath104 and @xmath105",

    "the dependence of these quantities on @xmath96 is continuous .",
    "it follows that first and second order transitions are ruled out . as an example , we present in fig .  [",

    "in this paper we have studied the @xmath2 @xmath0 lgt at the finite temperature aiming at shedding light on the nature of phase transitions in these models for @xmath1 .",
    "this study was based on the exact dual transformation of the gauge models to generalized @xmath2 @xmath0 spin models . in section  2",
    "we presented an overview of the exact relation between couplings of these two models and described qualitatively the behavior of the polyakov loop correlation function and correlation of dual spins ( the disorder operator in the gauge formulation ) .",
    "furthermore , we have advanced some arguments that the critical behavior of polyakov loop correlations and dual correlations is reversed , in particular the values of the critical index @xmath50 at the two transitions are interchanged for the dual correlation function with respect to the polyakov loop correlation .",
    "the numerical part of the work has been devoted to the localization of the critical couplings and to the computation of the critical indices .",
    "the main results can be shortly summarized as follows :    * we have determined numerically the two critical couplings of @xmath170 lgts and given estimates of the critical indices @xmath50 at both transitions .",
    "for the first time we have a clear indication that for full @xmath2 @xmath0 vector lgt with @xmath44 the scenario of three phases is realized : a disordered phase at small @xmath96 , a massless or bkt one at intermediate values of @xmath96 and an ordered phase , occurring at larger and larger values of @xmath96 as @xmath22 increases .",
    "this matches perfectly with the @xmath37 limit , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath2 @xmath38 lgt , where the ordered phase is absent ; * we have found that the values of the critical index @xmath50 at the two transitions are compatible with the theoretical expectations ; * the index @xmath51 also appears to be compatible with the value @xmath171 , in agreement with universality predictions .    on the basis of this study",
    "we are led to conclude that finite - temperature @xmath2 @xmath0 lgts for @xmath1 undergo two phase transitions of the bkt type . moreover , these models belong to the universality class of the @xmath25 @xmath0 vector models which also have two infinite order phase transitions and a massless phase .    it should be emphasized that in this paper we have not studied the continuum limit of the theory , but rather concentrated on the very possibility of having two bkt - like phase transitions . at the moment we are performing simulations of the model on symmetric lattices with the goal to compute the zero - temperature string tension and extend our present computations to @xmath43 .",
    "all these will help constructing the continuum limit .",
    "also , we plan to extend our work to even @xmath22 , to calculate the helicity modulus and to establish scaling formulas for critical points with @xmath22 .",
