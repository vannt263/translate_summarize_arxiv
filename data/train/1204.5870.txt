    "we shall label the annihilation operators of the two optical fields @xmath10 ( fundamental ` f ' , of frequency @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( second harmonic ` s ' , frequency @xmath13 ) .",
    "these two modes are coupled to a continuum of modes , represented by the operators @xmath14 , through decay rates @xmath15 ( in practice , @xmath16  @xcite ) , as well as to each other through a second - harmonic interaction frequency @xmath17 . the mechanical oscillator",
    "` m ' is represented through its dimensionless quadratures @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and is characterized by the mechanical frequency @xmath5 and decay rate @xmath1 .",
    "we allow @xmath18 to couple to the two optical modes through the coupling constants @xmath20 ; we shall make the simplifying assumption that , since @xmath20 is proportional to the respective optical frequency , @xmath21 .",
    "thus , we can write the hamiltonian @xmath22 as a sum of four terms @xmath23 with the free hamiltonian ( we take units such that @xmath24 throughout the paper ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the dissipation hamiltonian @xmath28 where we leave the mechanical dissipation hamiltonian undefined , the optomechanical hamiltonian @xmath29 and , finally , the shg hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath30\\,.\\ ] ] in the expression for @xmath31 we defined two frequency ranges @xmath32 , which define the bath modes through which the two modes are damped . given the very large separation in frequency between the two optical modes , we can justify considering @xmath33 and @xmath34 as non - overlapping without violating the requirement that these two frequency ranges must be very large compared to @xmath15 that is necessary to ensure markovian dynamics .",
    "if the two frequency ranges were to have a significant overlap , , in the case of two optical modes spaced by a mechanical frequency that exist in different resonators but are coupled to the same bath , then one must be careful to use correctly modified input ",
    "output relations and equations of motion . in our case ,",
    "the standard input  output relations will be held valid . in the following",
    "we will obtain the linearized equations of motion for the system described by this hamiltonian .    as a first step we derive the heisenberg equations of motion for @xmath35 , which read : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the input field coupled to the fundamental mode ( the second harmonic ) having zero mean and two - time correlation function @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the detuning of the driving field from cavity resonance .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) are written in a frame rotating with the optical modes , , in an interaction picture with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , for the mechanical mode we have @xmath41 and @xmath42 where we used a brownian - motion  type damping model  @xcite .",
    "the self - adjoint langevin force @xmath43 is zero - mean and ( assuming the high - temperature limit ) delta - correlated as @xmath44 .",
    "we now linearize the equations of motion by considering a pumping field of large intensity . under these conditions",
    ", both the field modes of the toroid would be macroscopically populated .",
    "we are then allowed to take @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the ( large ) mean amplitude of each operator and @xmath47 is its fluctuation around such average . for simplicity of notation",
    ", we shall drop the ` @xmath48 ' in the operator fluctuations .",
    "we thus write ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50\\hat{a}_\\mathrm{f}+ig_\\mathrm{j}\\overline{a}_\\mathrm{j}\\hat{x}+\\hat{o}_j-\\sqrt{2\\kappa_\\mathrm{j}}\\hat{a}_\\mathrm{j}^\\mathrm{in}\\,\\ ] ] with @xmath51 and @xmath52 . despite the relation linking @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in what follows",
    "we shall continue to use both symbols for clarity . for the mechanical modes , the equation of motion for @xmath18 remains unchanged , while that for momentum becomes @xmath55 assuming , for now , the existence of a steady state we find the following equation relating the amplitude of the fundamental mode and that of the input noise @xmath56 where we have taken @xmath57 is the phase of @xmath58 .",
    "the input field is assumed to be in a monochromatic coherent state characterized by the ( real ) amplitude @xmath59 .",
    "for the parameters used throughout this paper , the first term on the left - hand side in the above equation can be safely neglected , whereupon the equation can easily be solved to obtain @xmath58 . for the second",
    "harmonic , we get @xmath60 while @xmath61 . the linearization of the equations of motion makes the dynamics gaussian so that any initial gaussian will remain such at any instant of time  @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the quadrature vector @xmath62 where we have defined the optical quadrature operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 of mode @xmath49 .",
    "similar definitions hold for the input - field operators .",
    "it is worth bearing in mind that all our operators are functions of time @xmath65 , and we have simply dropped the label @xmath65 for conciseness of notation . with these definitions ,",
    "the first moment of @xmath66 is zero and any gaussian state of the system is thus fully characterized by the covariance matrix @xmath67 .",
    "the equations of motion derived above can be concisely written as @xmath68 , with the input noise vector @xmath69 the drift matrix @xmath70 can be explicitly determined and depends on the set of parameters characterizing the dynamics of the three - mode system addressed here .",
    "its expression is too lengthy to be reported here and is thus deferred to the appendix .",
    "a close inspection of the form of @xmath70 reveals that , by assuming @xmath71 and introducing the rescaled parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the drift matrix is a universal expression of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , for a fixed value of @xmath75 the nature of the dynamics is determined solely by the ratio of the coupling constants . for small @xmath76 ,",
    "the interaction is dominated by the shg process .",
    "conversely , for @xmath77 , the dynamics resembles closely that of a standard optomechanics model with two fields  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical equations should be stable in order for a steady state to exist .",
    "this is assured if the real part of the spectrum of @xmath70 is negative , in which case the system will tend to a stationary state characterized by the covariance matrix that solves the lyapunov equation @xmath78 with the input - noise matrix @xmath79\\,.\\ ] ]    the stability condition for @xmath70 can be rephrased more formally in terms of the routh - hurwitz criterion  @xcite , which we have used in our quantitative characterization of the dynamics .",
    "we note in passing that the lyapunov equation above has a concise analytic solution for @xmath80 , as reported in ref .",
    "the covariance matrix encompasses the full information on the system at hand . here , we shall be interested in the entanglement - sharing properties of the three modes . in order to demonstrate the occurrence of genuine multipartite entanglement , we rely on the criterion based on negativity of partial transpose ( npt )  @xcite and we will make use of the logarithmic negativity as an entanglement quantifier  @xcite . for a bipartition consisting of subsystems @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) ,",

    "moreover , although this is not the case in general , in this situation the npt criterion is a necessary and sufficient condition for inseparability of pure and mixed gaussian states alike . in what follows",
    ", we characterize the entanglement structure in both reduced two - mode states and bipartite one - versus - two - mode ones . in order to do that",

    "is entangled more strongly with s near @xmath101 , and with f close to @xmath102 . at low ( yet still quite sizeable ) values of the mechanical quality factor , the region corresponding to @xmath103 is largely associated with separability of any two - mode reduction , except the narrow strip at @xmath100 mentioned above , which witnesses the fact that , in these conditions , the direct nonlinear coupling between the optical modes overcomes any entangling power of the optomechanical mechanism .",
    "larger values of @xmath104 , on the other hand , give rise to non - negligible areas of ( even strong ) optomechanical entanglement involving both the m  s pair and the m ",

    "[ fig : entangledregions](c ) where , remarkably , we find that even the all - optical entanglement is affected , spreading quite considerably in regions where , at lower @xmath104 , we had @xmath105 .",
    "this result might be interpreted as arising from the indirect coupling between the two optical modes , whose interaction is ruled not only by their direct nonlinear coupling but also by a detuning - dependent effective one mediated ( quasi - coherently ) by the mechanical mode .    also quite interesting is the behavior of the one - vs - two - mode entanglement .",

    "[ fig : entangledregions](d ) show the rich structure of entanglement sharing that is exhibited by our model .",
    "one - versus - two - mode entanglement turns out to be , in general , much more robust ( and larger ) with respect to noise affecting the system than the entanglement in any two - mode reduction , a feature that has already been shown in other optomechanics - related investigations  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : entangledregions](b ) , regions of full three - mode inseparability are shown even for a relatively low - quality mechanical oscillator . however , in this case , noise affecting the system through the mechanics is too strong to allow for much overlap between regions of three - mode inseparability . indeed , by increasing the mechanical quality factor by a factor of @xmath107 , giving the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : entangledregions](c ) , the overlap between regions of one - versus - two - mode entanglement increases significantly , covering virtually the whole stability area shown in the figure . in passing , we mention that we have applied a multipartite entanglement witness for continuous - variable states , multiwit , that was developed in ref .  @xcite using semi - definite optimization methods .",
    "the use of this instrument has confirmed the genuinely tripartite nature of the entanglement at hand in the regions of overlap among the three regions of one - versus - two - mode inseparability , which excludes the possibility of having generalized three - mode biseparable states . as a quantitative illustration for the high-@xmath104 case , in table  [ tab : en ]",

    "the results of this study are shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : tripartite ] for both the low- and high-@xmath104 cases and increasing optical input powers .",
    "the qualitative differences in the behavior of the tripartite entanglement is very marked at large input power :  whilst at low mechanical quality factors the high - power tripartite entanglement is null , it extends for most of the region @xmath111 $ ] at high mechanical quality factor , therefore leaving us with much room for maneuvering in the space of entangled three - mode states .",
    "+ let us finally explore the competition between the shg process and the optomechanics in our model .",
    "as @xmath17 grows in fig .",
    "[ fig : entangledregionschi](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : entangledregionschi](c ) , the entanglement for the f@xmath112 m and s@xmath112 m reductions decreases , whereas that for f@xmath112s covers an ever - larger area of the parameter space .",
    "the behavior of the entanglement in the bipartitions , fig .",
    "[ fig : entangledregionschi](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : entangledregionschi](d ) , is similar and also easily understood on an intuitive basis :  a bigger @xmath17 leads to larger regions of entanglement for the two bipartitions that involve one of the optical mode on its own ( , f@xmath112ms and s@xmath112mf ) , but a contraction in the parameter space where entanglement in the m@xmath112fs bipartition is observed .",
    "the inference of the full state of an optomechanical system is a major practical challenge  @xcite , mainly due to the fact that the mechanical quadratures are not directly accessible to an experiment .",
    "here we propose a technique , which requires the use of the system drawn schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : detection ] , that allows us to infer the mechanical quadratures indirectly .",
    "initially , we assume that the homodyne detectors needed in the scheme have infinite bandwidth ; we shall account for the finite bandwidth of any realistic apparatus later on .",
    "given such a system , one has access to the four input ( two each for the fundamental and the second harmonic ) and four output quadratures .",
    "one can then infer the intra - cavity optical modes using the input - output relation @xmath113 and similarly for the rest of the quadratures .",
    "it is clear that very good characterization of the system , including knowledge of all the coupling constants and the effect of vacuum input noise  @xcite is required to infer the intra - cavity quadratures accurately .",
    "once the four optical intra - cavity quadratures are known , it is natural to ask how the mechanical quadratures can be inferred .",
    "indeed , the key to our proposal is noticing that the inferred quadratures are obtained as a time trace .",
    "one can therefore make direct use of the equations of motion to obtain a time trace for the mechanical quadrature @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the covariances of these inferred quadratures can finally be used to build an inferred covariance matrix , @xmath114 . in the limit of infinite detector bandwidth , @xmath115 .",
    "we use a simple model for including the effects of a finite detector bandwidth .",
    "let the bandwidth of the detector be @xmath116 .",
    "then the point - spread function of the detector is taken to be @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the label @xmath65 is understood as the time at which the measurement was performed .",
    "normalization requires that @xmath119 . for each operator",
    "@xmath120 we assign an inferred operator @xmath121 as the convolution of @xmath122 with @xmath120 .",
    "it can easily be shown that @xmath123 .",
    "this means that we can infer the value of any @xmath124 by calculating the time derivative of the _ inferred _ @xmath125 .    with this at hand",
    ", we can finally show that the inferred covariance matrix , at the steady - state , is given by @xmath126{\\mathbf{d}}\\bigl[e^{{\\mathbf{a}}(\\tau - s)}-1\\bigr]^{\\mathrm{t}}\\,\\rmd s\\right\\}\\bigl({\\mathbf{a}}\\tau\\bigr)^{-{\\mathrm{t}}}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] modern homodyne detectors can operate with a bandwidth of the order of @xmath127ghz , which is much larger than typical values of @xmath5 in the micro - mechanical domain .",
    "therefore , it is understood that @xmath116 is by far the shortest timescale of the system .",
    "it then suffices to expand @xmath114 to first order in @xmath116 , which gives @xmath128 these expressions hint at the tantalizing possibility that by increasing @xmath116 electronically one could deduce the value of @xmath114 for _ vanishing _",
    "@xmath116 , and therefore infer @xmath80 itself . in our numerical exploration , the fidelity  @xcite for the inference of the mechanical mode using this method was above @xmath129% when @xmath116 corresponded to a bandwidth of @xmath130mhz .",
    "we have presented a system that combines a nonlinear optical process with optomechanics in a very natural manner .",
    "its monolithic design makes it very attractive for experimental , or even technological , applications .",
    "indeed , the system we presented is based on technology that is inherently compatible with integration on optoelectronic chips .",
    "our investigation concentrated on the dynamics of the system , but we also addressed the problem of the actual detection of the intra - cavity state by outlining a method involving homodyning all the input and output quadratures to infer the covariance matrix for the three intra - cavity modes .",
    "lastly , a numerical example using constants from recent experiments was used to illustrate the feasibility of observing these effects in a realistic system .",
    "+ looking further ahead , one can envisage several of these structures sharing a common photonic `` bus '' whose function is to populate the optical mode of each toroid at the fundamental frequency .",
    "the shg process and optomechanics could then be used to create an entangled state of the mechanics with the second - harmonic field , thereby generating for each structure an optical field , which can be routed out of the photonic bus without losses , due to the large separation in frequencies , that is entangled to the mechanical mode of the toroid .",
    "we remark that this system lends itself naturally to the distribution and certification of optomechanical entanglement as per the protocol recently proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
