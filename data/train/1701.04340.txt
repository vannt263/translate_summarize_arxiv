    "experimental results released in the last years have demonstrated that photon  induced interactions in hadronic collisions can be used to probe several aspects of the standard model ( sm ) as well as to test predictions of beyond sm physics ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular , the study of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction in hadronic collisions is an important source of information about the hadronic structure and also about qcd dynamics at high energies @xcite .",
    "as exclusive processes are driven by the gluon content of the target , with the cross sections being proportional to the square of the scattering amplitude , they are strongly sensitive to the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "additionally , the squared momentum transfer ( @xmath0 ) distributions give access to the spatial distribution of the gluons in the hadron and about fluctuations of the color fields ( see e.g. ref .",

    "we demonstrated that the experimental lhc run 1 data and the preliminary run 2 data can be sucessfully described within the color dipole formalism if non - linear effects in the qcd dynamics are taken into account .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the main ingredients can be constrained by the very precise hera data and hence the predictions for photon  induced interactions at the lhc are parameter free . in those previous works we presented our predictions for the @xmath0  integrated observables ",
    "rapidity distributions and total cross sections  which have been measured by the alice , cms and lhcb collaborations at the lhc in the run 1 . in principle , the @xmath0 - distributions may be measured in run 2 @xcite .",
    "this encourages us to extend our previous studies and present the color dipole predictions for the @xmath0  spectrum measured in exclusive vector meson photoproduction in hadronic collisions .",
    "in particular , in this paper we will use the color dipole formalism to describe the photon - hadron interaction , with the scattering amplitude being expressed in terms of the impact parameter color glass condensate ( bcgc ) model , which successfully describes the @xmath0 - distributions for the exclusive vector meson production at hera .",
    "we will compute the @xmath0 - spectrum for the exclusive @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 photoproduction in @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions at the lhc energies probed in the run 2 .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath5 collisions , we will consider the coherent and incoherent contributions to exclusive production , which are associated to processes where the nucleus target scatters elastically or breaks up , respectively .",
    "for a similar analysis considering alternative approaches see ref . @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the impact of the gluon saturation effects , associated to non - linear contributions for the qcd dynamics at high energies , we will compare our predictions with those obtained disregarding these effects , i. e. using a linear model for the qcd dynamics .",

    ", the @xmath20 process can be factorized in terms of the fluctuation of the virtual photon into a @xmath21 color dipole , the dipole - hadron scattering by a color singlet exchange and the recombination into the vector meson @xmath22 .",
    "the final state is characterized by the presence of a rapidity gap .",

    "our main focus will be on the transverse momentum distributions , which are expected to be studied considering the higher statistics of run 2 @xcite .",
    "however , firstly let us analyse the impact of the gluon saturation effects on the rapidity distributions at a fixed value of the momentum transfer @xmath0 .",

    "we observe that the difference between the linear and non - linear predictions is larger for lighter vector mesons , with the gluon saturation effects decreasing the magnitude of the cross sections .",
    "in particular , for exclusive @xmath1 photoproduction , the predictions differ by a factor @xmath78 at @xmath79 . on the hand , for the @xmath3 production , the predictions are similar .",
    "these results are expected , since the gluon saturation effects are predicted to suppress the contribution of the large size dipoles , which are dominant in the @xmath1 case , but contribute less for the @xmath3 production .",
    "moreover , these results indicate that the analysis of @xmath2 production is an important probe of the non - linear qcd dynamics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rap_aa ] , we present our predictions for @xmath80 collisions . in this case",
    "the difference between the linear and non - linear predictions is larger in comparison to the @xmath4 one .",
    "the difference is a factor of the order of 10 at @xmath79 for @xmath1 production , while for @xmath3 production it is @xmath81 2 .",
    "this result is also expected , since the saturation scale @xmath82 , which defines the onset of the gluon saturation effects , increases with the atomic mass number ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "our results indicate that in exclusive light vector meson photoproduction in @xmath84 collisions we are probing deep in the saturation regime .",
    "moreover , we observe that gluon saturation effects are non - negligible in the @xmath3 production .",
    "as verified in @xmath4 collisions , the study of @xmath2 production can be useful to understand in more detail the qcd dynamics .",
    "let us now to analyze the impact of the gluon saturation effects on the transverse momentum distributions .",
    "initially , let us consider @xmath4 collisions at @xmath75 tev assuming two different fixed values for the vector meson rapidity ( @xmath79 and 3 ) .",
    "the linear and non - linear predictions for exclusive @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 photoproduction are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdt_pp ] .",
    "our results for @xmath79 indicate that the presence of gluon saturation effects shifts the dip positions to smaller values of the transverse momentum , with the shift being larger for lighter mesons , where the contribution of these effects is larger . in particular , for the @xmath3 production , the shift is small @xmath85 gev@xmath86 , while for @xmath1 we have @xmath87 gev@xmath86 .",
    "moreover , for the production of light vector mesons , the number of dips in the range @xmath88 gev@xmath86 is larger when gluon saturation effects are present .",
    "another important aspect that can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdt_pp ] is that the position of the dip is not modified when we increase the rapidity .",
    "however , it is not so pronunced as for central rapidities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdt_aa ] we present our predictions for @xmath5 collisions at @xmath74 tev .",
    "we consider @xmath79 and present separately the coherent and incoherent contributions .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath89 . in the case of the incoherent predictions we only present predictions for @xmath90 gev@xmath86 , since the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in our calculations fails to describe the vanishing of the incoherent cross section as @xmath91 . as expected , we find that the coherent cross section clearly exhibits the typical diffractive pattern . moreover , the coherent processes are characterized by a sharp forward diffraction peak and the incoherent one by a weak @xmath0 - dependence .",
    "we have verified that the incoherent processes dominate at large - @xmath92 and the coherent ones at small values of the momentum transfer .",
    "this is expected , since increasing the momentum kick given to the nucleus the probability that it breaks up becomes larger .",
    "additionally , the presence of gluon saturation effects strongly decreases the magnitude of the coherent cross sections , in particular for lighter vector mesons , and implies a shift in the position of the dip to smaller values of @xmath0 . in the case of the incoherent contribution , we have that the linear and non - linear predictions are similar .",
    "our results indicate that incoherent processes dominate at large - @xmath92 and the coherent ones at small values of the momentum transfer .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the analysis of the @xmath0 dependence can be useful to separate coherent and incoherent interactions .",
    "however , as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , the experimental separation of these processes is still a challenge .",
    "an alternative is the detection of the fragments of the nuclear breakup produced in the incoherent processes .",
    "e.g. the detection of emitted neutrons by zero - degree calorimeters . considering that this separation is not yet possible , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsigdt_aa_sum ] we present our predictions for the sum of the coherent and incoherent contributions .",
    "we observe that the incoherent contribution partially fills the dip in the tranverse momentum distribution .",
    "however , it is still present , with its position being affected by gluon saturation effects .",
    "the study of exclusive vector meson photoproduction in hadronic collisions is strongly motivated by the expectation that this process may allow us to probe the qcd dynamics at high energies , driven by the gluon content of the target ( proton or nucleus ) which is strongly sensitive to non - linear effects ( parton saturation ) .",
    "our goal in this paper was to extend and complement previous studies about exclusive vector meson photoproduction in @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions , presenting the color dipole predictions for the transverse momentum distributions taking into account gluon saturation effects in the qcd dynamics .",
    "in particular , we have used an approach that reproduces well the available hera data on vector meson photo and electroproduction , including data on the @xmath0-distributions , as well as the run 1 lhc data on vector meson photoproduction .",
    "we presented predictions for the @xmath0 - spectrum of the exclusive @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 photoproduction in @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions , which could be compared with future experimental lhc data . in order to estimate the impact of the gluon saturation effects ,",
    "we also have presented a comparison with the predictions obtained disregarding these effects .",
    "our results demonstrate that gluon saturation effects reduce the magnitude of the cross sections , with the reduction being larger for lighter vector mesons .",
    "moreover , the gluon saturation effects change the positions of the dips with respect to the linear regime , shifting the dips to smaller values of the transverse momentum .",
    "finally , our results indicate that dips predicted by the coherent contribution in @xmath5 collisions should be visible , independently of the fact that this contribution could not been easily experimentally separated .",
    "these results are robust predictions of the saturation physics , which can be used to investigate non - linear qcd dynamics in the kinematical range of the run 2 of the lhc .",
