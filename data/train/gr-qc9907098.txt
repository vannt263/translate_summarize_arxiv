    "the physics of compact objects is entering a particularly exciting phase .",
    "new instruments , including x - ray and gamma - ray satellites and the new neutrino observatories sno and super - kamiokande , can now yield unprecedented observations of neutron stars and black holes .",
    "perhaps most excitingly , the new gravitational wave detectors ligo , tama , geo and virgo promise to open a gravitational wave window to the universe and make gravitational wave astronomy a reality ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "simultaneously , the availability of computational resources at modern supercomputers makes the simulation of realistic astrophysical scenarios involving relativistic compact objects feasable .",
    "several groups , including two `` grand challenge alliances ''  @xcite , have launched efforts to construct numerical codes capable of solving einstein s equations with or without matter sources in three dimensions , and simulating the merger of black hole or neutron star binaries ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations will be necessary to predict the gravitational wave form from such processes to increase the likelihood of detections and , ultimately , to extract physical information from observations . even though much progress has recently been made ( see  @xcite for the most recent developments ) , significant obstacles still remain .    in this contribution , we report on our systematic approach towards constructing such a numerical code .",
    "we first review our formulation of einstein s equations and describe several tests , both for vacuum spacetimes and analytical matter sources , which demonstrate its advantages for numerical integrations .",
    "we then outline our implementation of hydrodynamics , and present promising numerical test results .",
    "we adopt geometrized units ( g = c = 1 ) and the convention that greek indices run from 0 to 3 , while latin indices only run from 1 to 3 .",
    "most numerical implementations of einstein s equations adopt a cauchy formulation based on the 3 + 1 formulation by arnowitt , deser and misner ( @xcite , see , e.g. ,  @xcite for an alternative characteristic formulation )",
    ". however , a straightforward implementation of these `` undressed '' adm equations tends to develop instabilities even for the evolution of small amplitude gravitational waves on a flat background ( compare  @xcite ) . following shibata and nakamura  @xcite and the spirit of many earlier one and two - dimensional codes  @xcite , we have recently developed a modification of the adm equations which proves to be much more suitable for numerical implementations  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we modify the adm equations in two ways . first , we split the spatial metric @xmath0 into a conformal factor @xmath1 and a conformally related metric @xmath2 according to @xmath3 and evolve @xmath4 and @xmath2 separately .",
    "we choose @xmath4 such that @xmath5 , and similarly split the extrinsic curvature into its trace and its trace - free part .",
    "this split separates the `` radiative '' variables from the `` non - radiative '' variables in the spirit of the `` york - lichnerowicz '' decomposition  @xcite .    in the second stage",
    "we introduce `` conformal connection functions '' @xmath6 as independent functions ( compare  @xcite ) .",
    "some of the mixed second derivatives of @xmath2 in the conformal , spatial ricci tensor @xmath7 can now be written as first derivatives of the @xmath8 . as a result",
    ", @xmath7 becomes a manifestly elliptic operator on the metric @xmath9 .",
    "the analogous technique was used for the four - dimensional ricci tensor @xmath10 as early as in the 1920 s to make einstein s equations manifestly hyperbolic  @xcite . for more details of our formulation , including an evolution equation for the @xmath11 , the reader is referred to  @xcite ( see also the mathematical analysis in  @xcite , and further numerical applications in  @xcite ) .    in  @xcite , we tested this form of einstein s equations for small amplitude gravitational waves , and found that it performs far better than a similar implementation of the original adm formulation .",
    "in particular , we found that we could evolve such waves with harmonic slicing without encountering growing instabilities , whereas the original adm code crashed after about 35 light - crossing times for the same initial data . in  @xcite",
    ", we inserted analytic matter sources on the right hand side of einstein s equations and evolved the fields in their presence .",
    "this approach allows us to study the numerical properties of the field evolution in the presence of highly relativistic matter sources without having to solve the equations of hydrodynamics : `` hydro - without - hydro '' .",
    "we inserted the oppenheimer - snyder solution for a relativistic , static star to test the long term stability of the evolution code , and the oppenheimer - volkov solution for the collapse of a sphere of dust to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "these simulations focus on the highly relativistic , longitudinal fields , and complement our earlier tests involving dynamical transverse fields in  @xcite . with the code having passed these tests , we are now implementing both collisionless matter , which will be described elsewhere , and hydrodynamics , as described below , to evolve the matter self - consistently with the fields .",
    "for a perfect fluid , the stress - energy tensor can be written @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the rest mass density , @xmath14 the specific internal density , @xmath15 the pressure , @xmath16 the fluid four velocity , and @xmath17 the four dimensional spacetime metric .",
    "we construct constant entropy initial data with a polytropic equation of state @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the polytropic index , and where we assume the polytropic constant @xmath21 to be unity without loss of generality . during the evolution",
    ", we adopt the gamma - law relation appropriate for adiabatic flow , @xmath22    following  @xcite , we write the equation of continuity @xmath23 and the equations of motion @xmath24 in the form @xmath25 here we have defined the auxiliary quantities @xmath26 similar equations have been used by many other groups ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we integrate equations  ( [ e : twb:1 ] )  -  ( [ e : twb:2 ] ) with an artificial viscosity scheme suggested in  @xcite ( see  @xcite for implementations of more elaborate shock capturing schemes ) . given @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 on a new timelevel , @xmath30 can be found iteratively from the normalization relation @xmath31 , which yields @xmath32 the matter sources for the right hand sides of einstein s equations can then be constructed from these variables .",
    "as a first test of our implementation of hydrodynamics , we adopt the oppenheimer - volkov solution describing equilibrium neutron stars in spherical symmetry as initial data and evolve these dynamically . constructing a sequence of such oppenheimer - volkov solutions for increasing central rest mass densities @xmath33 , the adm mass @xmath34 of the star takes a maximum @xmath35 at @xmath36 ( see the left panel in figure  1 ) . for central densities smaller than @xmath36 ,",
    "the star is in stable equilibrium , while for @xmath37 it is unstable and will collapse to a black hole .",
    "we adopt a polytropic equation of state with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , for which @xmath40 and @xmath41 when @xmath42 .",
    "we choose as initial data the two configurations marked with filled circles in figure  1 ; a stable configuration with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and an unstable configuration with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    in the right panel of figure  1",
    ", we show the central density as a function of time for the two initial configurations .",
    "we performed these runs on quite modest numerical grids with @xmath49 gridpoints using cartesian coordinates and imposing outgoing wave boundary conditions at @xmath50 .",
    "we employ harmonic slicing and zero shift .",
    "as expected , the unstable configuration soon collapses , while the stable configuration remains stable for several dynamical timescales ( the period of the fundamental radial oscillation for a @xmath51 configuration is approximately @xmath52 , compare  @xcite ) .",
    "ultimately , accumulation of numerical error causes this configuration to collapse too , but this can be delayed by increasing the grid resolution .    in figure",
    "2 we show density contours at the beginning and towards the end of the simulation for the unstable configuration with @xmath53 initially . we also include arrows indicating the fluid flow @xmath29",
    ". the star is rapidly contracting and collapsing to a black hole .",
    "up to the late stage of the collapse , the mass @xmath34 is conserved to about 5 % .",
    "we can follow the collapse to about a 18 fold increase of the central density . by this time",
    ", the central lapse has decreased from 0.4 initially to about 0.03 .",
    "we report on our systematic approach towards constructing a fully relativistic hydrodynamics code in three spatial dimensions . as part of this program ,",
    "we have developed a new formulation of einstein s equations which in several tests and applications has proved to be much more suitable for numerical implementations than the traditional adm formulation  @xcite .",
    "mathematical properties of this formulation have been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the evolution of small amplitude gravitational waves to test dynamical transverse fields and have inserted analytical solutions as matter sources ( hydro - without - hydro ) to test highly relativistic longitudinal fields .",
    "we outline our implementation of the relativistic equations of hydrodynamics and present preliminary test results for spherical neutron stars in hydrostatic equilibrium ( oppenheimer - volkov stars ) .",
    "as expected , we find that stable stars remain stable for several dynamical timescales , while unstable stars soon collapse to black holes .",
    "we conclude that our method seems like a very promising approach towards simulating the final plunge and merger of binary neutron stars .    on a more speculative note , we point out that fully self - consistent hydrodynamics may not be a feasable approach towards simulating the coalescence and gravitational wave emission from neutron stars in the intermediate inspiral phase . in this epoch ,",
    "the stars are very close and interact through a strongly relativistic tidal field , but reside outside the innermost stable circular orbit and hence move on a nearly circular orbit .",
    "simulating the slow inspiral would require evolving the stars for hundreds or thousands of orbits , which is presently impossible .",
    "it may be possible , however , to insert known quasi - equilibrium binary configurations ( e.g.  @xcite ) into the field evolution code to get the transverse wave components approximately . decreasing the orbital separation ( and increasing the binding energy ) at the rate consistent with the computed outflow of gravitational - wave energy",
    "would generate an approximate strong - field wave inspiral pattern .",
    "such a `` hydro - without - hydro '' calculation may yield an approximate gravitational waveform from inspiraling neutron stars , without having to couple the matter and field integrations .",
