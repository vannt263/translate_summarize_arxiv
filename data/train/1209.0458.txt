    "sdss  j1029 + 2623 @xcite is a unique quasar lens system with three images of the @xmath8 quasar produced by a foreground cluster of galaxies at @xmath9 .",
    "such `` naked cusp '' configurations are predicted to comprise a significant fraction of cluster - scale quasar lenses @xcite .",
    "all three quasar images are also detected at radio @xcite and x - ray wavelengths @xcite , and show mini - broad absorption line ( mini - bal ) features in the ly@xmath10 , siiv , and civ emission lines .",
    "these earlier observations already implied that the lensing cluster is likely complex .",
    "the optical images clearly show two bright central galaxies in the lensing cluster .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy found that the two galaxies have a velocity difference of @xmath11 @xcite , which might imply a high - speed collision of two massive haloes .",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations show that the x - ray surface mass distribution is centred on one of the central galaxies , with an additional x - ray subpeak @xmath12 north - west of the main peak that has no optical counterpart @xcite .",
    "this complex x - ray morphology also suggests that the lensing cluster is in a merger .",
    "it is crucial to construct a reliable mass model from a lensing analysis in order to draw any conclusion on the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "another interesting feature of this system is the anomalous flux ratios seen in the quasar images .",
    "simple mass models predict the relative brightnesses of the three quasar images @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 should be @xmath16 , whereas optical , radio , and x - ray observations all found relative brightnesses of @xmath17 .",
    "the fact that this `` anomaly '' is seen in radio @xcite and absorption - corrected x - ray @xcite flux ratios indicates that it is not due to extinction by any intervening matter .",
    "in addition , the rough agreement of the flux ratios between three different wavelengths implies that it is not entirely due to stellar microlensing ( but see also * ? ? ? * ) , particularly since microlensing generally leads to large differences between optical and x - ray flux ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus the most plausible explanation for the anomalous flux ratio is millilensing by ( dark halo ) substructures @xcite .",
    "an accurate macro lens model is crucial for breaking the degeneracy between the macro model uncertainties and the amount of substructure required to account for the flux ratios .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new lensing analysis of sdss  j1029 + 2623 utilizing deep multiband _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations of this system .",
    "several multiply imaged galaxies , which are newly identified from the _ hst _ images , are used to construct an accurate mass model of the core of the lensing cluster .",
    "strong lensing results are then combined with weak lensing results from the _ hst _ images and our earlier wide - field weak lensing analysis based on the subaru / suprime - cam images @xcite .",

    "chandra _ x - ray surface brightness profiles @xcite and the anomalous flux ratios between the quasar images .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "after briefly describing the observations in section  [ sec : obs ] , we present the strong lensing analysis in section  [ sec : slens ] and the weak lensing analysis in section  [ sec : wlens ] .",
    "we then combine the various observations in section  [ sec : comb ] to discuss the properties of the lensing cluster .",

    "the observation consisted of 2 orbits ( total exposure 5276  sec ) of acs / f475w imaging on 2011 may 15 , 3 orbits ( total exposure 8010  sec ) of acs / f814w imaging on 2011 april 17 , and 2 orbits ( total exposure 5223.5  sec ) of wfc3/f160w imaging on 2011 april 15 .",
    "we mostly follow the data reduction procedure described in @xcite , which uses multidrizzle @xcite for cosmic ray removal , distortion removal and stacking .",
    "a pixel scale of @xmath21 is adopted for both the acs and wfc3 images .",
    "the acs ( wfc3 ) frames are drizzled using the lanczos3 ( square ) kernel , with a pixfrac of 1 ( 0.8 ) .",
    "the acs data are preprocessed using the pipeline calacs , which also removes bias striping and provides a pixel - level charge transfer inefficiency correction .",
    "we use sextractor @xcite to construct a photometric catalogue of the galaxies in the _ hst _ images . for each galaxy , we derive a total magnitude from the mag_auto parameter and a @xmath22 diameter aperture magnitude .",
    "we show the colour - magnitude diagram of the sdss  j1029 + 2623 field from the two acs images in figure  [ fig : colmag ] .",
    "the figure shows a clear red - sequence of passively evolving galaxies in the lensing cluster at @xmath23 .",
    "we also use wide - field subaru suprime - cam @xcite images of sdss  j1029 + 2623 for the analysis .",
    "these images consist of 1200  sec @xmath24-band , 2700  sec @xmath25-band , and 1920  sec @xmath26-band images , with a seeing fwhm of @xmath27 in @xmath25-band .",

    "the main objective of the _ hst _ imaging observation was to constrain the central mass distribution of the lensing cluster using strong lensing information . for this purpose , we identify multiply imaged galaxies in addition to the three quasar images based on their colours and morphologies combined with matching multiple image candidates while iteratively refining the mass models ( see below for details of our mass model ) . in total",
    ", we identified 5 additional sets of multiply imaged galaxies ( i d 1 - 5 ) , which are shown in figures  [ fig : sdss1029rgb_all ] and [ fig : zoom_all ] , and summarized in table  [ tab : img ] .",
    "in addition , the _ hst _ image shown in figure  [ fig : sdss1029rgb_all ] exhibits a prominent host galaxy of the lensed quasar which is highly elongated due to lensing . in order to take account of the shape of the lensed host galaxy",
    ", we include an additional set of multiple images ( i d 6 ) which roughly correspond to the edge of the host galaxy .",

    "we use these data to constrain the virial mass @xmath29 and the concentration parameter @xmath30 , assuming the nfw profile .",
    "the fit was performed for the mass range of @xmath31 and the concentration parameter range of @xmath32 .",
    "we show constraints in the @xmath29-@xmath30 plane in figure  [ fig : cont_mc ] , and summarize the resulting constraints on @xmath29 and @xmath30 in table  [ tab : mc ] .",
    "the individual constraints are quite degenerate in this plane , but along slightly different directions so that we obtain a tighter constraint when combining the three constraints .",
    "we find @xmath33 and @xmath4 from the combined analysis .",
    "the large concentration parameter value for the virial mass of @xmath34 is in line with a recent study the @xmath29-@xmath30 relation for strong lensing clusters @xcite , which can be explained by the effect of baryon cooling and central galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the high concentration for this cluster should be interpreted cautiously given the complex core structure with two density peaks .",
    "we compare the tangential shear profiles with the best - fit model prediction in figure  [ fig : profile_all ] .",
    "the three observational constraints are complementary and they are consistent with each other where they overlap .",
    "the best - fit nfw profile reproduces the observations for a wide range in radii .",
    "predicted by the best - fit strong lens model ( _ filled triangles _ ) for @xmath35 .",

    "the lower panel shows the radial profile of the @xmath39 rotated component @xmath40 .",
    "[ fig : profile_all ] ]    here we discuss several systematic effects that can affect our results .",
    "one is the redshift distribution of source galaxies for weak lensing analysis .",
    "since the area of the field used for our weak lensing analysis is small , the redshift distribution in this field can be different from that of a mean distribution .",
    "another effect is a multiplicative shear measurement bias , which is estimated to be @xmath41% for our subaru weak lensing measurements .",
    "also the _ hst _ weak lensing measurement probes the region @xmath42 , where weak lensing measurements are less tested and therefore less reliable . to estimate a possible impact of these systematic errors",
    ", we consider an extreme situation where both the _ hst _ and subaru weak lensing measurements are offset by @xmath43% , and find the resulting shifts of the best - fit virial mass to be @xmath44 .",
    "the systematic error for this case is still comparable to the @xmath38 statistical error , implying that these systematic errors are not significant .       from the _ chandra _ x - ray analysis and from the combined lensing analysis ( _ solid line _",
    "; see section  [ sec : raden ] ) , assuming a spherically symmetric mass distribution . for the _ chandra _ x - ray analysis",
    ", we show the results for the isothermal @xmath45-model from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* _ open circle _ ) and a @xmath45-model with the temperature profile of ( * ? ?",
    "* _ open squares _ ) .",
    "the errors in the x - ray masses come from the statistical errors in the x - ray temperature measurement . for reference",
    ", we also show the cluster radii @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , which are computed from the best - fit lensing mass profile , as well as the einstein radius @xmath49 .",
    "[ fig : m3d ] ]    @xcite presented the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray analysis of sdss  j1029 + 2623 , and derived a mass profile assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermality .",
    "figure  [ fig : m3d ] compares the x - ray mass profile from @xcite with the result of the combined lensing analysis in section  [ sec : raden ] .",
    "we find that the mass profiles derived from lensing and x - ray differ significantly with each other .",
    "while the enclosed masses agree at the radius of @xmath50 that roughly corresponds to the einstein radius of this system , the enclosed masses inferred from the x - ray data are a factor of @xmath5 larger than those inferred from the combined lensing analysis at radii @xmath51 , where @xmath48 is defined by the radius within which the average density is 2500 times the critical density at the cluster redshift .",
    "we note that the lensing derived mass implies an x - ray temperature and luminosity of @xmath52  kev and @xmath53  erg  s@xmath54 based on x - ray scaling relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are significantly lower than the observed x - ray temperature of @xmath55  kev and @xmath56  erg  s@xmath54 @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that recent systematic weak lensing analysis of clusters at @xmath57 found somewhat smaller weak lensing masses for a given x - ray temperature @xcite , which is qualitatively similar to our result , although the difference appears to be much smaller than found here .",
    "there are several effects that can lead to a systematic difference between the x - ray and lensing masses .",
    "one of the most significant effects for x - ray cluster mass measurements is any violation of the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium due the presence of non - thermal pressure support .",
    "however , this effect typically leads to an underestimate of the x - ray mass , particularly in the outskirts of clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and would only make the discrepancy larger .",
    "another possibility is our assumption of isothermality .",
    "in fact , x - ray temperatures generally decrease at large radii , but our _ chandra _ data were not sensitive enough to detect such a decrease . to examine this effect",
    ", we adopt a temperature profile obtained from hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , which appears to be consistent with recent x - ray observations of cluster outskirts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and recalculate the x - ray mass profile . while this reduces the difference at the center , it can not explain the overall difference between the x - ray and lensing masses .",
    "it is also difficult to explain the difference by a triaxial halo , because the large @xmath30 implies that the major - axis of the cluster is more likely to be aligned with the line - of - sight direction , in which case the lensing mass should be overestimated @xcite .",
    "the most likely explanation for the mass discrepancy is shock heating of the intracluster gas during a merger .",
    "numerical simulations show significant boosts of x - ray luminosity and temperature @xmath58  gyr after mergers , which can lead to significant overestimates of x - ray masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , there are several clusters showing signs of ongoing mergers that also have significantly higher x - ray masses than lensing masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed the lensing cluster of sdss  j0129 + 2623 shows hints of an ongoing merger , including the bimodal nature of cluster cores , the complex x - ray morphology , a possible offset between mass and x - ray centroids , and the large g1-g2 velocity difference . in addition , a line - of - sight merger can naturally explain the high concentration estimates for this cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopy of many more cluster member galaxies is needed to understand this complex cluster further .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the agreement between x - ray and lensing masses near the einstein radius might just be a coincidence , in that both the masses are overestimated by merger shock heating and halo elongation along the line - of - sight , respectively .",
    "another useful cross - check of our interpretation is provided by the gas - to - mass ratio , @xmath59 , because it is expected to roughly match the cosmic baryon fraction @xmath60 @xcite for massive clusters , and also because @xmath61 appears to be the most promising cluster mass proxy @xcite .",
    "we use the gas mass profile implied by the isothermal @xmath45-model from @xcite to estimate a gas mass within the radius @xmath62mpc from the combined lensing analysis .",
    "we find a gas mass fraction of @xmath63 , which is significantly smaller than the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "the gas mass fraction is slightly increased to @xmath64 when the temperature profile of @xcite is used to derive the total mass , but the value is still low . on the other hand , when the lensing mass estimate is used for the total mass , we obtain a gas mass fraction of @xmath65 , which is in better agreement with @xmath66 estimates in other clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this further supports our interpretation that the x - ray derived mass is significantly overestimated due to shock heating of the intracluster gas during a merger .",
    "]    our strong lens models in section  [ sec : slens ] confirm the earlier claims @xcite that a substructure is required to explain the anomalous flux ratios between the three quasar images . in order to search for possible substructures ,",
    "we subtract the quasars from each _ hst _ image and carefully examine the residual images . in the acs / f814w image , we find a probable galaxy in the vicinity of image c , as shown in figure  [ fig : sdss1029bc_sub ] .",
    "we fit the galaxy , named gx , assuming a sersic profile with index @xmath67 using _ galfit _",
    "@xcite , and find the centroid of the galaxy to be @xmath68 from image c ( r.a.=157.309482 , decl.=26.394158 ) , and that the magnitude of the galaxy is @xmath69 .",
    "these estimates have large uncertainties due to the significant residuals from the subtraction of image c ( see figure  [ fig : sdss1029bc_sub ] ) . in the strong lens models we estimate that galaxy g2 with @xmath70 has a velocity dispersion of @xmath71 , which implies a velocity dispersion of @xmath72 for gx assuming @xmath73",
    ". the inferred velocity dispersion of gx is large enough to mean that it will significantly perturb the flux of image c.      ]    we next explore the impact of gx on the strong lens models .",
    "here we assume the same mass model as used in section  [ sec : slens ] , but include an additional component modelled by pseudo - jaffe model at the location of gx with the velocity dispersion and the cutoff radius as free parameters .",
    "we find that the best - fit model has @xmath74 including the flux ratios , which is significantly smaller than the @xmath75 of the original best - fit model ( @xmath76 ) and the large improvement is due to improvements in fitting the flux ratios .",
    "this confirms the argument by @xcite that a substructure in the vicinity of image c can explain the anomalous flux ratio .",
    "the velocity dispersion of galaxy gx in the best - fit model is @xmath77 , which is broadly consistent with the velocity dispersion expected from the magnitude .",
    "we summarize the flux ratios of the best - fit mass models , as well as the observed flux ratios at various wavelengths , in figure  [ fig : fratio ] .",
    "the best - fit models with and without galaxy gx have quite different total magnification factors . for the model without galaxy gx , the magnifications for the quasar images are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , whereas for the model with galaxy gx , they are @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "the total magnifications are @xmath84 for the model without gx and @xmath85 for the model with gx .",
    "substructures near merging image pairs can have large effects on time delays between the images @xcite .",
    "this was indeed the case for sdss  j1004 + 4112 @xcite , another large - separation lensed quasar produced by a massive cluster of galaxies , in which a time delay between the smallest image pair was found to be affected by the perturbation from nearby cluster member galaxies @xcite .",
    "we find that our best - fit mass models predict the time delay between image b and c as @xmath86  day for the model without gx , and @xmath87  day for the model with gx . in both cases ,",
    "image b leads image c as expected from the image geometry . on the other hand",
    ", gx has a negligible impact on the ab time delay .",
    "the large difference of @xmath88 implies that measuring the bc time delay will greatly help constrain the substructure that affects these quasar images .          an interesting feature of sdss  j1029 + 2623 is the presence of a highly elongated host galaxy , which is most prominent in the _ hst _ wfc3/f160w image .",
    "here we examine whether our best - fit models reproduce the morphology of the lensed host galaxy .",
    "to do so , we include the host galaxy modelled by a sersic profile , and optimise the parameters ( the total flux , size , ellipticity and position angle ) of the sersic profile assuming the best - fit mass models , both with and without galaxy gx .",
    "we fix the centroid of the host galaxy in the source plane to the best - fit source quasar position .",
    "the optimisation is conducted on a pixel - by - pixel basis using a binned _ hst _ wfc3/f160w image with a pixel scale of @xmath89 .",
    "the model - predicted images are convolved with a psf assuming a moffat profile with a fwhm of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , before comparing with the observed image .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : hostcomp ] .",
    "we find that our best - fit models reproduce the morphology of the lensed host galaxy quite well .",
    "the match is better for the model with galaxy gx , which further supports its presence and the significant impact of galaxy gx on this lens system .",
    "in particular , we note that the observed host galaxy shows signs of a kink near image c ( see also figure  [ fig : sdss1029bc_sub ] ) which is reproduced in our best - fit model with galaxy gx .",

    "the best - fit effective radius and sersic index are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the presence of galaxy gx has a negligible impact on the total magnification of the host galaxy .",

    "we have identified 6 new multiply imaged galaxies in addition to the three - image lensed quasar . based on the newly identified multiple images , we construct an accurate mass model at the cluster core .",
    "we find dark haloes with roughly similar masses should be associated with both of the bright central galaxies .",
    "the strong lens models allow us to estimate the einstein radius of the overall lens as @xmath1 .",

    "we have also detected a significant weak lensing signal in the _ hst _ acs image .",
    "the mass map obtained from the strong and weak lensing analysis appears to be different from the x - ray surface brightness profile @xcite , suggesting an ongoing merger .",
    "we have constrained the radial mass profile of the cluster from the _ hst _ strong and weak lensing analysis as well as the subaru weak lensing result @xcite .",
    "the combination of the three lensing constraints enabled a robust determination of the radial mass profile , with a best - fit virial mass of @xmath97 and a concentration parameter of @xmath4 .",
    "the lensing derived mass profile differs significantly from the mass profile inferred from the _ chandra _ x - ray data assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermality , such that the x - ray mass is a factor of @xmath5 larger at outer radii of @xmath98 .",
    "we ascribe the mass discrepancy to shock heating of the intracluster gas during a merger , which leads to significant overestimates of x - ray cluster masses .",
    "our interpretation is supported by the small cluster gas mass fraction implied by the x - ray estimates of total masses , with @xmath63 , as compared to @xmath65 using the lensing estimate of the total mass .",
    "a merger along the line - of - sight can also explain the high concentration parameter value found for the cluster , and is consistent with the large velocity difference of @xmath99 between the bright central galaxies g1 and g2 @xcite . the merger interpretation for this strong lens selected cluster , in turn , may imply a large impact of cluster mergers on strong lensing cross sections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the merger interpretation is correct , one question is whether the large velocity difference is compatible with the theoretical expectations .",
    "there are several works examining the distribution of velocity differences between close halo pairs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicate that a relative velocity of @xmath11 for haloes with @xmath100 is quite rare .",
    "therefore , it is important to make more quantitative comparisons taking account of the redshift and mass of sdss j1029 + 2623 in order to check whether this large velocity difference can be explained in the framework of the standard @xmath101-dominated cold dark matter cosmology .",
    "we confirm the earlier claims @xcite that the observed flux ratios between the quasar images can not be reproduced by strong lens models without any substructure in the vicinity of the quasar images . from a careful inspection of the _ hst _ images ,",
    "we have identified a probable galaxy gx which is only @xmath68 from quasar image c. a mass model including gx successfully reproduces the observed flux ratios , thereby resolving the flux ratio anomaly .",
    "while gx has little effect on the ab time delay measured by @xcite , the bc time delay is a sensitive probe of its effects .",
    "we have also checked the morphology of the lensed host galaxy and found a very good agreement with the model prediction .",
    "the best - fit model predict the total magnification of the quasar as @xmath102 and that of the lensed quasar host galaxy as @xmath103 .",
    "finally we note that additional observations are essential to better characterise this unique quasar - cluster lens system .",
    "for instance , the measurement of the time delay between quasar images b and c will be important for constraining the properties of galaxy gx .",
    "the merger interpretation for the lensing cluster should be checked by extensive spectroscopy of cluster member galaxies .",
    "spectroscopy of the multiply imaged galaxies identified in this paper is important both for more robust mass models and for possible cosmological constraints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
