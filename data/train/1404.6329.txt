    "a key ingredient in understanding quantum information may be quantum correlation .",
    "a well - known example of quantum correlation is entanglement .",
    "an entanglement can not be obtained by a local operation and classical communication(locc)@xcite .",
    "an entanglement is known to be very fragile to a local noisy channel .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that a quantum state without entanglement contains non - locality@xcite .",
    "l. henderson and v. vedral@xcite suggested a method to obtain a classical correlation between parties . h.ollivier and w.h.zurek@xcite defined a quantum correlation called quantum discord .",
    "the quantum discord can be understood as the quantum correlation which is the total correlation minus the classical correlation in a bipartite quantum state .",
    "quantum discord can contain a value even in a separable state@xcite .",
    "the quantum discord is invariant under unitary operation@xcite .",
    "in addition , quantum discord seems to have a relation with noisy teleportation , entanglement distillation and quantum state merging@xcite . some experimental effort to check quantum discord are under progress@xcite .",
    "+ quantum discord depends on the measurement setting . in @xcite",
    "a projective measurement was used in obtaining quantum discord .",
    "the measurement for optimal quantum discord should build the maximum of the classical correlation . it was shown in @xcite that 2 element optimal povm should be projective measurements .",
    "quantum discord for a bell - diagonal state was analytically obtained@xcite .",
    "much research has had a focus on finding the quantum discord of the x state@xcite .",
    "+ there are two reasons why the quantum discord of the two qubit x states becomes significant .",
    "the first reason is that the x state can be obtained through a unitary transformation to a two qubit state .",
    "the second one is that the general two qubit state can become a x state under a noisy channel@xcite .",
    "@xcite tried to find an analytic formula of quantum discord to x state .",
    "however , it is known that the result of @xcite holds only to special x state@xcite .",
    "fanchini et .",
    "@xcite tried to find an analytic formula of the quantum discord for symmetric x state .",
    "recently , by using von neumann measurement y. huang showed that the result of @xcite may be valid with some worst - case error@xcite .",
    "+ in this report we show that three element povm can provide a better quantum discord .",
    "al@xcite showed that there are some quantum states where 3 element povm should be used for optimal quantum discord .",
    "the optimality for 3 element povm can be found by a triangle formed by the direction vectors . by using 3 element povm",
    ", we numerically obtained the quantum discord to the quantum state considered in @xcite and compared it with the result of @xcite .",
    "the total correlation between the classical subsystem a and b can be defined by @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1(@xmath2 can be @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) is the shannon entropy of subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "if the probability distribution of the subsystem becomes @xmath5 , the shannon entropy is found to be @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the joint entropy of the total system composed of subsystem @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "when the probability distribution of the total system is known as @xmath8 , joint entropy is found to be @xmath9 .",
    "let us consider the quantum case .",
    "in quantum information one may consider the information of the quantum system as the quantum state corresponding to the system .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the quantum state to total system .",
    "then the quantum states of subsystem @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be found by @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the von neumann entropy of @xmath2 and the total subsystem are given by @xmath13(@xmath2 becomes @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "therefore the total correlation of the quantum case is expressed by @xmath15 total correlation given by eq(1 ) contains the classical and quantum correlation . therefore in order to extract the quantum correlation , one has to subtract the classical correlation from the total correlation .",
    "when one considers the positive operator valued measurement(povm ) @xmath16 on subsystem @xmath4 , the classical correlation can be defined by eq.(2)@xcite @xmath17    here @xmath18 is the state of subsystem @xmath3 , given as @xmath19 is the conditional entropy after measurement of subsystem @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the quantum correlation between subsystem @xmath3 and @xmath4 becomes@xcite @xmath20 this implies that optimizing eq.(3 ) is identical to find a measurement to minimize the conditional entropy @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath21 is unitary invariant@xcite .",
    "the x state which appears in various physical cases@xcite is known to persist under local noisy channel@xcite .",
    "the bell diagonal state and the werner state@xcite belong to the x state .",
    "the general form of subsystem @xmath10 in two qubit states becomes @xmath22 here @xmath23 is pauli s spin matrices and @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be found by @xmath26 without loss of generality , one may assume that all the parameters are real . by applying unitary operations to eq.(4 )",
    ", one can get the x state @xmath27 @xmath28 here , every element of @xmath27 is real . @xmath29 and @xmath30 satisfies @xmath31 .",

    "( 7 ) become @xmath35",
    "one may ask whether there exists an optimal povm for conditional entropy compared to projective measurement . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that projective measurement is the optimal condition for the 2 element povm .",
    "therefore , one should consider more than two elements povm . in @xcite",
    ", they found that there is x state where 3 element povm can be optimal . as is well known , it is very difficult to handle the optimal 3 element povm analytically .",
    "the general form of 3 element povm is expressed as @xcite @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the direction vector to @xmath38 . since , @xmath39 , the positivity of @xmath38 holds .",
    "when subsystem b is measured by @xmath40 , the post - measurement state @xmath18 of subsystem a becomes @xmath41/2 $ ] , where @xmath42 is a component of the @xmath43th element in the direction vector @xmath44 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath18 are @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is defined by @xmath47 the probability to obtain outcome @xmath43 turns out to be @xmath48 .",
    "therefore when 3 element povm is used for measurement , the conditional entropy @xmath21 can be found as @xmath49 here @xmath50 is a function defined as @xmath51 .",
    "the complete condition to @xmath40 becomes @xcite @xmath52 when there are three povm elements , the direction vector for each element forms a triangle .",
    "the shape of this triangle depends on @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "1 shows a triangle made by @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the xy plane .",
    "@xmath57 denotes the angle between the direction vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 . from eq.(12)-(13 ) one can obtain three equations to those angles @xmath60 from eq.(14 ) the relations between @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be given as @xmath63      the condition where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are real can be found from @xmath66 , which becomes eq.(16 ) .",
    "2 displays the region for @xmath67 where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are real .",
    "@xmath68 however , the measurement illustrated in fig .",
    "1 does not describe the most general povm . in order to indicate the most general povm one has to consider not the xy plane but an arbitrary plane .      therefore to find the direction vectors in an arbitrary plane , one can rotate them in fig .",
    "1 using the euler angle .",
    "the completeness holds under the rotation of the direction vectors .",
    "there are three rotation matrices in eq.(17 ) @xmath69 where each rotation matrices is @xmath70 the direction vector of fig .",
    "1 are @xmath71 . through rotation matrix @xmath72",
    ", one can obtain new direction vectors such as @xmath73 it is difficult to optimize eq.(11 ) analytically .",
    "therefore we use a monte - carlo simulation for optimizing eq.(11 ) .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "we randomly select @xmath74 in the region of fig .",
    "we examine a minimum conditional entropy in the region @xmath75 $ ] to the euler angle @xmath76 .",
    "it is found that a minimum conditional entropy does not depend on @xmath77 .",
    "in ref.@xcite they treated the quantum discord of the x state using projective measurement .",
    "one can see that the condition to the maximum of discord turns out to be @xmath80 .",
    "quantum discords for the x state of eq.(20 ) , eq.(21)@xcite and eq.(22)@xcite does not change dramatically according to the measurement setting .",
