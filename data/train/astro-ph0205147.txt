    "based on their characteristic period - luminosity ( pl ) relation , classical cepheids are primary indicators to estimate the distance to local group galaxies and to external galaxies with hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations . moreover , through the calibration of secondary distance indicators , they allow to study even more distant stellar systems , thus providing fundamental information on the hubble constant ( see ferrarese et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the pl relation is traditionally assumed to be independent of the chemical composition ( iben & renzini 1984 ; freedman & madore 1990 ) and cepheid distances are generally derived by adopting _",
    "universal _ multiband pl relations .",
    "the slope of these relations is the one derived for cepheids at the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , see madore & freedman 1991 ; udalski et al .",
    "1999 ) , whereas the zero - point is referenced to the lmc distance , as obtained with independent methods ( rr lyrae stars , red giant branch clump , sn1987a , etc : see , e.g. , freedman 1988 ; walker 1999 ; udalski et al . 1999 , and references therein ) or to calibrating cepheids in the galactic field ( feast & catchpole 1997 ;",

    ", we have deeply investigated the cepheid pulsational behavior through nonlinear , nonlocal and time - dependent convective pulsational models which take into account the coupling between pulsation and convection . with respect to linear nonadiabatic models ( e.g. , chiosi , wood & capitanio 1993 ;",
    "saio & gautschy 1998 ; alibert et al .",
    "1999 ) , such a theoretical approach allows improved predictions on the effective temperature of both the blue and red edges of the instability strip .",
    "in addition , they provide the amplitude and morphology of the light - curves all along the pulsation region ( see bono , marconi & stellingwerf 1999a , 2000 ; bono , castellani & marconi 2000 and references therein )",
    ". using fundamental models computed with three different chemical compositions ( @xmath3=0.25 , @xmath1=0.004 ; @xmath3=0.25 , @xmath1=0.008 ; @xmath3=0.28 , @xmath1=0.02 ) taken as representative of cepheids in the magellanic clouds and the galaxy , we have already shown that the predicted bolometric magnitude of metal - rich variables is , on average , fainter than that of metal - poor stars with the same period ( bono et al .",
    "furthermore , we found that both the slope and zero - point of synthetic pl relations at different wavelengths depend on the pulsator metallicity , with the amplitude of the metallicity effect decreasing from visual to near - infrared magnitudes ( caputo , marconi & musella 2000a ) .",
    "also the predicted period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relations at the different wavelengths turned out to be , in various degrees , metallicity dependent . as an example , for a given period and @xmath17 color , metal - rich pulsators are brighter than metal - poor ones , whereas they are fainter if the @xmath18 color is adopted ( caputo et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "the predicted pl relations in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands for the three selected chemical compositions have been applied by caputo et al .",
    "( 2000b ) to the cepheids observed within two hst surveys , the `` extragalactic distance scale key project '' ( freedman et al .",
    "1994 , hereafter kp ) and the `` type ia supernova calibration '' ( saha et al .",
    "1994 ) , in order to estimate the metallicity correction to the published distances . as a fact , both the hst projects adopt pl relations calibrated on cepheids at the lmc , namely on variables with @xmath19 0.008 ( see luck et al .",
    "1998 ) , whereas the metallicity of the hst observed cepheids can be significantly different from that of lmc cepheids .",
    "this in view of the fact that the range in the [ o / h ] metallicity index = log(o / h)@xmath20log(o / h)@xmath21 , with log(o / h)@xmath21=@xmath203.10 . ] covered by hii regions in the host galactic fields is @xmath22 @xmath200.7 to @xmath22 + 0.4 ( see ferrarese et al .",

( 2000b ) derived that the cepheid intrinsic distance modulus , as inferred by pulsating models , depends on the adopted metallicity as @xmath24log@xmath250.27 mag dex@xmath26 . assuming that the cepheid metal content scales with the field oxygen abundance , i.e. adopting @xmath27[o / h]@xmath28 $ ] , yields that the predicted metallicity correction ( in magnitude ) to the kp intrinsic distance modulus is @xmath29[o / h]@xmath300.27 mag dex@xmath26 , where @xmath27[o / h ] is the difference between the oxygen metallicity of the cepheid host galaxy whose distance we wish to determine and the lmc value .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the slope of the various predicted relations for fundamental pulsators with @xmath1=0.008 is in close agreement with the observed one for cepheids at the lmc ( see also caputo , marconi , & musella 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , the slope of the predicted linear pl@xmath31 and pl@xmath32 relations for cepheids with period log@xmath71.5 , as observed in the lmc , is @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see following section ) , respectively , in very good agreement with the values ( @xmath350.03 and @xmath360.02 ) inferred from the huge sample of lmc cepheids in the ogle - ii catalog ( udalski et al .",

    "2002 ) .",
    "however , in spite of these promising evidences , the disagreement with earlier empirical corrections made us quite uneasy .",
    "in fact , the analysis of cepheids in different fields of m31 ( freedman & madore 1990 ) and m101 ( kennicutt et al . 1998 ) suggests a null or even opposite metallicity effect ( see also kochanek 1997 ; sasselov et al .",
    "according to kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the direct application of the lmc - calibrated @xmath4 and @xmath5 pl relations to cepheids in the inner and outer fields in m101 yields a metallicity correction of @xmath29[o / h]@xmath370.24@xmath60.16 mag dex@xmath26 .",

    "looking for a possible way to explain the discrepancy between theory and observations , we note that the theoretical metallicity correction given in caputo et al .",
    "( 2000b ) refers to the explored metallicity range 0.004@xmath380.02 of the pulsating models , whereas the oxygen abundance of the m101 outer field is close to the lmc value and that of the inner field is @xmath22 0.7 dex larger , suggesting cepheid metal content of @xmath19 0.008 to @xmath22 0.04 , respectively . on this basis",
    ", we decided to explore the behavior of very metal rich ( @xmath10 0.02 ) pulsators with a view to improving on the predicted metallicity correction to the whole set of hst galaxies , whose [ o / h ] index ranges from @xmath230.7 to @xmath390.4  dex .",
    "moreover , as the helium abundance of the previous models was fixed following a primordial helium content @xmath40=0.23 and a relative helium - to - metal enrichment @xmath41  2.5 , we decided to analyze the effect of the simultaneous helium increase that is expected to become important for super - solar metal abundances .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we present the pulsation models , together with the results on the predicted instability strips .",
    "the implications for the pl and plc relations and the cepheid distance scale are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the conclusions close the paper .",
    "following the physical and numerical approach described in bono et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , we have computed new sets of nonlinear convective models with @xmath1=0.03 and @xmath1=0.04 .",
    "adopting @xmath40=0.23 and @xmath8=2.5 , the corresponding helium abundances are @xmath3=0.31 and @xmath3=0.33 , respectively . in order to investigate the effect of a variation of the helium abundance at fixed metallicity ,",
    "additional models with @xmath1=0.02 , @xmath3=0.31 and @xmath1=0.04 , @xmath3=0.39 ( corresponding to @xmath8=4 ) have been calculated .",
    "for all the computations , the adopted stellar masses are @xmath425 , 7 , 9 , and 11 , and for each stellar mass the luminosity level is fixed following the chemical composition dependent mass - luminosity ( ml ) relation provided by bono et al .",
    "the new ml relation is slightly different from the one adopted in our previous papers in the sense that at fixed mass it predicts slightly lower luminosities ( @xmath22 0.07 dex ) with respect to that adopted in our previous investigations .",
    "however , as a decrease in the luminosity reflects in a decrease in the pulsation period , we evaluate that the final effect on the pl and plc relations is of a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "finally , for each stellar mass , a wide range of effective temperature has been explored , leading to the predicted boundaries of the fundamental instability strip , as well as to the bolometric light curves all along the pulsation region , for each selected chemical composition .",
    "the intrinsic stellar parameters of the computed models are reported in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , together with the computed periods ( in days ) .",
    "the upper panel in fig .",
    "1 shows the hr diagram of the predicted instability strip for fundamental pulsators with @xmath1 in the range of 0.008 to 0.04 and helium abundance , according to @xmath2=2.5 , from @xmath3=0.25 to 0.33 , respectively .",
    "one has that as the metal content increases from @xmath1=0.008 to 0.03 , and accordingly @xmath3 increases from 0.25 to 0.31 , both the edges of the pulsation region move toward lower effective temperatures , leaving quite unchanged the width of the instability strip .",
    "a further increase from @xmath1=0.03 ( dashed line ) to 0.04 ( long - dashed line ) causes that the blue boundary moves towards the red whereas the red boundary shows an opposite behavior , with the final effect of narrowing the pulsation region .",
    "this last evidence is a result of the decreased pulsation driving associated to the hydrogen ionization region , as due to the decreased hydrogen abundance from @xmath43=0.66 to 0.62 .",
    "in fact , since the earlier investigations by baker & kippenhan ( 1965 ) , unno ( 1965 ) , christy ( 1962 ) , cox et al .",
    "( 1965 ) it has become clear that the pulsation driving associated to the h ionization region can be comparable with the one associated to the second helium ionization region .",
    "more recently , bono et al .",
    "( 1999a ) have shown that the contribution of the h ionization region to the pulsation driving of classical cepheids is expected to become dominant in particular regions of the instability strip .",
    "the significant reduction of the h content , as due to the simultaneous increase of helium and metal abundances , causes a decrease in the local driving supplied by this zone , reducing the pulsation efficiency and , in turn , the width of the instability strip .    the lower panel in fig .",
    "1 shows the instability strip for pulsators with @xmath1=0.02 and @xmath3=0.31 ( @xmath44 , dashed - dotted line ) in comparison with the results at fixed metal content ( @xmath1=0.02 and @xmath3=0.28 , solid line ) and helium abundance ( @xmath1=0.03 and @xmath3=0.31 , dashed line ) . for fixed he abundance , one has that the effect of a larger @xmath1 is to move the instability strip towards the red . on the contrary ,",
    "for fixed @xmath1 , an increased @xmath3 moves the pulsation region towards higher effective temperatures , mainly at the higher luminosity levels . as a result ,",
    "the pulsation region with @xmath1=0.02 and @xmath3=0.31 turns out to be much more close to the predicted one for lmc variables ( @xmath1=0.008 , dotted line ) .",
    "eventually , the full set of pulsating models provides clear evidence that the location of the cepheid instability strip in the hr diagram _ depends on both the helium and metal content of the pulsators_.    one agrees that , if @xmath15 0.01 , a variation of @xmath8 in the range 2 to 4 does not significantly modify the helium content , and in turn the expected pulsational behavior , whereas with @xmath45 0.02 the effect becomes more and more important . on this subject ,",
    "it is worth noticing that no pulsation model results to be unstable with @xmath1=0.04 and @xmath3=0.39 , i.e. @xmath46 , as a consequence of the extreme reduction of the hydrogen abundance ( @xmath43=0.57 ) . on the other hand , bono et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have recently shown that the evolution in the hr diagram of intermediate - mass stars with @xmath1=0.04 is strongly dependent on he abundances .",
    "in particular , an increase from @xmath3=0.29 to 0.37 causes a decrease in the temperature excursion of the blue - loop , with the consequent lower probability to cross the cepheid instability strip , and/or a reduction in the time spent inside the instability strip .",
    "thus , independent pulsational and evolutionary results seem to provide an upper limit of @xmath16 3.5 for the detection of super metal - rich ( @xmath1=0.04 ) cepheids .    before closing this section ,",
    "we wish also mention that the predicted relations based on pulsating models are still affected by non negligible systematic effects .",
    "it has been recently shown ( caputo et al .",
    "2001 ; bono , castellani , & marconi 2002 ) that the canonical assumptions on both the mass - luminosity relation and the mixing length parameter should be revised .",
    "however , these variations are expected to mainly affect the zero points of theoretical relations , leaving the results about the dependence on chemical composition almost unchanged .",
    "on the basis of the results discussed in the previous section , we can investigate the combined effects of metal and helium abundances on the cepheid pl and plc relations .",
    "to this aim , the bolometric light curves of the computed models were transformed into the observational bands @xmath47 by means of the atmosphere models published by castelli , gratton & kurucz ( 1997a , b ) and specifically computed by castelli ( private communication ) for super - solar chemical compositions .",
    "the transformed light curves were used to derive the intensity averaged mean magnitudes and colors presented in tables 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the predicted multiband plc relations for all the computed models with the various chemical compositions are reported in table 4 . as for the pl relations , which are well known to depend on the topology of the instability strip and on the distribution of pulsators within the strip",
    ", we did not use the individual models but we populated the predicted instability strip by adopting the procedure suggested by kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and already used by caputo et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "in particular , 1000 pulsators were uniformly distributed from the blue to the red boundary of the instability strip , with a mass law as given by @xmath48 over the mass range 5 - 11@xmath49 ( see caputo et al .",
    "2000a for further details ) .",
    "the resulting synthetic multiband ( @xmath47 ) pl relations are given in table 5 and table 6 ( quadratic and linear solutions , respectively ) .",
    "we have already shown in previous papers ( bono et al .",
    "1999b ; caputo et al .",
    "2000a ) that moving toward the shorter wavelengths the @xmath50-log@xmath51 distribution of fundamental pulsators with periods longer than @xmath22 3 days is much better represented by a quadratic relation . on the observational side ,",
    "some hints have been presented by sandage & tammann ( 1968 ) and sasselov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who state `` cepheids with @xmath9 50 days are expected ( and observed ) to deviate from a linear pl relation '' .",
    "moreover , we wish to recall that , as discussed in ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the distance modulus of the kp galaxies increases when the lower period cut - off is moved from 10 to 20 - 25 days , suggesting that the adopted lmc - referenced linear pl relations are over - estimating the absolute magnitudes of cepheids in the long - period range . on the other hand ,",
    "the almost perfectly linear pl relations provided by the huge number of cepheids in the lmc is consistent with the theoretical results . as discussed by caputo , marconi & musella ( 2002 ) , if only models with periods shorter than log@xmath51=1.5 are considerd in the final fit , then reliable linear solutions are obtained , with the slope of the predicted linear pl@xmath31 and pl@xmath32 relations with @xmath1=0.008 as given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , in very good agreement with the observed values ( @xmath350.03 and @xmath360.02 ) inferred from the lmc cepheids in the ogle - ii catalog ( udalski et al .",
    "1999 ) . for the above reasons , the quadratic solutions in table 5 hold for pulsators with log@xmath52 0.5 , while the linear solutions in table 6 should be applied only with log@xmath7 1.5 .",
    "figure 2 shows the behavior of the linear pl@xmath31 ( top panel ) and pl@xmath32 ( bottom panel ) relations with @xmath8=2.5 in comparison with the results at solar metallicity and @xmath8=4 . adopting @xmath53 , the slope of the predicted relations decreases , and the predicted magnitudes at fixed period get fainter , as the metal content increases from @xmath1=0.008 ( solid line ) to 0.02 ( dotted line ) and 0.03 ( dashed line ) .",
    "however , as already noticed for the instability strip location in the hr diagram ( see bottom panel in fig .",
    "1 ) , the pl relations at solar metal abundance become steeper when the helium content increases from @xmath3=0.28 to 0.31 ( long - dashed line ) , moving towards the predicted relations for lmc cepheids ( @xmath1=0.008 , @xmath3=0.25 ) .",
    "this is an important point because the difference between the pl relations of galactic and lmc cepheids is a debated issue in the recent literature .",
    "current results seem to suggest that the combined metallicity and helium abundance effects have to be taken into account in order to properly address this problem .",
    "we are now on condition to evaluate the corrections to lmc - calibrated true distance moduli , by taking into account the predicted combined effect of metallicity and helium abundance on the cepheid distance scale .",
    "a straight estimate can be made by considering our models with the various chemical compositions as real cepheids at the fixed distance @xmath54=0 mag .",
    "then , using the predicted linear relations with @xmath1=0.008 and @xmath3=0.25 we determine the value @xmath55 for all the pulsators . in view of the fact that hst observations are in the two bands @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we concentrate on these pl relations and , according to the kp method",
    ", we adopt @xmath56 and @xmath57/@xmath58=1.54 from the cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction model .",
    "in such a way , we are mimicking the kp procedure and the derived @xmath55 values provide directly the effects of chemical composition on the distance moduli inferred from lmc - calibrated @xmath4 and @xmath5 pl relations .    figure 3 shows the resulting mean values @xmath55 as a function of the metal content for the pulsators with @xmath59/@xmath60=2.5 ( circles ) and 4 ( triangles ) .",
    "given the different slope of the predicted pl relations , the discrepancy between @xmath55 and the real value ( @xmath54=0 mag ) depends on the pulsator period . as shown in the upper panel in fig .",
    "3 , from 3 to @xmath22 10 days ( open circles ) , the discrepancy is quite small , thus supporting the adoption of _ universal lmc - referenced pl linear relations within this period range_. for periods in the range 20 - 30 days ( filled circles ) , the effects become significant in the metallicity range of @xmath19 0.013 to 0.032 , where the adoption of the @xmath1=0.008 linear relations yields pulsators spuriously brighter by more than 0.1 mag . in particular , for pulsators with @xmath1= 0.02 and @xmath3=0.28 we determine @xmath61 0.20 mag .",
    "finally , the data plotted in the bottom panel in fig . 3 show that for very long periods ( @xmath9 30 days , open circles ) the value of @xmath55 is larger than 0.1 mag over the range @xmath19 0.01 to 0.04 , reaching @xmath22 0.30 mag with @xmath1=0.02 and @xmath3=0.28 .",
    "however , we have shown in the lower panel in fig .",
    "1 that an increased helium abundance causes the @xmath1=0.02 pulsators to become bluer , moving the instability strip towards the predicted location with @xmath1=0.008 . as a consequence ( see also fig .",
    "2 ) , the adoption of the @xmath1=0.008 linear relations for pulsators with @xmath1=0.02 and @xmath3=0.31 ( corresponding to @xmath8=4 ) yields @xmath61 0.05 , 0.09 , and 0.15 mag for the short ( open triangle in the upper panel ) , long ( filled triangle ) , and very long period period range ( open triangle in the bottom panel ) , respectively .",
    "on this basis , we estimate that lmc - calibrated linear pl relations might be safely adopted , with an uncertainty of @xmath60.1 mag , for cepheids in the short period range ( @xmath7 10 days ) , at least for @xmath0 0.04 and @xmath8=3@xmath61 .",
    "those relations might be used also for cepheids with periods in the range 20 - 30 days , on condition that @xmath8 is high enough ( @xmath623 ) .",
    "unfortunately , current estimates of the @xmath8 ratio are still disappointingly uncertain , either in the milky way or in external galaxies . as a matter of fact , from extragalactic hii regions lequeux et al .",

    "as for the results from main - sequence nearby stars , the global estimate is 3@xmath62 ( see pagel & portinari 2000 ) . in this context , since the cepheids observed in hst galaxies , and in faraway galaxies as well , are generally in the long period range , we use the whole set of pulsating models with log@xmath9 1.0 to estimate the average correction ( in magnitude ) to @xmath55 as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath1 .    with metallicity larger than @xmath1=0.008 we get the following analytical relation @xmath63 with a r.m.s . of 0.05 mag , whereas fr @xmath15 0.008 we get @xmath64 note that these corrections hold only in the framework of the kp method , i.e. they apply to distance moduli inferred from lmc - based @xmath4 and @xmath5 linear pl relations , according to the procedure discussed above .",

    "specifically , the `` turn - over '' metallicity @xmath68 increases from @xmath22 0.016 to 0.025 as @xmath65/@xmath60 decreases from 3.5 to 2.0 ; _ ii _ ) - if lmc - calibrated pl relations are used , then cepheids with 0.008@xmath69 result spuriously brighter and , consequently , the lmc - based distance modulus may require a @xmath70 correction whose amount increases for larger @xmath1 ( at fixed @xmath8 ) and lower helium - to - hydrogen ratio ( at fixed @xmath1 ) ; _ iii _ ) - this behavior is reversed when the cepheid metallicity is larger than @xmath68 , and eventually the lmc - based distance modulus of metal - rich cepheids may need a @xmath71 correction whose amount increases for larger @xmath1 ( at fixed @xmath8 ) and higher helium - to - hydrogen ratio ( at fixed @xmath1 ) ; _ iv _ ) - depending on @xmath65/@xmath60 , very metal - rich ( @xmath19 0.04 ) cepheids may appear spuriously brighter or fainter .",
