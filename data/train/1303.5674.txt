    "it is already known for some time that gigantic magnetic fields occurred during the cosmological electroweak phase transition @xcite , but recently , it has also become clear that magnetic fields up to @xmath4 tesla can occur shortly during relativistic heavy ion collisions , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "to put such a field strength in the correct perspective , a magnetar , or highly magnetized neutron star , reaches `` merely '' @xmath5 tesla .",
    "the interest in qcd studies under these extreme conditions has therefore increased considerably . as strong coupling effects are relevant in the setting of interest",
    ", we must rely on nonperturbative tools to study the relatively new realm of qcd physics in a strong magnetic background .",
    "this has initiated a vast amount of original research , let us refer to @xcite and references therein for a recent review",
    ". in particular , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are two typical nonperturbative qcd effects that can be affected .",
    "it is common knowledge that qcd deconfines at a certain temperature @xmath6 , while chiral symmetry is restored at @xmath7 .",
    "we shall be concerned with qcd in the chiral limit here , i.e.  we ignore the bare quark masses , in which case a clear - cut chiral transition exists . in real life qcd , with massive dynamical flavours , only approximate order parameters can be defined for both chiral restoration ( @xmath8 chiral condensates ) and deconfinement ( @xmath8 polyakov loop ) , leading to cross - over behaviour rather than sharp phase transitions .",
    "once a hot debate whether @xmath6 and @xmath7 coincided or not , see @xcite for 2 views on the @xmath9 case , it is by now accepted they are close in the cross - over region .",
    "these results were obtained using lattice simulations , a powerful ally to access the nonperturbative qcd sector .",
    "more recently , a vivid discussion evolved around the possibility that @xmath6 and @xmath7 separate under the influence of a constant magnetic background field , @xmath10 , and this for @xmath0 qcd , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath0 lattice results of @xcite indicated a weak rise in the transition temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 , both remained compatible with each other ( a split of @xmath11 ) , while the various analytical model based results were inconclusive on the matter , as different results were obtained per qcd model @xcite . somewhat later , a more thorough lattice study appeared using @xmath9 flavours with physical masses , leading to a much more complicated behaviour in the chiral / deconfinement ( pseudo-)order parameters and ensuing critical temperatures @xcite .",
    "it was motivated that the reported behaviour where contrasting with the results of @xcite should be traced back to the lighter dynamical flavours and partially also to the present strange flavour , as the up ( @xmath12 ) and down ( @xmath13 ) quark of @xcite were considerably heavier . soon after , the first analytical papers appeared trying to explain the state - of - the art lattice data using backreacting pion dynamics @xcite .",
    "the naive reason for expecting a split between @xmath6 and @xmath7 was the expected enhancement of chiral symmetry breaking due to a magnetic field the so - called chiral magnetic catalysis @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite showed a more subtle picture : the magnetic catalysis was confirmed for temperatures ( sufficiently ) below @xmath6 , but for larger temperatures the ( averaged over up and down ) chiral condensate displayed a non - monotonous shape , a feature translated into a similar behaviour in the transition temperature .",
    "this observation of an `` inverse magnetic catalysis '' seems to depend crucially on taking into account quark backreaction effects , see also @xcite , so we do not expect it to appear in the unquenched sakai - sugimoto setting we will use .    since a magnetic field couples to the up and down flavours with another strength ,",
    "as they carry different electric charges , it seems natural that the up and down chiral restoration temperatures can be different , as well as the magnetic catalysis itself .",
    "we recall that the classical chiral structure of qcd with and without magnetic field is different , since coupling a magnetic field to the quarks reduces @xmath14 to @xmath15^u\\times \\left[u(1)_l\\times u(1)_r\\right]^d$ ] , so that the eventually broken chiral invariances @xmath16 and @xmath17 can experience a different restoration temperature .",
    "lattice simulations indeed confirm a larger value for the @xmath18 than for the @xmath19 chiral condensate at @xmath20 @xcite , as does the @xmath0 nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "it would appear natural that @xmath21 should consequently be larger than @xmath22 .",
    "the splitting of degenerate order parameters , like @xmath18 and @xmath19 at @xmath23 , when an external field is switched on , is not that unfamiliar . in certain exotic superconductors , e.g.  @xmath24",
    ", a similar phenomenon occurs @xcite .    here",
    ", we will use the gauge - gravity duality , a powerful tool to analytically study certain aspects of strongly coupled gauge theories @xcite , to shed further light on the possible @xmath25 qcd phase diagram .",
    "in particular , we rely on the non - antipodal sakai - sugimoto model ( ssm ) @xcite with 2 quenched flavours , represented by two d8-@xmath26 probe brane - antibrane pairs , in the chiral limit and with 3 colours .",
    "going beyond the quenched approximation and/or including massive dynamical flavours leads to utter complications @xcite .",
    "we take into due account the different coupling of up and down flavour to the magnetic field , leading to a different probe brane geometry per flavour .",
    "we compare our findings with the lattice results of @xcite .",
    "although those results are referring to two - colour qcd , it contains an extrapolation to the chiral limit , which is the closest the available lattice results come to the @xmath0 ssm colours to get explicit numbers , where in principle the limit @xmath27 is always understood at the holographic level . setting @xmath28 or @xmath29 will not induce any qualitative change in the ssm results . ] . in @xcite , no manifest split between @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "was reported , whilst the chiral condensate increases monotonically with the applied magnetic field for all temperatures in the confinement phase .",
    "we do present similar results here using prefixed values for the string theory parameters of the ssm . with prefixed ,",
    "we mean that a few physical qcd input values at zero magnetic field are chosen to match the corresponding ssm predictions .",
    "these results are a generalization to the 2 flavour case of the single flavour analysis of @xcite . to extend the scope of our analysis",
    ", we will also allow that the asymptotic d8-@xmath26 separation @xmath2 or equivalently , the confinement scale @xmath30 can vary and as such we construct the magnetic generalization of the @xmath3 phase diagram of figure 7 in the original work @xcite concerning the ssm phase diagram .",
    "all results are presented in gev units to make comparison with other qcd approaches more direct .",
    "at zero temperature , the ssm @xcite involves a system of @xmath31 pairs of @xmath32-@xmath26 flavour probe branes placed in the d4-brane background @xmath33 where @xmath34 , with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) the string constant ( length ) .",
    "there is a natural cut - off at @xmath37 , which ensures confinement in the dual field theory living at the boundary @xmath38 .",
    "a smooth cut - off is realized if @xmath39 has a periodicity @xmath40 with @xmath30 the compactification scale .",
    "a @xmath41 gauge theory resides on the stack of coinciding @xmath32-@xmath26 flavour pairs , which corresponds to the global chiral symmetry in the dual qcd - like theory .",
    "the cigar - shape of the ( @xmath42)-subspace of the d4-brane background forces the embedding of the flavour branes to be @xmath43-shaped , which signals the breaking of chiral symmetry @xmath44 as the merging of the d8-branes and @xmath26-branes at the value @xmath45 .",
    "the value @xmath46 is directly related to the asymptotic separation @xmath2 ( at @xmath47 ) between d8- and @xmath26-branes , indicated in figure [ ss ] . for values of @xmath46 greater than or equal to @xmath48",
    "the embedding is respectively non - antipodal or antipodal .",
    "at finite temperature there are two regular euclidean backgrounds with the same asymptotic geometry that compete with each other in the partition function , the wick - rotated version of the d4-brane background and a black d4-brane background @xcite .",
    "the wick - rotated d4-brane background has a cigar - shaped @xmath49-subspace and a cilinder - shaped @xmath50-subspace , with the periodicity of the @xmath51-circle arbitrary and equal to the inverse temperature , @xmath52 , and the periodicity of the @xmath39-circle fixed to @xmath53 , while the black d4-brane background @xmath54 has a cigar - shaped @xmath50-subspace and a cilinder - shaped @xmath49-subspace , now with the periodicity of the @xmath39-circle arbitrary , but the periodicity of the @xmath51-circle fixed to @xmath55 .",
    "these two backgrounds are identical , modulo a redefinition of coordinates @xmath51 and @xmath39 , when @xmath56 equals @xmath57 , which happens at the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath58 . in the deconfining phase phase diagram , see fig",
    ". 10 of @xcite , gives a qualitatively similar result as the ` old ' ssm .",
    "based on this observation , we can expect that qualitative features of the @xmath59-dependence of the chiral transition temperatures are not unlikely to be similar in both backgrounds . it would be interesting to check this explicitly , but for the reasons mentioned above we will consider the simpler black d4-brane background in this paper .",
    "we thank takeshi morita for discussion on this point . ]",
    "the embedding of the flavour branes is no longer forced to be @xmath43-shaped , as the @xmath49-space is no longer cigar - shaped .",
    "at a certain value of the temperature , @xmath60 , it will become energetically favourable for the flavour branes to fall straight down instead of merging in a @xmath43-shape , indicating chiral symmetry restoration ( see figure  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "the essential features of qcd , chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , plus the ensuing chiral restoration and deconfinement at sufficiently large temperatures are thus nicely resembled by the ssm , amongst other qcd phenomenology @xcite . to make further explicit contact with qcd",
    ", we determine the string related parameters of the ssm in physical ( gev ) units , so that an explicit comparison with other approaches comes within range .",
    "in @xcite the independent parameters @xmath30 and @xmath61 of the antipodal ( @xmath62 ) ssm were fixed to @xmath63 gev and @xmath64 , with @xmath65 the t hooft coupling , by matching to the qcd input values @xmath66 for the pion decay constant @xmath67 and the @xmath68 meson mass @xmath69 . due to the relations @xmath70 , @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath72 @xcite all other parameters of the model are then fixed as well .",
    "note that throughout this paper we set @xmath73    in the non - antipodal case ( @xmath74 ) the matching conditions ( [ fixing ] ) do not fix all freedom , since there is one extra parameter present , @xmath46 . from the eigenvalue equation which determines @xmath69 holographically ,",
    "@xmath75 with @xmath76 we extract the values of @xmath46 that , for a given @xmath30 , lead to @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting function @xmath78 is plotted in figure  [ parameters ] for a range of @xmath30 the maximum value of @xmath30 corresponding to the limiting case @xmath79 alongside with the function @xmath80 for the corresponding asymptotic separation between branes and anti - branes , determined from @xmath81 with @xmath82 denoted as @xmath83 .",
    "next , demanding that the ssm - prediction for the pion decay constant @xcite , @xmath84 equals @xmath85 gev , leads to the function @xmath86 of allowed values for @xmath61 , as plotted in figure  [ c ] .",
    "the string tension @xmath87 is then also known as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "the remaining freedom of choosing the mass scale @xmath30 can be fixed for example by matching the ssm - prediction for the constituent quark mass , @xmath88 to a phenomenologically reasonable value , as can be read off from figure  [ mqmk ] .",
    "in @xcite we opted to reproduce @xmath89 gev , leading to the following set of fixed holographic parameters : @xmath90 with these values , the effective qcd string tension is computed to be @xmath91 @xcite , in excellent agreement with the standard lattice value , @xmath92-@xmath93 , extracted from @xcite .",
    "said otherwise , we could equally well have selected the string tension as our third qcd input value instead of the constituent quark mass .    here",
    ", we will however opt to leave @xmath30 variable , or equivalently @xmath2 via figure  [ b ] , with the eye on drawing the @xmath1 phase diagram later , and , more importantly , with the idea that the choice of @xmath30 or @xmath2 should be left free , as it determines the choice of holographic theory : @xmath2 very small ( @xmath8 @xmath94 large @xmath95 small ) corresponding to an njl - type boundary field theory @xcite versus @xmath96 maximal ( @xmath95 maximal ) corresponding to a maximal probing of the gluon background , i.e.  the original antipodal ssm .",
    "the next step is to introduce a magnetic background .",

    ", one can slightly gauge the global @xmath110 symmetry in the boundary field theory , i.e.  make @xmath111 @xmath112-dependent , so that @xmath113 corresponds to adding a background @xmath110 field .",
    "working in the @xmath114 gauge , the flavour gauge field can then be expanded as @xcite @xmath115 where  rest \" refers to pions and vector mesons in the boundary qcd theory , which are irrelevant for the current purposes .",
    "an electromagnetic background field @xmath116 can be switched on through @xmath117 with @xmath118 the charge matrix for the up- and down - quarks .",
    "the choice @xmath119 , or @xmath120 , @xmath121 , ensures the desired constant magnetic background @xmath122 .",
    "the corresponding field strength tensor reads @xmath123",
    "for completeness , we briefly summarize here the discussion of the @xmath59-dependent embedding of the @xmath0 flavour branes in the confinement phase , i.e. the determination of @xmath124 for each flavour , presented in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the induced metric on the flavour branes is given by @xmath125 where the metric components in flavour space are assumed to be different , to allow for a different response of both flavour branes to the magnetic field : @xmath126 with the @xmath12-coordinate appearing in @xmath127 , resp .",

    "the dbi - action for the two d8-branes thus reduces to the sum of two abelian actions , which is the geometric translation of the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry @xmath137 .    suppressing the @xmath134-index for the moment",
    ", @xmath138 can be determined from the conserved `` hamiltonians '' @xmath139 by assuming @xmath43-shaped embeddings , @xmath140 at @xmath141 ( with @xmath142 and @xmath82 denoted as @xmath143 and @xmath83 , for each flavour ) . in the confinement phase ,",
    "the @xmath59-dependent action on each flavour brane is then given by @xmath144 and the asymptotic separations @xmath145 become ( suppressing @xmath134 for notational convenience ) @xmath146    to model magnetic catalysis , we keep @xmath147 fixed , for each flavour , at its flavour - independent value @xmath2 for @xmath23 . from the viewpoint of the boundary field theory ,",
    "the flavour branes are extensive objects that stretch out infinitely far , viz .  from @xmath148 to @xmath149 into the higher - dimensional bulk space .",
    "as such , from this asymptotic perspective , it would appear that it would cost an infinite amount of energy to move the branes at @xmath148 .",
    "keeping @xmath2 fixed thus seems to be a sensible boundary condition , one also used in e.g.  @xcite , to probe the effects of the bulk dynamics in the presence of the external field .",
    "the value of @xmath2 , ranging from @xmath150 to negligible w.r.t .",
    "@xmath150 , determines how much of the bulk dynamics is probed , ranging respectively from all to none .",
    "so , as we keep @xmath151 fixed to its value @xmath2 at zero magnetic field , from here on also explicitly writing the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath151 through @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we can extract the @xmath59-dependence of @xmath46 and of the corresponding constituent quark masses @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which correspond to the mass ( [ mq ] ) of a string stretched between one of the flavour branes and the cut - off at @xmath70 @xcite : @xmath156 using the correspondence between @xmath2 and @xmath30 as plotted in figure  [ b ] such that @xmath157 gev , we obtain @xmath158 or @xmath159 .",
    "this turns out to be a rising function of @xmath59 for all choices of @xmath30 or @xmath2 , modeling chiral magnetic catalysis , as already noted in @xcite for the single - flavour case .",
    "the magnetic field thus indeed boosts the chiral symmetry breaking , reflected in a stronger bending of the flavour branes , and the breaking is stronger for the up- than for the down - flavour , see figure [ embeddingba ] .",
    "this was expected , since the up - quark couples twice as strong to the magnetic field . for the particular choice of parameters ( [ values ] ) ,",
    "@xmath160 is plotted in figure  [ embeddingbb ] .",
    "both constituent masses show a quadratic dependence on @xmath59 for small magnetic fields , which then becomes nearly linear , and eventually thrives to saturation at very large @xmath59 .",
    "this linear behaviour is in relative agreement with recent lattice estimates of the chiral condensate in @xcite .",
    "a linear behaviour , inspired by chiral perturbation theory , was fitted to the su(2 ) lattice data for the chiral condensate in @xcite , while su(3 ) data was fitted with a @xmath161 behaviour in @xcite ; both these studies used 1 quenched flavour .",
    "let us however point out that the plots of the lattice chiral condensates in all cited works do seem to display a nontrivial curvature for small values of @xmath59 .",
    "the stability of the flavour branes embedding as shown in figure  [ embeddingba ] is discussed in @xcite . at sufficiently low values of @xmath59 ,",
    "it is stable , but at higher values of @xmath59 , we should not necessarily trust our findings , as an instability could occur in the @xmath68 meson sector at @xmath162 , driving a condensation @xcite .",
    "evidently , this would lead to a different underlying action , describing the theory in the condensed phase .",
    "if this happens , also other models should take it into account .",
    "next , we turn to the finite temperature case .",
    "the background at @xmath163 is identical to the zero temperature background up to the period @xmath52 of euclidean time , so nothing changes as compared to the @xmath20 case .",
    "things get more interesting once we enter the deconfinement region .",
    "we again have an induced metric on each flavour brane , @xmath164 du^2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with periodicity of the @xmath51-circle given by @xmath165 from which one can determine the action in the deconfined phase , completely analogous to the derivation of the action in the confined phase . for temperatures @xmath166 , the @xmath134-brane s embedding remains @xmath43-shaped , with action @xmath167 where @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 . if @xmath173 , the @xmath134-branes are falling straight down , @xmath174 , with action @xmath175 the chiral transition temperature @xmath176 is the temperature for which @xmath177 becomes zero @xcite , with @xmath178 the correspondence between @xmath179 and @xmath2 in the deconfined phase is modified into ( again suppressing the flavour index here ) @xmath180    as before , we will hold the asymptotic separation fixed at its starting value @xmath2 at @xmath23 and @xmath20 .",

    "this regime is probably the least physically relevant , as the values for constituent quark masses are too large and the values for the deconfinement temperature smaller than 0.105 gev , which is rather small compared to the chiral limit value we can extrapolate `` by hand '' from @xcite , giving @xmath214 .",
    "the third possible case is that the value of @xmath30 is such , 0.657 gev @xmath215 gev ( @xmath216 gev @xmath217 gev or 1.473 gev@xmath218 gev@xmath208 ) , that @xmath219 but a split between @xmath7 and @xmath6 arises at some value of @xmath59 , plotted in figure  [ bcm ] .",

    "a deconfinement temperature @xmath222 gev would correspond to @xmath223 gev , very close to the antipodal value so in the regime where no split arises between @xmath7 and @xmath6 , leading however to an unphysically small @xmath224 gev .",
    "the papers @xcite also pointed out the splitting of the critical temperatures for the one flavour version of the ssm , but leaving the parameters of the ssm undetermined , making an explicit comparison with other approaches harsh .",
    "the explicit breaking of the global flavour symmetry by the different electromagnetic coupling of the up and down flavour is also now taken into account for the first time , leading to a split between the two chiral transitions themselves .",
    "the fact that a split between @xmath7 and @xmath6 can emerge only for sufficiently small values of the asymptotic brane separation @xmath2 , i.e. sufficiently close to an njl effective description of qcd , seems to be supported by njl model calculations @xcite , see also the discussions in @xcite , that seemingly contrast with lattice data . selecting the holographic parameters in a way that brings the ssm as close as possible to ( the chiral limit of ) qcd , rather leads to a picture of the form of figure  [ t7209 ] or [ t77 ] , namely no split at all or a small split that only emerges at rather large values of @xmath59 .",
    "our findings are in this perspective consistent with lattice data of @xcite , where a split was neither reported .",

    "we can conclude that the antipodal sakai - sugimoto model is unable to capture the magnetically induced explicit breaking of chiral symmetry , as well as the chiral magnetic catalysis .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement coincide for all values of the magnetic field .",

    "the value of @xmath2 , i.e. the choice of the type of boundary model in a sense , determines if a split between the chiral and deconfinement temperature may or may not arise , as summarized in figure  [ tchicrosssections ] . due to the different coupling to the magnetic background of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 flavour brane , we also find a split between the separate chiral transition temperatures .",
    "it remains a challenge to construct a holographic dual of realistic qcd that could also describe the complicated finite temperature ( above and below @xmath6 ) behaviour of the chiral condensate as found in the latest lattice results @xcite .",
    "this would require taking backreaction of the flavour branes on the background metric into account .",
    "a holographic model that could be interesting to look at from this point of view , is the kuperstein - sonnenschein model @xcite , in which chiral magnetic catalysis was observed @xcite in the non - backreacted case , and which was extended to include backreaction ( be it perturbatively and for vanishing magnetic field ) in @xcite , using a smearing technique .",
    "a downside of this model is however that it does not incorporate confinement due to the choice of the background in which the flavour branes are placed .",
    "we end by noticing that the magnetic phase diagram could become even more intricate , as demonstrated in @xcite : the qcd vacuum could become superconducting at sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "this matter is currently under investigation also in the holographic framework , see also @xcite .",
    "we hope the presented results will stimulate further research in the area of qcd in a strong magnetic background , where many exciting new physics could be awaiting discovery .",
    "the gauge - gravity correspondence can offer viable input , next to qcd model and lattice based approaches .",
