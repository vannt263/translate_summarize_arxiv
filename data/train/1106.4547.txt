    "the colour  magnitude relation ( cmr ) is usually understood as a mass  metallicity relation : more luminous and massive galaxies in this relation have deep potential wells capable of retaining the metal content released by supernovae events and stellar winds .",
    "generally , a linear relation has been used to fit the correlation between luminosity and colour of cluster galaxies lying in the cmr . however ,",
    "different fits have been suggested ( e.g. janz & lisker 2009 ) , consistent with a change of slope from the bright to the faint ends . additional evidence of a tilt towards bluer colours at the bright end of the cmr arises from studies of large samples of early - type galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( baldry et al .",
    "2006 , skelton et al .",
    "this observed trend has been reproduced by skelton et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using a simplified model in which dry mergers of galaxies already on the cmr mildly change the slope of this relation at higher luminosities .",
    "this detachment of the bright end of the cmr , motivates our study .",
    "we use a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution that includes the effect of feedback active galactic nuclei ( lagos et al .",
    "2008 ) , and an improved estimation of the scalelength of galactic discs ( tecce et al .",
    "our aim is to explain how minor mergers influence the evolution of the most massive galaxies in the cmr , since several authors consider dry mergers as the prime candidates to account for the strong mass and size evolution of the stellar spheroids at @xmath0 , and they are supposed to increase the stellar mass of galaxies , without changing the colours ( bernardi et al .",
    "we extend the study performed by jimnez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , considering two sets of simulated galaxy clusters , c14 and c15 , with virial masses in the ranges @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ( see dolag et al .",
    "2005 for details ) , and construct the cmrs in three different colour  magnitude planes .",
    "minimum square fits to the simulated cmrs are estimated in each magnitude system , for all clusters .",
    "the average slopes of these fits are @xmath3 in the @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 plane , @xmath6 in the @xmath7 vs. @xmath8 plane ( @xmath5 and @xmath8 magnitudes are in the cousins system ) , and @xmath9 in the @xmath10 vs. @xmath11 plane ( washington photometric system ) .",
    "we compare these slopes with observed ones . in the @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 plane , lpez - cruz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) studied the cmrs of 57 low - redshift cluster galaxies , obtaining an average slope of @xmath12 . for the @xmath10 vs. @xmath11 plane ,",
    "smith castelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , obtained the cmr of early - type galaxies in the antlia cluster using the washington photometric system .",
    "this cmr is characterized by @xmath13 .",
    "these slopes , as well as those observed in the @xmath7 vs. @xmath14 plane , are in concordance with our findings ( see jimnez et al . , in prep . ) allowing us to conclude that the model reproduces very well the cmrs in different colour  magnitude planes .",
    "we find an interesting aspect from our simulations . in all colour",
    " magnitude planes , the most massive and luminous galaxies present a detachment from the general trend denoted by fainter galaxies . this break occurs at approximately the same magnitude in the different filters ( @xmath15 ) , being more evident in the washington t1 . in order to understand the physical reasons that lead to the bluer colours of the brightest galaxies in our simulations , we divide the simulated cmr at @xmath16 in bins of one magnitude from @xmath17 to @xmath18 and analyze the evolution of mass and metallicity of the stellar component contributed by different processes : quiescent star formation ( qsf ) and starbursts during major wet , major dry , minor wet and minor dry mergers , and disc instability ( di ) events ( for details on the classification of these processes in our model , see jimnez et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution with redshift of the accumulated mass contributed by different sets of processes ( qsf and di : left panel ; minor mergers : middle panel ) normalized to the total stellar mass acquired within each magnitude bin . in this way",
    ", we have an estimation of the relative importance of these processes on the formation of galaxies with different luminosities .",
    "it can be seen that for a set of very luminous galaxies ( @xmath19 ) , the mass fraction contributed by qsf and di decreases at low redshifts ( from @xmath20 ) as the galaxy is being formed .",
    "note that values larger than unity are reached because the total stellar mass of galaxies is reduced as a result of mass recycled by the stellar population due to mass loss and dying stars , following the whole evolution traced by the semianalytic code ; this is not taken into account by the individual mass contributions .",
    "as the stellar mass of galaxies increase , qsf",
    "and di lose importance at expense of the effect of mergers .",
    "in particular , the role of minor mergers becomes relevant , as it is evident by the fractions presented in the middle panel of fig .",
    "1 , characterized by a steep increase since @xmath20 .",
    "this increment is less pronounced for less luminous galaxies ( grey lines ) , although the relative contribution of this process to the galaxy mass already acquired is larger than for brighter galaxies .",
    "besides , these fainter galaxies keep forming stars through qsf and di as indicated by the almost constant values depicted by grey lines since @xmath21 ( left panel ) , being consistent with the fact that the stellar mass keep growing as it consumes the available reservoir of cold gas . as shown by jimnez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , minor mergers involved in the evolution of the brightest galaxies are mainly dry mergers ( fraction of gas cold gas content in the central galaxy less than 0.6 ) .",
    "major dry mergers also affect their formation but are less important in terms of the contributed mass fraction . on the other hand",
    ", fainter galaxies also suffer sf associated to starbursts occurring during minor wet mergers .",
    "the total metallicity achieved at @xmath16 by the most luminous galaxies in the cmr , considering all physical processes , lies within the range @xmath22_{\\rm total } } \\leq 0.15 $ ] ( not shown here ) .",
    "taking into account that mergers ( mainly minor dry ones ) play a significant role in the evolution of these galaxies , we explore the evolution of the metallicity of the stars accreted and formed during these events .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of figure @xmath23 , where different line types depict the results obtained for galaxies in different magnitude bins . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the metallicity contributed by these components to the most luminous galaxies ranges within @xmath24_{\\rm mergers}}\\leq -0.15 $ ] . then , accreted stars in merger events contribute with metals having subsolar abundances . hence minor and major dry mergers suffered by the most luminous galaxies of the cmr since @xmath25 lead to the increase of their stellar mass without strongly affecting their metallicities .",
    "thus a break in the bright end of the cmr arises with galaxies rising their total luminosities but without changing their colours .",
    "the same results are found for @xmath26 and @xmath27 clusters , suggesting that the cmr is universal , in concordance with previous observational works ( e.g. lpez cruz et al .",
