    "multiwavelength constraints on the thermal emission of hot jupiters are crucial to precisely defining the spectral energy distributions of these planets and understanding their energy budgets .",
    "interestingly most hot jupiter thermal emission detections to date have not been at the blackbody peaks of these planets , but at longer wavelengths with the spitzer space telescope ( @xmath11 @xmath12 3 @xmath13 ; e.g. @xcite ) . probing shorter near - infrared wavelengths at the blackbody peaks of these planets",
    "has only recently been proven feasible first through space - based observations with the hubble space telescope ( hst ; @xcite ) , and then from the ground ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our program to detect near - infrared thermal emission from the hottest of the hot jupiters has also been successful using the wide - field infrared camera ( wircam ) on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) to detect the ks - band thermal emission of : tres-2b @xcite , tres-3b including an h - band upper - limit @xcite , and two eclipses of wasp-3b , including a limit on its temporal variability @xcite .    in the near - infrared multiple band detections",
    "have only been performed on a handful of occasions ; such multiple - band detections were performed in narrow wavelength regimes from space via spectroscopy with hst for hd 209458 and hd 189733 @xcite , and arguably recently from the ground for hd 189733 using the infrared telescope facility @xcite , as well as from the ground using the very large telescope in the h & k - bands for the highly irradiated hot jupiter wasp-19b @xcite .",
    "multiple band detections in the near - infrared are therefore rare compared to the frequent multiple - band detections at longer wavelengths using the irac @xcite , irs @xcite , or mips @xcite instruments on the spitzer space telescope .",
    "multiwavelength thermal emission measurements with spitzer have revealed a wealth of information , including that the most highly irradiated exoplanets seem to harbour hot stratospheres and temperature inversions @xcite .",
    "one could imagine that obtaining multiwavelength constraints on a planet s thermal emission in the near - infrared could be equally informative .",
    "furthermore the near - infrared is also an ideal place to directly constrain these planets pressure - temperature profiles at depth , dayside bolometric luminosities and the fraction of the incident stellar radiation that is transported from the tidally locked day to nightsides deep in these planets atmospheres @xcite .",
    "here we continue our program using wircam on cfht to detect thermal emission from some of the hottest of the hot jupiters .",
    "our target was the highly irradiated hot jupiter wasp-12b .",
    "the discovery of the inflated , transiting exoplanet wasp-12b was of immediate interest to those attempting to measure the loss in flux during the secondary eclipses of hot jupiters in the near - infrared - this was because wasp-12b circles a late f - type star with a period of only @xmath1426 hours @xcite .",
    "it is thus exposed to extremely high stellar insolation , with an incident flux of @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "the planet is also one of the most inflated hot jupiters , with a radius of @xmath21@xmath141.8@xmath22 and a favourable planet - to - star radius ratio ( @xmath23@xmath140.12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it should be heated to an equilibrium temperature of over @xmath142500 @xmath24 assuming isotropic reradiation and a zero bond albedo .",
    "for these reasons it was predicted to display near - infrared thermal emission on the order of 0.1 - 0.3% of the stellar flux in the j , h & ks near - infrared bands , assuming isotropic reradiation and a zero bond albedo .",
    "@xcite have already reported a detection of the secondary eclipse of wasp-12b in z-band ( 0.9 @xmath13 ) , and more recently @xcite have presented detections of two eclipses in the four irac channels for wasp-12b .",
    "@xcite , however , did not report the eclipse depths for wasp-12b , and for reasons discussed below the @xcite detection has recently been called into question .",
    "thus the atmospheric characteristics of wasp-12b remain largely unconstrained .",
    "in addition to receiving extremely high stellar insolation , wasp-12b is intriguing because the combination of its close proximity to its star and its putative original eccentricity ( @xmath6=0.049@xmath250.015 ; @xcite ) suggests that it could be precessing at a rate that is detectable with current instruments .",
    "such a putative precession signal was recently claimed by @xcite .",
    "although the irac eclipses reported by @xcite suggest an @xmath6cos@xmath7 constraint similar to that expected for a circular orbit ( @xmath6cos@xmath7@xmath26 - 0.0054@xmath250.0030 ) , @xcite had earlier reported an eclipse detection that was considerably offset from a circular orbit ( @xmath8@xmath6cos@xmath7@xmath8@xmath260.016@xmath27 ) .",
    "while at first glance the two measurements are inconsistent , if the planet precesses this is not the case . by combining their secondary eclipses with those of @xcite , together with",
    "the original radial velocity data for the system @xcite , as well as a series of transit - time measurements from the original detection paper and ground - based amateurs ( from the exoplanet transit database ; @xcite ) , @xcite show that a precessing orbital model best - fits the data with 2@xmath1 confidence .",
    "the authors caution that this detection is heavily dependent on the secondary eclipse offset reported by @xcite .",
    "even more recently , radial velocity observations of wasp-12b have suggested that the eccentricity of wasp-12b is small ( @xmath6=0.017@xmath28 ; @xcite ) and likely zero , constraining the @xcite precession signal and calling into question the @xcite eclipse detection .",
    "nevertheless , the best - fit eccentricity of wasp-12b remains non - zero , and thus this planet could be precessing at a much slower rate than @xcite claim . the definitive nail in the coffin on the claim that wasp-12b is precessing at a detectable rate , will thus only result from further detections of this planet s secondary eclipse well seperated in time from the original eclipse detections .",
    "also , recently preliminary evidence was presented that material from wasp-12b may be being tidally stripped from the planet and may possibly form a circumstellar disk in this system .",
    "@xcite predicted this system may have such a disk from material overfilling the roche lobe of wasp-12b , because wasp-12b s observed radius in the optical ( @xmath29@xmath141.79 @xmath22 ; @xcite ) is already close to its 2.36 @xmath22 roche lobe radius ( as quoted in @xcite ) . that wasp-12b may exhibit material overfilling it roche lobe and a circumstellar disk from this material",
    "has recently received possible confirmation from hst cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) observations of this system . from these observations",
    "@xcite find increased transit depths in the ultraviolet when compared to the optical , indicative of material surrounding wasp-12b overfilling its roche lobe and blocking out a larger fraction of the stellar flux at these wavelengths .",
    "in addition they observe an early ingress of the transit of wasp-12b in their near ultraviolet data ; @xcite intrepret this early ingress as a putative sign of previously stripped material from wasp-12b forming a circumstellar disk .",
    "these putative signs of a disk are interesting to observers in the near - infrared , specifically the k - band , as @xcite predicted that such a disk in this system may exhibit co emission as bright as 10 mjy at 2.292 @xmath13 .",
    "wasp-12 does not , however , display a significant near - infrared excess @xcite .    here",
    "we present detections of wasp-12b s thermal emission in the ks ( 24@xmath1 ) , h ( 9@xmath1 ) and j - bands ( 4@xmath1 ) .",
    "our j - band detection is the first thermal emission measurement in this band .",
    "our photometry favours a circular orbit for wasp-12b ( @xmath6@xmath9@xmath7@xmath26 - 0.0007@xmath30 ) . by combining our secondary eclipse times with those of @xcite and @xcite , as well as the radial velocity data of @xcite and @xcite , and all the transit - time data for the system , we are able to show that not only is there no evidence to date that wasp-12b is precessing at a detectable rate , but also that the orbit of wasp-12b is likely circular .",
    "our analysis also allows us to constrain the characteristics of the atmospere of wasp-12b ; our ks - band eclipse depth argues in favour of inefficient redistribution of heat from the day to nightside , while our j and h - band observations seem to be probing deeper , higher pressure atmospheric layers that are slightly more homogenized .",
    "we also show that our ks - band photometry may feature a longer than expected eclipse duration that could arguably be interpreted as evidence for material streaming from the planet or a circumstellar disk in this system .",
    "we obtained observations with wircam on cfht of wasp-12 ( @xmath31@xmath1410.48 , @xmath32@xmath1410.23 , @xmath24@xmath1410.19 ) on 2009 december 26 , 27 and 28 in the j , h & ks - bands respectively .",
    "our j - band observations on dec .",
    "26 lasted for 3.9 hours and started in mid - eclipse and persisted for 2.2 hours after the end of eclipse . our observations on dec .",
    "27 and 28 lasted for 6.0 hours in h - band and 6.2 hours in ks - band , respectively , evenly bracketing the predicted secondary eclipse of wasp-12b .",
    "numerous reference stars were also observed in the 21@xmath1621 arcmin field - of - view of wircam .",
    "the telescope was defocused for our various observations to approximately 1.5 mm ( j - band ) , 1.8 mm ( h - band ) , and 2.0 mm ( ks - band ) , resulting in the flux of our target star being spread over a ring @xmath1419 , @xmath1423 , and @xmath1426 pixels in diameter ( 6 , 7 and 8) on our array . for each observation , as the telescope temperature changed over the course of the night , we used the focus stage model and kept the defocus amount constant , thus achieved a stable psf over the entire observation set .",
    "we used `` staring mode '' for our j and ks - band observations where we do not dither for the duration of our observations ; for the h - band eclipse the queue observations mistakenly used micro - dithering which featured small 0.5 pixel shifts between consecutive exposures .",
    "the exposure times for our j , h & ks - band observations were 5-seconds .",
    "the effective duty cycle after accounting for readout and for saving exposures was 34% .    for both observations",
    "the data was reduced and aperture photometry was performed on our target star and our reference stars as discussed in @xcite ( with the details provided in @xcite ) .",
    "we used an aperture with a radius of 17 pixels for our ks - band photometry , and 16.5 pixels for our h and j - band photometry .",
    "we used an annulus to define the sky with an inner radius of 22 , and an outer radius of 34 pixels for all our photometry .",
    "we ensured that these choices of aperture were optimal by testing smaller and larger aperture sizes in increments of 0.5 pixels and ensuring these choices displayed the smallest root - mean - square ( rms ) outside of occultation and the least time - correlated red - noise .",
    "following our aperture photometry we correct the flux of our target star with a number of nearby reference stars as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we used 22 , 7 , and 17  reference stars to correct our j , h and ks - band eclipse photometry , respectively .",
    "the normalized flux of wasp-12 and the various reference stars that are used to correct the flux of our target star are displayed in figure [ figwasp12refstars ] .",
    "for our ks - band photometry we corrected our photometry for a small trend with the x , and y pixel position of the target star on the chip .",
    "we did nt notice such trends in our h and j - band photometry .    for our h - band photometry",
    "the airmass , @xmath33 , was high at the start of the observations ( x@xmath141.9 ) , and fell to @xmath33@xmath141.2 by mid - eclipse .",
    "we noticed a downward trend in our h - band photometry following the correction with nearby reference stars that appeared to be correlated with airmass .",
    "we found this effect was reduced , but not removed , for our h - band photometry by correcting the flux of wasp-12 with reference stars solely on the same wircam chip as wasp-12 ; this downward trend in flux of our target star compared to the reference stars is still apparent at the start of our h - band photometry . to reduce the impact of these systematic data we scale - up the errors of the first @xmath1425 minutes of data for our h - band photometry by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) of our photometry per minute following the above corrections improved from 10.0@xmath1610@xmath34  to 0.86@xmath1610@xmath34  in ks - band , 3.8@xmath1610@xmath34  to 0.90@xmath1610@xmath34  in h - band and 1.93@xmath1610@xmath34  to 0.69@xmath1610@xmath34  in j - band . to evaluate the impact of systematics and the presence of red - noise in our photometry we bin our data and compare the out - of - eclipse photometric precision to the gaussian noise expectation of one over the square - root of the bin - size ( figure [ figpoisson ] ) .",
    "the ks - band data bins down very close to the gaussian noise limit , while the j - band data bins down marginally above this limit ; the h - band data is worse , possibly due to the systematics introduced by the micro - dithering . to ensure we do not underestimate the uncertainties in our model parameters we employ the @xcite method to account for time - correlated red - noise in our photometry .",
    "we scale - up the uncertainties on our individual data - points by a factor @xmath35 ; @xmath35 is equal to the factor that the binned out - of - eclipse rms scales above the gaussian noise expectation in the absence of red - noise .",
    "we use a binning time of @xmath1412 minutes . for our h - band photometry",
    "we exclude the first 15 minutes of data from this calculation , due to the obvious systematic that we believe to be correlated with airmass that does not appear to affect the rest of the photometry . for our photometry @xmath35",
    "is equal to 1.7 , 1.3  and 1.1  for our j , h & ks - band data , respectively .",
    "we note that our observations are still well above the predicted photon noise rms limit of 2.7@xmath1610@xmath36 , 2.2@xmath1610@xmath36 and 3.1@xmath1610@xmath36 per minute in the j , h & ks - bands , respectively .",

    "this is due to the fact that although the @xmath6@xmath9@xmath153 values for wasp-12b are well - constrained from the radial - velocity data and the combination of the timing of the eclipses and transits ( the top - left panel of figure [ fighisto ] ) , the @xmath6@xmath176@xmath153 values are not well - constrained and thus higher eccentricity values are allowed ( the top - right panel of figure [ fighisto ] ) for an argument of periastron where @xmath9@xmath153@xmath140 at @xmath153@xmath1490@xmath154 and -90@xmath154 ( as can be seen in the contour plot in the bottom - right panel of figure [ fighisto ] ) .",

    "as our j - band data is a partial eclipse , it has no ability to constrain the eclipse duration on its own .",
    "similarly , as our h - band data suffers from significant systematics prior to and during ingress , its ability to constrain the eclipse duration is compromised ; in fact , the systematics at the beginning of the h - band photometry that manifest themselves as a sharp decrease in flux , can be well - fit by a significantly wider , and deeper secondary eclipse that is unlikely to be physical .",
    "these facts , combined with a visual inspection of figures [ figwasp12ks]-[figwasp12j ] , suggests that the wider secondary eclipse for our joint analysis , is in - fact dominated by our ks - band photometry and the longer duration eclipse may not be credible for the joint analysis .",
    "our ks - band photometry is best - fit with a wider secondary eclipse than expected : @xmath93=1.109@xmath94 .",
    "the first possibility to explain this wider than expected eclipse is systematic time - correlated , red - noise in our photometry , which would not be unexpected as the eclipse is only wider than expected at less than the 3@xmath1 level .",
    "another possibility for this wider eclipse is that the planet has a small eccentricity ( @xmath6@xmath176@xmath7=0.059@xmath117 ) .",
    "we have already presented strong evidence that the eccentricity of wasp-12b is quite likely near zero in @xmath181[sececcentricity ] and the @xcite spitzer / irac eclipse photometry does not feature a longer duration secondary eclipse .",
    "also , although the @xmath6sin@xmath7 of the planet is less well constrained in @xmath181[sececcentricity ] , an @xmath6sin@xmath7 value necessary to explain our longer duration eclipse can be ruled out at several sigma and thus we find this possibility uncompelling .",
    "another possibility  perhaps the most intriguing possibility  is that if this apparently wider secondary eclipse is not due to systematic effects or due to a small @xmath6@xmath176@xmath7 for wasp-12b , then it could be due to radiation from gas that is escaping from the planet and possibly forming a cicumstellar disk .",
    "the latter was predicted by @xcite , while the former was arguably recently confirmed by @xcite through observations that wasp-12b displayed increased transit depths in the uv with cos / hst .",
    "an eclipse of this duration could argue for material surrounding the planet with a projected radius that is approximately 1.9  times the optical radius of the planet , or at a radius of 3.3  @xmath182 , and would thus argue for material emitting radiation that is exceeding the roche lobe , and streaming from the planet",
    ". this emission could be due to co @xmath142.292 bandhead emission , as predicted by @xcite , although the material around the planet should be cooler than the @xmath144000 - 5000 k temperatures they predicted for the cirumstellar disk and will thus result in reduced emission . in the `` accretion stream '' hypothesis , advocated by @xcite",
    ", the material streaming from the planet towards the star may be highly localized in a line passing through the inner lagrangian point . the extra emission from this stream",
    "would be obscured by the star earlier than the planet during eclipse ingress and later than the planet during eclipse egress .",
    "such a scenario is arguably favoured over simply a sphere of evaporating material 3.3  @xmath182 in radius , as in the accretion stream scenario the emission will arise from a smaller surface area ; otherwise the ks - band brightness temperature of the planet would have to be anomalously low , given that the @xmath42=0.309@xmath0% that we observe would have to be a combination of the planet and the enveloping material that would have a much larger surface area of emitting material than the planet itself .",
    "alternatively , this wider eclipse could be interpreted as the planet passing behind a circumstellar disk that is optically thick at these wavelengths and extends marginally from the star ( at least @xmath141.11 times the stellar radius ) , and therefore obscures the planet earlier and later than expected .",
    "if the disk is optically thick it will have to be due to gas opacity , as the temperature of the disk will be well above the dust sublimation temperature , and the temperature and density of the disk will have to be high enough for the material to be largely photoionized to avoid the `` opacity gap '' @xcite .",
    "the disk would also have to be optically thick at around 2 @xmath13 , but not at the longer wavelengths probed by spitzer / irac ( 3.6 to 8.0 @xmath13 ) as the durations of the eclipses are not discrepant from the expected duration in the @xcite photometry .",
    "the `` accretion stream '' hypothesis is arguably less contrived , but the observed eclipse duration could also result from a combination of both scenarios .    an obvious way to differentiate between these two scenarios would be observations of wasp-12 during transit in the ks - band band . if wasp-12 is surrounded by a circumstellar disk that is emitting in ks - band then the transit duration will increase .",
    "if there is material surrounding wasp-12b then its transit will be of the expected duration if the material is optically thin , and the transit will display an increased depth if the material is optically thick .",
    "we plan to perform such follow - up observations of the transit and eclipse of wasp-12b in the ks and h - bands to differentiate between these various scenarios , and to confirm the near - zero eccentricity of wasp-12b . until such follow - up observations take place we emphasize that our ks - band photometry is best - fit with a wider eclipse at less than the 3@xmath1 level .",
    "our measurements of the thermal emission of wasp-12b allow us to constrain the characteristics of its atmosphere , including : its bond albedo , the level of redistribution of heat from the day to the nightside at various depths , and the planet s dayside bolometric luminosity .",
    "we parameterize the level of redistribution by the reradiation factor , @xmath183 , following the @xcite definition ( i.e. @xmath183=@xmath184 denotes isotropic reradiation , while @xmath183=@xmath185 denotes redistribution and reradiation from the dayside only ) .",

    "wasp-12b is an ideal target for such observations with its short 1.09@xmath207 period , and its bright dayside emission suggests that thermal phase curve observations for this planet should reveal a large asymmetry over the course of the orbit as wasp-12b s nightside should be cold .",
    "thermal phase curve observations from the ground in the near - infrared would require one to control the background systematic trends that are present in our near - infrared photometry even after we correct the flux of our target star with a great many reference stars ; the feasibility of this task is , as of yet , unproven .",
    "nevertheless , we will be investigating the possibility of obtaining such near - infrared phase curve information in this photometry as well as with future observations of wasp-12b .",
