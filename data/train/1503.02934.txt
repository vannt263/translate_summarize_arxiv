    "the molecular line integrated intensity extends in the e  w direction in a manner similar to the distribution of dust continuum emission except hco@xmath11 10 , which may trace both infall and outflow ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the integrated intensity peaks of these molecular lines are offset from the continuum peak position of l1251a , and relatively optically thin lines such as h@xmath0co@xmath11 10  and n@xmath12h@xmath11 10  show bigger offsets .",
    "the integrated intensity peak of h@xmath0co@xmath11 10  is @xmath330 @xmath26 to the south of l1251a ( figure 4b ) and is coincident with the position of irs 14 .",

    "the integrated intensity peaks of relatively optically thick molecular emission such as hco@xmath11 10  and hcn 10  slightly shifted to southwest .",
    "the disagreements of positions between the intensity peaks of single dish dust continuum emission and the molecular line integrated intensity peaks might indicate that the distribution of molecular gas around l1251a is complicated because of 4 sources existing within about 25 @xmath26 ( i.e. , 0.04 pc ) .",
    "for example , heating by these sources can evaporate co from the dust grain surfaces , which is a mother molecule of hco@xmath41 but a destroyer of n@xmath42h@xmath41 .",

    "the spectrum of hco@xmath11 10  toward l1251a shows a strong self - absorption dip with a classic blue asymmetric line profile , which has been believed as an infall indicator @xcite .",

    "the fwhms of n@xmath12h@xmath11 10  and hcn 10  are 0.6 and 1.04 km s@xmath22 , respectively .",

    "in addition , the profile of @xmath43 21 hyperfine component of hcn 10  line , which also has been believed as an infall tracer , is similar to that of hco@xmath11 10 .",
    "the line profile of hco@xmath11 10  is superimposed by two ( broad and narrow ) components and the narrow component shows the self - absorption feature . the broad component ( @xmath44 4.8 km s@xmath22 , @xmath45 km s@xmath22 )",
    "is seen in all positions across the observed map while the narrow component ( @xmath44 5.3 km s@xmath22 , @xmath46 km s@xmath22 ) is detected just around l1251a .",
    "the integrated intensity map of the broad component ( not shown ) shows a similar distribution to the hco@xmath11 10  outflow ( see section 4.4 below ) , suggesting the origin of the broad component may be the outflows from l1251a .",
    "the integrated intensity map of the hco@xmath11 10  narrow component and that of the isolated component of n@xmath12h@xmath11 10  show similar distributions , although the integrated intensity peaks of the two lines are not coincident ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the similarity suggests that the narrow component of hco@xmath11 10  may trace the dense and relatively quiescent molecular gas around l1251a like the other molecular lines ( except for co 10 ) .",

    "<S> we present a multi - wavelength observational study of a low - mass star - forming region , l1251-c , with observational results at wavelengths from the near - infrared to the millimeter . _ </S>",
    "<S> spitzer space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> observations confirmed that iras 22343 + 7501 is a small group of protostellar objects . the extended emission to east  west direction with its intensity peak at the center of l1251a has been detected at 350 and 850  with the cso and jcmt telescopes , tracing dense envelope materials around l1251a . </S>",
    "<S> the single - dish data from the kvn and trao telescopes show inconsistencies between the intensity peaks of several molecular line emission and that of the continuum emission , suggesting complex distributions of molecular abundances around l1251a . </S>",
    "<S> the sma interferometer data , however , show intensity peaks of co 21  and @xmath0co 21  located at the position of irs 1 , which is both the brightest source in irac image and the weakest source in the 1.3 mm dust continuum map . </S>",
    "<S> irs 1 is the strongest candidate for the driving source of the newly detected compact co 21  outflow . over the whole region ( 14@xmath114@xmath2 ) of l125l - c , 3 class i and 16 class ii sources have been detected , including three ysos in l1251a . a comparison with the average projected distance among 19 ysos in l1251-c and that among 3 ysos in l1251a suggests l1251-c is an example of low - mass cluster formation , where protostellar objects are forming in a small group . </S>"
