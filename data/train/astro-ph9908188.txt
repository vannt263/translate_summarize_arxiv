    "the starbursts in nearby ultraluminous galaxies ( @xcite ) take place primarily in the nuclear regions . using isocam",
    "we have made observations of the mid - infrared emission at 5 - 16 @xmath0 m in a sample of 10 very luminous galaxies . at a distance of 42 mpc , arp 299 ( mrk 171 ; ngc 3690/ic 694 )",
    "is the closest system of this class with a bolometric luminosity of 8@xmath110@xmath2l@xmath3 .",
    "the nuclei are still @xmath45 kpc apart , and it represents a merger in an earlier stage of evolution compared with ngc 6240 and arp 220 , where the nuclei are @xmath51 kpc apart .",
    "the upper panel of figure 1 ( from hibbard & yun , private communication ) exhibits optical and hi tidal tails 160 kpc in length emerging from the colliding disks .",
    "it is striking that the hi tail is spatially displaced from the optical tail .",
    "the lower panel shows the 7 @xmath0 m emission from @xcite .",
    "the 7 and 15 @xmath0 m images reveal that about 90% of the emission from the whole system comes from the two unresolved dust - enshrouded sources a and b1 which have sizes of less than 300 pc in radius and are inconspicuous in the optical .",
    "these two regions are strong hcn sources with some indication of rotation in source b1 @xcite .",
    "although the studies of arp 299 at other wavelengths support the hypothesis that a and b1 are nuclear starbursts , the cvf mid - infrared spectrum of b1 exhibits -besides the signatures of starbursts- a 3 - 10 @xmath0 m continuum frequently observed in agns @xcite .    source a dominates in the far infrared whereas source b in the mid - infrared @xcite , and it can be concluded that more than 90% of the bolometric luminosity in arp 299 comes from the two nuclei with sizes @xmath5300pc in radius .",
    "similar results were obtained for ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. the superantennae , @xcite ) , where more than 98% of the mid - infrared emission at 15@xmath0 m comes from a nuclear region hosting a seyfert 2 nucleus .",
    "one of the new findings with iso is a very luminous dust - enshrouded extranuclear starburst in the antennae ( ngc 4038/39 ) . in this early merger of two sc galaxies we found an extranuclear starburst with size @xmath5 50 pc in radius producing @xmath415% of the overall 15 @xmath0 m mid - infrared output .",
    "furthermore , the analyses of the mid - infrared spectra indicate that the most massive stars in this system are formed inside this optically invisible knot .    in figure 2",
    "is shown in contours the mid - infrared ( 12 - 18 @xmath0 m ) image of the antennae galaxies obtained with iso ( @xcite ) , superimposed on the optical image from hst .",
    "below are shown representative spectra of the two nuclei and the brightest mid - infrared knot .",
    "the multiwavelength view of this prototype merging system suggests caution in deriving scenarios of early evolution of galaxies at high redshift using only observations in the narrow rest - frame ultraviolet wavelength range ( mirabel et al .",
    "although the actual numbers of this type of systems is not large in the local universe , we must keep in mind that there are indications of strong number density evolution as a function of redshift in luminous infrared galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , that the most intense starbursts are enshrouded in dust , and that no ultraviolet light leaks out from these regions .",
    "+ another example of an extra - nuclear starburst is also observed in the prototypical collisional ring galaxy `` the cartwheel '' ( @xcite ) . in figure 3",
    "is shown in contours the mid - infrared image in broad band filters lw2(5 - 8.5@xmath0 m ) and lw3(12 - 18@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the mid - ir maps cover the cartwheel galaxy and the two nearby companions g1 and g2 .",
    "the intensity of the mid - ir emission from the outer star forming ring of the cartwheel shows considerable azimuthal variation and peaks at the most active h@xmath6 regions of the ring .",
    "interestingly , in the lw3(12 - 18@xmath0 m ) filter , only the hot - spot is detected in the outer ring .",
    "in addition , the lw3/lw2 flux ratio , often used as a diagnostic of the intensity of the radiation field has a value of 5.2 which is comparable to the brightest extranuclear starburst in the antennae galaxies .",
    "giant radio galaxies are thought to be massive ellipticals powered by accretion of interstellar matter onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "interactions with gas rich galaxies may provide the interstellar matter to feed the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . to power radio lobes that extend up to distances of hundreds of kiloparsecs , gas has to be funneled from kiloparsec size scales down to the agn at rates of @xmath41 m@xmath3 yr@xmath7 during @xmath410@xmath8 years . therefore , large and massive quasi - stable structures of gas and dust should exist in the deep interior of the giant elliptical hosts of double lobe radio galaxies .",
    "recent mid - infrared observations with iso revealed for the first time a bisymmetric spiral structure with the dimensions of a small galaxy at the centre of centaurus a ( mirabel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the spiral was presumably formed out of the tidal debris of an accreted gas - rich object(s ) and has a dust morphology that is remarkably similar to that found in barred spiral galaxies ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the observations of this closest agn to earth suggest that the dusty hosts of giant radio galaxies like cena , are  symbiotic \" galaxies composed of a barred spiral inside an elliptical , where the bar serves to funnel gas toward the agn .",
    "the barred spiral at the centre of cena has dimensions comparable to that of the small local group galaxy messier 33 .",
    "it lies on a plane that is almost parallel to the minor axis of the giant elliptical .",
    "whereas the spiral rotates with maximum radial velocities of @xmath4250 km s@xmath7 , the ellipsoidal stellar component seems to rotate slowly ( maximum line - of - sight velocity is @xmath440 km s@xmath7 ) approximately perpendicular to the dust lane .",
    "the genesis , morphology , and dynamics of the spiral formed at the centre of cena are determined by the gravitational potential of the elliptical , much as a usual spiral with its dark matter halo . on the other hand ,",
    "the agn that powers the radio jets is fed by gas funneled to the center via the bar structure of the spiral .",
    "the spatial co - existence and intimate association between these two distinct and dissimilar systems suggest that cen a is the result from a cosmic symbiosis ."
