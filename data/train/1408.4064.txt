    "perturbative calculations play an important role in field theoretical approach to understanding particle interactions .",
    "several techniques have been developed to tackle the ever increasing complexities for the task of evaluating multiloop feynman diagrams , mostly in the context of dimensional regularization @xcite or analytic regularization @xcite  and among them we can mention the powerful mellin - barnes contour integration @xcite , the method of gegenbauer polynomials @xcite , the differential equations technique @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the ndim developed by halliday and ricotta @xcite has shown itself as a reliable one when applied to the calculation of diagrams of one- @xcite , two- @xcite and multi - loops @xcite , with scalar and tensorial structures and in noncovariant gauges @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of ndim is that it allows us to avoid the often cumbersome parametric integrals , transfering the problem into easier solving systems of linear equations instead .",
    "another advantage of ndim is that the exponents of propagators are taken to be arbitrary integers , so that one can solve the general case for each type of graph",
    ". a severe drawback of this method is that as the number of loops increases , the number of systems of linear equations that must be solved grows to staggering heights .",
    "one would like then to work out higher loops via loop - by - loop calculation with inserted simpler results .",
    "the analytic result for the one - loop massless triangle feynman diagram has been evaluated long ago by boos and davydychev @xcite and since then reproduced in many different contexts , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is written in terms of a linear combination of four appel @xcite hypergeometric functions of two variables @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 label the three external momenta that flow along the triangle s three external legs .",
    "this well - known result for the off - shell triangle , however , _ is not valid _ for every momentum ; those momenta must be such that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , the series is defined inside some region of convergence and for this reason the well - known result of boos and davydychev @xcite can not be used in a loop by loop calculation @xcite . because a loop integration implies that the integrated momentum runs from minus infinity to plus infinity",
    ", we can easily see why the linear combination of four @xmath10 s with same variables will run into trouble within a loop by loop calculation . to solve this difficulty one needs to use the correct analytic expression for the triangle diagram which allows further integration on the momentum variables appearing within the appel s functions .",
    "fortunately , such suitable and shortened version for the triangle diagram result can be constructed , which is written in terms of only three appel s hypergeometric functions @xmath11 .",
    "this shortened and simplified form that is adequate for further momentum integration is obtained using the analytic continuation properties obeyed by the appel s functions that preserve momentum conservation in the three legs of the triangle diagram @xcite .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : first we translate the @xmath12-dimensional feynman integral for the master diagram of figure [ figure 1 : ] in the language of ndim , then we calculate it using the negative dimensions technique .",
    "once the ndim result is obtained , we perform an appropriate analytic continuation to positive @xmath12-dimensionality to get our desired result .",
    "let us consider the two - loop `` master '' diagram as shown in figure [ figure 1 : ] .",
    "the feynman integral associated to such a diagram is @xmath13 where @xmath5 is the external momentum .    in the ndim we could , at least in principle ,",
    "tackle this double integral in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) at once .",
    "however , as it has been already mentioned , this leads to the computation of more than eight thousand systems of coupled linear equations whose solutions are expressed as multiple series of hypergeometric - type with unknown analytic properties , so that we have no idea as to how to construct distinct complete sets of linearly independent solutions from among all those eight thousand plus results .",
    "thus , the alternative is to evaluate it stepwise , order by order , performing one momentum integral at a time . to do this",
    ", we immediately note that there makes no difference at all whether we integrate first in @xmath14 or in @xmath4 since in both cases we have to integrate a one - loop triangle type integral first .",
    "we could write the above integral as , for example , @xmath15 and we readily recognize the integral in momentum @xmath4 as an off - shell triangle one , which has a well - known result @xcite that can be written in terms of a linear combination of four appel hypergeometric functions of two variables @xmath16 with the two momentum dependent variables given , for example , as @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "using now the series representation for the appel functions of these specific two variables , we can therefore see that the remaining @xmath14-integral is of a self - energy type with shifted exponents for the propagators , @xmath19^{1+\\nu } } , \\label{2nd_integral}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a factor which depends on @xmath21 , the dimension @xmath12 as well as the exponents of propagators .",
    "the shifting exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 also depend on the dimension @xmath12 and exponents of propagators in the former integration , as well as on the double sum indices , say @xmath24 , of the @xmath11 series . however , straightforward application of this does not yield the correct result .",
    "here comes an important point : to carry out the second integral eq .",
    "( [ 2nd_integral ] ) one has to perform the integral over the whole space , for this reason the result of the former one must hold on the whole range of momentum @xmath14 . the well - known result of the off - shell triangle , written as a sum of four appel s hypergeometric functions @xmath25 , _ is not valid _ for all momentum range ; these momenta must be such that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , the series is defined inside some region of convergence and for this reason the well - known result of boos and davydychev @xcite can not be used in ( [ 1st_integral ] ) for the @xmath4 integration .    as demonstrated in @xcite , the result for the triangle diagram that should be plugged into eq .",
    "( [ 1st_integral ] ) has only three @xmath10 s .",
    "this choice guarantees that the @xmath14 integration may be performed for the whole interval @xmath26 .",
    "the ndim is characterized among other things , by two features : one is the generalized exponents for the propagators , say @xmath27 , and the other is the polynomial nature of the integrands that represent the propagators .",
    "thus , in the spirit of the ndim technique for performing feynman integrals @xcite , we introduce the ndim counterpart of ( [ 1st_integral ] ) , namely , @xmath28^{h}\\,\\int",
    "d^{d}k \\:(k^2)^{i}\\,[(k - p)^2]^{j}\\,[(k - q)^2]^{l}.\\label{1st_integralndim}\\ ] ]    let us first concentrate our attention in the triangle part : @xmath29^j\\,[(k - q)^2]^l}.\\ ] ]    since there is a recurrent appearance of a certain expression involving the exponents of propagators and dimension @xmath12 , we introduce for convenience , the following definition , @xmath30 , and also define @xmath31 .    the standard solution for eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) is a sum of four terms @xcite : @xmath32 where the four coefficients @xmath33 are written in terms of pochhammer s symbols @xmath34 of the several exponents of propagators and dimension @xmath12 : @xmath35 and the various parameters of the hypergeometric functions are listed in the table below :    .parameters of appel s functions in eq .",
    "( [ triangle4 ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in principle any one of these three sets ( unprimed , primed or double primed ) could be inserted into the remaining @xmath14-integral and the integration carried out .",
    "however , in order to compare our ensuing result for the two - loop `` master '' self - energy diagram with already known result , it so happens that the most convenient sets are the primed and/or the double primed ones .",
    "the reason why the unprimed set is not convenient is due to the fact that @xmath36 is proportional to both @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which when inserted into the @xmath14-loop integration will lead to more complicate structure for the parameters in the function part of the answer . in our present case ,",
    "this function part is expressed as a series of the form : @xmath39 where parameters @xmath40 depend on the exponents of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "when any one of the @xmath41 is zero , only the @xmath42 term in the sum survives and in this case @xmath43 may coalesce into simpler forms @xmath44 and thus be summed up using gauss summation formula for hypergeometric series after integration .",
    "this kind of sum simplification and coalescence of @xmath45 fails to occur in the case of @xmath36 .",
    "thus in the following we take the primed set of solutions for the triangle diagram to perform the calculations .",
    "the @xmath14-momentum integral is of a one - loop self - energy type integral , so just for reference we quote here the general result valid for such an integral in ndim : @xmath46^f \\nonumber \\\\                  & = & ( -\\pi)^{d/2}(p^2)^{\\sigma_1 } \\frac{(1+\\sigma_1)_{-2\\sigma_1-d/2}}{(1+e)_{-\\sigma_1}(1+f)_{-\\sigma_1}}\\ , , \\qquad \\sigma_1 \\equiv e + f + d/2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    application of this ndim formula will produce again recurring expressions which we define conveniently using short hand notations , such that , for example , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "thus , proper evaluation ( details are left to appendix ) of those relevant three terms gives respectively : @xmath49    we can now collect all the individual results and write our answer to eq .",
    "( [ 1st_integralndim ] ) as the linear combination @xmath50 where the three coefficients @xmath51 and three functions @xmath52 are respectively given by : @xmath53 and @xmath54    having obtained these results we now have to analytic continue to positive dimension and negative values of exponents @xmath55 .",
    "this is accomplished by operating on the pochhammer s symbols present in the coefficients @xmath51 , which is typical of the ndim technique.then analyticly continuing eq .",
    "( [ 1st_integralndim ] ) we get from eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) : @xmath56    the final result for the two - loop `` master '' self - energy diagram with generalized exponents of propagators is therefore given by eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) . in it",
    "the analytic continuation of the exponents to negative values , @xmath57 , in the pochhammer s symbols are done using the well - known relation @xcite : @xmath58    using this analytic continuation relation for the various pochhammer s factors in the coefficients given in eqs .",
    "( [ c1])-([c3 ] ) we get @xmath59    in order for us to check whether this result is consistent with known results previously obtained via other methods , it is necessary to particularize the result in eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) for the specific values @xmath60 , which is tantamount to evaluate the original feynman integral for the two - loop master integral given in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) .",
    "moreover , as pointed out previously , since we are taking the special case @xmath61 , this implies that all sum terms where we meet @xmath62 vanishes except for @xmath42 .",
    "also @xmath63 as the numerator parameter in @xmath45 reduces the function to just a constant equal to 1.the other functions @xmath45 in eqs .",

    "the second term within the square brackets may be written as @xmath70 while the first and third terms within square brackets may be written together as @xmath71    thus finally @xmath72.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is exactly the result obtained via gegenbauer polynomials method by chetyrkin s _ et al _ ( cf .",
    "( 2.14 ) , p. 351",
    "in the first reference in @xcite ) .",
    "after obtaining the two - loop `` master '' self - energy diagram result , it is not difficult to get the three loop two - point funtion for the diagram depicted in figure [ figure2 : ] .",
    "we explicitly draw in it the momentum flow in each line and use the convention @xmath73 , @xmath74 for convenience .",
    "then the corresponding integral reads : @xmath75    in the spirit of order - by - order integration , this can be written as @xmath76^f,\\ ] ] where in the first @xmath77-integration we have explicited @xmath78 .",
    "this integral is a one - loop self - energy integral given in eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) with @xmath79 in place of @xmath5 and @xmath80 . plugging this result into eq .",

    "( [ 3loops_sigma1 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ 1st_integralndim ] ) we note that the former has exactly the same structure of integrand as the latter one ; the only difference being the exponent that appears in the @xmath82 factor  instead of @xmath83 in the former , we have now @xmath84 in the latter expression",
    ". then we can immediately write @xmath85    upon analytic continuation to positive dimension and negative values of exponents , we get @xmath86    it is now a simple matter of substituting the correct values of exponents for the case @xmath87 and careffully manipulating the various gamma functions that appear to obtain the final result for the three loop integral @xmath88    the final result for eq .",
    "( [ 3loops_result ] ) is then @xmath89    this is concordant with the result given in hathrell @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( 8.13 ) on page 176 ) .",
    "in this work we have demonstrated that in a loop by loop calculation of higher order feynman diagrams , the standard analytic solution for the one - loop triangle diagram expressed in terms of a linear combination of four appel s hypergeometric functions of two variables can not be used .",
    "the reason why such a solution for the triangle can not be used can be understood considering that those variables defining the hypergeometric functions are restricted to convergence constraints , and loop integrations require momentum running from minus infinity to plus infinity . also , our result hints that such an analytic expression for the triangle diagram also is not correct for further integration due to the fact that those variables are connected by a momentum conservation constraint , namely , @xmath90 , and therefore , not all the four appel s hypergeometric functions are linearly independent to each other .",
    "therefore , on the grounds of mathematical argumentation concerning constraints to lower the number of independent functions as well as the physical argumentation connected to the domain of momentum integration and variables convergence region , the analytic function for the triangle diagram that allows for further momentum integration must be a linear combination of three independent appel s function . which three of these functions should be can only be determined invoking another physical input beyond momentum conservation @xcite .    using the modified triangle diagram integral expressed as a linear combination of _ three _ linearly independent solutions in terms of _ three _",
    "appel s functions of two variables , two of which have the same variables @xmath91 and @xmath92 and the third one having variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xcite we were able to calculate the two - loop `` master '' self - energy diagram using ndim performing order - by - order calculation .",
    "of course , our calculation shows that the same care must be taken for order - by - order calculation done in the usual positive dimensional calculations involving embedded triangle diagrams .",
    "once the result for the two - loop `` master '' diagram is obtained , it is a matter of straighforward calculation to obtain the corresponding three - loop diagram as in figure [ figure 2 : ] since the feynman integral associated to such diagram can be reduced to the two - loop case once a convenient one - loop self - energy diagram integral is performed .",
    "the only novelty is that this ensuing two - loop `` master '' integral now bears a shifted exponent in one of the integrand factors .",
    "the remaining of the calculation is just manipulation of gamma function factors using the property @xmath95 and its related versions together with use of well - known properties of hypergeometric functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 of unity argument .",
