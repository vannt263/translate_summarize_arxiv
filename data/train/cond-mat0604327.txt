    "first , concerning the singular frequency dependence for @xmath71 , there should be no difference between measurements at the copper- , o(1)- or o(2)-site .",
    "furthermore , a singular frequency dependence should only show up when the temperature becomes comparable to @xmath168 k. a diffusion - like contribution for @xmath5 as has been suggested by thurber _",
    "et al._@xcite based on @xmath18o nmr measurements at the o(1)-site can not be explained in a pure heisenberg model and with the hyperfine interaction being the only relevant relaxation process .",
    "however , the evidence presented in favor of such a contribution is rather weak .",
    "there is no reason to assume that the spin - lattice relaxation rate in the limit of infinite magnetic field @xmath21 is given by the field theory result where the effect of the magnetic field on the spin - spin correlations has been ignored .",
    "in fact , the magnetic field can only be ignored if @xmath169 compared to @xmath170 expected from field theory . as contributions from @xmath17 are strongly suppressed , this next - leading temperature dependent term most likely has to do with corrections to the simple @xmath64-peak ( [ deltafunc ] ) obtained from the luttinger model for the dynamical structure factor at small @xmath10",
    ". from recent studies at zero temperature we know that a finite band curvature will broaden the @xmath64-peak and lead to interesting singularities at the lower and upper thresholds as well as to a high - frequency tail.@xcite at finite temperatures , spectral weight will also appear below the lower threshold .",
    "further research , if these corrections can indeed explain the measured temperature - dependence of @xmath171 is necessary .",
    "finally , i want to remark that in the free fermion case the next - leading term at low temperatures is of order @xmath172 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ f4],[f5 ] ) ) and not @xmath173 .",
    "that suggests that if a @xmath173-contribution exists , it should either have an amplitude which vanishes for @xmath26 or otherwise the exponent has to change as a function of @xmath22 .",
