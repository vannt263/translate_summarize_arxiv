    "a frequently used method for edge - preserving image denoising is the variational approach which minimizes the rudin - osher - fatemi ( rof ) functional  @xcite . in a discrete ( penalized )",
    "form the rof functional can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the given corrupted image and @xmath4 denotes the discrete gradient operator which contains usually first order forward differences in vertical and horizontal directions .",
    "the regularizing term @xmath5 can be considered as discrete version of the total variation ( tv ) functional .",
    "since the gradient does not penalize constant areas the minimizer of the rof functional tends to have such regions , an effect known as staircasing .",
    "an approach to avoid this effect consists in the employment of higher order differences / derivatives .",
    "since the pioneering work  @xcite which couples the tv term with higher order terms by infimal convolution various techniques with higher order differences / derivatives were proposed in the literature , among them  @xcite .    in various applications in image processing and computer vision the functions of interest",
    "take values on the circle @xmath0 or another manifold .",
    "processing manifold - valued data has gained a lot of interest in recent years .",
    "examples are wavelet - type multiscale transforms for manifold data   @xcite and manifold - valued partial differential equations   @xcite .",
    "finally we like to mention statistical issues on riemannian manifolds  @xcite and in particular the statistics of circular data  @xcite .",
    "the tv notation for functions with values on a manifold has been studied in  @xcite using the theory of cartesian currents .",
    "these papers were an extension of the previous work  @xcite were the authors focus on @xmath0-valued functions and show in particular the existence of minimizers of certain energies in the space of functions with bounded total cyclic variation .",
    "the first work which applies a cyclic tv approach among other models for imaging tasks was recently published by cremers and strekalovskiy in  @xcite .",
    "the authors unwrapped the function values to the real axis and proposed an algorithmic solution to account for the periodicity .",
    "an algorithm which solves tv regularized minimization problems on riemannian manifolds was proposed by lellmann et al . in",
    "they reformulate the problem as a multilabel optimization problem with an infinite number of labels and approximate the resulting hard optimization problem using convex relaxation techniques .",
    "the algorithm was applied for chromaticity - brightness denoising , denoising of rotation data and processing of normal fields for visualization .",
    "another approach to tv minimization for manifold - valued data via cyclic and parallel proximal point algorithms was proposed by one of the authors and his colleagues in  @xcite .",
    "it does not require any labeling or relaxation techniques .",
    "the authors apply their algorithm in particular for diffusion tensor imaging and interferometric sar imaging . for cartan - hadamard manifolds convergence of the algorithm",
    "was shown based on a recent result of bak  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , one of the simplest manifolds that is not of cartan - hadamard type is the circle  @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we deal with the incorporation of higher order differences into the energy functionals to improve denoising results for @xmath0-valued data .",
    "note that the ( second - order ) total generalized variation was generalized for tensor fields in  @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper which defines second order differences of cyclic data and uses them in regularization terms of energy functionals for image restoration .",
    "we focus on a discrete setting .",
    "first we provide a meaningful definition of higher order differences for cyclic data which we call _ absolute cyclic differences_. in particular our absolute cyclic first order differences resemble the geodesic distance ( arc length distance ) on the circle .",
    "as the geodesics the absolute cyclic second order differences take only values in @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "this is not necessary the case for differences of order larger than two .",
    "following the idea in  @xcite we suggest a cyclic proximal point algorithm to minimize the resulting functionals .",
    "this algorithm requires the evaluation of certain proximal mappings .",
    "we provide analytical expression for these mappings .",
    "further , we suggest an appropriate choice of the cycles such that the whole algorithm becomes very efficient .",
    "we apply our algorithm to artificial data as well as to real - world interferometric sar data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : diff ] we propose a definition of differences on @xmath0 .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : prox ] , we provide analytical expressions for the proximal mappings required in our cyclic proximal point algorithm .",
    "the approach is based on unwrapping the circle to  @xmath6 and considering the corresponding proximal mappings on the euclidean space .",
    "the cyclic proximal point algorithm is presented in section  [ sec : cpp ] . in particular",
    "we describe a vectorization strategy which makes the matlab implementation efficient and provides parallelizability , and prove its convergence under certain assumptions .",
