    "fermion production in the presence of large boson occupation numbers is an important question for various aspects of early - universe cosmology as well as collision experiments of heavy nuclei in the laboratory .",
    "large boson occupation numbers can lead to substantial deviations from perturbative production processes .",
    "an important application concerns the question of thermalization following nonequilibrium instabilities in the context of early - universe inflaton reheating dynamics  @xcite , or in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) relevant for relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium instabilities lead to exponential growth of boson occupation numbers in long wavelength modes on time scales much shorter than the asymptotic thermal equilibration time .",
    "this is followed by a period during which bosons develop power cascades in a manner reminiscent of kolmogorov wave turbulence  @xcite . for long wavelengths a new class of nonperturbative scaling solutions",
    "has recently been found in the context of early - universe reheating dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding nonthermal infrared fixed points  @xcite have the dramatic consequence that a diverging time scale exists far from equilibrium , which can prevent or substantially delay thermalization .",
    "understanding these phenomena in the presence of fermions is an important step towards more realistic phenomenological applications .    in this work we study nonequilibrium fermion production in yukawa - type models following a spinodal / tachyonic instability .",
    "more precisely , we consider a @xmath1 symmetric theory for massless dirac fermions coupled to a @xmath2 vector of scalars in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "the model incorporates the chiral symmetry of massless two - flavor qcd .",
    "it can also be considered as a model for scalar inflaton dynamics coupled to fermions . for our purposes ,",
    "a major aspect of this model is that controlled approximation schemes are available , which can describe the far - from - equilibrium dynamics at early times as well as the late - time approach to thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is based on a @xmath0 expansion to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action out of equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the fermion - boson loop - contributions included in this approximation allow us for the first time to describe the phenomenon of instability - induced fermion production : this production mechanism is based on the exponential growth of long - wavelength boson occupation numbers following a nonequilibrium instability .",
    "it is very efficient in the sense that the amplification of fermion occupation numbers proceeds with the maximum primary growth rate of boson occupancies .",
    "this can lead to a fast approach to thermal equilibrium fermion distributions for low momentum modes , though the bosons are still far from equilibrium at this stage . at higher momenta , where boson occupation numbers are low , the fermion occupancies exhibit a power - law regime with exponent two . apart from a numerical solution without further assumptions , we present approximate analytical solutions which provide a detailed understanding of the underlying dynamics .",

    "this has not been done before including fermion fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , the bosonic part of our model has been studied in great detail and the 2pi @xmath0 expansion to nlo is known to provide a quantitative description of nonperturbatively large boson fluctuations for the considered case with @xmath2  @xcite . here",
    "we evaluate the 2pi effective action for vanishing macroscopic field .",
    "the observed phenomena in the fermionic sector are , therefore , entirely due to quantum corrections that are neglected in previous studies where the dirac equation is solved in the presence of a classical macroscopic field .",
    "in particular , our findings of an induced exponential growth of fermion occupation number is distinct from the mechanism of resonant fermion production due to an oscillating inflaton field  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the observed power - law behavior at high momenta is shown to be a consequence of quantum fluctuations beyond mass - like corrections , which are absent for the considered massless fermions because of chiral symmetry .",
    "it will be an important further step beyond our current work to include non - vanishing macroscopic field values , in order to estimate the importance of quantum corrections to the dirac equation in the presence of classical fields .",

    "this production mechanism is based on the exponential growth of long - wavelength boson occupation numbers following a nonequilibrium instability .",
    "a major characteristic property is that the amplification of fermion occupation numbers is approximately momentum - independent and proceeds with the maximum primary growth rate of boson modes .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath232 of the square of the yukawa coupling and the boson self - coupling , the end of the exponential amplification of fermion modes is either determined by the end of the boson growth period ( @xmath273 ) , or by reaching the fermi - dirac distribution in the infrared for momenta @xmath250 ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "the latter leads to very fast thermalization of low - momentum modes .",
    "this finding has to be confronted with the extremely slow thermalization of low - momentum bosons , which are still far from equilibrium at this time .",
    "the slowing - down of the boson dynamics after the exponential growth period is shown to be associated to the approach to a nonthermal infrared fixed point .",
    "it is characterized by scaling of occupation number modes @xmath274 , which lead to strongly enhanced fluctuations in the infrared as compared to a thermal low - momentum distribution @xmath275 .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that such a fixed point is approached in scalar models after a parametric resonance instability , which can prevent or substantially delay thermalization . here",
    "we have demonstrated that a spinodal / tachyonic instability leads to scaling with the same occupation number exponent , which suggests that this is a universal phenomenon of nonequilibrium instability dynamics .",
    "we note that for the spinodal / tachyonic instability and the considered range of parameters we seem not to observe the expected phenomenon of perturbative kolmogorov wave turbulence at higher momenta  @xcite . instead boson modes with momenta @xmath276 exhibit thermal properties at this stage .",
    "fermion occupation number modes are bounded from above , which preempts infrared scaling solutions .",
    "we have explicitly verified that the absence of a scaling regime for fermions at low momenta does not affect the infrared scaling behavior observed for bosons . in general",
    "we find that the boson dynamics is rather insensitive to the presence of fermions for not too large yukawa coupling @xmath277 , which is expected because of the comparably large boson occupation numbers . despite the absence of an infrared scaling regime for fermions",
    ", we find a power - law behavior with exponent two for higher momenta @xmath276 .",
    "its origin is very distinct from the physics underlying nonthermal fixed points .",
    "the latter appear at late times and can be described as stationary points of time evolution equations that are independent of the initial conditions .",
    "in contrast , we could show that the observed fermion power - law behavior emerges at very early times and is a consequence of a retardation or memory effect .",
    "this power - law leads to an excess of highly energetic particles compared to thermal distributions .",
    "it is remarkable that for the considered model these nonlinear out - of - equilibrium phenomena can be studied numerically  and to a large extent analytically  using 2pi effective action techniques directly in quantum field theory .",
    "an important improvement would be to include a macroscopic field into our analysis , in order to estimate the importance of quantum corrections to frequently employed approximations based on the dirac equation in the presence of classical fields .",
