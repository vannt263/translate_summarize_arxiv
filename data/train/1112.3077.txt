    "the ringdown radiation consists of a superposition of , in principle , an infinite number of essentially damped sinusoids , termed quasi - normal modes .",
    "their frequencies and time - constants depend only on the mass and spin of the bh  a consequence of the _ no - hair _ theorem @xcite . in a recent work @xcite we have argued that the amplitude terms of the various quasi - normal modes encode important information about the origin of the perturbation that caused them , such as the component masses of the progenitor binary .",
    "this allows performing parameter estimation on the system from the strong - field regime , as opposed to using the inspiral phase .",
    "however , in that study , as well as in previous studies of parameter estimation from ringdown signals @xcite , only a small region of the parameter space was explored . in a realistic scenario ,",
    "a bh ringdown signal can have any sky location and polarization .",
    "all the while , it could have originated from a bh with any spin - axis orientation with respect to earth .",
    "these variables have a significant effect on the observed ringdown signal and a direct impact on the science we can achieve by observing gws from merged bhs .    in the present study ,",
    "i have investigated in detail how these angular parameters affect the detection and measurement of the ringdown signals . to this end , i have varied the angular parameters over their full range , thereby considering a large population of bh mergers .",
    "i have considered supermassive bhs ( smbhs of mass @xmath0 ) visible in ngo and intermediate mass bhs ( imbhs of mass @xmath1 ) observable in et and aligo .",
    "i have computed the probability distribution functions of signal to noise ratios ( snr ) , as well as measurement errors of a chosen set of parameters , for a wide range of the bh mass and for mass ratios between 2 and 20 .",
    "finally , i translate these probabilities to proportions of observed events in ngo and et that will yield parameter errors below certain thresholds and discuss how observations of ringdown signals could help in dealing with open questions on the existence and history of smbhs and imbhs .    ,",

    "i will discuss the signal model and the parameter space covered in this study .",
    "in the generic case where we have a network of detectors , we write the response to a ringdown signal as : @xmath7    where the superscript @xmath8 is an index denoting the detector in question and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the frequencies and time - constants of each mode , which are functions of the mass and spin magnitude of the bh . for further reference , see @xcite . in this study",

    "the effective amplitudes @xmath14 vary inversely with the luminosity distance and proportionally to the intrinsic amplitudes @xmath18 of the modes , which are determined by the numerical simulations .",
    "the angular functions @xmath23 are the following combinations of the spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xcite : @xmath24    the antenna pattern functions are functions of the sky location coordinates , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the polarization angle @xmath27 , that is , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the spheroidal harmonics are angular functions of the inclination angle , @xmath30 and the azimuth angle @xmath26 .",
    "the first refers to the angle formed by the bh s spin angular momentum and the line - of - sight , while the latter is the azimuth angle defined in a non - rotating frame fixed to the bh .",
    "the ringdown waveform used is of the form described by eqs.([eq : reduced response])-([eq : gammalm ] ) .",
    "it is a signal comprised of four modes , with mode indices @xmath31 .",
    "our choice is based on the ordering of the various modes according to power output , as determined from numerical simulations of non - spinning unequal mass binaries @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of merging black - hole binaries were performed using the bam code @xcite , so as to obtain the amplitudes , @xmath18 of the various modes in eq.([eq : blm ] ) , as well as their frequencies and time - constants ( see also table i of @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations involve the case of _ initially non - spinning _ bhs in quasi - circular orbits and for different mass ratios of the binary .",
    "for the mass ratios , @xmath32 the simulation results were first presented in @xcite , while an additional simulation of a @xmath33 binary was carried out in @xcite .",
    "the amplitude terms @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ eq : blm ] , are given by the expressions :    @xmath34    these constitute fits , that were produced by fitting the merger - ringdown part of the numerical simulations data , taking into account all the different mass ratios for which these were performed .",
    "all points in a time region beginning at the peak luminosity of @xmath6 and ending 30@xmath5 later were considered , for each mass ratio .",
    "as opposed to the method that was applied in our previous work @xcite , where the relative amplitude values at 10@xmath5 were used , this approach is expected to be more robust and to average out any numerical noise that might be present in this part of the waveform . nevertheless , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : relampl ] , these two methods do not give very different results . note also that the above fitting functions , as well as the mode frequencies and time - constants , may be less accurate in the higher mass ratio values of around 20 , where extrapolation has been performed .      in ref .",
    "@xcite we had ignored the effect of the various angles @xmath35 on the quasi - normal mode spectrum and their impact on the detection and measurement of ringdown signals . to assess this effect ,",
    "the aforementioned analysis was repeated by varying the angular parameters @xmath35 .",
    "specifically , six uniformly spaced values were chosen for these angles .",
    "this results in @xmath36 distinct relative orientations between the detector and the bh and its spin axis .",
    "additionally , a couple of simulations with eight uniformly spaced values were performed , that is @xmath37 configurations , to allow the comparison .",
    "hence , it was decided that six values in each parameter was acceptable in capturing the behaviour of the observable quantities .",
    "the values in the polarization angle , @xmath27 and the azimuth sky location angle , @xmath38 were linearly sampled in the ranges @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] respectively . whereas , the values in the inclination angle @xmath30 and sky position , @xmath25 - which range from 0 to @xmath41 - are deduced from the uniformly spaced values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the range @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "note that this excludes configurations of optimally oriented binaries , that is of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the existence of intermediate - mass black holes remains uncertain , as is their mass distribution .",
    "colliding globular clusters in interacting galaxies could be a mechanism to obtain a compact binary imbh system @xcite .",
    "another possibility could be the formation of a binary imbh inside a young dense stellar cluster , especially when the fraction of binary stars is adequately high @xcite .",
    "estimates of imbh - imbh coalescence rates can be found in @xcite .",
    "a relatively optimistic rate is @xmath47 0.007 @xmath48 , where it has been assumed that @xmath49 of star clusters are sufficiently massive and have a sufficient stellar binary fraction to form an imbh - imbh binary once in their lifetime , taken at 13.8 gyr .",
    "the maximum possible rate would come from assuming that all of the star clusters satisfied the above conditions .",
    "the corresponding rate value is then @xmath50 0.07 @xmath48 .",
    "if the number of relatively luminous galaxies within a distance of 1 gpc is approximately @xmath51 , @xcite and the number of young dense stellar clusters per such galaxy is of the order of 100 , then the optimistic estimate gives 0.037 events per year , while the maximum rate would be 0.37 events per year .",
    "an event within this distance will in some likelihood , involve imbhs with masses between @xmath52 and @xmath53 which means a relatively fair chance for errors to be low for several of the parameters using einstein telescope ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:6e2 ] , [ fig:1e3 ] ) .",
    "the present study constitutes a sensible and realistic approach to the subject of parameter estimation from a multimodal ringdown signal , inasmuch as it is supposed to be emitted from a merged binary in a generic configuration .",
    "parameters such as the inclination angle @xmath30 , along with the sky location @xmath25 and @xmath38 and the signal polarization @xmath27 have an effect on the observed quasi - normal mode spectrum .",
    "their impact on the detectability and parameter estimation has been assessed , by performing a large sample of fisher - matrix analysis simulations , allowing for a simple statistical analysis of the results .",
    "i am quoting frequency distributions for the errors at the representative distances of @xmath54 ( 6.73 gpc ) for supermassive bhs , in ngo , and of @xmath55 ( 1 gpc ) for intermediate - mass bhs , in the einstein telescope and advanced ligo .",
    "an additional simulation was performed for a @xmath56 bh at @xmath57 .",
    "the results are quite satisfactory in determining the mass and spin , especially for the low mass ratios from 1 to @xmath58 , where in typically @xmath59 of the cases their errors fall below @xmath49 .",
    "the effectiveness in measuring the luminosity distance , mass ratio and inclination angle is almost an order of magnitude worse .",
    "the effects of these results on , as much as possible , realistic event rates in ngo and et are discussed .",
    "the likelihood to have a waveform parameter measured to an accuracy of a certain threshold translates to the same proportion of observed events featuring error values below that threshold . as an example , if supermassive bhs within a luminosity distance of @xmath60 coalesce at a rate of @xmath61 , then ngo could act as a smbh dynamics probe , as almost all of these events will yield very low errors @xmath62 in the bh mass and spin , while in half of the events the errors in the luminosity distance , mass ratio and inclination angle will be of the order of @xmath63 .",
