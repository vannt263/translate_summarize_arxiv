    "for a knot @xmath0 in the @xmath1-sphere @xmath2 , the minimum number of crossings of a diagram among all diagrams of @xmath0 is called the _ crossing number_.",
    "this is one of the most basic topological complexities of a knot .",
    "another complexity of knots which we consider in this paper is the diameter of the set of boundary slopes .",
    "let @xmath3 be the exterior of @xmath0 .",
    "a compact connected surface properly embedded in @xmath3 is said to be _ essential _ if the surface is incompressible and boundary - incompressible .",
    "the boundary of an essential surface appears on @xmath4 as a parallel family of non - trivial simple closed curves , and so , it determines an isotopy class of the curves , which is called the _ boundary slope _ of the surface . recall that the set of slopes is identified with the set of rational numbers with @xmath5 , where the meridian of @xmath0 corresponds to @xmath5 , by using the standard meridian - longitude system for @xmath0 .",
    "then _ the diameter of the set of boundary slopes for @xmath0 _ is defined as the difference between the greatest one and the least one as rational numbers , except for the infinity ( i.e. , meridional ) slope .",
    "this is well - defined since it is known that there are only finitely many boundary slopes @xcite and there exist at least two boundary slopes in general @xcite .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ thm : crossingnumberanddiameter : main ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a montesinos knot without @xmath6-tangles .",
    "then , we have @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the crossing number of @xmath0 and @xmath9 denotes the diameter of the set of boundary slopes for @xmath0 .",
    "the equality holds if @xmath0 is alternating .",
    "it is probable that this inequality holds for all knots in general .",
    "for example , it is easily verified for torus knots . for a non - trivial torus knot",
    "@xmath10 , assuming that @xmath11 are relatively prime with @xmath12 , it is known that the boundary slopes are @xmath13 and @xmath14 while the crossing number is @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath16 .",
    "the equality holds when @xmath17 , equivalently , the knot is alternating .",
    "moreover , as far as the authors observed , the equality holds for all alternating knots .",
    "we here remark that , for alternating knots , the converse inequality @xmath18 can be shown . by the checkerboard construction for the reduced alternating diagram ,",
    "we can obtain two surfaces , which are both essential by @xcite , and the difference between their boundary slopes is actually @xmath19 .    to prove the theorem",
    ", we mainly use the algorithm given by hatcher and oertel in @xcite , which enumerates all boundary slopes for a given montesinos knot . the algorithm in turn",
    "is based on the algorithm by hatcher and thurston in @xcite , which enumerates all boundary slopes for a two - bridge knot .",
    "another ingredient is the way to calculate the crossing number of a given montesinos knot obtained by lickorish and thistlethwaite in @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce some notation and terminology .",
    "then , we prove the main theorem in the last section .",
    "the authors would like to thank masaharu ishikawa for suggesting the potential relationship between the crossing number and the diameter of the set of boundary slopes .",
    "they also thank to thomas mattman for letting them know the work @xcite .",
    "they are grateful to the referee for careful reading of the manuscript and useful comments",
    "in this section , we prepare various notations and recall fundamentals .",
    "we start with a _ rational tangle _ , which we regard as follows . see figure [ fig:1over2-tangle ] .",
    "the left figure illustrates a sphere with four punctures , which is flattened like a `` pillowcase '' .",
    "consecutive segments with slope @xmath20 are drawn from each of four punctures .",
    "these segments form two arcs .",
    "think about the interior of the sphere , and push these two arcs into the interior with four ends fixed .",
    "see the right figure in figure [ fig:1over2-tangle ] .",
    "then , we have a @xmath20-tangle in a @xmath1-ball .",
    "similarly , we can obtain a @xmath21-tangle for arbitrary irreducible fraction @xmath21 including @xmath6 .",
    "( 140,65 ) ( 0,8 ) ( 80,0 )    a _ montesinos knot _ is defined as a knot obtained by putting rational tangles together in a circle .",

    "however , in this paper , we want to only consider montesinos knots ; the number of components is one .",
    "thus we assume that the tuple must satisfy either of the two conditions ; ( a ) exactly one of the denominators of @xmath30 s is even or ( b ) all denominators of @xmath30 s are odd and",

    "* we always assume that none of @xmath30 s are @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , we always assume @xmath31 since if the number of tangles is two or less , the knot is found to be a two - bridge knot .",
    "for the two - bridge knots , a result corresponding to the main theorem in this paper has been presented by mattman , maybrun and robinson in @xcite .",
