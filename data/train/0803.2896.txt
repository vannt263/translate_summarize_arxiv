    "the strength of the lopsidedness does not correlate with the presence of companions but , instead , correlates with the presence of bars and spiral arms .",
    "they explore three different causes for the lopsidedness : galaxy interactions , galaxy mergers , and gas accretion .",
    "these authors favour the latter explanation , which indeed can trigger strong lopsidedness if the gas in - fall is sufficiently asymmetric .",
    "@xcite analysed hi surface density maps and r - band images of 18 galaxies in the eridanus group .",
    "all galaxies showed significant lopsidedness in their hi discs . where the stellar and gaseous discs overlap , their asymmetries are comparably strong . since the eridanus",
    "group galaxies are more strongly lopsided than field galaxies , these authors conclude that tidal interaction in the group environment may contribute to generating lopsidedness in disc galaxies .",
    "@xcite studied kinematic lopsidedness in two spiral galaxies and argued that it may be related to lopsidedness in the potential .",
    "alternatively , the stellar disc may lie off - centre in the halo s gravitational potential well and spin in a sense retrograde to its orbit about the halo centre @xcite .",
    "lopsided structures are not the prerogative of disc galaxies alone . in some nucleated dwarf",
    "elliptical galaxies , for instance , the nucleus is displaced with respect to the centre of the outer isophotes @xcite .",
    "while some authors regard these displaced nuclei as being globular clusters projected close to the galaxy photocenter @xcite , in some cases , such as the fornax dwarf elliptical fcc046 , there are clear indications that the nucleus is an integral part of the galaxy s stellar body and is displaced by a mechanism that affects the whole galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite used n - body simulations to investigate the stability of a family of oblate elliptical galaxy models and found that a strong lopsided instability occurs in models with small radial anisotropy and strong counter - rotation .",
    "this instability may cause lopsidedness in stellar systems with no or small net rotation , such as dwarf ellipticals @xcite .",
    "@xcite compiled a list of several types of counter - rotation in galaxies of different morphological type .",

    "it is clear that the mechanism that is responsible for triggering the lopsided mode in the counter - rotating model relies heavily on virtually all stars moving on near - circular orbits .",

    "a butterfly can be viewed as a librating elliptical orbit with variable eccentricity . at the turning points of the libration ,",
    "the orbit ellipticity becomes zero ( this is evidenced by the red , green , and blue ellipses in fig . [ fig6]a ) .",
    "as the angular momentum of the orbit is increased up to a critical point @xmath97 , the two instances of zero ellipse orbit ellipticity coincide and the orbit fills an elliptical region . for still higher angular momentum , libration becomes rotation and the orbit becomes a loop , as can be seen in fig .",

    "it is clear from their formulation that these two orbit families are associated with the cusps having diverging central densities which is why we do not find them in our models .",
    "the mechanism that causes the non - rotating @xmath0 mode is now clear : an infinitesimal @xmath0 perturbation will cause near - circular orbits to become somewhat more elliptic and to shift towards the slight overdensity , thus adding to this over - density , which in turn causes other orbits to become more elongated and to shift , and so on .",
    "this was already evident from section 3.3  3(a ) of @xcite who used perturbation theory in combination with the epicyclic approximation to calculate the response of near - circular orbits to a general @xmath45-armed perturbation . since this perturbation has no lindblad resonances , the condition that the sign of the quantity @xmath98 ( represented by the red curve in fig .",

    "the difference between the density distribution of the perturbed orbit and that of the unperturbed orbit gives an idea of how the density of a galaxy made up of an ensemble of unperturbed orbits will change under the influence of the given perturbation . in fig .",

    "( [ testpert ] ) ; i.e. , we plot the quantity @xmath118 where the sum runs over an ensemble of circular unperturbed orbits with different radii and with the phases of the starting points of the orbit integrations distributed uniformly over the interval [ 0,2@xmath119 [ ( circles in fig . [",

    "negative values of @xmath116 are coloured black / blue ; positive values in white / yellow . clearly , the regions where @xmath120 coincide with the over - densities of the @xmath0 mode ( full line contours ) whereas the regions where @xmath121 coincide with the mode s under - densities ( dotted line contours ) .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig7]b that the radial orbits are not nearly as cooperative despite the fact that they are slightly displaced towards the inner overdensity . as an ensemble",
    ", they do not react to the imposed perturbation in a way that would tend to strengthen it since their long axes are oriented perpendicularly to the inner lopsidedness leading rather to a @xmath70 feature . the ( near-)circular orbits are clearly the backbone of this @xmath0 mode and , as we know from fig . [",
    "fig4]a , even a smidgen of stars on radial orbits is enough to stabilise the system against this instability .          in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we present five perturbed stellar orbits that occupy the region in which the density perturbation due to the rotating lopsided mode is maximal .",
    "the orbits are plotted in a reference frame that rotates with the pattern speed of the @xmath0 mode .",
    "again we observe loop orbits that are displaced into the direction of the over - density and that can support the lopsided structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig8]a & [ fig8]b ) . at larger radii ,",
    "the stellar orbits attain a banana shape in this reference frame . these orbits occupy a region outside the mode s main under - density and seem to be connected to the one - armed spiral ( fig .",
    "[ fig8]c , [ fig8]d & [ fig8]e ) .",
    "unlike in the previous case , where aligned loop orbits were almost solely responsible for creating the instability , here the two orbit families fulfil different tasks .",
    "the aligned loop orbits support the inner lobes of the lopsided structure whereas the banana orbits make up the outer one - armed spiral .          for the lopsided mode with pattern speed @xmath122 , the quantity @xmath123 from @xcite",
    "becomes : @xmath124 the sign of @xmath101 again traces that of the orbit displacement and , with less fidelity , of the density perturbation ( fig .",
    "[ fig8b]a ) .",
    "orbits inside the corotation radius are shifted into the direction of the overdensity @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig8b]b ) . at corotation",
    ", @xmath101 diverges .",
    "orbits near corotation become banana orbits .",
    "the corotation radius of the mode is at @xmath126 kpc , which coincides with the position of the one - armed spiral .",
    "outside corotation , the sign of @xmath101 changes and orbits are shifted into the other direction ( fig . [ fig8b]c ) .",
    "the interpretation of this instability in terms of waves is somewhat subtle . in the case of a bar instability",
    ", the radial extent of the @xmath70 pattern is determined by the largest radius out to which the most slowly rotating wave that avoids having an inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) can travel .",
    "this constraint sets the size of the resonance cavity within which the pattern can grow by swing amplification . however , one - armed waves do not have an ilr , irrespective of their pattern speed .",
    "the radial extent of the @xmath0 pattern is set by the largest radius out to which non - rotating wave packets can travel .",
    "this radius is determined by the disc s dispersion relation .",
    "we used the wkb dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "( 6 - 46 ) of @xcite or eq .",
    "( 12.82 ) of @xcite ) together with the @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 profiles of the @xmath79 model to estimate the region in which non - rotating one - armed waves are allowed to exist .",
    "the @xmath110 profile of the fully rotating @xmath79 model rises outwardly , limiting the extent of non - rotating waves to some finite radius , well within the disc . in the case of the @xmath79 model , for a zero pattern speed",
    ", the dispersion relation has two branches ( the long - wave and the short - wave branch ) of incoming and outgoing leading and trailing waves for radii smaller than approximately 1.7  kpc .",
    "this sets the dimension of the resonance cavity within which the pattern can grow through swing amplification .",
    "all @xmath0 waves can propagate into the galaxy center where incoming trailing wave packets are reflected as outgoing leading wave packets , closing the feedback loop .",
    "moreover , a more steeply rising rotation curve will suppress the @xmath70 mode while leaving the @xmath0 mode , which has no inner lindblad resonance , largely intact .",
    "thus , following @xcite who already proposed this mechanism as the cause of the @xmath0 modes found in cut - out power - law discs , we propose swing amplification as the physical cause of the one - armed mode in this rotating model .       mode .",
    "panel ( a ) : an ensemble of circular unperturbed orbits ; panel ( b ) : an ensemble of radial unperturbed orbits .",
    "negative values are coloured black / blue ; positive values in white / yellow . the contours of the perturbed density of the @xmath0 mode are also plotted ( solid line : over - density , dotted line : under - density),width=321 ]    [ width=17 cm ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we show how the density distribution , i.e. the quantity @xmath116 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ dro ] ) , of an ensemble of circular ( panel ( a ) ) and of radial ( panel ( b ) ) orbits changes due to the rotating @xmath0 mode .",
    "we now see that the circular orbits and the radial orbits both support the lopsided structure .",
    "this is because radial orbits as well as the inner circular orbits become loop orbits that are aligned with the lopsided mode .",
    "if we change the fraction of stars on radial orbits , we have a slower stabilisation of the @xmath0 mode than in the non - rotating models ( see fig . [ fig4]a ) .",
    ": white ( @xmath127 ) , purple ( @xmath128 ) , cyan ( @xmath129 ) , yellow ( @xmath130 ) , black ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "the effective potential is also shown ( increasing from white to blue).,width=188 ]    we have integrated a number of stellar orbits that all start at the corotation radius @xmath132 with phases @xmath133 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] where we also showed the effective potential @xmath134 all banana orbits evolve around the stable lagrange point of the system which is located at the local maximum of the effective potential at a phase angle @xmath135 . in the corotating reference frame , a star at position ( @xmath136 ) will remain there forever .",
    "orbits started at corotation but with different phase angles will trace out a banana - shaped curve .",
    "the further away from the equilibrium point @xmath137 an orbit is started , the more elongated the banana becomes .",
    "the orbit started at @xmath138 is circular in the corotating reference frame .",
    "the origin of the one - armed spiral now becomes more clear .",
    "a weak , rotating lopsided perturbation will catch stars close to the ( @xmath136 ) lagrange point on banana orbits .",
    "these then spend more time near the stable lagrange point , creating an over - density there , and less time near the diametrically opposite point , creating an under - density there .",
    "thus , the banana orbits help strengthen the lopsided mode , causing more stars to be trapped in banana orbits , and so on .",
    "using a toy dynamical model , we have investigated the properties and causes of dynamical instabilities that may cause lopsidedness in disc galaxies .",
    "we found the well - known _ counter - rotation instability _ to be the dominant mode in disc galaxy models with strong counter - rotation and small radial anisotropy .",
    "it is much stronger than any @xmath70 mode we found in these models .",
    "the strength of this mode diminishes in models with less counter - rotation and it eventually disappears in fully rotating models . these , however , develop a different type of lopsided mode , that becomes stronger as rotation increases , although it is always much weaker than the @xmath70 spiral - arm mode .",
    "this instability bears strong resemblance to the _ eccentricity instability _ that is known to occur in gaseous and stellar near - keplerian discs orbiting a central massive object .",
    "we provide the first theoretical evidence , based on a thorough mode - analysis of a suite of dynamical models for disc galaxies embedded in a dark halo , that the eccentricity instability can also occur in the fully pro - grade stellar discs of spiral galaxies .    by integrating the orbits of an ensemble of stars in the perturbed potential of the two extreme cases of full counter - rotation on the one hand and full prograde rotation on the other hand",
    ", we investigated the physics underlying the counter - rotation and eccentricity instability .",
    "the counter - rotation instability grows by changing near - circular orbits into aligned loop orbits that help maintain a lopsided structure . if the non - linear regime , radial orbits are changed into butterfly orbits . in the case of the eccentricity mode , both radial and tangential orbits become aligned loops in a corotating reference frame . in the non - linear regime ,",
    "orbits near corotation are trapped into resonance and describe banana - shaped figures in a corotating frame .",
    "they help support the characteristic one - armed spiral .    in terms of density waves ,",
    "the counter - rotating @xmath0 mode is most likely due to a purely growing jeans - type instability .",
    "an approximative analytical criterion for local stability , akin to toomre s stability criterion for axisymmetric waves , can be employed to estimate the region in which purely growing one - armed waves may develop .",
    "this estimate roughly coincides with the region in which the non - rotating lopsided mode is observed to reside .",
    "the rotating @xmath0 mode , on the other hand , grows as a result of the swing amplifier working inside the resonance cavity that extends from the disc center out to the radius where non - rotating rotating waves are stabilized by the model s outwardly rising @xmath1-profile .",
    "rotating waves are confined to even smaller radii so the non - rotating waves effectively set the outer boundary of the resonance cavity .",
    "many disc galaxies show a noticeable @xmath0 perturbation besides the dominant @xmath70 spiral - arm mode but only very few of them show any counter - rotation .",
    "the rotating lopsided mode we identified in fully prograde disc models therefore forms an attractive explanation for this observed phenomenon .",
