    "comets are cold icy bodies in the solar system that were formed in the solar nebula and are considered to be the signature bodies to understand the formation of the solar system .",
    "as the comet nucleus makes its journey towards its parent star , the ices start sublimating giving rise to a mixture of gas and dust which form the coma . for comets at heliocentric distances less than 3 au ,",
    "the visible band spectrum shows strong molecular emission bands riding on the continuum radiation scattered by the cometary dust .",
    "studying these molecular emission bands has been an important part of the cometary study .",
    "+ comet c/2014 q2 ( lovejoy ) , an oort cloud comet , was discovered by terry lovejoy in august 2014 using an 8 inch telescope when the comet had a visual magnitude of 15 .",
    "the comet brightened to a magnitude of 4 in the visual band in january 2015 being closest to earth at 0.469 au on january 7 .",
    "the comet s perihelion was on the 30th of january 2015 at a heliocentric distance of 1.29 au .",
    "according to the data from jpl horizons database , the comet orbit has an eccentricity of 0.9976 , orbital inclination of 80.3@xmath3 , semi - major axis of 576.34 au and orbital period of 13700 years .",
    "+ @xcite have carried out a detailed survey of 85 comets during the years 1976 - 1992 .",
    "they have studied the variation of gas production rates and dust to gas ratio with heliocentric distances .",
    "they have defined certain limits in the gas ratios in order to classify the comets as to whether they are depleted in carbon - chain molecules or not . according to their study ,",
    "most of the carbon depleted comets are from the jupiter family .",
    "they also say that cn is produced from the nucleus as well as from the dust in the comet s coma .",
    "several spectroscopic surveys have been carried out , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . @xcite",
    "have spectroscopically studied five comets .",
    "they found a linear correlation between production rates of c@xmath4 , c@xmath5 and c@xmath1 with respect to cn .",
    "no correlation was found between the production rate ratios and heliocentric distance . @xcite",
    "have given new statistical methods in cometary spectroscopy for the extraction and subtraction of the sky using the comet frames itself .",
    "they have given a dynamical classification of comets by studying 26 different comets .",
    "more recently , @xcite have compiled and reported the spectroscopic results for 130 comets observed from mcdonald observatory .",
    "they have found remarkable similarity in the composition of most of the comets .",
    "they quote that the carbon chain depleted comets can be from any dynamical class .",
    "however they have not found any of them from the halley type comets ( tisserand parameter @xmath6 2 and period @xmath6 200 years ) due to significantly low number of these types in their sample . + in our study of comet c/2014 q2 , we have determined the production rates for various gas species , @xmath2 and dust to gas ratios at different heliocentric distances .",
    "the observations were carried out with lisa spectrograph mounted on the 0.5 m(f/6.8 ) telescope ( planewave instruments cdk20 ) at the mount abu infra - red observatory ( miro ) , mount abu , india . @xcite",
    "have given a brief overview of the telescope at the observatory . in the following we describe , briefly , the spectrograph and comet observations .",
    "lisais a low resolution high luminosity spectrograph which is designed for the spectroscopic study of faint and extended objects .",
    "the light from the object that passes through the slit falls on the grating .",
    "the rest of the light is reflected towards the guiding ccd camera .",
    "two detector cameras are placed on either side of the spectrograph : atik 314l is used for acquiring the object spectrum .",
    "this has a chip size of 1392 x 1040 pixels where each is a square pixel of size 6.45 @xmath7 .",
    "the light that passes through the slit is reflected by the mirror and is transformed into a parallel beam by a collimator .",
    "this is then diffracted by the grating and then passes through the objective lens and gets converged onto the detector . as the focal length of the collimator is 130 mm and that of the camera lens is 88 mm , the image on the slit plane is multiplied by a factor of 88/130=0.68 onto the plane of the ccd .",
    "the second detector is atik titan guiding camera .",
    "this has a chip size of 659 x 494 pixels where each is a square pixel of size 7.4 @xmath7 .",
    "all the reflected light that does not pass through the slit is directed to the guiding mirror .",
    "this is then sent to the guiding optics which refocuses the light on to the guiding camera .",
    "there are 8 different slits that are provided with the instrument .",
    "we have used a slit width of 1.37 arcsec for january and february , and a slit width of 2.08 arcsec for march and may observations .",
    "grating with 300 grooves / mm was used covering a total wavelength range from @xmath8 3800 @xmath9 to @xmath8 7400 @xmath9 with a wavelength scale of 2.6 @xmath9 per pixel .",
    "the plate scale on the ccd plane is 0.57 arcsec per pixel .",
    "the length of the slit imaged onto the ccd plane is 130 arcsec .",
    "we carried out spectroscopic observations from mount abu infra - red observatory ( miro ) using lisa , a low resolution spectrograph mounted on the 0.5 m telescope during january to may 2015 .",
    "the sky conditions were photometric during the observing period .",
    "bias images were taken at regular intervals .",
    "the slit was assumed to be uniformly illuminated . with this assumption ,",
    "lamp flats were taken after every round of observation .",
    "this was used for flat field corrections .",
    "an argon - neon lamp was used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "details of the comet observations are given in table [ comet_obs ] .",
    "the exposure times mentioned in the table are for each individual frame .",
    "the slit was placed at the photo - center of the comet and was manually tracked through the guiding ccd throughout the exposure time .",
    "the observations were made using the scheme , sky - object - sky , for the proper background sky subtraction .",
    "the standard stars ( along with their spectral types ) from iraf s catalogue of spectroscopic standardsobserved for flux calibration are as follows : hd15318(b9 ) , hd19445 ( g2v ) , hr1544(a1 ) , hd126991(g2v ) , hd129357(g2v ) , hd140514(g2v ) , hr7596(a0 ) , hd192281(o4.5 ) , hd217086(o7 ) .",
    "these were preferably observed at a similar airmass as that of the comet .",

    "it is interesting to note the simultaneous increase in gas and dust which indicates an increase in the overall activity of the comet after its perihelion passage .",
    "this kind of asymmetry has been seen in many comets .",
    "in fact @xcite have tabulated the difference in the pre and post perihelion values for different class of comets with positive values indicating post perihelion activity .",
    "although we do not have data points at exactly the same distance for pre and post perihelion passages , we can perhaps say that this comet may have a large positive asymmetry .",
    "this indicates that there might be volatile material present beneath the surface of the comet or the surface of the nucleus consists of layers of ice that have different vaporization rates .",
    "we have carried out spectral study of the comet c/2014 q2 ( lovejoy ) which shows strong emission lines of c@xmath0 , c@xmath1 and cn .",
    "the molecular production rates and the quantity af@xmath11 are estimated .",
    "we arrive at the following conclusions :    * the comet shows a large positive asymmetry , which indicates increase in the post - perihelion activity . * considering the limits set by @xcite for the carbon abundance , c/2014 q2 is found to be in the typical class of comets . *",
    "the dust to gas ratio remains fairly constant within the observed heliocentric range which is in agreement with @xcite * the @xmath2 values indicate that the dust distribution favours smaller dust particles near perihelion which depletes as the comet moves away .",
    "* new haser model scale lengths were obtained which best fit the observed data .",
    "these differ significantly from the previously quoted values .",
    "this might be due to the comet s intrinsic nature itself or affected by the solar activity at the time of observation .",
    "a more exhaustive study is required to confirm some of the conclusions drawn here .",
