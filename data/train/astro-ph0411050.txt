    "one of the outstanding issues in cosmology is to understand the reionization of the universe .",
    "following recombination of primordial plasma at redshift @xmath0 , the universe is mostly neutral with an ionization fraction @xmath1 ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . the jean s mass at recombination is @xmath2 . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the plasma thermally decouples from cmbr and its temperature decreases adiabatically , @xmath4 , which leads to a further decrease in jean s mass . during this",
    "dark and cold age the density perturbations at scales above the jean s scale can grow .",
    "figure  1 shows the ionization and thermal history of the universe along with the evolution of jeans mass .",
    "this age comes to an end when the first structures can collapse and the light from these objects can reionize and reheat the universe ( for a recent review see @xcite and references therein ) . therefore the epoch of re - ionization holds important clues about the way first structures formed and can potentially distinguish between different models of structure formation . in the standard @xmath5 models",
    "the first structures to collapse would be just above the jean s length ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another crucial question in this regard is whether these structures could cool fast enough to form stars .",
    "many of these issues will be discussed in this review .",
    "different ongoing and potential probes of intergalactic medium can reveal the nature of the re - ionization of the universe .",
    "one of the most important and the oldest is the gunn - peterson test ( see e.g. @xcite and reference therein ) , which is very sensitive to the neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium .",
    "cmbr anisotropy measurements are another powerful and complementary probe , as they are sensitive to the ionized component of the intergalactic medium ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in future",
    ", it might be possible to directly observe the first sources that re - ionize the universe .",
    "in addition , the transition from neutral to ionized universe might also be detected in neutral hydrogen emission ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    to sum up the observational status : recent detection of temperature - polarization cross - correlation in cmbr suggests that the redshift of reionization @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "gunn - peterson probes suggest that the universe is highly ionized upto @xmath7 , but might be making a transition from highly ionized to neutral for @xmath8 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these two observations together throw open the interesting possibility that the universe went through two phases of re - ionization .",
    "this article is divided into two parts . in the first part , probes that give a clue about the reionization epoch will be discussed . in the second part",
    ", we will discuss the nature of ionizing sources . throughout this review we use the currently - favoured frw model : spatially flat with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) with @xmath11 @xcite , @xcite ) and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "high redshift sources should show absorption at frequencies close to lyman-@xmath13 ( 1216  @xmath14 ) line owing to scattering from igm neutral hydrogen ( hi ) .",
    "this test applied to high redshift quasars which generally have a strong lyman-@xmath13 emission line means that the blueward side of the lyman-@xmath13 line should show strong absorption as compared to the redward side ( gunn - peterson ( gp ) test ) .",
    "the optical depth to the lyman-@xmath13 scattering from hi can be calculated ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath15 here @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the neutral fraction of hydrogen and @xmath18 .",
    "two points worth noting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpt ] ) are : ( 1 ) owing to the resonant nature of lyman-@xmath13 scattering , optical depth at observed frequency @xmath19 gives direct information about the neutral fraction at redshift @xmath20 , and ( 2 ) more importantly , this test is extremely sensitive to the neutral fraction of hydrogen , even a neutral fraction as small as a part in hundred thousand can fully absorb light shortward of lyman-@xmath13 in the quasar spectrum .    since 1960s",
    "when the first high redshift quasars whose lyman-@xmath13 emission could be detected from ground - based telescopes were discovered , gp test has been applied to study the ionization of the universe at high redshifts . till 2000 , none of the observed quasars upto a redshift @xmath21 showed any gp absorption , which means the universe is ionized to better than a part in a million upto @xmath7 .",
    "the discovery of several quasars at redshifts above six by sdss survey made it possible to apply gp tests at even higher redshifts .",
    "gp absorption has been detected in several quasars at redshifts @xmath22 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "observations suggest that the neutral fraction increases rapidly between @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these observations might mean that the universe is becoming ionized owing to the formation of the first structures at @xmath25 .",
    "however a straightforward interpretation of these results is not easy . even for the best quasar spectrum and using the lyman-@xmath26 line , which has a smaller oscillator strength , the gp optical depth @xmath27 ( @xcite ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpt ] ) , this implies that @xmath28 i.e. the universe can be almost fully ionized .",
    "use of semi - analytic models which take into account the clumpiness of the igm give more stringent constraints on the neutral fraction and give @xmath29 at @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "even though the observations are unable to conclude that the universe made a transition from fully ionized to almost fully neutral between redshift of five and six , the ionized fraction certainly evolves very rapidly in this redshift range , and this can have important implications for the models of structure formation .",
    "cmbr anisotropies provide a complementary approach to the ionization history of the universe as compared to the gp test , as they are sensitive to the ionized component of the universe .",
    "the physics of cmbr temperature anisotropies at the last scattering surface and various data analysis issue are covered elsewhere in this volume ( subramanian , this volume ) . here",
    "we shall discuss the implications of reionization on the cmbr temperature anisotropies . to highlight the effect of reionization on the polarization anisotropies we discuss more fully the cmbr polarization anisotropies .",
    "the universe recombines at @xmath0 .",
    "following recombination the ionized fraction ( @xmath30 ) in the universe is @xmath1 for @xmath31 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mean free path of the cmbr photons to thompson scattering exceeds the local hubble radius in the post - recombination era and therefore the universe is transparent to the cmbr photons . following reionization , the ionized fraction might reach nearly unity and a small fraction of cmbr photons might re - scatter again . an important quantity in studying cmbr quantity is visibility function which is the normalized probability that the photon scattered in a range @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath34 , here @xmath35 is the conformal time and @xmath36 . in figure",
    "2 we show the visibility function for two models . for the model with early reionization ,",
    "the visibility function get important contribution from redshift of reionization .",
    "one can define the optical depth to the reionization surface : @xmath37 ; this is the fraction of photons that re - scattered in the reionized universe for @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the temperature and polarization anisotropies can be computed by solving the boltzmann equations for the photon distribution function .",
    "equations appropriate for studying the effect of reionization for scalar perturbations , for a given wavenumber @xmath42 and line of sight @xmath43 , are ( see e.g. @xcite , zalddariaga 1997 , @xcite,@xcite ) : @xmath44 -\\delta_p )   \\label{eq : tpeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the polarization anisotropies @xmath48 are in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath42 vector , which is taken to be parallel to the z - axis , to exploit the axial symmetry of the problem . in this case , only one stokes parameter @xmath49 is non - zero and @xmath50 .",

    "the angular moments of temperature and polarization anisotropies are : @xmath55 .",
    "even though the temperature equation is only appropriate for studying the effect of reionization on anisotropies generated at last scattering surface , the polarization equation is exact and can also be used to study the generation of perturbations at the last scattering surface .    to understand the essential physics of cmbr anisotropies in reionized models , we only solve for anisotropy evolution for one wavenumber @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity measured by experiments is the two point function of this quantity summed over all the wave - numbers ( for details see articles by subramanian , this volume ) .",
    "we begin by studying the effect of reionization on the temperature anisotropies .",
    "eq  ( [ eq : tpeq ] ) can be solved to give : @xmath56 the first term in the solution means the anisotropies generated at the last scattering surface are exponentially damped by reionization ( the solution is only correct for scales smaller than the size of local horizon , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "it is not reflected in the solution owing to dropping a term @xmath58 in the temperature equation ( for details see @xcite ) ) .",
    "for example , if the universe reionized at @xmath59 which gives @xmath60 .i.e .",
    "all the photons from the last scattering surface are re - scattered following reionizatio , this means that all anisotropies at scales smaller than the angular scale correspond to @xmath61 are wiped out . as we shall see",
    "the second term in the solution does nt contribute much to the anisotropies at small scales either .",
    "this means that for a reionization redshift @xmath62 no anisotropies should be observed for @xmath63 , which is in direct contradiction with observations ( e.g. wmap observations detect anisotropies for @xmath64 ) .",
    "therefore the redshift of reionization should be small enough such that only a small fraction of cmbr photons are re - scattered . to compute the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tesol ] ) , we can assume the visibility to be a normalized gaussian with a width @xmath65 , this gives @xmath66\\ ] ] this shows that cmbr anisotropies generated during the epoch of reionization owing to doppler scattering off electrons are suppressed for @xmath67 .",
    "the generated signal as expected is @xmath68 for realistic ionization histories @xmath69 .",
    "we show in figure  3 , the effect of reionization on the temperature anisotropies .",
    "the net effect of reionization on the cmbr temperature anisotropies can be summarized as : ( a ) anisotropies at small scales are suppressed exponentially as @xmath70 , ( b ) anisotropies at scales corresponding to @xmath71 escape this exponential damping and also new anisotropies are generated at these scales . as seen in figure  3 , reionization causes a relative decrease in the small scale anisotropies .",
    "the minimum error in detecting the angular power spectrum of cmbr anisotropies at any @xmath72 is @xmath73 ( cosmic variance ) and for all cmbr anisotropy experiments the error on @xmath74 is dominated by the cosmic variance for @xmath75 .",
    "the reionization signal is very difficult to detect owing to uncertainty in the overall normalization of the cmbr anisotropies which is compounded by cosmic variance . from wmap data all the information about",
    "the reionization comes from the polarization signal .    in second order in perturbation theory ,",
    "reionization causes potentially detectable anisotropies for @xmath76 ; for @xmath77 this signal can dominate the signal from primary anisotropies .",
    "the most important second order contribution to temperature anisotropies comes from vishniac effect ( for details see @xcite , also see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for host of other second order effects ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tpeq ] ) , it can be seen that the source of polarization anisotropy is the quadrupole of the temperature anisotropy .",
    "the generation of temperature and polarization anisotropies at the last scattering surface is generally an involved process and eqs.([eq : tpeq ] ) have to be solved numerically ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , several relevant assumptions allows one to get an analytic insight into the problem ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first simplification occurs because the photon - baryon plasma can be treated as tightly - coupled for most of the period during which the recombination lasts .",
    "the tight coupling approximation is valid for scales corresponding to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the ( comoving ) mean free path of the photons for thompson scattering ; @xmath80 at the last scattering surface for a fully ionized universe , which means that tight coupling approximation is valid for most scales of interest .",
    "( the scale of interest for tight - coupling in not @xmath79 but the scale of photon diffusion at recombination which for a fully ionized plasma is roughly 10 times larger than @xmath79 ; free - streaming of photons at recombination further increase this scale ; for detailed discussions and implications of this for cmbr anisotropies see @xcite ) .",
    "a second simplification , closely related to the first but physically distinct , occurs because the width of visibility function at the last scattering surface corresponds to scales @xmath81 , and hence for studying physical processes at much larger scales the recombination can be treated as instantaneous ( for caveats see @xcite ) .",
    "out interest here is in scales that are super - horizon at the last scattering surface ( @xmath82 , comoving ) , corresponding to angular scales @xmath83 .",
    "therefore we will use tightly coupled approximation and not discuss the effects of photon diffusion . using these approximations , adiabatic initial conditions and also",
    "the fact that the ratio of baryon to photon energy density @xmath84 at the epoch of decoupling for acceptable models of primordial nucleosynthesis , the temperature and polarization anisotropies generated at the last scattering surface are : ( for details see @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath85 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "these large scale solutions show that : ( a ) temperature and polarization anisotropies are correlated with each other , ( b ) the amplitude of polarization anisotropies is suppressed by a factor @xmath89 ; e.g. for @xmath90 this factor is roughly @xmath91 .",
    "this suppression is owing to the fact that polarization anisotropies @xmath92 . in the strict tight coupling approximation ,",
    "only the temperature monopole and dipole are non - zero in the comoving frame .",
    "a small quadrupole is generated owing to free streaming of photons before they scatter for the last time ; and this quadrupole is suppressed with respect to the monopole and dipole , which constitute the primary sources of temperature anisotropies , by the factor @xmath93 . as we shall see below , in the reionized models",
    "this suppression is absent . in figure  4",
    "we show the cmbr temperature and polarization anisotropies , generated at the last scattering surface .    in the reionized models , a fraction cmbr photons scatter again after the epoch of reionization . as argued above",
    ", this fraction is small as many of the features of the primary anisotropies have already been detected .",
    "we have already discussed the effect of reionization on temperature anisotropies and argued that the reionization signal is very difficult to discern from temperature anisotropies alone . like temperature anisotropies ,",
    "one of the effects of reionization would be to wipe out polarization anisotropies generated at the last scattering surface for scales @xmath94 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tpeq ] ) , the generation of new polarization anisotropies will be proportional to the value of @xmath95 at the epoch of reionization .",
    "( [ eq : tpeq ] ) can simplified further by dropping terms of polarization monopole and quadrupole of polarization anisotropies in the rhs of the equation , as these terms are negligible compared to the temperature quadrupole ( see below ) .",
    "( [ eq : tpeq ] ) then give the following solution for the generation of polarization anisotropies following reionization : @xmath96 most of the contribution to the integral will come from close to the reionization epoch ( typically @xmath97 , the width of visibility function if it is approximated as a gaussian as above ) .",

    "this change can potentially be observed using the hyperfine transition of the hydrogen atom at @xmath109 .",

    "we take up the issue whether it is possible to explain the observed ionization structure of the universe within the framework of currently - favoured @xmath143 models of formation of structures . in these models , the observed structures in the universe grew from gravitational instability of density fluctuations which originated during inflationary epoch in the very early universe ( see .e.g @xcite , @xcite ) . the gravitational collapse of these structures might either set off star - formation ( alternatively some material might end up in black holes which by accreting more matter will radiate with harder spectrum than first star - forming galaxies , see e.g. @xcite ) which will emit uv light and ionize the igm .",
