    "the moderately high temperature superconductivity with @xmath4 , discovered about one year ago in mgb@xmath0 @xcite has stimulated an intense research activity all over the world .",
    "superconductivity in this binary compound appears to be due to an electron - phonon interaction and compatible with bcs @xmath2-wave superconductivity .",
    "thermodynamics and contact tunneling data as well as some theoretical studies indicate that superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 is one of the rare examples of two - band superconductivity with two energy gaps , attached to different sheets of the fermi surface @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the two gap model appears not to be able to cope with a strongly anisotropic upper critical field in @xmath5-axis oriented mgb@xmath0 films and more recently in single crystals of mgb@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the anisotropic @xmath2-wave model can describe in principle an anisotropy of the upper critical field and an angular dependence of @xmath3 including deviations from the ginzburg - landau prediction with anisotropic mass term @xcite .",
    "indeed , some of the stm data appear to be more consistent with an anisotropic @xmath2-wave model @xcite . however , more telling is the temperature dependence of the ratio of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 where the superfix @xmath9 and @xmath5 denotes a field oriented parallel to the @xmath9-axis or the @xmath5-axis , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath10 increases as temperature decreases as has been observed in refs .",
    "this clearly indicates that @xmath11 has to have oblate rather than the prolate form suggested earlier @xcite .",
    "otherwise @xmath12 would decrease with decreasing temperature .",
    "the object of this paper is to propose an oblate @xmath11 gap anisotropy and to see whether this order parameter can describe the two gap features observed experimentally .",
    "indeed choosing one adjustable parameter , which determines the ratio of @xmath13 , we can describe reasonably well the density of states measured by stm @xcite and the specific heat data of wang et al @xcite .",
    "also some peculiarities of the nmr relaxation rate and optical conductivity can be described .",
    "then we shall go on to study the upper critical field for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "as we shall see later , we can describe @xmath8 reasonably well by choosing our parameter @xmath16 ( corresponding to a ratio of @xmath17 , see below ) . on the other hand , the strong increase of @xmath6 appears to be somewhat difficult to fit consistently with other experimental data within our model .",
    "of course in the real single crystals the electronic mean free path is rather short @xmath18@xcite .",
    "therefore in a more realistic analysis it is necessary to consider impurity scattering as well .",
    "we consider an anisotropic bcs model for superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 with an order parameter given by @xmath19 where the parameter @xmath9 determines the anisotropy , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the polar angle with respect to the @xmath5-axis . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the anisotropic @xmath2-wave order parameter is plotted in momentum space for @xmath22 displaying a pancake - like shape .",
    "its maximum value @xmath23 lies in the @xmath24-plane , while in @xmath5-axis direction it assumes its minimum value of @xmath25 . in the following",
    "we will explore the consequences of anisotropic @xmath2-wave superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 within the framework of the weak - coupling bcs theory .",
    ".gap ratios and specific heat jumps for @xmath9= 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have solved numerically the weak - coupling gap equation for the state eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) @xmath26 here , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denotes an angular average over the variable @xmath29 . in table  [ t.1 ] we tabulated gap ratios found from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ gapeq ] ) for @xmath9= 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 . with increasing value of @xmath9 an increasing gap ratio of the maximum gap @xmath30 is found , while the minimum gap ratio appears to decrease .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the corresponding density of states for these values of @xmath9 calculated from @xmath31    the data in @xcite resembles our density of states if we choose @xmath32 .",
    "further the peak in the density of states in @xcite gives a maximum gap @xmath33  mev consistent with our model .",
    "also the authors @xcite deduced a momentum dependence of @xmath11 , which is topologically the same as the earlier model @xcite . on the other hand , the data in @xcite",
    "exhibits a two gap like structure very different from fig .",
    "further , the maximum gap @xmath34  mev is somewhat smaller then the one expected from the present model .",
    "however , the double gap like feature is inherent to the anisotropic gap , since the two extrema associated with the single gap are always visible @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the specific heat is shown for values of @xmath9= 10 , 20 , and 40 along with the data of wang et al . @xcite .",
    "the specific heat jumps found from our model are also tabulated in table  [ t.1 ] .",
    "they decrease with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "the closest agreement with the experimental data is obtained for @xmath35 . however , fitting of the structures seen in the experimental data would require some fine tuning of the angular dependence in eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the normalized nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate obtained from our state . with increasing anisotropy @xmath9 the hebel - slichter peak is reduced .",
    "roughly , the size of the peak found here is consistent with recent nmr data on polycrystalline mgb@xmath0 by kotegawa et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has recently been noted that the gap seen in optical conductivity appears to be very small @xcite .",
    "we calculated the anisotropic analog of the mattis - bardeen conductivity @xcite averaged over all directions , which should correspond to the response of a polycrystalline thin film sample as has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite . for our anisotropic state",
    "the conductivity @xmath36 is obtained using the following two functions : @xmath37 } } \\left [ \\tanh \\left ( \\frac{(x+y ) \\delta}{2 t } \\right ) - \\tanh \\left ( \\frac { y \\delta}{2 t } \\right ) \\right]\\ ] ] @xmath38 } } \\tanh \\left ( \\frac { y \\delta}{2 t } \\right)\\ ] ] using these the optical conductivity reads @xmath39 & 2 \\delta_{\\rm min } < \\omega < 2 \\delta_{\\rm max } \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\delta}{\\omega } \\left [ i_1 \\left ( \\frac{\\omega}{\\delta } \\right ) - i_2 \\left ( \\frac{\\omega}{\\delta } , 0 \\right ) \\right ] & \\omega > 2 \\delta_{\\rm max } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the result for @xmath35 and different reduced temperatures is shown in fig .",
    "indeed it appears that the optical conductivity is mainly dominated by the minimum gap within our model , because the absorption threshold starts at @xmath40 .",
    "thus , an anisotropic gap scenario can also account for the small gap seen in the optical conductivity .",
    "most useful would be optical conductivity studies on single crystals which could resolve the @xmath5-axis and @xmath24-plane response in order to see more clearly , what the anisotropy looks like .",
    "recent experiments on the upper critical field in mgb@xmath0 single crystals have reported a strong temperature dependent anisotropy of @xmath3 and an unusual upward curvature of the critical field parallel to the @xmath24 plane .",
    "an anisotropy of the superconducting pairing can in principle give such an effect .",
    "we investigate the temperature dependence of both @xmath3 , parallel and perpendicular to the crystal @xmath5-axis of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the general equation for the upper critical field is derived from the gap equation . for unconventional superconductors",
    "it can be treated variationally , some technical details can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "\\(a ) @xmath14    the equation for the upper critical field parallel to the @xmath5-axis is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the fermi velocity within the @xmath24-plane .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the numerical solution of this equation , normalized by its derivative at @xmath44 , @xmath45 , is plotted along with the @xmath46-curves for the @xmath24-direction , the corresponding curve for the isotropic case , and normalized experimental data by angst et al .",
    "@xcite . in the limit @xmath47 for @xmath22",
    "we have @xmath48 which is somewhat smaller than the corresponding value in the isotropic @xmath2-wave superconductor @xmath49 . in the vicinity of @xmath44",
    "the upper critical field exhibits naturally a rather linear temperature dependence within the weak - coupling bcs theory .",
    "this behavior is observed for both anisotropic @xmath2-wave and conventional superconductors .",
    "note , that our results for the upper critical field parallel to the @xmath5-axis for @xmath50 are in good correspondence with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the best fit to these data is obtained for @xmath51 .",
    "however , we can not reliably extract a value of @xmath9 from these data , because @xmath52 for @xmath53 is saturating at a value of 0.59054 and the data are already close to this limit .",
    "thus , also even higher values of @xmath9 might still be consistent with the @xmath5-axis data .",
    "\\(b ) @xmath54    the derivation of the equation for the temperature dependent upper critical field in the plane is more involved .",
    "the problem is that a mixing of higher landau levels takes place @xcite .",
    "we choose a variational wavefunction suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 36 ) , which corresponds to a distorted abrikosov ground state .",
    "due to the anisotropy of our state such a distortion is expected for the field direction perpendicular to the @xmath5-axis .",
    "the distortion can be varied using a parameter @xmath55 , which has to be determined by a variational principle . using this method we arrive at the following equation for the temperature dependence of the upper critical field @xmath56 @xmath57 here @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the fermi velocity in @xmath5-axis direction .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 has to be determined from a minimization of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqrhoa ] ) , taking its derivative to be zero .",
    "we have compared our results with a second , independent calculation based on a landau level expension up to the fourth landau level following the method of lukyanchuk and mineev @xcite . for the parameter range @xmath60 both methods were in close agreement with each other .",
    "however , for @xmath61 the landau level expansion started to give significantly smaller values for @xmath62 , indicating that inclusion of even higher landau levels becomes necessary , and showing that the distorted abrikosov wavefunction is a better variational solution in this case .",
    "the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqrhoa ] ) obtained from a numerical optimization of @xmath55 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in the zero - temperature limit",
    "we obtain @xmath63 for @xmath22 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "the curve for @xmath65 possesses a slight upward curvature in agreement with the experimental data . from our comparison with the experimental data @xcite we extracted the values @xmath66  t / k and @xmath67",
    "choosing @xmath22 , from these we deduce average fermi velocities @xmath68  cm / sec , @xmath69  cm / sec and the ratio @xmath70 .",
    "the last ratio is very consistent with what was obtained earlier @xcite using the data in @xcite .",
    "also the absolute values of these fermi velocities @xmath43 and @xmath59 are roughly consistent with bandstructure calculation results provided to us by a.  yaresko .",
    "this rather large value of @xmath65 appears to give a reasonable fit to the @xmath24-plane data of @xmath3 .",
    "but unfortunately , this corresponds to a ratio of @xmath71 , which appears to be inconsistent with the values we discussed above . here",
    "we can just speculate about a possible resolution of this problem : in these single crystals the mean free path is relatively short , being about the order of the coherence length @xcite , which puts these systems in an intermediate region between the clean and the dirty limit .",
    "therefore a study of the influence of impurity scattering would be necessary .",
    "it is possible that the upper critical field anisotropy is much less sensitive to impurity scattering than the energy gap and the density of states , for example .",
    "such an effect could possibly resolve this problem and is left for a future work .",
    "we have described a model of anisotropic s - wave superconductivity and compared our theoretical predictions with the experimental data of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we show that our model can capture many aspects of the two gap model and is consistent with the experimental data of single crystals mgb@xmath0 .",
    "also we stress that so far our model is the only one , that can describe the strongly temperature dependent anisotropy in the upper critical field . unfortunately , strongly different values of our anisotropy parameter @xmath9 had to be used for different experimental properties . on the other hand , we have ignored the effect of impurity scattering in the present analysis .",
    "in particular the mean free path @xmath72  reported for single crystals of mgb@xmath0 implies that we are in the intermediate regime ( neither in the clean limit nor in the dirty limit ) .",
    "therefore in a more realistic analysis , it will be very important to incorporate the effect of impurity scattering .",
    "clearly , we also need more precise measurements on single crystal mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we would like to thank m.  angst , f.  bouquet , and a.  junod for providing us with the digital form of their experimental data .",
    "thanks are also due to y.  takano , j.  karpinski , p.  thalmeier , a.  yaresko , and n.  schopohl for useful discussions related to this subject .",
