    "as hadrons are subjected to more detailed examination in electron scattering experiments , such as those proposed at cebaf , a quark - based description of their electromagnetic ( em ) interaction , which is applicable over a broad range of momenta , becomes desirable .",
    "local effective field theories based on hadronic degrees of freedom , although attractive for their efficiency , are subject to difficulties when conditions are sufficient to probe characteristics of subhadronic origin@xcite .",
    "an ideal perspective on this problem can be gained by sacrificing local interactions in favor of retaining some knowledge of the quark substructure content of the effective hadron fields@xcite , and is the spirit of the present investigation . in such a treatment ,",
    "the em interaction with a pion at tree level in the hadron fields is , for example , illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "there , the pion bethe - salpeter amplitudes , @xmath1 , reflect the ability of the internal degrees of freedom to share the transferred momentum , while the quark - photon vertex ( qpv ) , @xmath2 , contains information about the interaction with a dressed quark , including the production of @xmath0 vector - meson modes expected from vector - meson dominance or dispersion theory phenomenology . at larger momentum transfers where the effective scale provided by the vector - meson poles has been exceeded",
    ", the qpv also provides information about the approach of photon - hadron vertices to asymptotic behavior .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the qpv is therefore central to the em description of hadrons at intermediate momentum scales , and must address issues of confinement , dynamically generated @xmath0 vector bound states , and asymptotic freedom .",
    "in addition to its role in the em interaction , the qpv is a quantity of interest on its own merit .",
    "it is well known , for example , that a formal description of meson bound - state spectra and wavefunctions can be obtained by considering the interaction of a quark with an external field having the quantum numbers of the bound state of interest .",
    "in such a description , the external field excites a @xmath0 pair from the vacuum .",
    "their subsequent gluon - mediated interactions provide self - energy and vertex dressing .",
    "the existence of bound states is exhibited by poles in the dressed vertex . the position and residue of a given pole yield information about the bound - state mass and wavefunction respectively .",
    "vertex functions of quarks with external fields thus provide a unique environment in which to study the formation of meson bound states .",
    "the interaction with a photon is simply one example of this , and it is expected that the approach presented here can be applied to the description of bound states with other quantum numbers as well as vectors .    in this paper the qpv with gluon dressing at the ladder level of approximation is investigated in both the time - like and space - like region of photon momentum squared .",
    "particular attention is given to the formation of vector bound states and confinement phenomenology , however the primary goal of this initial investigation is to develop a description of the quark - photon interaction in the space - like region relevant to electron scattering which simultaneously addresses the role of vector mesons and quark substructure .",
    "the equations implied by the ladder approximation are@xmath3 the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation @xmath4 and the schwinger - dyson equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 , the quark green s function , @xmath7 , is defined from its inverse , and for convenience the model gluon two - point function is taken to be diagonal in lorentz indices ( @xmath8 ) . in eq.([ibs ] ) @xmath9 is the photon momentum , while @xmath10 is the average of the incoming and outgoing quark momenta .",
    "these expressions are illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the current - quark masses in this investigation are assumed to be zero , which allows an overall charge matrix to be omitted from eq.([ibs ] ) , but the approach can be easily extended to include nonzero masses .",
    "the absence of masses further implies that all dimensionful constants enter through the parameterization of the gluon two - point function , @xmath11 . here the infrared contribution to this quantity is characterized by an effective strength , @xmath12 , and an effective range , @xmath13 , in addition to the known ultraviolet form .",
    "the motivation for employing the ladder approximation is provided by the following arguments .",
    "first , it offers an em gauge - invariant description . both the ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) , @xmath14 and the ward identity ( wi )",
    ", @xmath15 are satisfied by this approximation .",
    "this is easily demonstrated by directly substituting ( [ wti ] ) or ( [ wi ] ) into ( [ ibs ] ) for the vertex , and employing ( [ sde ] ) .",
    "further , it has been shown recently how gauge invariance at the quark level in the ladder approximation to the qpv fits into a gauge - invariant description of composite mesons leading to wtis at the hadronic level@xcite .",
    "second , in the vicinity of a @xmath0 resonance , the vertex obtains the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the residue at the pole , and from ( [ ibs ] ) satisfies @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "this is the homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation for a vector @xmath0 bound state",
    ". one can conclude from ( [ wti ] ) and ( [ pole ] ) that the on - mass - shell solution of the homogeneous equation satisfies @xmath20 , provided the self - energy functions are nonsingular .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation at this level has been investigated previously , and acceptable results have been obtained for the lowest mass bound states@xcite .",
    "it is therefore anticipated that , in the addition to providing an em gauge invariant description of the quark - photon interaction for use in electron scattering , this level of approximation has the ability to describe the spectrum and structure of vector bound states .    finally , the schwinger - dyson equation ( [ sde ] ) has been extensively studied with regard to confinement phenomenology and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking@xcite . it has been demonstrated , for example , that for a suitably chosen gluon two - point function @xmath11 , quark green s functions which are free of singularities on the real @xmath21 axis are produced ; therefore denying the existence of a single - particle spectrum .",
    "it is shown here , however , that this is not a sufficient condition for the formation of finite - size @xmath0 states , but is an essential ingredient in a description of confinement based on an interaction between dressed quarks which does not rise to infinity at large distances .",
    "this alternate description of confinement in fact relies on the interaction between dressed quarks diminishing at separations beyond the characteristic length scale , @xmath13 , at which point the quark green s function approaches its vacuum value .",
    "the quarks are then repelled by the vacuum due to absence of a mass pole in the vacuum quark green s function .",
    "the effective  rising potential \" of traditional models of confinement occurs here as a result of the repulsive interaction of quarks with the vacuum in combination with the decreasing interaction between dressed quarks with increasing separation .",
    "such a description has proven successful in the formulation of a confining nontopological soliton model for baryons@xcite .",
    "this mechanism arises naturally here , and is pursued as a possible realization of confinement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "the general features of the qpv are given along with the reduction of eq.([ibs ] ) to a form suitable for computer applications .",
    "the solution of the homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( [ bs ] ) is also discussed there . in sec.3",
    "a discussion of confinement is presented in the context of a particular model which yields analytic solutions to both the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter and schwinger - dyson equations ( [ ibs ] ) and ( [ sde ] ) respectively . also discussed there is the criteria for the formation of finite - range bound states in the context of this model of confinement .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the qpv for both the time - like and space - like regions of the photon momentum squared is given in sec.4 .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in sec.5 .",
    "in this section , the steps required to reduce the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( [ ibs ] ) to a form suitable for computer applications are outlined .",
    "the approach is straightforward and is based on the general features of the qpv as described by ( [ ibs ] ) .",
    "where possible , lengthy algebraic manipulations are omitted . to begin , it is useful to write the self energy , @xmath22 from ( [ sde ] ) , in the form @xmath23 + b(p^2)\\label{2.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 p^2= g^2\\frac{8}{3}\\int \\frac{d^4k}{(2\\pi ) ^4}d(p - k)\\frac{a(k^2)p\\cdot k}{k^2a^2(k^2)+b^2(k^2)},\\label{2.2}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 the quark green s function , @xmath7 , and its inverse , @xmath26 , can then be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are defined in an obvious fashion from @xmath26 .    from eq.([ibs ] ) it is evident that the qpv , in addition to its lorentz four - vector structure , is a four - by - four matrix in dirac indices and is in general a function of two non - orthogonal four vectors , @xmath10 and @xmath9 ( @xmath30 ) . on first appraisal",
    ", one might therefore expect that the complete set of sixteen dirac matrices @xmath31 must be employed in its description .",
    "however , by limiting the gluon two - point function , @xmath11 , to diagonal components in lorentz indices , the tensor , @xmath32 , is excluded .",
    "this is seen explicitly by rewriting the integrand of ( [ ibs ] ) using @xmath33 _ { il}&=&\\left ( \\gamma _ { \\nu } \\right ) _ { ij}\\left [ g(k_+)\\gamma _ { \\mu } ( p , q)g(k_-)\\right ] _ { jk}\\left ( \\gamma _ { \\nu } \\right ) _ { kl}\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4}m^a_{il}\\mbox{tr}\\left [ m^ag(k_+)\\gamma _ { \\mu } ( p , q)g(k_-)\\right ] , \\label{2.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the set of matrices @xmath34 , from which @xmath32 is absent , are obtained through fierz reordering , and the repeated indices are summed .",
    "further , the pseudo - scalar matrix , @xmath35 , can be excluded by considering that the corresponding term in ( [ 2.5 ] ) has the form @xmath36 , where the matrix structure has been completely factored . in order to contribute to the qpv",
    ", this term must form a four vector , which requires @xmath37 to be an axial vector .",
    "it is immediately evident that this is impossible since there is an insufficient number of four vectors ( @xmath10 and @xmath9 ) to combine with the tensor @xmath38 to form an axial vector .",
    "the solution to ( [ ibs ] ) must therefore have the general form @xmath39 where the matrix structure is now explicit and the quantities @xmath40 are dimensionless functions with lorentz structure indicated by their indices .",
    "the constant @xmath12 has dimension of ( length)@xmath41 and is associated with the infrared strength of the gluon two - point function .",
    "the further reduction of the @xmath42 to a set of invariant functions is achieved through the use of the symmetry transformations of the vertex @xmath43 under @xmath35 ; charge conjugation , @xmath44 ; and parity , @xmath45 .",
    "the transformation properties are determined directly from the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( [ ibs ] ) and are given by @xmath46 where @xmath47diag@xmath48 and @xmath49 denotes a matrix transpose . from the general form given in ( [ 2.6 ] ) and the first two expressions in ( [ 2.7 ] ) , it is clear that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are even in both @xmath10 and @xmath9 , while @xmath52 is odd in @xmath10 and even in @xmath9 .",
    "the quantities @xmath42 can therefore be written as @xmath53 here the coefficients , @xmath54 , are functions of @xmath21 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the direction cosine between @xmath10 and @xmath9 , and @xmath58 is the vector transverse to @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the behavior of the coefficients for large space - like @xmath55 consistent with asymptotic freedom@xcite can be anticipated from ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "in particular , as @xmath61 the coefficients @xmath62 must tend to unity , while all others tend to zero . the separation in ( [ 2.8 ] ) into longitudinal and transverse contributions with respect to the index @xmath63",
    "allows three of the eight coefficient functions , @xmath54 , to be immediately determined from the wti ( [ wti ] ) in terms of the self - energy functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 given in ( [ 2.2 ] ) and ( [ 2.3 ] ) respectively .",

    "the five unknown transverse coefficients can be isolated using ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) , and the orthogonality of the dirac matrices .",
    "the closed set of equations so obtained can be written in matrix form as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70(@xmath71 and @xmath72 ) are matrices(vectors ) in the five - component space of the coefficient functions and @xmath73 is the direction cosine between @xmath74 and @xmath9 .",
    "the steps required to reach the result ( [ 2.16 ] ) along with the explicit forms of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are given in the appendix .",
    "the equation ( [ 2.16 ] ) contains the same information as the transverse component of the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( [ ibs ] ) ; to this point , no approximations have been made . to proceed",
    "further requires the specification of the gluon two - point function , @xmath11 .",
    "the solutions of the homogeneous bethe - salpeter equation , ( [ bs ] ) , describe the coupling of a @xmath0 vector bound state to a quark , and thereby provide information about the internal dynamics of the bound state .",
    "although these solutions can be obtained directly from the coefficient functions , @xmath75 of the previous section , their normalization is more readily achieved by considering the solution of the homogeneous equation . to this end ,",
    "the quantity @xmath76 is decomposed as @xmath77 the association of the coefficients @xmath78 with the coefficients @xmath42 of ( [ 2.6 ] ) is directly observed from the relationship between the solutions to the inhomogeneous and homogeneous bethe - salpeter equations given in ( [ pole ] ) .",

    "explored here is the notion that this effect may be in part due to the interaction of quarks ( or more generally colored objects ) with the vacuum . in particular , that confinement is manifest in the absence of a mass pole in the vacuum green s function of a colored object implies that the object is repelled by the vacuum , and hence attracted to other colored objects to form a color singlet by virtue of the interaction with the vacuum .",

    "the quarks are allowed to propagate throughout space .",
    "however , due to the energy stored in the mean field , the self - consistent ( minimum - energy ) solution acquires a finite range . in that case , as a quark in the system is separated from the others , the influence of the mean field on the quark diminishes and the mass rises as in ( [ 3.3 ] ) .",
    "the quarks are thus confined to the region of nonzero mean field by virtue of their interaction with the vacuum .",
    "the situation is similar for the qpv of interest here .",

    "the analytic solutions outside this region are not as simple , but can be represented graphically . as an example , the coefficient function @xmath112 is shown in fig.[fig4 ] for @xmath113 .",
    "the exhibited continuous spectrum arises from the fact that the gluon two - point function ( [ 3.1 ] ) provides a constant , or infinite - range , interaction between the quarks in coordinate space .",
    "the quarks are therefore allowed to propagate throughout space uninhibited by the presence of the vacuum .",
    "this situation is analogous to that of the constant mean - field case discussed previously .",
    "several observations can be made from this example .",
    "first , the absence of a mass pole in the vacuum green s function of a colored object is sufficient for a description of confinement provided the subsequent interactions with other colored objects contain a scale beyond which the interaction diminishes allowing the presence of the vacuum to become apparent . this defines a confinement scale that is largely responsible for the characteristics of bound states .",
    "the effect of such a scale is investigated in the numerical work to follow in sec.4 , however , one can anticipate that as the range of the interaction increases , the density of bound - state poles increases ; finally giving rise to a continuous spectrum as illustrated above .",
    "second , the identification of a true bound - state pole requires careful examination of the @xmath114 plane .",
    "finally , with regard to electron scattering , in general the singularity structure of the qpv in the time - like region of photon momentum squared dominates the behavior in the low momentum region of space - like @xmath55 .",
    "this feature is exhibited here despite the absence of a bound - state pole .",
    "the intercept at @xmath115 , is provided by the constraints , ( [ 2.10 ] ) , derived from the wi , which the coefficient functions given in ( [ 3.4 ] ) satisfy explicitly . further out in the space - like region a transition to asymptotic behavior is expected . as is illustrated in fig.3b , an unphysically sharp transition occurs here due to the nonanalytic structure of the self - energy amplitude , @xmath65 , in ( [ 3.2 ] ) . based on these observations ,",
    "the approximation ( [ 3.1 ] ) does not provide a useful description of bound states or the approach to asymptopia , but is of pedagogical value for investigating the behavior of the qpv for the situation where the confinement length scale , defined here as the quark separation at which the vacuum becomes apparent , is taken to infinity .",
    "the set of equations for the five transverse coefficient functions represented in ( [ 2.16 ] ) , and given explicitly in the appendix , forms the basis for the numerical investigation undertaken here .",
    "the approach used in evaluating these equations is to express each _ element _ of the matrices(vectors ) in the five - component space of coefficient functions as a _",

    "that is , for each value of @xmath55 a different set of equations is obtained . for the numerical evaluation , the momentum @xmath10 and the direction cosine @xmath116 are discretized in terms of gauss - quadrature points .",
    "the integrations are then carried out as matrix multiplication .",
    "the coupled equations are solved as a matrix equation in the expanded direct - product space of the coefficient functions and the gauss integration points .",
    "the dimension of the equation is given by 5@xmath117nppts@xmath117ncpts , where nppts and ncpts are the number of gauss points representing the @xmath10 and @xmath116 integrations respectively .",
    "the number of points in both integrations is varied to ensure accuracy .",
    "for the momentum , twenty to forty quadrature points are used , while six to ten are used for the direction cosine .",
    "the aim in this initial investigation is not necessarily to reproduce the known bound - state spectrum , but rather to correlate trends in the spectrum with changes in the parameterization of the infrared form of the gluon two - point function .",
    "the sensitivity of the spectrum to these changes then provides a constraint on the calculation of the qpv in the space - like region . to this end , a sufficient parametrization of the gluon two - point function is given by @xmath118 where the first term ( which has the coordinate space representation @xmath119 ) provides a length scale , @xmath13 , characterizing the infrared behavior while the second term models the known ultraviolet form .",
    "the parameter @xmath120 , which is associated with the qcd scale , is fixed at @xmath121 fm@xmath41 throughout this investigation . as @xmath13 approaches infinity the first term reduces to the delta - function model of eq.([3.1 ] ) .",
    "the gluon two - point function ( [ 4.1 ] ) has been employed previously in the study of bethe - salpeter and schwinger - dyson equations@xcite , and is expected to provide an acceptable accounting of the infrared effects for the purposes of the investigation conducted here .",

    "the solution of the schwinger - dyson equation in the complex plane is a challenging problem in itself@xcite , and is being pursued elsewhere for forms such as that in ( [ 4.1])@xcite . although these solutions are crucial to a comprehensive study of the present problem , reasonable approximations are available .",
    "the analytic solutions given in ( [ 3.2 ] ) for the self - energy functions obtained using the simple model two - point function ( [ 3.1 ] ) are useful in this regard .",
    "it is shown , for example , in ref.@xcite that the solutions to ( [ 2.2 ] ) and ( [ 2.3 ] ) for the self - energy amplitudes obtained using ( [ 4.1 ] ) , display behavior similar to the simple model solutions of ( [ 3.2 ] ) on the real axis with the exception of an additional tail on the scalar amplitude , @xmath65 , attributed to the ultraviolet contribution in ( [ 4.1 ] ) .",

    "this is in reasonable agreement with the observed @xmath132 mass , considering that pion dressing is expected to lower this value@xcite , yet the excitation spectrum does not coincide with experimentally observed quantities .",
    "comparison with the measured excitation spectrum can be improved by decreasing the range , @xmath13 , however this also leads to an increase in the ground - state mass , and away from the known value . as illustrated previously with the analytic solutions ( [ 3.4 ] ) , in the limit as @xmath13 approaches infinity",
    "a continuous spectrum is obtained . from this discussion , and the behavior displayed in fig.[fig5 ] , it is evident that the combination of the gluon two - point function ( [ 4.1 ] ) and the self - energy functions ( [ 4.2 ] ) , is not sufficient to reproduce the empirical excitation spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , it is encouraging that this approach affords the investigation of spectra beyond the ground state , which until recently@xcite has been the focus of bethe - salpeter phenomenology applied to mesons .",
    "the reproduction of spectra is clearly essential to constraining the interaction between quarks . in this regard ,",
    "the utility of the approach presented here is that , given a gluon two - point function and the associated solution to the schwinger - dyson equation , the vector bound - state spectrum can be obtained .",
    "the ability to reproduce the experimentally observed spectrum is then contingent upon the capacity of the ladder approximation to capture the relevant dynamics of qcd .",
    "the extraction of bound - state wavefunctions is achieved by considering the dependence of the coefficient functions , @xmath133 , on the momentum @xmath21 and the direction cosine @xmath116 in the vicinity of a pole . shown in fig.[fig6 ] are the solutions for the ground - state with mass @xmath131 mev , and with @xmath134 fm , as a function of @xmath21 for the two limiting values of the direction cosine , @xmath135 .",
    "the normalization is chosen such that the largest coefficient function is unity at @xmath105 .",
    "the relative strength of the other coefficients can then be observed .",
    "the absolute normalization is obtained through application of eq.([2.21 ] ) , but is not relevant to the present discussion .",
    "a rough estimate for the dependence of the solutions on the momentum and the direction cosine can be obtained by fitting the curves to an exponential of the form @xmath136 , which gives @xmath137 and @xmath138 fm@xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding estimate of the spatial extent is @xmath139 fm .",
    "the description of the qpv in the space - like region is largely independent of the spectrum in the time - like region with the exception of the ground state , which dominates the low momentum structure .",
    "the approach to asymptotic behavior at higher momentum is primarily determined by the asymptotic forms of the gluon two - point function and the self - energy functions .",
    "care has been taken here to accommodate both of these low and high momentum attributes in a manner that is consistent with their known features .",
    "the results of the calculation in the space - like region are summarized in figs.[fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .    in fig.[fig7 ] the solutions for the coefficient functions , @xmath140 ,",
    "are displayed versus the photon momentum , @xmath55 , for @xmath105 . a smooth transition from the low momentum region , dominated by the ground state vector - meson pole , to the high momentum approach to asymptopia is observed .",
    "it is therefore expected that the range of applicability of these solutions spans the entire range of momentum transfers available in electron scattering experiments . with the exception of @xmath112 , which approaches unity asymptotically ,",
    "the coefficient functions vanish for large momenta consistent with asymptotic freedom@xcite .",
    "the asymptotic form is apparent at @xmath141 @xmath142 ( @xmath143 gev@xmath144 ) , where the coefficient function @xmath112 achieves roughly twice the strength of the other coefficients .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that to a very good approximation the coefficients @xmath145 and @xmath146 are equal over the momentum range reported .",
    "shown in fig.[fig8 ] are the coefficient functions versus the momentum @xmath21 for @xmath147 @xmath142 , and for the limiting values of the direction cosine , @xmath135 .",
    "only a modest angular dependence is apparent , and again the coefficients @xmath145 and @xmath148 are approximately equal . the observed behavior in the space - like region can be roughly characterized in terms of the scales of the problem by the following analytic forms : @xmath149 ^{-1/2}\\ ; \\ ; \\ ; i\\neq 3\\nonumber \\\\",
    "^t_3&\\approx & 1+\\frac{1}{1+q^2/m^2_{\\rho } } \\left [ \\mbox{ln}\\left ( e+(p^2+q^2/4)/\\lambda ^2\\right ) \\right ] ^{-1/2},\\label{4.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath150 can be read from fig.[fig7 ] , and in present case the ground state vector mass is @xmath151 mev .",
    "the falloff with the momentum @xmath21 is reminiscent of the self - energy functions , while that with @xmath55 reflects the presence of the singularity in the time - like region .",
    "it should be understood that these forms are not the result of a detailed fit , but are rather offered as a guide to the qualitative behavior over the momentum range reported .",
    "the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation has been used to study several issues that arise in the nonperturbative description of the electromagnetic interaction with quarks .",
    "the investigation presented here represents a first solution of this equation in a gauge invariant formulation which features confinement and asymptotic freedom , in addition to the dynamical generation of @xmath0 vector meson modes .",
    "the principle results are summarized in figs.[fig5][fig8 ] .",
    "the solution in the time - like region warrants further study , particularly with regard to the reproduction of the excitation spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , the description presented here shows promise in the ability to study the vector meson spectrum beyond the ground state .",
    "further , the demonstrated sensitivity of the spectrum to the introduced infrared scale has positive implications for constraining the largely unknown behavior of the gluon two - point function at low momentum .",
    "the utility of this approach is , however contingent upon the ability of the ladder approximation to capture the relevant bound - state dynamics of qcd .",
    "the solution in the space - like region is potentially the most useful result of this investigation .",
    "the quark - based study of the em properties of hadrons relies heavily on the capacity to describe the quark - photon interaction .",
    "modeling this quantity based on gauge invariance provides only partial constraints on its behavior , and in particular allows for arbitrariness in the components transverse to the four momentum of the photon , which are those probed by electron scattering experiments .",
    "the use of vector meson dominance or the bare qpv , is limited by the momentum range for which these approximations are sensible . here",
    "a somewhat more fundamental approach has been taken by describing the quark - photon interaction through a model in which the dynamics dictate the role of @xmath0 vector bound states and the asymptotic behavior .",
    "the transverse contributions to the qpv are thus uniquely defined within the employed ladder approximation to the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation , and no restrictions on the momentum range are implied .",
    "the solutions obtained here are therefore expected to provide an essential ingredient in the quark - based description of the em interactions with hadrons .",
    "the essential steps required to reduce the inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation ( [ ibs ] ) to the matrix form given in ( [ 2.16 ] ) are listed below .",
