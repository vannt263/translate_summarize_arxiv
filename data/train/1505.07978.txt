    "heavy flavor physics has been a hot topic for many years in particle physics , since it is important for the study of cp violation and also a good place for searching of new physics signals . with more and more data from the lhcb experiment ,",
    "many hadronic b decay modes are well studied experimentally , but not the case for the theoretical side . among them",
    ", rare decays with flavor changing neutral currents are the most interesting , since they have a quite small branching ratios in the standard model , thus more sensitive to any new physics contributions .    in this work , we shall study the impact of a family non - universal leptophobic @xmath3 boson on @xmath8 decays dominated by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . in the standard model , the fcnc processes are suppressed since it is only induced by loop diagrams .",
    "the branching fractions of these decays are predicted at the order of @xmath2 @xcite , which is possible to be measured in the ongoing lhcb experiment or forthcoming belle - ii experiment . while the family non - universal @xmath3 boson leads to the tree - level flavor changing neutral currents , which may enhance the branching ratios of these decays .",
    "motivated by this , many fcnc processes induced by @xmath3 in flavor physics have been explored extensively in literatures @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "as the scalar meson @xmath9 is now unclear whether it belongs to the first excited states ( scenario 1 ) or the ground states ( scenario 2 ) @xcite , we have to discuss both cases in the current work .",
    "unlike the leptonic decays , the non - leptonic @xmath10 decays are complicated because many degrees of freedom and scales are involved .",
    "based on the effective field theories , there are three major qcd - inspired approaches for dealing with them , namely , the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite , and soft collinear effective theory @xcite . in this work , we shall employ the qcdf for evaluating the relevant hadronic matrix elements , as it is a systematic framework to calculate these matrix elements from qcd theory , which holds in the heavy quark limit @xmath11 .",
    "the recent discovery at the lhc @xcite of a light higgs with mass around 125 gev opened a new window to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in some new physics ( np ) models",
    "@xcite , when the initial group breaks down to @xmath12 of sm , an extra group @xmath13 will usually be produced , which leads to an additional massive neutral gauge boson called @xmath3 .",
    "if such a gauge boson were observed , it would be a concrete evidence of the existence of np .",
    "based on the assumption that the @xmath3 shares similar characters with @xmath14 boson of sm , many efforts have been made to search for @xmath3 directly by analyzing the data of dilepton .",
    "now , at the lhc , the lower mass limit is @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) at the @xmath17 confidence level at @xmath18 colliding energy with an integrated luminosity of @xmath19 by using @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite ( or @xmath22 @xcite ) events .",
    "however , such constraints from lhc are invalid if the @xmath3 boson does not couple or couples very weakly with the leptons , thus one has to resort to hadronic channels .",
    "although the couplings between quarks and @xmath3 are family universal in most models , the family non - universal @xmath3 can also be realized in some models .",
    "for instance , such a family non - universal leptophobic @xmath3 boson can be realized in @xmath23 model @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological studies of family non - universal @xmath3 on possible colliders have been explored in detail recently @xcite .    on the gauge interaction basis ,",
    "the interactions of the leptophobic @xmath3 boson with sm quarks can be expressed as @xmath24 \\psi^i_j , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the field @xmath25 is the @xmath26th family fermion and @xmath27 is the chirality projection operators .",
    "@xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) stand for the left - handed ( right - handed ) chiral couplings , and they are required to be hermitian because the lagrangian is real . when the weak eigenstates being rotated to the physical basis , the mass eigenstates will be obtained by @xmath30 .",
    "correspondingly , the coupling matrices of down - type quarks read @xmath31 since we do not need the couplings for up - type quarks , we will not discuss them here .",
    "obviously , if the matrixes @xmath32 are not proportional to the identity matrix , the nonzero off - diagonal elements in the @xmath33 appear , which will induce the fcnc interactions at the tree level . for simplicity ,",
    "the right - handed couplings are often supposed to be flavor - diagonal . then , the effective hamiltonian of the @xmath34 transitions mediated by the @xmath3 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes the mass of @xmath3 boson .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath38 are real due to the hermiticity of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast , the off - diagonal element @xmath39 might be a complex number with a new weak phase @xmath40 , and such a newly introduced phase can be used in explaining the large direct @xmath6 asymmetries in @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "compared with the effective hamiltonian of sm @xcite , the operators of the forms @xmath42 and @xmath43 in eq.([eqn : heff1 ] ) have already existed in sm , so the @xmath3 effect can be represented by modifying the wilson coefficients of the corresponding operators .",
    "thus , the eq.([eqn : heff1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the four quark operators existing in sm@xcite .",
    "the additional contributions to the sm wilson coefficients at the @xmath46 scale in terms of @xmath3 parameters are thus given as @xmath47 from above equations , we find that both the electro - weak penguins @xmath48 and the qcd penguins @xmath49 will be affected by the new gauge boson @xmath3 . since the scale of new physics is expected to be much higher than that of electroweak scale , in order to show that the new physics is primarily manifest in the electroweak penguins , we therefore follow ref.@xcite to assume @xmath50 . in this case , the @xmath3 contributions to the wilson coefficients are @xmath51 where @xmath52 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , we obtain the resulting effective hamiltonian at the @xmath46 scale @xmath53 because all heavy degrees of freedom ( including the @xmath3 ) above the scale of @xmath54 boson mass have been integrated out already and there is no new particles below @xmath55 , the renormalization group evolution of above new wilson coefficients down to low energies is exactly the same as in the sm @xcite .",
    "now , we will discuss the the ranges of new parameters @xmath56 and @xmath40 .",
    "because both the gauge group @xmath57 and the new @xmath13 are expected to origininate from the same large group , the relation @xmath58 is assumed . in the experimental side , if the leptophobic @xmath3 boson is detected at lhc , the mass of @xmath3 should be about a few tev , which means @xmath59 is at the order of @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , the other parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 and new weak phases @xmath40 could be constrained by the data induced by fcnc .",
    "for instance , the mass difference @xmath63 and @xmath64 requires @xmath65 .",
    "then , with experimental data of @xmath66 nonleptonic charmless decays , @xmath67 could be extracted . as for the new introduced phase @xmath40 , recent discussions indicate that @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "how to constrain these parameters globally is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we will not discuss this topic explicitly here .",
    "so , to probe the new physics effect for maximum range , we assume @xmath69 $ ] , and @xmath70 $ ] , and set @xmath71 and @xmath68 for the center values .",
    "in the @xmath72 decays , none of the quarks in final states is the same as those of the initial @xmath10 meson . therefore they can occur only via annihilation type diagrams .",
    "however , in qcdf , the end - point singularity usually appears when calculating the annihilation type diagrams @xcite . as a most popular way , the end - point divergent integral",
    "is treated as infrared sensitive contribution that is parameterized by @xmath73 where the unknown parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 could be fixed by the experimental data .",
    "this singularity can also be smeared by introducing the effective mass to gluon @xcite .",
    "we will adopt eq.([treat - for - anni ] ) in this work .    within the framework of qcdf",
    ", the decay amplitudes of @xmath72 can be written as    @xmath76 \\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath77 \\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath78 \\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath79 \\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    2 where the building blocks @xmath80 and @xmath81 read @xmath82 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b_4&=&{c_f\\over   n_c^2}\\left[c_4^\\prime a_1^i+c_6^\\prime a_2^f\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\   b_{\\rm 3,ew } & = & { c_f\\over   n_c^2}\\left[c_9^\\prime a_1^{i}+c_7^\\prime ( a_3^{i}+a_3^{f})+n_cc_8^\\prime a_3^{i}\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "when listing the two final state mesons @xmath88 in the formulas , we refer the first meson @xmath89 to containing an anti - quark from the weak vertex and refer @xmath90 to containing a quark from the weak vertex . as for the aforementioned endpoint singularity @xmath91 , we adopt the eq.([treat - for - anni ] ) with @xmath92 .",
    "note that the recent global fit of @xmath74 and @xmath75 to @xmath93 implies @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath97 $ ] and @xmath98 $ ] in estimating the uncertainties .    because both @xmath99 and @xmath100 could decay to @xmath101 and @xmath102 , we then define four decay amplitudes , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 as @xmath107 then , the direct @xmath6 asymmetry is defined as @xmath108    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     2    in order to show the effects of @xmath3 clearly , we also plot the variations of the branching ratios as functions of the new weak phase @xmath40 with different @xmath109 under different scenarios in fig.[fig : br ] . including the newly introduced @xmath3 boson",
    ", one can see that if @xmath110 the effects of @xmath3 are not large enough to be detected in these four decay modes , because the new physics contributions are buried by the large uncertainties of hadronic parameters .",
    "if @xmath111 is around 0.2 , the branching fraction of @xmath7 under s1 will be changed remarkably to reach to @xmath112 , which could be measured in the forthcoming belle - ii experiment .",
    "the relations of the direct @xmath6 asymmetries @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath40 with different @xmath111 are also presented in fig.[fig : cpsp ] and fig.[fig : cpsv ] , for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively . from fig.[table : cp ] , the observables of @xmath6 asymmetries are much sensitive to the @xmath3 than the branching fractions . for example",
    ", under s1 , the direct asymmetry of @xmath120 is @xmath121 in sm , while it would change to @xmath122 with @xmath3 boson . in future",
    ", these observables could be used to probe the effect of new physics .",
    "if the @xmath3 were detected in the colliders directly , these decays would also be useful to constrain the couplings .",
    "within the qcd factorization approach , we have studied the pure annihilation type decays @xmath1 in sm and the family non - universal leptophobic @xmath3 model .",
    "both the branching fractions and the @xmath6 asymmetry observables have been calculated .",
    "the branching fractions we predicted are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the results from pqcd approach . when the @xmath3 involved , if @xmath123 ( @xmath110 ) , its contributions will be buried by the large uncertainties of sm . if @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , both the branching fractions and @xmath6 asymmetries of @xmath7 could be changed remarkably , which provides us a place for probing the effect of new physics .",
