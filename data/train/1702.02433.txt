    "in presence of massive objects , the geometry of spacetime is warped .",
    "this warping , commonly called the curvature of spacetime , causes clocks situated at different locations to tick at different rates .",
    "this is known as gravitational time dilation and has been an experimentally proven phenomenon for about half of a century @xcite .",
    "even the relatively weak gravitational field of the earth has an effect on certain technological applications such as the global positioning system and must be accounted for .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have been able to detect time dilation near earth s surface due to height difference of 1 meter .",
    "recently , pikovski et al . have considered for the first time the effect of gravitational time dilation on the coherence of a composite quantum system prepared in a quantum superposition of two locations corresponding to different distances from earth @xcite . for this system ,",
    "e.g. , a molecule , time dilation induces a universal coupling between the internal degrees of freedom and the center of mass ( c.m . ) .",
    "this leads to decoherence in the c.m .",

    ", the internal degrees of freedom of the molecule play the role of the environment while the c.m .",
    "degree of freedom represents an open system . for",
    "the sake of concreteness , let us consider the case in which the internal degrees of freedom are bosonic .",
    "a standard example is a molecule for which the vibrations of its constituent atoms are described in terms of @xmath1 normal modes represented mathematically as uncoupled quantum harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the coupling between system and environment arises because the vibrational frequencies become position - dependent due to time dilation , namely , @xmath4 .",
    "this in turn induces non - dissipative decoherence , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . the gravitation - induced decoherence model considered by pikovski et al",
    ". relies on a number of quite restrictive approximations and should therefore be considered as a toy model useful to grasp the main features of a new decoherence mechanism .",
    "more specifically , the spherically symmetric metric is considered in the newtonian limit , valid only for slowly moving particles in weak gravitational fields , therefore general relativistic effects are not taken into account .",
    "secondly , a superposition of position eigenstates is considered as initial state , rather than a more physically significant superposition of macroscopically distinguishable classical - like states .",
    "thirdly , the observer , i.e. , the location of the decoherence measurement device , is assumed to be asymptotically far away .",
    "these assumptions may severely limit the generality of the conclusions made in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is therefore crucial to extend the proposed model towards more realistic physical scenarios . in this paper",
    "we generalize the study of gravitationally induced decoherence in several directions .",
    "first of all we calculate the deviations due to a non - asymptotic observer , as well as the effect of the total time dilation , in addition to the relative one . then we focus on the case in which the molecule is confined in a harmonic trap and initially prepared in a superposition of two macroscopically distinguishable coherent states of the c.m .",
    "motion , centered at two different heights .",
    "this allows us to describe gravitation - induced decoherence when the model open system is a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "this is particularly useful in describing the quantum to classical transition and , in fact , experiments revealing the decoherence of these so called cat states in this framework have been performed in different experimental platforms @xcite .",
    "importantly , the nonclassicality of this schrdinger cat state can be described by means of various , physically meaningful nonclassicality indicators , i.e. , the peak of the interference fringe of the wigner function @xcite , the nonclassical depth @xcite , the negativity of the wigner function @xcite , the vogel criterion @xcite and the klyshko @xcite criterion .",
    "such quantities measure different , nonequivalent ways in which our system can be nonclassical .",
    "therefore , a much more complete picture of the quantum to classical transition can be given by looking at the dynamics of all such indicators , since in general their characteristic decoherence timescales will be different .",
    "this is one of the main goals of this paper . finally , we take into account realistic sources of noise arising in the experiments .",
    "we compare the characteristic timescales of time dilation induced decoherence to the timescale of decoherence due to classical fluctuation in crucial experimental parameters .",
    "this allows us to assess whether time dilation induced decoherence is an observable phenomenon or , alternatively , to define the necessary measurement precision for the detection of such an intriguing fundamental effect .",

    "<S> we show that the experimental observation of decoherence due to time dilation imposes severe limitations on the allowed levels of classical noise in the experiments . </S>"
