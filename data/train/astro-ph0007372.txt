    "in the standard scenario of a core collapse explosion of a massive star , the bulk of the stellar envelope is ejected outward at a high velocity , shocking the surrounding medium , and forming a shell of diffuse emission , which is ultimately observed as a supernova remnant ( snr ) shell .",
    "the central core collapses to form a neutron star , which may be subsequently observed as a pulsar .",
    "snrs are classified according to their morphology as shells , plerions , or composites .",
    "while the shells have a shell - like structure , and represent the majority of snrs ( e.g. the cygnus loop ) , the plerions show a centrally bright morphology in radio and x - rays ( like the crab ) , with no evidence of emission from a shell .",
    "the composites have both a shell plus a centrally bright component .",
    "the x - ray emission from the shell is in most cases thermal , and results from the shocked swept - up interstellar medium ( ism ) , with a probable contribution from reverse  shocked ejecta in young remnants .",
    "the central x - ray emission in the plerionic composites is non - thermal , and results from synchrotron radiation from highly relativistic particles injected by the pulsar . as the pulsar wind encounters the surroundings , it gets shocked and forms the synchrotron nebula , seen as a plerion .    in the thermal composites ,",
    "the central emission is thermal , and arises mostly from thermal emission from the swept up ism .",
    "rho & petre ( 1998 ) refer to this class as ` mixed morphology ' snrs , to distinguish them from the plerionic composites .",
    "3c  397 ( g41.1 - 0.3 ) is one of the brightest galactic radio snrs , and its classification remains ambiguous . in the radio , it is classified as a shell - type snr , based on its steep spectral index @xmath8 = 0.48 and shell - like morphology . at 1 ghz , it has a flux density of 22 jy ( green 1998 ) , ranking the 5th brightest among @xmath0 100 remnants .",
    "the distance to g41.1 - 0.3 has been estimated as greater than 6.4 kpc on the basis of neutral hydrogen absorption measurements ( caswell  1975 ) .",
    "no absorption is seen at negative velocities , locating the remnant closer than 12.8 kpc .",
    "an hii region lying @xmath0 7  west of the snr is likely a foreground object , and was located between 3.6 kpc and 9.3 kpc ( cerosimo & magnani 1990 ) . at a distance of 10 kpc ,",
    "the linear size of the radio shell would be 7 @xmath6 13 pc@xmath9 .",
    "high - resolution radio imaging of g41.1 - 0.3 ( becker , markert , & donahue 1985 ; anderson & rudnick 1993 ) indicates that the remnant brightens towards the galactic plane , and is highly asymmetric .",
    "it has the appearance of a shell edge - brightened in parts , and lacks the symmetry seen in the young historical snrs , such as cas  a and tycho .",
    "3c  397 is slightly polarized with an overall polarized fraction of only 1.5% .",
    "kassim ( 1989 ) derives an integrated spectral index @xmath8 = 0.4 , with a turnover at a frequency less than 100 mhz .",
    "the discrepancy between the spectral indices derived by kassim and green is most likely due to uncertainties in measuring the total flux density of 3c  397 at centimeter wavelengths , and is attributed to confusion with the nearby hii region and the galactic background .",
    "anderson & rudnick ( 1993 ) investigate the variations of the spectral index across the remnant , and find variations of the order of @xmath10@xmath8 @xmath0 0.2 ( @xmath8 @xmath0 0.50.7 ) . the variations do not coincide with variations in the total intensity .",
    "they suggest that interactions between the expanding snr and inhomogeneities in the surrounding medium play a major role in determining the spatial variations of the index across the remnant .",
    "dyer & reynolds ( hereafter dr  99 ) , while finding a similar magnitude of spectral index variations , did not confirm anderson & rudnick s detailed spatial results , suggesting that the variations are due to image reconstruction problems or other difficulties .",
    "3c  397 has no optical counterpart , and is not observed in the uv probably because it lies in the galactic plane",
    ". an iras survey of galactic snrs ( saken , fesen & shull 1992 ) did not yield a positive identification of the snr in the far infrared .    in x - rays ,",
    "3c  397 was first detected with the  imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) and high - resolution imager ( hri ) , showing two central regions of enhancement ( becker  1985 ) , neither of which correlates with any bright radio feature .",
    "the ipc data imply for a thermal model an electron temperature @xmath11 @xmath12 0.25 kev and n@xmath13 @xmath14 5 @xmath6 10@xmath15 @xmath16 , implying an optical extinction , @xmath17 @xmath14 22.5 ( gorenstein 1975 ) .",
    "the quality of the data was however poor , and clearly other models were not ruled out .",
    "observations of 3c  397 with the pspc ( rho 1995 , rho & petre 1998 , dr  99 ) reveal 25 @xmath6 45 diffuse emission , with central emission and an enhancement along the western edge .",
    "spectrally , thermal models are favored over non - thermal models , which yield a very steep power law index ( rho 1995 ) .",
    "the spectrum is generally described by a thermal plama with @xmath11 @xmath0 1.7 kev .",
    "however the fit is poor , probably due to a combination of abundance effects , nonequilibrium ionization , and the unrealistic assumption of a single temperature .",
    "3c  397 has similar characteristics to the ` mixed - morphology ' snrs , in that it has a centrally bright x - ray morphology characterized by a thermal x - ray spectrum ; however , the quality of the  data and the narrow bandpass of  does not allow for an accurate determination of its x - ray emission mechanism .",
    "this left its classification as a ` mixed - morphology ' candidate highly uncertain ( rho & petre 1998 ) .",
    "combined  hri and high resolution radio images of 3c  397 ( dr  99 ) reveal a more complicated morphology .",
    "the snr appears brightest along the western edge of the shell , in both the radio and x - ray images .",
    "moreover , a bright spot was found with the  hri , at the center of the snr shell , but not correlated with any radio enhancement ( figure 12 in dr  99 ) .",
    "no pulsations are found to be associated with the x - ray hot spot .    in this paper",
    ", we present a broadband x - ray study of 3c  397 with the ,  and  satellites . while  has the highest spatial resolution ,  has the advantage over  in its broad bandpass and higher spectral resolution , which allowed us to detect strong emission lines typical of those seen in the spectra of young snrs .",
    "complements the other observations with its higher energy coverage which allow us to to search for a hard non - thermal component .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the  gis data was performed by keohane ( 1998 ) and reynolds & keohane ( 1999 ) , in order to obtain an upper limit on a possible nonthermal component resulting from the extension of the radio spectrum including an exponential cutoff in the electron distribution .",
    "the authors found that the radio spectrum had to begin rolling off around @xmath18 hz in order to avoid exceeding the continuum around 1 kev .",
    "though they did not perform extensive self - consistent spectral fitting , they found that a very hard component was also necessary to explain the continuum beyond a few kev .",
    "the time resolution of  ( @xmath0 1 @xmath19s ) allowed us to search for pulsations down to the millisecond range .",
    "the analysis of the data was however complicated by the contamination of the source spectrum with the emission from the galactic ridge .",
    "the  data have allowed us to : 1 ) confirm the presence of the hard component required to fit the  data and better constrain its parameters ; 2 ) find evidence of a third weak component , whose parameters were poorly determined due to the contamination by galactic ridge ; and 3 ) set an upper limit on the flux from a possibly hidden compact source .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 summarizes the observations . in sections 3 & 4",
    ", we present the spatial and spectral results with  and . in section 5",
    ", we present the results . in section 6 ,",
    "we summarize the results from the timing analysis .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section 7 .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "3c  397 was observed using  ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) on 1995 july 4 .",
    "we extracted the data from the heasarc public database , and present the observations acquired with the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) , and the solid state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) .",
    "the detectors are sensitive to x - rays in the 0.410 kev range , with a spectral resolution at 6  kev of 2% for the sis and 8% for the gis ( @xmath0@xmath20 ) .",
    "the point spread function of the gis alone is a gaussian with a full width at half max ( fwhm ) of 30  ( at 6 kev , @xmath0@xmath20 ) .",
    "the intrinsic spatial broadening of the sis detectors is negligible compared to that of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) .",
    "therefore the spatial resolution of the detectors is limited by the point spread function of the x - ray telescope , which has a relatively sharp core ( fwhm of 50 ) , but broad wings ( 50% encircled radius of 15 ) .",
    "the data were screened using the standard process .",
    "the pointing is at @xmath8 = 19@xmath21 07@xmath22 4320 , @xmath10 = 07  13  59 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the observations were performed using the standard time resolution : 0.5s for medium bit rate , and 62.5 millisecond for the high - bit rate .",
    "the sis data were acquired in 1-ccd mode , and read out every 4s .",
    "for the timing analysis , we use the gis high - bit rate data . for the spectral analysis",
    ", we use both the sis and gis data in high - bit rate mode .",
    "we note that chen  ( 1999 ) have reported the analysis of the same  sis data . in their paper",
    ", the authors use a blank sky field for background subtraction . in our paper",
    ", we subtract the background from the same field .",
    "this method is more appropriate since 3c  397 lies in the galactic ridge , and removing any contamination from the ridge is necessary before drawing any conclusion on the source spectrum .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the sis , we analyze the gis data which are more appropriate than the sis for studying the hard component .      in order to better understand the origin of the x - ray emission , we compare the  images with the high - spatial resolution images obtained with , sensitive in the @xmath0 0.12.0 kev energy range .",
    "3c  397 was observed with the high - resolution imager ( hri ) on several occasions in 1994 , and with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on 1992 october 28 for @xmath0 4 ksec .",
    "the  data have been analysed and presented elsewhere ( rho 1995 , dr  99 ) . to generate the  images , we extracted the data from the heasarc public database . for the hri",
    ", we used the longest exposure ( 52.3 ksec ) , performed on 1994 october 14 .",
    "the  pointing is at @xmath8 = 19@xmath21 07@xmath22 3360 , @xmath10 = + 07  08  24  ( j2000 ) .",
    "3c  397 was observed on six occasions between 1997 december 3 , and 1997 december 8 for an effective exposure of 58.4 ks .",
    "the 1  fwhm field of view ( fov ) of  is pointed at @xmath8 = 19@xmath21 07@xmath22 3499 , @xmath10 = 07  07  149 ( j2000 ) . the proportional counter array ( pca ) , consists of 5 collimated xenon proportional counter detectors with a total area of 6,500 cm@xmath9 , an effective energy range of 260 kev , and an energy resolution of 18% at 6 kev ( jahoda  1996 ) .",
    "the  ( gruber  1996 ) instrument consists of two clusters of collimated nai / csi phoswich detectors with an effective area of @xmath0 800 cm@xmath9 and an effective energy range of 15250 kev .    in this paper , we report the observations with the pca .",
    "the  count rates are background dominated , and were not included . for the spectral analysis , we use the data in the standard-2 mode , which provide spectral information . for the timing analysis",
    ", we use the good xenon modes which provide the highest time resolution ( @xmath01 @xmath19s ) .",
    "the  pointing is @xmath0 5  offset from the central `` hot spot '' detected with the  hri .",
    "we generate images of 3c  397 corrected for exposure and vignetting .",
    "we use the routine , @xmath24 , which calculates the net exposure time per sky pixel ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/abc/ ) . the total time seen by each sky pixel on the detector",
    "is computed using an instrument map ( generated with @xmath25 ) and the reconstructed aspect .",
    "the output exposure map is subsequently used to normalize the sky image . in figure 1",
    ", we show the generated images in the soft ( 0.54.0 kev ) and hard ( 410 kev ) energy bands of the gis .",
    "the effective exposure is 50.7 ksec ( both gis detectors ) , and the images are smoothed with a gaussian with @xmath26 = 45 . at the harder energies , the emission shows an elongation nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane . in figure 2",
    ", we compare the  hri image ( left panel ) and the hard band gis image ( right panel ) .",
    "the brightest features in the image , seen at @xmath0 12  east and west of the central hot spot , correlate with enhancements in the radio shell ( dr  99 ) .",
    "it is clear that these small scale features seen with the hri can not be resolved by the gis .",
    "however , the overall morphology of the gis image shows an elongation along the axis joining the hot spot with the bright radio edges .",
    "the hard emission peaks at the western lobe , and is not centrally peaked at the hri hot spot ( denoted by a cross ) , as would be expected from a plerionic composite . in figure 3 , we overlay contours from the sis hard band on the  pspc image .",
    "the sis contours are correlated with the pspc intensity map , and again suggest that the hard emission peaks at the western lobe , with some fainter emission associated with the central spot and the eastern lobe . while the gis is more sensitive than the sis to the hard x - ray band ( @xmath27 @xmath14 4 kev )",
    ", the sis has a higher efficiency at the softer energies .",
    "we subsequently examine the softness ratio , defined as @xmath28 , with the sis . in figure 4 , we show the resulting image ( left panel ) , with the total soft band ( 0.54 kev ) image obtained with the sis ( right panel ) .",
    "the hri contours are overlayed on both images , to show that there is an enhancement of soft emission from the central region .",
    "to study the x - ray spectrum , we have extracted events from a circular region of radius @xmath0  7  from the gis field , encompassing the entire snr . for the sis which has a smaller fov than the gis ,",
    "3c  397 fills a large fraction of the chip , and extends to the edges of the ccd along the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "we have extracted the source events from a circular region of radius @xmath0  4.2  to avoid the ccd chip boundaries . since",
    "3c  397 lies @xmath0 0.3@xmath29 below the galactic plane , and only 41  in longitude from the galactic center , the source spectrum is expected to be contaminated by emission from the galactic ridge .",
    "the large fov of the gis allowed us to extract a background spectrum from the same field .",
    "for the sis , it was also possible to extract a background ( of radius @xmath12 1 ) from the same chip , since 3c  397 does not fill the fov along the direction parallel to the galactic pane .",
    "this method of background subtraction has the advantage of providing the most accurate model of any spatial or temporal contamination which would affect the spectral analysis . while the extracted sis spectrum contains most of the emission from the snr , it is possible that we are missing part of the source flux .",
    "this was taken into account by introducing a relative normalization between the sis and the gis spectra . throughout the paper",
    ", we perform the flux estimates from the different components of the snr using the gis . the background subtracted count rates in the 0.69 kev energy range are 0.524 @xmath30 0.005 and 0.613 @xmath30 0.005 from gis2 and gis3 respectively .",
    "the corresponding sis0 and sis1 count rates are 0.768 @xmath30 0.007 and 0.580 @xmath30 0.007 respectively .    in the following , we present our spectral results for both the sis and gis data .",
    "we fit the sis data in the 0.69 kev range , and the gis over the 0.89 kev band .",
    "we disregard energies above 9 kev due to the poor signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we combine the sis and gis data to show a joint fit , to which we subsequently add the  pca data .",
    "the sis and gis spectra are clearly dominated by emission lines , with strong emission from mg , si , s , and ar ; the most prominent feature is the fe - k line .",
    "we have first attempted to fit the spectra with raymond - smith ( rs , raymond & smith 1977 ) and ( mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord 1985 ; liedahl  1990 ) models , which are appropriate for modeling plasma in collisional equilibrium ionization . a single - component collisional equilibrium ionization model with solar abundances",
    "does not yield an acceptable fit ( reduced chi - squared @xmath31 = 6.7 , @xmath32 = 735 , @xmath32 being the number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we subsequently used sedov models ( hamilton , sarazin , & chevalier 1983 , hereafter hsc 1983 , borkowski , in preparation ) which follow the time - dependent ionization of the plasma in a supernova remnant evolving according to sedov self - similar dynamics .",
    "these models are especially important for describing the emission from snrs whose age is smaller than the time required to reach ionization equilibrium .",
    "they are a subclass of non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) models , and include the range of temperatures found in a sedov remnant .",
    "they can therefore account for the hotter x - ray emission expected to originate from the inner parts of such snrs .",
    "the modifications introduced by borkowski  ( in preparation ) include improved atomic data ( in particular , fe l - shell line data are based on theoretical calculations by liedahl , osterheld , &  goldstein 1995 ) and the possibility of describing plasmas without electron - ion equipartition , including an incomplete heating of electrons at a blast wave .",
    "the models are characterized by three parameters : the shock temperature @xmath33 , the post - shock electron temperature @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 = @xmath37 , which characterizes the rate at which the plasma relaxes to ionization equilibrium ( @xmath2 is the hydrogen number density in the unshocked ambient medium , and @xmath27 is the explosion energy ) .",
    "an equivalent parameter to @xmath36 is the ionization time - scale @xmath1 = 1.24 @xmath6 10@xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 ( @xmath5 s ) , where @xmath41 is @xmath36 in units of 10@xmath42 erg @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the shock temperature in units of 10@xmath45",
    "k. we find that the sedov model provides a better fit , but only accounts for the x - ray emission up to about 4 kev .",
    "even a sedov fit with non - equipartition ( @xmath34 @xmath46 @xmath47 ; where @xmath34 and @xmath47 represent the electron and ion temperatures respectively ) does not provide a satisfactory fit to the hard component . in figure 5",
    ", we show the single - component sedov fit , characterized by an interstellar absorption @xmath48 = 2.75 @xmath6 10@xmath15 @xmath5 , a temperature @xmath49 = 0.15 kev , and an ionization parameter of @xmath50 = 1.86 @xmath6 10@xmath4 s @xmath5 ( @xmath51 = 2.89 , @xmath32 = 734 ) .",
    "varying the metal abundances within the or the sedov models improves the fits .",
    "however , the models still do not account for the hard x - ray emission ( above 4 kev ) , and the fits are unacceptable ( @xmath51 @xmath14 2.6 ) .",
    "while the single - component models account for the x - ray emission at energies below about 4 kev , they fail to fit the higher energy component ( figure 5 ) .",
    "this result was also found by chen ( 1999 ) .",
    "we note that even though the sedov model does include higher - temperature gas from the remnant interior , this model does not account for the hard component .",
    "in particular , the most prominent emission line near 6.55 kev is not accounted for , indicating that the fe - k line region can not be explained by the same component responsible for the fe - l emission , and must be characterized by different ionization parameter values .",
    "this result was also found in the young ejecta - dominated snrs such as tycho ( hwang , hughes , & petre 1998 ) , cas  a ( borkowski  1996 ) and kepler ( tsunemi , kinugasa , & ohno 1996 ) .    in order to characterize the hard component",
    ", we first fit the data in the 4 - 9 kev range with a thermal bremsstrahlung ( tb ) model plus a gaussian to account for the fe - k emission line .",
    "the centroid of the fe - k line is at @xmath27 = 6.55 kev ( 6.516.60 , 3@xmath26 ) , and the tb temperature is @xmath52 = 2.5 kev ( 1.64.2 , 3@xmath26 ) . for a collisional equilibrium ionization model , such as raymond - smith",
    ", the centroid of the strongest fe - k lines should be @xmath0 6.7 kev ( he - like ) and @xmath0 6.95 kev ( h - like ) .",
    "the low fitted centroid energy indicates that the hard component has not reached ionization equilibrium ( borkowski & szymkowiak 1997 ) , and should be characterized by a nei model .",
    "we use a number of nei models ( borkowski , in preparation ) , which are now released in xspec  11 :    * , which comprises a superposition of components of different ionization ages appropriate for a plane - parallel shock .",
    "this model is characterized by the constant electron temperature , @xmath34 , and the shock ionization age , @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the pre - shock density , and @xmath53 is the age of the shock ; the post - shock density is constant ) .",
    "* , a constant - temperature , single - ionization time - scale nei model . * , a nei model based on the sedov dynamics , which includes a range of temperatures , as described above .",
    "a proper definition of ionization time - scale is the product of postshock electron density @xmath54 and age @xmath53 , because the plasma ionization state depends on @xmath55 .",
    "this is the parameter which enters any nei model , including the models just mentioned .",
    "but the quantity of most interest here is @xmath50 , which is equal to @xmath56 for cosmic abundance plasma and the strong shock rankine - hugoniot jump conditions ; @xmath2 here includes only hydrogen . for convenience ,",
    "we refer to both @xmath57 and @xmath50 as the ionization time - scale throughout this work .    in the 49 kev energy range ,",
    "data are fitted equally well with and models with the solar fe abundance . with the model ,",
    "we obtain @xmath58 = 2.45 ( 1.84.2 ) kev , @xmath50 = 3.1 ( 1.58.3 ) @xmath610@xmath7 @xmath5 s , and @xmath31 = 1.0 ( @xmath32=145 ) . as expected , the electron temperature in the model is equal to the tb temperature , and the plasma is underionized .",
    "we then fit the entire energy range ( 0.69 kev ) with various two - component models , using current nei models mentioned above , and we show the results in table  1 . in fitting the data , we added a gaussian near 3.1 kev to account for the emission line from argon , since current nei models do not include emission from this element .",
    "since the soft component is characterized by a relatively long ionization time - scale ( @xmath50 @xmath0 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , previous section ) , we can represent it using a model .",
    "we also represented the soft component with the  model , but because these fits are significantly worse ( with a reduced @xmath59 ) we do not include them in table  1 . the harder component is characterized by a lower ionization time - scale , and it is necessary to fit it with a nei model . from table  1 , we find that independently of the nei model used , the fitted temperatures , ionization time - scales , and emission measures ( @xmath60 ) are in reasonable agreement . the best fit two - component nei model , + , yields @xmath48 = 3.21 @xmath6 10@xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath61 = 0.19 kev , @xmath52 = 1.52 kev , @xmath62 = 5.6 @xmath6 10@xmath4 @xmath5 s , and @xmath63 = 6.0 @xmath6 10@xmath7 @xmath5 s ; where @xmath64 and @xmath65 refer to the low - temperature and high - temperature components respectively .",
    "the fit yields a reduced @xmath66 of 1.37 ( for 729 degrees of freedom ) . in figure 6",
    ", we show the  data fitted with the corresponding model .",
    "we note that when fitting the hard component with a @xmath67 model ( with the soft component fitted with or ) , we use both equipartition ( @xmath34=@xmath47 ) and non - equipartition ( @xmath34@xmath46@xmath47 ) models .",
    "we find that the non - equipartition model improves the fit , and the corresponding parameters are : @xmath49=1.73 kev , @xmath58=0.86 kev , @xmath50=9.6@xmath610@xmath7 ( @xmath5 s ) . in figure 7 , we show the confidence levels for the electron temperature , @xmath34 , versus the shock temperature , @xmath33 . for shock speeds and ionization timescales derived for the hot component ,",
    "coulomb heating is effective , and the mean electron temperature in the shocked gas is much larger than the postshock electron temperature @xmath34 , and equal to about 1.5 kev .",
    "the hot component temperature in all two - component fits is lower than the temperature of 2.45 kev derived from fitting the hard ( 49 kev ) component independently ( using with solar abundances ) .",
    "in addition , two - component models always produce too few counts at high energies .",
    "we believe that this is caused by presence of multi - temperature plasma in 3c  397 , with temperatures in the range 0.17 kev  2.5 kev , a likely possibility in view of the complex morphology of 3c  397 . because two - component fits are apparently too simple to describe  spectra , we attempted to fit a three - component model . this has not resulted in a better fit , presumably because the description of multi - temperature plasma in terms of just 3 components might still be grossly inadequate , while giving us too many parameters to be reliably determined from the spatially - integrated x - ray spectrum alone .",
    "more complex multi - component models might give a better fit , but the problem with a large number of parameters remains , so that we did not pursue multi - component fitting beyond a 3-component model .",
    "varying the metal abundances improves the spectral fitting , indicating that at least part of the x - ray spectrum may be associated with an ejecta component . using the + model",
    ", we froze the abundances of the hard component at their solar values , and varied the abundances of the elements producing strong lines in the soft component .",
    "we find that the absolute value of the abundances of the individual elements are highly uncertain , while their relative values are nearly the same .",
    "therefore , we indicate their ratio relative to si , relative to solar ( given by anders and grevesse 1989 ) . using the model ( with variable abundances ) for the soft component , we allow for the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , s , fe and ni to vary , with fe and ni tied together . we find that the fit improves by a @xmath68 = 324 , and yields @xmath69=4.0 ( 3.05.8 ) , @xmath70=5.8 ( 2.69.7 ) , @xmath71=1.3 ( 0.91.9 ) , @xmath72=22 ( 1728 ) , @xmath73=1.7 ( 04.3 ) ( 2@xmath26 , @xmath51=1.16 , @xmath32=728 )",

    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the hard component is associated with the blast wave , and the soft component with the ejecta , most likely of a core - collapse sn as derived from the observed abundance pattern .",
    "it is also possible that the hard component is not due to material shocked by the blast wave , but results from the shock entering very low - density regions , and that we should interpret the soft component as a sedov blast wave .",
    "we discuss both these possibilities below .",
    "if 3c  397 is an ejecta - dominated snr and the hard component associated with the blast wave , then we may estimate the parameters of the sn explosion using the sedov model ( table  1 ) .",
    "we use a distance of 10 kpc to 3c  397 , and estimate the physical parameters in units of @xmath90 . from the equation in hsc  83 below equation ( 10 ) , we can convert the measured emission measure ( @xmath60 ) into an upstream density @xmath2 . from the  hri image ( dr  99 ) ,",
    "the mean angular radius is about @xmath91 , implying @xmath92 pc . from table  1 ( + non - equipartition fit , last row ) , we determine @xmath93 @xmath5 ; then from hsc  83 : @xmath94 this implies a swept - up mass of 29 @xmath95 ( assuming a mean mass per particle @xmath19 of 1.4 ) , consistent with a massive progenitor and an evolutionary stage between ejecta - dominated and sedov .",
    "the parameters of the sn derived using the sedov non - equipartition fit to the hard component are summarized in table  5 .",
    "the sedov spectral fit actually overdetermines the snr parameters , since from the observed shock temperature and ionization time - scale alone we can find the remnant age and upstream density . equations ( 4a  4f ) in hsc  83 , with our measured values of @xmath96 k and @xmath97 @xmath5 s , give @xmath98 km s@xmath82 , @xmath99 erg , @xmath100 yr , and @xmath101 @xmath5 .",
    "this value of @xmath2 is , within the various uncertainties , consistent with that determined from the measured @xmath60 .",
    "the swept - up mass from @xmath102 is 40 @xmath103 ; in either case , we find a large mass , indicating massive progenitor , since if the ejected mass were only 1.4 @xmath95 , the remnant should show little or no evidence of ejecta by this time .",
    "in general , the morphology of the remnant , its location in the galactic plane , and the suggestion that the soft component dominating the x - ray spectrum is due to ejecta , favor a core - collapse explosion .",
    "we note that using the fit to the hard component only ( 4 - 9 kev ) , the model yields a higher temperature @xmath49=2.45 kev ( 1.84.2 kev ) , and a slightly lower ionization time - scale @xmath104=@xmath50= 3.1 ( 1.58.3 ) @xmath610@xmath7 @xmath5 s. the observed emission measure of @xmath60=0.0224 corresponds to @xmath105 @xmath5 . if the emission volume @xmath106 , with @xmath107 the filling factor , we find an upstream density @xmath108 @xmath5 implying a shock age @xmath109 yr . for a reasonable filling factor of 0.25 , these estimates are quite comparable to those from the sedov fits above and strengthen our confidence in them .",
    "we have thus accounted satisfactorily for the gross remnant properties using only the high - temperature component of the x - ray emission .",
    "what , then , of the low - temperature component ( table  1 ) with an emission measure larger by about 600 .",
    "if that component represents shocked ejecta , its mass can not greatly exceed that of shocked ism .",
    "the only way the emission measure can be greatly increased is if that material is very highly concentrated in small regions , since for a given total mass @xmath110 , @xmath111 with @xmath112 the ejecta filling factor .",
    "our fits then suggest that the ejected material , which is unlikely to comprise more than half the swept - up mass of order 30 @xmath95 , is concentrated in very small regions . the  hri image ( figure 12 , dr  99 ) , sensitive to the energy range from 0.4 to 2 kev , should illustrate the spatial location of the soft component material . that material appears to be distributed more or less like the radio emission , largely concentrated near the edges ( especially the western edge ) , with a small , bright region in the interior .",
    "however , if that material is concentrated into knots , the image might resemble what is observed .",
    "a good example of such clumpy ejecta is provided by optically - emitting o - rich knots in cas  a , which are the most dense , undecelerated ejecta fragments plowing through the ambient circumstellar medium .",
    "because of their high velocities , pressures in these knots are much higher than in the bulk of the shocked ejecta .",
    "we envision a similar situation in 3c  397 , where the soft x - rays with a large emission measure are produced by dense , fast - moving ejecta clumps , while emission from the large - scale reverse shock should be harder and much fainter .",
    "the ram - pressure compressed clumps of ejecta must be at pressures at least an order of magnitude higher than the pressure of the ambient , much more tenuous x - ray emitting gas , because of the factor of 600 larger @xmath60 for the soft x - ray component ( we expect at most a factor of @xmath113 larger @xmath60 for the x - ray emission from a large - scale reverse shock ) .",
    "future high spatial resolution observations with  and should provide enough information to confirm or refute this picture .      the soft x - ray component may alternatively be identified with the blast wave . while we obtained poor fits with the model",
    ", this component is well fit by the  model with temperature @xmath114 kev ( table  1 ) .",
    "if this temperature is identified with the post - shock temperature , we obtain 375 km s@xmath82 for the blast wave velocity .",
    "the preshock density @xmath2 may be estimated by noting ( for comparable filling factors for the two components ) that @xmath115 and that the emission measure ratio between the low- and high - temperature component is equal to @xmath116 .",
    "this gives @xmath117 cm @xmath118 , or a mean postshock electron density of about 160 @xmath5 , implying that the sn progenitor exploded in a particularly dense environment .",
    "when combined with the remnant s angular size , we obtain the total swept mass @xmath119 @xmath95 . assuming that the remnant s dynamics can be well described by a sedov dynamics , we estimate the total sn kinetic energy @xmath27 at @xmath120 ergs , parameter @xmath121 ergs @xmath43 , ionization timescale @xmath122 @xmath5 s , and the snr age @xmath123 . at this stage of its evolution",
    ", the remnant may be at the transition from the sedov stage to the radiative stage , because this transition should occur at @xmath124 yr , an age equal to the estimated snr age .",
    "the high - temperature component in this picture of a middle - aged snr must come from the hot interior of 3c  397 , occupied by gas shocked by a high velocity shock earlier in the evolution of the remnant .",
    "it is likely that this gas completely fills the remnant s interior , i.  e. , its volume filling fraction is equal to @xmath125 . with this filling fraction",
    ", we deduce that its electron density @xmath54 is approximately equal to 2.5 @xmath5 . because ionization timescale of this hot component is equal to @xmath126 @xmath5 s ( or @xmath127 @xmath5 s ) in the model ( table  1 ) , the hot gas was shocked about @xmath128 yr ago , certainly a reasonable timescale for a 5000 yr old remnant .",
    "the mass of the hot gas is equal to 30 @xmath95 , and its pressure appears to be 68 times lower than pressure in the low - temperature component .",
    "this is somewhat lower than a ratio of 3 expected in a sedov model .",
    "it is possible that the volume filling fraction of the high - temperature component is 23 lower than we assumed , and then its pressure would be higher than derived above .",
    "if this is the case , then most of the snr volume would have to be occupied by a very tenuous hot gas with a negligible emission measure .",
    "the origin of the high - temperature component is not clear in the framework of the middle - aged snr .",
    "its presence may indicate significant departures from a uniform ambient medium , because sedov models can not produce such a strong high - temperature component . because mass of the hot interior gas is nearly 20 times smaller than the mass of the swept shell",
    ", this material was shocked early in the evolution of the remnant , and originated relatively close to the sn progenitor .",
    "we expect the sn progenitor to be a massive star , which is likely to be found near the place of its birth and associated with dense ism .",
    "but massive sn progenitors modify the distribution of the ambient medium in its vicinity , blowing stellar winds and creating dense gaseous shells .",
    "we then would naturally expect deviations from the sedov dynamics early in the evolution of the remnant .",
    "perhaps the hot - temperature component is the relic from earlier stages of the snr evolution , when the blast wave encountered an ambient medium strongly modified by the sn progenitor .",
    "another possibility is that the overall dynamics of 3c  397 are poorly described by the sedov solution .",
    "we have already concluded that radiative cooling is likely to be important in the 3c  397 shell , which could decrease the shell temperature and enhance soft x - ray emission .",
    "the ambient ism may also be clumpy , a likely possibility in view of a generally inhomogeneous nature of dense ism , which could also affect the remnant s dynamics and its x - ray emission .",
    "finally , neglected physical processes such as electron thermal conduction may have caused significant departures from the sedov solution .",
    "for example , cox  ( 1999 ) estimate that the central density at the time of transition from the sedov stage to the radiative stage is approximately 10 times lower than the preshock density in snr models with thermal conduction .",
    "because the density ratio between the preshock gas and the high - temperature component in 3c  397 is also of this order , we attempted to fit  spectra with the thermal conduction models kindly provided to us by randall smith ( these models were used by shelton  1999 to model snr w44 ) .",
    "while the resulting fits have not produced better results that our one - component fit with the _ sedov _ model , models with thermal conduction are still a viable alternative because the existing set of models was designed for snrs with much lower preshock densities , such as w44",
    ". a more serious problem might be the lack of evidence for elemental enrichment in the hot component , as we would expect a moderate enhancement of fe in the remnant s interior .",
    "a detailed study of the 3c  397 dynamics , clearly outside the scope of our present work , is required in order to understand the nature of the high - temperature component in the framework of a middle - aged snr .      in the following ,",
    "we discuss the possibility that the hard component is synchrotron emission from highly relativistic particles accelerated at the snr shock .",
    "we show that a power - law description results in reasonable parameter values , while a somewhat better motivated cutoff synchrotron model ( reynolds 1998 ) describes the data as well , giving results consistent with reynolds and keohane ( 1999 ) which involved highly simplified spectral fits . for power - law models ,",
    "the index , @xmath86 , is highly dependent on fitting the soft component , being steep ( @xmath86 @xmath0 3.4 ) when the soft component is fitted with a  or  model , and harder for a sedov fit ( @xmath86 @xmath0 2 ) . in the following",

    "the total energy in the electron distribution out to x - ray emitting energies is @xmath133 @xmath0 0.7 @xmath6 10@xmath134 @xmath135 erg ;",
    "@xmath136 being the magnetic field in units of 10@xmath130 g. this represents a small fraction of the sn explosion energy .",
    "the synchrotron lifetime of an electron emitting @xmath0 9 kev x - rays is @xmath137 @xmath0 650 @xmath138 years .",
    "the typical electron energies producing the synchrotron photons of energy @xmath139 can be estimated to be @xmath140 tev .",
    "a power - law spectrum is not expected to arise naturally in the high - energy part of the electron spectrum ; rather , one expects a slow rolloff from the low - frequency synchrotron power - law .",
    "the simplest description of this rolloff is the synchrotron spectrum from an exponentially cut off power - law electron distribution @xmath141 , the `` cutoff '' synchrotron model ( reynolds 1998 ) , called @xmath142 in xspec . in @xmath142 , the fitted roll - off frequency , @xmath87 ,",

    "this value is in agreement with the upper limit derived by keohane ( 1998 ) and reynolds and keohane ( 1999 ) . a synchrotron explanation for the hard component results in reasonable parameters whether it is described by a power law or by the cutoff model ; better observations will be needed to see if such a component is demanded by the data .",
    "the presence of a pulsar - powered component ( plerion ) is suggested by the hri image showing the hot spot at the center of the remnant .",
    "we subsequently estimate the intrinsic parameters from a hidden pulsar taking the hard component luminosity as an upper limit on a plerionic contribution .",
    "we assume a crab - like plerion , and use the empirical formula derived by seward & wang ( 1988 ) , @xmath148 ( erg s@xmath82 ) = 1.39 @xmath149 -16.6 ; where @xmath83 represents the x - ray luminosity of the plerion in the 0.24 kev band .",

    "this implies a spin - down luminosity of @xmath151 @xmath12 2 @xmath6 10@xmath152 erg s@xmath82 , and a period of @xmath153 @xmath14 0.08(s ) ( @xmath154 @xmath155)@xmath156 ; where @xmath155 is the spin - down luminosity in units of 10@xmath152 erg s@xmath82 , and @xmath154 is the pulsar s age in units of 10@xmath157 years .",
    "we stress that these parameters are derived assuming that the hard component arises entirely from a plerion .",
    "these are extreme limits since the hard band gis image indicates that the hard x - ray emission peaks at the western lobe , with some emission from the central spot ( figure 2 ) . assuming that only @xmath0 10% of the hard component arises from the central hot spot ,",
    "then the spin - down luminosity would be @xmath12 4@xmath610@xmath158 erg s@xmath82 , and the period @xmath153 @xmath14 0.12 @xmath154@xmath156 s.    a synchrotron component in the x - ray spectrum of 3c  397 could be also associated with a central engine injecting relativistic particles , which as they encounter a strong shock , would produce the high - energy non - thermal tail ( up to @xmath14 9 kev ) .",
    "such a process is known to occur in the snr w50 powered by the jet source ss433 ( safi - harb & petre 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the axial ratio of 2:1 in 3c  397 is similar to that in w50 , in which the bloating results from the interaction between the jets in ss433 and the snr shell .",
    "we have presented , ,  and  observations of 3c  397 .",
    "the  high - resolution hri image shows a central hot spot , possibly associated with a compact object whose nature remains a mystery , as no x - ray pulsations nor a radio counterpart have been found .",
    "the  and  images show that the remnant is highly asymmetric , having a double - lobed morphology similar to the radio shell . the hard band image obtained",
    "with the  gis overlayed on the  hri image shows that the hard emission peaks at the western lobe , with little hard x - ray emission originating from the central spot .    the spectrum is heavily absorbed , and dominated by thermal emission with emission lines evident from mg , si , s , ar and fe .",
    "single - component models fail to fit the  spectra ( 0.6 - 9 kev ) .",
    "even a model ( a nei model including a range of temperatures ) does not account for the emission above @xmath0 4 kev .",
    "two components , at least , are required to fit the data : a soft component , characterized by a large ionization time - scale , and a hard component , required to account for the fe - k emission line and characterized by a much lower ionization time - scale .",
    "we use a set of nei models , and find that the fitted parameters are robust .",
    "the temperatures from the soft and hard component are @xmath0 0.2 kev and @xmath0 1.6 kev respectively .",
    "the corresponding ionization time - scales @xmath1 are @xmath0 6 @xmath6 10@xmath4 @xmath5 s and @xmath0 6 @xmath6 10@xmath7 @xmath5 s respectively .",
    "the large @xmath1 of the soft component indicates that it is approaching ionization equilibrium , and it can be fitted equally well with a collisional equilibrium ionization model . the 515 kev pca spectrum , though contaminated by the emission from the galactic ridge , allowed us to confirm the thermal nature of the hard x - ray emission .",
    "fitting the hard component ( 515 kev band ) yields , however , a higher shock temperature ( @xmath49 @xmath0 2.3 kev ) than the one derived from fitting the entire band with two - component models ( table  1 ) . a third component originating from a pulsar - driven component is possible , but the contamination of the source signal by the galactic ridge did not allow us to determine its parameters , or find pulsations from any hidden pulsar .",
    "we discuss the two - component model in the light of two scenarios : a young ejecta - dominated remnant of a core - collapse sn , and a medium - aged snr in a dense ism .",
    "+ in the first scenario , the hot component would arise from the blast wave and the soft component from the ejecta .",
    "the derived age ( a few thousand years ) and the presence of a central x - ray source makes 3c  397 similar to the young snrs g11.20.3 ( vasisht  1996 ) , kes  73 ( gotthelf & vasisht 1997 ) , and rcw  103 ( petre & gotthelf 1998 ) .",
    "g11.20.3 harbors a hard x - ray plerion powered by a fast millisecond pulsar ( torii  1997 ) .",
    "kes  73 and rcw  103 harbor radio - quiet x - ray sources : an anomalous x - ray pulsar in kes  73 ( vasisht & gotthelf 1997 ) , and a low - mass x - ray binary candidate in rcw  103 ( garmire  2000 , iau circ 7350 ) .",
    "if a central neutron star exists in 3c  397 , as suggested by the  hri image , then it must be radio quiet .",
    "the absence of both a radio spot and x - ray pulsations could be then attributed to a cooling neutron star , an anomalous or binary x - ray pulsar , or a weak x - ray plerion buried underneath the snr .",
    "did not allow an accurate measurement of its spectrum due to the heavy interstellar absorption towards 3c  397 , and the narrow energy band of .",
    "future  observations will unveil its nature .",
    "we note that recently ,  observations of casa snr revealed a central radio - quiet x - ray source ( pavlov  2000 ) , and that a new 424 ms ( radio - quiet ) x - ray pulsar has been discovered with  observations of the snr pks 1209 - 52 ( zavlin  2000 ) .",
    "the hybrid x - ray morphology of 3c  397 , with both shell and central emission , combined with its age , makes it a unique snr ",
    "perhaps a transition object from a shell ( like the historical snrs ) into a composite that is well into the sedov phase of evolution ( like vela ) .    in the second scenario ( a middle - aged snr ) ,",
    "the soft component would represent the emission from the snr expanding in a dense medium .",
    "the hard component would arise from the hot interior shocked by a fast shock earlier in the evolution of the remnant .",
    "alternatively , a sedov model invoking thermal conduction would modify the sedov dynamics , and produce a hot inner component ( as was proposed for the snr w44 ; cox  1999 ) .",
    "in this scenario , the snr would be entering its radiative phase , and would emit in the infrared . a 1ks exposure obtained with the two - micron all - sky survey ( mass ) infrared telescope at ipac reveals , in the j band , faint diffuse emission in the northern part of the snr ( j.  rho , private communication ) .",
    "the extent of the diffuse emission to the west is , however , confused with bright stars in the field .",
    "no emission was detected from 3c  397 in the far infra - red .",
    "furthermore , hi and co observations should reveal the presence of a radiative shell and its interaction with a dense medium ( as found for w44 , ic 443 , and 3c391 : chevalier 1999 ) . to our knowledge ,",
    "no evidence of an hi shell or co emission is found to be associated with 3c  397 .",
    "the current picture we present here is therefore marginally consistent with this scenario , but it can not be excluded .    differentiating between the two scenarios requires a spatially resolved spectroscopy as well as more detailed modeling ( which is outside the scope of this paper ) . in particular",
    ", high spatial resolution x - ray data combined with broadband energy coverage is required to resolve the central component from the outer shell , and unveil the nature of the mysterious x - ray spot .",
    "this could be achieved with  and .",
    "furthermore , future gamma - ray observations with high - spatial resolution ( such as @xmath159 ) will help look for a high - energy tail and test for models with a radiative shell .",
    "since 3c  397 is heavily absorbed , infra - red observations will be crucial to trace the presence of radiative shocks .",
    "in particular , searching for [ oi ] 63@xmath19 m line emission will be a powerful probe to test for the radiative model .",
    "finally , observations with millimeter telescopes will enable us to get a better estimate of the kinematic distance to 3c  397 , and measure the density profile of the medium into which it is propagating .",
