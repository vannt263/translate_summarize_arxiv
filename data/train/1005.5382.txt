    "<S> we calculate the density matrix for the decay of a polarised top quark into a polarised @xmath0 boson and a massive @xmath1 quark , for the most general @xmath2 vertex arising from dimension - six gauge - invariant effective operators . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in addition to the well - known @xmath0 helicity fractions , for polarised top decays it is worth defining and studying the transverse and normal @xmath0 polarisation fractions , that is , the @xmath0 polarisation along two directions orthogonal to its momentum . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a rather simple forward - backward asymmetry in the normal direction is found to be very sensitive to complex phases in one of the @xmath2 anomalous couplings . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry , which indicates a normal @xmath0 polarisation , can be generated for example by a p - odd , t - odd transition electric dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the angular distribution of decay products in the top quark rest frame , calculating the spin analysing powers for a general @xmath2 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show that , using a combined fit to top decay observables and the @xmath3 cross section , at lhc it will be possible to obtain model - independent measurements of all the ( complex ) @xmath2 couplings as well as the single top polarisation . </S>",
