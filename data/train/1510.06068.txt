    "a nonzero permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) of a nondegenerate state of a system with spin @xmath6 violates invariance under time reversal as well as invariance under parity operation .",
    "the violation of time reversal invariance implies a violation of invariance under @xmath7 operation ( combined operations of parity and charge conjugation ) through the @xmath8 theorem .",
    "searches for new sources of @xmath7 violation through searches of edm are strongly motivated for the following reasons : ( 1 )  the amount of @xmath7 violation contained in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics through the complex phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is known to be insufficient for generating the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe ( therefore it is expected that there are other sources of @xmath7 violation ) .",
    "( 2 )  the other source of @xmath7 violation contained in the sm , the so - called @xmath9 term in the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) lagrangian , is constrained by nonobservation of the neutron edm ( nedm ) to be unnaturally small .",
    "( 3 )  the sm value of edms based on the ckm phase are highly suppressed because in the sm the @xmath7 violation processes are quark flavor - changing at the tree level .",
    "( 4 )  many extensions of the sm contain new sources of @xmath7 violation , predicting much larger values of edms .",
    "the search for the neutron edm ( nedm ) was pioneered by smith , purcell , and ramsey.@xcite in the subsequent 60 odd years , many more experiments have been performed with increasingly refined experimental methods and with correspondingly improved sensitivities and upper limits .",
    "( for a review of experimental searches for the nedm , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .  .",
    ") many of these experiments have looked for the nedm by subjecting spin polarized neutrons to static magnetic and electric fields and looking for the possible change in the spin precession frequency corresponding to the change in the relative orientation of the electric field with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "whereas early experiments were performed using a beam of cold neutrons , all recent experiments have used stored ultracold neutrons ( ucns)@xcite to suppress the effect of the motional magnetic field@xcite ( see , however , ref .  ) .",
    "the statistical sensitivity of such measurements for a batch of stored ucns depends on three quantities , namely , @xmath10 the strength of the electric field , @xmath11 the free precession time , and @xmath12 the number of neutrons in the batch , and is expressed as follows : @xmath13 typically many such measurements are repeated over the duration of an experiment .",

    "in addition , processes responsible for electrical breakdown initiated at the electrode - insulator junction , thought to be one the factors limiting the achievable electric field strength for previous room temperature nedm experiments , are expected to be suppressed in lhe . therefore a larger @xmath10 can be expected .",
    "performing a measurement at cryogenic temperatures suppresses some of the loss mechanisms for stored ucns , resulting in longer @xmath11.@xcite producing ucns directly in the experiment from a 0.89  nm cold neutron beam is expected to provide a larger @xmath12 .",
    "of critical importance to the development of this experiment is to establish the highest electric field that can be applied and be sustained stably in the volume inside the measurement cells because the sensitivity of the experiment directly depends on the strength of the applied electric field .",

    "the design goal for the sns nedm experiment is to have an electric field of 75  kv / cm stably applied in the volume inside the so - called measurement cells , the volumes filled with 0.4  k lhe that stores ucns . the measurement cell walls will be made of poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) , as they will serve as part of the light collection system",
    ". they will be 10.16  @xmath23 12.70  cm @xmath24 42  cm in outer dimension with a wall thickness of 1.2  cm .",
    "the two measurement cells will be sandwiched between electrodes , roughly @xmath25  cm  @xmath24  40  @xmath23  80  cm in size .",
    "the electrodes and the measurement cells will be immersed in 0.4  k lhe .",
    "there are a number of requirements on the electrode materials .",
    "they are :    1 .   in order to match the thermal contraction of the measurement cells made of pmma , which shrinks @xmath01% when cooled from room temperature to 0.4  k",
    ", the electrodes need to be made of a material that has similar thermal contraction characteristics to pmma .",
    "the current design is to use pmma as the electrode substrate material and make the electrode surface conducting using methods including : ( 1 )  coating with appropriate materials and ( 2 )  implanting conducting materials into the surface layer .",
    "2 .   the material can not have too high an electrical conductivity .",
    "this requirement comes from the requirement on johnson noise on the superconducting quantum interference device ( squid)-based magnetometer to measure the precession frequency of spin polarized @xmath21he atoms and also from the requirement on joule heating from eddy currents due to the radio frequency ( rf ) field for dressed spin measurement.@xcite the allowed surface resistivity is 100  @xmath26  @xmath27 at the operating temperature of @xmath00.4  k. 3 .",
    "the material should be non - magnetic .",
    "the static magnetic field in the region inside the measurement cells , which is approximately 1  @xmath28 t , needs to be uniform to @xmath29 and needs to have field gradients smaller than 5  pt / cm in the direction of the static field and 10  pt / cm in the direction perpendicular to the static field .",
    "because of this stringent requirement , many of the so - called `` non - magnetic '' technical materials , such as stainless steel and inconel , are disallowed .",
    "also , materials that become superconducting can not be used because the field expelled due to the meissner effect would disturb the field uniformity inside the measurement cells .",
    "the material should not have large neutron absorption properties , as such materials would become radioactively activated due to the exposure to a high flux neutron beam and become source of background radiation .",
    "the current candidate methods for making the pmma electrode surface conducting include graphite paint and copper ion implantation .",
    "in addition , the leakage currents along the cell walls need to be minimized .",
    "this requirement comes from the following considerations .    *",
    "these currents produce magnetic fields that are correlated with the direction of the electric field and therefore can produce effects that mimic the signal of nedm ( this applies to all nedm experiments that use stored ucn ) . * in the current design , the necessary hv will be generated inside the lhe volume using a gain capacitor . in this method",
    ", the nedm experiment will be run with the hv electrode disconnected from the hv power supply .",
    "leakage currents lead to a reduction of the electric field over time . *",
    "these currents produce heat , generating phonons in superfluid lhe and modifying the spatial distribution of the @xmath21he atoms via the @xmath21he - phonon interactions .",
    "a schematic of the central part of the sns nedm experiment , as it is currently designed , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdsschematic ] .",
    "electrical breakdown in liquid helium has been studied extensively@xcite because of its importance in cooling superconducting components , principally high field magnets . in general ,",
    "the experimental measurements of breakdown show little consistency , varying with geometry , electrode material , bubble formation and unexplained parameters .",
    "an electron with low kinetic energy forms a bubble in liquid helium . because of the overlap with the electrons of the helium atoms , a free electron has a lower energy by close to an ev compared to that when it is in the conduction band .",
    "the radius of the bubble is about 19 . in a high electric field",
    ", an electron does not escape the bubble .",
    "its motion is constrained by viscous damping or in the superfluid state by the creation of vortex rings or rotons , depending on pressure .",
    "in contrast , because of electrostriction , positive he ions form solid - like structures with surrounding atoms called `` snowballs . ''",
    "the kinetic energy of a snowball in an electric field is also limited by damping and vortex ring creation",
    ". neither electron bubbles nor positive ion snowballs can be the source of breakdown in liquid helium .    an electron created in the conduction band in a high electric field , on the other hand , can in principle lead to breakdown by electron impact ionization . however , the breakdown field of bulk liquid helium is calculated to be very high",
    ". the mean free path of a conduction electron , limited by elastic scattering from he atoms , is only about 100 nm and the ionization energy of he is 24.6 ev .",
    "belevtsev@xcite has made a detailed theoretical study of electron multiplication induced by an electric field in liquid helium starting from the kinetic boltzmann equation .",
    "taking into account the various electron energy loss mechanisms , he finds that the first townsend coefficient reaches a value of 1  @xmath30 at a field of 1.5  mv / cm rising to 102  @xmath30 at 2.5  mv / cm .",
    "hence , breakdown by electron impact ionization in any reasonable sized volume of helium can be expected to occur only at a field in the low mv / cm region , well above the fields of interest for this experiment .",
    "breakdown fields around or below  100 kv / cm have been commonly reported in the literature for liquid helium .",
    "these observations are presumed to be the result of phenomena occurring at the cathode . if the field emission of electrons on a rough surface can occur because of extremely high local fields at sharp asperities , local heating can result in vapor bubble formation leading to electron multiplication and vapor growth proceeding together .",
    "breakdown is then the result of a vapor column extending to the anode .",
    "note that in other dielectric liquids , formation and growth of vapor bubbles associated with electrical breakdown have been observed experimentally@xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "it follows that the parameters that can affect the breakdown field strength include : ( 1 ) electrode material , in particular the surface properties and ( 2 ) lhe temperature and pressure ( vapor growth can depend on the pressure ) .",
    "note that lhe is unique among liquids in that its svp changes drastically as a function of the temperature .",
    "for example , the svp is 760  torr at 4.2  k and is @xmath0@xmath31  torr at 0.4  k.    in addition , because electrical breakdown is a stochastic process , the size of the system affects the breakdown field strength and its distribution , as shown in ref .  ,",
    "in which the experimentally measured dependence of the breakdown field on the electrode surface area was shown to agree with a prediction based on the measured breakdown field distribution for electrodes of a particular size and the theory of extreme values , for the case in which transformer oil was used as insulator fluid .    in general , particles and other contamination in the liquid",
    "affect the electrical breakdown properties.@xcite in the case of lhe , however , it is expected that they play a less important role because all possible contaminating species freeze at lhe temperature .",
    "additionally solid particles ( made of _",
    "metal ) would most likely settle at the bottom of a container due to the low density of lhe ( @xmath32  g / cm@xmath21 for @xmath34  k ) .",
    "the considerations given above indicate that the r&d for the sns nedm experiment requires a study of electrical breakdown in lhe in a condition ( _ i.e. _ temperature , pressure , and size ) close to that expected for the sns nedm experiment , using suitable electrode candidate materials .",
    "it is also very important to study the effect of the presence of a dielectric insulator sandwiched between electrodes , as such will be the geometry for the sns nedm experiment . note that even in a room temperature vacuum system , electric fields exceeding a few 100  kv / cm are possible when there is no insulator directly sandwiched between the two electrodes . in a study performed using a room temperature vacuum apparatus@xcite similar to those used in the previous nedm experiments ( such as ref .  )",
    ", the electric field was limited to @xmath030  kv / cm due to the presence of the ucn confining wall that was sandwiched between the two electrodes .",
    "( in the actual nedm experiment , the achievable field was further lowered to @xmath35  kv / cm due to other factors . )",
    "field emission at the cathode - insulator junction is thought to be responsible for initiating breakdown,@xcite which is temperature independent .",
    "however , we expect the processes responsible for leading field emission to breakdown to be suppressed in lhe .    in order to study the relevant aspects of electrical breakdown in lhe with a goal of establishing the feasibility of the sns nedm experiment as well as guiding the design of the apparatus",
    ", we constructed an apparatus called the medium scale hv ( mshv ) test apparatus , which is described in this paper .",
    "there are some important design aspects that required close attention to ensure that the apparatus yielded properly interpretable results .",
    "the inconsistencies seen in previous results may well have been partly due to lack of proper attention to these aspects .",
    "one is proper electrostatic design . as discussed earlier , because electrical breakdown is a stochastic process",
    ", the size of the system affects the breakdown field strength and its distribution .",
    "it is therefore important to have a good understanding of the area of the electrodes that is exposed to high fields ( and/or the size of the stressed dielectric volume ) for proper interpretation of the results .",
    "for example , in a typical plane - to - plane geometry in which electrodes are made of a flat disk whose edge is rounded with a constant radius of curvature , it can be shown that the field is the highest where the flat surface connects to the rounded edge .",
    "if the distance between the two such electrodes is varied in order to study the gap size dependence of the breakdown field , one can be led to erroneous results because the ratio between the highest field and the field at the center of the electrodes increases as the gap size is increased . in order to study the breakdown field in a plane - to - plane geometry , so - called uniform field electrodes need to be used .",
    "another is proper heat management . due to the rather low heat of vaporization of liquid helium ( 83  j / mol ) , a small amount of heat transmitted to the electrodes through hv feed lines can boil lhe on the electrode surfaces , creating bubbles and significantly reducing the breakdown field .",
    "it is , therefore , of critical importance to properly thermally anchor hv feed lines .",
    "similarly , it is important to make sure that all components in the system are properly cooled before any measurements are taken . performing breakdown field measurements before a sufficient amount of heat",
    "is removed from all the relevant components can lead to erroneous results due to boiling of lhe caused by residual heat in the system .",
    "we used a @xmath21he refrigerator to cool the central volume ( cv ) , the volume that contains lhe and houses electrodes to be tested , to the operating temperature of 0.4  k. the size of the cv was determined by striking a balance between the following two competing factors :    * short turnaround time ( time from the beginning of one cooldown to the beginning of the next ) of the system ( @xmath02  weeks ) to allow multiple electrode material candidates to be tested . *",
    "size large enough to give information relevant for the sns nedm experiment .",
    "the chosen size of the cv holds 6  liters of lhe , housing a set of electrodes 12  cm in diameter .",
    "the gap size is adjustable between 1 and 2  cm .",
    "each dimension is within a factor of 5 or so of the sns nedm experiment s measurement cell electrodes .",
    "since we expect the pressure to be an important parameter affecting the breakdown field strength in lhe , the mshv system is designed so that the pressure of the lhe volume in which the electrodes are placed can be varied between the svp and @xmath0600  torr .",
    "a schematic of the mshv system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : schematic ] , the mshv cryostat consists of the following major components :    * outer vacuum chamber ( ovc ) , which separates the insulating vacuum from the atmosphere . *",
    "ln@xmath36 reservoir and the 77  k heat shield attached to it , * 4  k lhe bath . * inner vacuum chamber ( ivc ) , which also serves as a 4  k heat shield .",

    "the dimension of the ovc is 50.8  cm in diameter and 185  cm in height .",
    "the ivc is made of 1100 series al alloy for its excellent thermal conductivity .",
    "the ivc allows introduction of exchange gas to help cool the @xmath21he refrigerator insert and the cv in the process of cooldown .    a diagram of the plumbing of the mshv system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plumbing ] .",
    ", width=336 ]    the cv is cooled by the @xmath21he pot through a heat exchanger mounted at the bottom of the @xmath21he pot .",
    "the heat exchanger is made by cutting slots into a block of oxygen - free high thermal conductivity ( ofhc ) copper with electrical discharge machining .",
    "there are two lines connected to the cv .",
    "one is the `` fill '' line , which connects the 4  k lhe bath to the cv through manual valve mv2 , located at the bottom of the 4  k lhe bath .",
    "the primary purpose of the fill line is to introduce lhe into the cv .",
    "the fill line is thermally anchored at the 1  k pot .",
    "the other is the `` pump out '' line , which connects the cv to a vacuum pump through a large - aperture ( 6.35  mm ) superfluid - tight valve mv1.@xcite the primary purpose of the pump out line is to evacuate the cv prior to a cooldown of the system and remove lhe from the cv during a warmup of the system .",
    "opening mv2 allows lhe to flow from the 4  k lhe bath to the cv .",
    "leaving it open keeps the pressure of the lhe inside the cv at the pressure of the lhe inside the 4  k lhe bath , which is typically 600  torr , primarily determined by the atmopheric pressure in los alamos , new mexico , usa ( elevation @xmath02000  m ) .",
    "note that there is a temperature gradient established in the lhe column inside the cv fill line , and the associated flow of heat to the cv , in this mode of operation .",
    "closing mv2 and pumping on the fill line to remove lhe from the fill line allows the pressure in the cv to be reduced .",
    "the pressure in the cv will be the svp of lhe at the temperature at the location of the liquid surface , which is somewhere in the fill line .",
    "the diameter and length of the cv fill line were determined as a compromise between the following two competing factors :    * heat flow rate . during operation ,",
    "when the cv fill line is filled with lhe , there is a continuous flow of heat through the lhe from the 1  k pot to the cv , which is typically operated at 0.4  k. this must be sufficiently small so that it does not affect the temperature of the cv . *",
    "he flow rate .",
    "the cv needs to be filled within a reasonable amount of time .",
    "we evaluated the heat flow rate from 1.5  k to 0.4  k through a superfluid lhe column as a function of the diameter for selected lengths according to ref .   using various thermodynamic quantities of lhe found in ref .",
    "furthermore , we estimated the pressure drop necessary to have a sufficient flow to fill the cv in 24 hours using formulas from ref .  .",
    "as a result of these evaluations , we chose the following for the length and the diameter of the fill line :    * lhe to 1  k pot : 47 cm long , 0.7  mm inner diameter * 1  k pot to cv : 76 cm long , 0.7  mm inner diameter    the pump out line is @xmath06  mm in inner diameter .",

    "the vessel is also equipped with a cryogenic burst disk@xcite with a bursting pressure of 8.6  bar .",
    "this pressure rating of the cv was determined based on the following safety considerations .",
    "if the electricity to run the pumps for the @xmath21he is lost during the operation of the system , then the temperature of the cv will slowly rise and will remain at @xmath04  k as long as there is lhe in the 4  k lhe bath , as the cv is inside the 4  k heat shield . if the system is left unattended with mv2 closed , then the lhe inside the cv is confined and the pressure inside the cv will rise as the temperature of the cv rises .",

    "in addition to several temperature sensors , both silicon diodes and ruthenium oxide sensors , two lhe level sensors are installed inside the cv .",

    "we used two model af-100r0.1 100  kv dc hv power supplies from matsusada precision inc .",
    "hv was supplied to each hv feed line through a 1  g@xmath42 hv resistor in order to limit the energy released inside the cv when an electrical breakdown occurs .",
    "the energy stored in the system is dominated by that stored in the room temperature hv cable connecting the power supply to the mshv system , which has a capacitance of @xmath0300  pf .",
    "therefore , the hv resistance was placed between ft1 and the room temperature hv cable .",
    "the goal of the initial hv test was to establish the electric field strength that is possible with an electrode material known to be capable of good performance .",
    "therefore , the initial electrodes were made of electropolished stainless steel .",
    "stainless steel is one of the materials that are known to give higher breakdown fields than others .    for the shape of the electrodes , we chose the so - called rogowski profile,@xcite which provides a uniform electric field in the gap and ensures that the gap has the highest field in the system . figure  [ fig : electrodes ] shows a result of a finite element electrostatic calculation , performed using comsol,@xcite of the rogowski electrodes that we used .",
    "we also performed finite element electrostatic calculations for other known uniform field electrode ( ufe ) shapes , such as that by chang@xcite and that by ernst.@xcite we did not see a significant difference among these ufe shapes in terms of the uniformity of the electric field in the gap and of the area over which the field is uniform .",
    "for the chosen geometry , the field is uniform to 2% over @xmath064  @xmath43 .",
    "kv.[fig : electrodes],width=336 ]    we decided to electropolish the electrodes based on the following considerations .",
    "a protrusion on the electrode surface would cause a spot with higher electric field ( a `` hot spot '' ) .",
    "the strength of the field on such a hot spot does not depend on the size of the protrusion but on its shape , as long as the size of the protrusion is much smaller than the distance between two electrodes .",
    "for example , if a half sphere is embedded on a surface of a flat electrode that forms a parallel plate capacitor and the field between the two plates is @xmath44 in the absence of the half sphere , then the field on the top of the half sphere is @xmath45 , regardless of the size of the half sphere , as long as the radius @xmath46 of the sphere is much smaller than the distance @xmath47 between the two plates.@xcite the lack of dependence of the field strength on the size of the sphere can be easily understood by realizing that there is no length scale in the problem when @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that the amount of the field strength enhancement due to features on the electrode surface depends on the shape of the features but not on the size .",
    "surface smoothness is typically expressed in terms of the size of the features on the surface and mechanical polishing processes reduce the size of the features . however , it is not the relevant quantity in this case .",
    "electropolishing on the other hand is expected to make the shape of the features smoother .",
    "for this reason , we decided to electropolish the first set of electrodes , although the difference between electropolished surfaces and machine polished surfaces needs to be ultimately studied experimentally .",
    "figure  [ fig : cv_and_electrodes ] shows how the electrodes were mounted inside the cv .",
    "the electrodes were supported by a `` cage '' made of fiberglass - reinforced plastic ( frp ) , in this case , g-10 . a spacer ring made of frp",
    "was bolted onto the back of each electrode with a set of unfilled torlon bolts .",
    "the spacers were then mounted onto the end caps of the frp cage using torlon bolts .",
    "with such a supporting structure , the electrodes were expected to remain parallel to each other to @xmath00.1@xmath39 when cooled . with the aid of comsol - based electrostatic calculations",
    ", we determined that with the expected tolerance within which the two electrodes can be located , the effect of possible misalignment ( both angular and translational ) of the electrodes on the field uniformity and the area over which the field is uniform would be insignificant .",
    "the effect of the supporting structure on the electric field distribution was also evaluated as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : electrodes ] .",
    "the hv lines were included in the electrostatic modeling to see the strength of the field on the surface .    ]",
    "the second test we performed was to study the effect of having a dielectric object sandwiched between two electrodes .",
    "as indicated earlier , it is well known that when a dielectric object is inserted between two electrodes , the holdoff voltage is reduced , which is thought to be due to field emission at the cathode - insulator junction and emitted electrons running along the insulator surface.@xcite a traditional solution to this problem is to embed the end of the insulator into a groove.@xcite the idea is to `` hide '' the edges of the insulator in a low field region to avoid the enhancement of the field at the cathode - insulator junction due to the higher dielectric constant of the dielectric .",
    "designs in which the insulator surface is at 45@xmath39 with respect to the flat electrode surface are also used , in particular for pulsed high - power high - voltage applications.@xcite however the latter method is not suitable for our application .",
    "we used a pmma cylinder 6.35  cm in od and 5.08  cm in i d as our dielectric insert .",
    "we designed a set of electrodes with a groove with the help of finite element electrostatic analysis using comsol.@xcite figure  [ fig : grooved_electrodes ] shows results from such electrostatic calculations .",
    "the shape of the groove was adjusted so that the highest field in the system , which occurs on the rounded corner of the groove , is less than @xmath01.15 times the uniform field in the middle of the electrodes with and without the dielectric insert .",
    "we started with a groove 5.5  mm deep and 8.4  mm wide ( 2  mm larger than the insulator s wall thickness ) , and adjusted the shape of the edge of the groove by trial and error using comsol s chamfer and fillet tools in order to achieve the necessary field profile .",
    "in doing so , the following competing factors were taken into consideration :    1 .",
    "if the rounding of the edge of the groove has too small a radius , then there will be a high field region between the rounded edge of the groove and the side wall of the pmma insert .",
    "whereas the surface of the electrode , including the rounded edge of the groove , forms an equipotential surface , there is a potential gradient along the surface of the pmma insert .",
    "therefore , the distance between the electrode surface and the pmma insert surface being too close at the location of the rounded edge of the groove causes the field there to be high . 2 .",
    "if the rounding of the edge of the groove has too large a radius , then the field at the bottom of the groove does not become sufficiently low .",

    "the system is further cooled by transferring lhe ( initially cold helium gas ) to the lhe bath . during this time",
    ", the cv is cooled by opening both mv1 and mv2 and flowing lhe ( initially cold helium gas ) from the lhe bath through the cv .",
    "the 1  k pot is also pumped on at the same time .",
    "as the cv is cooled sufficiently , the cv gets filled with lhe .",
    "it takes approximately 6  hours for the cv to become completely filled from the time when lhe starts to accumulate at the bottom of the cv .",
    "once the cv becomes completely filled with lhe , mv1 is closed . when the cv becomes full , the temperature of the cv is @xmath01.8  k. we also tried filling the ivc with helium gas as the exchange gas to cool the cv , instead of flowing cold helium gas through the cv .",
    "we found that flowing cold helium gas and lhe through the cv is a more efficient way of cooling it than using an exchange gas , because the use of exchange gas required spending time pumping out the exchange gas .",
    "the @xmath21he refrigerator is then turned on and the @xmath21he circulation starts .",
    "this further cools the cv .",
    "it takes approximately 4 hours to reach 0.4  k. overall , it takes @xmath02.5  days to go from the cv being empty at 300  k to the cv being filled with 0.4  k lhe .",
    "the temperature of the cv can easily be controlled either by adjusting the @xmath21he circulation or by using heaters that are mounted inside the cv ( directly in contact with lhe ) and on the outside wall of the cv .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "leaving mv2 open keeps the pressure of the lhe inside the cv at the pressure of the lhe inside the 4  k lhe bath , which is typically 600  torr .",
    "closing mv2 and pumping on the fill line to remove lhe from the fill line allows the pressure in the cv to be reduced",
    ". the pressure can be increased by stopping pumping on the fill line and opening mv2 momentarily .",
    "the pressure in the cv will be the svp of lhe at the location of the temperature of the liquid surface , which is somewhere on the fill line , along which there is a temperature gradient .",
    "the pressure can be changed and controlled with ease between @xmath01  torr and @xmath0600  torr with the method described above .",
    "going below @xmath01  torr can not be achieved efficiently by simply pumping on the fill line , because the vapor pressure of helium becomes smaller and smaller . however , lower pressures can be achieved by removing lhe from the fill line by first warming up the cv while pumping on the fill line and cooling it again .",
    "warming up the cv to higher temperatures makes it easy to remove lhe from the fill line because of the higher vapor pressure .",
    "note that the hydrostatic pressure of lhe is @xmath00.1  torr / cm .",
    "therefore even if the lhe surface is below the top of the cv , in which case the lowest pressure inside the cv is @xmath010@xmath49  torr , the pressure at the location of the electrodes is @xmath01  torr .",

    "in addition , the pressure change inside the cv can be monitored using the capacitance lhe level sensor mounted around the heat exchanger .",
