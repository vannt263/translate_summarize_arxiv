    "the site where r - process nuclei above a=90 have been synthesized remains a major unsolved problem in nucleosynthesis theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "historically , many possibilities have been proposed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but today , there are two principal contenders - neutron star mergers @xcite and the ndw @xcite",
    ". observations of ultra - metal - poor stars suggest that many r - process isotopes were already quite abundant at early times in the galaxy @xcite , suggesting both a primary origin for the r - process and an association with massive stars .",
    "ndws would have accompanied the first supernovae that made neutron stars and , depending upon what is assumed about their birth rate and orbital parameters , the first merging neutron stars could also have occurred quite early .",
    "both the merging neutron star model and the ndw have problems though . in the simplest version of galactic chemical evolution ,",
    "merging neutron stars might be capable of providing the necessary integrated yield of the r - process in the sun , but they make it too rarely in large doses and possibly too late to be consistent with observations @xcite . on the other hand , making the r - process in ndws",
    "requires higher entropies , shorter time - scales , or lower electron mole numbers , @xmath6 , than have been demonstrated in any realistic , modern model for a supernova explosion ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "previous papers and models for nucleosynthesis in the ndw have focused on the production of nuclei heavier than iron using either greatly simplified dynamics @xcite or nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "post processing nuclear network calculations have been performed using thermal histories from accurate models of the dynamics @xcite , but the calculations sampled only a limited set of trajectories in the ejecta .",
    "no one has yet combined the complete synthesis of a realistic ndw with that of the rest of the supernova .",
    "to address this situation , and to develop a framework for testing the nucleosynthesis of future explosion models , we have calculated nucleosynthesis using neutrino luminosity histories taken from two pns calculations found in the literature @xcite . this was done using a modified version of the implicit one - dimensional hydrodynamics code kepler , which includes an adaptive nuclear network of arbitrary size .",
    "this network allows for the production of both r - process nuclei during neutron - rich phases of the wind and production of light p - elements during proton - rich phases . since the results of wind nucleosynthesis",
    "depend sensitively on the neutrino luminosities and interaction rates @xcite , we have included accurate neutrino interaction rates that contain both general relativistic and weak magnetism corrections .",
    "the synthesis of all nuclei from carbon through lead is integrated over the history of the ndw and combined with the yield from the rest of the supernova , and the result is compared with a solar distribution .",
    "if a nucleus produced in the ndw is greatly overproduced relative to the yields of abundant elements in the rest of the supernova , there is a problem .",
    "if it is greatly underproduced , its synthesis in the ndw is unimportant .",
    "if it is co - produced , the ndw may be responsible for the galactic inventory of this element .",
    "an important outcome of this study are the yields expected from a `` plain vanilla '' model for the ndw .",
    "are there any elements that are robustly produced and thus might be used as diagnostics of the wind in an early generation of stars ?    in  [ wind_physics ]",
    ", we discuss the general physics of neutrino driven winds and analytically delineate the regions in neutrino temperature space were different modes of nucleosynthesis occur .",
    "we then discuss our numerical model in  [ computational_method ] . in  [ results ] , the results of the time dependent models are presented .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of how the ndw might affect galactic chemical evolution and consider if this allows the strontium abundance in low metallicity halo stars to be used as a tracer of supernova fallback at low metallicity .",
    "additionally , we investigate if observed abundances in sn 1987a can put constraints on late time neutrino luminosities from pnss .",
    "finally , we discuss some possible modifications of the basic model that might improve the r - process production . these ideas will be explored more thoroughly in a subsequent paper .",
    "after collapse and bounce in a core collapse supernova , a condition of near hydrostatic equilibrium exists in the vicinity of the neutrinospheres .",
    "the temperature of the outer layers is changing on a time scale determined by the kelvin - helmholtz time of the pns , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is much longer than the dynamical time scale of the pns envelope , so the hydrostatic part of the envelope is in an approximate steady state .",
    "the neutrino heating rate , which is determined by the neutrino luminosities from the neutrino sphere , must then balance the local neutrino cooling rate .",
    "heating and cooling are dominated by the charged current processes @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "equating these rates , while neglecting the neutron - proton mass difference and weak magnetism corrections and assuming the geometry can be approximated as close to plane - parallel gives the temperature structure of the neutron star atmosphere as a function of radius , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron neutrino luminosity and average neutrino energy at the neutrino sphere in units of @xmath13 and mev , respectively .",
    "the gravitational redshift factor is @xmath14 which , when evaluated at the neutrino sphere , @xmath15 , is @xmath16 .",
    "notice that the only dependence on radius is carried in the redshift factor , so that the atmosphere is close to isothermal .    at the radius , @xmath17 , where the pressure in the envelope becomes radiation dominated ,",
    "the material becomes unstable to outflow @xcite . since the neutrino luminosity is significantly lower than the neutrino eddington luminosity , a thermally driven wind results @xcite .",
    "the density at which this wind begins can be found approximately by equating the radiation pressure to the baryonic pressure .",
    "this results in a critical density , @xmath18 at which significant outflow begins and the kinetic equilibrium of weak interactions ceases to hold . under these conditions , nuclear statistical equilibrium",
    "is maintained on a time scale much shorter than the dynamical time scale and , for these temperatures and densities , there will be no bound nuclei present .",
    "since the electron fraction is set by kinetic equilibrium , the composition of the wind does not depend on any previous nuclear processing , so any nucleosynthesis from the wind will be primary .    assuming that most neutrino heating occurs near @xmath17 , the entropy is constant once the temperature cools to the nucleon recombination temperature , @xmath19 mev .",
    "therefore , the final nuclear abundances in the wind depend mainly on the wind entropy , electron fraction , and the dynamical timescale at the radius where alpha combination occurs @xcite . to determine the contribution of the wind to the nucleosynthesis of the entire supernova ,",
    "the mass loss rate must also be known .",
    "estimates for these quantities are given in the appendix along with a discussion of the effect of general relativistic corrections .",
    "integrating the mass loss rate ( equation [ eq : mdot ] ) for a typical neutrino luminosity history implies that the wind will eject approximately @xmath20 of material .",
    "this in turn means that for the wind to contribute to the integrated yields of the supernova for a particular isotope , that isotope needs to overproduced relative to its solar mass fraction by a factor of at least @xmath21 in the wind , assuming the rest of the supernova ejects @xmath22 and has over production factors of its most abundant metals of order 10 .    at early times in the wind ,",
    "the pns is losing lepton number ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "neutrino interactions in the wind then tend to increase the lepton number of the wind , and , to maintain charge neutrality , cause the wind to become proton rich . under these conditions ,",
    "the wind may synthesize some of the light p - process elements via the so called @xmath23p - process @xcite .        after the initial deleptonization burst though",
    ", the net lepton number carried by the wind will be small .",
    "since the anti - electron neutrinosphere sits deeper in the pns than the electron neutrinosphere , the electron neutrinos will be cooler than the electron anti - neutrinos @xcite .",
    "if this asymmetry is large enough , the wind can become neutron rich at later times . combined with an @xmath24-rich freeze out , this can give conditions favorable for the r - process @xcite .",
    "in both cases , the resulting nucleosynthesis is characterized by the integrated neutron to seed ratio after charged particle reactions freeze out . for proton - rich winds ,",
    "alpha - particles recombine into @xmath25c by the standard triple alpha reaction and then alpha - capture and proton - capture reactions carry the nuclear flow up to approximately mass 60 @xcite .",
    "the slowest reaction in this sequence is @xmath26he(@xmath27,@xmath28)@xmath25c , so the total number of seed nuclei produced is equal to the number of @xmath25c nuclei produced .",
    "when only free protons are present , the integrated neutron density is determined by the rate of anti - neutrino capture on free protons .",
    "an estimate for the neutron to seed ratio for proton - rich winds is given by equation [ eq : nsp ] .",
    "a neutron to seed ratio of only a few is required to bypass the few long - lived waiting points which hinder production of the light p - isotopes @xcite .",
    "still , it is challenging to produce even a small neutron to seed ratio , since the dynamical time scale of the wind is short compared to the anti - neutrino capture time scale .",
    "in the neutron - rich case , seed nuclei are produced by a different reaction sequence @xmath26he(@xmath24n,@xmath28)@xmath29be(@xmath24,n)@xmath25c @xcite .",
    "for the conditions encountered in the wind , the neutron catalyzed triple - alpha reaction proceeds about ten times as quickly as @xmath26he(@xmath27,@xmath28)@xmath25c .",
    "this increases the seed number compared with that obtained in a proton - rich wind with similar dynamical properties .",
    "also , since there are free neutrons , capture can proceed up to the n=50 closed shell isotopes @xmath2sr , @xmath3y , and @xmath4zr . here , the neutron density is just determined by the number of free neutrons left after charged particle reactions freeze out .",
    "the neutron to seed ratio in neutron - rich winds can be approximated using equation [ eq : nsn ] .",
    "charged particle reactions continue up to the n=50 closed shell , at which point it becomes unfavorable to capture alpha particles due to small separation energies and large coulomb barriers @xcite . if neutrons are exhausted during this process , the wind will mainly produce the isotopes @xmath2sr , @xmath3y , and @xmath4zr @xcite .",
    "this happens when the condition @xmath30 is met . here , @xmath31 is the fraction of the initial helium abundance that gets processed into heavy nuclei .",
    "neutron to seed ratios of approximately 30 and 110 are required to produce first and second peak r - process nucleosynthesis , respectively .    using the analytic results for the wind dynamics and nucleosynthesis given in the appendix ( equations [ eq : rcrit ] , [ eq : ent ] , [ eq : mdot ] , [ eq : tau],[eq : ye ]",
    ", [ eq : nsp ] , [ eq : nsn ] , and using the neutrino interaction rates given in  [ sec : neutrino_rates ] to fix the thermodynamic state at @xmath17 ) , one can easily explore the neutrino temperature parameter space to determine the neutrino temperatures and fluxes that are most conducive to the r - process or the production of the light p - process .",
    "figure [ fig : tcp_base ] is a neutrino two - color plot where it is assumed that the deleptonization rate is zero and that the neutrino luminosity scales with the temperature to the fourth power ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the different nucleosynthetic regions are delineated by the final calculated neutron to seed ratio . to give a feeling for how a particular point in parameter space might contribute to the integrated nucleosynthesis of the wind",
    ", the mass loss rate is also shown .    for a significant amount of material to move past the n = 50 closed shell during neutron - rich conditions",
    ", the anti - neutrino temperature must be approximately @xmath33% higher than the neutrino temperature . for second peak r - process nucleosynthesis to occur , the asymmetry must be greater than @xmath34% .",
    "modern pns cooling calculations do not give such large asymmetries @xcite .    under proton - rich conditions ,",
    "only a small region of the parameter space at high neutrino and low anti - neutrino temperature is favorable for the @xmath23p - process .",
    "there will be a small amount of neutron production in the white region , but it is unlikely that significant production of the light p - process elements @xmath35se , @xmath36kr , @xmath37sr , and @xmath38mo will occur .",
    "the region in neutrino temperature space where there is significant neutron production is unlikely to be reached .",
    "this region is small due to the short dynamical time scale of the wind , which reduces the time over which anti - neutrinos can capture on free neutrons .",
    "one should note that , very soon after shock formation in the supernova , a wind solution may not be appropriate and material will be entrained closer to the pns for a longer period of time .",
    "this scenario would be similar to the the conditions used in @xcite .",
    "therefore , based upon simple principles , it seems unlikely that the standard wind scenario will produce r - process or light p - process isotopes in solar ratios , as is required by observations of metal poor halo stars @xcite . this same conclusion has been reached by other authors @xcite , but is repeated here in simple terms .",
    "we will find that our numerical calculations give similar results and that there is no significant r - process nucleosynthesis associated with the wind .",
    "still , the wind can produce some isotopes that may have an observable signature . for standard pns luminosities , the wind will spend a significant amount of time in the region of parameter space were n = 50 closed shell nucleosynthesis occurs .",
    "to more accurately investigate the integrated nucleosynthesis of the ndw , we have updated the implicit lagrangian hydrodynamics code kepler @xcite to carry out time - dependent simulations of the wind dynamics and nucleosynthesis .",
    "kepler has been used previously to study time - independent winds@xcite , but the weak and nuclear physics employed there was rudimentary and nucleosynthesis was not tracked .",
    "trajectories from kepler were used for post - processing calculations of nucleosynthesis in @xcite .",
    "kepler solves the non - relativistic hydrodynamic equations in lagrangian coordinates assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "first order general relativistic corrections are included in the gravitational force law ( cf .",
    "all order @xmath39 effects are neglected .",
    "this is justified since the maximum wind speeds encountered are , at most , a few percent of the speed of light .",
    "the momentum equation is then @xmath40 where the symbols have their standard meanings .",
    "as has been shown by previous studies @xcite , general relativistic corrections to the gravitational force can have an appreciable effect on the entropy and dynamical time scale of the wind .",
    "the equation of state includes a boltzmann gas of nucleons and nuclei , an arbitrarily relativistic and degenerate ideal electron gas , and photons .",

    "standard neutrino capture rates are employed in the limit of infinitely heavy nucleons with first order corrections . in this limit , the cross section is ( y.z . qian , private communication ) @xmath41 \\left(\\epsilon_{\\nu } \\pm    \\delta \\right)^2\\left(1 \\pm w_{m , { \\nu \\atop { \\bar \\nu } } }    \\epsilon_{\\nu}\\right)\\ ] ] here , @xmath42 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath43 is the cabibo angle , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the dimensionless vector and axial - vector coupling constants for nucleons , @xmath46 is the proton neutron mass difference , @xmath47 is the neutrino energy , and @xmath48 accounts for the weak magnetism and recoil corrections to the neutrino - nucleon cross section when the base cross section is derived in the limit of infinitely heavy nucleons @xcite . this correction reduces the anti - neutrino cross section and increases the neutrino cross section ( by about a total of 10% at the energies encountered in ndws ) , which , for a given incident neutrino spectrum , significantly increases the asymptotic electron fraction . assuming a thermal distribution , these cross sections result in the neutrino energy deposition rate for anti - electron neutrino capture @xmath49 \\end{array}\\ ] ] and a similar expression for electron neutrino capture .",

    "a similar rate is employed for electron capture .    for the neutrino losses ,",
    "we include electron and positron capture on nucleons and include thermal losses as tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the energy loss rate in the wind is dominated by the electron captures .      during a hydrodynamic time step in kepler ,",
    "the nuclear energy generation rate and the changing nuclear composition are calculated using a modified version of the 19-isotope network described in @xcite .",
    "neutrino and electron capture rates on nucleons are coupled to the network , which are calculated under the same assumptions as the charged current energy deposition / loss rates described above . therefore , non - equilibrium evolution of the electron fraction is accurately tracked .",
    "although this network is appropriate for calculating energy generation throughout the entire wind , it is not large enough to accurately track the nucleosynthesis once alpha recombination begins at @xmath58 mev .",
    "therefore , for temperatures below @xmath59 an adaptive network is run alongside the hydrodynamics calculation .",
    "the details of this network can be found in @xcite and @xcite . as a fluid element passes the temperature threshold , the composition from the 19-isotope network",
    "is mapped into the adaptive network .",
    "typically , the network contains approximately 2000 isotopes .",
    "where available , experimental nuclear reaction rates are employed , but the vast majority of the rates employed in the network come from the statistical model calculations of @xcite . in general , the nuclear physics employed in these calculations is the same as that used in @xcite .",
    "the nucleon weak interaction rates employed in the 19-isotope network are also used in the adaptive network .      to start the neutrino driven wind problem , an atmosphere of mass 0.01 @xmath60 is allowed to relax to hydrostatic equilibrium on top of a fixed inner boundary at the neutron stars radius .",
    "the mass enclosed by the inner boundary is the neutron star s mass .",
    "the photon luminosity from the neutron star is assumed to be nearly eddington , but we have found that the properties of the wind are insensitive to the the luminosity boundary condition .",
    "once hydrostatic equilibrium is achieved , the neutrino flux is turned on and a thermal wind forms .",
    "this wind is allowed to relax to a quasi - steady state , and then the 19 isotope network is turned on and the wind is , once again , allowed to reach a quasi - steady state .",
    "after this point , the neutrino flux is allowed to vary with time , and the adaptive network is turned on .    as the calculation proceeds , the mass of the envelope being followed decreases and could eventually all be blown away . to prevent this",
    ", mass is added back to the innermost mass elements at a rate equal to the mass loss rate in the wind .",
    "the mass added to a fluid element at each time step is a small fraction of its total mass .",
    "we find that mass recycling has no effect on the properties of the wind .",
    "it is simply a way of treating a problem that is essentially eulerian in a lagrangian code .    for most runs",
    ", a zero outer boundary pressure and temperature are assumed . to investigate the effect of a wind termination shock , a time dependent outer boundary condition",
    "is included in some of the simulations detailed below .",
    "the pressure of the radiation dominated region behind the supernova shock is approximately given by @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the explosion energy of the supernova , @xmath63 is the supernova shock velocity , and @xmath64 is the time elapsed since the shock was launched . as was discussed in @xcite , this results in a wind termination shock at a radius where the condition @xmath65 obtains , where @xmath66 is the wind velocity and @xmath67 is the wind density . to avoid an accumulation of too many zones ,",

    "the neutrino luminosities and average energies as a function of time from this model are shown in figure [ fig : woos94_neut ] .",
    "after about 4 seconds , the neutrino energies become constant and the large difference between the electron neutrino and anti - neutrino energies implies that the wind will be neutron rich .",

    "the time evolution of the wind as calculated by kepler is shown in figure [ fig : woos94_wndprop ] . the increase in asymptotic entropy",
    "is mainly driven by the decrease in neutrino luminosity , since the average neutrino energies do not vary greatly . the analytic approximation ( calculated using equation [ eq : ent ] and the neutrino interaction rates given in ",
    "[ sec : neutrino_rates ] ) to the entropy tracks the entropy calculated in kepler fairly well .",
    "this implies that the variation in the neutrino luminosity with time does not significantly alter the dynamics from a steady state wind .",
    "in contrast to the high entropies reported in @xcite , the entropy here never exceeds 130 . for the time scales and electron fractions also obtained , such a low value of entropy is not sufficient to give a strong r - process ( see below ) .",

    "a larger explosion energy would likely result in a larger effect on the nucleosynthesis , but there are still very few neutrons available to bypass the long lived waiting points and it seems unlikely that the production factors would be increased by more than a factor of a few .",
    "since the progenitor model used in @xcite was a model for sn 1987a , it is interesting to compare our predicted abundances with those observed in the ejecta of that event .",
    "@xmath2sr , produced by the ndw , dominates the elemental strontium yield when the results of the 20 @xmath60 wind model are combined with those predicted by @xcite , who ignored the wind . for the base ndw model , [ sr / fe]@xmath118 , if weak magnetism corrections are neglected , [ sr / fe]@xmath119 ; and if the anti - neutrino temperature is reduced in the base model by 15% , [ sr / fe]@xmath120 .    @xcite found [ sr / fe]@xmath121 in the ejecta of sn 1987a 2 - 3 weeks after the explosion",
    "this observation has a substantial error bar due to the uncertainty of modelling the spectrum of the expanding ejecta .",
    "of even greater concern is comparing of our models for bulk yields with supernova photospheric abundances observed on a given day when the observations are probably not even probing the innermost ejecta .",
    "still , if one assumes that the [ sr / fe ] ratio found by @xcite represents the value for all of the ejecta ( for instance by assuming that `` mixing '' was extremely efficient ) , a weak constraint can be put on the neutrino fluxes and energies predicted by the model of @xcite . the ndw model with a reduced anti - neutrino temperature is much closer to the observed value of [ sr / fe ] than the other two models .",
    "this suggests the anti - neutrino temperature may have been overestimated in the original model , a change that would be more consistent with more modern calculations of neutrino spectra formation in pns atmospheres @xcite .",
    "but obviously , a meaningful constraint will require a more complete modeling of the multi - dimensional explosion and time - dependent spectrum of sn 1987a .",
    "since strontium and yttrium are abundantly produced in our models , it may be that the ndw has contributed to their production throughout cosmic history .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the abundances of these elements might trace the birth rate of neutron stars at an early time .",
    "taking a standard r - process abundance pattern from metal poor stars with strong r - process enhancments , @xcite find that 8% and 18% of solar strontium and yttrium , respectively , are not produced by either the `` standard '' r - process or any component of the s - process .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that charged particle reactions in the ndw could make up this `` missing '' component .",
    "any nucleosynthesis that happens in the ndw will be primary , i.e. provided that the mass function of neutron stars at birth does not itself scale with metallicity , similar nucleosynthesis will occur for stars of any population .",
    "below [ fe / h]@xmath122 , no component of the s - process contributes to the abundances of n = 50 closed shell isotopes @xcite .",
    "if the ndw escapes the potential well of the pns , and contributes to the galactic budget of n = 50 closed shell isotopes , it should provide a floor to [ sr / fe ] and [ y / fe ] . based upon the arguments of @xcite",
    ", this floor would be at [ sr / fe]@xmath123 and [ y / fe]@xmath124 .",
    "these numbers assume that when the main r - process source contributes in addition to the ndw , [ sr / fe ] and [ y / fe ] approach their solar values even though the s - process has yet to contribute .",
    "this is consistent with observations .    in defining this floor",
    ", one must assume that the abundances in a particular star sample a large number of individual supernovae .",
    "this is because the production of n=50 closed shell elements likely depends on the pns mass and therefore the progenitor mass .",
    "as we have found , [ sr / fe]@xmath125 in the @xmath69 model with reduced anti - neutrino temperatures , but the @xmath70 model produces no strontium .",
    "observations show that below [ fe / h]@xmath126 , the spreads in [ sr / fe ] and [ y / fe ] increase significantly and the mean values falloff some @xcite .",
    "single stars have values of [ sr / fe ] below the predicted floor .",
    "this could be because , at this metallicity , the metals in a particular star come from only a handful of supernovae .",
    "another possible explanation of this variation is that supernova fall back varies with metallicity .",
    "since the ndw is the innermost portion of the supernova ejecta , it will be the most susceptible to fallback .",
    "it has been found that the amount of supernova fallback depends strongly on the metallicity of the progenitor , especially going between zero and low metallicity @xcite .",
    "additionally , mixing is also greatly reduced in zero metallicity stars compared to solar metallicity stars due to the formers compact structure @xcite .",
    "the current understanding of supernova fallback suggests that the nucleosynthetic contribution of the ndw will be suppressed at very low metallicity .",
    "of course , the ejection of iron by the supernova is also very susceptible to fallback , so the effect of fallback on the evolution of [ sr , y / fe ] is complicated and may require fine tuning to give the observed decrease .",
    "a somewhat different explanation was offered by @xcite who attributed the fall off of [ sr / fe ] at low metallicity to the evolution of the `` hypernova '' rate with metallicity . for their purposes , hypernovae were stellar explosions that contributed iron without making much strontium .    given the sensitivity of strontium and yttrium yields to uncertain ndw characteristics , especially neutrino fluxes and temperatures , it may be some time before the complex history of these elements is even qualitatively understood .",
    "it is likely though that their abundances in halo stars will ultimately be powerful constraints upon the evolution of supernova physics as a function of metallicity .      as is clear from figures [ fig : wwsolopf ] and",
    "[ fig : jnkpf ] , the simplest case of a non - magnetic non - rotating ndw from a neutron star without additional energy deposition does not produce r - process nuclei in significant abundances . are there extensions to this simple scenario that",
    "_ could _ make the wind a site of the r - process ?    as was pointed out by @xcite , the combination of rotation and magnetic fields can decrease the dynamical time scale by magnetic `` flinging '' .",
    "this is not particularly effective .",
    "adding a non - thermal source of kinetic energy means that less thermal energy must be put into the wind for it to escape the potential well .",
    "therefore , lower entropies are achieved .",
    "it seems unlikely that this mechanism , by itself , will salvage the ndw as a site for the full r - process .",
    "if there were a way to make the rotation rate of the pns high enough , it might be possible that there would be a centrifugally driven outflow . then the electron fraction would be determined by kinetic equilibrium much deeper in the pns envelope , and the material in the outflow would have an electron fraction much lower than that seen in the wind .    to test this possibility , we ran calculations with a centrifugal force term added and corotation with the pns enforced out to @xmath127 km",
    ". unfortunately , for reasonable pns spin rates ( 20 ms period ) , we found this had little effect on the nucleosynthesis .",
    "these calculations were in a regime were the electron fraction was still set by neutrino interactions .",
    "many authors have discussed the possible effects of both matter - enhanced@xcite and collective neutrino @xcite oscillations on ndw nucleosynthesis .",
    "if electron antineutrinos could undergo a collective oscillation near the launch radius while the electron neutrinos did not , this would increase the average energy of the antineutrinos if the @xmath128 and @xmath129 neutrinos have a significantly higher temperature , facilitating a reduction in the electron fraction .",
    "for a normal mass hierarchy however , matter enhanced neutrino oscillations would probably cause electron neutrino flavor conversion , which would _ increase _ the electron fraction and decrease the probability of significant r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "collective neutrino oscillations can cause antineutrino oscillations in the region were the electron fraction is set , and thereby decrease the electron fraction where pure msw oscillations would have predicted an increased electron fraction@xcite .",
    "clearly , the main effect of oscillations would be on the composition of the wind , not the dynamics .",
    "as can be seen in the neutrino two color plots , oscillations would have to change the effective temperature of the anti - neutrinos by a very large amount to move from a region where n=50 close shell nucleosynthesis occurs to a region where the second r - process peak can be produced .",
    "these effects are based upon the assumption that @xmath128- and @xmath129-neutrinos are significantly more energetic than the electron neutrinos . in the calculation of @xcite ,",
    "this is the case , as can be seen in figure [ fig : woos94_neut ] .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath128 and @xmath129 temperatures are almost the same as the electron anti - neutrino temperature in the @xcite calculation , which can be seen in figure [ fig : jnk_neut ] .",
    "it is not clear wether this difference obtains because of the difference in the pns masses or the significantly different neutrino physics employed in the calculations .",
    "a detailed study of neutrino transport in static backgrounds showed that the inclusion of all relevant neutrino interactions brings the average energies of the @xmath128- and @xmath129- neutrinos closer to the temperature of the anti - electron neutrinos @xcite .",
    "therefore it is uncertain wether or not neutrino oscillations could effect nucleosynthesis significantly .",
    "clearly , the uncertainties here are not in the wind itself but in the formation of the spectra in the pns and the details of neutrino transport with neutrino oscillations .",
    "finally , it has been suggested @xcite that adding a secondary source of volumetric energy deposition can significantly increase the entropy of the wind , which results in a more alpha - rich freeze out and conditions that would be more favorable for r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the addition of energy to the wind also decreases the dynamical timescale .",
    "since the important quantity to consider for the r - process is @xmath130 @xcite , both effects increase the chance of having a significant neutron to seed ratio after freeze out .",
    "if the ndw model is to be salvaged , this seems to us the minimal necessary extension .",
    "of course , the physical process contributing this extra energy is very uncertain .",
    "one possibility is that oscillations of the pns power sound waves which produce shocks and deposit energy in the wind , similar to the supernova mechanism of @xcite , but smaller in magnitude .",
    "we will explore this possibility in some detain in a subsequent paper .    from a chemical evolution standpoint ,",
    "it is important to consider what effect neutron star mergers will have on the evolution of the r - process abundances .",
    "it seems unavoidable that r - process nuclei will be produced in the tidal tails ejected during these mergers @xcite and the amount of material ejected in these events is approximately enough to account for the galactic inventory of r - process elements given the expected merger rate @xcite .",
    "neutron star mergers have been largely discounted because inferred merger rates are small at low metallicity due to the long in spiral time and therefore they can not account for the r - process enrichment seen in low metallicity halo stars @xcite .",
    "of course , the inferred merger rates are very uncertain as are models for the early evolution of the milky way , so that both the conclusion that neutron star mergers can account for the r - process inventory of the galaxy and that they are not consistent with producing the r - process at low metallicity are very uncertain .",
    "clearly , there is significant room for more work in this area .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable that the galactic r - process abundances could be accounted for by a combination of mergers and winds with an extra source of energy , either from an acoustically and/or magnetically active pns . since not",
    "every supernova will have the requisite conditions for an r - process , there will be significant variation in the yields from single supernovae .",
    "this , along with the contribution from neutron star mergers , will give significant variation in the [ r - process/@xmath24-element ] values found in single stars at low metallicity but averaged over many stars these should track one another , which is consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "we have performed calculations of the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in time dependent neutrino driven winds .",
    "this was done for two sets of neutrino spectra calculated in one - dimensional supernova models taken from the literature .",
    "the nucleosynthesis in these models was compared with supernova yields to determine if these models were consistent with observations . additionally , we compared the results of these numerical models to analytic models of the neutrino driven wind and found good agreement .",
    "similar to most of the work on the ndw after @xcite , we find that it is unlikely that the r - process occurs in the neutrino driven wind unless there is something that causes significant deviation from a purely neutrino driven wind . additionally , in the simplest case , there is little production of p - process elements at early times in the wind . in our calculation that used spectra from a more massive neutron star ,",
    "the wind only produces the n=50 closed shell elements @xmath1rb , @xmath2sr , @xmath3y , and @xmath4zr .",

    "the over abundance of strontium seen in sn 1987a suggests that the difference between the electron and anti - electron neutrino temperatures in the model of @xcite may have been to large .",
    "we also find that the effect of a wind termination shock on the wind nucleosynthesis is small .",
    "using neutrino spectra from an @xmath70 supernova that drives a wind which is proton rich throughout its duration @xcite , we find that no significant @xmath23p - process occurs and the wind does not contribute to the yields of the supernova .",

    "we also investigated the effect of an outer boundary pressure which resulted in a wind termination shock .",
