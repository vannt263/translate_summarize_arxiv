    "<S> the bosonic two - loop electroweak radiative corrections to the muon s anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath0 , are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath1 for @xmath2 gev . combining that result with our previous two - loop fermionic calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an overall 22.6% reduction in @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> implications for the full standard model prediction and an upcoming high precision measurement of @xmath6 are briefly discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also give the two - loop electroweak corrections to the anomalous magnetic moments of electron and tau lepton ; they result in a reduction of the one - loop estimates by 35% and 15% , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath0 , provides both a sensitive quantum loop test of the standard @xmath7 model and a window to potential `` new physics '' effects . </S>",
    "<S> the current experimental average @xcite @xmath8 is in good agreement with theoretical expectations and already constrains physics beyond the standard model such as supersymmetry and supergravity @xcite , dynamical or loop muon mass generation @xcite , compositeness @xcite , leptoquarks @xcite etc .    </S>",
    "<S> an upcoming experiment e821 @xcite at brookhaven national laboratory is expected to start in 1996 . with one month of dedicated running </S>",
    "<S> , it is expected to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath9 to roughly @xmath10 , more than a factor of 20 improvement . with subsequent </S>",
    "<S> longer dedicated runs it could statistically approach the anticipated systematic uncertainty of about @xmath11 @xcite . at those levels , </S>",
    "<S> both electroweak one and two loop effects become important and `` new physics '' at the multi - tev scale is probed . indeed , generic muon mass generating mechanisms ( via perturbative or dynamical loops @xcite ) lead to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scale of `` new physics '' . at @xmath10 sensitivity , @xmath14 tev is being explored .    to fully exploit the anticipated experimental improvement </S>",
    "<S> , the standard model prediction for @xmath6 must be known with comparable precision . that requires detailed studies of very high order qed loops , hadronic effects , and electroweak contributions through two loop order . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions to @xmath6 are traditionally divided into @xmath15 qed loops have been computed to very high order @xcite @xmath16 employing @xmath17 obtained from the electron @xmath18 , implies @xcite @xmath19 the uncertainty is well within the @xmath20 goal . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , even if we take the last known term in ( [ eq : qed ] ) as indicative of its truncation uncertainty , the qed error remains relatively small .    </S>",
    "<S> hadronic vacuum polarization corrections to @xmath6 enter at @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> they can be evaluated via a dispersion relation using @xmath22 data and perturbative qcd ( for the very high energy regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> employing a recent analysis of @xmath23 data @xcite along with an estimate of the leading @xmath24 effects , we find @xcite @xmath25 unfortunately , the error has not yet reached the desired level of precision . </S>",
    "<S> ongoing improvements in @xmath22 measurements at low energies along with additional theoretical input should significantly lower the uncertainty in ( [ eq : hadr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , reducing the hadronic error below @xmath26 or even @xmath27 remains a formidable challenge .    </S>",
    "<S> the result in ( [ eq : hadr ] ) must be supplemented by hadronic light by light amplitudes ( which are of three loop origin ) @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we employ a recently updated study by hayakawa , kinoshita , and sanda @xcite which gives @xmath28 however , we note that the result is somewhat dependent on the low energy model of hadronic physics employed and continues to be scrutinized . combining ( [ eq : hadr ] ) and ( [ eq : light ] ) leads to the total hadronic contribution @xmath29    now we come to the electroweak contributions to @xmath6 , the main focus of our work and the impetus for forthcoming experimental effort . at the one loop level , </S>",
    "<S> the standard model predicts @xcite @xmath30 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\approx 195 \\times 10^{-11 } \\label{eq : oneloop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 gev@xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 , and the weak mixing angle @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we can safely neglect the @xmath36 terms in ( [ eq : oneloop ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the one loop result in ( [ eq : oneloop ] ) is about five to ten times the anticipated experimental error . </S>",
    "<S> naively , one might expect higher order ( 2 loop ) electroweak contributions to be of relative @xmath37 and hence negligible ; however , that is not the case . </S>",
    "<S> kukhto , kuraev , schiller , and silagadze ( kkss ) @xcite have shown that some two loop electroweak contributions can be quite large and must be included in any serious theoretical estimate of @xmath3 or future confrontation with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> given the kkss observation , a detailed evaluation of the two loop electroweak contributions to @xmath6 is clearly warranted . </S>",
    "<S> here , we report the complete results of such an analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the two loop electroweak contributions to @xmath3 naturally divide into so - called fermion and boson parts @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath39 includes all two loop electroweak corrections which contain closed fermion loops while all other contributions are lumped into @xmath40 . in a previous study @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we computed @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath41 250 gev it reduces @xmath3 by 11.8% . </S>",
    "<S> we have now completed that effort by computing @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are described below .    </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop diagrams which contribute to the lowest order electroweak corrections to @xmath6 are shown in fig .  1 ( there is another diagram obtained by exchanging @xmath42 and @xmath43 in 1(c ) but its value is the same as 1(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is true also for mirror reflections of two loop diagrams , and hence we do not depict them . ) the diagrams of fig .  1 , minus schwinger s photon exchange diagram in 1(a ) , lead to the formula ( [ eq : oneloop ] ) </S>",
    "<S> .    the two - loop diagrams fall in two general categories . </S>",
    "<S> the first and largest group consists of all diagrams which can be viewed as corrections to the one - loop diagrams in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> those are one - loop insertions in the propagators and vertices , but also non - planar diagrams and diagrams with quartic couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the second group includes all the new types which appear at the two - loop level , as shown in fig .  2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the complete set of all two - loop diagrams is quite large , together with fermionic loops it includes the total of 1678 diagrams @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the diagrams with two or more scalar couplings to the muon line are suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath44 and can be discarded . </S>",
    "<S> this is true already at the one - loop level , where one neglects the diagrams with the higgs boson loop and with two goldstone boson couplings to the muon . </S>",
    "<S> making this approximation and taking advantage of the mirror symmetry mentioned above reduces the number of relevant diagrams to about 240 in the linear t  hooft - feynman gauge . </S>",
    "<S> this number can be almost halved by choosing a non - linear gauge @xcite in which the @xmath45 vertex vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> we performed the calculation in both gauges to have a sensitive check of the accuracy of our procedures . </S>",
    "<S> for both gauges , two loop divergences are canceled by counterterm insertions in the one loop diagrams of fig .  1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the smallness of the muon mass compared to the electroweak scales allows us to employ the asymptotic expansion method @xcite . in the present calculation </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that mass of the higgs is large compared to @xmath46 and compute the first two terms in the expansion in @xmath47 . in diagrams where both @xmath42 and @xmath48 bosons are present </S>",
    "<S> we also expand in their relative mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an expansion in @xmath49 and we keep the first four terms in this expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this number of powers is also sufficient to obtain an exact coefficient of the large logarithms @xmath50 ; these terms are generated by diagrams with either @xmath48 or @xmath42 boson and hence their coefficient is a polynomial , rather than a series , in @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> the large logs have been considered by kkss @xcite in the approximation @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a slightly different coefficient even in this special case . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between kkss and our calculation is that kkss did not consider the diagram shown in fig .  3 , where a contribution to the leading log comes from a loop with the higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> there is no higgs mass suppression in this diagram because of the @xmath52 coupling . without this diagram </S>",
    "<S> the result is gauge dependent . </S>",
    "<S> for example , this diagram vanishes exactly in the non - linear gauge we adopted in the cross - check , but not in the linear gauge . </S>",
    "<S> it should , therefore , have been included in the linear gauge calculation as in kkss .    </S>",
    "<S> altogether , we find for the two - loop electroweak corrections @xmath53 + { \\cal o}(s_w^6 ) \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath54    and @xmath55 we have used the mass shell renormalization prescription @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> part of the two - loop bosonic corrections have been absorbed into the lowest order result , by expressing one - loop contributions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : oneloop ] ) in terms of the muon decay constant @xmath56 .    employing @xmath57 and @xmath58 gev in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : result],[eq : oneloop ] ) gives @xmath59 which corresponds to a 11.0% reduction . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the partial leading log calculation of kkss gave @xmath60 , a 10.3% reduction .    </S>",
    "<S> combining our new result and previous fermionic two - loop calculation leads to a total reduction of @xmath3 by a factor @xmath61 and the new electroweak prediction @xmath62 the assigned error of @xmath63 is due to uncertainties in @xmath64 and quark two loop effects . </S>",
    "<S> it also allows for possible three loop ( or higher ) electroweak contributions . in that regard </S>",
    "<S> , we note that our calculation of the @xmath65 coefficients can be combined with a renormalization group analysis to sum up leading log corrections of the form @xmath66 , @xmath67 ; that analysis will be given in a future publication .    </S>",
    "<S> with minor modifications , our results give also the two - loop electroweak corrections to anomalous magnetic moments of other leptons . </S>",
    "<S> for the electron we find for the combined fermionic and bosonic loops @xmath68 the two - loop corrections result in a 35% reduction of the one - loop prediction .    </S>",
    "<S> for the tau lepton the total result of two - loop bosonic and fermionic loops is @xmath69 the fermionic contribution has been computed assuming charm quark mass equal approximately to the tau mass . in the case of the @xmath70-lepton the two - loop corrections amount to a 15% reduction of the one - loop result .    </S>",
    "<S> our final result in ( [ eq : newaew ] ) along with the current best estimates for @xmath71 and @xmath72 are illustrated in table i. for comparison , the 1990 values are also given @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> changes reflect the evolution and continuing scrutiny of theoretical studies . at present @xmath73 with extremely small qed and ew uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> what remains is to reduce the hadronic uncertainty by a factor of 4 ( or more ) via improved @xmath74 data and additional theoretical input . </S>",
    "<S> then , one can fully exploit the anticipated improvement in @xmath9 from e821 at brookhaven , a measurement we anxiously await . </S>"
