    "therefore , in low energy and strong coupling limit , their dynamics can be analyzed by means of eleven dimensional supergravity without informations of its microscopic physics .",
    "the manifolds which express the d6-brane ( d6 ) and the orientifold 6-plane ( o6 ) are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively@xcite , where @xmath3 is taub - nut manifold , @xmath4 is atiyah - hitchin manifold@xcite and @xmath5 is the @xmath0-dimensional flat minkowski space .",
    "the d6-brane lying on the orientifold 6-plane ( o6+d6 ) corresponds to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is covering space of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the propagations of the gravitational wave or the d - particle on d6 , o6 or o6+d6 backgrounds in type iia theory with strong coupling .",
    "we calculate the potential between a 6-plane and a d - particle and reproduce the known result . in the case of the o6 or the o6+d6 background",
    ", we find the process in which gravitational wave colliding with the fixed plane convert into a d - particle . for eigenstates of orbital angular momentum",
    ", we calculate the transition amplitude of this process numerically in the simplest case . as a result",
    ", we obtain the amplitude of order one .",
    "the manifolds @xmath9 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 have some common properties ( @xmath10 is eguchi - hanson manifold , which is not used in this paper ) .",
    "namely , they are hyper khler manifolds with @xmath8 ( or @xmath11 ) isometry .",
    "such manifolds are studied in detail in @xcite and metrics of these manifolds are given explicitly . in this section ,",
    "we review the properties of these manifolds which are necessary in the later sections .",

    "* in the high energy limit ( @xmath119 ) , the wave propagation is described by geodesic orbits of a classical particle .",
    "therefore , the amplitude is independent of the wavelength and it approaches to a constant . * because the wave equation ( [ waveeq ] ) for o6 and that for o6+d6 are identical , we have @xmath120 where eqs.([r11is ] ) and ( [ ndis ] ) have been used .",
    "* because the non - zero elements of the matrix @xmath121 in eq.([waveeq ] ) are only @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the change of @xmath77 is restricted to an even integer . using ( [ ndis ] ) , we get a selection rule for the d - particle number .",
