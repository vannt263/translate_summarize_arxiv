    "the shell - type supernova remnant g266.2@xmath01.2  was discovered in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey data and , based upon its equatorial coordinates , named rx  j0852.0@xmath04622 @xcite .",
    "it lies along the same line of sight as the vela supernova remnant , which is considerably brighter than g266.2@xmath01.2(vela - z ) at radio frequencies @xcite and at x - ray energies below 1  kev @xcite . for these reasons , it is not surprising that g266.2@xmath01.2  ( aka `` vela jr . '' ) was only recently identified as a separate object.1.2  may not be a separate object , but is instead part of the vela supernova remnant , produced by a fast - moving ejecta clump that has interacted with the shell . here , we assume that g266.2@xmath01.2  and vela are separate objects because the spectral properties of g266.2@xmath01.2  and the vela ejecta clumps `` a '' and `` d '' are not the same . features `` a '' @xcite and `` d '' @xcite exhibit thermal x - ray spectra , while x - ray spectra of g266.2@xmath01.2  seem to be entirely nonthermal . furthermore , g266.2@xmath01.2  is a source of tev gamma rays , and at least feature `` d '' is not ( * ? ? ?",

    "]    the remnant is nearly circular with a relatively large angular radius of about 0.9@xmath7 .",
    "it has relatively low radio @xcite and x - ray surface brightnesses .",
    "to the extent that it is possible to distinguish the emission of g266.2@xmath01.2  from the emission of vela , the x - ray @xcite and radio spectra of g266.2@xmath01.2  appear to be dominated by synchrotron radiation ( or , perhaps , jitter radiation , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from tev and gev electrons , respectively .",

    "@xcite and @xcite report the detection of g266.2@xmath01.2  in gev gamma rays .",
    "however , images at this energy differ somewhat from the tev gamma - ray , x - ray , and radio images , perhaps due to a spatially unresolved ( at gev energies ) combination of emission from g266.2@xmath01.2and from the pulsar wind nebula of psr  j0855@xmath04644 .",
    "the 64.7  ms radio pulsar psr  j0855@xmath04644 @xcite , which lies near the southeastern rim of g266.2@xmath01.2 , is associated with an x - ray  emitting @xcite and , perhaps , gamma - ray ",

    "however , @xcite argue that the idea that psr  j0855@xmath04644 and g266.2@xmath01.2  are associated with each other @xcite is unlikely because the space velocity of the pulsar would have to be unusually high and because there is no evidence of a bow shock or a trail around it .",

    "] the lack of evidence of r band emission from cxou  j085201.4461753 , down to a limiting magnitude of about 25.6 @xcite , suggests that it was produced by the collapse of a massive star @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence of x - ray pulsations @xcite or of a known radio pulsar at this location .",
    "the object does lie in or near a 6  arcsec - diameter optically - emitting nebula @xcite , at least on the plane of the sky , but it is not clear that the detected optical ( h@xmath12 or [ n ] ) source and the x - ray source are the same object @xcite .",

    "we used the _ chandra _",

    "constraints on the age and distance of the remnant are discussed in  [ dis ] .",
    "the conclusions are presented in  [ concl ] .",
    "the northwestern region of g266.2@xmath01.2  was observed with _",
    "chandra _ in 2003 @xcite and 2008 ( table  [ tab01 ] ) .",
    "the data for these observations were reprocessed with version 4.6 of the ciao suite of analysis tools and with version 4.6.1.1 of the caldb to use the most recent data reduction algorithms and calibration products .",
    "this process involved the following steps , in sequence .",
    "the level 1 event - data status bits 15 and 1423 ( of 031 ) were unset .",
    "the tool destreak was used to identify events associated with horizontal streaks ( electronic noise ) on the acis - s4 ccd .",
    "the tools acis_build_badpix ( first execution ) , acis_find_afterglow , and acis_build_badpix ( second execution ) were used to produce new observation - specific bad - pixel files .",
    "note that the tool acis_find_afterglow includes the most recent cosmic - ray afterglow and hot - pixel identification algorithms .",
    "the tool acis_process_events was used to apply the new bad - pixel files , to update the computation of the celestial coordinates , to update the pulse - height information ( i.e.  the charge - transfer inefficiency ( cti ) and time - dependent gain adjustments ) , and to set certain status bits .",
    "the tool dmcopy was used to exclude events that are not in the good - time intervals , that have a bad grade ( 1 , 5 , or 7 ) , that have one or more status bits set to one ( e.g.  occur on bad pixels or that are part of an afterglow or horizontal acis - s4 streak ) , or that have an energy outside the range from 15  kev . the data at energies less than 1  kev were discarded because they are dominated by emission from the foreground vela supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "the data at energies greater than or equal to 5  kev were discarded because they are dominated by a charged - particle background .",
    "there is no evidence of significant problems with the bias maps or of flares in the particle background .",
    "the focal - plane temperature remained within @xmath13 of the nominal temperature of @xmath14 .",
    "figures  [ fig01 ] and [ fig02 ] are images of the 15  kev photon fluxes incident on the _ chandra _  telescope ( i.e.  the absorbed fluxes ) in 2003 and 2008 , respectively .",
    "these images were produced using the following ciao tools in sequence : reproject_events ( to place the data for obs_ids 4414 and 9123 on the same celestial tangent plane as the data for obs_id 3846 ) , asphist , mkinstmap ( with spectral weights from the spectrum of the brightest portion of the region that was observed in both epochs ) , mkexpmap , dmcopy , and dmimgcalc .",
    "the point - spread function of the _ chandra _  mirrors and acis varies over the observed portion of g266.2@xmath01.2 . at the aim point ,",
    "50% of the events fall within a radius of about @xmath15 . for a region that is @xmath16 off axis",
    ", this radius is about @xmath17 .",
    "version 6.11 of the ftool fgauss was used to smooth the images with a two - dimensional gaussian function where @xmath18  arcsec .",
    "this choice of gaussian widths yields images that have comparable spatial resolutions in the regions that were used to measure the rate of expansion .",
    "while the procedure used to create figures  1 and 2 removed most of the instrumental features , some residual artifacts remain , particularly between ccds and along the outer edges of the detectors .",
    "the images were searched for potential registration sources .",
    "the two sources listed in table  [ tab02 ] and shown in figures  [ fig01 ] and [ fig02 ] , while faint , are point - like , are present in both the 2003 and 2008 datasets , seem to be spatially coincident with sources in the _",
    "2mass _ and usno - b1.0 catalogs , and , at least for the 2003 observation , are moderately close to the optical axis of _ chandra_. these criteria give us some confidence that the sources are not associated with diffuse emission from the remnant .",
    "the _ chandra_coordinates listed in table  [ tab02 ] were computed for each source at each epoch as follows .",
    "a bin size in the range from 0.3 to 2.0 pixels ( i.e.  0.15 to 0.98  arcsec ) was chosen . the events located within a @xmath19 square grid centered on the _",
    "2mass _  coordinates of the source were selected .",
    "a one - dimensional , 60-bin histogram of these events was created along the @xmath20 axis ( i.e.  right ascension ) and fitted with a model that includes a constant component for the background and a gaussian component for the source .",
    "the four parameters for this model were allowed to vary .",
    "a similar histogram was created along the @xmath21 axis ( i.e.  declination ) and a similar fit was performed .",
    "this process was repeated for many bin sizes .",
    "while the results at all bin sizes are consistent with the results in table  [ tab02 ] , in general the results seem most reliable for bin sizes between about 0.5 and 1.0  pixels .",
    "therefore , the coordinates in this table are the mean values of the results obtained for bin sizes in this narrower range .",
    "the _ chandra _  and usno - b1.0 coordinates are plotted relative to the _ 2mass_coordinates in the four panels of figure  [ fig03 ] .",
    "since the _ 2mass_coordinates are used for reference here , they are plotted at the centers of the four panels .",
    "the lengths of the horizontal and vertical bars for each data point correspond to the 90% confidence level intervals in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath22 in each panel of the figure denotes the angle between the optical axis of the _ chandra_telescope and the _ 2mass _  coordinates of the source .",
    "the wide range of these angles ( 0.90 to 6.15 arcmin ) , suggests that the _ chandra _  coordinates are affected to varying degrees by asymmetries in the off - axis point - spread function of the telescope .",
    "_ marx _ simulations were used to investigate this effect . about @xmath23 simulated x - rays",
    "were produced for each source at each epoch assuming that the sources are at the locations given by the _",
    "2mass _  coordinates .",
    "a subset of the simulated events were used to calculate the coordinates in the manner described above .",
    "the number of events in each subset is consistent with the number of events in the _ chandra _  data .",
    "ten thousand subsets were processed for each one of the four cases ( i.e.  each one of the four panels in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "the horizontal and vertical bars of the blue data points in figure  [ fig03 ] represent the intervals over which 90% of the simulated right ascension and declination coordinates , respectively , are found .",
    "as shown , the simulated locations of the _ 2mass _  sources are consistent with the actual _ 2mass _  locations .",
    "therefore , asymmetries in the off - axis point - spread function of the _ chandra _  telescope are not expected to significantly affect the accuracy of the _ chandra _  coordinates of the registration sources . from table",
    "[ tab02 ] , the differences between the _ chandra _  coordinates of the registration sources in 2003 and the _ 2mass_coordinates of the sources are @xmath24  arcsec and @xmath25  arcsec . in 2008 , the differences are @xmath26  arcsec and @xmath27  arcsec . with the possible exception of source 1 in 2008 , ( i.e.  the upper , right - hand panel in figure  [ fig03 ] )",
    ", there is no compelling evidence that the locations of the sources in the _ chandra _  data are inconsistent with the locations of the _",
    "2mass _  sources .",
    "for this reason , the images shown in figures  [ fig01 ] and [ fig02 ] have not been adjusted to compensate for any potential registration errors .    after determining that the 2003 and 2008 datasets are registered to an accuracy of about 0.5  arcsec ( 1  pixel ) or better , the rate of expansion was measured in annular wedges a and b ( figures  [ fig01 ] and [ fig02 ] ) as follows . for each epoch ,",
    "an image was created in the sky coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these images have 1  pixel @xmath28 1  pixel ( i.e.  0.492  arcsec @xmath28 0.492  arcsec ) bins and were smoothed with a two - dimensional gaussian function where @xmath29  arcsec .",

    "note that in no case were the best - fit values inconsistent with the values listed in table  [ tab03 ] .",
    "in fact , the fitted parameters were well within the 90% confidence intervals even at @xmath33  pixels . ]",
    "this choice of gaussian widths yields 2003 and 2008 images that have comparable spatial resolutions in regions a and b. the two sky images were used to create images in the coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "here , @xmath34 is the angular radius ( or angular separation ) of a point in the _ chandra _  data from the assumed location of the center of the remnant .",

    "radial profiles were obtained from the @xmath34 and @xmath35 images by summing along the @xmath35 direction .",
    "the radial offset of the 2008 data with respect to the 2003 data was obtained by interpolating each radial profile to a grid with a spacing of @xmath40  pixels ( i.e.  @xmath41  arcsec ) and by minimizing the fit statistic @xmath42 where the `` model '' @xmath43 where the statistical uncertainty @xmath44 and where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the total number of events in the @xmath47th bin of the interpolated radial profiles for the 2003 and 2008 data , respectively , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the number of background events per square arcsec for the 2003 and 2008 data , respectively , @xmath50 is the number of square arcseconds in the @xmath47th bin , @xmath51 is a scaling factor , which compensates for differences in the detector efficiencies , observing times , and source fluxes in the two epochs , and @xmath52 is the radial offset of the 2008 data relative to the 2003 data in units of @xmath40  pixels . in equation  [ eqn03 ] ,",

    "since @xmath52 is quantized in units of @xmath40  pixels , @xmath30 is in units of arcsec .",
    "the uncertainties are listed at the 90% confidence level , which corresponds to a change in @xmath53 of 2.71 . both of the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 were allowed to vary while the confidence intervals were being computed .",
