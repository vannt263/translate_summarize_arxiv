    "specifically , given random variables @xmath0 , the goal is to output a graph on @xmath1 nodes , one for each variable , where the edges encode conditional independence between said variables @xcite .",
    "graphical models have been successfully employed in a variety of applications such as image analysis  @xcite , natural language processing @xcite and genetics  @xcite for example .",

    ", much effort has been devoted to estimating the underlying structure of the graphical model  @xcite under sparsity assumptions . at the same time , the theoretical side of social network analysis has witnessed a lot of activity around the estimation and reconstruction of stochastic blockmodels  @xcite as a simple but efficient way to capture the notion of _ communities _ in social networks .",
    "these random graph models assume an underlying partition of the nodes , leading to inhomogeneous connection probabilities between nodes .",
    "given the realization of such a graph , the goal is to recover the partition of the nodes .",
    "already in the context of a balanced partition into two communities , this model has revealed interesting threshold phenomena  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we combine the notions of stochastic blockmodel and that of graphical model by assuming that we observe independent copies of a vector @xmath5 distributed according to an ising model with a block structure analogous to the one arising in the stochastic blockmodel .",

    "there are however much fewer vectors with low energy in the discrete hypercube and this tension between _ energy _ and _ entropy _ is responsible for phase transitions in such systems .    when positive , the parameter @xmath31 is called _ inverse temperature _ and it controls the strength of interactions , and therefore , the weight given to the energy term . when @xmath32 , the entropy term dominates and @xmath33 tends to the uniform density over @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the dirac point mass at @xmath38 and @xmath39 denotes the all - ones vector of dimension @xmath1 , the energy term dominates and it affects the global behavior of the system as follows .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the _ magnetization _ of @xmath41 .",

    "when @xmath1 is large enough , the curie - weiss model is known to obey a phase - transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic behavior when the temperature crosses a threshold ( see subsection  [ sub : cw ] for details ) .",
    "this striking result indicates that when the temperature decreases ( @xmath44 increases ) , the model changes from that of a disordered system ( no preferred inclination towards @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) to that of an ordered system ( a majority of the spins agree to the same sign ) .",
    "this behavior is interesting in the context of modeling social interactions and indicates that if the strength of interactions is large enough ( @xmath47 ) then a partial consensus may be found .",
    "formally , the curie - weiss model may also be defined in the anti - ferromagnetic case @xmath48we abusively call it  inverse temperature \" in this case also  to model the fact that negative interactions are encouraged . for such choices of @xmath44 ,",
    "the distribution is concentrated around balanced configurations @xmath41 that have magnetization close to 0 . moreover , as @xmath49 , @xmath50 converges to the uniform distribution on configurations with zero magnetization ( assuming that @xmath1 is even so that such configurations exist for simplicity ) . as a result ,",
    "the anti - ferromagnic case arises when no consensus may be found and and the spins are evenly split between positive and negative .    in reality",
    "though , a collective behavior may be fragmented into communities and the ibm is meant to reflect this structure . specifically , since @xmath51 , the strength @xmath44 of interactions within the blocks @xmath11 and @xmath52 is larger than that across blocks @xmath11 and @xmath52 . as will become clear from our analysis , the case where @xmath53 presents interesting configurations whereby the two blocs @xmath11 and @xmath52 have polarized behaviors , that is opposite magnetization in each block .",

    "in particular , we often consider asymptotic statements as @xmath58 .",
    "however , in the statistical applications of section  [ sec : stat ] we are interested in understanding the scaling of the number of observations as a function of @xmath1 . to that end ,",
