    "transport phenomena are often encountered in solutions , fluids , gels , and quasi particles associated with elementary excitations in solids , and so on . in particular , low dimensional transport phenomena are received much attraction in various research fields of electronic devices such as polymeric conducting materials@xcite , quasi one - dimensional organic conductors  @xcite and rechargeable batteries  @xcite . in these matarials or devices , low dimensional diffusive or hopping motion such as charged ions , defects , quasi - particles(e.g . , exciton , polaron , conformon ) in their crystalline lattices plays an important role in origins of their physical properties .",
    "some of such molecular motions in crystalline solids are called `` lattice diffusion , '' which is defined as transport phenomena of ( quasi-)particles of which positions are restricted in lattice points in crystals .",
    "the motion often leads to motional averaging of local magnetic fields in solids .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance(nmr ) spectroscopy is one of promising nondestructive methods for investigating these phenomena .",
    "several attempts have recently been reported to make nmr measurements of ultra slow diffusion in solids@xcite .    among these ,",
    "the pulse field gradient(pfg ) technique with strong magnetic field gradient(mfg ) has been given much attention for detection of such diffusions .",
    "however , the pfg technique involves some problems in cases , which are ( i ) attenuation of sensitivity in association of application of pfg , ( ii ) a lack of magnitude of pfg for ultra slow diffusion measurements , and ( iii ) the case that the system has large internal mfg(@xmath0 ) compared to external pfg and/or large heterogeneous mfg .    the problem ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "are often pronounced in molecular diffusion measurements . since the problem ( iii ) is not problematic in cases of systems with large diffusion coefficient , it has often been ignored . in such cases ,",
    "the internal mgf is thought to be averaged to zero , and then effects of the internal mfg will be small or negligible .",
    "however , in solids , the diffusion coefficient can be quite small and a local internal mfg , which in some cases heterogeneous and/or anisotropic , can be remained@xcite .    in such situations ,",
    "an effective mfg is no longer the same as the external mfg ( @xmath1 ) , which is likely to mask the accurate diffusion coefficient . even in the case that the system has large local mfg",
    ", it will not be problematic if the root mean squared displacement by diffusion(@xmath2 ) is much larger than the periodicity of the local mfg , because the local mfg is expected to be averaged out during diffusion .",
    "on the contrary , in the case of systems with small diffusion coefficient , the local mfg can be remained and spin echo trains of magnetic resonance can be further attenuated by the local mfg as well as by the external mfg .",
    "so far , there are several kinds of possible approaches to cancel the effect of local mfg , that is to set up the experimental condition of @xmath3 by production of large external mfg by an anti - helmholtz superconducting magnet or a fringe field of a superconducting magnet . by using anti - helmholtz superconducting magnet",
    ", one can obtain a mfg up to 200 t@xmath4m@xmath5@xcite . on the other hands , by using superconducting fringe field , one can obtain up to 60 t@xmath4m@xmath5@xcite .",
    "there are the other approaches to cancel local mfg by using bipolar gradients@xcite or rotary echos@xcite .",
    "these methods are based on the idea of cancelation of unwanted local mfg . on the contrary , we are interested in local mfg , which is thought to be characteristic to each systems particularly to solids , and it should be closely related to the molecular and electronic structure .",
    "there are a number of literatures available to calculate spin echos in restricted geometries  @xcite .",
    "most of these researches are devoted to describe pulse gradient spin echo(pgse ) experiments .",
    "the spin echo experiment under a static field gradient is a kind of niche applications , and its theoretical treatment , namely , solvation of bloch - torrey equation  @xcite , is still lacking .",
    "up to now , axelrod and sen have shown a solution of one dimensional bloch - torrey equation under the linear gradient condition by using an eigen mode technique@xcite . in this letter",
    ", we shall extend their treatment to spin echo experiments with two - dimensional lattice diffusion under arbitrary magnetic field gradient shape .",
    "although the general theory of spectral density function for two - dimensional lattice diffusion is developed  @xcite , effects of 2d diffusion on nuclear spin echo experiments have not been investigated so far .",
    "the method developed here will be useful to investigate transport phenomena in low dimensional solids , such as movement of lattice defects(including soliton in disordered solids ) , dynamics of elementary excitation(including exciton and polaron ) , transport of charge carriers , and so on .",
    "further , recent developments on magnetic resonance force microscopy(mrfm ) show that one can perform _ in situ _ imaging with a scale of several tens of nanometers , where ultra high magnetic field gradients of over 10@xmath6 t / m are generally used  @xcite . up to now , there are no publications available to obtain spin - echo measurements under a condition of such a huge mfg , which can be comparable to local magnetic field gradient with atomic scale .",
    "the theory presented in this letter will be useful for analyses of such experiments as well .",
    "the method presented here is based on the numerical solution of the bloch - torrey equation by the fourier - spectrum method@xcite .",
    "axelrod and sen have proposed the methodology for calculating amplitudes of spin echos for a nucleus diffusing under a linearly inhomogeneous magnetic field condition@xcite . although they have shown the solution with a linear magnetic field gradient by an eigen mode expansion method , the details of the numerical procedure was not shown . in this article",
    ", we shall demonstrate a mathematical formulation of solvation of the bloch - torrey equation by the fourier - spectrum method and explore spin echo amplitudes under various magnetic field gradients .",
    "so far , we have attempted to solve the differential equation of diffusion equation in the real space by crank - nicolson method@xcite .",
    "however , we have suffered from the underflow of variables due to iterative multiplication in many times , of the time evolution operator for the spin echo experient .",
    "furthermore , while the crank - nicolson method preserves the absolute stability against the size of each step in the real space , we observed the strong dependence of spin echo amplitudes on magnitude of interval of time step .",
    "thus , these problems lead us to motivation for numerical simulation in the fourier space concerning coordinates in real space .    below we shall describe the mathematical formulation for bloch - torrey equation with magnetic field gradient of an arbitrary wave form .",
    "the bloch - torrey equation is shown in the following : @xmath7 where the tilde denotes dimensionless parameter in order the problem to be treated as general .",
    "the effects of longitudinal relaxation(@xmath8 ) and intrinsic transverse relaxation(@xmath9 ) in original bloch - torrey equation was neglected in the calculation .",
    "but the effect must of course be taken into account in practical applications .",
    "dimensionless diffusion coefficient(@xmath10 ) , dimensionless gyromagnetic ratio(@xmath11 ) , and one - dimensional coordinate(@xmath12 ) are defined as @xmath13 @xmath14 is a functional form of 1d mfg .",
    "let us think the expansion of the eq.([bloch - torrey ] ) by a series of orthogonal functions , @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 & = & \\tilde{d}_0 { \\mathcal f}[\\frac{\\partial^2 m}{\\partial \\tilde{x}^2 } ] -i \\tilde{\\gamma } { \\mathcal f}[f(\\tilde{x})m].\\label{btk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we used linearity of orthogonal function transformation .",
    "the second term of the right hand side of eq.([btk ] ) is obtained by convolution : @xmath17 & = & { \\mathcal f}[f]{\\bf * } { \\mathcal f}[g].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , one can write down the practical form of eq.([bloch - torrey ] ) like the following : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 = \\int^{1/2}_{-1/2 } m(\\tilde{x},t ) \\psi_k(\\tilde{x } ) d\\tilde{x}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath20 is a k - th coefficient for orthogonal function transform(for example , fourier transform ) of @xmath12 : @xmath21 further , the first term of the right hand side of eq.([conv ] ) can be obtained by using the fact that second derivative in real space corresponds to the multiplication with @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23    here , @xmath24 @xmath25",
    "let us think a basis set with taking account of the boundary condition of @xmath12:[-1/2:1/2 ] .",
    "shown below is the eigen modes using sinusoidal(only cosine components ) orthogonal functions for the laplacian , @xmath26 , of the one dimensional diffusion equation , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and corresponding eigen values are @xmath29 .",
    "since it is unnecessary to think the time ordering during the echo time , @xmath30 , in transverse relaxation time measurements , one can take @xmath30 as one step .",
    "the time evolution operator for the echo time , @xmath30 , can be defined as @xmath31 thus , the propagator for the two pulse hahn echo  @xcite can be express as @xmath32 similarly , that for the second echo of carr - purcell meiboom - gill(cpmg )  @xcite can be expressed as @xmath33 and that for n - th echo of cpmg , @xmath34 therefore , the k - th fourier component of the magnetization at a time , @xmath35 , can be calculated by @xmath36 here , the initial magnetization , @xmath37 , can be obtained by using the initial condition of @xmath38 : @xmath39 the fourier component , @xmath37 , of the initial magnetization , can be calculated by inverse fourier transform of @xmath38 .",
    "for example , in the case of homogeneous spin density , namely , in the case of the initial condition of @xmath40(constant ) , all the components are zero except k=0 since the inverse fourier transform is a @xmath41-function . substituting the obtained @xmath37 into eq.([mkt ] ) , the k - th magnetization , @xmath42 , at a time , @xmath43 , can be computed .",

    "unfortunately , we could not find the superoperator for the convolution , then , we implemented the direct calculation of convolution by using a parallel programming technique of the message passing interface(mpi ) standard .",
    "fig.[gpa ] shows a comparison of the numerical solution of bloch - torrey equation by the fourier spectrum method , with the results of the second - order cumulant expansion(so - called gaussian phase approximation ) .",
    "the calculation was performed for the cases of a linear(@xmath95 ) and parabolic(@xmath96 ) magnetic field gradients in one - dimensional . according to axelrod and sen , the second cumulant expansion become a good approximation for both the short time and motionaly averaging regimes@xcite . for the linear case",
    ", we obtained the exactly same behavior on the result of fourier spectral method as the result by axelrod and sen  @xcite .",
    "as for the localized regime , the relaxation exponent indicates strong dependence on the functional shape of a magnet field gradient .      a sinusoidal function may be a good candidate as a first step , for the expression of internal magnetic field gradient in a crystal .",
    "for example , the peierls potential is often approximated by the sinusoidal .",
    "fig.[1d_2d ] shows the decay exponentials for the 8th cpmg echos under the condition of the sinusoidal gradients , shown in the figure , as a function of dimensionless diffusion coefficient , @xmath97 ( @xmath98 for one - dimensional cases and @xmath99 for two - dimensional cases ) .",
    "we took into account the lowest eigen modes up to 16th and used the @xmath11 value of 10 .",
    "for the so - called localization regime , the lower attenuation of decay exponential was observed for the 2d diffusion case than that for the 1d case .",
    "it is also found that the dimensionality of diffusion is insensitive both at the short time and at the motional averaging regimes . at the motional averaging regimes , although a slight increase of echo attenuation occurs on 2d cases , the decay exponent as a function of @xmath97 shows the same slope irrespective of dimensionality of diffusion .",
    "now let us look at a situation that a system of interest shows the anisotropic diffusion from internal and/or external reasons .",
    "for example , putting the sample in the external electric field corresponds to the latter case .",
    "fig.[aniso ] shows the effect of anisotropy of diffusion on cpmg decay exponent .",
    "one observe a double maximum profile of relaxation exponent for diffusion with an anisotropy of over 200 .",
    "two peaks of the relaxation exponent have some interesting features .    first , while the main peak around the @xmath97 value of unity does not nearly move its position with respect to changes in anisotropy , the second peak moves to positions with larger @xmath97 values proportional to the anisotropy .",
    "second , the ratio of the relaxation exponent at two maxima is almost constant with respect to changes in the anisotropy of diffusion , but the ratio and the shape of peak are strongly dependent to functional form of the field gradient .",
    "third , the differences in dimensionality of diffusion show much larger effect on relaxation exponent than functional form of mfg . by comparing fig.[aniso]a ) and",
    "b ) with c ) and d ) , one can realize that the relaxation exponents for two - dimensional mfg are much larger than those for one - dimensional for the case of isotropic diffusion(@xmath100 ) .    from the above results , it would be possible to determine the functional form of mfg by transverse relaxation time measurements at localization regime when the anisotropy of diffusion is large .",
    "if the mfg is originated from internal one , for example , crystalline periodicity , peierls potential  @xcite , friedel oscillation  @xcite , and so on , transverse relaxation time measurements will become a novel tool for determination of the functional form of these internal properties .",
    "we have explored diffusion and internal local magnetic field gradients in solids by nuclear magnetic resonance(nmr ) transverse relaxation time measurements .",
    "the fourier - spectrum method was employed in order to solve the bloch - torrey equation with arbitrary magnetic field gradients in one- and two - dimensional lattice restrictions .",
    "if there are no phase transitions or deformations of samples for a temperature region interested , variable temperature cpmg measurements with a fixed echo time have a possibility for determination of dimensionality of diffusion processes found in the samples .",
    "the method will be applicable to several research areas such as transport phenomena of charge carriers in ion conducting materials , fluid dynamics in low dimensional porus materials , and dynamics of low dimensional elementary excitations in solids .",
