    "the cosmological mass density of , @xmath0 , observed as a function of redshift is a fundamental quantity closely related to the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "its apparent lack of evolution in the redshift interval @xmath6 $ ] @xcite is puzzling since both the physical conditions of the igm and the properties of the ionizing background are thought to evolve between these epochs .",
    "remarkable efforts have been spent in recent years to extend the measure of @xmath0 to redshift larger than 5 @xcite where a decrease of the star formation rate density is observed @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 is dominated by the metals produced in situ by the observed star forming galaxies , we would expect a decrease of its value at those redshifts .",
    "vice versa , the value of @xmath0 could remain constant if it reflects the metallicity of a diffuse medium pre - enriched at very high redshift .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this is a simplified scenario since , as redshift increases , the observed  absorptions likely trace gas in structures of decreasing over - density and also the ionizing spectrum evolves in shape and intensity . as a consequence",
    ", the behaviour of @xmath0 could be different from that of @xmath7 and of the mean igm metallicity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most recent measurements of  absorptions in spectra of qsos at @xmath8 seem to indicate a downturn in the  mass density at @xmath9 @xcite , though based only on 3 detected  lines . at redshift @xmath10 , a fundamental measurement of @xmath11 has been carried out by ( * ? ? ?",

    "in this paper , we present a new measurement of @xmath0 in the redshift range @xmath18 $ ] based on a sample of 25 high resolution , high signal - to - noise qso spectra plus an additional sample of 8 qso spectra from the literature .",

    "most of them were obtained with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) @xcite at the kueyen unit of the eso vlt ( cerro paranal , chile ) in the framework of the eso large programme ( lp ) : `` the cosmic evolution of the igm '' @xcite . in this work",
    ", 3 more qsos were added to that sample , mainly to increase the redshift extension above @xmath22 .",
    "uves spectra of the qso : q0055 - 269 , pks2000 - 330 and pks1937 - 101 , were downloaded from the eso archive and reduced with the uves pipeline following the standard procedure . the continuum level was determined by interpolating with a cubic spline the region of the spectrum free from evident absorption features .    for all the qso in the sample ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , the  forest was defined as the interval between the  emission and 5000  from the  emission to avoid the proximity region where most of the intrinsic systems are found .",
    "the absorption features present in this wavelength interval were identified inspecting the spectra by eye to look for the most common doublets ( ,  and ) .",
    "then , other lines were identified testing their compatibility with the ,  and  redshifts . finally , lines whose identity was still unknown after this operation , were associated with metal systems detected in the forest or recognized as part of other multiplets ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the  doublets were fitted with voigt profiles using the lyman context of the midas reduction package @xcite .",
    "a minimum number of components was adopted to fit the velocity profile in order to reach a normalized @xmath23 .",
    "the fit parameters for all the detected  lines are reported in table  [ tab : lines ] . in the following",
    ", we will refer to  _ components _ or simply  _ lines _ meaning the velocity components in which every absorption profile has been decomposed .",
    "however , in order to compare our results with previous works and with data at lower resolution , we will work also with  _ systems _ formed by groups of components .",
    "_ systems _ were defined in the following way : for each list of  components corresponding to a single qso the velocity separations among all the lines have been computed and sorted in ascending order .",
    "if the smallest separation is less than @xmath24 ( corresponding to the velocity separation adopted by s01 ) the two lines are merged into a new line with column density equal to the sum of the column densities , and redshift equal to the average of the redshifts weighted with the column densities of the components . the velocity separation",
    "are then computed again and the procedure is iterated till the smallest separation becomes larger than @xmath25 .",

    "the value of @xmath0 for the column density interval @xmath30@xmath31 can be converted into the igm carbon content by mass , with the formula : @xmath32 where , @xmath33 @xcite is the contribution of baryons to the critical density and /c is the fraction of c which is triply ionized , which depends on the assumed ionizing background . assuming the maximum relative abundance of , that is /c",

    "the metallicity measured at high redshift is in agreement with the result obtained at @xmath43 by @xcite with the pixel optical depth method , in the case of over - densities above @xmath44 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath0 traces mainly the metallicity of the over - dense regions in the proximity of galaxies and its redshift evolution is linked with that of the strong systems .",
    "@xcite found a median metallicity [ c , o / h ]  @xmath45 for the intergalactic gas at @xmath46 with a method based on the direct detections of the absorption lines which takes into account also the upper limits .",

    "those winds are very effective in transporting the gas without heating it too much .",
    "their fiducial simulation reproduces consistently the star formation rate of the universe , the volume averaged metallicity of the igm and the lack of evolution of @xmath0 from @xmath49 , as observed in the data available at the time .",
    "on the other hand , the predicted mass density of c increases by nearly an order of magnitude toward lower redshifts in the same redshift interval , due to the increase in the total metallicity of the gas .",
    "the constant behaviour of @xmath0 is obtained by balancing the increase in c abundance with galactic winds .",
    "this form of feedback heats the igm causing a decrease of the  ionization fraction .",
    "in particular , the peak of the  ionization fraction distribution as a function of over - density shifts toward larger over - densities as redshift decreases . this is consistent with the increase in the ratio between strong and weak  systems at lower redshifts shown in fig .",

    ", none of the models proposed by od06 predicts an increase of @xmath0 toward lower redshifts .",
    "an improvement in the physics of the wind , plus the introduction of the agb feedback , results in a slight increase of @xmath0 in the ranges @xmath50 and @xmath51 leaving substantially unchanged the other values ( * ? ? ? * od08 ) .",
    "an effect which has not been taken into account up to now is the evolution in the shape of the uv background due to the  re - ionization process expected at redshift @xmath52 .",
    "naively , due to the increase in the number of free hard photons ( ionizing  into ) at the end of the re - ionization epoch , we would expect a trend opposite to what is observed : a decrease of the amount of  after @xmath22 .",
    "however , the details of this process are still under study ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other factors should be accounted for properly : the decrease in the number density of qsos going towards lower redshifts and the fact that at low @xmath53 the regions traced by the strong  absorbers ( driving the evolution of @xmath0 ) could be only mildly affected by the cosmic uv background .",
    "the observed raise of the cosmic  mass density in the redshift range @xmath54 puts a strong constraints on the models describing the interplay between galaxies and their surrounding medium , suggesting that something is still missing in the physical implementation of galactic feedback .",
