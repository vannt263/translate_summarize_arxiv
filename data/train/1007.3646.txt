    "<S> many fascinating experiments coupling emitters and plasmons have been proposed or performed , such as enhanced spontanous emission into free space  @xcite , spatially directed emission by an optical nanoantenna  @xcite , or the use of the emitter s nonlinearity as an optical transistor  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these experiments require a quantum emitter that is stable in position and emission rate , and well defined in emission frequency and orientation of its dipole axis relative to the plasmonic structure .    </S>",
    "<S> epitaxially grown self - assembled semiconductor quantum dots have proven to be bright and non - blinking single photon sources  @xcite , fulfilling all the above requirements . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate to our knowledge for the first time the controlled coupling of a _ single _ epitaxial quantum dot to a plasmonic nanoantenna . </S>",
    "<S> excellent control over the coupling is a prerequisite for realizing more complex plasmonic devices making use of several single emitters , where one can not rely anymore on random placement of emitters relative to the plasmonic structures . to achieve this degree of control , </S>",

    "<S> the quantum dots are formed by first depositing the algaas barrier material followed by a layer of gaas . during this growth step , gaas accumulates in the holes and forms the quantum dots , while outside the holes only a thin gaas wetting layer remains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of sample growth is given in the supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dots are located 10  nm beneath the sample surface . </S>",
    "<S> the shallow depth of the emitters enables near - field coupling with plasmonic structures placed on the sample surface . </S>",

    "<S> a schematic of the studied structure is shown in [ fig : nanoman]b .        </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dots can be excited resonantly , i.e. , by absorption of a photon by the quantum dot , or non - resonantly by carriers that are created outside the dot and diffuse into it . here </S>",
    "<S> we excite the quantum dot non - resonantly by creating electrons and holes in the barrier and wetting layer using an optical parametric oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillator produces 400  fs pulses with a photon energy that can be tuned between 1.8 and 2.4  ev . </S>",

    "<S> all the optical measurements were performed at a temperature of 10  k.    as optical antennas we use spherical gold nanoparticles with a diameter of 90  nm as specified by the manufacturer ( nanopartz inc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nanoparticles were deposited on the sample surface by drop casting from an aqueous solution . </S>",
    "<S> the sample had been patterned with markers so that the same area can be studied with afm and optical microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> an afm was used to identify regions of the sample with a low concentration of gold particles . </S>",
    "<S> ten of the nanoparticles were moved on top of nearby quantum dots using the afm tip . </S>",
    "<S> the optical properties of nanoantennas were characterized by recording the scattering spectrum of single antennas using dark - field microspectroscopy  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> one can find a corresponding surface depression in an afm image of the same area of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the quantum dots are comparable in brightness . </S>",
    "<S> the emitters decorated with a gold nanoparticle , however , appear markedly brighter as seen in [ fig : nanoman]c . </S>",
    "<S> to exclude a coincidence , we removed the particle from three quantum dots ( marked by red circles in [ fig : nanoman]d ) after characterizing their optical properties . </S>",
    "<S> the photoluminescence of these three quantum dots changed to approximately the ensemble average value .        to quantify the influence of the nanoparticle on the emission properties of the quantum dots </S>",
    "<S> , we analyzed the photoluminescence of 228 emitters by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian function to each emission spot in the luminescence image . </S>",
    "<S> the thus obtained brightness distribution is shown in [ fig : histo ] . </S>",
    "<S> the center of the distribution was determined as 194 counts/30 ms ( 6470 counts / s ) by fitting a gaussian function to the histogram . </S>",
    "<S> the brightness of the 10 emitters coupled to a nanoantenna was determined in a similar fashion . </S>",
    "<S> we observe an increase in the photoluminescence intensity of up to a factor of 6 compared to the ensemble average . </S>",
    "<S> all our antenna - coupled quantum dots have a brightness that is greater than the ensemble average value . </S>",
    "<S> one advantage of our approach is the possibility to compare the properties of an emitter - antenna complex directly with those of the same single emitter without the antenna . </S>",
    "<S> here we did this by removing the gold nanoparticle from the quantum dot for the three dots encircled in red in [ fig : nanoman]d . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the photoluminescence intensity is shown in [ fig : histo]b . </S>",
    "<S> both the reference quantum dots and the unmodified emitter - antenna complexes remain at a similar brightness , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the brightness of the three emitters from which the antennas were removed decreased to a value well within the ensemble distribution . </S>",
    "<S> for these quantum dots we deduce photoluminescence enhancement factors of 3.5 , 3.7 , and 6.1 when compared to their emission without antenna . </S>",
    "<S> the spread in the enhancement can be explained by a variation of the relative position of the antennas with respect to the quantum dots .        to determine the origin of the enhancement in photoluminescence intensity let us compare the emission spectra of the quantum dots with and without antenna as shown in [ fig : emissiondecay]a . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the photoluminescence spectrum displayed in [ fig : emissiondecay]a for the quantum dot coupled to the antenna was shifted in energy by 1.4  mev to compensate for spectral shifts most likely due to surface charges in the vicinity of the quantum dot . at 10  nw excitation power </S>",
    "<S> the emission spectrum of the quantum dot without antenna is dominated by the exciton transition ( [ fig : emissiondecay]a ) . at 50  </S>",
    "<S> nw excitation power the exciton line starts to saturate and a second emission line appears . </S>",
    "<S> compatible with previous reports on gaas / algaas dots  @xcite , we identify this as one of the trions , i.e. , charged exciton , transition from its super - linear excitation power dependence and its lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> the antenna - enhanced quantum dots show already at 10  nw excitation power an emission spectrum that resembles that of the unenhanced emitter at higher excitation power ( [ fig : emissiondecay]a ) . from this </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the emitter in the quantum dot - nanoparticle complex experiences an about 5 times higher excitation power density due to the gold particle . </S>",
    "<S> the field enhancement around the plasmonic nanoparticle locally increases the probability that an electron - hole pair is created . </S>",
    "<S> the photoluminescence enhancement as determined from luminescence images is 6.1 for this emitter . </S>",
    "<S> this is in good agreement with the ratio of the excitation powers for which the emission spectra of the quantum dot with and without antenna is similar . </S>",
    "<S> also for the other emitters the agreement between the enhancement values determined with the two methods was good . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus attribute the brightness enhancement predominantly to an increase of the excitation rate . </S>",
    "<S> this is also supported by measurements of spectrally integrated luminescence decay . in [ fig : emissiondecay]b we show the luminescence decay traces corresponding to the spectra displayed in [ fig : emissiondecay]a for 10 nw excitation power and for 50nw with and without antenna , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we observe no significant changes in the decay dynamics due to the antenna .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the emission lines of the antenna - quantum dot complexes appear slightly narrower than the emission of the same dots without antenna at comparable emission intensity . in the usual far - field </S>",
    "<S> excitation scheme carriers are generated in a larger volume than in the presence of the antenna . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to fluctuating charges , broadening the dot s emission by spectral diffusion .    to further elucidate the effect of the plasmonic antenna on the optical properties of the quantum dots in our structure we have studied the influence of the excitation wavelength on the photoluminescence . for non - resonant excitation , </S>",
    "<S> the luminescence rate of the emitters depends on the carrier density in their vicinity and their diffusion into the quantum dot . assuming a dipole transition , for low excitation power the carrier density is proportional to the local intensity of the electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation rate of the quantum dots will thus be maximized when the excitation photon energy is tuned to the antenna resonance .     for the spread at 2.06 ev ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectral_enh ] shows the photoluminescence enhancement of the quantum dots coupled to a nanoparticle antenna as a function of excitation energy for an average excitation power of about 50 nw . the enhancement was determined by comparing the brightness of the antenna - enhanced emitters to an ensemble of reference quantum dots that were not coupled to an antenna . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a peak in the measured photoluminescence enhancement at approximately 2.0  ev energy . at the plasmon resonance the electromagnetic field </S>",
    "<S> is enhanced close to the particle and the excitation rate of electron - hole pairs in the vicinity of the quantum dot is thus increased . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement maximum occurs at a slightly lower energy than the plasmon resonance as seen from the scattering spectrum shown in [ fig : spectral_enh ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the report of bryant  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the near - field resonance occurs red - shifted of the far - field scattering resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the emission of the quantum dots is not modified ( [ fig : emissiondecay]b ) as it occurs far off the antenna s plasmon resonance .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced single epitaxial gaas  quantum dots as emitters for plasmonics by demonstrating the controlled enhancement of the excitation efficiency . placing a gold nanoparticle in the vicinity of </S>",
    "<S> the emitter resulted in an increase in the photoluminescence intensity of about a factor of eight . in the near - field of the antenna close to the quantum dot more carriers </S>",
    "<S> are generated so that the excitation rate is increased . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is supported by the observation that the decay dynamics of the emitters is unaltered by the coupling to the antenna . </S>",
    "<S> varying the wavelength of the incident light clearly demonstrates that the photoluminescence enhancement originates from the plasmon resonance of the antenna .    </S>",
    "<S> our scheme can be applied to more complex antennas and more than one emitter . </S>",
    "<S> for example , rod - like plasmon resonant metal particles can be positioned in the same way as here using afm . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the topography of the quantum dots can be used to first determine their position and subsequently fabricate antenna structures by electron - beam lithography on top of them . </S>",
    "<S> the gaas quantum dots provide a stable , solid - state source of photons that , when coupled to plasmonic nanostructures , forms an attractive system in which to study light - matter interactions and to use as a basis for nanophotonic applications .    </S>",
