    "fermion determinants produce an effective measure for the boson fields of a euclidean field theory when the fermions are integrated out , as shown long ago by matthews and salam [ 1 ] .",
    "such determinants in an external boson field , or a random boson field with a cutoff , are infinite dimensional and need to be defined [ 2 ] before the boson fields can be integrated . once defined , their analysis is notoriously difficult , especially if they possess a symmetry that should be preserved .",
    "for example , most classical estimates of fermion determinants [ 3 ] invariant under a local u(1 ) transformation violate this invariance .",
    "lack of nonperturbative information on fermion determinants is reflected in the necessity to make loop expansions or the more extreme quenched ( valence ) approximation . as a result physical effects predicted by the theory",
    "may be lost .",
    "+ nonperturbative information on the fermion determinant , such as its growth in the complex coupling plane , is central to an analysis of the nature of the perturbation series of the associated field theory [ 4 ] .",
    "intuition tells one that fermi statistics , visible in the alternating signs of the determinant s loop expansion , ought to slow down the growth of a perturbation series with order . + there is also the question of stability .",
    "specifically , in the case of an abelian gauge field , the measure is gaussian , so that if the fermion determinant grows faster than an inverted gaussian , it is doubtful that it is integrable respect to the gauge field s measure .",
    "+ given the sparseness of nonperturbative information on physically relevant fermion determinants in four dimensions we thought it useful to try to find a solvable example for a broad class of boson fields .",
    "an obvious choice is the fermion determinant of quantum electrodynamics in time - independent , unidirectional , inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "although of physical interest , this choice of fields suffers from the fact that they are a set of measure zero as far as the functional integral over the vector potential is concerned . nevertheless , the fermion determinant for such magnetic fields remains unsolved except for the special case of a homogeneous magnetic field that was dealt with over half a century ago by euler , heisenberg , and weisskopf [ 5 ] and later on again by schwinger [ 6 ] .",
    "a thorough understanding of this problem would be helpful for a more general understanding of the physical content of fermion determinants in quantum electrodynamics . as we will see below , there are some significant simplifications that recommend this problem for analysis .",
    "+ this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review previous relevant results .",

    "in a previous paper [ 7 ] it was shown that the renormalized fermion determinant , @xmath0 , of quantum electrodynamics in four dimensions ( qed@xmath3 ) in a smooth , static , unidirectional magnetic field with fast decrease at infinity is related to the euclidean , massive schwinger model s ( euclidean qed@xmath4 s ) determinant , @xmath1 , in the same magnetic field . specifically ,    @xmath5 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad + \\displaystyle\\frac{v_{||}}{2\\pi } \\displaystyle\\int^\\infty_{m^2 } d m^2 \\ln \\mbox{det}_3(m^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the gauge invariant @xmath6 is related to @xmath1 by    @xmath7    since the first term in ( 2.2 )",
    "is the contribution to the effective action from the second - order vacuum polarization graph , @xmath8 may be viewed as the sum of all one - loop fermion graphs in two dimensions beginning in fourth order .",
    "our designation of this sum by @xmath8 follows the definition of seiler [ 2 ] and simon [ 3 ] , with the third - order graph vanishing by @xmath9-invariance .",
    "equation ( 2.1 ) states that the sum of the corresponding graphs in qed@xmath3 is obtained by integrating @xmath8 over the fermion mass @xmath10 .",
    "the first term in ( 2.1 ) is the contribution to the effective action of qed@xmath3 from the on - shell renormalized second - order vacuum polarization graph .",
    "the function @xmath11 is the fourier transform of the magnetic field , which may be asumed to point along the @xmath12-axis , in which case @xmath13 is the volume of the @xmath14 box . in both ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 )",
    "the determinants are defined by schwinger s proper time definition [ 6 ] .",
    "note that the charge , @xmath15 , will always occur in the combination @xmath16 in position space , which has the invariant dimension @xmath17 .",
    "note also that in euclidean qed@xmath4 potentials associated with unidirectional magnetic fields are a set of measure one .",
    "+ the lesson of ( 2.1 ) is that the massive schwinger model [ 8 ] is more than a model in view of its direct bearing on physics in four dimensions . unlike the determinant of the massless schwinger model [ 9 ] , @xmath1 in ( 2.2 )",
    "is not known explicitly .",
    "nevertheless there are some important results .",
    "one of these is an expression of the paramagnetism of fermions in an external magnetic field as summarized by the diamagnetic bound \" @xmath18 for @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "this bound also expresses the positivity of the one - loop effective action for euclidean qed@xmath4 . as a consequence of ( 2.3 )",
    "we were able to put an upper bound on the growth of @xmath0 in qed@xmath3 for strong , unidirectional , inhomogeneous magnetic fields . performing the dilation @xmath20 on the vector potential and letting @xmath21 become large we obtained    @xmath22    where @xmath23 [ 7 ] .",
    "+ there are other results for @xmath1 implicit in the literature . for example , if @xmath24 falls off sufficiently rapidly so that @xmath25 for all @xmath26 , then one can relate @xmath27 to the zeros of the determinant , considered as a function of a complex coupling @xmath15 [ 12 ] .",
    "it is known [ 13 ] that for @xmath28 these zeros occur in quartets @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and therefore @xmath1 can not vanish for real @xmath15 for these potentials [ 14 ] .",
    "+ we will defer the discussion of the result of haba [ 15 ] for @xmath0 until sec.iii .",
    "+ in view of the direct connection between qed@xmath3 and qed@xmath4 in the case of unidirectional magnetic fields it was thought worthwhile to obtain more specific information on @xmath1 that would enable one to make use of ( 2.1 ) . in a second paper [ 16 ] it was shown that the exact calculation of @xmath1 reduces to a problem in nonrelativistic , supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",

    "is related to the vector potential by @xmath34 and to the magnetic field by @xmath35 or    @xmath36    the antisymmetric tensor @xmath37 is normalized to @xmath38 .",
    "again , the starting point for the derivation of ( 2.5 ) was the proper time definition of @xmath1 , which respects gauge invariance and allows one to select the lorentz gauge .",
    "our representation of @xmath1 makes a sharp separation between the contribution from the massless schwinger model , the first term in ( 2.5 ) , and its massive counterpart .",
    "we have not integrated the first term in ( 2.5 ) by parts as is usually done . for nonzero flux fields",
    ", @xmath24 falls off like @xmath39 , and therefore an integration by parts is invalid in this case .",
    "+ within the lorentz gauge there is still the restricted gauge freedom of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a constant . since @xmath1 is gauge invariant , the term proportional to @xmath41 in ( 2.5 ) must vanish , in which case    @xmath42,\\ ] ]    since @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "differentiating ( 2.7 ) with respect to @xmath15 gives the index theorem on a two - dimensional euclidean manifold [ 17 ] , + @xmath45\\nonumber\\\\ & = & n_+ - n_- + \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\pi } \\sum_l [ \\delta^l_+ ( 0 ) - \\delta ^l_- ( 0)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 denote the number of positive and negative chirality zero - energy bound states of @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the zero - energy phase shifts for scattering by the hamiltonians @xmath47 in a suitable angular momentum basis @xmath49 .",

    "we conjectured that this was true in general , and we will show that it is in sec .",
    "+ finally , we wish to retract a claim in [ 16 ] . by the aharonov - casher theorem",

    "thus , if @xmath59 there are zero - energy bound states , and it was stated that when these are included in the second term of ( 2.9 ) the logarithmic growth of @xmath33 and the slow , algebraic fall off of the bound - state wave functions for large @xmath60 would cause @xmath1 to vanish .",
    "this is false .",
    "in fact , zero modes are suppressed in @xmath1 as we will see in sec .",
    "the fermion determinant is part of a functional integral whose measure , @xmath61 , is that of the gauge - fixed , free maxwell field . as @xmath62 may be realized on @xmath63 , the space of tempered distributions , we seem to be stuck with rough potentials that are hard to analyze .",
    "a way out is to realize that there is a logarithmic ultraviolet divergence in qed@xmath4 due to the vacuum energy graph shown in fig.1 that has to be regularized and subtracted out .",
    "one way to regularize [ 19 ] is to smooth @xmath24 by convoluting it with an ultraviolet cutoff function @xmath64 , the functions of rapid decrease .",
    "that is , let @xmath65 so that @xmath66 is a polynomial bounded @xmath67 function , meaning that for each @xmath68 there is a @xmath69 and a @xmath70 with    @xmath71    the regularized free photon propagator is @xmath72 whose fourier transform , @xmath73 , is proportional to @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the fourier transform of @xmath76 .",
    "one possibility is to choose @xmath77 with @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "note that the measure @xmath61 is not regularized .",
    "thus , without loss of generality we may assume that our potentials are smooth and polynomial bounded .",
    "hereafter we will drop the superscript @xmath82 and denote these potentials simply as @xmath24 . +",
    "now in order that the fermion determinant exist it seems necessary to require the magnetic fields derived from the potentials to have finite flux .",
    "the reason for this restriction is connected with the degeneracy of the ground state associated with the two - dimensional pauli hamiltonian    @xmath83    specifically , avron and seiler [ 20 ] have considered the class of polynomial , infinite - flux magnetic fields    @xmath84    where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are arbitrary real numbers and @xmath87 and n are nonnegative integers .",
    "they have shown that the ground state of h is infinitely degenerate and that the manifold of zero - energy bound state wave functions is parametrized by a point in @xmath88 , irrespective of the translational invariance of the magnetic field . in the constant field case , @xmath89 , one has point spectrum , and the vector space is a plane whose points specify the center of rotation of landau orbits , corresponding to the known degeneracy @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "this degeneracy persists for all excited states in the constant field case , and we suspect that the excited states for fields with @xmath92 are at least as degenerate as @xmath88 . although we will show in sec .",
    "iv that zero - modes are suppressed in our representation ( 2.5 ) of @xmath1 , it can not make sense out of the volume - like divergences associated with the degeneracy of the excited modes . nor are we aware of any definition of determinant that can .",
    "accordingly , we will confine our attention here to finite flux fields . in our view , a determinant of an infinite flux field should be considered as the limit , if it exists , of a determinant calculated from a field confined to local planar regions .",
    "+ restriction to finite flux is also consistent with the additional need to regulate volume divergences before taking the thermodynamic limit of the euclidean green s functions .",
    "such divergences appear in the vacuum energy graphs , including the one in fig.1 , when the determinant is integrated with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "a volume cutoff may be introduced via the determinant , assumed previously calculated for a generic class of fields , by replacing @xmath93 with @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a suitable volume cutoff such as @xmath96 or @xmath97 , the characteristic function of a bounded region @xmath98 .",
    "+ at this point we mention the result of haba [ 15 ] , who studied @xmath0 in the field @xmath99 where @xmath100 is constant , and @xmath101 is sufficiently smooth and bounded . it was concluded that with the introduction of a space - time volume cutoff @xmath82 on the otherwise infinite flux field @xmath102 that    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is bounded in @xmath105 .",
    "this saturates our upper bound ( 2.4 ) for the special case @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "haba then goes on to use this result to obtain evidence suggesting the instability ( trivality ) of qed@xmath3 . in view of the potential importance of this result and of our foregoing remarks concerning infinite flux fields",
    ", it would be worthwhile to repeat the calculation with @xmath102 confined to a finite region @xmath108 from the beginning and repeating haba s estimates with @xmath82 held fixed .",
    "+ as a consequence of the need to regularize and the finite flux condition we may confine our attention to smooth , polynomial bounded potentials that , in the lorentz gauge , have the asymptotic form    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the flux associated with @xmath53 and @xmath111 , the range of @xmath53 .",
    "our long - term goal is to study @xmath1 under the scaling @xmath112 as well as the determinant s mass dependence .",
    "this latter point , as we now know , is especially relevant to determining @xmath113 in qed@xmath3 for unidirectional , static , inhomogenous magnetic fields .",
    "+ we know of no previous calculation of a finite flux determinant associated with massive fermions in two or more dimensions . in sec .",
    "v we will calculate such a determinant analytically for a magnetic field confined to a thin cylindrical shell with radius _ a _ : + @xmath114 although b is not derivable from a polynomial bounded potential it has the virtue that the @xmath115-type singularity of a magnetic flux string is absent and that @xmath1 exists for this field .",
