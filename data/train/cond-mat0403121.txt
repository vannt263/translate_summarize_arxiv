    "the pattern of incommensurate magnetic fluctuations in lsco@xcite resembles the magnetic order seen in lsno , and this has been attributed to the existence of dynamic stripes in lsco .",
    "the fluctuations in superconducting lsco are centred on wavevectors parallel to the cu - o bonds,@xcite but the fluctuations in the non - superconducting state , @xmath15 , are centred on wavevectors at @xmath14 to the cu - o bonds.@xcite these parallels suggest that charge stripe correlations may play an important role in superconducting lsco .",

    "as well as being static on the time scale probed by neutrons and x - rays , the charge stripes are found to be well correlated with correlation lengths in excess of 100  for certain levels of doping.@xcite these two properties make lsno a good system for studying the basic properties of spin - charge stripes .",
    "these studies have revealed many key facts about charge - stripe ordering including the variation of the stability of charge - ordering with doping .",
    "lsno with @xmath17 = 1/3 has stripe order that is particularly stable owing to a commensurability effect that pins the charges to the lattice.@xcite figure [ fig : figure1sr=0_37mk2](a ) shows the commensurate charge - ordering that occurs for @xmath17 = 1/3 .",
    "although this figure shows the charge stripes only residing on the ni sites , recent tunnelling electron microscopy work has shown the charge stripes can also reside on the o sites.@xcite the charge order is even more stable for @xmath18 , forming a ` checkerboard ' pattern in the ni - o@xmath19 layers at temeratures below @xmath20 , which becomes slightly incommensurate below @xmath21.@xcite     plane of la@xmath22sr@xmath23nio@xmath2 .",

    "the observed spin order in la@xmath27sr@xmath28nio@xmath29 is similar to that shown , but is actually incommensurate in the direction perpendicular to the stripes .",

    "lee _ et al._@xcite studied the magnetic order in lsno crystals with @xmath10 and @xmath36 with polarized neutrons in order to determine the direction of the ordered moment .",
    "they concluded that at @xmath37k the spins in the ni - o@xmath19 layers are aligned at an angle @xmath38 to the stripe direction , where @xmath39 for @xmath10 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "however , for the @xmath42 they found a reorientation transition at @xmath43k such that on warming the spins rotate by an angle of @xmath44 towards the stripe direction .",

    "the charge and magnetic ordering temperatures were found to be in good agreement with previous work on samples of similar doping.@xcite the data reveal a spin reorientation similar in size and orientation to that in la@xmath22sr@xmath23nio@xmath51 , but which is slower and occurs at lower temperatures , @xmath53 , for all three doping levels studied .",
    "these spin reorientations , unlike those in the @xmath18 or @xmath36 doped materials , all occur for incommensurate doping levels .",

    "this is a typical feature for magnetization results on lsno compounds that will be reported in detail elsewhere.@xcite of most concern to the present work is the small but sharp drop in magnetization observed at @xmath62 @xmath63k .",

    "there is no maximum , but the increase in magnetization with decreasing temperature first slows down and then begins to rise sharply below 5k .",
    "the increase below 5k could be due to a small amount of paramagnetic impurity in the crystal .",

    "we describe the structural properties of lsno with reference to a tetragonal unit cell , with unit cell parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the samples were mounted with the [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] crystal directions in the horizontal scattering plane .",
    "scans were performed in reciprocal space either parallel to the ( @xmath70 ,  @xmath70,0 ) direction at constant @xmath71 , or parallel to the ( 0 ,  0 ,  @xmath71 ) direction at constant @xmath70 .",
    "we begin by discussing the polarized - neutron diffraction results for @xmath5 .",
    "initially , the neutron polarization @xmath72 was arranged to be parallel to the scattering vector @xmath73 , by an adjustable guide field of a few mt at the sample position . in this configuration",
    "a neutron s spin is flipped during an interaction with electronic magnetic moments , but remains unchanged when scattered by a non - magnetic process , e.g. a lattice distortion .",

    "the second peak is diffraction from the magnetic order peak observed in the nsf channel due to the imperfect spin polarization of the neutron beam . ]",
    "magnetic order bragg peaks were observed at ( @xmath76 , @xmath76 ,  @xmath71 ) positions for all integer @xmath71 .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : hh5](a ) , which shows the sf scattering for a scan parallel to ( @xmath77  0 ) for @xmath71 = 5 at @xmath74k .",
    "the peak positions corresponds to @xmath78 , consistent with previous measurements .",
    "@xcite    figure  [ fig : hh5](b ) shows the nsf scattering for the same scan as fig .",
    "[ fig : hh5](a ) .",
    "the scan contains 2 weak peaks , one at @xmath79 0.646 @xmath6 0.001 corresponding to charge ordering with an incommensurability of @xmath80 = 0.354 @xmath6 0.001 , and the other at @xmath79 0.678 corresponding to magnetic ordering .",
    "the latter appears in the nsf channel due to imperfect polarization of the neutron beam .",
    "we searched for the charge order peak at other equivalent @xmath81 positions , but only at @xmath82 3 and 5 was there a measurable peak .",
    "from the temperature dependence of the charge peak in fig .  [",
    "fig : hh5](b ) we found @xmath83k . by performing scans parallel to @xmath84 we were able to obtain the in - plane charge - order correlation length perpendicular to the stripe direction of 70 @xmath6 6 .",
    "this compares with a correlation length of 49 @xmath6 5  along the @xmath85 axis .",
    "these results show that the charge order is relatively three - dimensional .",
    "figure  [ lscan ] shows a scan parallel to @xmath86 through the magnetic order peaks .",
    "the widths of the peaks in this scan relate to the correlation length along the c - axis , however we observed that the correlation lengths for even and odd @xmath71 differ by a factor @xmath87 2 .",
    "that is , for even @xmath71 we obtain a correlation length of 53.2 @xmath6 1.4  and for odd @xmath71 we obtain a correlation length 108 @xmath6 2  .",
    "we performed scans parallel to @xmath88 on odd @xmath71 peaks , for which we obtained an in - plane correlation length perpendicular to charge stripe direction of 112.6 @xmath6 1.1  .",
    "the intensities of the even and odd @xmath71 magnetic peaks were discussed in work on la@xmath89nio@xmath29 , by p. wochner _",
    "et al._.@xcite for a commensurate stripe spin - ordering , such as @xmath90 , the stripes stack in a body centred arrangement and only the odd @xmath71 magnetic peaks are observed , with the systematic absence of the @xmath82 even peaks .",
    "however , for incommensurate spin - ordering with the stripes either pinned to the ni or o sites,@xcite perfect body - centred stacking can not be achieved .",
    "the disorder thus created , along with the additional disorder introduced due to differing coulomb interactions between the @xmath4 layers , result in the presence of @xmath82 even peaks .",
    "hence , @xmath82 odd peaks have a long correlation length as they come from the ideal long range body - centred stacking , whereas @xmath82 even peaks are a result of the disorder created on the smaller length scale of the non - ideal stacking .    in figure",
    "[ fig : figure1sr=0_37mk2](b ) are shown the positions of two magnetic reflections * q@xmath35 * = ( 0.3225,0.3225,3 ) and * q@xmath19 * = ( 0.6775,0.6775,1 ) .",
    "the vectors * q@xmath35 * and * q@xmath19 * are directed close to @xmath86 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "since magnetic neutron diffraction is sensitive to spin components perpendicular to * q * , the scattering at * q@xmath35 * arises mainly from the total in - plane spin moment , while that at * q@xmath19 * comes mainly from the spin components parallel to the stripe direction and along the c axis .",
    "hence , we performed scans parallel to @xmath88 through * q@xmath19 * at different temperatures to give a first indication as to whether there exists an in - plane spin reorientation like those observed for @xmath42 and 1/2 .",

    "q@xmath19 * can be seen to increase monotonically until it reaches a maximum at @xmath92 20k , then it is seen to decrease in intensity continuously to our base temperature .",

    "( b ) the temperature dependence of the angle @xmath33 between the spin axis and the stripe direction obtained from polarized - neutron analysis . ]    to fully analyze the direction of the spins over this temperature range we varied the direction of the neutron polarization * p * relative to the scattering vector * q * , measuring at the @xmath93 and @xmath94 positions .",
    "the method is described in ref , where the expressions used to obtain the spin direction are given .",
    "a correction for the slightly non - ideal performance of the polarization elements of the instrument was calculated from the flipping ratio of 18 @xmath6 1 measured on the magnetic bragg peaks .",
    "polarization analysis of both the * q@xmath35 * and the * q@xmath19 * bragg peaks revealed that the moment lies in the @xmath4 plane to within 1@xmath7 in the temperature range @xmath95k . having established this , we subsequently assumed the @xmath85-axis component to be zero and analyzed the polarization at * q@xmath35 * to determine the in - plane moment . from this analysis we determined that the spins rotated from an angle of 37.7 @xmath6 0.3@xmath7 to the stripe direction at @xmath96",
    "= 71k to 52.3 @xmath6 0.2@xmath7 at @xmath96 = 2k , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polar](b ) .",
    "the transition occurs mainly between 10 and 20k , but slowly develops from below @xmath59k .",
    "we performed unpolarized neutron diffraction at equivalent * q@xmath35 * and * q@xmath19 * positions on the single crystals with @xmath97 and @xmath64 , using the instrument rita - ii at sinq .",
    "we found a similar behaviour to the @xmath5 results just described .",
    "in particular , the temperature dependence of the * q@xmath19 * = ( 0.645,0.645,0 ) magnetic bragg peak for @xmath10 , and of the * q@xmath19 * = ( 0.685,0.685,1 ) magnetic bragg peak for @xmath98 , both have a maximum similar to that shown in fig.[fig : polar](a ) for @xmath5 .",
    "by contrast , the intensities of the * q@xmath35 * bragg peaks are almost constant below 20 k. the temperature dependence of the * q@xmath19 * intensity is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : ritaii ] for both @xmath10 and @xmath64 .",
    "the drop in * q@xmath19 * intensity at low temperature implies a spin reorientation in @xmath64 and @xmath10 similar in nature to that in @xmath5 .",
    "unpolarized neutron diffraction can not accurately determine @xmath33 without a detailed analysis of the intensities of many diffraction peaks , but we can estimate @xmath99 from the drop in intensity of the * q@xmath19 * peak below @xmath62 @xmath100k and the value of @xmath33 for @xmath101 , assuming the ordered moment remains in the @xmath4 plane and fixed in magnitude in this temperature range .",
    "taking @xmath39 above @xmath62 for @xmath10,@xcite and using @xmath102 for @xmath64 ( based on the observations for @xmath5 at @xmath103 ) .",
    "we find @xmath99 @xmath104 for both @xmath97 and @xmath105 , similar to @xmath5 .",
    "there are differences and similarities between the spin reorientations reported here for @xmath17 = 0.275 , 0.37 and @xmath106 and those that occur for @xmath17 = 1/3,@xcite and @xmath107.@xcite in each case the spins rotate in the same sense , away from the stripe direction on cooling .",
    "the size of the reorientation in @xmath17 = 0.37 ( @xmath99 @xmath108 ) ( and more approximately in @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) is similar to that in @xmath17 = 1/3 ( @xmath99 @xmath109 ) , but smaller than in @xmath17= 1/2 ( @xmath99 @xmath110 ) .",
    "however , in @xmath111 and @xmath11 the spin reorientation occurs at a much lower temperature , @xmath62@xmath112k , compared with @xmath62 @xmath113k for @xmath17 = 1/3 and @xmath62 @xmath114k for @xmath17 = 1/2 .",
    "figure [ fig : sr ] summarises the variation of @xmath62 with @xmath17 that has so far been established for the doping range @xmath115 .",
    "the results indicate that if there is no commensurate charge ordering the spin reorientation occurs @xmath63k , but if there is a commensurate charge ordering the spin reorientation occurs at @xmath59k .",
    "there is also evidence of a trend in the direction of the ordered moment .",
    "the base temperature spin orientations are @xmath116 for @xmath17= 1/3 , @xmath117 for @xmath5 , and @xmath118 for @xmath17= 1/2 , with charge ordering temperatures of @xmath119k , @xmath120k , @xmath121k respectively .",
    "we can add to this list an estimate of @xmath122 for @xmath10 , ( charge ordering temperature @xmath123 ) based on the angle of @xmath124 at 11 k found by lee _",
    "@xcite , with an additional @xmath125 due to the spin reorientation on cooling to 2k .",
    "hence , there seems to be a correlation between the spin orientation angle @xmath33 and the charge - ordering temperature .",
    "further measurements on samples with doping levels between @xmath64 and 0.5 would be useful to confirm this trend .    up to now ,",
    "spin reorientations in la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath51 had only been observed in materials with especially stable charge order ( @xmath42 and 1/2 ) .",
    "the existence of a spin reorientation in @xmath17 = 1/2 has shown that a commensurate spin - stripe order is not required for a spin reorientation to occur.@xcite the new results on @xmath17 = 0.275 , 0.37 and 0.4 presented here further show that not even commensurate doping is required .",
    "it is likely that lsno at all doping levels in the range @xmath115 undergo a spin reorientation , but that @xmath62 is larger at the commensurate doping compositions .",
