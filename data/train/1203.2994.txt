    "a number of relaxed , cool - core clusters are hosts to faint , diffuse radio emission with a radius comparable to the size of the cooling region ( @xmath6  100 - 300  kpc ) and a steep spectrum ( @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ) .",
    "these sources , called mini - halos , are relatively rare , with currently only around 10 clusters with confirmed detections .",
    "examples include perseus @xcite , a2029 @xcite , ophiuchus @xcite , rxc j1504.1 - 0248 @xcite , and rxj 1347 - 1145 @xcite , to name a few . questions still remain about the physical properties and the origin of these sources .",
    "though clusters hosting mini - halos have central active galaxies , they are not sufficient by themselves to power the diffuse radio emission .",
    "the radiative timescale of the electrons at the required energies for the observed emission ( @xmath9  years ) is much shorter than the time required for these electrons to diffuse across the cooling region @xcite .",
    "two physical mechanisms have been identified as possibly responsible for the radio emission : reacceleration of pre - existing , low - energy electrons in the intracluster medium ( icm ) by turbulence in the core region @xcite , and the generation of secondary particles via inelastic collisions between relativistic cosmic - ray protons and thermal protons @xcite .    in the reacceleration model ,",
    "the seed electrons may be provided by buoyant bubbles inflated by the central agn and disrupted by gas motions in the core . in the absence of a reacceleration mechanism , electrons in such disrupted bubbles cool rapidly and",
    "emit at radio frequencies well below those currently observable .",
    "however , a key question is the origin of the turbulence responsible for reaccelerating the electrons .",
    "@xcite originally proposed that the cooling flow of gas inward in the core may generate turbulence .",
    "however , recent x - ray observations indicate that , while `` cooling flows '' as envisioned in @xcite probably do not materialize , even relatively relaxed clusters have large - scale gas motions in their cores .",
    "the observational signature of these gas motions are the spiral - shaped `` cold fronts '' seen in the majority of cool - core clusters ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "these cold fronts are believed to be produced by the cold gas of the core `` sloshing '' in the cluster s deep potential well .",
    "@xcite showed that sloshing motions can produce significant turbulence in the cluster core .",
    "@xcite discovered spatial correlations between radio mini - halo emission and cold fronts in the x - ray images of two clusters  the minihalos apparently contained within the region delineated by the cold fronts .",
    "a similar correlation is seen in the perseus cluster ( markevitch & churazov 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "these authors suggested the correlation arises from turbulence generated by the sloshing motions , a hypothesis that we test in this work .",
    "figure [ fig : rxj1720 ] shows a particularly striking example of this in the cluster rxj1720.1 + 26 , clearly showing that the radio emission of the minihalo is bounded by the cold fronts as seen in x - rays .    in the last few years , a suite of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of idealized cluster mergers have been carried out to test the sloshing scenario for the origin of the cold fronts in cool cores ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter am06 ) , determine the physical effects of sloshing on the cluster thermal gas and magnetic field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zmj10 and zml11 ) , and make comparisons to observations of specific clusters with sloshing cold fronts @xcite .",
    "for the first time , we use a high - resolution numerical simulation to examine the connection between gas sloshing and radio minihalos in clusters .",
    "our simulation models the cool , magnetized core gas sloshing in the gravitational potential well of a massive , initially relaxed galaxy cluster , similar to the previous works mentioned above . using a filtering procedure similar to that employed in studies of turbulence in a cosmological context @xcite",
    ", we have determined that the sloshing motions generate turbulence in the cluster cool core that is spatially contained within the volume of the cold fronts .    to test the predictions of the reacceleration model for minihalos",
    ", we have included in the simulation a population of passive tracer particles to provide a lagrangian description of the sloshing gas .",
    "these particles provide us with the ability to follow relativistic electrons associated with a parcel of magnetized fluid , integrating the change in their energies determined by the fluid properties ( in particular , the local turbulent velocity ) along each tracer particle s trajectory .",
    "the connection between turbulent velocity and the acceleration of electrons is treated in a `` subgrid '' way  we use the prescription from @xcite , which is detailed in section [ sec : elec_accel ] .",
    "given the spatial and spectral distribution of relativistic electrons along with the magnetic field of the cluster , we produce maps of simulated synchrotron emission that may be compared to observations of actual mini - halos . our simulation can also be exploited for evaluating the relative importance of particle reacceleration and cosmic ray - thermal proton collisions for the origin of minihalos , which will be discussed in a future paper ( zuhone et al 2012 , in preparation ) .    this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the mhd simulation and the treatment of turbulence . in section 3 , we describe the treatment of relativistic particles . in section 4",
    ", we describe the characteristics of the turbulence that develops in the cluster core , and based on them , estimate the reacceleration coefficients . in section 5 ,",
    "we detail the evolution of the relativistic electrons and the resulting synchrotron and inverse - compton emission . finally , in sections 6 and 7 , we discuss and summarize our results and future developments of this work . we have assumed a flat @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 = 0.7 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "in our simulation we solve the ideal mhd equations . written in conservation form in gaussian units , they are : @xmath14 = \\rho{\\bf g \\cdot v } \\\\ \\frac{\\partial{\\bf b}}{\\partial{t } } + \\nabla \\cdot ( { \\bf vb } - { \\bf bv } ) = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gas pressure , and @xmath17 is the gas internal energy per unit volume .",
    "we assume an ideal equation of state with @xmath18 .",
    "we performed our simulation using flash 3 , a parallel hydrodynamics/@xmath19-body astrophysical simulation code developed at the center for astrophysical thermonuclear flashes at the university of chicago @xcite .",
    "flash uses adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) , a technique that places higher resolution elements of the grid only where they are needed .",
    "we are interested in capturing sharp icm features like shocks and cold fronts accurately , as well as resolving the inner cores of the cluster dark matter halos .",
    "it is particularly important to be able to resolve the grid adequately in these regions .",
    "amr allows us to do so without needing to have the whole grid at the same resolution .",
    "flash 3 solves the equations of magnetohydrodynamics using a directionally unsplit staggered mesh algorithm ( usm ; * ? ? ?",
    "the usm algorithm used in flash 3 is based on a finite - volume , high - order godunov scheme combined with a constrained transport method ( ct ) , which guarantees that the evolved magnetic field satisfies the divergence - free condition @xcite . in our simulations",
    ", the order of the usm algorithm corresponds to the piecewise - parabolic method ( ppm ) of @xcite , which is ideally suited for capturing shocks and contact discontinuties ( such as the cold fronts that appear in our simulations ) .    the gravitational potential on the grid",
    "is set up as the sum of two `` rigid bodies '' corresponding to the contributions to the potential from both clusters .",
    "this approach to the modeling the potential is used for simplicity and speed over solving the poisson equation for the matter distribution , and is an adequate approximation for our purposes .",
    "the details of this setup may be found in @xcite .",
    "a comparison between the rigid - potential and fully - modeled self - gravitating setups for the dark matter components of merging clusters ( and a justification of using the former method for this work ) may be found in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the details of our initial setup of the icm model and the magnetic field . here",
    "we sketch only briefly the details of the simulation performed in this work .",
    "our initial conditions consist of a massive ( @xmath20  kev ) cool - core galaxy cluster , and a smaller ( @xmath21 ) gasless subcluster , separated at an initial distance @xmath22 = 3  mpc , an initial impact parameter @xmath23 = 500  kpc , and placed on a bound mutual orbit ( the core passage occurs at @xmath24  gyr in our adopted time frame ) .",
    "the size of the computational domain is @xmath25 = 2  mpc , with a finest cell size of @xmath26 = 1  kpc .",
    "the maximum resolution covers a spherical region of @xmath27  kpc , centered on the dm peak of the main cluster , which encompasses all of the phenomena of interest in this study .",
    "the icm of the main cluster is magnetized , which is set up initially with a tangled magnetic field configuration with an average magnetic pressure proportional to the gas pressure , with @xmath28 .",
    "this choice is consistent with constraints put on the radial profiles of the magnetic field by faraday rotation measurements @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "this initial magnetic field configuration is not relaxed , and the differences in magnetic pressure and tension will generate spurious turbulent velocities @xmath29  km  s@xmath1 in the gas . to examine exclusively the turbulence generated by the sloshing motions , we modeled our main cluster in isolation for @xmath30  gyr , increasing the numerical viscosity during this period to damp out the motions until they are relatively small ( @xmath31  km  s@xmath1 ) and the magnetic field has reached a relaxed configuration",
    ". the gas density and temperature profiles of the main cluster are largely unaffected , with the largest deviations from the initial profiles of @xmath32 in the central few zones , immaterial for our purposes .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite shows the initial and final profiles of the main cluster .",
    "finally , our mhd simulation includes passive tracer particles flowing with the icm .",
    "these particles will be used to model the effects of reacceleration and energy losses on relativistic electrons traveling along these trajectories ( see [ sec : elec_accel ] ) .",
    "tracer particles are stored at intervals of 10  myr and from these snapshots the individual particle trajectories are extracted .",
    "the entire simulation contains approximately 10 million passive tracer particles initially distributed with their number density proportional to the local gas density .    for the details of the process of gas",
    "sloshing in galaxy cluster cores , e.g. how it is initiated , the formation of sloshing cold fronts , and its effects on the magnetic field , we refer the reader to past simulation works on sloshing @xcite .",
    "we assume these results in the following discussions .",
    "we are assuming in this work that relativistic electrons are reaccelerated by turbulence .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the acceleration rate in our simulations , we must determine the magnitude and location of turbulence .",
    "since not all motions in the icm are turbulent ( and not all turbulent motions efficiently accelerate particles ) , a distinction must be made between `` bulk '' or `` laminar '' flows and turbulent motions .",
    "substructures and mergers will drive motions in the gas on the scale of the merging subclusters that are not turbulent in nature .",
    "this applies to our isolated binary cluster merger simulations , where the most significant non - turbulent motion is the sloshing of the cool core , with sharp cold fronts and tangential velocity discontinuities .",
    "its contribution to the overall velocity power spectrum needs to be properly filtered out to examine the turbulent motions alone .",
    "this typically involves some process of spatial averaging , where the bulk motions are filtered out and only the turbulent ( small - scale , random ) component remains .",
    "however , the choice of a region to average over is often a judgment call .",
    "the simplest approaches typically take the average velocity of the cluster as a whole @xcite , or compute the average in concentric radial shells @xcite , none of which is sufficient for us in the presence of sloshing motions",
    ".    one successful choice of averaging , known as the `` local mean velocity field '' technique , has been applied in both sph and amr hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with success in separating the turbulent and bulk velocity fields in clusters where both kinds of motions are significant .",
    "this technique involves dividing the computational domain into `` boxes '' over which the average velocity is obtained , and the mean velocity local to a point in space is interpolated from these boxes and subtracted from the total velocity field to yield the turbulent component of the velocity field .",
    "following these previous works , we use the following simple prescription to estimate the turbulence in our simulations .",
    "we begin by setting up a coarse 3d uniform grid of cubical boxes of width @xmath33 that spans the entire simulation domain . within each box ,",
    "a mean velocity is computed from the cells on the flash adaptive grid contained in that box . at any point in the simulation , a local mean velocity field @xmath34",
    "may be constructed by interpolation from these boxes via a `` triangle - shaped cloud '' ( tsc ) window function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a schematic illustration of this procedure is given in figure [ fig : interpolation ] ) . from this local mean field",
    ", we may compute a local `` filtered '' turbulent field @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting turbulent velocity field is a conservative estimate of the field that may arise in a real cluster merger such as the one we are simulating .",
    "the tsc interpolation will filter out turbulent modes with scales larger than the box size @xmath33 .",
    "additionally , the dissipation scale where the energy in the turbulent cascade is dissipated into heat is set not by the actual viscosity of the icm but by the resolution of our simulation , which results in a dissipation scale of several times the cell size .",
    "thus , the power of turbulence that we measure in our simulations is a lower bound to that which may be expected in a real cluster merger .",
    "we will address this point in detail in section [ sec : turb_char ] .",
    "we will also discuss a separation of turbulent motions into compressive and solenoidal components in section [ sec : turb_coeff ] .",
    "the reacceleration model for radio halos assumes a population of relativistic electrons already present in the icm , which are reaccelerated by turbulence , e.g. that generated by sloshing motions . in our simulation model , we assume that relativistic electrons are advected along with the fluid , so we may use our tracer particle trajectories to determine the effect of the properties of the fluid along each trajectory on the energies of the relativistic electrons .",
    "we do this by performing a set of post - processing `` simulations '' on the tracer particle trajectories .",
    "there is a sufficient number of tracer particles to sample the cool core very well .",
    "a similar post - processing approach was used to study simulated gas mixing , metal distribution , and iron line profiles in a set of clusters drawn from a cosmological simulation in @xcite .      in order to compute the synchrotron emission for each tracer particle as a function of time ,",
    "it is necessary to model the energy distribution of relativistic electrons @xmath36 that may be initialized and evolved for each tracer particle along its trajectory .",
    "a rigorous approach to this problem would be to integrate a fokker - planck equation for @xmath36 along each trajectory , with @xmath36 sampled discretely in bins of electron energy .",
    "this approach would provide a complete description of the relativistic particle diffusion in momentum space as well as systematic energy gain and losses . while feasible in the near future , this approach is beyond the current state of software development for our code , and we chose to adopt a simpler method .",
    "instead , the distribution of relativistic electrons @xmath36 is discretely sampled in a `` monte carlo '' fashion with a large number of `` relativistic particles '' for each tracer particle .",
    "the distinction between these two methods is similar to the distinction between eulerian grid - based methods versus lagrangian particle - based methods ( smooth - particle hydrodynamics ) for solving the equations of hydrodynamics . in the latter case",
    ", the individual gas particles do not represent any real concentrations of gas _ per se _ , but are simply discrete lagrangian samples of the distribution function of the gas ; similarly , the relativistic particles are not electrons but merely sample the underlying distribution .",
    "each relativistic particle has a lorentz factor @xmath37 that represents the average relativistic energy @xmath38 for the sample @xmath39 for the tracer particle @xmath40 .",
    "the energy disribution function @xmath41 for each tracer particle @xmath40 may be written as : @xmath42 where the sum is taken over the number of samples for the tracer particle and @xmath43 is a normalization constant . to get a proper scaling for the total energy in relativistic electrons , as our default case we assume",
    "the initial energy density in relativistic electrons of each tracer particle is proportional to the tracer particle s associated thermal energy ( that is , assuming the uniform initial ratio of relativistic electron to thermal pressures ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the internal energy per unit mass of the thermal gas and each tracer particle has a gas mass @xmath46 associated with it , such that the total gas mass of particles equals the total mass in gas on the grid within the region under consideration .",
    "this condition sets the normalization constant @xmath43 .",
    "the results in this work only depend on @xmath47 as a normalization constant , so we will express electron energies and radiative quantities in terms of @xmath47 , but we assume a default value of @xmath48 to compare the results of our numerical simulations to observations .    we generate a physically plausible initial spectrum of relativistic electrons by taking a power - law spectrum with index @xmath49 ( defined as @xmath50 ) and passively evolving it for 1  gyr under the constant conditions of @xmath51  @xmath52 and @xmath53 g , representative values for the cluster core regions in this model .",
    "the result is a spectrum that has significantly cooled , with essentially no electrons at energies higher than @xmath54 .",
    "this initial distribution of electrons has no significant emission at observable radio wavelengths .",
    "we assign this spectrum to each tracer particle at @xmath55  gyr . at this epoch ,",
    "the characteristic size of the sloshing region is approximately 4@xmath56  kpc , and by beginning the relativistic electron evolution at this point , we hope to minimize contamination to our derived turbulent spectrum from bulk motions .",
    "this is also roughly the epoch at which turbulence begins to be significant ( section [ sec : turb_char ] ) .    as a starting point",
    ", we also assume that the number density of relativistic electrons is proportional to the density of thermal electrons ( however , in section [ sec : different_space ] , we will discuss alternative initial spatial distributions of particles ) .",
    "since our tracer particles are advected with the thermal gas and represent parcels of constant gas mass , this simply implies that the number of relativistic electrons per tracer particle remains constant . for the results presented here",
    ", we generated 10@xmath57 relativistic particles for each tracer particle .",
    "we select only certain tracer particles for consideration instead of using all of them contained within the simulation volume .",
    "our default case begins with the tracer particles filling a large region of radius @xmath58 = 300  kpc in the initial undisturbed cluster , covering the region that will eventually contain sloshing and cold fronts .",
    "the critical component of the model for radio mini - halos is the reacceleration of relativistic particles by mhd turbulence .",
    "relativistic particles interacting with mhd turbulence are subject to several mechanisms that lead to their acceleration , both through resonant and non - resonant coupling with turbulent waves . in the case of compressible mhd turbulence generated at large scales in the icm ,",
    "@xcite have shown that reacceleration is accomplished primarily by the damping of fast magnetosonic waves through the transit - time damping ( ttd ) resonance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the condition for which is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the frequency of the magnetosonic wave , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the parallel ( projected along @xmath63 ) wavenumber and particle speed , respectively .",
    "to compute the momentum - diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons due to ttd resonance , we use equation 40 from @xcite ( assuming the mode phase velocity @xmath64 ) , where the spectrum of compressive modes is calculated self - consistently by taking into account the effect of dampings due to ttd with thermal and relativistic particles : @xmath65 in the integral over @xmath66 , @xmath67 specifies the wavenumber corresponding to the scale of the largest turbulent eddies and @xmath68 specifies the wavenumber corresponding to the minimum scale of turbulence where the timescale of dampings equals that of the turbulent cascade .",
    "@xmath69 is the electron momentum , @xmath70 is the local magnetic field , @xmath71 is the heaviside step function , and the spectrum of the magnetic field fluctuations associated with the compressive modes @xmath72 is @xmath73 where the quantity in brackets @xmath74 is averaged with respect to @xmath75 and is of order unity . noting that @xmath76 , equation [ eqn : dpp1 ] may be simplified to @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the integral over @xmath75 and is of order a few .",
    "the integral over @xmath66 may be rearranged to give @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the average wavenumber of the turbulent cascade as measured in the simulation , @xmath81 is the turbulent velocity of the tracer particle , and @xmath82 is the fraction of the turbulent energy in the form of compressible motions .",
    "the last equality follows from the definition of the power spectrum .",
    "the scaling of fast modes with wavenumber @xmath66 is of kraichnan form , with @xmath83 @xcite , as opposed to the purely hydrodynamic kolmogorov scaling of @xmath84 .",
    "we will assume this form for the power spectrum of the turbulent cascade throughout this paper .",
    "the mean wavenumber @xmath80 is then expressed in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath68 as : @xmath85    in cgs units , the resulting momentum - diffusion coefficient for the relativistic electrons via ttd is given by : @xmath86 fast particles diffusing in compressive mhd turbulence also experience statistical compression and expansion that leads to additional stochastic non - resonant acceleration . in the fast diffusion limit ,",
    "the momentum - diffusion coefficient is ( * ? ? ?",

    "* equation 56 ) : @xmath89 the two mechanisms , ttd resonance and non - resonant compression , are essentially driven by the same turbulent modes and involve independent particle - mode couplings .",
    "consequently , as a first approximation , the acceleration process may be thought of as the combination of the two mechanisms @xcite , with a total momentum - diffusion coefficient @xmath90 .",
    "each relativistic particle has a reacceleration efficiency of @xmath91 so that the rate of momentum increase for each relativistic particle is @xmath92 we will detail the assumptions that go into the computation of the reacceleration coefficient in our simulations in section [ sec : turb_coeff ] , in particular , the evaluation of @xmath80 , @xmath82 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the rate of energy losses due to synchrotron and inverse - compton scattering off of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons for individual electrons is ( in cgs units ) : @xmath93\\\\ & = & -\\frac{\\beta{p}^2}{m_ec }   \\label{eqn : radloss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since our relativistic particles are not individual electrons but samples of the electron distribution function ( and hence represent many electrons ) , we assume for simplicity that each relativistic particle represents an isotropic distribution of pitch angles , with @xmath94 .",

    "@xmath105 there is a corresponding stochastic differential equation ( sde ) for the evolution of @xmath107 for an ensemble of sample particles . by following the momentum trajectories of many sample particles , we may reliably approximate the behavior of @xmath105 and the observable quantities that depend on it , such as the resultant synchrotron and ic emission .",
    "sdes have been used extensively in other astrophysical contexts , in particular , for the integration of cosmic ray trajectories in the heliospheric and galactic magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the main differences between our approach and many of these works is that a ) we are only integrating the momentum of each particle as the relativistic particles are assumed to follow the tracer particle trajectories in space , and b ) we are integrating the equations forward in time instead of backwards to the original source of particles .    the sde that corresponds to the above fokker - planck equation is given ( in the it@xmath108 formulation ) by : @xmath109 where the `` drift '' term is @xmath110 and the `` stochastic '' term is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a standard wiener ( or `` brownian motion '' ) process , and @xmath113 is a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance ( the `` @xmath2 '' symbol here indicates `` is distributed as '' ) .",
    "the effects of each of these terms on the relativistic electron spectrum will be shown in the appendix .",
    "we have integrated the drift term of this equation using a 4th - order runge - kutta method .",
    "to integrate the stochastic term , we use the milstein method @xcite .",

    ", they are linearly interpolated between the saved instances of each particle along that trajectory , which have a time resolution of 10  myr . in the appendix",
    "we provide tests of our method when compared to analytical solutions and the results of a fokker - planck calculation",
    ". a detailed description of the method and the code will be the subject of a future paper ( zuhone et al 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "in the sloshing / reacceleration hypothesis for radio mini - halos that we are testing in this work , the radio emission coincident with the envelope of the cold fronts as seen in x - rays is due to the turbulence that is associated with the sloshing motions .",
    "figure [ fig : temp_map ] shows the spiral shape in temperature that results from the sloshing motions for a few different epochs of the simulation .",
    "we now determine the location and spectrum of turbulence that results from the encounter with the subcluster .",
    "we note at the outset that a very recent work @xcite , using an improved filtering technique , produced turbulent velocity maps and power spectra for gas sloshing in the core of a galaxy cluster and achieved results in general agreement with those we present here .    separating out the turbulent energy component from the bulk component in a simulation of gas sloshing is a challenge , mainly due to the presence of the sloshing motions themselves .",
    "strong velocity shears and discontinuities exist at the cold front surfaces , and tracer particles situated near these surfaces will have a mean velocity interpolated to them that is a weighted sum of the velocities across the front , resulting in some of the bulk component of the particle s velocity remaining after the spatial filtering procedure",
    ". therefore , tracer particles that travel near these surfaces may have their turbulent kinetic energy overestimated , which we should find a way to avoid .    in our merger setup , where the subcluster s trajectory is in the @xmath118 plane ,",
    "most of the kinetic energy associated with the sloshing motions is in the @xmath119 and @xmath120 components of the velocity field .",
    "it is in these directions in which it will be most difficult to filter out the contribution to the total velocity at a particle position from the sloshing motions . at the same time",
    ", we expect that the vast majority of the kinetic energy associated with the @xmath121 velocity component is due to the turbulent cascade generated by the sloshing motions , since there is only a slow outward expansion of the cold fronts in the @xmath96-direction .",
    "we will use this simple observation to separate the turbulent component in our simulation .    to get a sense of the location of the tubulence in our simulations , we create projected maps of the mass - weighted turbulent velocity : @xmath122^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where the integrals are taken along the line of sight .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : vels ] shows the projected mass - weighted total velocity at the epoch @xmath123  gyr , @xmath21.7  gyr after the subcluster core passage , for a few different choices of the filtering box size @xmath33 .",
    "there is a clear distinction between the core region bounded by the sloshing cold fronts and the region outside ; inside this region , @xmath124  km  s@xmath1 , while outside the cold fronts , @xmath125  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "however , the highest values of projected @xmath126 appear to be near the cold front surfaces , which is to be expected from the preceding discussion . the speed of these motions increases with increasing box size @xmath33 , as the larger box size permits larger - scale flows to be interpreted as `` turbulent '' by the filtering scheme .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : vels ] shows the projected mass - weighted @xmath96-component of velocity at the same epoch @xmath123  gyr , for the same choices of the filtering box size @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", there is still a clear distinction between the sloshing core region and the outside region of the simulation domain .",

    "electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds by agn and generated as byproducts of collisions of relativistic protons with the thermal protons of the icm .",
    "the former process will result in relativistic electrons preferentially located in agn - blown bubbles , and the latter will produce more relativistic electrons in regions of high gas density throughout the cluster .",
    "the appearance of a mini - halo generated by sloshing may depend on the initial spatial distribution of these particles .",
    "our already examined case of a large spherical distribution of relativistic particles represents the second possibility mentioned above . in order",
    "to approximately represent a population of seed electrons produced by an agn , we perform three simulations of relativistic electrons originating in two `` bubbles '' . in these cases , it order to produce radio emission that follows the x - ray cold fronts , it will not only be necessary for electrons to be reaccelerated by the turbulence , but the sloshing motions will have to adequately redistribute the seed electrons throughout this region .    since modeling the dynamics of the relativistic agn bubbles is far beyond our current scope , we perform a simple exercise that tests whether or not the relativistic particles may be adequately redistributed by the sloshing motions to fill the core region .",
    "we first assume that the relativistic particles contained in the bubbles have just become mixed in with the thermal gas at the epoch @xmath98 = 1.95  gyr ( before the beginning of the sloshing motions ) , and then identify tracer particles contained within two symmetric 30  kpc `` bubbles '' centered around the cluster potential minimum ( without attempting to evacuate thermal gas from these `` bubbles '' , as would be the case in real clusters ) . each of these particles are assumed to contain the same mass of gas @xmath46 as before , but there are far fewer of them than in our default spatial case , with approximately @xmath229 tracer particles per bubble .",
    "we then follow these particles for 0.6  gyr , and at @xmath98 = 2.55  gyr , we assign them relativistic particle distributions identical to that of our default case . we perform three simulations of the evolution of the relativistic particles from these initial distributions , with the axis of the bubbles aligned along the @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath96 axes ( keeping in mind that in our simulation , sloshing occurs in the @xmath118 plane .",
    "figure [ fig : particle_positions ] shows the evolution of particle positions between the epochs @xmath98 = 1.95  gyr and 2.55  gyr for our three bubble initial conditions .",
    "regardless of the initial orientation of the bubbles , we find that the sloshing motions redistribute the gas particles so that most of them end up within the spiral shape traced out by the cold fronts .",
    "figure [ fig : bubble_emission ] shows the projected gas temperature in the @xmath96-direction of the simulation with 327  mhz radio contours overlaid at the epoch @xmath98 = 2.95  gyr for two simulations where `` bubbles '' of relativistic particles have been injected .",
    "we find that faint radio emission is produced in all three cases , and it is contained within the core of the sloshing region .",
    "although the particles have been redistributed throughout the sloshing region , only a fraction of them have encountered regions of strong turbulence , fewer than in the case where we assumed relativistic particles were originally distributed proportional to gas density everywhere within the core .",
    "if we assume that a population of low-@xmath230 electrons is built up over time in the core by injection from the central agn and then mixing by sloshing motions , then we may end up with a situation similar to our default case for the spatial distribution of relativistic electrons , which succeeded in reproducing the observed mini - halo properties .",
    "this lends support to the hypothesis that mini - halos may be generated by electrons which originated from the central agn and are reaccelerated by sloshing motions . sloshing and agn are both commonly found in cool - core clusters where mini - halos are found .",
    "additionally , as pointed out by @xcite , in the cool cores of galaxy clusters relativistic electrons will be efficiently produced by hadronic processes due to the high density of thermal protons . between the agn and hadronic interactions ,",
    "the dense cores of clusters should contain adequate numbers of seed relativistic electrons to be reaccelerated by turbulence .",
    "it is instructive to examine the energy budget of the various components of our model as they evolve during the simulation .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig : evolving_energies ] shows the evolution of the total kinetic , turbulent kinetic , magnetic , and relativistic electron energies relative to the total thermal energy of the tracer particles initially within a radius of 100  kpc from the cluster center .",
    "the largest contribution is that of the total kinetic energy , which stays around @xmath23 - 4% over time , followed by the magnetic energy at @xmath21% and the turbulent kinetic energy at @xmath20.5% .",
    "the relativistic electron energy density starts at our initial value of @xmath231 and decreases as most of the electrons cool over time ",
    "the high-@xmath230 tail of the electron distribution that is studied here does not contribute much to the total electron energy .",
    "all of the separate nonthermal energy categories combined contribute less than 10% to the total energy budget .",
    "this is in part a consequence of the specialized initial conditions of our setup , which began with only thermal , magnetic , and a small amount of kinetic energy ( due to our relaxation procedure , see section [ sec : mhd_sims ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the cosmological simulation results of @xcite , who show that for cores of relaxed clusters , the contribution to the total pressure from turbulence , rotation , and streaming gas motions is negligible compared to the thermal pressure , as well as recent constraints placed on turbulent motions in the core of abell 1835 by @xcite , and in abell 3112 by @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the energies of the tracer particles that are emitting the most synchrotron radiation .",
    "these particles will be the ones that have encountered the highest turbulent velocities , as can be seen by the correspondences between the regions of brightest synchrotron emission ( figures [ fig : contours_z]-[fig : contours_y ] ) and the locations with the strongest turbulence ( figures [ fig : proj_z]-[fig : proj_x ] ) . to isolate these regions ,",
    "we select only those tracer particles that will reach an average energy @xmath232 at any point in the simulation and emit at frequencies @xmath233  100  mhz , at which the halos are presently observed .",
    "these particles comprise 1% of the total number of tracer particles of our initial set ; their energy ratios are shown by the dashed lines of figure [ fig : evolving_energies ] .",
    "the synchrotron emission indeed highlights regions with slightly higher turbulent energies and ( by virtue of their selection ) nearly an order of magnitude higher relativistic electron energy contribution .",
    "we can also determine the energy gained by relativistic particles through turbulent acceleration . though we have not modeled self - consistently the interaction between the relativistic particles and the turbulent icm ( in particular their back - reaction on turbulence ) , for the reacceleration model to be a viable mechanism for generating mini - halos , the energy gain by relativistic particles should be a small fraction of the turbulent energy . to do this , we need to compare the rate of energy gained by the relativistic electrons versus the rate of energy that passes through the turbulent cascade toward the dissipation scale",
    ". the former rate will not be equal to the total change in energy in relativistic particles , as most of the energy gained ( especially for the highest - energy electrons ) will end up in the form of synchrotron and hard x - ray emission , but we know from equation [ eqn : dpp8 ] how much energy the electrons in our simulations gain . to get a rough determination of the ratio of these two quantities ,",
    "we compute the former via equation [ eqn : dpp7 ] , and the latter via the estimate for the turbulent energy cascade rate ( equation 48 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath234 where @xmath33 = 30  kpc and the constant @xmath235 .",
    "in making this estimate we have used the average turbulent mach number @xmath236 and sound speed @xmath237 . the ratio of these rates for all the tracer particles and the high-@xmath230 tracer particles is also shown in figure [ fig : evolving_energies ] .",
    "the rate of energy gain of the relativistic particles is typically @xmath210@xmath238 of the turbulent cascade rate .    as a consistency check",
    ", we check the ratio of the rate of the turbulent energy cascade rate to the cooling rate of the thermal gas by x - rays .",
    "we find that the rate of turbulent dissipation is at the level of @xmath210@xmath239 of the bolometric x - ray luminosity , however , this estimate is probably uncertain by an order of magnitude , since we have made an approximate estimate of the turbulent cascade rate due to our inability to measure this quantity from the simulation directly .",
    "thus , this quantity is probably overestimated ; a consequence of which is that the efficiency of reacceleration relative to the turbulent cascade rate is likely to be somewhat higher than this estimate indicates .",
    "in general , only a fraction of the energy of turbulence is drained into relativistic particles via turbulent reacceleration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . consequently , even if we have not considered the case of cosmic ray protons that could be present in the cluster core region , the additional energy input that would be acquired by these pre - existing protons via acceleration due to sloshing - driven turbulence in our simulation is @xmath2401% of the thermal energy , regardless of the initial energy content of the pre - existing protons .",
    "a energy content of cosmic ray protons at percent level of the thermal gas is still consistent with present upper limits from gamma - ray observations ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      from our simulations",
    ", we discern two effects of the gas sloshing on the relativistic electrons that are important for the formation of mini - halos .",
    "the first is the reacceleration itself . without reacceleration ,",
    "the electrons will simply cool down to energies below which they are incapable of emitting at observable synchrotron frequencies . with reacceleration ,",
    "the electrons inside the sloshing region are maintained for a significant period of time ( @xmath21  gyr from the onset of sloshing ) at high enough @xmath230 for radio emission to be produced ( see figure [ fig : electron_accel ] ) .",
    "the second important effect of sloshing concerns the initial spatial distribution of the electrons .",
    "sloshing motions can take rather general initial spatial distributions of relativistic electrons and redistribute them throughout the sloshing region .",
    "thus , we anticipate that for reasonable seed populations of relativistic electrons ( either resulting from hadronic interactions or injected by agn ) , sloshing should be able to redistribute and reaccelerate them so that radio mini - halo emission is produced .",
    "as previously mentioned , sloshing also amplifies magnetic fields within the cluster core , an effect that is also important for hadronic / secondary models @xcite .",
    "some mini - halos in observed galaxy clusters with attendant sloshing cold fronts have a very specific morphology  they are very similar to the shape of the sloshing region and bounded by the cold fronts as seen in x - rays @xcite .",
    "however , other mini - halos do not appear to be coincident with sloshing cold fronts @xcite , and some of them appear in clusters without discernable sloshing",
    ". however , turbulence generated by sloshing may still be the origin of the radio emitting electrons , even if the corresponding cold fronts are not seen .",
    "projection effects may make it difficult to associate mini - halos with cold fronts . in projections perpendicular to the plane of the mutual orbit of the main cluster and the subcluster , such as the @xmath96-projection of our simulations , a clear association of the radio emission with the shape of the cold front is observed .",
    "in other projections ( @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) , the spiral shape of the cold fronts is unobservable , though small portions of the cold fronts still appear . in these cases ,",
    "the emission is still bounded within this region , but it is more difficult to tell from the x - ray image if sloshing is present .",
    "larger cold fronts will also be more difficult to observe in x - rays due to their low surface brightness contrast . finally ,",
    "although the conditions necessary to generate the mini - halo emission may be associated with the sloshing cold fronts , it does not necessarily imply that these conditions prevail uniformly throughout the sloshing region .",
    "figures [ fig : proj_z ] through [ fig : proj_y ] show the turbulent kinetic energy exhibits strong variations throughout the cluster core . though the magnetic field strength is the strongest along the cold front surfaces , it also varies greatly inside them , also seen in figures [ fig : proj_z ] through [ fig : proj_y ] .",
    "these variations may combine to produce emission maps that do not always fill the entire region bounded by the cold fronts ( see figures [ fig : contours_z ] through [ fig : contours_y ] ) , particularly since the spatial scale of these variations is comparable to the size of the core region .      finally , it is important to summarize the various uncertainties involved in our model .",
    "the major sources of uncertainty arise from the assumptions of the initial energy in relativistic electrons and the assumptions involved in the estimates of the reacceleration coefficients .",
    "our initial electron spectrum depends on a number of conditions as detailed in section [ sec : elec_model ] .",
    "we have experimented with a few different initial electron spectra under otherwise identical simulation conditions , and have found that our results do not depend significantly on the initial spectral shape .",
    "all of our results related to the relativistic electron spectra , including our synchrotron and ic emission , may be scaled by the relativistic electron energy fraction @xmath47 .",
    "the hard x - ray constraints on the cluster ic emission allow values up to @xmath241 @xcite ; a value in equipartition with the magnetic field energy would also be @xmath241 ; thus our use of @xmath48 is very conservative .",
    "the reacceleration coefficients @xmath181 and @xmath182 in our model are dependent upon the characteristics of the power spectrum of turbulence , in particular the minimum and maximum wavenumbers @xmath67 and @xmath242 , and the ratio of power in compressible motions to the total power @xmath82 . while @xmath67 is determined by the size of the sloshing structures and",
    "can not be much different from our assumption , the value of @xmath68 represents an extension ( albeit a very plausible and likely conservative one ) by a factor of @xmath210 above the range of wavenumbers for the inertial regime in our simulations .",
    "if our @xmath68 is an overestimate , we subsequently overestimate @xmath243 and the reacceleration coefficient @xmath244 by a factor of @xmath2  a few .",
    "conversely , if the turbulent cascade extends down to smaller scales in the manner of @xcite , we have underestimated @xmath68 by a factor of @xmath2  a few , and the reacceleration efficiency would be substantially underestimated .",
    "we already discussed the potential overestimate in @xmath164 due to the edge effects of the non - periodic subdomains in section [ sec : turb_coeff ] , which showed that up to @xmath230% of the compressive power is potentially spurious .",
    "however , the main uncertainty in @xmath82 arises from our adoption of an average value constant in space and time . in reality",
    ", the compressive component of turbulence will vary spatially and with time .",
    "our adoption of @xmath166 is a conservative one , since most of the reacceleration from turbulence will arise from regions with higher @xmath82 , which we found can be as high as 0.7 ( section [ sec : turb_coeff ] ) . in these regions ,",
    "the reacceleration due to turbulence is underestimated by a factor of a few .",
    "figure [ fig : different_dpp ] shows the effects of varying the coefficient @xmath243 by a small factor in either direction on the total electron spectrum of the simulation .",
    "decreasing @xmath243 by a factor of two results in a decrease of @xmath36 by an order of magnitude or more at @xmath245 .",
    "increasing @xmath243 by a factor of 1.5 results in an increase of @xmath36 by nearly an order of magnitude or more at @xmath245 .",
    "this demonstrates that the resulting electron spectrum is fairly sensitive to the value of @xmath243 at high @xmath230 .    due to the combined effects of these uncertainties ,",
    "our procedure must be regarded only as an order of magnitude estimate , which is suitable for the aim of the present paper .",
    "nevertheless , for the physically plausible choices we have made for these coefficients , our results are consistent with observations of minihalos .",
    "in this work , we have performed the first simulation test of the hypothesis that radio minihalos , sometimes observed in cluster cool cores , originate from relativistic electrons reaccelerated by turbulence generated by sloshing motions .",
    "the seed low-@xmath230 electrons are likely to remain , e.g. , from past agn activity and/or from hadronic interactions . the acceleration mechanisms that we considered are the damping of turbulence - induced magnetosonic waves on relativistic electrons and non - resonant compression , which are included in a subgrid fashion . our high - resolution , idealized simulation consists of a cool - core galaxy cluster with magnetized gas and an infalling gasless subcluster .",
    "the interaction between the subcluster and the core of the main cluster initiates gas sloshing in the core .",
    "two significant magnetohydrodynamic effects of the gas sloshing are the generation of turbulence and the amplification of magnetic fields , both of which occur within the region of the cool core bounded by the sloshing cold fronts .",
    "we have shown that in this model , faint , extended radio sources that closely resemble the spatial and spectral properties of the observed mini - halos may be generated under a variety of physically reasonable assumptions for the initial spatial distribution and input spectrum of seed relativistic electrons . the sloshing motions ",
    "bulk flows and turbulence  have two effects on the relativistic electrons , reacceleration and redistribution of seed relativistic electrons throughout the core .",
    "these two effects combine to produce radio emission that is diffuse , steep - spectrum , and that traces the spatial features of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the radio power generated in our model is in the range of that of observed minihalos ( though our assumption of the initial energy density of the relativistic electrons is rather uncertain ) .",
    "importantly , we have shown that minihalos produced by turbulent reacceleration are transient sources , particularly at high ( @xmath21  ghz ) frequencies , consistent with the small number of observed mini - halos .",
    "we have also shown that the x - ray inverse - compton emission produced by the same relativistic electrons will be difficult to observe due to the fact that the ic emission begins to dominate over the thermal emission of the bright core only at very high energies ( @xmath2100  kev ) .",
    "significant improvements could be made to bring our model more in line with observations .",
    "more sophisticated methods can be developed to better characterize the spectrum and normalization of turbulence created by sloshing ( such as the recent attempts in * ? ? ?",
    "a more accurate treatment of the evolution of the spectrum of relativistic electrons requires the use of a physical model for a time - dependent injection of these electrons .",
    "also , in our paper we do not consider the effect of cosmic ray protons in the sloshing region .",
    "self - consistent calculations of particle acceleration and of the resulting non - thermal emission should take into account also the proton component , since protons generate secondary electrons ( that eventually may be reaccelerated ) and can be important for the damping of the turbulence @xcite .",
    "finally , a variety of cluster initial conditions could be explored , to determine if mini - halo formation is more likely under certain merger conditions than others .",
    "we leave these considerations for future work .",
    "our simulation data could also be used to examine the hadronic hypothesis for mini - halos , and provide a point of comparison between the two models .",

    "<S> a number of relaxed , cool - core galaxy clusters exhibit diffuse , steep - spectrum radio sources in their central regions , known as radio mini - halos . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed that the relativistic electrons responsible for the emission have been reaccelerated by turbulence generated by the sloshing of the cool core gas . </S>",
    "<S> we present a high - resolution mhd simulation of gas sloshing in a galaxy cluster coupled with subgrid simulations of relativistic electron acceleration to test this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation shows that the sloshing motions generate turbulence on the order of @xmath0  50 - 200  km  s@xmath1 on spatial scales of @xmath250 - 100  kpc and below in the cool core region within the envelope of the sloshing cold fronts , whereas outside the cold fronts , there is negligible turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> this turbulence is potentially strong enough to reaccelerate relativistic electron seeds ( with initial @xmath3 ) to @xmath4 via damping of magnetosonic waves and non - resonant compression . </S>",
    "<S> the seed electrons could remain in the cluster from , e.g. , past agn activity . in combination with the magnetic field amplification in the core </S>",
    "<S> , these electrons then produce diffuse radio synchrotron emission that is coincident with the region bounded by the sloshing cold fronts , as indeed observed in x - rays and the radio . </S>",
    "<S> the result holds for different initial spatial distributions of preexisting relativistic electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the power and the steep spectral index ( @xmath5 ) of the resulting radio emission are consistent with observations of minihalos , though the theoretical uncertainties of the acceleration mechanisms are high . </S>",
    "<S> we also produce simulated maps of inverse - compton hard x - ray emission from the same population of relativistic electrons . </S>"
