    "the production of @xmath0 mesons in proton - proton collisions near threshold has been reported recently by the spesiii group at saturne@xcite and by cosy - j@xmath17lich@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 is observed as a missing mass peak by detecting both final protons in a magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the total cross section of the @xmath1 reaction is found to be a factor @xmath18 smaller than for the corresponding @xmath19 , indicating a similar production mechanisms for @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "the observation that the @xmath3 production rate is nearly as large as @xmath2 production rate is attributed to a dominant contribution from resonant production via virtual excitation of the n@xmath21 ( 1535 mev ) s11 nucleon isobar .    various phenomenological one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models for these processes have achieved impressive descriptions of extensive data from saclay@xcite , indiana@xcite , and uppsala @xcite .",
    "particularly , a relativistic covariant obe model , reproduces consistently the cross section data ( both scale and energy dependence ) for the @xmath19 and @xmath22 reactions@xcite .",
    "the main objective of the present note is to consider @xmath0 production by applying a slightly generalized model . as in ref.@xcite",
    "we assume a reaction mechanism as depicted in fig .",
    "1 , where a virtual boson b ( b= @xmath23 created on one of the incoming protons is converted into a pseudoscalar meson p ( @xmath24 ) on the second via a @xmath25 conversion process .",
    "the half off mass - shell amplitudes for these conversion processes , hereafter denoted by @xmath26 , are taken to be the sum of three pole terms corresponding to s , u , and t - channels ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . the latter accounts for meson production occurring on internal lines such as @xmath27 and @xmath7 meson lines , and requires knowledge about three meson legs vertices like @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 vertices .",
    "such mechanisms are considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an effective @xmath27-meson in a t channel , strongly enhanced due to offshellness , found to play a prominent role for @xmath2 production in the @xmath19 reaction at threshold . for @xmath20 production most relevant",
    "is a @xmath31 exchange .",
    "generally , both nucleon and nucleon isobar excitations intermediate states may contribute to diagrams 2a and 2b .",
    "such is the case for @xmath3 production , where production via exciation , propagation and subsequent decay of the n@xmath21 ( 1535 mev ) s11 isobar into a @xmath3n pair play a significant role in the process .",
    "we shall demonstrate below that cross section data for @xmath20 production can be explained without a resonant production term .",
    "much of the model success to explain meson production data in nn collisions depends on how well the half off mass shell amplitudes for the elementary conversion processes @xmath25 are calculated . unfortunately , there are no direct measurements which link directly to the off mass shell behavior of these amplitudes . in comparison with the @xmath22 reaction ,",
    "the momentum transfer in @xmath1 is nearly twice as large and it would be of interest to verify that the off shell behavior presumed reproduces @xmath0 production rate as well .",
    "there are some near threshold cross section data for the @xmath32 reactions@xcite . here as for production in nn collisions the cross sections depart by more than an order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "it is to be shown that taken on mass shell , the amplitudes @xmath33 reproduce the cross sections for the quasielastic processes @xmath34 and @xmath35 at their respective thresholds .",
    "to account for the production of @xmath0 meson , we slightly generalize the lagrangian of refs .",
    "@xcite , by including a lagrangian density , @xmath36 where n and @xmath0 represent the fields of a nucleon and an @xmath0 meson .",
    "further more , in order to allow @xmath0 formation on an internal @xmath7-meson line we write the @xmath37 vertex in a rather general form@xcite , @xmath38 this expression is similar to the @xmath29 vertex used in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) production , where the vertex constants @xmath39 were deduced from the partial decay width for @xmath40 , and by applying the three adler s consistency conditions to the @xmath41 amplitude@xcite .",
    "there is no direct experimental information about the strength of the @xmath0 couplings .",
    "however , being the heaviest member of the ground state pseudoscalar meson nonet , the @xmath0 couplings can be related to those of the @xmath3 . in the quark model the @xmath3nn and @xmath0nn couplings are@xcite , @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the mixing angle , singlet and octet couplings , respectively . by making the simplifying assumption @xmath44 , and taking a linear mixing angle@xcite , @xmath8 ,",
    "one obtains , @xmath45 similarly , the @xmath29 and @xmath37 vertex constants scale also according to eq .",
    "[ ratio ] . with the relevant @xmath3 couplings taken from ref.@xcite and disregarding uncertainties in @xmath46 one obtains @xmath47    the @xmath3 meson couples rather strongly to the n@xmath21 ( 1535 mev ) s11 and to a lesser extent to the n@xmath21 ( 1710 mev ) p11 resonances .",
    "particularly , the resonance mass almost coincides with the mass of a @xmath3 n pair so that contributions from graphs 2a and 2b with nucleon isobar excitations become prominent near the @xmath3 production threshold .",
    "there are no evidence for strong couplings of the @xmath0 to baryon resonances .",
    "the decays of the n@xmath21 ( 1535 mev ) s11 and n@xmath21 ( 1710 mev ) p11 resonances into a free @xmath20n pair are not accessible either .",
    "it is then reasonable to assume that resonant @xmath20 production terms are small and can be neglected . with this in mind and following refs.@xcite the amplitudes for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 are , @xmath50 u(p)\\nonumber \\\\   & & i\\frac { 2 m f_{\\pi nn}}{m_{\\pi } } \\frac { 2 m f_{\\eta nn}}{m_{\\eta } }       f_{\\eta}(k ) f_{\\pi}(q ) { \\bar u } ( p ' ) \\left[k\\ ! \\ ! \\ ! / \\left(\\frac { 1}{s - m^2 } -   \\frac { 1}{u - m^2}\\right ) - \\frac { 1}{m}\\right ] u(p ) + \\nonumber \\\\   & & i g_{\\delta nn } \\frac { f_{\\delta}(q - k ) } { ( q - k)^2 - m_{\\delta}^2 } v_{\\delta \\eta \\pi}(k , q ) { \\bar u}(p ' ) u(p)~ , \\label{vr : dep1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51 u(p ) + \\nonumber \\\\   & & i g_{\\delta nn } \\frac { f_{\\delta}(q - k ) } { ( q - k)^2 - m_{\\delta}^2 } v_{\\delta \\eta ' \\pi}(k , q ) { \\bar u}(p ' ) u(p)~ , \\label{vr : dep2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 represent the mass and width of the n@xmath21 ( 1535 mev ) s11 resonance ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 the mass of a nucleon and a boson @xmath5 ; @xmath56 a source form factor parametrized in the usual form@xcite , @xmath57 it is easy to trace in the expressions above the contribution from s , u and t channels .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "[ vr : dep1 ] describe resonant production via nucleon isobar excitations , while the last term in both of these expressions stands for contributions from a @xmath7 meson t pole .",
    "the other meson conversion amplitudes and numerical details of the calculations are given in refs.@xcite and shall not be repeated here .",
    "we may now use eqns .",
    "[ vr : dep1 ] and [ vr : dep2 ] to evaluate the cross sections for the quasielastic processes @xmath48 and @xmath49 . at threshold",
    "these expressions predict for the amplitude squared : @xmath58 and @xmath59 which are consistent with the experimental values@xcite @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "predictions for @xmath62 are drawn in figs .",
    "3 - 4 versus the energy available in the center of mass ( cm ) system .",
    "due to mutual cancellation , the contribution from both of the s and u nucleon pole terms ( drawn separately as dot - dashed curve ) is negligibly small for both processes .",
    "the t pole terms are also of the same size though playing a different role in the two cases . for the @xmath48 reaction",
    "the resonant production exceeds by far any of the other contributions .",
    "the t pole term is relatively weak , becoming noticeable only through interference with the strong resonant production term . in case of the @xmath49",
    "however , there is no strong resonance term and the t pole contribution determines the cross section almost solely .",
    "the various exchange contributions are shown in fig .",
    "5 versus the energy available in the cm system .",
    "the solid line is the transition amplitude obtained with the relative phases of all different exchange contributions set to be + 1 . clearly , strong cancellations amongst these lower the transition amplitude to below @xmath75 .",
    "most important are the @xmath27 and @xmath76 exchanges with ratios @xmath77 .",
    "the ratios quoted above differ considerably from the ones reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath3 production , where the reaction proceeds mainly via nucleon isobar excitations and the relative importance of various exchanges is determined by s+u nucleon isobar pole terms .",
    "also the kinematic @xmath78 factors in eqns .",
    "[ minsigma]-[minomega ] vary strongly with the mass of the meson produced , giving rise to quite different ratios for the s+u nucleon pole terms . at threshold",
    "the vertices @xmath79 and @xmath80 are small and practically do not affect the calculated cross sections .    our predictions for the total cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "6 , along with the data from refs.@xcite .",
    "the curves shown are corrected for final state interactions according to the procedure described in ref.@xcite . to be consistent with the obe picture of the nn interactions @xcite we have disregarded @xmath0 exchange contributions .",
    "such contributions scale like @xmath81 and practically do not influence the cross sections presented here for the @xmath10 reactions .",
    "in summary we have applied a covariant obe model to calculate cross sections for the @xmath82 and @xmath83 reactions . in marked difference with the @xmath3 , we could reproduce near threshold cross sections for @xmath84 and @xmath85 without a resonant production via an intermediate baryon resonance . as in previous studies@xcite the model",
    "is based on the obe picture of the nn force@xcite and accounts for relativistic effects , energy dependence and nonlocality of the hadronic interactions .",
    "the calculations reported here and in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath86 provide a consistent description for pseudoscalar meson production in nn collisions .",
    "all calculations are carried out with the same formalism and meson - nucleon couplings as obtained by machleidt@xcite from fitting nn scattering data . the model success",
    "to explain data for these processes depends on how well the half off mass shell amplitude for the conversion processes , @xmath25 are calculated .",
    "as there are no data available which link directly to the off mass shell behavior of these amplitudes , this feature of the model needs still further verifications .",
    "yet it is encouraging that such a simple model reproduce the production rate for as light as a pion and as heavy as the @xmath0 meson .",
