    "both models and observations indicated that gas accretion should occur along filaments co - planar to the galaxy disk , whereas outflows are expected to extend along the galaxy projected minor axis .",
    "evidence for the geometric preference of inflowing and outflowing gas has already been observed for cool gas traced by absorption @xcite .",
    "it was originally reported that the equivalent width is dependent on galaxy inclination @xcite with the absorption kinematics consistent with being coupled to the galaxy angular momentum suggesting co - planar geometry @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a bimodality in the azimuthal angle distribution of gas around galaxies , where cool ( @xmath710@xmath8  k ) dense cgm gas prefers to exist along the projected galaxy major and minor axes ( also see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) with the gas covering fraction being enhanced by as much as 20%30% along these axes .",
    "they found that blue star - forming galaxies drive the bimodality while red passive galaxies contain gas along their projected major axis .",
    "outflows likely contain more metal enriched gas and higher velocity width absorption profiles since higher equivalent width absorption tends to reside along the projected minor axes of galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that absorption profiles with the largest velocity dispersion are associated with blue , face - on galaxies probed along the projected minor axis while the cloud column densities are largest for edge - on galaxies and blue galaxies .",
    "@xcite have also shown that absorption detected along the projected minor axes is kinematically consistent with bi - conical outflows .",
    "these combined results are consistent with galaxy evolution scenarios where star - forming galaxies accrete new cool / warm co - planer gas within an half - opening angle of about 20@xmath5 , forming new stars and producing metal - enriched galactic scale outflows with half opening angles of 50@xmath5 , while red galaxies exist passively due to reduced gas reservoirs @xcite .",
    "the conclusions are drawn from observations conducted using absorption , however both outflowing and infalling gas are expected to be mulit - phased and should be explored using other gas - phase tracers such as , , etc .",
    "another standard tracer of the diffuse cgm gas is the o0.1emvi  @xmath9 doublet .",
    "we know that there is a significant fraction of contained in the cgm @xcite that is typically gravitationally bound within the host galaxy s gravitational potential @xcite . compared to , the doublet can be more difficult to interpret since it can be commonly detected as photo - ionized or collisionally ionized gas .",
    "this implies that can trace warm / hot coronal regions surrounding galaxies , which may dictate the formation and destruction of the cool / warm cgm @xcite or trace other multi - phase gas structures .",
    "although absorption has been extensively studied in and around galaxies @xcite , the geometrical distribution of absorption around galaxies , which can yield improved understanding of the origins of such gas , has not been thoroughly observationally studied .",
    "@xcite attempted to address the azimuthal dependence of using 14 galaxies and found a mostly spatially uniform distribution of absorbing gas out to 300  kpc .",
    "there was small hint of a bimodality but was based on only five galaxies that were probed within one viral radius .",

    "we are just beginning to understand how this diffuse gas is associated with its host galaxies and what role it plays in galaxy evolution .",
    "we and others have shown that the covering fraction and equivalent width are dependent on the distance away from the galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that the majority of absorbers are produced by star - forming galaxies while non - absorbers are mostly associated with quiescent galaxies .",
    "this suggests that either the quantity of absorbing gas and/or the geometric distribution of this gas is different between star - forming and quiescent galaxies .",

    "@xcite presented the first hint of a possible bimodality with only five galaxies detected within one viral radius with the remaining sample probing larger impact parameters .",

    "the non - absorbing galaxies occur at the highest frequencies at intermediate @xmath0 between 20 - 60@xmath5 .",

    "we constrain the half opening angle of inflowing gas to be around 20@xmath5 , which is a factor of two larger than found for @xcite , while the half opening angle of outflowing gas is at least 30@xmath5 , which is consistent with previous results determined using different tracers for gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the mean equivalent widths , with the standard error in the mean , along the major and minor axes are @xmath322   and @xmath323   , respectively .",
    "these results suggest that either the column density , metallicity , and/or kinetic spread of outflowing gas is higher along the minor axis .",
    "@xcite has shown that absorption profiles with the largest velocity dispersion are associated with blue , face - on galaxies probed along the projected minor axis while the column densities are largest for edge - on galaxies and blue galaxies .",
    "these results are consistent with bi - conical outflows along the minor axis for star - forming galaxies causing an increase in kinematic spread and column density .",
    "there should also be an increase in metallicity as well due to enriched supernovae - driven winds but this has yet to be confirmed observationally .",
    "the equivalent width distribution along the projected major axis still contains moderately high equivalent width systems .",
    "this may suggest that we are not observing purely pristine accretion onto galaxies and it is likely associated with the recycling of previously ejected gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we have shown that the dependence on galaxy inclination is much weaker than the galaxy position angle and this is consistent with previous results shown for absorption @xcite .",
    "we do show that there appears to be a broader @xmath0 distribution of non - absorbers for edge - on galaxies with @xmath320 , which translates to a lower covering fraction for @xmath320 .",
    "these results are consistent with the picture that gas inflows along the major axis and outflows along the minor axis of galaxies . both the cross - section of the co - planer flows and the cross - section of conical outflows will be minimized for edge - on galaxies , thus leading to a higher frequency of non - absorbers .",
    "consistent with @xcite , we find bluer galaxies are preferentially selected to be absorbers while redder galaxies tend to be non - absorbers .",
    "this suggests that star - formation is a key driver in the distribution and covering fraction of around galaxies . however our results shown in figure  [ fig : oricolor ] also suggest that blue galaxies have detected preferentially along their minor axes while red galaxies have absorption preferentially detected along their major axes . this result could arise from our selected color bifurcation between blue and red galaxies at 1.5 in @xmath329 and @xmath328 , where the `` red '' galaxies could also contain red star - forming galaxies",
    "however , even if we changed our color cut to 2 ( selecting almost only quiescent galaxies ) , then out of seven red galaxies six still have @xmath331@xmath5 .",
    "thus , the cross - section of red galaxies could be dominated by small opening angle accretion of recycled material , while blue galaxies have a cross - section dominated by large - opening angle outflows .",
    "it is possible then , that the feedback mechanisms of the cgm also drive the predictions of gas cross - section and not just the presence of star - formation alone .",
    "we have constructed a sample of 29 absorbing ( ew>0.1   ) and 24 non - absorbing ( ew<0.1   ) galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts ranging between 0.08@xmath1@xmath2@xmath10.67 within @xmath3  kpc of bright background quasars .",
    "these galaxies are selected to be isolated such that there are no neighbors within 100  kpc and have velocity separations less than 500  .",
    "all these galaxy - absorber pairs were identified as part of our `` multiphase galaxy halos '' survey and from the literature .",
    "the background quasars all have medium resolution _ hst_/cos and stis ultraviolet spectra covering the o0.1emvi  @xmath9 doublet .",
    "the quasar fields have high resolution _ hst _ wfpc-2 , acs , and wfc3 imaging .",
    "we used gim2d to model the galaxy morphological properties and the azimuthal angle relative to the galaxy project major ( @xmath307@xmath5 ) and projected minor ( @xmath308@xmath5 ) axes and the quasar sight - line .",
    "we have analyzed the dependence of absorption on @xmath32 , azimuthal angle , and @xmath329 and @xmath328 color .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have shown that , for ew@xmath304   , the ovi rest - frame equivalent width is anti - correlated with impact parameter , @xmath32 ( 2.7@xmath22 ) .",
    "non - absorbers ( ew@xmath305   ) are found at all impact parameters , such that the covering fraction is 80% within 50  kpc and decreases monotonically to 33% at 200  kpc .",
    "the presence of absorption ( ew>0.1   ) is azimuthally dependent and primarily occurs along the projected major axis within a half opening angle of 20@xmath5 and along the project minor axis within a half opening angle of at least 30@xmath5 .",
    "these results are consistent with what is expected for major axis - fed inflows and minor axis - driven outflows as traced by and consistent with previous results found for absorption .",
    "3 .   the frequency of non - detected absorption ( ew<0.1   ) as a function of azimuthal angle is greatest in the range 3060@xmath5 .",
    "thus , there is a paucity of detectable ovi absorbing gas at intermediate azimuthal angles .",
    "this suggests that absorbing gas is not mixed throughout the cgm , but remains confined primarily within the outflowing winds and near to the planar disk region .",
    "non - absorbers also exist within @xmath410@xmath5 of the projected major axis .",
    "we show that the covering fraction of is 35% within 0 - 10@xmath5 , then peaks at 85% within 10 - 20@xmath5 , drops back to 35% again between 20 - 60@xmath5 and peaks up at 80% from 60 - 90@xmath5 . the lack of absorption within 10@xmath5 , increased presence of ovi absorption at 2030@xmath5 , and then sudden decrease beyond 30@xmath5 may suggest that cool gas resides in a narrow planar geometry surrounded by warm / hot gas .",
    "this could indicate accreting gas in which the cool material is narrowly confined to the disk plane and is surrounded by an also accreting warm / hot envelope , or indicate an extended disk with a pressure supported corona , or some combination of both scenarios .",
    "the covering fraction within 60 - 90@xmath5 suggests that outflows have very high covering fractions .",
    "the dependence of absorption on galaxy inclination is much weaker than the galaxy position angle and this is consistent with previous results shown for absorption .",
    "the covering fraction is constant at 60% at all @xmath317 except it drops by a factor of two at @xmath320 .",
    "this is interpreted as geometric minimization in the cross - section of co - planer flows and conical outflows occurring for edge - on systems .",
    "we determine that the equivalent width distributions for projected major axis gas for @xmath332@xmath5 and projected minor axis gas for @xmath333@xmath5 have mean equivalent widths , with the standard error in the mean , of @xmath322   and @xmath323   , respectively .",
    "therefore , higher equivalent width systems , including the highest ew systems , are found along the projected minor axis , which is consistent with an outflow scenario .",
    "consistent with previous results , we show that absorbers tend to have bluer colors while non - absorbers tend to have redder colors on average .",
    "this suggests that star - formation is a key driver in the detection rate of absorption .",
    "we show the relative dependence of blue ( 15 galaxies ) and red ( 12 galaxies ) absorbing galaxies on the distribution of @xmath0 for a color cut of 1.5 in @xmath329 and @xmath328 .",
    "blue galaxies show a low detection rate along the projected major axis with a gradual increase to its peak along the minor axis .",
    "the red galaxies show the strongest detection rate of absorption along the projected major axis with little - to - no detections along the minor axis .",
    "these results suggest that in the halos of blue galaxies are dominated by outflowing gas with wide opening angles while red galaxies appear to have gas along the projected major axis , which have smaller opening angles .",
    "this difference in orientation and opening angle between blue and red galaxies may explain why red galaxies less frequently produce absorption due to their low gas sky cross - section while blue galaxies have a much higher gas cross - section .",
    "our results are consistent with current models of gaseous multi - phase outflows and accretion / recycling .",
    "it is clear that high opening angle outflows are ubiquitous at all redshifts for star - forming galaxies , however , it is unclear whether we are still observing small opening angle cold accretion filaments at redshifts @xmath334 or , the more likely scenario , we are detecting recycling of previously ejected gas , which can be seen for most red and a few blue galaxies . placing constraints of the metallicity of these absorption systems",

    "<S> our results are consistent with cgm originating from major axis - fed inflows / recycled gas and from minor axis - driven outflows . </S>",
    "<S> non - detected  occurs between @xmath0=2060@xmath5 , suggesting that  is not mixed throughout the cgm and remains confined within the outflows and the disk - plane . </S>",
    "<S> we find low covering fractions within @xmath6@xmath5 of the projected major axis , suggesting that cool dense gas resides in a narrow planer geometry surrounded by diffuse  gas . </S>"
