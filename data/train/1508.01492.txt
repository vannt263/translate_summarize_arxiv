    "numerous precision tests of the standard model ( sm ) have taken placed in the last few decades .",
    "the results confirmed the sm as the best description of nature we have .",
    "moreover , those tests have also provided stringent constraints on many new physics effects .",
    "a clear example is given by the measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the muon , parametrized in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where recent experiments reached an impressive precision .",
    "the @xmath4 has a relative enhancement of @xmath5 compared to the electron anomalous magnetic moment , therefore , @xmath4 is much better suited to unveil or limit new physics effects , on the other hand , the @xmath4 allows to test the entire sm since each sector yields a sizeable correction @xcite .",
    "the tau magnetic moment would provide an even better sensitive , but its relatively short lifetime makes a direct measurement impossible , at least at present .",
    "thus , we will focus our study on the muon magnetic moment hereafter .",
    "the present difference @xmath6 yields a @xmath7 discrepancy @xcite .",
    "the large theoretical uncertainties stemming from the the hadronic vacuum polarization and the hadronic contribution to the light - by - light scattering can overshadow the significance of this discrepancy . in the near future important improvements in both",
    "the theoretical and experimental situations are expected . combining the expected progress from the theoretical side , along with the projected experimental sensitivity for the g-2 experiment at fermilab , the precision will likely reach @xmath8 , possibly increasing the magnitude of the signal up to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "hence , it is worthwhile to investigate which particle physics models are capable of addressing the muon magnetic moment and also use the current and projected sensitive to derive robust bounds .",
    "+ in this work , we will focus our effort on an electroweak extension of the standard model known as 3 - 4 - 1 model .",
    "this model extends @xmath10 sm gauge group to a @xmath11 one .",
    "the motivations for considering such class of models rely on the following : + ( i ) they explain the number of generations by a combination of qcd asymptotic freedom and anomaly cancellation @xcite ; + ( ii ) they might have plausible dark matter candidates inherited for embedding the 3 - 3 - 1 models in the context of the higgs portal @xcite , @xmath12 portal @xcite , and dark radiation @xcite capable of addressing interesting indirect detection signals @xcite + ( iii ) they are generally consistent with current collider data @xcite ; + the muon magnetic moment has been addressed in the context of 3 - 4 - 1 models , but in different versions @xcite . in those previous studies",
    "exotic charged leptons were absent .",
    "the presence of exotic charged leptons induce profound changes in the computations and conclusions derived from the muon magnetic moment .",
    "hence , we will restrain our study to a 3 - 4 - 1 model which contains heavy charged leptons .",
    "flavor changing neutral current processes and the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanisms have been fully investigated in such model . however , there is a lack of phenomenological studies , specially related to the muon magnetic moment in 3 - 4 - 1 model ( see refs.@xcite for studies in 3 - 3 - 1 models ) .",
    "our goal is to compute all corrections to the muon magnetic moment using the public g-2 code @xcite and determine whether or not this model is a plausible framework to accommodate the muon magnetic moment excess .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : in the section ii we describe the model , whereas in section iii we discuss existing bounds .",
    "we review the muon magnetic moment and present our main results in section iv .",
    "lastly in section v we draw our conclusions .",
    "there are several 3 - 4 - 1 models that lead to different fermion and gauge boson content @xcite .",
    "those models are based on the most general expression for the electric charge operator for the @xmath13 found to be , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are free parameters that set the fermion and scalar multiplets as well as the the gauge boson content .",
    "@xmath17 , with @xmath18 the gell - mann matrices for @xmath11 normalized as tr@xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the diagonal @xmath21 unit matrix . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath22 setting , whose the covariant derivative is found to be @xmath23 , where    @xmath24    the lepton representation in this model is :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 are family indexes . in order to cancel all the quirial anomalies , two left handed quark families must transform as 4-plets and the other one as an anti 4-plet    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath26 are family indexes . from eqs.([covderiv])-([eq.20 ] ) we see the 3 - 4 - 1 particle spectrum is rather rich .",
    "as far as the muon magnetic moment is concerned few particles will be relevant as we shall see further .",
    "we now briefly discuss the scalar sector .      to generate masses for the fermions and gauge bosons of the mode",
    "the following multiplets are needed , @xmath30 , \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\langle\\phi^t_2\\rangle&=&\\langle(\\phi^-_2,\\phi^0_2,\\phi^{\\prime 0}_2,\\phi^{\\prime\\prime 0}_2)\\rangle=(0,v',0,0)\\sim[1,4^*,-1/4 ] , \\\\",

    "using the configuration of the vev described in eq.([scalars ] ) we find the masses of the gauge bosons to be , @xmath36    for the neutral gauge bosons the @xmath37 mass matrix has a zero eigenvalue corresponding to the photon .",
    "for the remainder @xmath38 matrix we obtain the mass eigenvectors @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the approximation",
    "@xmath42 the field @xmath43 decouples from the other two and acquires a mass @xmath44 .",
    "the latter is not relevant to the muon magnetic moment so it will be hereafter ignored .",
    "the other two massive gauge bosons are mixed and have a mass matrix in the basis @xmath45 given by , @xmath46\\end{array}\\right),\\]]where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the sine and cosine of the electroweak mixing angle .    by diagonalizing this mass matrix",
    "we get the two physical neutral gauge bosons @xmath50 where the mixing angle is given by @xmath51-v^2 s^2_w}.\\ ] ]    we will take the limit which the mixing angle is small enough so that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "now we have shown mass terms of the gauge bosons we present below the charged and neutral currents relevant for the muon magnetic moment ,    @xmath54    @xmath55    where    @xmath56    we point out that eq.[cc ] and eq.[nc ] which refer to the charged and neutral current contain only the relevant interactions for the muon magnetic moment .",
    "obviously the complete charged and neutral currents are comprised of many other interactions involving all fermions and gauge bosons of the model .",
    "we decided not to dwell on unnecessary details and for this reason we present only the terms in eq.([cc ] ) and eq.([nc ] ) .",
    "searches for resonances on the @xmath57 reaction with cms data resulted on the exclusion of @xmath58 below of @xmath59 2.5tev @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath12 gauge boson in this study does not couple to the fermions like ours , so it is unclear what would be the limit in our model . if we are conservative and take this limit on the @xmath12 mass to lie in the tev scale , it can be translated into a lower limit of @xmath60tev on the scale of symmetry breaking of the model . moreover , using precise measurements on sm z boson a lower bound of @xmath2tev has been placed on the @xmath12 mass @xcite precisely in this model .",
    "the latter implies into a scale of symmetry breaking greater than 5.7 tev .",
    "furthermore flavor changing neutral current studies rule out @xmath12 masses below 11 tev , depending on the parametrization scheme used in the quark sector @xcite .",
    "in summary , there are several bounds possibly applicable to this model , but the limit of @xmath61  tev on the scale of symmetry breaking of the model is definitely the most robust and will be our reference from now on .",
    "after discussion the existing bounds , we review the muon magnetic moment and show our results .",
    "the dirac equation predicts a muon magnetic moment    @xmath62    with gyromagnetic ratio @xmath63 .",
    "however , quantum loop effects lead to a small calculable deviation from @xmath63 , the anomalous magnetic moment , parametrized by @xmath64 .",
    "the sm prediction for the @xmath4 is generally divided into three parts : electromagnetic ( qed ) , electroweak ( ew ) and hadronic contributions @xcite .",
    "the qed part , which is by far the dominant contribution in the sm , includes all photonic and leptonic ( @xmath65 ) contributions and has been computed up to four loops and estimated at the 5 loops@xcite .",
    "the ew contribution comprises @xmath66 and higgs bosons , and has been calculated up to three loops .",
    "the hadronic contributions are the most uncertain though and can not be calculated by first principles .",
    "the hadronic vacuum polarization is determined from @xmath67 hadrons or @xmath68 hadrons data @xcite .",
    "the next largest uncertainty is associated with hadronic light - by - light scattering , which is computed using hadronic models that correctly reproduce the properties of qcd @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath4 is @xcite ,    @xmath69    the e821 experiment at brookhaven national lab has reported @xcite ,    @xmath70    thus ,    @xmath71    which points to a @xmath7 discrepancy .",
    "the current theoretical error of @xmath72 is driven by the @xmath73 uncertainty on lowest - order hadronic contribution and the @xmath74 uncertainty on the hadronic light - by - light contribution as aforesaid@xcite .",
    "a long standing effort predicts that the uncertainty on the lowest - order hadronic contribution could be dwindled to @xmath75 with existing data and further work on the hadronic light - by - light contributions could reduce the total sm error to possibly @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the fermilab experiment will play an important role in this setup with the proposed experimental error of @xmath77 .",
    "the combined effort in theory and experiment front is expect to reach    @xmath78    this discrepancy in eq.([deltaa ] ) will be referred as future sensitivity for the muon magnetic moment .",
    "that being said we computed all corrections to the muon magnetic moment stemming from our model using the public code in ref.@xcite . in this model",
    "those contributions arise from the presence of exotic charged leptons and the neutral vector boson @xmath79 ( see fig [ feyn2 ] ) . in this work",
    "we ignore the contributions stemming from charged and neutral scalars since they are suppressed by the muon mass .",

    "moreover , for @xmath88  tev , using current and projected @xmath0 bounds we then rule out scales smaller than @xmath85  tev and @xmath90  tev respectively . thus our study of the muon magnetic moment provides robust and complementarity bounds on the mass spectrum and scale of symmetry breaking of the model .",
    "we emphasize that our field content is quite different from 3 - 3 - 1 @xcite and 3 - 4 - 1 models @xcite proposed in the literature , therefore a new look into the muon magnetic moment contributions stemming from this 3 - 4 - 1 model was necessary .",
    "the muon magnetic moment has been addressed in the context of 3 - 4 - 1 models , but in different versions . in this work we investigate g-2 in a 3 - 4 - 1 comprised of exotic charged leptons .",
    "the presence of exotic charged leptons induce negative and sizable corrections to the muon magnetic moment . since the overall contribution to g-2 is negative , we place stronger bounds on the mass and scale of symmetry breaking of the model by enforcing the total correction to lie within the current and projected error bars .",
