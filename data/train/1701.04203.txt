    "in this article , we are interested in * characterizing isochronous center * of * polynomial real vector fields * which can be written using complex coordinates as ( see @xcite ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 such that @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a polynomial of a maximal degree @xmath6 given by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and the coefficients @xmath9 satisfy @xmath10 .    a vector field is said to be isochronous if all its orbits in a neighbourhood of an equilibrium point are periodic with the same period .",

    ", we use two classes of objects to study linearisation : * prenormal forms * and the * correction * introduced by j. ecalle and b. vallet in @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of these objects is that they are * computable algorithmically * and thus provide * explicit criterion of linearisability * and moreover that they possess a * rich algebraic structure * coming from the use of the * mould formalism*. the linearisability is equivalent to the fact that any prenormal form of a given vector field is reduced to the linear part or its correction is trivial ( see @xcite ) . + more precisely , let us consider a vector field in a _ prepared form _ : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , the @xmath15 are homogeneous differential operators of degree @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and all most one of the @xmath19 is equal to @xmath20 i.e @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the set of degree associated to @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "+ considering a polynomial vector field of the form ( [ form ] ) , the previous decomposition leads to three types of differential operators : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 . +",
    "a * prenormal * form associated to @xmath11 is an expression of the form : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a word obtained by concatenation of letters in @xmath26 , @xmath32 is the set of words constructed on @xmath26 , and for @xmath33 , @xmath34 denotes the usual composition of differential operators and @xmath35 . following j. ecalle @xcite ,",
    "we denote by @xmath36 and we call * mould * the map from @xmath37 to @xmath38 defined @xmath39 = m^{\\mathbf{n}}$ ] .",
    "the corresponding map for the differential operators @xmath40 is called a * comould*.    let @xmath41 be the morphism defined for any letter @xmath42 by @xmath43 , with @xmath44",
    ". then we have for any word @xmath45 that @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , the quantity @xmath48",
    "is called the weight of the word @xmath49 .",
    "a word @xmath50 is said to be resonant if @xmath51 .",
    "a fundamental role is played by resonant words as they are in one to one correspondence with monomials in the vector field @xmath11 which forming an obstruction to linearisability .",
    "precisely , we have :    the mould @xmath36 of a prenormal form satisfies @xmath52 for non - resonant word @xmath31 .    in the same way",
    ", the _ correction _ of @xmath11 is given by @xmath53 where the mould @xmath54 is defined algorithmically ( see @xcite ) and satisfies @xmath55 and @xmath56 for all non - resonant word @xmath57 .",
    "+ using these two objects , the linearisation is equivalent to the fact that : @xmath58 where the mould @xmath36 is either the mould @xmath54 of the correction or a mould @xmath59 of a given prenormal form .",
    "_ isochronicity _ is then equivalent to find the conditions on the coefficients of a polynomial @xmath60 such that such a formal series vanishes .",
    "+ the interest of the mould formalism with respect to others approaches is that it separates the part depending on the coefficients of @xmath60 ( the comould contribution ) from the universal one depending only on the alphabet @xmath26 generated by the vector field ( the mould part ) .",
    "moreover , as already pointed out by j. ecalle and d. schlomiuk ( see @xcite,@xmath61.10,p.1474 ) , the main difficulty in order to solve the isochronicity problem is that the `` ideal @xmath62 generated by ( finitely many ) taylor coefficients of @xmath11 is unwieldy , unstructured and lacking in truly canonical bases . ''",
    "they propose to replace the commutative ideal @xmath62 by some lie ideals which arise naturally in the mould formalism approach ( see @xcite,@xmath61.10,p.1475 - 1475 for more details ) .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to * interpret some classical isochronous center conditions in term of lie ideals * following the general * program proposed by j. ecalle and d. schlomiuk*. we are leaded to define a notion of * geometric complexity * for an * isochronous center condition*. + the plan of the paper is as follows : by studying first the isochronous center conditions for quadratic polynomials , we observe that the * uniform * and * holomorph isochronous centers * are related to the * nilpotence * and * triviality * of the lie algebra generated by the family of differential operators @xmath15 , @xmath42 and the * resonant * set respectively .",
    "these conditions do not depend on the value of the underlying mould and in some way are the * simplest * one .",
    "we then generalize these results for polynomial vector fields with an arbitrary large degree improving on an unpublished paper of b. schuman @xcite .",
