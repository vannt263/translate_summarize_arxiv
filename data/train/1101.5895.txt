    "consider a one - dimensional lattice model amenable to treatment by the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg),@xcite with hamiltonian @xmath3 , ground state @xmath4 and ground state energy @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is concerned with zero - temperature spectral functions of the form @xmath6 which represents the fourier transform @xmath7 of the correlator",
    "@xmath8 one possible framework for calculating such spectral functions is to expand them in terms of chebychev polynomials , as advocated in ref .  .",
    "such a chebyshevexpansion offers precise and convenient control of the accuracy and resolution with which a spectral function is to be computed .",
    "this is very useful , particularly when broadening the spectral function of a length-@xmath9 system , which exhibits finite - size subpeaks with spacing @xmath10 , in order to mimick that of an infinite system : if the latter has structures ( e.g.  sharp or diverging peaks ) which are not yet properly resolved at the scale @xmath11 , the broadened version of the finite - size spectral function inevitably bears @xmath9-dependent errors in the vicinity of these structures .",
    "hence , when calculating the finite - size version of these structures for the length-@xmath9 system , there is no need to achieve an accuracy beyond that of the expected @xmath9-dependent errors , and having convenient control of this accuracy can significantly reduce numerical costs .    in this paper , we show that chebyshev expansions offer numerically efficient representations for calculating spectral functions using matrix product state ( mps ) methods,@xcite with numerical costs that compare favorably to those of other established dmrg - based approaches . in particular , the chebychev mps approach presented here , to be called chemps , allows the abovementioned control of accuracy and resolution to be imported into the dmrg / mps arena .",
    "the historically first approach for calculating spectral functions with dmrg is the continued - fraction expansion.@xcite while this method requires only modest numerical resources , it is limited to low frequencies and it is difficult to produce reliable results with it in the case of continua ( however , algorithmic improvements were reported recently ) . at present ,",
    "the most accurate , but also most time - consuming approaches are : ( i ) the correction vector ( cv ) method,@xcite and ( ii ) time - dependent dmrg ( tdmrg),@xcite in particular when combined with linear prediction techniques.@xcite since any new approach must measure up to their standards , let us briefly summarize their key ideas , advantages and drawbacks .",
    "\\(i ) to calculate @xmath12 using the cv approach , it is expressed as    [ eq : cv ] @xmath13 in terms of the so - called correction vector @xmath14 { \\hat{\\mathcal{c}}}|0\\rangle \\ ; .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the correction vector can be calculated ( for finite broadening parameter @xmath15 ) using either conventional dmrg @xcite or variational matrix product state ( mps ) methods.@xcite a major advantage of this approach is that arbitrarily high spectral resolution can be achieved by reducing @xmath15 and sampling enough frequency points .",
    "however , this comes at considerable numerical costs : first , a separate calculation is required for every choice of @xmath16 ( though in doing so , results for @xmath17 s from previous frequencies can be incorporated ) ; and second , the calculation of @xmath18 involves an operator inversion problem that is numerically poorly conditioned , ever more so the smaller @xmath15 is .",
    "\\(ii ) an alterative possibility is to use tdmrg to calculate the time - domain correlator @xmath19 , fourier transforming to the frequency domain only at the very end . to this end",
    ", one expresses    [ eq : tdmrg ] @xmath20 in terms of the time - evolved state @xmath21    and uses tdmrg to calculate the latter .",
    "two attractive features of this strategy are : first , it builds on an extensive body of algorithmic knowledge for efficiently calculating time - evolution;@xcite and second , a simple linear - prediction scheme @xcite can be used to extrapolate the time - dependence calculated for short and intermediate time scales to longer times , thereby improving the quality of results at low frequency at hardly any additional numerical cost . however , obtaining reliable results over a sufficiently large time interval can , in itself , be numerically very expensive , since the time - evolution of the many - body state @xmath22 is accompanied by a strong growth in entanglement entropy .",
    "this unavoidably also implies a growth of tdmrg truncation errors .    note that in both of the schemes outlined above , significant ( often heroic ) amounts of numerical resources are devoted to calculating a single state , @xmath17 for given @xmath16 or @xmath22 for given @xmath23 , as accurately as possible ;",
    "the overlaps or expectation values of interest , namely @xmath24 for @xmath25 , are only calculated _ at the end _",
    ", in a single , final step , after @xmath17 or @xmath22 have been fully determined .",
    "actually , these states are calculated so accurately that they would have been equally suitable for calculating any other quantity ( correlator or matrix element ) involving that state . in a sense",
    ", dmrg is asked to work harder than necessary : it is used to calculate a single state with `` general - purpose accuracy '' , whereas the accurate calculation of a particular expectation value involving that state would have been sufficient .",
    "the main motivation for the present work is to attempt to reduce this calculational overhead by employing a representation of the spectral function that avoids the need for calculating a single state with such high accuracy and instead allows numerical resources to be focussed directly on the calculation of the relevant expectation values .",
    "this can be achieved by representing the spectral function via a _",
    "chebychev expansion_,@xcite whose coefficients , the so - called chebyshevmoments , can be calculated recursively using mps tools .",
    "below , we briefly summarize the structure and main features of such an expansion , thereby providing both an introduction and an overview of the material developed in detail in the main part of this paper .    the chebychev polynomials @xmath26 form an orthonormal set of polynomials on the interval @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "they are very well studied mathematically,@xcite and are widely used for function expansions since they have very favorable convergence properties .",

    "( ii ) the range of frequencies over which the spectral function has nonzero weight , say @xmath39 ( to be called its _ spectral width _ ) is often significantly smaller than the many - body bandwidth of the hamiltonian , say @xmath40 , as depicted in fig  [ fig : rescaling - sketch ] .",
    "is much smaller than the many - body bandwidth @xmath40 . before making a chebychev expansion ,",
    "we rescale the interval @xmath41 $ ] , with effective bandwidth @xmath42 , onto the interval @xmath43 $ ] , shown in ( b ) , with rescaled half - bandwidth @xmath44 and a safety factor @xmath45 . ]    by choosing the effective bandwidth @xmath46 to be of order @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 , huge gains in resolution are possible .",
    "+ ( iii ) a well - controlled broadening scheme , encoded in the damping factors @xmath32 , is available that allows finite - size effects to be either resolved or smeared out , as desired .",
    "+ ( iv ) the chebyshevvectors @xmath47 are calculated using a ( numerically stable ) _ recursion _ scheme , which exploits chebychev recurrence relations to calculate @xmath48 from @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmrg - recipe-3 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the expectation values from which the spectral function is constructed are built up in a series of recursive steps ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum - mu ] ) below ) instead of being calculated at the end in one final step . +",
    "( v ) the bond entropy of successive chebyshevvectors @xmath0 is found empirically to _",
    "remain bounded _ with increasing recursion number @xmath1 , thus the complexity of these vectors remains managable up to arbitrarily large @xmath1 .",
    "+ ( vi ) finally , and from the perspective of numerical costs , most importantly : chemps__efficiently copes _ _ with the _ growth in bond entropy _ with increasing iteration number that usually limits dmrg approaches .",
    "it does so by distributing this entropy over all @xmath0 , thereby packaging it into managable units ( see ( v ) ) .",
    "in particular , when constructing and using the states @xmath51 , one never needs to know more than three at a time ( and after use may delete them from memory ) .",
    "hence , it is not necessary to combine all information contained in all @xmath0 into a single mps .",
    "let us constrast this with the cv or tdmrg approaches : imagine expanding the correction vector or time - evolved state in terms of the chebyshevvectors @xmath0 , i.e.  expressing them as linear combinations of the form @xmath52 respectively .",
    "( the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 are related by fourier transformation . )",
    "now , the cv or tdmrg approaches in effect attempt to accurately represent the _ entire linear combination _ using a single mps .",
    "this endevour is numerically very costly , since the entanglement entropy of this linear combination grows rapidly with @xmath55 .",
    "the chebychev approach avoids this problem by taking expectation values _ before _ performing the sum on @xmath1 : @xmath56 thus , the chebychev expansion very conveniently organizes the calculation into many separate , and hence numerically less costly , packages or subunits .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the chebyshevexpansion for spectral functions in and discuss its implementation using mps including a new algorithm for performing a projection in energy in . in we present chempsresults for the structure factor of a spin-@xmath2 heisenberg chains , perform a detailed analysis of finite - size effects ( see ) , and compare our results to cv , bethe ansatz and tdmrg ( see figs .

    "we follow the notation of ref .  , which gives an excellent general discussion of chebyshevexpansion techniques ( though without mentioning possible dmrg / mps applications ) .",
    "chebyshev polynomialsof the first kind , @xmath58 , henceforth simply called chebyshev polynomials , are defined by the recurrence relations @xmath59 they also satisfy the useful relation ( for @xmath60 ) @xmath61 two useful explicit representations are : @xmath62 =      \\cosh\\left[n \\ , \\textrm{arccosh}(x)\\right ] .\\ ] ] on the interval @xmath63 $ ] the chebyshev polynomialsconstitute an orthogonal system of polynomials ( over a weight function @xmath64 ) , in terms of which any piecewise smooth and continuous function @xmath65 can be expanded .",

    "there are several ways of constructing chebyshevapproximations for @xmath79 ( see weisse et  al.,@xcite , section ii.a ) .",

    "@xmath81 are given by @xmath82 an approximate representation of order @xmath55 is obtained for @xmath83 if only the first @xmath55 terms ( i.e.  @xmath84 ) are retained .",
    "however , such a truncation in general introduces artificial oscillations , of period @xmath85 , called _",
    "gibbs oscillations_. these can be smoothened by employing certain broadening kernels , which in effect rearrange the infinite series ( [ eq : cheby - expansion - infinite ] ) before truncation .",

    "@xmath32 , real numbers whose form is characteristic of the chosen kernel .",
    "several choices have been proposed , which damp out gibbs oscillations in somewhat different ways ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "we will mostly employ _ jackson damping _ , given by @xmath88 this is usually the best choice , since it guarantees an integrated error of @xmath89 for @xmath90 . when used to approximate a @xmath91-function @xmath92 sitting at @xmath93 , jackson damping yields a nearly gaussian peak of width @xmath94 .",

    "continuing our list of observations from the previous subsection , we note the following features : ( vii ) both @xmath393 and @xmath394 are smaller than 1% already for @xmath248 ( ( a ) ) , in accord with similar error margins for @xmath366 in ( c ) .",
    "( viii ) both @xmath393 and @xmath395 decrease with increasing @xmath171 , but @xmath395 does so more slowly , and its decrease seems to saturate beyond @xmath249 .",
    "this implies that _ energy truncation is the main limiting factor _ for chemps .",
    "the reason is that the intended purpose of energy truncation , namely to strip @xmath0 from its high - energy components , modifies it in a way whose errors can not be reduced to arbitrarily small values .",
    "indeed , this is illustrated by the following two points : ( ix ) while both @xmath396 and @xmath397 initially decrease with increasing krylov subspace dimension @xmath194 , the decrease saturates for @xmath398 ( ( b , c ) ) ; ( x ) while @xmath399 initially decreases with the number of sweeps @xmath222 , the decrease saturates already for @xmath400 ( c ) .",

    "the speed of the initial stages of the rise differs from panel to panel . for the density matrix spectra calculated _ without _ energy truncation ( ( a , c ) ) ,",
    "the initial rise is rather slow , in particular for the rlm ( ( a ) , where the rise is preceded by a slight initial decrease ) , reflecting the lack of strong correlations of this model .",
    "in contrast , for density matrix spectra calculated _ with _ energy truncation ( ( b , d ) ) , the initial rise is very rapid , and its subsequent saturation sets in at quite small @xmath1 ( of order 20 to 30 ) .",
    "thus , energy truncation evidently has the effect of increasing entanglement entropy .",
    "the reason is that the latter is calculated in a different basis ( the eigenbasis of @xmath423 ) than that used to perform energy truncation ( the local eigenbasis of @xmath33 ) .    according to ( d ) , the small mps dimension of @xmath248 used for the hafm in ( a ) in effect amounts to discarding the contributions to the reduced density matrix of all states with weight below a threshold of around @xmath347 .",
    "this threshold is rather large compared to typical dmrg calculations , where characteristic truncation errors lie in the range @xmath175 to @xmath176 .",
    "it is remarkable that chempsis nevertheless able to give rather accurate results ( such as reproducing cv results obtained using @xmath424 ) .",
    "this efficiency appears to be an intrinsic feature of chemps , arising from the recursive manner in which the chebyshevvectors @xmath422 are constructed .",

    "remarkably , the bond entropy shows no tendencies towards unbounded growth , even up to values as large as @xmath426 .",
    "quite to the contrary : although the bond entropy increases somewhat when increasing @xmath171 from 32 to 128 ( with @xmath427 ) , for either case it tends to _ decrease _ with recursion number @xmath1 , and similarly for the choice @xmath144 without energy truncation .",
    "all of this is very encouraging , since it indicates that @xmath1 can be increased , apparently at will , _ without incurring any runaway growth of dmrg truncation errors_. the reasons for this fact will be recapitulated in the summary below .    for comparison ,",
    "( b ) shows the bond entropy @xmath428 of a tdmrg calculation of the time evolution of @xmath429 .",
    "this entropy is , overall , smaller than the @xmath404 of the chebyshevvectors , because the initial state for the time evolution involves an excitation at only one site , whereas the starting state for the chempsrecursion involved a linear combination of local excitations , @xmath430 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - k ] ) ) . the most striking difference between @xmath404 and @xmath428 , however , is that the former shows no trend to increase with @xmath1 , whereas the latter does with @xmath23 .",
    "the increase in @xmath428 occurs in spurts , that happen each time a spin wave gets reflected from one of the ends of the system , at which point more numerical resources are required to keep track of the superposition of incident and reflected spin waves . for the present problem ,",
    "the increase in @xmath405 was not severe and remained completely under control ( staying below @xmath431 throughout ) .",
    "nevertheless , we do believe that the contrast between ( a ) and ( b ) , showing a nonincreasing trend for @xmath431 vs. an increasing trend for @xmath432 , is striking and significant .",
    "it suggests that for situations that feature strong entanglement growth with time , tchempsmight be a promising alternative to tdmrg .",
    "in this work , we have described chempsas a method for calculating zero - temperature spectral functions of one - dimensional quantum lattice models using a combination of a chebyshevexpansion and mps technology . to summarize our analysis",
    ", we would like to highlight what we believe to be the two most important features of chemps , namely its efficiency and its control of spectral resolution .",
    "_ efficiency .",
    "_ the first main feature is that chempsprovides an _ attractive compromise between accuracy and efficiency_. it is capable of reproducing correction vector results in the frequency domain and tdmrg results in the time domain with comparably modest numerical resources . in particular ,",
    "surpringly small values for the mps dimension of @xmath171 are sufficient , even for obtaining spectral resolution high enough to resolve finite size effects in great detail .",
    "( for example , @xmath248 sufficed for the spin-@xmath2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model . ) this remarkable efficiency , which we had not anticipated when commencing this study , appears to be a consequence of several factors : ( i ) chempsdoes not suffer from a runaway growth of dmrg truncation error with increasing @xmath1 , because the information needed to construct the spectral function with a specified accuracy , say @xmath104 , is not encoded in a single state , but uniformly distributed over @xmath55 distinct chebyshevvectors @xmath0 .",
    "( ii ) these can be determined from chebychev recurrence relations involving only three terms , so that it is never necessary to accurately represent the sum of more than two mps .",
    "( iii ) moreover , these recurrence relations are numerically stable , i.e.  the inaccuracies in the calculation of chebyshevvectors @xmath0 do not cause the chebyshevexpansion to diverge .",
    "( iv ) finally , the accuracy needed for each @xmath0 is set by that needed for @xmath433 ( ) , which does not need to be better than the specified accuracy , namely @xmath434 .    for spectral functions with a finite spectral width @xmath39 ( which is typically much smaller than the many - body bandwidth @xmath40 ) ,",
    "chempsoffers a further attractive feature for enhancing efficiency : one may use an `` effective bandwidth '' @xmath46 of order @xmath39 ( we typically take @xmath42 ) , which enhances spectral resolution by a factor @xmath435 , at the cost of requiring additional energy trunctation sweeps .",
    "the latter are not necessary if one takes @xmath144 , but then considerably higher expansion orders are necessary to achieve comparable resolution . in our experience",
    "the benefits of enhanced resolution offered by the choice @xmath436 outweigh the costs of energy truncation .",
    "_ control of spectral resolution . _ the second main feature of chempsis that it offers _ very convenient control of the accuracy and resolution _ of the resulting spectral function , by simply adjusting the expansion order @xmath55 .",
    "this is particularly useful for studying finite - size effects , as exemplified in . on the one hand ,",
    "( b ) shows very strikingly that the structure factor an hafm chain of finite length is dominated by a set of discrete subpeaks which may be associated with the quantized eigenenergies of spin wave excitations in a finite system .",
    "chempsallows the energies and weights of these excitations , and their dependence on @xmath9 , to be determined with unprecedented accuracy and ease , by simply increasing @xmath55 until the peaks are well resolved . on the other hand ,",
    "( f ) shows that the limit @xmath437 may be mimicked by choosing @xmath55 just small enough that the finite - size subpeaks are smeared out . though the peak shape thus obtained is slightly overbroadened ( see inset of ( f ) ) , this overbroadening can be eliminated completely ( see ) by using a discrete representation of the spectral function , that uses the energies and weights of the discrete subpeaks as input .",
    "the ability to fully eliminate overbroadening effects even for very large many - body systems is , to the best of our knowledge , a unique feature of chemps .    on a technical level , the implementation of chempsrequires only standard mps techniques , such as the addition of different states and the multiplication of operators . for energy truncation , single - site",
    "sweeping needs to be set up with a new kind of local update , as described in .",
    "however , this procedure is not too different from other known local update prescriptions and can be implemented with modest programming effort .",
    "regarding future applications of chemps , two directions for further methodological development appear particularly promising , namely time - dependence and finite temperature .",
    "a few comments are due about each .    _ time dependence .",
    "_ while the good agreement between tchempsand tdmrg reported in is encouraging , a detailed analysis of tchempsshould be performed to understand the nature of its error growth with time , and to explore under which conditions , if any , tchempsoffers competitive advantages relative to tdmrg . on the one hand , tdmrg has the advantage that highly efficient krylov methods can be used to optimize the evaluation of @xmath438 contains a broad spectrum of excited states . on the other hand , chempshas the advantage ( i ) that the chebychev expansion of the operator @xmath439 can be applied with equal accuracy to every state in the hilbert space , in particular also highly excited ones .",
    "moreover , ( ii ) very large evolution times might be achieved more easily with tchempsthan tdmrg , since the former represents @xmath440 as a sum over many chebyshevvectors ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin - comb ] ) ) , thereby being potentially less susceptible than tdmrg to the growth of truncation errors ( as discussed in the introduction , and exemplified in ) .",
    "we expect that for some applications ( i ) and/or ( ii ) may offer advantages for tchempsover tdmrg , e.g.  for calculating quantum quenches starting from strongly nonequilibrium initial states , but leave a detailed investigation to the future",

    ", we used the following criterion for choosing @xmath55 when reconstructing @xmath493 : the effective broadening @xmath287 was taken as large as possible without lowering the peak height significantly below that of @xmath494 ( this corresponds to choosing @xmath495 ) .",
    "the results of these calculations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmlm - all ] ; all spectra shown there were obtained by performing separate expansions for the positive and negative branches , @xmath496 ( with one exception , noted below ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : rmlm - all](a1-g1 ) were calculated using an effective bandwidth of @xmath497 ( with @xmath498 ) for each branch , corresponding to roughly twice the spectral width of each branch , which is of order of the single - particle band - width , @xmath499 . for this choice ,",
    "an mps dimension of merely @xmath248 was found to suffice for accurate recurrence fitting .",
    "figure  [ fig : rmlm - all](a1 ) illustrates a number of points : ( i ) by choosing @xmath287 according to the above criterion of recovering the correct peak height , excellent agreement with the continuum limit @xmath500 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rlm - a - cont ] ) is obtained over most of the frequency range .",
    "( ii ) this is the case both with and without jackson damping ( thin black or blue lines , respectively ) , but with jackson damping , higher expansion orders are needed to obtain the correct peak heights , since jackson damping induces some artificial broadening ( by a factor of @xmath501 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : kernels - j ] ) ) .",
    "( iii ) small oscillations remain in some frequency ranges ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : rmlm - all](b1-g1 ) for zooms ) .",
    "these stem from three sources : finite - size subpeaks , numerical inaccuracies and step function artefacts near @xmath502 ( cf .",
    "points ( iv ) , ( vi ) and ( viii ) below , respectively ) .",
    "( iv ) for the spectrum with the narrowest peak , @xmath492 , the window between @xmath11 and @xmath503 is so small that the criterion of reproducing the continuum peak height implies that small finite - size subpeak remain visible , see figs .",
    "[ fig : rmlm - all](e1-g1 ) for zooms .",
    "( v ) in contrast , such oscillations are almost entirely absent for the broadest peak , @xmath504 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : rmlm - all](d1,e1 ) ) , since its width @xmath505 is somewhat larger than @xmath11 .    in order to illustrate the effect of energy truncation , figs .",
    "[ fig : rmlm - all](a2-g2 ) show the same spectral functions as ( a1-g1 ) , but now setting @xmath506 , the full many - body bandwidth ( here = 52.3 ) , so that no energy truncation is needed .",
    "this allows us to make some additional instructive observations : ( vi ) using the full bandwidth yields results of higher quality , in that numerical artefacts are significantly weaker ( except near @xmath502 ) , compare figs .",
    "[ fig : rmlm - all](d2-g2 ) and ( d1-g1 ) .",
    "the reason is that energy truncation constitutes chemps s dominant source of error ( as shown in section  [ sec : error - analysis ] below ) ; its avoidance thus yields more precise chebyshevmoments @xmath81 , especially for @xmath507 .",
    "( vii ) however , this improvement is numerically expensive : the increased effective bandwidth neccessitates larger expansion orders @xmath55 , which in turn requires a higher mps dimension ( here @xmath508 ) .",
    "( viii ) for the present model , it was possible to calculate several thousand moments without encountering numerical instabilities ; this illustrates the fact that the chebychev recurrence relations are _ numerically stable_.    finally , let us address ( ix ) the wiggly artefacts near @xmath502 .",
    "they reflect the fact that chempswas _ separately _ applied to the positive and negative branches of the spectral function , @xmath509 , shown in zooms in figs .  [",
    "fig : rmlm - all](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "these are proportional to step functions @xmath362 , and hence abruptly dip to zero for @xmath510 or @xmath474 , respectively .",
    "the wiggly artefacts correspond gibbs oscillations decorating these sharps dips .",
    "this problem can be avoided by performing a single chebyshevexpansion of the _ sum _ , @xmath511 , which is a smooth function and leads to the perfectly smooth long - dashed line in figs .",
    "[ fig : rmlm - all](b , c ) .",
    "this improvement comes at roughly twice the numerical cost , since it requires a doubling of the spectral range to @xmath512 $ ] : this implies a slight but obvious modification of the transformations from @xmath16 to @xmath34 and from @xmath138 to @xmath33 to account for the shifted range of @xmath16 ; and a doubling of @xmath513 and hence of the expansion order @xmath55 required to achieve a specified resolution .",
    "the main conclusions from our chempscalculations for the rlm are as follows : the strategy of using twice the spectral width as effective bandwidth ( @xmath198 ) and performing energy truncation ( ( a ) ) is a satisfactory compromise between efficiency ( only a few hundred chebyshevmoments are needed ) and accuracy ( for which energy truncation is the main limiting factor ) . if desired , better results can be obtained by using the full bandwidth ( @xmath514 ) and thus avoiding energy truncation , albeit at the cost of significantly increasing the required expansion order by the factor @xmath515 .",
    "nevertheless , the calculation of chebyshevmoments @xmath81 with very large @xmath1 is feasible due to the remarkably numerical stability of chebychev recurrence relations .",
    "it was shown very recently@xcite that the performance of the continued - fraction approach can be substantially improved by iteratively calculating its expansion coefficients using an adaptive lanczos - vector method .                                    in principle",
    ", the lanczos algorithm also provides the maximal eigenvalue .",
    "however , in dmrg the lanczos gets restarted at every site with the currently known ground state and thus the return maximal energy will no longer approach @xmath516 as the ground state converges ."
