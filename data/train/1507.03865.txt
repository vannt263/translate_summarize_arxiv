    "the shape of an object is a fundamental source of information for recognition . while color and texture information are also important ( see @xcite ) , line drawings , which discard texture and color , are usually sufficient to recognize an object .",
    "furthermore , infants generalize object labels on the basis of shape similarity rather than color similarity ( see @xcite ) , suggesting that shape plays a key role in categorization . in order to understand how we recognize and categorize objects , therefore , it is crucial to study how information about shape is represented .",
    "since the space of shapes is infinite dimensional , the brain likely approximates it using a lower number of dimensions in order to make the problem more tractable . for comparison",
    ", it can be useful to consider the example of color . like",
    "the space of shapes , the space of light spectra is infinite dimensional .",
    "however , with three dimensions it is possible to model accurately the space of perceptually discernible colors ( see @xcite ) . in the same vein",
    ", we can look for finite dimensional spaces that encompass the perceptually discernible shapes .",
    "recent work ( see @xcite ) found that a model with approximately @xmath0 dimensions explains accurately a large amount of the variance in the object recognition errors and similarity judgments of human participants .",
    "however , models of this type leave open the question of whether the dimensionality of shape space is the same in the neighborhoods of all shapes .",
    "in addition , the most relevant dimensions for recognition might differ in the neighborhood of different shapes .",
    "for example , the relevant dimensions for discriminating between individual faces and for discriminating between buildings might not be the same , and thus different low - dimensional approximations of the space of shapes could be used in the two neighborhoods .",
    "this possibility is compatible with the differential involvement of different brain regions within temporal cortex in the processing of different object categories ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our interdisciplinary research project aims to introduce techniques to individuate lower dimensional subspaces that locally approximate the space of perceptually discernible shapes .",
    "a couple of crucial remarks are in order here .",
    "first , our approach aims to model shape discriminability rather than object recognition accuracy . in other words , it is a model of perception rather than a model of perceptual categorization ( in this respect , it is quite similar to the case of color space ) .",
    "the choice of investigating discriminability is based on the idea that a common representation of shape underlies both shape discrimination and judgements of perceptual similarity that are at the basis of perceptual categorization .",
    "this idea is supported by the evidence currently available ( see @xcite ) .",
    "next , our goal is to represent shapes locally rather than constructing a single lower dimensional space underlying the representation of all shapes .",
    "this choice is a consequence of the aim to model perceptual discriminability : different local spaces seem necessary to account for the large variety of shapes we can perceptually discriminate .    for modeling shape space in the neighborhood of a fixed shape spline curves will be used .",
    "spline curves can approximate contours closely , they enjoy elegant mathematical properties , and their computational complexity is relatively low .",
    "for all these reasons , splines are widely considered to be an ideal tool to approximate signals ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the use of b - splines for digital signal processing has a long history ( at least since @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we employ spline curves to address the following approximation problem : given a plane contour @xmath1 construct a ( parametric ) spline curve  @xmath2 of a fixed degree @xmath3 well approximating @xmath1 .",
    "the procedure ( described in section [ algorithmsec ] and based on section [ basicspline ] ) is divided into three parts : use of strengthened edge detection techniques to extract the points of the contour @xmath1 ; computation of the spline curve @xmath2 , performed by solving a least squares approximation problem ( see problem [ lsapproxproblem ] and subsequent discussion ) ; plot of the computed spline curve ( and , eventually , comparison with  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the spline approximation part ( second part ) is the core of the presented procedure and , as it is well known to the experts ( see for instance @xcite ) , an important issue for it is the choice of knots .",
    "at the end of section [ basicspline ] we recall three of the most used parametrization methods ( uniform , chord length and centripetal ) .",
    "the chord length parametrization method is then chosen to show a concrete example ( see figures [ origimage]-[caso4 ] ) .",
    "the main reference for this section is @xcite .    bzier curves and , after their introduction in 1946 ( see @xcite ) ,",
    "spline curves have been widely used to construct smooth curves from a given set of points in an efficient and numerically stable way .",
    "their geometrical construction is essentially based on recursive convex combinations of curves of smaller degrees .",
    "namely :    [ splinecurve ] let @xmath4 be positive integers , with @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be @xmath7 control points , and let @xmath8 be the knot vector , which is assumed to be a nondecreasing sequence of @xmath9 real numbers , that is , @xmath10 .",
    "the functions @xmath11 are recursively defined in the following way : we set @xmath12 , for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where possible division by zero is resolved by the convention that a division by zero is zero",
    ". the _ ( parametric ) spline curve  @xmath17 of degree @xmath3 with control points @xmath18 and knots @xmath19 _ is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the piecewise constant functions defined by @xmath22    due to their special construction , spline curves enjoy many important geometrical properties , such as local dependence on the control points , being contained in the control polygon , and so on .",
    "a crucial fact is that every spline curve @xmath17 can be written as a linear combination of special univariate polynomials ( the b - splines , see definition  [ b - splines ] ) with the control points as coefficients ( see theorem  [ splinesasbsplines ] ) .",

    "the notion of linear combination of b - splines , also called spline function , is formalized in the following definition .    [ splinefunctions ]",
    "let @xmath4 be positive integers , with @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath34 be a nondecreasing sequence of reals , and let @xmath39 be the @xmath7 b - splines of degree @xmath3 with knots @xmath38 .",

    "@xmath38 _ , and @xmath43 are called the _ b - spline coefficients _ of @xmath44 .",
    "now we consider the approximation problem .",
    "the method is based on the standard least squares approach , in which classically the function to minimize is the sum of squared errors committed at the given data points . the problem can be formulated as follows .",
    "[ lsapproxproblem ] * ( least squares approximation problem ) * let @xmath45 ; given data @xmath46 and a spline space @xmath47 whose knot vector @xmath48 satisfies @xmath49 for @xmath50 , find a spline function @xmath51 which solves the minimization problem @xmath52    it is easy to see that this is a ls problem which can be expressed in matrix form as follows : find @xmath53 s.t .",

    "finally , we address the following problem : suppose we are given a set @xmath59 of @xmath60 points in @xmath61 , and we want to construct a ( parametric ) spline curve @xmath1 of degree @xmath3 that approximates the points . from problem [ lsapproxproblem ] ,",
    "recalling definition [ splinefunctions ] , in order to define a spline space @xmath42 it is clear that a knot vector @xmath38 is required .",
    "obviously , different choices of the knot vector lead to different spline spaces and , consequently , to different approximating spline curves . in the literature",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , there are various competing parametrization methods , such as :    1 .   _ uniform : _ @xmath62 and @xmath63 , for @xmath64 .",

    "centripetal : _ @xmath62 and @xmath66 , for @xmath64 .    in this paper we mainly focused on the chord length method , though the procedure for approximating plane contours using",
    "spline curves ( described in section [ algorithmsec ] ) has been implemented with all three parametrization methods .",
    "in this section we describe an algorithmic procedure for approximating a given plane contour using spline curves .",
    "the procedure can be divided into three parts :    1 .",
    "acquisition of a digital image reproducing a silhouette ; extraction of the contour @xmath1 by strengthened edge detection techniques ; 2 .",
    "computation of the spline curve , approximation of the contour @xmath1 ; 3 .",
    "plot of the computed spline curve ( and eventually , comparison with @xmath1 ) .",
    "accordingly , the implementation of the algorithm is divided into three steps : the first and the third step , corresponding to parts i and iii , are implemented in matlab , using well - established built - in functions ; the second step , corresponding to part ii , is implemented in c++ language , using routines both of cocoalib @xcite , a gpl c++ library  the mathematical kernel for the computer algebra system cocoa-5 , and of the numerical library gsl - gnu scientific library @xcite . note that part  ii is the core of the algorithm : based on section [ basicspline ] , and in particular on problem [ lsapproxproblem ] and the subsequent discussion , its implementation requires as input :    * an affine set of points in @xmath61 ( resulting from the edge detection on the input image ) ; * a parameter @xmath7 , corresponding to the number of polynomial patches ; * a parameter @xmath3 , corresponding to the degree of polynomials ; * a parametrization method ( see section [ basicspline ] ) .",
    "it returns as output :    * a coefficient vector defining the piecewise polynomial function made up of @xmath7 patches of degree @xmath3 ; * the corresponding least square error .",
    "just to give an idea , we consider the silhouette of a horse , represented in figure [ origimage ] .",
    "using classical edge detection techniques , the contour of the horse is extracted ( see figure [ edge ] ) and stored as a set of @xmath67 points in @xmath61 . the chord length parametrization method is chosen ( see section [ basicspline ] ) , and contour approximations are obtained through computations with different values of the parameters , namely @xmath68 ( see figure [ caso1 ] ) , @xmath69 ( see figure [ caso2 ] ) , @xmath70 ( see figure [ caso3 ] ) and @xmath71 ( see figure [ caso4 ] ) .",
    "we observe that there is a substantial difference in the approximation quality comparing the cases @xmath72 and @xmath73 , whereas we notice a slight improvement passing from the cases with @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "we have presented a novel procedure to approximate a plane contour by piecewise polynomial functions , depending on various parameters ( degree , number of local patches , selection of knots ) . in order to optimize our choice of parameters",
    ", we plan to perform a series of behavioural experiments by adopting the following procedure .",
    "first , a set of contours will be selected , representing both shapes of daily life objects and meaningless curves .",
    "next , every contour will be approximated by different splines , obtained by varying parameters in such a way that each approximation is perceptually closed to the original shape .",
    "then , participants will be asked to perform a same / different task .",
    "finally , the experimental results shall allow us to individuate a lower dimensional spline space approximating the space of perceptually discriminable shapes in a neighborhood of a fixed shape .",
    "at this point , it will be possible to ask questions about shape representations such as :    1 .",
    "is the dimensionality of the space of perceptually discriminable shapes the same for neighborhoods of different shapes ?",
    "2 .   in particular , does the dimensionality of the space of perceptually discriminable shapes change as a function of experience ?",
    "3 .   as a consequence ,",
    "do neighborhoods of real objects have higher dimensionality than neighborhoods of meaningless curves ?"
