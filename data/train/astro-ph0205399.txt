    "the first gravitational lens system discovered , q0957 + 561 @xcite , has become the most observed gravitational mirage .",
    "this system has been the target of continuous monitoring in optical and radio wavelenghts .",
    "the early works by @xcite ; and @xcite , were followed by other recent monitoring , as those by @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "three outstanding events can be noticed during these twenty years of monitoring .",
    "firstly , the existence of a large timescale microlensing ( of several years ) .",
    "the analysis made by @xcite with data corresponding to the period 19791996 clearly shows its presence .",
    "next , a strong 0.13mag intrinsic brightening of q0957 + 561 in two months was detected by @xcite . and finally , @xcite noticed a possible microlensing event with maximum amplitude of 0.05 mag and a timescale of 90 days . the sharp drop detected by kundic et al . allowed to solve the long - standing problem concerning the  short \" ( @xmath0 days ) and  long \" ( @xmath1 days ) time delays between the a and b components of the system .",
    "the observations confirmed that the short value was the correct one @xcite , constraining the time delay between 410 and 440 days .",
    "moreover , this feature allowed to obtain a first accurate value for the delay ( 417@xmath23 days , kundic et al . 1997 ; 424@xmath23 days , oscoz et al .",
    "this robust estimate lead to search for the existence of possible microlensing events @xcite , but no other event of the type reported by @xcite has been detected ( see gil ",
    "merino et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the instituto de astrofsica de canarias gravitational lensing group started a long - term monitoring program on this system in 1996 , with the 0.82-m iac80 telescope at the observatorio del teide in tenerife , spain .",
    "our set of almost 500 individual observations in @xmath3 band , together with several hundreds of points in @xmath4 band , constitutes one of the largest photometric database of a gravitational lens system .",
    "the application of a new data reduction method ( to improve the original aperture photometry ) , and the development of a new procedure to estimate the time delay , gave a value of @xmath5 days @xcite .",
    "the accuracy in the time delay was improved furthermore by including data from other groups in the period 19841999 and by using several statistical methods for the calculations .",
    "a new value of @xmath6 days was derived @xcite .",
    "to date , we have only published the data corresponding to the campaigns from 1996 to 1999 ( oscoz et al . 2001 ) .",
    "a summary of the last two observing campaigns ( 10/1999  06/2000 and 09/2000  06/2001 ) are shown in table 1 .",
    "( full data corresponding to all the observing campaigns dates , brightness and errors of the individual data can be found at http://www.iac.es/project/quasar/mserra/meth.html ) .",
    "each data point is the result of averaging several individual measurements .",
    "the reduction procedure was done by means of the _ pho2com _ iraf task ( for a complete description of _ pho2com _ , see serra - ricart et al .",
    "once the final light curves were obtained , the data were checked to eliminate inconsistent measurements : some points are affected by systematic effects , and show strong and _ simultaneous _ ( non time - shifted ) variations in both components .",
    "these points are the result of bad weather conditions or problems with the ccd and/or the telescope .",
    "the number of discarded data points was always small ( 18 out of 401 ) .",
    "the final light curves of our monitoring campaign ranging from 25.02.1996 to 06.06.2001 in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands are presented in figure 1 .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of the a and b components were derived by comparing the instrumental fluxes with those of two reference stars ( d and h , see serra - ricart et al .",
    "1999 ) . from the scatter in the comparison star differential light curve",
    "we estimate that the photometry is accurate to 23 per cent . in figure 1",
    "a delay of 422.6 days has been applied to the b component , but no magnitude correction has been applied to the data set , both the a and b magnitude are the real ones . it is obvious that the behavior of the light curves shows epochs in which both components fade , followed by epochs in which they brighten , in a quasi - periodic way .",
    "this is the general trend observed during the 2000 campaign .",
    "however , a conspicuous behavior can be seen in the 2001 campaign , where a brightening of more than 0.2 mag in component a can be observed between day @xmath7 jd2451500 and day @xmath7 jd2452065 .",
    "this behavior is evident when only the points corresponding to the 2001 campaign are represented .",
    "this is shown in the upper panel of figure 2 , where the b component is not delayed , and the data have been averaged into 10-day bins to reduce the noise and to clearly show the trend of both components .",
    "every year , when the observing season for q0957 + 561 is finished , the obtained data are reduced by the iac group together with the data from previous campaigns .",
    "a possible explanation of the trend appearing in the a component during the 2001 campaign is that the data have been badly obtained and/or reduced , leading to a wrong magnitude estimate .",
    "however , a mistake in the reduction procedure would lead to changes in the whole data , not only in the points corresponding to the latest year .",
    "moreover , only the a component points show this variation , while the b data remain almost constant ( see the upper panel of fig .",
    "these facts demonstrate that a wrong reduction process or a failure in data acquisition can not be the explanation for this trend in the image a light curve .",
    "differential photometry between both comparison stars ( see section 2 ) has been performed in order to check for their stability .",
    "no significant variability in the differential light curve is observed , as can be seen in the lower panel of figure 2 .",
    "so , the brightening of the a component is certainly not due to any change of the reference stars .",
    "two different explanations for the monotonous increase in the brightness of the a component of q0957 + 561 are proposed : ( i ) it is intrinsic variability of the source ; ( ii ) it is due to a microlensing event , either a short - time one ( months to a few years ) or the cessation of the historical microlensing ( about twenty years , see pelt et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that there have been several epochs of remarkable intrinsic variability in the last 5 years .",
    "however , these changes are always less than 0.15 mag ; for example @xmath8 mag between jd 2450300 and jd 2450500 or @xmath9 mag between jd 2451100 and jd 2451300 . note that the sharp drop detected by @xcite had an amplitude of 0.13 mag .",
    "so , if the trend found in the 2001 observing campaign is the consequence of intrinsic variability of the source , it would be the largest intrinsic variation ever found , with an optical flux increase of at least 0.2 mag .",
    "the large brightening now detected would make it relatively easy to obtain a final confirmation of the time delay between both components of q0957 + 561 .",
    "in addition , and perhaps even more important , it would allow to obtain this delay independently of the method selected , finally solving the controversy of the last few years .",
    "thus , a monitoring of q0957 + 561 until 2004 would be crucial to improve our knowledge of both the time delay and the robustness of several statistical methods .      as stated before , a microlensing event of more than ten years",
    "is being produced in q0957 + 561 .",
    "@xcite made a statistical analysis of the q0957 + 561 light curves from the first 17 years ( 19791996 ) with data from schild et al .",
    "( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/@xmath7rschild ) , princeton university ( kundic et al .",
    "1997 ) and the iac group first observing campaign ( oscoz et al .",
    "these observational data led them to obtain a time delay of 416.3@xmath21.7 days , and then to calculate the differential light curve between both components of q0957 + 561 ( taking into account this value for the time delay ) .",
    "pelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) finally concluded the existence of a first variation of 0.25 mag in about 6 years , followed by a quiet phase of about 8 years without variability over 0.05 mag .",
    "the historical differential light curve is presented in figure 3 , where only data from schild et al . and",
    "the first four campaigns of the iac group campaigns have been used .",
    "a time delay of 422.6 days has been applied to b component data , and only the annual averages are presented . the analysis made by pelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) shows that objects with mass of @xmath10 can explain the 0.25mag event .",
    "they also stated that the existence of objects with a mass as high as @xmath11 was possible , although they are quite unlikely . a remarkable fact",
    "since the beginning of this event is that component b remains brighter than component a. however , the differential light curve does not clearly lead to the interpretation of long term microlensing .",
    "the shape of this curve does not match the one expected for a microlensing event , and it is difficult to explain the dip between day 5000 and day 6000 .",
    "a point favouring the historical microlensing interpretation is that component a is brighter than b in the line emission ( angonin - willaime & vanderriest 1995 ) , which is supposed to be not affected by microlensing .    in any case ,",
    "a point against the explanation of the observed variability in the 2001 campaign as the end of the historical microlensing is the fact that this large timescale microlensing took six years ( @xmath7 1983 - 1988 ) to vary 0.25 mag , while about the same variation has been measured now in only a year .",
    "another interesting explanation to this large change in brightness is that it can be produced by a short timescale ( from several months to a few years ) microlensing event . until now",
    ", no short timescale microlensing event has been completely confirmed in q0957 + 561 , although some observing campaigns with several participating observatories have been carried out @xcite .",
    "even the possible microlensing event reported by @xcite is not entirely convincing .",
    "this author , with his own data and a time delay of 404 days , found amplitude peaks of 0.05 mag and 90 days long in the microlensing curves .",
    "this phenomenon was interpreted as short timescale microlensing due to objects with 10@xmath12 mass .",
    "refsdal et al .",
    "( 2000 ) employed the microlensing light curve by pelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to restrict the microlens mass .",
    "these authors concluded that the lens mass could be restricted to values in the interval 10@xmath13 - 5@xmath14 .",
    "another analysis was performed by schmidt & wambsganss ( 1998 ) with data in the @xmath15 band by kundic et al .",
    "( 1997 , two observing campaigns : 1994 , december to 1995 , may and 1995 , november to 1996 , july ) and a time delay of 417 days .",
    "no variation larger than 0.05 mag was found in the differential light curve .",
    "two conclusions were derived : ( i ) machos with masses in the interval 10@xmath12 - 10@xmath16 can be excluded for a quasar with a radius less than 10@xmath17 pc ; and ( ii ) there were no evidence of short timescale events . lately ,",
    "wambsganss et al . ( 2000 ) added to the previous light curves the data obtained until 1998 in the same band and with the same telescope , detecting again no microlensing with amplitude larger than 0.05 mag .",
    "they could extend the previous limits , excluding an halo only made by machos with masses between 10@xmath13 and 10@xmath18 for a quasar with radius less than 10@xmath17 pc .    finally , gil - merino et al .",
    "( 2001 ) performed an exhaustive analysis of the microlensing signal obtained with the iac 1996 , 1997 , and 1998 observing campaigns in the @xmath3 band .",
    "they selected a delay of @xmath19 days ( serra - ricart et al .",
    "gil - merino et al .",
    "concluded that : ( i ) no 3 months duration and 0.05 mag amplitude events are found in the microlensing light curves , so these events do not occur in a continuous way ; ( ii ) from a conservative point of view , the amplitude of any microlensing signal must be in the interval [ -0.05 mag , + 0.05 mag ] ( the same limit found by pelt et al .",
    "1998 and wambsganss et al .",
    "2000 ) ; and ( iii ) the small variability observed in the differential light curves could be originated , in a natural way , by observational noise mechanisms .",
    "we present in this letter a large , @xmath20-mag , brightening of component a of the gravitational lens system q0957 + 561 .",
    "the event occurs between day @xmath7 jd2451500 and day @xmath7 jd2452065 , our last observing date , so its amplitude could be even larger .",
    "two different alternatives are offered to explain this variation : intrinsic variability or microlensing .",
    "the historical light curve of q0957 + 561 presents several large variations in amplitude .",
    "some of them are fast , as the 0.13mag sharp drop detected by @xcite , whereas others , larger in magnitude ( but always below 0.15 mag ) , are relatively slow ( see figure 1 )",
    ". however , the detected 2001 variability in component a , if intrinsic , would be the largest one ever reported in this quasar , allowing so to obtain a confirmation of the time delay independently of the method employed .    alternatively , the observed brightening could be due to a microlensing event . as a possible explanation",
    ", it could correspond to short timescale microlensing ( months to years ) .",
    "microlensing events of this type have been detected in several gravitational lenses , specially in q2237 + 0305 , where they are almost routinely detected ( a noticeable 0.15mag microlensing in component a of q2237 + 0305 has been recently reported ; wozniak et al . 2000 ; alcalde et al .",
    "2002 ) . on the contrary , in q0957 + 561",
    "it would be the first secure event of this type detected ( see schild 1996 ; gil  merino et al .",
    "another possibility is that it could indicate the end of the historical microlensing which started in 1983 ( pelt et al .",
    ". however , the variation seems too fast to correspond to the cessation of such a microlensing event .    in any case",
    ", the definitive answer will only come after the observation of component b during 2002 .",
    "so , an exhaustive monitoring of q0957 + 561 from several observing groups is necessary from now until summer 2002 to study the behavior of component b ( if the variability is intrinsic , the same behavior will appear in b component since @xmath7 jd2452000 , april 2001 , until @xmath7 jd2452600 , august 2002 ) , and at least during 2003 to cover all the event .",
