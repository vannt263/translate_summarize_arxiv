    "future increase in the number of mobile devices , using data - hungry applications , will lead to highly dense cellular networks , demanding high capacity performance with the least possible system overhead .",
    "interference alignment ( ia ) , introduced by maddah - ali , motahari and khandani in [ 1 ] and cadambe and jafar in [ 2 ] , allows in the @xmath0-user interference channel @xmath3 degrees of freedom ( dof ) to be achieved , assuming global perfect csi .",
    "ia differs from other interference management schemes , as it attempts to align interference , rather than avoid , reduce or cancel it .",
    "however , ia requirement of full csi is infeasible and costly .",
    "the scheme of blind ia ( bia ) , presented by wang , gou and jafar in [ 3 ] and jafar in [ 4 ] , for certain network scenarios , can achieve full dof in the absence of csi at the transmitters ( csit ) , reducing considerably the system overhead . additionally , in [ 5 ] jafar introduces how the bia scheme can be employed in certain cellular networks , including heterogeneous networks , by seeing frequency reuse as a simple form of ia . in [ 6 ]",
    ", jafar introduces the topological interference management ( tim ) scheme , which can be considered as a form of bia in which the position of every user in the cell(s ) , and therefore the strength of their channels , is taken into account . requiring only knowledge of the network s topology at the transmitters ,",
    "1/2 dof can be achieved for every user in the siso broadcast channel ( bc ) , by treating weak interference links as noise . moreover , in [ 7 ] sun and jafar discuss the implications of increasing the number of receive antennas resulting in an increase on the network s dof .    in [ 8 ] , saito et al .",

    "multiple users are superimposed in the power domain and successful interference cancellation ( sic ) reception is performed at the decoding stage , ultimately improving the capacity and throughput performance . furthermore , benjebbour et al . in [ 9 ]",
    "present the benefits of noma and discuss its performance considering adaptive modulation and coding , and frequency - domain scheduling .",
    "moreover , ding and co - authors in [ 10]-[11 ] discuss the superior performance of noma in terms of ergodic sum rates and the importance of power allocation , and a cooperative noma scheme where users with higher channel gains have prior information about other users messages , respectively .",
    "finally , ding , fan and poor in [ 12 ] study user pairing on two noma schemes and how it affects the sum rate . the first scheme , f - noma , with fixed power allocation , pairs users with very distinctive channel conditions , whereas the second one , cr - noma , inspired by cognitive radio , pairs users with similar channel conditions .",
    "in this paper , based on [ 6 ] and [ 8 ] , we introduce a hybrid tim - noma scheme in general @xmath0-user siso cells .",
    "our contribution is the combination of the tim and noma schemes , in a two - stage decoding way , dividing users in @xmath1 groups . in the first - stage , we apply the tim scheme to manage `` inter - group '' interference , with no need to ignore weak interference links . in the second - stage , we employ noma , at every group of users separately , to manage `` intra - group '' interference through sic .",
    "finally , we discuss how the sum rate performance of the system is significantly improved with the employment of the hybrid scheme when compared to time division multiple access ( tdma ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the general description of the hybrid scheme , with the aid of an example model with @xmath4 users , including the determination of the transmit power , and the two - stage decoding process .",
    "section iii presents the achievable rate formula for every user in the network .",
    "finally , section iv gives an overview of our results , illustrated with graphs , discussing how the users distance from the basestation , and the amount of interference they end up considering as noise affects their performance .",
    "consider the broadcast channel ( bc ) network , as shown in figure 1 , for @xmath4 users . at the siso",
    "bc of the cell , there is one transmitter @xmath5 with 1 antenna , and @xmath0 users equipped with 1 antenna each .",
    "transmitter @xmath5 has 1 message to send to every user , and moreover , when it transmits to user @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , it causes interference to all the other @xmath8 users in the macrocell .",
    "the radius of the cell is considered as @xmath9 @xmath10 , and the distance of every user from the basestation is given by @xmath11 .",
    "furthemore , users are divided into @xmath1 groups @xmath12 in such a way so that there are always @xmath13 users from the remaining @xmath13 groups separating 2 users from the same group , and to place users with considerable difference in their channel strengths in the same group .",
    "the operation is performed over @xmath1 time slots , over which we assume that channel coefficients remain the same .",
    "the transmitter has only knowledge of the topology of the network .    according to the noma scheme , described fully in [ 8]-[9 ] , users are multiplexed , in the power domain , at the transmitters , and then at the receivers , signal separation is performed based on sic .",
    "decoding is performed based on an optimal order ( in the order of descreasing channel gains divided by the power of noise and interference ) , resulting in every user being able to decode the signals of users coming before them in the decoding order .",
    "the general concept of the hybrid tim - noma scheme , is that every user , in order to recover its desired signal , uses the principles of tim to manage interference coming from transmissions to users not belonging to their own group ( i.e. their channel strengths are quite similar ) , and the principles of noma to manage interference due to transmissions to users belonging in their own group ( i.e. their channel strengths are quite different ) .    according to our research",
    ", noma seems to work better when applied to users with considerable difference in their channel gains .",
    "therefore , introducing tim in the noma scheme , and splitting users into groups , provides a solution for the cases where users gains do not differ much .",
    "the aforementioned reason , combined with fact that both schemes do not require csit , as discussed in [ 6 ] and [ 9 ] , results in a very smooth and successful combination of them .    in this paper",
    ", we will use an example model , to present the hybrid tim - noma scheme , where we consider @xmath4 users , @xmath14 time slots and groups @xmath15 .",
    "users @xmath16,@xmath17 and @xmath18 are in group @xmath19 , and users @xmath20 and @xmath21 are in group @xmath22 . finally , the users distances from the transmitter are given by : @xmath23 @xmath10 , @xmath24 @xmath10 , @xmath25 @xmath10 , @xmath26 @xmath10 , @xmath27 @xmath10 .",
    "users cell .",
    "users are divided into @xmath14 groups : group @xmath19 ( aligned along @xmath28 ) with users @xmath29 and group @xmath22 ( aligned along @xmath30 ) with users @xmath31 . ]",
    "the @xmath32 signal at receiver @xmath6 is given by :    @xmath33    due to the users different locations , channel coefficients are statistically independent , and follow an i.i.d .",

    "moreover , @xmath39 denotes the path loss , and @xmath40 is the path loss exponent considered for an urban environment , i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "finally , @xmath42 denotes independent additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at the input of receiver @xmath6 .    taking into consideration the position of each user @xmath6 in the cell , and therefore its distance @xmath11 from the basestation ,",
    "ordering users increasingly , in terms of @xmath11 , the following relationship , regarding their channel gains normalized by the noise power ( assuming the same noise power for all receivers ) , follows :    @xmath43    with user @xmath16 being very close to the basestation and user @xmath0 at the edge of the cell .",
    "therefore , weaker channels , of users being far from the basestation , need to be boosted , such that the following holds for their transmit power :    @xmath44    the energy of the input symbol @xmath45 , of each user @xmath6 , is defined as :    @xmath46=1\\ ] ]    for every user @xmath6 in the cell , we choose to take its transmitted power given by : @xmath47    where @xmath48 is a constant determined by power considerations .",

    "in the network , there will be @xmath1 precoding vectors @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , which are @xmath32 unit vectors .",

    "managing interference coming from transmissions from users not belonging in their own group , and based on the example given in [ 6 , section 4 ] , every receiver @xmath6 , of the same group @xmath64 , can partially recover their signal by projecting their received signal @xmath69 along @xmath65 , which by definition is orthogonal to all the other @xmath13 precoding vectors @xmath66 , for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    ", the ber performance of our example model was investigated .",
    "based on our findings , the distance of every user @xmath6 from the transmitter is a key feature that determines the ber performance of every user . in figure 2",

    "moreover , in figure 3 , a comparison between the ber performance of users shown in figure 2 , and the performance they would achieve if all other users were shut down , is shown . for matters of simplicity ,",
    "only users 1 and 5 are studied , as the performances of the remaining users lie in between .",
    "as it can be observed , generally , ber performances are better when only one user is active .",
    "furthermore , the closer a user is to the transmitter , the less improvement we observe in their performance , in the case where all other users are inactive .",
    "the rate of the network will be a function of the user s distance from the basestation and the amount of interference considered as noise , if any , as shown in ( 21 ) . in figure 4",
    ", it can be observed that the rate decreases with the distance of the user from the transmitter and the amount of interference considered as noise . in particular ,",
    "user @xmath16 , who is the closest to the basestation and manages all interference during the decoding stage , achieves the best rate performance . on the contrary",
    ", user @xmath18 , who is the furthest from the basestation and considers all `` intra - group '' interference as noise , achieves the worst performance .",
    "furthermore , figure 5 depicts a comparison between the rate for every user shown in figure 4 , and the rate they would achieve if all other users were shut down , as given by ( 22 ) .",
    "again , for matters of simplicity only the cases of users 1 and 5 are shown .",
    "as it can observed , rate performances are better when only one user is active .",
    "the most important and interesting observation is that the sum rate for the hybrid scheme , for high snr values , is better than the sum rate of tdma , proving the gain in terms of rate that the employment of the hybrid scheme results in .",
    "finally , this gain is depicted clearly in figure 6 , where the value of the ratio @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the sum rate of the hybrid scheme and @xmath117 is the sum rate for tdma , is studied for a range of snr values . for snr values greater than 11 db ,",
    "the performance of the hybrid scheme achieves at least double the rate that would be achieved by tdma .",
    "overall , this paper introduces a novel hybrid scheme that can be employed in the siso bc of a cell , with @xmath0 users divided into @xmath1 groups .",
    "the hybrid scheme combines basic principles of the tim and noma schemes , by treating `` inter - group '' interference and `` intra - group '' interference separately and by a different method .",
    "moreover , the employment of tim in the cases where users gains do not differ much , solves performance issues that were faced by noma .",
    "furthermore , the system s complexity is reduced , providing flexibility , when compared to the noma scheme , without decreasing the rate performance that the system would have if noma was only applied . in general , the employment of the proposed scheme results in high data rates , very good ber performance , and reduced system overhead ( due to the absence of csit requirement ) .",
    "most interestingly , for high snrs , the total sum rate is higher than the sum rate for tdma , proving the gain in terms of sum rate the hybrid scheme results in .",
    "the non - complex concept of the hybrid tim - noma scheme introduced in this paper , suggests that it could be employed in dense networks , and potentially in heterogeneous networks once certain adjustments in the algorithm are made .",
