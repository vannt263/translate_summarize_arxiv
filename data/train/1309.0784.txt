    "consider now the third - order corrections to the energies , determined by the matrix @xmath158 .",
    "except for the lowest - lying states , there are no off - diagonal entries in @xmath169 ; this follows from the central result of  @xcite , since off - diagonal entries would break the degeneracy the authors prove to hold to @xmath0th order of perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , the third - order corrections to the energies are given by the diagonal entries of the matrix @xmath158 . as we show below",
    ", these entries are all zero , and thus there are no corrections of this order .",
    "let @xmath170 be a matrix .",
    "we will call @xmath170 an _ odd matrix _ if @xmath171 for all @xmath3 and all @xmath172 even ( including @xmath173 ) , and an _ even matrix _ if @xmath171 for all @xmath3 and all @xmath172 odd .",
    "even and odd matrices have the following properties under multiplication :    let @xmath170 and @xmath174 be odd @xmath175 matrices .",

    "@xmath180 since @xmath172 is odd and @xmath108 odd , @xmath181 is even and so @xmath182 because @xmath174 is an odd matrix .",

    "the proof for @xmath186 is analogous .",
    "the matrix @xmath142 is odd , while the matrix @xmath153 is even . by the lemmas above",
    ", @xmath191 must be odd .",
    "the diagonal entries of an odd matrix are all zero .",
    "this implies there are no third - order corrections to the energies , except for the lowest few energy levels .",
    "incidentally , the same argument can be used to show that the fifth - order corrections are zero .",
    "this appendix outlines the quantum jump method , the technique used in our simulations of the bec dimer in the presence of dissipation .    we start with a simulation time interval @xmath192 $ ] and an initial state described by a wavefunction @xmath193 .",
    "the time interval is divided into time steps @xmath194 . at each time step",
    "we act on the state with the time evolution operator , @xmath195 where the pseudo - hamiltonian @xmath196 consists of the standard bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath197 of equation  [ eq : hamiltonian ] and an extra term : @xmath198 in addition to the time evolution , each time step atoms are removed from the wells @xmath199 with probability @xmath200 where @xmath89 the atom loss rate from well @xmath90 .",
    "the time @xmath194 is taken to be sufficiently small that the possibility of multiple atoms being removed during one time step can be ignored .",
    "if an atom is removed , we update the wavefunction , @xmath201 and reduce the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "( the hilbert space of the dimer has dimension @xmath202 , where @xmath0 is the number of particles , so the problem shrinks as atoms are ejected . ) finally , regardless of whether an atom was removed or not , we renormalize the wavefunction .",
    "a surprising feature of this algorithm is that the time evolution differs from the dissipation - free case even when no atoms are removed .",
    "this is because the absence of a removal event reveals information about the system , changing the probability distribution over the well occupation numbers and so altering the wave functions . intuitively , if strong dissipation is applied to a well and yet no atoms are ejected from it , the well is likely to be empty .",
    "alternately , one may interpret the suppression of tunneling into the well as a manifestation of the quantum zeno effect  @xcite .",
    "see section 3 of  @xcite for a more detailed discussion and references devoted specifically to this paradoxical `` null measurement '' effect .",
    "the phase space of the semiclassical model of the bec dimer is a sphere ; representing it in a plane , as we have done in figures  [ fig : global_phase_space ] ,  [ fig : most_probable_states ] ,  [ fig : most_probable_states_l1 ] and  [ fig : dissipation_induced_coherence ] , requires a choice of projection . throughout this work ,",
    "we have used the cylindrical equal - area projection , also known as the lambert projection . in the lambert projection , the @xmath203 and @xmath204 coordinates on the map are proportional to the longitude @xmath7 ( polar angle ) and the cosine of the colatitude @xmath205 ( the usual @xmath6 coordinate of spherical coordinates ) .",
    "in other words , the lambert is an axial projection of the sphere onto a cylinder tangent at the equator .",
    "as its name suggests , the cylindrical equal - area projection preserves areas : any two regions on the sphere with equal areas @xmath206 are mapped to two regions on the map with equal areas @xmath207 .",
    "however , this projection deforms angles ( it is not conformal ) , as a circle on the sphere is mapped to an ellipse , the eccentricity of which increases towards the poles .    the lambert projection should not be confused with the mercator projection , defined by @xmath208 the mercator projection is conformal , mapping a circle anywhere on the sphere to a circle in the @xmath209 plane , but is not area - preserving : famously , mercator maps of the earth show south america to be smaller than greenland , though the former land mass is in fact some eight times larger . in addition , since @xmath210 as @xmath211 or @xmath212 , a mercator map must employ a @xmath213 cutoff and can not include the poles .",
    "some authors  @xcite have described their maps of the bloch sphere as being drawn in the mercator projection , but labeled the @xmath204 scale from @xmath214 to @xmath215 , suggesting they might have actually used the less well - known lambert ( in which @xmath216 and the poles are in the range of the map ) ."
