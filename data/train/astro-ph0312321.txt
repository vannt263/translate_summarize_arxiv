    "acs / hst _ , _ xmm _ , and _ chandra _ observations",
    ". the goals of this programme is to map out the large scale structures around clusters to trace the cluster assembly history and then to look into the galaxy properties as a function of environment along the structures to directly identify the environmental effects acting on galaxies during their assembly to higher density regions .",
    "this unique project is currently underway and just a preliminary result on the large scale structures is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "these two rich clusters at @xmath1=0.55 and 0.83 are imaged in multi optical bands with suprime - cam , and photometric redshifts  @xcite have been applied to efficiently remove foreground / background contaminations and to isolate the cluster member candidates ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "many substructures are now clearly seen around the main body of the clusters which tend to be aligned in filamentary structures extending to @xmath910  mpc scale across .",
    "although these structures should be confirmed spectroscopically later on , these already provide good evidence for cluster assembly in the hierarchical universe .",
    "@xcite have presented the environmental dependence of galaxy colours along the filamentary structures around the a851 cluster ( @xmath1=0.41 ) , and have shown that the galaxy colour changes rather sharply at relatively low density regions like galaxy groups along the filaments well outside of the cluster core . together with the similar findings in the local universe  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the environmental effects that truncate star formation are not the cluster specific phenomena such as ram - pressure stripping  @xcite but are found to be much wider spread into low density regions .",
    "it is important to extend this analysis to higher redshifts as the galaxy environment is expected to change dramatically during the course of vigorous assembly , which is probably related to the appearence of morphology - density relation  @xcite .",
    "and @xmath14 clusters , respectively , which are compared to the local counterpart from the 2mass survey ( dot - dashed curve ) . all the curves and the data points",
    "are normalised at 5@xmath1010@xmath15m@xmath16 so as to have the same amplitude .",
    "the theoretical predictions from a semi - analytic model  @xcite are presented for comparison , which are made for galaxies in the haloes whose circular velosities are greater than 1000  km / s at each epoch .",
    "the mass assembly of massive galaxies in the real universe is much faster than the hierarchical model prediction . ]    secondly , along the time axis , we present the stellar mass functions of galaxies in high-@xmath1 clusters constructed from deep near - infrared imaging ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the stellar mass function of galaixes derived from the @xmath19-band observations is a good tracer of mass assembly history of galaxies ( eg . , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "we have combined two @xmath4 clusters ( 3c336 and q1335 + 28 )  @xcite , and five @xmath14 clusters ( q0835 + 580 , q1126 + 101 , q1258 + 404 , q0139273 , and q2025155 )  @xcite@xcite@xcite to increase statistics .",
    "we have subtracted the control field counts taken from the literature  @xcite@xcite@xcite . applying the same technique described in @xcite",
    ", we construct the field - subtracted stellar mass functions of galaxies in high-@xmath1 clusters , primarily using @xmath18-band flux and also using @xmath20 colour as a measure of the m / l ratio .",
    "as shown , little evolution is observed since @xmath3 to the present - day ( 2mass clusters  @xcite ) , indicating that the mass assembly on galaxy scale is largely completed by @xmath14 in the cluster environment .",
    "this epoch of mass assembly of massive galaxies is earlier than the prediction of the hierarchical models as shown for comparison  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to trace back the stellar mass to even higher redshift to firstly identify the epoch of assembly of massive galaxies where they start to break down into pieces .",
    "recent deep nir observations in fact start to enter such formation epoch ( eg . , @xcite@xcite@xcite ) , and this aspect will be further extended by on - going and future space missions such as _ sirtf _ and _ astro - f_.",
    "galaxies in high density regions  @xcite . the solid line show the expected location of colour - magnitude sequence at @xmath4 assuming a passive evolution with @xmath21=5  @xcite .",
    "the deficit of both blue galaxies at the bright / massive end and the deficit of red galaxies at the faint / less - massive end are both clearly identified . ]      finally , along the mass axis , we present how the star formation history depends on the mass of the galaxies at @xmath4 based on the unique suprime - cam imaging data ( @xmath22 ) on the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) field .",
    "our data are both sufficiently deep ( @xmath23=25 , 6 - 10@xmath8 ) and wide ( 1.2 deg@xmath11 ) , which enable us for the first time to investigate the photometric properties of statistical sample of galaxies at @xmath4 down to @xmath24@xmath25 + 3 with respect to the passive evolution .",
    "we first identify five @xmath4 high density regions by applying colour cuts at 1.7@xmath26@xmath27@xmath28@xmath29@xmath262.0 and 0.8@xmath26@xmath30@xmath28@xmath29@xmath261.1 , which correspond to the colours of passively evolving galaxies at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we then combine these five regions ( amounting to 141 arcmin@xmath11 in total ) and subtract off the low density regions at @xmath4 ( scaled to the same area ) on the colour - magnitude diagram to isolate only @xmath4 galaxies in a statistical sense , since the both regions are expected to have the same amount of foreground / background contaminations .",
    "thus constructed field - corrected colour - magnitude diagram for @xmath4 galaxies in high density regions is shown in fig .",
    "most striking feature of this diagram is that there are two distinct populations , ` bright+red ' and ` faint+blue ' .",
    "more precisely , we show a deficit of red and faint galaxies below @xmath25 + 2 or 10@xmath15m@xmath16 in stellar mass and a lack of blue massive galaxies beyond @xmath25@xmath280.5 or 8@xmath1010@xmath15m@xmath16 in stellar mass .",
    "this bimodality in colour - magnitude distributions can be also seen in the colour - dependent stellar mass function shown in fig .",
    "red galaxies tend to be bright and show a bell - like shape , while the blue galaxies tend to be faint and show a much steeper faint - end slope .",
    "these results indicate the down - sizing in galaxy formation  @xcite , where star formation and mass assembly in massive galaxies take place early in the universe , while the star formation seems to be progressively shifted towards less massive systems as the universe ages . next obvious important step is to directly detect the brightening of such break luminosity or mass with increasing redshift  @xcite .",
