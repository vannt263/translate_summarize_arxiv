    "the paramagnetic meissner effect ( pme ) observed in small superconducting samples simply expresses the fact that the energy  of those samples decreases upon an increasing magnetic field .  a reentrant ( h , t ) phase diagram is one of the signals that characterizes this effect .",
    "this surprising effect has been seen both in conventional@xcite@xcite and in high tc superconductors @xcite .",
    "the behavior of nanometer - scale superconducting grains@xcite , which shows pauli paramagnetism@xcite in addition to other striking properties of finite electron systems , is outside the scope of this work which relies on the ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "metastability is one of the major ingredients that have been put forward to explain pme in conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "for example , in the ginzburg - landau approach of small size cylindrical samples at the upper critical field , the disbalance of the screening currents leads to a positive magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "but , in this case if the equilibrium transitions are only allowed , the pme disapears @xcite , and many mechanisms causing non equilibrium flux configuration have been proposed @xcite .",
    "however pme is known to occur for minimal energy configurations of some mesoscopic objects :  the little - parks @xcite ring is the most simple example that shows an alternating sequence of diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses as the magnetic field is increased . on the theoretical side",
    "this general behavior is known to be shared by all loop - like samples and moreover that pme appears the be stable against thermic fluctuations @xcite .    in the framework of the london approximation of the vortex phase of small superconducting disks , we have obtained magnetization curves which showed a pme , in good agreeement with the experimental observation @xcite , and made the analogy with the little - parks ring to interpret such a behavior of stable configurations @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give the reader a simple example of a mesoscopic ring - like superconducting film of which the paramagnetic response of the stable configurations can be tuned with the size of the central hole , and to show at which part of the ring ( inner or outer ) the nucleation of superconductivity is localized .    in section 2",
    "the upper critical field @xmath0 is calculated in the framework of the ginzburg - landau equation , and , if the size of the hole is large enough , the parts of the phase diagram where pme takes place are found . in section 3",
    "we show the two regions of the ring with opposite supercurrents which might give rise to a global positive magnetic moment . in section 4",
    "we give in more details our results for a ring with a small hole with @xmath1 for which there is only one paramagnetic domain and we also show the order parameter density profile that changes drastically when crossing the first order line .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "we shall follow quite closely the  method of bezryadin , buzdin and pannetier @xcite  in the case of a circular hole or of a disk@xcite , in order to obtain the phase diagram of a circular ring of external radius @xmath2 and width @xmath3 under a uniform magnetic field @xmath4 normal to the plane of the film sample .    in the case of  a thin film of thickness @xmath5 the effective screening length , @xmath6 , becomes very large and we may neglect the magnetic field energy in the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy functional : @xmath7     where @xmath8 .",
    "moreover due to the small size of the sample , we can take for the vector potential @xmath9 the potential of the uniform external applied field @xmath4 :    @xmath10    using polar coordinates ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , the equation for the normalized order parameter @xmath13  is : @xmath14   ^{2}\\psi + \\frac{r^{2}}{\\xi^{2}}(\\psi-\\psi^{3})=0\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath17 ,  @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  is the flux of the magnetic field across the plain disk ( with no hole ) .    in order to obtain the upper critical field @xmath0 @xcite , using the linearized version of the gl equation , we search for solutions of definite angular momentum @xmath21 of the form : @xmath22    then , in the present gauge , the super - current is tangent to the two circular insulating boundaries of the ring , and we may take the boundary conditions of the gl equation as follows : @xmath23    after reduction to kummers s equation , the general solution can be expressed as the linear combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite as follows :    @xmath26     where  @xmath27 , and where the two constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 have to be determined using the boundary conditions .    in practice , we have first obtained the ratio @xmath30 in terms of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath21 using the first condition , while the second condition has been numerically solved and allows us to obtain @xmath33 versus @xmath31  for each @xmath21 .",
    "then , for a given flux @xmath31 , the critical line @xmath34 is obtained by choosing the angular momentum value which minimizes  @xmath32 @xcite",
    ". the limiting cases of either a plain disk or a circular hole can be reached , using the same procedure , with @xmath35 in the first case and with @xmath36 in the second one .",
    "the little - parks ring @xcite , can be recovered using a very small value of @xmath37 , as shown on figure 1 .",
    "we see that paramagnetism starts just after the transition between angular momentum states @xmath38 and disapears for @xmath39 , until the next transition occurs . on figure 2",
    "we give the @xmath0 line for a ring with @xmath40 .",
    "the cusps , associated to jumps of the angular momentum , are clearly seen and three small paramagnetic domains are located above these transitions . for sake of comparison the full disk @xmath0 curve is shown on figure 3 , on which no such domains are seen ; such oscillations have been observed on micron - sized superconducting disks@xcite .",
    "our results give @xmath41 as the value under which paramagnetic domains are observed .",
    "in the state @xmath42 of angular momentum @xmath21 , the magnetic moment @xmath43  can be written as :   @xmath44    in fact the local density of magnetic moment is related to the value of the supercurrent : @xmath45    of which the components are : @xmath46    for a given flux and angular momentum , and when the ring is crossed from the inner edge ( @xmath47 ) up to the outer one ( @xmath48 , three various situations can be encountered acording to the sign of @xmath49:@xmath50    * the radial supercurrent density is negative everywhere on the ring for @xmath51 .",
    "this gives a uniform standard diamagnetic response .",
    "* the radial supercurrent density is positive everywhere on the ring for @xmath52  and gives a uniform paramagnetic response * the current flows changes its sign at a point  @xmath53  .",
    "thus one can distinguish two different regions on the ring : the inner part which contibutes positively to the total magnetic moment and the outer part which gives a diamagnetic contribution , with currents in the two regions flowing in opposite directions .",
    "let us comment figures 1 - 3 on this point .",
    "the ideal little - parks ring of fig1 ( with @xmath54 ) shows a sequence of uniform responses : @xmath55 is diamagnetic , whereas the reentrant part of @xmath56 is paramagnetic , etc ... and the supercurrent changes its sign for all half - integer values of @xmath57 .",
    "fig2 , which depicts the behavior of a thicker ring ( with @xmath58 ) , shows that apart the standard uniform diamagnetic response of the @xmath55 state , the @xmath56 state gives a  uniform paramagnetic response for small fields @xmath59  .",
    "the magnetization of all the other states results of the competition between the inner and the outer currents .",
    "the case of the plain disk ( fig3 ) is interesting although no paragnetism is observed on the global magnetization : all the non - zero angular momentum states have a central paramagnetic response and a larger diamagnetic one located on the periphery of the disk .",
    "in this section , we have choosen to treat more extensively the particular case of a small hole , @xmath60 , by solving the non - linear ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "this allows us to enter the superconducting region , and compute the densities of both the order parameter and the magnetization .",
    "in fact it can be shown that mixture of different angular momentum states can be neglected if only the lowest energy is searched for , so that we shall not consider such mixtures .",
    "because the two boundary conditions restrict @xmath13 at two different points , namely @xmath47 and @xmath61 , we have solved the non - linear gl equation  in two steps .",
    "we have used standard numerical routines which allowed us to obtain @xmath62 given the initial values @xmath63 and @xmath64 , then @xmath63 is found by solving @xmath65  for @xmath63 .    the @xmath0 line for the ring with @xmath60 is drawn on fig .",
    "4 . only one small paramagnetic domain shows up for fluxes @xmath66 with @xmath56 . on the inset of fig 4 , which is a zoom of the paramagnetic region ,",
    "we have drawn a fixed temperature path ( a - b ) with @xmath67 which crosses the first order transition line separating the @xmath55 and @xmath56 phases . a fixed flux path ( c - b ) with @xmath68 which lies entirely in the paramagnetic phase is also shown .",
    "the field dependence of the magnetization versus flux  along the path ( a - b ) is given on fig 5a , on which one sees the jump of the magnetic moment to a positive value when the first order line is crossed .",
    "this behavior should be compared with the smooth one of the magnetization along path ( c - b ) , in the paramagnetic phase at fixed field and versus temperature , on fig 5b .",
    "we now give on fig 6 the magnetization density at points a and b versus @xmath69 , i.e. when the ring is crossed from the inner circle to the outer one .",
    "as already explained in the prevoius section , one clearly sees that the inner part is paramagnetic while the outer one is diamagnetic and that the balance of the two results in a small pme effect .",
    "let us stress that , following this line of argument , and as said for disks in the previous section , one should observe for disks with very small holes a small domain with a positive local magnetic moment ( around the hole ) while there is no global pme effect .",
    "we discuss now the order parameter distribution across the ring . on fig 7 , comparing these densities , we find that the order parameter is larger in the inner part than in the outer part , at point a i.e. in the diamagnetic region . on the contrary , in the paramagnetic region , at points",
    "b , the order parameter is 30% larger in the vicinity of the outer edge than around the hole .",
    "figure 8 shows how the order parameter density profile changes when crossing the first order transition at @xmath70 at fixed temperature @xmath67 .",
    "we have plotted the values of @xmath71 on the two , inner and outer , boundaries of the ring for @xmath55 before the transition and for  @xmath56 after .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the regions of the ring where the order parameter is the largest , changes as the first order line is crossed , passing from the inner part before the transition to the outer one after .",
    "we have checked on the example of @xmath40 that this result should be general . in this last case",
    "it is observed that , sweeping the temperature range of @xmath56 from one transition point @xmath72 to the next one @xmath73 , the order parameter profile @xmath74 evolves from more populated on the inner edge to more populated on the outer one .",
    "let us note that , even though the superconducting parameter is maximal in this last region , a paramagnetic effect arises because of the large inner part of the disk in which the magnetization density is positive ( see fig .",
    "the paramagnetism of a mesoscopic object can obviously be due to any mechanism leading to non equilibrium configurations .",
    "however , at equilibrium , the pme depends strongly on the geometry of the sample and presumably can be observed in many cases much more involded than the toy model presented here .",
    "here we have shown that the giant vortex state of a pierced disk can exhibit pme in minimal energy configurations .",
    "the size of the hole controls both the number and extension of the paramagnetic domains .",
    "increase of the field at fixed temperaure to enter those domains causes the order parameter to jump from inner to outer localization .",
    "the present approach does not explain the pme seen on the surface superconducting states of 1:4 elongated ellipses @xcite for which the pme in an asymmetric ring  should be studied .",
    "paramagnetic meissner effect in a multiply - connected array of josephson junctions has been reported @xcite for which the diamagnetic current flows on the exterior plaquettes wheras the paramagnetic current flows in the inside of the sample ; this is very similar to that we have described here .",
