    "far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons ( 6 ev@xmath7 ev ) can drastically affect the structure , chemistry , thermal balance , and evolution of portions of the interstellar medium , even if only the mean galactic interstellar radiation field ( isfr ) is present .",
    "for this reason , the simplest chemical models of dense interstellar clouds should include a treatment of the radiative transfer of this radiation through the outer and intermediate layers of material , because the field affects observations that also sample the interior gas .",
    "indeed , most of the molecular gas and certainly all the atomic gas of the galaxy is found in regions where the fuv photon flux is several times that of the mean isrf @xcite .",
    "photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) are special regions of neutral gas exposed to intense fluxes of fuv radiation , which dominate the physical ( heating ) and chemical processes that take place in their interiors .",
    "pdrs can be observed in very different environments , including dense molecular clouds such as the orion bar or the horsehead nebula , planetary nebulae , winds of red giants and agb stars , the interstellar medium of starburst galaxies such as m82 , low metallicity dwarf galaxies , etc .",
    "pdrs are studied through atomic spectral lines such as [ cii ] at 158@xmath8 m , [ oi ] at 63 and 146 @xmath8 m , [ ci ] at 370 and 609 @xmath8 m ; many h@xmath4o lines ; millimetre and sub - millimetre rotational transitions of molecules such as co , @xmath9co , or c@xmath10o ; ro - vibrational and pure rotational lines of h@xmath4 ; and many broad mid - ir features attributed to pahs .",
    "physical conditions of pdrs are thus very diverse",
    ". they can be diffuse , with gas density @xmath11  @xmath1 , or dense , with @xmath12 @xmath1 , while the incident fuv flux may range from the isrf to @xmath13 times the isrf very near to an o star .",
    "an important characteristic of pdrs is that they have a layered structure , as a result of the interaction of the radiation with the gas and dust .",
    "typically , they contain an outer layer of partially ionised gas , where h is atomic and the predominant form of carbon is cii ; a layer of neutral gas , where h@xmath4 is predominant and carbon is present mainly as ci ; and a molecular layer , where co is the main form of carbon .",
    "the ratio between the flux of the incident radiation field and the gas density determines the size of these layers .",
    "the distinct layers should be observable if the pdr is seen edge - on , because then the geometry of the cloud is more apparent .",
    "one of the main difficulties of the study of pdrs is , however , the determination of the geometry of the object .",
    "the gas temperature is also dependent on the strength of the radiation field and the position inside the cloud , and can range from 10 - 100 k in the molecular layer to more than 10@xmath14 k in the surface layers .",

    "newly formed stars produce high intensity photon fields deep inside clouds that lead to the formation of hii regions and , further removed from the exciting stars , pdrs .",
    "the gas - phase chemistry that occurs under these conditions is in most layers greatly different from the chemistry found in quiescent regions .",
    "the abundances of some atoms or molecules are greatly enhanced by the presence of the fuv field , while other species are destroyed by the radiation .",
    "for instance , the abundances of several hydrocarbons ( c@xmath4h , c - c@xmath6h@xmath4 , c@xmath5h , c@xmath53h ) have been found to be almost as high in relatively unshielded regions as in dark clouds @xcite .",
    "however , some of these high abundances are difficult to explain with normal gas - phase chemical models and a link between small hydrocarbons and pahs has been proposed @xcite .    in this paper , we study the chemistry of a dense pdr created after a star has been formed inside a dark cloud .",
    "we are particularly interested in the spatial distributions of hydrocarbons and other complex molecules , and whether or not time - dependent chemistry can explain some of the discrepancies found between the observed abundances and the results of steady - state models @xcite for the horsehead nebula , as well as providing us with some estimate of the age of this pdr .",
    "another use of time - dependent pdr chemistry is described by @xcite .",
    "the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sct_model ] , we describe the time - dependent chemical model used .",
    "our results obtained with our standard model are then considered in section  [ sct_results ] , while in section  [ sct_disc ] we discuss the dependence of our results on assorted physical parameters .",

    "however , the larger differences are only found for small values of the visual extinction , a@xmath65 , which are not the main source of interest of the present paper .",

    ", we use the ` osu.2003 ` @xcite gas - phase chemical network , which contains 419 species and 4103 reactions . this relatively old version of the osu network was used for a variety of reasons .",

    "the differences are discussed in appendix a.    we assume that our dense pdr is formed as a result of the process of star formation inside a dense cloud , when radiation from a new star begins to affect the chemistry of the surrounding gas .",

    "in addition , the co peak occurs at a place tangential to the hydrocarbon peak . @xcite",
    "used steady - state pdr models with the same physical conditions as ours to explain the original observations , with reaction rates from two different networks , umist95 @xcite and osu.2003 @xcite .",
    "they reproduced some of the observed fractional abundances ( c@xmath10o and c@xmath4h ) and some column density ratios , but their calculated peak fractional abundances for c - c@xmath6h@xmath4  and c@xmath5h  are low by an order of magnitude .",
    "the discrepancies were attributed to the return of small carbon molecules to the gas phase through the sputtering of small carbon grains and pahs .",

    "cs and hcs@xmath31  are reproduced within a factor of @xmath297 , which for the first could probably be attributed to the effects of sulfur depletion .",
    "c@xmath6h and c@xmath53h are underproduced in the model , similarly to the other carbon chains , by factors of @xmath297 and @xmath378 , respectively .",
    "the abundances of hco@xmath31  and hnc are almost a factor of 10 below the observed value , although there are values in the model at high a@xmath55 that match the observations .",
    "we find the largest differences for hc@xmath6n , which is heavily underproduced in the standard model at steady state .",
    "if we consider earlier times , we find that for times of 10@xmath379 yr and later , most of the time dependence occurs in inner portions of the pdr , such as the ` cloud ' position of @xcite and even larger values of visual extinction .",
    "for the ` cloud ' position , we find that the abundance profiles of c@xmath4h  may be somewhat better fitted at earlier times . in general , the results of @xcite do not extend far enough into the cloud to be sensitive to time .",
    "there is a large time dependence for the abundance of hc@xmath6n  but this occurs at high values of visual extinction for the most part . since variations in the co initial abundances discussed in sect .",

    "* ) have proposed different elemental abundances to try to explain the abundances in pdrs , we have also changed the relative elemental abundance , mainly by increasing the abundance of c , but also of o , s , and n. an initial carbon abundance twice of that in our standard model shows some of the better agreements for c@xmath5h  ( for the innermost position ) , c@xmath53h , and especially cs and hcs@xmath31 . `",
    "carbon - rich ' abundances similar to the ones used by @xcite overproduce the abundances of most of the carbon - containing molecules .",
    "different sulfur abundances can be used to fine tune the amounts of cs and hcs@xmath31 .",
    "we also explored the effects of different values of the cosmic ray ionization rates .",
    "we used values of 0.5 , 10 , 50 , and 100 times the standard value of @xmath68 .",
    "typically , higher values of the cosmic - ray photodissociation rate ( @xmath380 ) show better agreements for many of the observed molecules , especially combined with a slightly higher density and temperature and/or slightly less intense radiation field .",
    "the time dependence of our models , as is also the case for the time - dependent model of ucl @xcite , can in principle be used to try to set an age for a dense pdr , given a favourable geometry . for the horsehead nebula ,",
    "@xcite argue that , from its size and velocity gradient , the formation time scale could be as short as a few @xmath338 yr , and the object is likely to be destroyed in @xmath58 yr .",
    "these time scales are shorter or comparable to the time needed by our standard model to reach steady - state .",
    "but , in trying to distinguish between steady - state and earlier times by chemical abundance profiles , we must keep in mind some formidable obstacles .",
    "first , the uncertainties in the determination of the pdr geometry and density structure make such an analysis very difficult because they obscure purely temporal effects .",
    "secondly , there is a dependence of early - time results on what is chosen for initial abundances .",
    "thirdly , the abundance profiles of the many hydrocarbons that peak in the outer layers of the cloud show greater sensitivity to time in the inner layers of the pdr because steady - state takes more than 10 times longer to reach in the inner slabs .",
    "unless the pdr is very young , these inner slab abundances are likely to be much smaller than peak values and thus hard to observe .",
    "moreover , most of the more abundant molecules that peak in the deep slabs of the cloud also reach values close to those of steady - state in a relatively short time and may not help much in the determination of age . some molecules , such as hc@xmath6n , suffer large variations in fractional abundance in the same span of time and in the position of the peak abundance , and these could be useful to carry out age estimates . in some of the models we ran ,",
    "we find better agreements for some molecules at times @xmath381 yrs , but given the uncertainties in the observations and in the density structure of the cloud , we need more observations of different positions and molecular transitions to have a clearer view of the structure of the pdr and to be able to make a more precise estimate of its age . in particular , we would need observations of the layers with a@xmath382 , where we find , in our model , the largest variations of abundance for most of the observed molecules .",
    "we present the results of a time - dependent model of a dense photon - dominated region created after a star has formed inside a dark cloud .",
    "we have assumed for our standard model an homogeneous cloud with density @xmath383  @xmath1and gas temperature @xmath2 k , on one side of which impinges an fuv radiation field @xmath3 times the isrf .",
    "we have found that the more unsaturated and/or simpler hydrocarbons , in particular c@xmath4h , c@xmath5h , or c@xmath53h , have peak fractional abundances in the outer layers of the pdr , at a@xmath21212 , at times as early as a few @xmath149 yr , while more saturated hydrocarbons , such as ch@xmath5 , have their peaks deeper into the cloud at these times , around a@xmath277 .",
    "the outer and intermediate layers reach steady - state rapidly , at times shorter than a few @xmath384 yr , while for the inner layers it takes almost an order of magnitude longer .    the molecule cs and the cyanopolyynes also peak nearer to the surface of the cloud , at a@xmath1452 , at times following a few @xmath385 yr , while hcn , hnc , hco@xmath31 , n@xmath4h@xmath31  and nh@xmath6  peak deeper into the clouds , from a@xmath188 onwards .",
    "this result is very interesting because it reproduces in space a similar distribution of molecules to the one found in time for a homogeneous gas - phase model .",
    "the external radiation field seems to keep the chemistry ` young ' in the outer layers of the cloud , while only the more shielded slabs develop a ` late - time ' chemistry .",
    "we have run several models with modifications of some of the parameters of the standard model , varying the intensity of the radiation field , the temperature and density of the cloud , and the initial distribution of fractional abundances in the gas .",
    "for the three models run with non - standard scaling factors of the radiation field of 10 , @xmath155 , and @xmath56 , the effects on the peak fractional abundances of hydrocarbons are not large , typically about an order - of - magnitude . at large values of the radiation field ,",
    "all molecules are swept out of the outer regions , while only the gas at a@xmath386 is completely shielded from variations in the radiation field .",
    "one salient result of increasing the density is that for hydrocarbons that peak in the outer layers , the abundance profile when plotted against distance has a smaller region of large fractional abundance .",
    "another salient feature is that the peak fractional abundances of selected hydrocarbons and cyanopolyynes increase with density in the range 10@xmath387 - 10@xmath388 @xmath1 while other species show little change or even a decrease .",
    "variations in peak fractional abundance as temperature is changed tend to be less significant than with density for temperatures in the range 10 - 200 k. we also explored the effects that different initial fractional abundances have on the results of the model by running a model that starts with atoms in the gas , finding that the evolution of fractional abundances in time is very different from the standard model , although the end result ( steady state ) is , of course , the same .    in a comparison of the results of our standard model with recent high - angular resolution observations of the horsehead nebula",
    ", we were able to reproduce , within the estimated observational uncertainties , the peak fractional abundance and spatial dependence of c@xmath4h ; not so with c@xmath5h and c@xmath6h@xmath4  which show much worse agreements at the outermost positions .",
    "for the rest of the molecules , studied at moderate- and high - angular resolution , the agreement to the observations go from good ( for cs and hcs@xmath31 ) to poor ( especially for hc@xmath6n ) .",
    "we have also used additional models to explore how different physical conditions can improve the agreement with observations .",
    "even if some models did reproduce better some of the molecular abundances , we could not find a single model that was able to fit all the observations at the same time .",
    "we also ran two models in which the initial co abundance was changed from its  standardvalue of @xmath285 with respect to total h. first , we reduced this value to that measured in tmc1-cp @xmath389 , while conserving the total elemental abundances of c and o by increasing the atomic abundances of carbon and oxygen .",
    "secondly , we used the reduced co abundance with no attempt to maintain our standard elemental abundances of c and o. in both instances , little change was seen for carbon - chain species from the standard model at times near steady state . at earlier times , however , the first modification produces strong enhancements in carbon - chain molecules for the inner layers while the second modification produces smaller diminutions of these abundances that are even smaller than at steady state .",
    "the status of the agreement with observations in the horsehead nebula is unaffected by changes in the initial co abundance , since the changes affect the inner layers , which have not been observed .",
    "recently , there have been some new results that might help to solve the disagreement between observation and theory .",
    "first , rimmer and herbst ( in preparation ) have re - calculated the cosmic - ray ionization rate as a function of depth into clouds .",
    "we found in our models that a different value of @xmath68 may dramatically change the abundances of the species .",
    "secondly , there is evidence that calculations including negative ions may indeed increase the calculated abundances of neutral carbon chain species .",
    "these calculations are currently being done by r.  ni chiumin , tom millar , nanase harada , eric herbst and others .",
    "thirdly , @xcite have confirmed that the horsehead nebula is rather clumpy by their analysis of deuterated molecules .",
    "we intend to use these new calculations in further work to find out if they are able to reproduce the abundances of the molecules observed in the horsehead nebula .    from the currently available observational data , it is difficult to obtain a definitive age of the horsehead nebula .",
    "we would need more observations , especially of layers deep into the cloud ( a@xmath382 ) , where the abundances of species such as hydrocarbons and cyanopolyynes are more sensitive to changes in time .",

    "hco@xmath31shows up and down variations of about 20 per cent at steady state .",
