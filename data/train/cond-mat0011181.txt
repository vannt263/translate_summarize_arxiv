    "complexity theory  @xcite , as arising from cook s theorem of 1971  @xcite , deals with the issue of classifying combinatorial optimization problems according to the computational cost required for their solution .",
    "the hard problems are grouped in a class named np , where np stands for ` non - deterministic polynomial time ' .",
    "these problems are such that a potential solution can be checked rapidly whereas finding one solution may require a time growing exponentially with system size in worst case . in turn ,",
    "the hardest problems in np belong to a sub - class called np - complete which is at the root of computational complexity .",
    "the completeness property refers to the fact that if an efficient algorithm for solving just one of these problems could be found , then one would have an efficient algorithm for solving all problems in np . by now , a huge number of np - complete problems have been identified  @xcite , and the lack of an efficient algorithm corroborates the widespread conjecture that no such algorithm exists , or more formally that np@xmath2p where p includes all problems solvable in polynomial time .    complexity theory is based on a worst - case analysis and therefore does not depend on the properties of the particular instances of the problems under consideration . in order to deepen the understanding of typical - case complexity rather than the worst - case one and to improve and test algorithms for real world applications , computer scientists have recently focused their attention on the study of random instances of hard computational problems , seeking for a link between the onset of computational complexity and some intrinsic ( i.e.  algorithm independent ) properties of the model .",
    "analytical and numerical results have accumulated  @xcite showing that the computationally hard instances appear with a significant probability only when generated near `` phase boundaries '' , i.e.  when problems are critically constrained .",
    "this phenomenon is know as the easy - hard transition .",
    "randomized search algorithms provide efficient heuristics for quickly finding solutions provided they exist . at the phase boundary , however , there appears an exponential critical slowing down which makes the search inefficient for any practical purpose .",
    "understanding the behaviour of search processes at the easy - hard transition point constitutes an important theoretical challenge which can be viewed as the problem of building a generalized off - equilibrium theory for stochastic processes which do not satisfy detailed balance .",
    "no static probability measure describing the asymptotic statistical behaviour of the search processes is guaranteed to exist . moreover ,",
    "the hardest random instances of combinatorial optimization problems provide a natural test - bed for the optimization of heuristic search algorithms which are widely used in practice .",
    "how to generate hard and solvable instances is far from obvious and very few examples of such generators are known  @xcite . in most cases , like e.g.  in the random boolean satisfiability problem ( k - sat  @xcite ) , for a short definition see note @xcite , hard instances can be only found in a very narrow region of the parameters space . in this region",
    "the probability that a random instance of the problem has no solution at all is finite . then",
    ", heuristic ( incomplete ) search algorithms have no way to disentangle , in a given finite time , the unsatisfiable instances , from those which are simply very hard to solve .    in this paper",
    ", we shall discuss a very simple and exactly solvable model for the generation of random combinatorial problems .",
    "on one hand , these become extraordinarily hard to solve by local search methods in a large region of the parameter space and yet at least one solution may be superimposed by construction . on the other hand ,",
    "the model may be solved in polynomial time by a simple global method and therefore belongs to the class p.    at variance with respect to the famous random 2-sat problem  @xcite , which is in p and can be solved efficiently by local search methods  @xcite also at the phase boundary , the model we consider undergoes an easy - hard transition very similar ( even harder ) to the one observed in 3-sat as far as local search methods is concerned .",
    "however , the exact mapping of the model on a minimization problem over uniform random hyper - graphs makes the problem analytically tractable .",
    "it is also solvable in polynomial time by a global method which allows for the numerical study of very large systems .",
    "therefore , some of the open questions which arise the the analysis of 3-sat and which are common to the present model can be answered exactly .    in the context of statistical physics",
    "the model provides a simple model for the glass transition , in which the crystalline state can be view as the superimposed solution and the structure of the excited states is responsible for the off - equilibrium behaviour and the associated structural glass transition .",
    "these aspects will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the limit of infinite connectivity provides one of the most studied models in the context of spin glass theory , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "in order to unveil the different aspects of the model , to be referred to as _ hyper - sat _ ( hsat ) , we give explicitly its definition both as a satisfiability problem and as a minimization problem over hyper - graphs .    here",
    "we discuss the hsat model with @xmath3 variables per constraint , which can be viewed as a perfectly balanced version of the famous random 3-sat problem . the case @xmath4 does not present any interesting computational features as far as hardness",
    "is concerned because it can be solved efficiently both by local and global methods .",
    "generalizations to @xmath5 are straightforward .    given a set of @xmath1 boolean variables @xmath6 , we construct an instance of 3-hsat as follows .",
    "firstly we define the following elementary constraints ( 4-clauses sets with 50% satisfying assignments ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the logical and and or operations respectively and the over - bar is the logical negation",
    ". then , by randomly choosing a set @xmath10 of @xmath11 triples @xmath12 among the @xmath1 possible indices and @xmath11 associated unbiased and independent random variables @xmath13 , we construct a boolean expression in conjunctive normal form ( cnf ) as @xmath14 a logical assignment of the @xmath15s satisfying all clauses , that is evaluating @xmath16 to true , is called a solution of the 3-hsat problem .",
    "if no such assignment exists , @xmath16 is said to be unsatisfiable .",
    "a slightly different choice of @xmath17 allows to construct hsat formulas which are random but guaranteed to be satisfiable . to every boolean variable we associate",
    "independently drawn random variables @xmath18 , and define @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",
    "for this choice , cnf formula ( [ fcnf ] ) is satisfied by @xmath21 .",
    "as we shall discuss in great detail , these formulas provide a uniform ensemble of hard satisfiable instances for local search methods .",
    "we refer to this version of the model as the _",
    "satisfiable hsat_. indeed , the random signs of @xmath17 can be removed in this satisfiable case by negating all boolean variables @xmath22 associated to negative @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting model has @xmath24 for all @xmath20 , and the forced satisfying solution is @xmath25 .",
    "the use of the @xmath26 is a way of hiding the latter solution by a _ random gauge transformation _ without changing the properties of the model .",
    "the impossibility of inverting efficiently the gauge transformation by local methods is a consequence of the branching process arising form the presence of @xmath3 variables in each constraint . for any @xmath5",
    "the same result would hold whereas for @xmath4 the problem trivializes .",
    "the hsat model can be easily described as a minimization problem of a cost - energy function over a random hyper - graph . given a random hyper - graph @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the set of @xmath1 vertices and @xmath10 is the set of @xmath11 hyper - edges joining triples of vertices , the energy function to be minimized reads @xmath29 = m-\\sum_{\\{i , j , k\\}\\in e } j_{ijk } \\",
    ", s_i s_j s_k \\;\\ ; , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where each vertex @xmath30 bears a binary `` spin '' variable @xmath31 , and the weights @xmath17 associated to the random bonds can be either @xmath32 at random , in the so called _ frustrated _ case , or simply equal to @xmath33 in the _ unfrustrated _ model .",
    "once the mapping @xmath34 if @xmath35 and @xmath36 if @xmath37 is established , one can easily notice that the energy function in eq.([ham ] ) simply counts twice the number of violated clauses in the previously defined cnf formulas with the same set of @xmath38 s .",
    "the frustrated and the unfrustrated cases correspond to the hsat and to the satisfiable hsat formulas respectively .    the computational issue consists in finding a configuration of spin variables which minimizes @xmath39 .",
    "if all the terms @xmath40 appearing in the energy are simultaneously maximized ( `` satisfied '' ) the energy vanishes .",
    "this is always possible in the unfrustrated case just by setting @xmath34 , @xmath41 . in the frustrated case ,",
    "there exist a critical value of the average connectivity above which the various terms start to be in conflict , that is frustration becomes effective in the model . in random hyper - graphs",
    "the control parameter is the average density of bonds , @xmath42 ( or , for the cnf formula , the density of clauses @xmath43 ) . for sufficiently small densities ,",
    "the graph consists of many small connected clusters of size up to @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 increases up to the percolation value @xmath46 , there appears a giant cluster containing a finite fraction of the @xmath1 sites in the limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "however , also this cluster can a priori have a tree - like structure , for which the randomness of the couplings @xmath13 can be eliminated by a proper gauge transformation , @xmath47 , of the spin variables .",
    "as we shall see , there exist two other thresholds of the bond density at which more complicated and interesting dynamical and structural changes take place .    in spite of apparent similarities , hsat and the random boolean satisfiability problem ( k - sat  @xcite )",
    "differ in some basic aspects .    in k",
    "- sat the fluctuations of the frequencies of appearance of the variables in the clauses lead to both single and two body interactions in the associated energy function  @xcite which force the minima in some specific random directions and which rule out the existence of a purely dynamical threshold ( see below ) .",
    "algorithms may take advantage of such information and both heuristic as well as complete algorithms show a performance which indeed depends on the criterion used to fix the variables .",
    "for example , rigorous lower bounds to the critical threshold have been improved recently by exploiting this opportunity in a simple tractable way  @xcite . on the same footing ,",
    "the efficiency of the most popular heuristic and complete search algorithms , namely walk - sat  @xcite and tableau  @xcite , is again based on strategies which exploit the above structure .",
    "note that the above improvements can not be applied to the hsat model where formulas are completely balanced .",
    "moreover , in k - sat the mapping of the problem over directed random graphs is rather involved and the exact analytical solution is still lacking , while in hsat the connection to random hyper - graphs is clear and makes the analysis tractable .    finally ,",
    "restriction of k - sat to satisfiable instances ( for instance by selecting at random clauses which are satisfied by a previously fixed assignment of variables ) does not provide a uniform ensemble of hard satisfiable problems even when restricted to local search methods  @xcite .",
    "given the mapping over random hyper - graphs , the satisfiability problem for hsat can be solved in @xmath48 steps by simply noticing that the problem of satisfying all constrains is nothing but the problem of solving an associated linear system modulo 2 , i.e.  in @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "upon introducing the two sets of binary variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the hsat decision problem becomes simply the problem of determining the existence of a solution in @xmath49 $ ] to the random linear system @xmath54 , with @xmath55 running over all triples .",
    "finally , we notice that in the high @xmath45 unsat ( or frustrated ) region the optimization problem of minimizing the number of violated constrains , the so called max - hsat , is indeed computationally very hard both for complete and incomplete algorithms and no global method for finding ground states is available .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we anticipate here the main results leaving for the following sections a thorough discussion of the analytical and numerical studies .",
    "the frustrated hsat model presents two clear transitions .",
    "the first one appears at @xmath56 and it is of purely dynamical nature .",
    "there the typical formula still remains satisfiable with probability one , but an exponential number of local energy minima appear at positive energies .",
    "deterministic algorithms , like greedy search or zero temperature dynamics , try to decrease the energy in every step and thus get stuck at least at this threshold .",
    "randomized algorithms may escape from these minima , but they undergo a slowing down from an exponentially fast convergence to a polynomially slow one , i.e.  at @xmath57 the typical time for finding a solution diverges as a power of the number of variables .",
    "the dynamical transition at @xmath57 seems to be accompanied by a dynamical glassy transition due to replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) effects connected with the appearance of an exponential number of local minima .",
    "an approximate variational calculation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on the method ) involving rsb gives @xmath58 which is in good agreement with the value of @xmath57 where local minima appear .",
    "the second transition appears at @xmath59 and corresponds to the so - called sat / unsat transition ( below @xmath60 the typical problem is satisfiable whereas above @xmath60 it becomes unsatisfiable ) . at this point",
    "the structure of the global energy minima changes abruptly .",
    "the ground states have strictly positive energy , thus no satisfying assignments for the hsat formula exist any more . while the number of these configurations is always exponentially large ( the ground state entropy is always finite ) , at @xmath60 a finite fraction of the variables , the so - called _ backbone _ component , becomes totally constraint , i.e.  the backbone variables take the same value in all minima  @xcite .",
    "an important difference of the sat / unsat transition in hsat compared to k - sat  @xcite is the non - existence of any precursor . for @xmath61 and large @xmath1 , all variables",
    "@xmath62 take equally often the values + 1 and @xmath63 in the ground states ( they have zero local magnetization ) , even those which become backbone elements when @xmath60 is reached by adding new 4-clauses sets .",
    "the lack of any precursor comes from the non - existence of single- or two - body interactions in eq.([ham ] ) .",
    "the unfrustrated or satisfiable hsat problem has by construction at least one solution which we find to be superimposed without affecting the statistical features of the model for @xmath61 in the limit of large @xmath1 , including the dynamical transition at @xmath64 .",
    "it is impossible to get any information on the superimposed solution by looking at the full solution space , because it is completely hidden by the exponential number of ground states . randomly chosen satisfying assignments do not show any correlation . at exactly the same @xmath59 as in the frustrated model",
    ", there appears a transition from a sat phase with exponentially many unbiased solutions to another sat phase where the solutions are strongly concentrated around the superimposed solution . the latter one is now hidden by the presence of exponentially many local energy minima with positive cost .",
    "these minima have exactly the statistical properties of the global minima of the corresponding frustrated hsat problem , that is the hsat problem defined over the same hyper - graph but with randomized signs of the couplings @xmath17 . more specifically , the energy , the entropy and the backbone component size coincide . due to their finite entropy",
    ", an algorithm will thus hit many of these local minima before it reaches the satisfying ground state .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , finding this solution by backtracking , e.g.  with the davis - putnam ( dp ) procedure  @xcite , is nevertheless easier than proving the unsatisfiability of hsat ( or identifying ground states in the frustrated version ) .",
    "this results stems from the missing information on the true ground state energy of hsat above @xmath60 .",
    "the solution time is however found to be clearly exponential in both cases . in the @xmath65 region , the model provides a uniform ensemble of hard sat instances for local methods which can be used to test and optimize algorithms .",
    "in our analytical approach , we exploit the well known analogies between combinatorial optimization problems and statistical mechanics . in both cases ,",
    "the system is characterized by some cost - energy function , as it is given e.g.  by eq.([ham ] ) for hsat . in equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , any configuration @xmath66 is realized with probability @xmath67 \\}/z$ ] where @xmath68 is the inverse temperature and @xmath69 the partition function .",
    "if the temperature is lowered , the probability becomes more and more concentrated on the global energy minima and finally , for @xmath70 , only the ground states keep non - zero weights .    in order to compute the average free energy , we resort to the replica symmetric ( rs ) functional replica method developed for diluted spin glasses which is known to provide exact results for ferromagnetic models : to circumvent the difficulty of computing the average value of @xmath71",
    ", we compute the @xmath72 moment of @xmath69 for integer - valued @xmath73 and perform an analytical continuation to real @xmath73 to exploit the identity @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath72 moment of @xmath69 is obtained by replicating @xmath73 times the sum over the spin configuration and averaging over the disorder  @xcite @xmath75 \\right ) \\gg \\quad , \\label{nthmoment}\\ ] ] which in turn may be viewed as a generating function in the variable @xmath76 .    in order to compute the expectation values that appear in eq.([nthmoment ] ) , one notices that each single term @xmath77 ) $ ] factorises over the sets of different triples of indices due to the absence of any correlation in the probability distribution of the @xmath17 .",
    "it follows @xmath78 the averaged term in eq.([nthmoment2 ] ) depends on the @xmath79 spins only through the @xmath80 occupation fractions @xmath81 labelled by the vectors @xmath82 with @xmath73 binary components ; @xmath83 equals the number of labels @xmath30 such that @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the final expression of the @xmath72 moment of @xmath69 to the leading order in @xmath1 ( i.e.  by resorting to a saddle point integration ) , can be written as @xmath86 ) $ ] where @xmath87 $ ] is the maximum over all possible @xmath88 s of the functional  @xcite @xmath89 = -\\gamma ( 1+\\beta n)-\\sum_{\\vec \\sigma } c(\\vec \\sigma )   \\ln c(\\vec \\sigma)+\\gamma \\sum_{\\vec \\sigma,\\vec \\rho,\\vec \\tau }   c(\\vec \\sigma ) c(\\vec \\rho ) c(\\vec \\tau ) \\exp(\\beta \\sum_a \\sigma^a   \\rho^a \\tau^a ) \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; . \\label{free}\\ ] ] the saddle point equation @xmath90 reads @xmath91 where the lagrange multiplier @xmath92 enforces the normalization constraint @xmath93 , and goes to @xmath94 for @xmath95 . in eq.([free ] ) , one may easily identify two terms , one model dependent and the other ( @xmath96 ) simply describing the degeneracy ( the so called combinatorial _ entropy _ ) with which each term of the generating function appears given the representation in terms of the occupation fractions . in the limit of interest @xmath97 and in the replica symmetric subspace ,",
    "the freezing of the spin variables is properly described by a rescaling of the local magnetizations of the form @xmath98 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath99 is therefore introduced through the generating functional @xmath100 where @xmath101 is nothing but an effective field in which the spins are immersed .",
    "@xmath102 depends on @xmath103 only via @xmath104 . in this representation ,",

    "the associated saddle - point equation reads @xmath107 where @xmath108    in the case of _ satisfiable hsat _",
    ", at @xmath109 ( @xmath70 ) and in the version having no random gauge ( @xmath110 ) , the spins turn out to be subject to an effective local field @xmath101 which fluctuates from site to site according to the following simple probability distribution @xmath111 with the saddle - point conditions @xmath112 the above structure is not surprising for a ferromagnetic model since @xmath113 is nothing but the fraction of sites which have non - vanishing field and are therefore totally magnetized .",
    "the saddle - point equations simplify once rewritten in terms the probability distribution @xmath114 of the local magnetizations @xmath115 which takes the particularly simple form @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the kronecker - symbol .",
    "thus , a fraction @xmath113 of all logical variables is _ frozen _ to + 1 in all ground states , whereas the others take both truth values with same frequency . the self - consistent equation for @xmath118 in eq.([eq : psaddle ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath119 and can be justified by simple probabilistic arguments : a variable is frozen if and only if it is contained in at least one hyper - edge @xmath20 where also the two neighbors are frozen .",
    "thus a variable is unfrozen , @xmath120 , if and only if every adjacent hyper - edge contains at least one more unfrozen variable . for a spin of connectivity @xmath102",
    ", this happens according to eq.([eq : op ] ) with probability @xmath121 .",
    "the average over the poisson - distribution @xmath122 of connectivities @xmath102 results in the total probability for a variable to be unfrozen , so eq.([eq : saddle ] ) follows . as an additional result of replica theory",

    "no internal structure is found in the set of satisfying assignments and , choosing randomly two of them , they have hamming distance @xmath125 . to leading order in @xmath1 , the @xmath11 4-clauses sets act independently , each dividing the number of satisfying assignments by two , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath126 .",
    "this is a clear sign that the structure of the hyper - graph is still tree - like",
    ".    at @xmath127 , a new solution of eq.([eq : saddle ] ) appears discontinuously , having a fraction @xmath128 of completely magnetized variables .",
    "this transition can be seen as a percolation transition of fully magnetized triples of connected variables .",
    "the entropy of this solution remains however smaller than the entropy @xmath129 of the paramagnetic solution , thus the total solution space is still correctly described by @xmath120 for all @xmath130 .",
    "the appearance of the new solution signals however a structural change in the set of solutions which breaks into an exponential number of clusters .",
    "the cluster containing the imposed solution @xmath131 is described by the new meta - stable solution .",
    "another important difference to the low-@xmath45 phase is an exponential number of local minima of the energy function ( [ ham ] ) showing up at @xmath57 .",
    "these have positive energies , and the corresponding logical assignments do not satisfy the hsat formula .",
    "algorithms which decrease the energy in every time step by local variable changes , like e.g.  zero - temperature glauber dynamics or greedy algorithms , get almost surely trapped in these states and do not find a zero - energy ground state for @xmath132 .",
    "randomized algorithms may escape from these minima , but as found numerically , this causes a polynomial slowing down .    by increasing @xmath45 above @xmath57 ,",
    "the number of ground - state clusters decreases further . at @xmath133",
    "all but one ground - state clusters disappear , and the non - trivial solution of ( [ eq : saddle ] ) becomes the stable one .",
    "so only the cluster including the imposed solution survives , it still contains @xmath134 solutions , but 88.3% of all variables are fixed to @xmath135 , thus forming the _ backbone _ which appears discontinuously . as is known from ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of an extensive backbone is closely related to the exponential computational hardness of a problem .",
    "the remaining 11.7% of un - frozen variables change their values from ground - state to ground - state .",
    "they are contained in small disconnected components or dangling ends of the hyper - graph .",
    "the behavior of frustrated hsat is similar , as given both by numerical analysis and by rs or variational rsb calculations .",
    "we find that the solution @xmath136 ( and its corresponding cluster ) in satisfiable hsat are just superimposed to the solution structure of random hsat .",
    "thus , the statistical properties of the solutions do not change for @xmath61 , including also the clustering of solutions above @xmath57 . at @xmath133",
    "the model undergoes a sat / unsat transition , and the solution entropy jumps from 0.082 down to minus infinity .",
    "the variational rsb calculation gives a value for the dynamical critical connectivity @xmath137 which is close to the exact value @xmath138 .",
    "this result gives evidence for the validity of the variational approach in the region where local minima first appear , i.e.  where the result does not depend strongly on the specific functional ansatz made for the rsb probability distributions .",
    "for the sat / unsat static transition the predictions of the variational rsb analysis can be strongly affected by the restriction of the functional space which does not necessarily match the geometrical structure ( clustering ) of the space of solution . however , in the case of hsat the results are still in good agreement , we find @xmath139 .",
    "in the hsat model , we are able to extract exact results  without the need of rsb  by identifying the topological structures in the underlying hyper - graph which are responsible of the sat / unsat transition ( or of frustration and glassiness ) .",
    "the presence ( or the absence ) of such topological structures in the hyper - graph drastically changes the statistical mechanical properties of the model .",
    "the different phase transitions can be viewed as different kinds of percolation in the random graph theory language  @xcite .",
    "we have already seen that the formation of a locally stable ferromagnetic state in unfrustrated hsat at @xmath127 can be understood in term of percolation arguments .",
    "the same arguments reveal that at @xmath57 many metastables states appear in both versions of the model , giving rise to a dynamical transition .    in order to understand what happens at the critical point @xmath60 we need to introduce the notion of _ hyper - loops _ , that is the most natural generalization of the usual _ loop _ to hyper - graphs whith multi - vertex links . given a random graph @xmath140 , where @xmath28 is the set of vertices and @xmath10 is the set of ( hyper-)links",
    ", a hyper - loop can be defined as a non - zero set of ( hyper-)links , @xmath141 , such that the degree of the subgraph @xmath142 is even , i.e.  every vertex belongs to an even number of ( hyper-)links ( including zero ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ( left ) we show the smallest hyper - loop in a @xmath3 random hyper - graph .",
    "note that in random hyper - graph typical hyper - loops are very large and the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ( left ) is extremely rare for n large .",
    "= 0.6    in a similar way we can identify those vertices which are totally constrained . a set of ( hyper-)links",
    ", @xmath143 , constrains completely the spin at site @xmath30 if in the sub - graph @xmath144 the vertex @xmath30 has an odd degree and the remaining vertices an even one . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ( right ) we show the smallest of such structures .    in a zero - energy configuration",
    "( sat assignment ) we have @xmath145 .",
    "then , given any hyper - loop @xmath146 , we conclude @xmath147 where the second equality comes from the fact that in the second product every spin appears an even number of times .    in frustrated hsat the couplings",
    "are randomly fixed to @xmath32 and , consequently , the first product in eq.([hl ] ) is equal to -1 with probability @xmath148",
    ". then we can conclude that as soon as one hyper - loop arises in the hyper - graph half the formulas become unsatisfiable .",
    "in general , given a hyper - graph with @xmath149 hyper - loops , the fraction of sat formulas ( with that given hyper - graph ) is @xmath150 .",
    "still one needs to average this fraction over the random hyper - graph in order to obtain the right fraction of sat formulas .",
    "we have numerically found that at the critical value @xmath133 the percolation of hyper - loops takes place , that is , in the large @xmath1 limit , the average number of hyper - loops @xmath151 is zero for @xmath61 and @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "this is the direct explanation of the sat / unsat transition in terms of hyper - graph topology .    in the unfrustrated model @xmath154 and eq.([hl ] ) is always satisfied .",
    "however , the mean number of hyper - loops @xmath151 is related to the entropy of satisfying assignments through @xmath155 .",
