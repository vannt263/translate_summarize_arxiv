    "the understanding and prevention of oxidation processes underpins many successful technologies such as the galvanization of metals , steel manufacturing , and the controlled oxidation of silicon wafers , to mention a few examples .",
    "furthermore , the exposure to ambient illumination is behind the oxidation and subsequent degradation ( also known as _ weathering _ ) of commercial polymers .",
    "two - dimensional atomic materials@xcite like graphene,@xcite hexagonal boron nitride,@xcite and transition - metal dichalcogenides@xcite are chemically stable when exposed to light under standard ambient conditions . on the other hand , black phosphorus ( bp)@xcite has a remarkable puckered structure that anticipates its unique chemical properties@xcite .",
    "uncapped bp transistors exposed to light and to ambient conditions break down after a few hours even though the stack contains a large number of monolayers , thus implying a complete material degradation that originates from random locations at the exposed layer . capping by an alo@xmath1 overlayer@xcite or by hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn)@xcite helps to prevent this acute degradation process .",
    "understanding the oxidation of bp is a pressing and relevant problem with deep consequences for the science and engineering of this layered material and we establish that , among other mechanisms , intrinsic defects can initiate the light - induced degradation of bp : one must lower the reactivity of structural defects to delay its photo - oxidation .",
    "a non - constant height profile is apparent in bp even prior to degradation,@xcite implying the existence of intrinsic structural defects@xcite and a non - zero local curvature through the surface .",
    "the degradation of uncapped samples leads to a visible increase of these height variations , and hence to an increased local curvature @xcite that manifests as pits , bubbles , and bulges .",
    "the properties of membrane - like materials can be tuned by changes in their local shape@xcite , and it will be shown that the propensity of bp to degrade is ultimately linked to its local geometry .",
    "chemisorption barriers for oxygen dimers ( o@xmath2 ) on ideal bp are larger than ten electron - volts ( two - hundred and fifty kcal / mol , or a thousand kj / mol ) and can not be accessed through optical excitations in the visible spectrum ( 390 to 780 nm , or 1.6 to 3.2 ev ) .",
    "we realize , nevertheless , that these barriers are largely reduced at intrinsic defects and take on typical values for photoinduced chemical reactions .",
    "indeed , photoexcitations within 3.7 to 5.0 ev lead to the photochemistry of adenine and aminopurine,@xcite setting an energy scale for reactions that could be activated by light .",
    "light introduces sufficient energy to break or reorganize most covalent bonds and enables reactions that are otherwise thermodynamically forbidden , given that activation barriers of the order of a few ev ( @xmath310,000 kelvin ) are overcome .",
    "this article represents a departure from other theoretical works@xcite that study the degradation of bp as we focus on the role played by intrinsic defects on this material s chemistry .",
    "this mechanistic study begins with a structural and electronic ground state consisting of a planar or conical bp monolayer and non - interacting o@xmath2 molecules .",
    "we create excited atomistic ( hence electronic ) structures by bringing o@xmath2 molecules through the bp monolayer to gain insight into the energetics involved .",
    "we then pursue new equilibrium oxidized structures with _ ab initio _",
    "atomistic optimizations in which the o@xmath2 molecules have been chemisorbed onto the bp monolayer , and provide a thorough geometrical and electronic characterization of these systems towards the end of the manuscript .",
    "although our present focus is on the oxidation by o@xmath2 for a self - contained discussion , similar studies can be performed to understand the degradation of bp from water molecules and other ambient contaminants .",
    "an important component of this study is a tool to analyze the shape of two - dimensional materials that we have developed @xcite .",
    "we first investigate how much energy is needed for o@xmath2 to pierce through a bp monolayer .",
    "two finite ( aperiodic ) structures are considered for this purpose : a planar one containing about 600 atoms , and a conical one containing about 500 atoms@xcite ( see methods ) .    the local atomistic geometry is established from five local quantities that indicate how the material elongates / compresses ( the trace and determinant of the metric tr(g ) and det(g ) , where g is the metric tensor ) and/or curves ( through the mean curvature @xmath4 , and the gaussian curvature @xmath5 ) along two orthogonal directions@xcite , and how the local thickness @xmath6 changes with respect to its value @xmath7 for an ideal crystalline bp monolayer .",
    "bp is a buckled material , and @xmath7 is the distance among the two sublayers @xmath8 and @xmath9 that make up a monolayer .",
    "extensive details of the discrete geometry employed to characterize the shape of bp are given in the methods section @xcite .",
    "for o@xmath2 to oxidize bp depends on the local shape , and the smallest barriers on ( a ) planar or ( b ) conical structures occur at intrinsic defects .",
    "atomistic structures and the local geometry at one sublayer ( @xmath8 ) are shown as insets .",
    "the darker / lighter color seen on tr(g ) and det(g ) implies larger / smaller interatomic distances at these defects .",
    "the low activation barriers facilitated by intrinsic defects are within the visible electromagnetic spectrum , which is highlighted by the yellow rectangles within the 1.63.2 ev energy range.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    activation barriers @xmath10 for the oxidation of bp that take full consideration of the spin - polarization of the oxygen dimers are estimated by bringing a vertically - oriented o@xmath2 molecule with its center of mass located at a height @xmath11 along the local normal into proximity of the bp structure , and crossing bp at the largest possible distance among o and p atoms ( see reds dots on the structural insets on figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "these activation barriers are computed with _",
    "ab initio _ calculations without performing any structural optimization ( see methods ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : fig1]a , an oxygen dimer requires about 12 ev to rest at the middle of an ideal bp monolayer that has the uniform geometry shown in the upper inset ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) in figure [ fig : fig1]a .",
    "the energy barrier is symmetric around @xmath17 , where the dimer s center of mass coincides with the center of mass of the two buckled bp sublayers.@xcite such a high energy barrier makes the chemisorption of o@xmath2 onto ideal bp rather unlikely .",
    "however , the maximum magnitude of @xmath18 decreases significantly within intrinsic defects : for instance , the line defect with burgers vector ( 0,1 ) @xcite induces a dislocation line containing pentagon / heptagon pairs .",
    "@xcite the energy range for visible light is within 1.6 and 3.2 ev , corresponding to wavelengths within 390 to 780 nm ( yellow rectangles in figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the maximum value taken by @xmath18 as an o@xmath2 molecule pierces bp through the geometrical center of the heptagon ( red dot shown in the leftmost inset , figure [ fig : fig1]a ) is slightly smaller than 6.0 ev and accessible via light - induced excitations in the near ultraviolet range . in computing these energy barriers with spin - polarized calculations in which the total spin is left unrestricted , the spin of o@xmath2 transitions from a triplet state at @xmath19 2  of the center of mass of the bp monolayer , to a singlet state for @xmath20 2  .",
    "this change of spin configuration of the optimal structures is in agreement with previous reports @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the energy barrier at this intrinsic defect is naturally related to the larger metric invariants ( tr(g ) and det(g ) seen in the inset of figure 1a ) that lower the electronic repulsion significantly .",
    "crucially , this is only one of many possible structural defects on bp , as this two - dimensional material is known to be polymorphic.@xcite    the effect of curvature on @xmath18 is studied in a conical structure that contains about 500 atoms and acquires its largest curvature and compressive strain at its apex , as indicated by the white tones on tr(g ) and det(g ) and the large values of @xmath4 and @xmath5.@xcite a dimer piercing the apex ( upper - left inset on figure [ fig : fig1]b ) encounters a maximum value of @xmath18 close to 18 ev , a value further away from the reach of optically - induced chemistry . the increase of the barrier arises from the structural compression that accompanies the creation of curvature at the apex.@xcite one can tell `` up '' from `` down '' on a conical structure , and this distinction makes @xmath10 asymmetric ( solid , asymmetric black line on figure [ fig : fig1]b ) .    the conical structure employed in figure [ fig : fig1]b has a dislocation / disclination axis.@xcite the characteristic structural reconstruction at the edges of bp@xcite is a manifestation of the polymorphism of this material,@xcite and we found a metastable local structure along the disclination line of the conical structure with two atoms pulled away from a common bond during the structural optimization .",
    "we envision that similar defects may originate on bp during growth .",
    "this metastable structure does not localize electronic states within the semiconducting gap either,@xcite a fact that will later be discussed in greater detail .",
    "the barrier @xmath18 is very low at this defect , largely overlapping with the energy of photons in the visible range , as depicted by the yellow rectangle on figure [ fig : fig1]b .",
    "an oxygen dimer attaching to bp at this intrinsic defect requires an activation energy smaller than 4.0 ev , which is available through an electronic photo - excitation induced by violet light .",
    "the accessible energy barrier for photo - oxidation at this second defect provides conclusive validation of the hypothesis that the photo - oxidation and degradation of bp originates at intrinsic defects .       at intrinsic defects",
    "the first frames to the left show the initial vertical placement of o@xmath2 within the intrinsic defects .",
    "oxygen dissociation at these intrinsic defects occurs at the frames highlighted in yellow .",
    "frames at the far right show the optimized structures , at which distances among o atoms are 2.96 and 3.08  for at structure ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . for reference ,",
    "the equilibrium distance among o atoms in o@xmath2 is 1.25  .",
    "full movies of the dissociation process are available as supporting information.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    once an o@xmath2 molecule is placed within an intrinsic defect aided by a suitable optical excitation , it will initially be expelled from bp with a force that has a normal component proportional to the slope of the curves in figure [ fig : fig1 ] : @xmath21 , and forces felt by individual oxygen atoms lead to the dissociation of o@xmath2 near bp at intrinsic defects .",
    "we demonstrate this dissociation mechanism next .",
    "we registered the atomistic dynamics of o@xmath2 placed initially at rest into the two intrinsic defects displaying the smallest energy barriers in figure [ fig : fig1 ] and assuming that the atomistic reconfiguration is adiabatic .",
    "( under non - adiabatic conditions , the dimer may collect sufficient kinetic energy to cross onto a subsequent monolayer . ) full movies showing this process ( movies s1 and s2 ) can be found as supporting information .",
    "the fundamental finding is that the distance among o atoms increases from 1.25 up to 2.96  at the end of the structural optimization in figure 2a , and up to 3.08  at the end of the optimization depicted in figure 2b : o@xmath2 dissociates at intrinsic defects .",
    "additional details follow .    as indicated previously ,",
    "the dimer was placed vertically at the onset of the optimization , but it is expelled from the defect as the o atoms end up dissociated and lining up horizontally .",
    "distances from o atoms to the closest p atoms are equal to 1.53  and the p - p - o angles subtended to the three closest p atoms are equal to 111@xmath22 , 116@xmath22 , and 124@xmath22 .",
    "the oxidation mediated by the second intrinsic defect provides further evidence for the fact that defects help dissociate o@xmath2 due to a non - symmetric force that pulls o atoms apart .",
    "the first dissociated o atom in figure [ fig : figreel]b binds to a single p atom with a bond distance of 1.56  , quite similar to the distance seen for the o - p single bonds in figure [ fig : figreel]a .",
    "the second o atom binds to two p atoms with distances of 1.73  .",
    "we address the energetics as bp oxidizes next .",
    "we now study the successive oxidation of two dimers at nearby structural defects .",
    "the two dimers are placed far above bp prior to oxidation in order to set a suitable reference energy .",
    "as the first dimer is placed into the pentagon defect in figure [ fig : figenergetics]a , it binds to bp and the system gains 4.3 ev .",
    "the system is allowed to relieve forces ( see methods ) and it releases an energy of about 7 ev in the process , making for a highly exothermic reaction.@xcite such a large energy release could unleash a continued oxidation process even in the absence of external illumination if not promptly dissipated .",
    ".,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    continuing the discussion of figure [ fig : figenergetics]a , a second dimer is placed into bp at a second heptagonal defect , gaining 3.1 ev as it binds to bp .",
    "it is energetically unfavorable for oxygen dimer to oxidize consecutive heptagonal defects on this dislocation line , as the relaxed structure containing two dimers has an energy larger than the structure in which the second dimer is yet to be absorbed .",
    "oxygens on this second dimer did not dissociate , but the distance between the two p atoms increases from 2.3  to 3.2  as a common p - p bond is broken ; these two p atoms bind to a single o atom with bond distances of 1.87  and a p - o - p angle of 117@xmath22 .",
    "oxygens on the second dimer remain bounded at a larger separation of 1.48  .",
    "there are no significant rearrangements of the first two o atoms upon absorption of the second dimer .",
    "the process is repeated for two o@xmath2 molecules that oxidize the structural defect that was shown in figures [ fig : fig1]b and [ fig : figreel]b .",
    "as seen on figure [ fig : figenergetics]b , the energy cost upon absorption of the first dimer is 3.5 ev , which could be accessible if the system adsorbs light with a wavelength of 354 nm .",
    "an energy release of 7.0 ev is recorded again as the structural forces are relieved .",
    "the second dimer seen in figure [ fig : figenergetics]b is unable to dissociate and has a distance of 1.49  among o atoms , and of 1.80  among o - p bonds .",
    "the structure gains 6.8 ev when the second dimer is absorbed , which may be enabled by an optical excitation in the ultraviolet range , and releases about 7.0 ev through the atomistic optimization process to make for a slightly exothermic reaction ( see methods ) .",
    "the results from figure 3 indicate that larger energy gains can be attained when the second dimer is not in close proximity to the first absorbed o@xmath2 molecule .",
    "the substantial energy gains upon chemisorption recorded in figure [ fig : figenergetics ] imply that the oxidized structures are more stable than bp containing intrinsic defects , providing a clear picture of how reactive the material can be at these defects .",
    "even though the defects studied in figure [ fig : figenergetics]a and [ fig : figenergetics]b are quite different , they exhibit a similar trend in the oxidation barriers and in the energy release upon oxidation , an encouraging finding that enables a general understanding of the oxidation of bp in terms of energy barriers alone , regardless of the specific atomistic arrangements found at individual intrinsic defects .",
    "we conclude this work with an analysis of the global shape and the electronic properties of the oxidized structures that is provided in figures [ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] . a line defect@xcite does not produce significant curvature on bp ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 in figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) , but it creates a periodic compression / elongation of interatomic distances that is captured by the white / black tones seen on tr(g ) and det(g ) in figure [ fig : fig4].@xcite the squares on the individual _ local shape _ subplots on this figure have sides that are 50  long and provide a global view of the shape of the finite systems we work with .",
    "the chemisorption of a single oxygen dimer does not change the shape of this planar structure@xcite significantly ; as indicated in previous paragraphs , bp accommodated the dimer by bringing it out of the planar structure and thus maintaining its original shape without any significant alteration ( see _ local shape _ subplots in figure [ fig : fig4]a ) .",
    "the oxygen atoms receive a large amount of electronic charge from phosphorus atoms ( see _ charge transfer _ subplot in figure [ fig : fig4]a ) .",
    "additionally , the hydrogen atoms that passivate the edges of the final structure receive electronic charge from phosphorus .",
    "however , a similar charge transfer from hydrogen atoms is seen throughout all systems studied , and for that reason these plots are omitted from now on .    a , [ fig : figreel]a and [ fig : figenergetics]a .",
    "bp has a periodically buckled structure , and the geometry is displayed at sublayers @xmath8 and @xmath9 along with the local thickness @xmath25 .",
    "oxygen dimers ( and hydrogen atoms at the finite boundaries of the bp monolayer ) gain electrons from bp and the electronic gap is reduced as the second dimer is absorbed .",
    "simulated stm images are shown too.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the next question is whether localized states that decrease the magnitude of the electronic gap are created at early stages of oxidation .",
    "this question is answered by determining the first electronic wavefunctions below and above the fermi energy ( @xmath26 ) having a non - zero density at a given individual atom .",
    "a single chemisorbed o@xmath2 does not decrease the magnitude of the electronic gap ( see _ electronic gap _",
    "subplot ) , which remains close to about 1.1 ev in figure [ fig : fig4]a due to finite - size effects@xcite .",
    "many two - dimensional materials localize electronic states at intrinsic defects .",
    "in fact , it is the presence of these localized electronic states what permits the facile identification of structural defects.@xcite but many structural reconstructions of bp @xcite lack localized electronic states , making the identification of defects under tem and optical probes a more difficult task .",
    "the simulated stm images provided at the far right of figure [ fig : fig4]a are three - dimensional isosurface images produced from the density of electronic states having energies up to + 1 ( down to @xmath271 ) ev from @xmath26.@xcite the dislocation line is apparent on the stm at + 1 ev . the patterns seen on the stm image at energies below @xmath26 are also seen on the _ electronic gap _ subplot .",
    "all remaining figures in this manuscript were arranged following a layout identical to that of figure [ fig : fig4]a .",
    "the electronic properties of the planar bp sample after the chemisorption of a second dimer are shown in figure [ fig : fig4]b . the increase in distances among p atoms",
    "once the second dimer was absorbed is captured by a new visible dark pattern on the metric invariants in the upper sublayer @xmath9 on figure [ fig : fig4]b where the second dimer was absorbed .",
    "curvatures ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 on figure [ fig : fig4]b ) continue to be negligible and the ratio @xmath25 remains close to unity , indicating no significant bulging either .",
    "importantly , the overall shape observed in figure [ fig : fig4 ] tells us that the absorption of oxygen does not induce a significant curvature at the onset of the oxidation process .",
    "oxygen atoms continue to gain electronic charge as the second dimer is added . a significant difference , though , concerns the magnitude of the gap that is reduced this time , as highlighted by the red undertones in the _ electronic gap _ subplot in figure [ fig : fig4]b .",
    "this localized charge is also evident on the simulated iso - surface plots .",
    "oxygen atoms gain electrons from bp , and the electronic gap is reduced as these two dimers are absorbed .",
    "simulated stm images are also shown.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    if the structure has some curvature originally , the oxidation process tends to increase it . to demonstrate this statement",
    ", the conical structure has a modest protrusion of 4  and a slant height of about 25  ( for the sake of comparison , a graphene cone will have a much larger height equal to 14  for a slant height of 25  ) .",
    "this variation in height is well within the range of heights measured for the exposed layer on recently exfoliated black phosphorus stacks .",
    "the initial shape of the conical structure studied in figures [ fig : fig1]b , [ fig : figreel]b , and [ fig : figenergetics]b , can be seen on figure [ fig : fig5]a and has the following salient features : the lower ( upper ) sublayer @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is compressed ( elongated ) near the apex , as indicated by the white ( black ) features on tr(g ) and det(g ) around the structure s geometrical center .",
    "the self - passivated defect is shown in black on tr(g ) and det(g ) to the right of the geometrical center , indicating increased metric invariants there .",
    "this defect did not pin electronic charge within the electronic semiconducting gap,@xcite as can be seen on the _ electronic gap _ subplot in figure [ fig : fig5]a . as a result ,",
    "the band gap remains of the order of 0.89 ev down from 1.1 ev on the planar structure in an effect due to curvature.@xcite the lack of localized states at the defect@xcite may mask its identification by optical probes .",
    "the absorption of o@xmath2 in a planar structure did not increase the curvature significantly , but there is a clear increase in the local magnitude of the gaussian curvature @xmath5 in the conical structure , figure [ fig : fig5]b , as soon as the dimer is absorbed : oxidation increases the curvature of an already non - ideal structure . in terms of experiments ,",
    "this means that a structure with a large height distribution displays local changes of curvature as well , and the bulges seen experimentally after degradation are consistent with an increase of curvature upon oxidation .",
    "the gradual increase of curvature is reaffirmed in figure [ fig : fig5]c .",
    "the electronic gap of this structure reduces , somewhat dramatically , to 0.65 ev signifying a 27% decrease with respect to the gap of the structure seen in figure [ fig : fig5]a .",
    "an increase in amorphization@xcite is evident when the second dimer is part of the bp structure ( figure [ fig : fig5]c ) , and the electronic properties do not seem to be largely modified from what it was discussed in figure [ fig : fig5]b .      the search for mechanisms to explain the oxidation of black phosphorus remains one of the most exciting and challenging problems in the context of this layered material where chemistry plays a fundamental role .",
    "we provided a viable mechanism for the photo - oxidation of bp at intrinsic defects .",
    "intrinsic defects lower the chemisorption barrier of ideal black phosphorus and make the oxidation barrier accessible through the absorption of photons within the visible and ultraviolet range , thus enabling the photo - induced oxidation of bp and the dissociation of oxygen dimers .",
    "we studied energetics of chemisorption and found the oxidation to be highly exothermic .",
    "in addition , the local geometry , electronic properties , and simulated stm images of these structures were discussed as well .",
    "further avenues of study concern the degradation of subsequent layers following similar mechanisms .",
    "this study provides novel insights into the degradation dynamics of this material , and gives rise to a plausible mechanism for the oxidation of black phosphorus when exposed to light .",

    "<S> black phosphorus is a monoatomic semiconducting layered material that degrades exothermically in the presence of light and ambient contaminants . </S>",
    "<S> its degradation dynamics remain largely unknown . even before degradation , local - probe studies indicate non - negligible local curvature through a non - constant height distribution due to the unavoidable presence of intrinsic defects . we establish that these intrinsic defects are photo - oxidation sites because they lower the chemisorption barrier of ideal black phosphorus ( @xmath0 ev and out of visible - range light excitations ) right into the visible and ultra - violet range ( 1.6 to 6.8 ev ) , thus enabling photo - induced oxidation and dissociation of oxygen dimers . </S>",
    "<S> a full characterization of the material s shape and of its electronic properties at the early stages of the oxidation process is presented as well . </S>",
