    "neutron matter is integral to the study of neutron stars and neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron matter has been studied extensively using _ ab initio _",
    "approaches  @xcite .",
    "while neutron matter does not obtain in nature in pure form , its eos is closely connected to that of physical systems .",
    "more specifically , it is direct input into the einstein s field equations ( typically cast as the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations ) that lead to basic observable properties of a neutron star . on the other hand , the neutron - matter eos is also connected to nuclei via the use of nuclear energy density functionals ( edfs ) .",
    "edfs take on a variety of forms  @xcite and are typically fit to empirical data such as nuclear masses and radii .",
    "other constraints may include the eos of neutron matter  @xcite , the neutron - matter pairing gap  @xcite , the energy of a neutron impurity  @xcite , or the properties of a neutron drop  @xcite .",
    "the edf approach is especially useful as it allows for predictions to be made across the nuclear chart .",
    "investigating neutron matter is an excellent opportunity for benchmarking both phenomenological  @xcite and chiral  @xcite nuclear interactions and many - body methods .    while homogeneous matter is an intriguing system , it is not fully representative of either finite systems or astrophysical settings , since nuclei and neutron - star matter are inhomogeneous systems .",
    "the matter in a neutron - star crust is rich with unbound neutrons and also contains a lattice of nuclei .",
    "focussing only on the unbound neutrons , these experience the interaction with the lattice as a periodic modulation .",
    "similarly , nuclei are finite systems : their density eventually drops off as one goes farther away from the center of the nucleus .",
    "thus , as a first approximation , one can study the effects of a one - body external periodic potential on pure infinite neutron matter .",
    "this system , periodically modulated neutron matter , directly mimics the situation in a neutron star ; also , if used as an input constraint to edfs , it can inform us about the physics of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "this problem of an external periodic modulation is known as the _",
    "static response _ of neutron matter : it amounts to a comparison between externally modulated and unmodulated infinite neutron systems .",
    "this problem has been tackled using a variety of approximations in the literature  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "the static response problem has also received a lot of attention in other areas of physics  @xcite .",
    "this includes pioneering quantum monte carlo calculations for strongly correlated systems such as liquid @xmath0 at zero temperature and pressure @xcite and the three - dimensional electron gas @xcite .    in a recent letter   we reported on the first _ ab initio _ calculation of the static response of neutron matter",
    "this included a calculation of the linear density - density static response function of neutron matter following from a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xmath1 approach .",
    "specifically , this involved the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and auxiliary - field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) methods : these are non - perturbative and accurate methods for computing properties of many - body nuclear systems .",
    "reference   also mentioned the role of finite - size effects , the wave - function ansatz , and conclusions that can be drawn on the isovector gradient coefficient of edfs .    in the present article , we expand on ref .  , by discussing finite - size effects and the wave - function ansatz in more detail .",
    "in addition to this , we have carried out new qmc calculations for the periodically modulated system at many different densities , extracting from there edf parameters for several different skyrme parametrizations .",
    "we have also carried out several new calculations of the modulated system for several different strengths and periodicities of the external one - body potential : this includes a study of the lower - density regime , as well as separate simulations ( at both low and intermediate densities ) with and without three - nucleon interactions .",
    "these results provide a more detailed understanding of different effects and , since they are non - perturbative and accurate , they provide `` synthetic data '' that can be used in ( or compared to ) other approaches .",
    "we make some first steps in this direction by examining the response function coming from selected edfs .",
    "we begin with some background on the methods employed ( section  [ sec : methods ] ) , mainly establishing our notation in what follows .",
    "we also provide a more extensive discussion of the theory of static response ( section  [ sec : static ] ) , explaining what the density - density response is , and how it can be extracted from our calculations .",
    "we then proceed to study finite - size effects in the non - interacting problem in detail ( section  [ sec : finite ] ) , before turning to the qmc and edf results for the interacting and periodically modulated problem ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the full interacting problem we study is made up of a non - relativistic kinetic term , a two - nucleon ( nn ) interaction , a three - nucleon ( nnn ) interaction , and a one body potential :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the external potential is motivated by the periodicity of nuclei found in a neutron - star crust .",

    "to summarize , in this article we have investigated the properties of periodically modulated neutron matter , using a combination of large - scale simulations and qualitative insights .",
    "we started from the non - interacting problem , examining in detail finite - size effects : since 66 is the number of particles commonly used for homogeneous neutron matter , we studied the adjustments that need to be carried out in order to use that particle number for the inhomogeneous problem .",
    "we then reported on our auxiliary - field diffusion monte carlo simulations , underlining the importance of optimizing the trial wave function by minimizing the vmc energy .",
    "this depended on a detailed understanding of the single - particle orbitals .",
    "afdmc allowed us to compute the ground - state energy of neutron matter at various densities , potential strengths , and periodicities of the potential .",
    "in particular we studied the inhomogeneous problem by increasing the strength of the potential starting from homogeneity .",
    "we then examined several consequences of our _ ab initio _ results .",
    "we first saw the impact that they have on energy density functionals .",
    "we used the response of neutron matter to constrain the isovector term while carefully disentangling the contributions of bulk and gradient terms .",
    "we found a density - dependent isovector term and provided our estimate for its magnitude at each density .",
    "next , we extracted the linear density - density static response function of neutron matter from afdmc and edf results at two different densities .",
    "this required a set of _ ab initio _",
    "results for each of the periodicities that we studied .",
    "we then compared and contrasted the response function of neutron matter to that of other systems .",
    "more than a proof - of - principle , this work provides detailed benchmarks that other _ ab initio _ calculations can compare to , or edf approaches can use as input .",
    "the authors are grateful to a. bulgac , j. carlson , s. gandolfi , j. w. holt , c. j. pethick , s. reddy , and a. rios for many valuable discussions .",
