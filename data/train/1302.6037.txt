    "since the work of a. connes and d.k kreimer ( see @xcite , @xcite ) in perturbative quantum field theory ( pqft ) , it has been possible to have a purely algebraic interpretation of some renormalization schemes , as the birkhoff decomposition of regularized characters ( with values in a commutative algebra of laurent series ) , that is of elements of the group of algebra morphisms from a graded commutative hopf algebra to the the algebra of laurent series ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "many graded commutative hopf algebras ( shuffle , quasi shuffle , tree ) do appear in this framework and , surprisingly , the same objects ( groups of characters on hopf algebras ) arise in the study of analytic dynamical systems ( see for example @xcite ) , where changes of coordinates can be computed as elements either of the group of formal identity - tangent diffeomorphisms ( namely characters over the fa di bruno hopf algebra ) or of some subgroup that corresponds to characters over a combinatorial hopf algebra of trees or words ( using mould calculus , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such interactions should allow to enrich each domain with the ideas of the other and some steps have already been done in this direction ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of this paper comes from the observation that , in pqft , the need for renormalization comes from the ill - definedness of some character on a hopf algebra , which , after dimensional regularization , is replaced by a character with values in an algebra of laurent series . the attempted character is then obtained with the help of the birkhoff decomposition .",
    "the same phenomenon occur in dynamical systems , in the study of normal forms of vector fields ( when the the change of coordinates that should linearize the vector field is ill - defined ) . apart from some remarks in the literature",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , there does not seem that renormalization schemes have been used to compute , for example , normal forms .",
    "we shall explain in this paper in an abstract algebraic context  a common framework to pqft and dynamical systems  how the ideas developed in pqft ( dimensional regularization , birkhoff decomposition ... ) provide a way to compute normal forms as well as other objects that play a crude role in dynamics .    in the next section , we briefly recall the definition of complete graded lie algebras and their link with commutative hopf algebras .",
    "we define then in section [ secder ] graded derivations on lie algebras and their associated logarithmic derivative . under some invertibilty condition on such derivations",
    ", we define the inverse of such logarithmic derivative ( see also section [ secovin ] ) that generalizes the @xmath1@xmath0 correspondence between a lie algebra and its lie group .",
    "whenever such a derivation is not invertible , the theory of dynamical systems ( see appendix [ secds ] ) , provide , in the framework of lie algebra , a way to study these logarithmic derivatives , using @xmath2-conjugacy and `` normal '' forms ( see section [ secnoninv ] ) .",
    "there are surprising similarities with the need for renormalization in pqft , the same ideas regularization and birkhoff decomposition ",
    "provide a new method to compute normal forms ( section [ norenor ] ) and the analogy goes even further , see section [ secmore ] , since such notions as the locality of counter terms or the choice among several `` renormalization schemes '' also appear here .",
    "in the sequel we consider complete graded lie algebras @xmath3 ( as well as complete vector spaces or algebras ) over a field @xmath4 of characteristic 0 . in other words , @xmath3 is the completion @xmath5 of a graded lie algebra @xmath6 ( with finite dimensional graded components @xmath7 and @xmath8 \\subset l^k_{n + m}$ ] ) with respect to the graduation .",
    "we write for short @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and the lie bracket extends to the completion @xmath3 : if @xmath11 and @xmath12 then @xmath13 = \\sum_{n \\geqslant 1 } z_n$ ] with @xmath14\\ ] ] under these hypotheses , the universal enveloping algebra @xmath15 of @xmath3 is a unital , graded associative algebra with a graduation @xmath16 component @xmath17 .",
    "this algebra turns into a graded co - commutative hopf algebra for the graded co - product defined on @xmath3 by @xmath18 that extends , thanks to the universal property of lie algebras , to @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "using once again the graduation , we note @xmath19 the completion of @xmath15 and , as a graded map the co - product extends to a map from @xmath20 to the completion of @xmath21 ( that may only contain @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath20 is not necessarily a hopf algebra but it contains @xmath3 as the lie algebra of _ primitive elements _ of @xmath20 , that is the elements @xmath23 of @xmath20 such that @xmath24 , but also the lie group @xmath25 of group - like elements of @xmath20 , that is the elements @xmath23 of @xmath20 such that @xmath26 .",
    "let us also remind that there is a one to one correspondence between @xmath3 and @xmath25 , using the well - defined exponential an logarithm : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .    for a given commutative @xmath4algebra @xmath29 , one can also consider the lie algebra @xmath30 , which inherits grading of @xmath3 and is defined as the completion , for the same graduation as in @xmath3 , of the lie algebra @xmath31 with the lie bracket @xmath32 = ( ab)\\otimes[x , y]\\ ] ] note that @xmath30 is both a vector space over @xmath4 ( whose graded component may be of infinite dimension ) and a module over @xmath29 ( with graded components of finite dimension ) and one can as well define @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    there is no difficulty to extend iteratively this construction .",
    "for example , if @xmath35 , then @xmath36 and the same inclusions hold for the completed enveloping algebras as well as for the groups . on the same way",
    ", we could define @xmath37 as the completion of @xmath38 . in the sequel",
    ", we will adopt this lie algebra point of view but there is no difficulty to identify such lie algebra @xmath39 ( resp .",

    "characters ) on a graded commutative algebra , with values in @xmath29 .",
    "the reader can refer to @xcite on this matter .",
    "this simply means that the ideas stemming from the study of characters on hopf algebras can be easily translated in the context of such lie algebras .",
    "let us give , as an example , a `` toy model '' stemming from the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "when dealing with the simple differential equation : @xmath41 the lie algebra ( over @xmath42 ) of differential operator ( or vector fields ) , @xmath43 appears with a natural action on series of @xmath44 $ ] and the elements of the completion of @xmath45 are formal operators @xmath46 with @xmath47 $ ] . for short we write @xmath48\\partial_y$ ] this lie algebra . note that it coincides , for a different graduation , with the lie algebra @xmath49 with @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 .    as another example related to dynamical systems ,",

    "this suggests to explore similar `` differential '' equations that may lead to new correspondences between lie algebras and lie groups , since such equations appear naturally in the framework of differential equations ( see section [ secds ] ) .    in the case of our toy model ,",

    "<S> we study in this paper logarithmic derivatives associated to derivations on graded complete lie algebra , as well as the existence of inverses . these logarithmic derivatives , when invertible , generalize the @xmath0@xmath1 correspondence between a lie algebra and its lie group . </S>",
    "<S> such correspondences occur naturally in the study of dynamical systems when dealing with the linearization of vector fields and the non  linearizability of a resonant vector fields corresponds to the non  invertibility of a logarithmic derivative and to the existence of normal forms . </S>",
    "<S> these concepts , stemming from the theory of dynamical systems , can be rephrased in the abstract setting of lie algebra and the same difficulties as in perturbative quantum field theory ( pqft ) arise here . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , one can adopt the same ideas as in pqft with fruitful results such as new constructions of normal forms with the help of the birkhoff decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> the analogy goes even further ( locality of counter terms , choice of a renormalization scheme ) and shall lead to more interactions between dynamical systems and quantum field theory . </S>"
