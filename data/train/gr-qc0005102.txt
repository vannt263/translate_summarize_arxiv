    "quantum field theory in curved spacetimes does not contain in itself a unique specification of the quantum state of the system  @xcite .",
    "even in minkowski spacetime , where the existence of the poincar group singles out a special state , the minkowski vacuum , it is certainly of interest to consider states that are non - invariant under poincar transformations , since they contain all the information about the physical excitations and dynamics of the theory .",
    "such non - vacuum states are also necessary in a general initial value formulation of the back - reaction problem in both curved and flat spacetimes . in flat space",
    "the initial value problem for arbitrary physically allowable states has been formulated and studied for both qed and scalar @xmath13 theory in the large @xmath14 limit , principally for time varying but spatially homogeneous mean fields  @xcite .",
    "the simplest situation in which the back - reaction problem can be studied in curved spacetime is that of a free scalar field in a spatially homogeneous and isotropic robertson - walker ( rw ) cosmology , where the geometry is characterized by just one non - trivial function of time . the wave equation for a free scalar field in such a geometry can be separated and expressed in terms of a complete set of time dependent mode functions .",
    "the general initial value problem is specified by giving initial data for this complete set at a given initial time .",
    "the back - reaction of the quantum scalar field(s ) on the rw geometry can be studied then by constructing the renormalized expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 of the field(s ) and solving ( numerically ) the semi - classical einstein equations , augmented by higher derivative terms required by renormalization@xcite . as in the flat space examples ,",
    "this semi - classical back - reaction problem becomes exact in the large @xmath14 limit , with @xmath14 the number of identical scalar fields  @xcite .    as a prelude to the dynamical back - reaction problem in cosmological spacetimes",
    "it is necessary to study non - vacuum states first in fixed rw backgrounds .",
    "the maximally symmetric de sitter spacetime is of particular interest .",
    "most previous work has focused on maximally symmetric @xmath16 de sitter invariant states or the special @xmath17 invariant state found by allen  @xcite . since the universe is not globally @xmath16 invariant , a more generic set of initial conditions , consistent only with rw symmetry and general principles of renormalization of @xmath10",
    "is required for cosmology .",
    "the investigation of these much weaker requirements and specification of the general initial value problem for back - reaction calculations was initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the behavior of the renormalized @xmath4 for arbitrary physically admissable spatially homogeneous and isotropic states in a fixed de sitter background .",
    "we argue in section iii that such states must be fourth order adiabatic states  @xcite that also possess an infrared finite two - point function . in de sitter space the wave equation for free scalar fields can be solved exactly for arbitrary values of the mass and the curvature coupling .",
    "its solutions depend only on the wave number @xmath18 of the mode and the parameter @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the constant scalar curvature of de sitter spacetime . for @xmath21 ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath3 , we prove that for _ all _ uv and ir physically allowed initial states the renormalized value of @xmath15 at late times asymptotically approaches that of the euclidean or bunch - davies de sitter invariant state  @xcite .",
    "the conformally invariant scalar field ( @xmath6 ,  @xmath22 ) falls into this class .",
    "the case @xmath23 corresponding to @xmath24 is more delicate .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are separately zero ( the massless , minimally coupled case ) , then we prove that the renormalized @xmath4 for all physically admissable states approaches the allen - folacci de sitter invariant value  @xcite .",
    "numerical evidence for this result was found previously in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we provide an analytic proof that late time attractor behavior occurs for _ all _ physically admissable rw states , when @xmath25 and @xmath26 . if @xmath24 but @xmath11 and @xmath1 are not separately zero ( so that one of them is negative ) we prove that @xmath10 grows linearly in rw comoving ( cosmic ) time without bound , and this asymptotic behavior is independent of the state of the field .",
    "finally , and in contrast , in the case @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath28 , @xmath10 depends sensitively on the state and , for most values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , grows exponentially at late times for all states .",
    "this case is of considerably less physical relevance , since it corresponds to a tachyonic field theory with no stable vacuum state .    the asymptotic approach of @xmath10 to a de sitter invariant form , independently of the lower symmetry of the initial data when @xmath29 is a striking result .",
    "certainly no such attractor behavior of @xmath10 , independent of initial conditions occurs in minkowski space for any mass .",
    "one may regard this result as a kind of cosmic `` no hair '' theorem for scalar quantum fields in de sitter space .",
    "for @xmath30 it is in accord with one s classical intuition that any initial energy density satisfying the weak energy condition ( @xmath31 ) is redshifted away by the exponential de sitter expansion , although as we will see , the redshifting of the quantum @xmath10 is not that of classical matter or radiation . at",
    "asymptotically late times what is left behind is a kind of frozen quantum vacuum energy `` condensate , '' satisfying the de sitter invariant equation of state @xmath32 .",
    "this result justifies the choice of the bunch - davies vacuum in calculations of quantum fluctuations of _ free _ fields , _",
    "i.e. _ without back - reaction , in a long - lived de sitter expansion phase of inflationary cosmological models . for @xmath23 , @xmath33 , the approach of @xmath10 to the de sitter invariant allen - folacci value is perhaps more surprising .",
    "as shown in section iv one expects the leading order contribution of the modes to @xmath10 in this case to be constant in comoving time at late times .",
    "in fact this occurs if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not separately zero for all the modes .",
    "however when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both zero , the leading order contributions to @xmath10 of all the modes _ except the spatially homogeneous one _",
    ", for an arbitrary physically admissable state have exactly zero coefficient , the subleading contributions redshift away , and we are left only with the with the de sitter invariant allen - folacci constant value at late times . the finite difference from the bunch - davies value",
    "may be attributed entirely to the constant behavior of the spatially homogeneous mode contributing to the vacuum energy condensate in de sitter space .    in all those cases for which @xmath29 when @xmath4 approaches a de sitter invariant value at late times , the quantum expectation value loses all its initial state dependence and hence its asymptotic value",
    "must be determined purely by the background geometry .",
    "when the mass of the field vanishes , the existence of only one covariantly conserved local geometrical tensor of adiabatic order four in de sitter space , namely @xmath34 given by eq . ( [ eq : hthr ] ) below , permits us to identify the asymptotic value of @xmath10 in the vacuum energy condensate with this tensor .",
    "since @xmath8 can not be derived by variation of a covariant local action , but corresponds instead to a certain well defined non - local term in the quantum effective action  @xcite , the asymptotic vacuum energy condensate of the quantum field is determined by the global or extreme infrared properties of de sitter space .",
    "the form of the non - local effective action is determined by the trace anomaly in conformally flat spacetimes .",
    "since the approach of @xmath10 to a de sitter invariant value occurs for all @xmath26 , the existence of this term in the effective action for massless fields is much more general than the strict definition of the trace anomaly in the conformally invariant case .",
    "hence the asymptotic late time behavior of @xmath10 in de sitter space can be used to define a generalized trace `` anomaly '' coefficient in the massless but non - conformally invariant cases , @xmath35 . as we show by consideration of the covariant @xmath36 function method  @xcite , this coefficient is exactly the same as that which determines the infrared response of the vacuum condensate to global weyl rescalings .",
    "hence the significance of the state - independence of the vacuum energy condensate in de sitter space is that it determines certain conformal properties of non - conformal field theories in the extreme infrared .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : scalar ] we give the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor as a mode sum for an arbitrary homogeneous and isotropic , physically admissable state with a non - zero initial particle number of the scalar field . in section [ sec : analytic ]",
    "we analyze the late time behavior of expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor in de sitter space in flat spatial sections and show that it approaches the de sitter invariant bunch - davies value for all @xmath37 , independently of the initial state . in section [ sec : nu32 ] we analyze the limit @xmath38 in closed spatial sections in order to keep careful track of the spatially homogeneous mode in a discrete basis , and show how the allen - folacci fixed point at late times is obtained for the massless minimally coupled field .",
    "we also investigate the asymptotic behavior of the energy - momentum tensor for arbitrary mass and curvature coupling when @xmath39 . in section [ sec : numerical ] we illustrate the analytic results with numerical studies , investigating in particular the interesting case when @xmath40 is slightly smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "we find that for many states when @xmath40 is only slightly smaller than @xmath41 the energy - momentum tensor first approaches the allen - folacci value and only much later approaches the bunch - davies value . in section [ sec :",
    "scaling ] we consider the geometric significance of the state independent asymptotic behavior of @xmath10 , relating it to the quantum effective action which determines the behavior of @xmath42 under global weyl scaling and providing the generalization of the trace `` anomaly '' in the infrared , for @xmath43 . section [ sec : discussion ] contains some discussion and final conclusions .",
    "there are two appendices .",
    "appendix a completes the proof of the bunch - davies attractor behavior in the cases of integer and pure imaginary @xmath40 , while appendix b contains a discussion of the simple harmonic oscillator in the limit of vanishing frequency , which shares many features with the spatially constant mode in de sitter spacetime .",

    "expectation values of the bilinears @xmath76 and @xmath77 in a general state need not be considered since they can be removed by a time - independent bogoliubov transformation at the initial time  @xcite .",
    "hence these initial state correlations may be parameterized instead by the initial data on the mode functions @xmath64 , together with the non - negative set of @xmath74 , with no loss of generality .",
    "since the expectation value of the unrenormalized energy - momentum tensor @xmath78 is quartically divergent , a procedure for defining a finite , renormalized expectation value must be given .",
    "we will follow the adiabatic regularization method  @xcite . in this method the renormalization counterterms",

    "they are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the renormalized energy - momentum tensor is then @xmath80 this subtraction scheme is not manifestly covariant in form , since space and time are treated quite differently .",
    "however , adiabatic regularization is equivalent to a covariant point splitting procedure in which the points are split only in the spacelike hypersurface of constant @xmath44  @xcite , and the _ value _ of the renormalized @xmath10 obtained by this procedure is the same as in a strictly covariant one",
    ". hence this subtraction procedure does correspond to adjustment of counterterms to the quantum effective action , and @xmath81 is covariantly conserved . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite the adiabatic terms in all cases consist of an integral rather than a sum over @xmath18 .",
    "the reason is that subtraction corresponds to purely local counterterms in the effective action , and thus must be independent of the global compactness or non - compactness of the spatial sections .",
    "for an arbitrary homogeneous and isotropic state to be physically admissible the renormalized energy - momentum tensor defined by the adiabatic order four subtractions in ( [ eq : trenorm ] ) must be both ultraviolet and infrared finite .",
    "in a general rw spacetime , ultraviolet finiteness for a field with non - conformal coupling to the scalar curvature requires that the particular solution of the mode equation ( [ eq : mode ] ) in a general physical state must match the fourth order adiabatic form at large @xmath18 , with the deviations from the fourth order wkb form falling faster than @xmath82 .",
    "likewise the initial number @xmath74 must fall faster than @xmath82 at large @xmath18 , for the mode sums ( integrals ) to be ultraviolet convergent .",
    "this is equivalent to the requirement that the two - point function of the scalar field have the vacuum hadamard form  @xcite to sufficiently high order in the short distance expansion as the points approach one another .",
    "as long as there are two linearly independent complex oscillatory solutions to the equation ( [ eq : mode ] ) , the wronskian normalization condition ( [ eq : wronskian ] ) can be imposed and the state will be free of any infrared divergences . however , when @xmath83 for some low @xmath18 in de sitter space no such complex oscillatory solutions to ( [ eq : mode ] ) exist and the infrared finiteness requirement on the both the energy - momentum tensor and the two - point function of the physical state becomes non - trivial , as we discuss in detail in section iv .",
    "a useful variation of the method of adiabatic regularization has been developed by two of us  @xcite . in this method one first computes a quantity @xmath84 , obtained by expanding the adiabatic counterterms @xmath85 in inverse powers of @xmath18 and truncating at order @xmath86 .",
    "the same renormalized energy - momentum tensor defined in eq .",

    "the advantage of this splitting is that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are separately conserved , and moreover , @xmath91 may be computed analytically in terms of the scale factor @xmath46 and its derivatives  @xcite .",
    "thus the state dependence of the renormalized @xmath81 resides completely in @xmath90 , which can be computed numerically .",
    "we restrict our consideration henceforth to the particular maximally symmetric rw background of de sitter space .",

    "the asymptotic behavior of the energy - momentum tensor does not depend on @xmath103 so the bulk of the analysis will be carried out in the flat ( @xmath104 ) coordinates .",
    "however , when we turn to the massless , minimally coupled limit in the next section , it will become useful to have a discrete @xmath18 basis in order to separate out the @xmath105 spatially homogeneous mode explicitly , since it is the most infrared sensitive .",
    "no confusion should be caused by our use of the same symbol @xmath44 for conformal time in both cases of flat and closed spatial sections , since we make use of only the @xmath104 coordinates in this section and only the @xmath63 coordinates in the next section .",

    "this condition is necessary for an arbitrary ( spatially homogeneous ) state to posses a finite energy - momentum tensor after the fourth order adiabatic subtraction defined by ( [ eq : trenorm ] ) .",

    "thus the most general physically acceptable uv states are fourth order adiabatic states . ] .",
    "we shall require also that the arbitrary physical state possess a two - point function and energy - momentum tensor which are free of any infrared divergences . because the canonical dimension of @xmath130 is four whereas that of @xmath138 is two , the conditions ( [ eq : ckbound ] ) and ( [ eq : nkbound ] ) which require finiteness of @xmath139 are more restrictive in the uv , whereas the condition of finiteness of @xmath140 is more restrictive in the ir .",
    "these two sets of conditions will be sufficient to demonstrate that the energy - momentum tensor for _ any _ uv and ir admissible physical state approaches the bd value at late times for @xmath141 .    to understand why such a result is to be expected and outline the more detailed proof which we give below ,",
    "let us observe that at late times @xmath142 , the general state mode function ( [ eq : psik0 ] ) behaves like @xmath143 substituting this into ( [ eq : t00u ] ) and ( [ eq : tru ] ) shows that to leading order at late times the contributions to the mode sums of the unrenormalized energy - momentum tensor behave like @xmath144 for @xmath40 real . since the renormalization counterterms are state independent  @xcite , the state dependent terms are the same in the unrenormalized and renormalized energy - momentum tensor .",
    "one can perform all the uv renormalization in the bd state at a fixed time and collect the remaining finite state dependent terms which are unaffected by the subtraction procedure , and they all fall off at least as fast as @xmath145 as @xmath142 for @xmath146 .",
    "these remaining finite state dependent terms in the energy density and trace are expressible as integrals over the wave number @xmath18 with the general form @xmath147 where @xmath148 is one of the four state dependent , but time independent functions @xmath149&&(1",

    "the essential point is that all the state dependent mode integrals of the form ( [ eq : genint ] ) are _ uniformly _ convergent for all @xmath44 ( including @xmath153 ) at both their lower limit , @xmath154 , and their upper limit @xmath155 , due to the ir and uv finiteness of the state .",
    "hence the limit of @xmath142 can be taken _ inside _ the integral over @xmath18 . since ,",
    "as table 1 shows , all the @xmath156 behave like @xmath157 as @xmath158 , for @xmath37 , it follows that @xmath159 and all the state dependent contributions to @xmath160 vanish at late times .",
    "the validity of bringing the limit inside the integral depends on the uniform convergence of the integral at both its upper and lower limits . in the form ( [ eq : genint ] ) the behavior of the @xmath161 factor at small arguments ( and the absence of any ir divergence from the @xmath148 factor ) clearly guarantees the uniform convergence at the lower limit .",
    "however , the change of variables @xmath162 brings the integral ( [ eq : genint ] ) into the form @xmath163 in this form it is clear that the uniform convergence of the integral at its upper limit is guaranteed by the falloff of the state dependent mode functions at large @xmath18 , namely @xmath164 equations ( [ eq : slim ] ) and ( [ eq : rlim ] ) guarantee that both the ir and uv contributions go to zero as @xmath165 for @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , we can go one step further by using the information from the fourth order adiabatic nature of the state @xmath166 to conclude that the uv contribution to the integral from @xmath167 , and very large @xmath168 in ( [ eq : genintz ] ) falls faster than @xmath169 as @xmath170 .",
    "this is faster than the ir contribution which falls only as @xmath171 if @xmath172 .",

    "these give an ir dominant , ( _ i.e. _ finite @xmath18 , @xmath175 ) contribution of the form , @xmath176 as @xmath177 .",
    "this last integral is guaranteed to converge at its upper limit for all @xmath178 , and in particular for @xmath179 by ( [ eq : adbr ] ) .",

    "in the latter case @xmath1 is so small that @xmath416 and the slope are nearly vanishing and the energy density stays close to the af value until times of order @xmath417 , which is much larger than the times shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath305 ( still keeping @xmath6 ) both @xmath416 and the slope vanishes identically , so the energy - momentum tensor goes to the af value and remains there .",
    "this demonstrates that the limit @xmath418 is quite continuous when viewed at finite times with well - defined physical initial conditions , although the late time limit is discontinuous .",
    "in the case @xmath23 there are two distinct behaviors depending on whether @xmath0 and @xmath1 are separately vanishing or not . in the massless , minimally coupled case we proved in section [ sec : nu32 ] that the allen - folacci value is a fixed point at late times . in figure 4",
    "we show the approach of the energy density , pressure , and trace to their allen - folacci values for the massless minimally coupled field .",

    "we show the behavior of the energy density and trace for the case @xmath422 and @xmath423 when the field is in a fourth order adiabatic vacuum state .",
    "when @xmath424 the analysis at the end of section [ sec : nu32 ] shows that the leading order state dependent terms in the energy - momentum tensor will generally grow exponentially with time .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "the exponential growth that occurs here is similar to the well known one for the classical scalar field when @xmath0 and @xmath1 have values such that @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "such fields are tachyonic and presumbably of little physical interest unless interactions are added to stabilize them .",
    "we have found that for all @xmath21 the renormalized expectation value of @xmath10 approaches the de sitter invariant bunch - davies value for any physically admissable initial state , whereas it approaches the de sitter invariant allen - folacci value for any physically admissable initial state in the massless , minimally coupled case . since all the initial state dependence vanishes asymptotically , these state independent de sitter invariant fixed point values for @xmath160 must be purely geometrical in origin .",
    "indeed , both the bunch - davies point - splitting calculation and the hadamard calculation of allen - folacci rely only on the properties of the two - point function of the scalar field @xmath425 for @xmath426 .",
    "hence , the bd and af asymptotic values of @xmath160 are certainly `` pseudo - local '' in the terminology of ref .",

    "although we have used adiabatic subtraction methods to renormalize @xmath10 it is known that the value of @xmath139 so obtained is equal to that in a fully covariant procedure such as dimensional regularization or covariant point - splitting  @xcite . in a fully covariant procedure , which yields a local conserved tensor of fourth adiabatic order , only the riemann tensor together with its covariant derivatives and contractions can appear .",
    "hence @xmath160 for @xmath6 must be expressible entirely in terms of such local geometrical tensors .    in four dimensions",

    "@xmath37 we have shown that for all fourth order adiabatic states that are infrared finite the energy - momentum tensor approaches the bd value at late times .",
    "the longest time scale for the state dependent terms to redshift away is @xmath488 .",
    "this has been numerically verified for various values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 when the fields are in a fourth order adiabatic state . for the case",
    "in which @xmath489 and @xmath0 and @xmath1 are small , we numerically observe a more complicated behavior .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor quickly approaches the af value and grows then linearly with comoving time .",
    "our analytic proof implies that it must then slowly decay to the bd value .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath490 the redshift of the state dependent terms in the quantum expectation value of @xmath491 is slower than one might guess from the redshifting of classical matter or radiation , _ i.e. _ @xmath492 or @xmath493 , respectively .    for the case",
    "@xmath494 we have to distinguish two different possibilities . if the field is massless and minimally coupled then we have proven that , for all fourth order adiabatic states that are infrared finite , the energy - momentum tensor approaches the af value at late times .",
    "this is true for both vacuum and initially populated states . for any other values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 the renormalized energy - momentum tensor grows linearly with comoving time , indicating that back - reaction effects need to be taken into account .",
    "the sign of the linear growth depends on the sign of @xmath1 .    for the tachyonic cases @xmath495",
    "there is no attractor state . instead , for most values of @xmath11 and @xmath1 the renormalized energy - momentum tensor grows like @xmath496 at late times for all physically admissable states .",
    "thus back - reaction effects again need to be taken into account .    for the cases in which either the bunch - davies or allen - folacci states serve as attractors in the above sense and the mass , @xmath0 of the field is zero , we have shown how these results are connected to the appearance of a certain non - local term in the quantum effective action for the scalar field .",
    "this term gives rise to the local geometrical tensor @xmath8 in the asymptotic form of @xmath15 at late times , and also determines the global scaling behavior of the effective action for massless fields .",
    "determining this scaling behavior and relating it to the asymptotic @xmath15 in de sitter space has allowed us to generalize the notion of the trace anomaly to massless , non - conformally coupled scalar fields , in the sense that the coefficient of this non - local term in the effective action is well defined even for @xmath35 .",
    "the interplay between the uv and ir properties of the state and the mode sums contributing to the energy - momentum tensor is a theme running through all of these results .",
    "we had to be careful to remove the uv divergences from the unrenormalized @xmath10 in order to analyze the late time limit .",
    "since we have found state independent de sitter invariant results in both the @xmath231 and massless , minimally coupled cases , and since all the state dependence resides in the finite @xmath18 modes , their form at high @xmath18 being restricted by the requirement of matching the adiabatic order four vacuum , it is clear that state independent results for @xmath350 are possible only because the contribution to the bd or af expectation value comes from arbitrarily large @xmath18 at very late times .",
    "in fact , inspection of the renormalized expectation value of @xmath2 expressed as a mode sum , after the fourth order adiabatic subtraction has been made , shows that the finite contribution comes from @xmath497 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the physical wavelength of the mode is of order of the de sitter horizon . at very late times , this corresponds to arbitrarily large values of the coordinate wave number @xmath18 .",
    "the finite difference between the bd value and the af value in the @xmath498 case comes entirely from the @xmath105 mode in closed spatial sections , which is a purely ir effect .",
    "this leads to a finite discontinuity in the infrared scaling properties of a massless field since the value of the energy - momentum tensor at @xmath499 is different from its value in the limit @xmath6 and @xmath309 .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath8 tensor and the corresponding non - local action is quite generic for massless fields ; its coefficient @xmath436 vanishes only if the mass is non - zero .",
    "hence we should expect that , although they are certainly not conformal , gravitons will also contribute to this same infrared effective action with a finite value of @xmath436 , which can be determined in the same way by a background de sitter calculation of their quantum @xmath10 at late times .",
    "we plan to present the results of this calculation in a future publication .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the coefficient of the generalized trace anomaly , @xmath436 , is not generically positive , in contrast to all the previously known examples of massless conformal fields  @xcite .",
    "it appears that the reason for this is that a positive @xmath436 comes from the ultraviolet behavior of @xmath15 for conformal fields , while the infrared behavior of non - conformal fields can contribute a negative value . for any",
    "@xmath500 the new term in the effective action leads to dynamics for the rw scale factor which is quite different from the einstein theory , and remains to be investigated in a full dynamical back - reaction calculation .",

    "our initial state trial wave functional ( [ gaus ] ) then remains a bounded gaussian functional , consistent with semi - classical mean field methods ( although it may well spread over time depending on the dynamics ) .",
    "as should be clear , the non - normalizable positive frequency vacuum with @xmath584 and @xmath613 is analogous to the bunch - davies vacuum , while the normalizable state related to it by an infinite bogoliubov transformation ( but only a finite shift in zero point energy ) is analogous to the allen - folacci states parameterized by @xmath333 and @xmath334 or @xmath614 and @xmath595 .",
    "however , whereas the energy of the normalizable state is finite and arbitrary , depending on the arbitrary @xmath615 coefficient in ( [ ener ] ) , and the non - normalizable positive frequency state has zero energy in this simple harmonic oscillator example , the converse is true at late times in de sitter space .",
    "this is due to the different kinematics and form of the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field in the de sitter case .",

    "_ @xmath616 shows that the difference is the redshift factor of @xmath399 multiplying the infrared finite @xmath617 in the de sitter case .",
    "thus , whereas this can take on the finite state dependent value @xmath615 in the harmonic oscillator example , its asymptotic late time value vanishes in de sitter space when multiplied by @xmath399 , and becomes state independent in any infrared finite state .",
    "further , in the simple harmonic oscillator the usual ground state becomes an eigenstate of @xmath610 and has zero energy as @xmath539 , since @xmath618 drops out of the energy in this limit , whereas in the de sitter case , since @xmath1 goes to zero only _ linearly _ with @xmath211 , the bunch - davies expectation value receives a finite contribution from the @xmath105 mode from the infinite spread in @xmath619 which has no @xmath399 redshift factor in ( [ eq : epsosc ] ) ."
