    "one of the aims of studying the relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to create , study and understand a system of deconfined states of quarks and gluons commonly known as the _ quark - gluon - plasma _ ( qgp ) .",

    "measurements in @xmath2 collisions define a baseline for drawing a definite conclusion in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "recently , measurements of multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions have been reported for charged particles at midrapidity in @xmath2 collisions for @xmath3 = 0.9 , 2.36 , and 7 tev by alice , cms and atlas experiments at cern - lhc  @xcite .",
    "photon measurements provide complementary information .",

    "the present analysis uses data from the photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) .",
    "the pmd is a preshower detector with a three radiation length thick lead converter sandwiched between two planes of highly granular gas proportional counters .",
    "the information from one of the detector planes , placed in front of the converter is used to veto the charged particles , whereas the preshower data from the other detector plane is used for photon identification  @xcite . in the present analysis data from preshower plane only is used .",
    "we use triggered event sample ( or between the signals from the silicon pixel detector and the vzero , @xmath4 @xmath5  @xcite ) which corresponds to the minimum bias inelastic ( _ inel _ ) events .",
    "events with vertex z - position within @xmath6 10 cm from the interaction point are analyzed .",
    "the total number of events used in the analysis after the trigger and the vertex selections is around 390 k.",
