    "it is well known that an atomic three - level system in v - configuration driven by laser fields gives rise to many interesting quantum optical effects @xcite .",
    "if the two atomic upper states are closely - spaced such that the two transitions to the ground state interact with the same vacuum modes , quantum interference may occur . in this case",
    ", there are more than one pathways to the lower state which can not be distinguished in principle @xcite .",
    "one consequence of this is a possible modification of the resonance fluorescence spectrum of the atom allowing e.g. for quantum beat oscillations @xcite , dark states @xcite , macroscopic dark periods @xcite or very narrow resonances @xcite .",
    "the atomic three level system may also be in @xmath0-configuration @xcite . while this system has been studied as intensively as the v - system in most configurations , interference effects in the @xmath0-system",
    "have received less attention .",
    "one reason for this might be that in this system , interference is not so obvious due to the fact that there are two lower states as possible final states . also it is a strong restriction that both in the v- and in the @xmath0-system the transitions have to interact with the same vacuum modes for interference effects to occur . in practice , this condition is difficult to meet . for the v - system ,",
    "a dressed state realization was found some years ago using an atomic two - level system where one of the two states is coherently coupled to an auxiliary level @xcite .",
    "this makes the system much easier to access in practice .",
    "a corresponding realization for the @xmath0-system was only recently found @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the response of a @xmath0-system with interference to a strong driving field was studied .",
    "it was shown that a dark state which is present in the system without interference @xcite may vanish with interference in the limit of high driving intensity .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that the @xmath0-system with maximum quantum interference can be realized using a dressed state picture of a coherently driven v - system without interference .",
    "this equivalence may be used to physically interpret the features of the system .",
    "@xcite examined the pump - probe response of the @xmath0-system , where interference allows for quantitative changes .    in this paper",
    "we give a physical interpretation for the interference in the @xmath0-system .",
    "we show that the dark state may also be suppressed if the driving field intensity is low .",
    "finally we discuss a narrow spectral feature found in the resonance fluorescence spectrum of the atom with interference utilizing the equivalence of the system to the corresponding dressed state representation .",

    "our aim is to study interference effects in the given system .",

    "@xmath23 is a measure for the quantum interference exhibited by the system .",
    "it depends on the value of @xmath24 and on the relative direction of the two transition dipole elements . in the case of maximum interference with parallel dipole moments",
    "@xmath23 is equal to unity , while @xmath25 represents the case of no quantum interference .",
    "the equations of motion can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a time independent time evolution matrix and @xmath28 is a constant vector , both given by ( [ eoms ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we denote the @xmath29th element of the vector @xmath30 as @xmath31 .    to calculate the resonance fluorescence spectrum we need to calculate the two time correlation function @xmath32 @xcite given as @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the respective transition dipole moments with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "splitting up @xmath30 into its average and the deviation from the average , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , we obtain four terms corresponding to the average motion and four terms corresponding to the fluctuations .",

    "in this section we calculate the resonance fluorescence spectra emitted by the given system . in the first part we use the results of ( [ inel - spec ] ) for a numerical analysis of the incoherent contribution to the spectrum . in the second part , we discuss some of the system properties using analytical arguments .",

    "there are parameter ranges where the system of interest exhibits a dark state @xcite . in such a dark state ,",
    "the steady state population of the upper atomic level and thus the total fluorescence intensity vanishes .",
    "the dark state may be destroyed by a finite laser bandwidth @xcite or by applying thermal or squeezed fields @xcite .",
    "for these schemes , quantum interference is not needed .",
    "however as pointed out in @xcite , the dark state may also be suppressed by quantum interference such that the system is in a dark state without interference @xmath72 , but not with interference @xmath73 .",
    "for this , the rabi frequency does not need to be very high if the two lower levels are close to each other .",
    "for example , for @xmath65 and @xmath66 we have with maximum interference ( @xmath48 ) @xmath74 thus for @xmath75 , the system is in a dark state without the interference , but not with quantum interference . without interference ,",
    "the dark state results from coherent population trapping as for @xmath75 both transitions are driven resonantly .",
    "the suppression of the dark state is crucial for the narrow peak , as it is most pronounced for low values of @xmath24 such that the total intensity becomes low without the interference .    using the fact that the system studied here with full quantum interference ( @xmath48 ) is equivalent to an appropriately chosen three - level system in v - configuration without quantum interference @xcite ,",
    "the results for the narrow peak for such a v - system in @xcite can be rewritten to analytically describe the narrow peak in the @xmath0-system with interference . with @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    "we obtain as approximate expressions for the full width at half height @xmath76 and the relative height @xmath77 for the peak : @xmath78 these analytical expressions are in good agreement with the numerical results . as in the corresponding v - system with interference @xcite ,",
    "the width is proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "but the height @xmath77 is inversely proportional to this factor in both our and the corresponding v - system .",
    "thus the relative intensity @xmath80 is independent of the energy splitting @xmath24 of the two lower levels as long as it is small enough to account for quantum interference .",
    "however in the corresponding v - system with interference , the total fluorescence intensity completely vanishes for @xmath81 and @xmath48 in our notation @xcite .",
    "the atom only emits fluorescence light if @xmath23 is slightly less than unity .",
    "this effect is not present in our system .",
    "the equivalence of the system discussed here with a corresponding system without interference may also be used to explain why an appropriately changed detuning may increase the peak intensity as in @xcite .",
    "two interfering paths from @xmath82 to @xmath3 .",
    "the dashed line denotes spontaneous decay , the solid lines denote laser - induced transitions.,height=113 ]    as compared to a three - level system in @xmath0-configuration with well - separated lower levels , the system presented here has a distinctively different behavior for several parameter ranges due to interference effects .",
    "quantum interference occurs in systems with transitions for which there are at least two different ways to one final state which can not be distinguished in principle .",
    "a typical example for this is the two - slit experiment @xcite . in an atomic three - level system in v - configuration with closely - spaced upper levels ,",
    "quantum interference is possible because the energy arising from the decay of one of the upper levels may excite the atom into the other upper level due to the coupling through the same vacuum modes .",
    "this introduces an extra coherence between the two upper states .",
    "a driving laser field may couple to this coherence and thus account for interference effects also in the resonance fluorescence spectrum . in the @xmath0-system considered here ,",
    "the possibility for quantum interference is not so obvious .",
    "however there are interfering pathways to _ each _ of the final states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "also in this system , there is an extra coherence term between the two lower levels due to the spontaneous decay from the upper level .",
    "the driving laser field couples to this coherence and allows for additional paths for the transitions from the upper to the lower levels .",
    "two interfering paths for transition @xmath83 are shown in [ pic - paths ] .",
    "the laser - induced transition from @xmath2 to @xmath3 is possible because the energy difference @xmath84 between the two lower states is within the energy uncertainty of the two transitions .",
    "the interfering pathways with final state @xmath2 are equivalent to the ones shown in [ pic - paths ] .    due to the interference",
    ", the dark state usually found in a @xmath0-system without interference ( @xcite ) may be suppressed .",
    "this can be used to find parameter ranges where the additional narrow peak is especially narrow and intense .",
    "the various other spectral features found in section [ sec - spec ] may be explained using a dressed state picture such as described in @xcite for a three - level system in v - configuration .",
    "we have calculated and discussed the resonance fluorescence spectrum of an atomic three - level system in @xmath0-configuration where the two lower states are closely - spaced . both transitions",

    "this allows to choose the system parameters favorably for an additional narrow peak centered at the laser frequency .",
    "although quantum interference is not so obvious in the given system because of the fact that there are two final states , the other spectral features are found to be analogous to the spectra of a laser - driven three - level system in v - configuration with interference between the two upper states .",
