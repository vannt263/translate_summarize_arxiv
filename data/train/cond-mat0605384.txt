    "zitterbewegung ( the trembling motion ) was theoretically devised by schroedinger @xcite after dirac had proposed his equation describing free relativistic electrons in vacuum .",
    "schroedinger showed that , due to a non - commutativity of the quantum velocity @xmath2 with the dirac hamiltonian @xmath3 , relativistic electrons experience the zitterbewegung ( zb ) even in absence of external fields .",
    "the frequency of zb is about @xmath4 and its amplitude is about the compton wavelength @xmath5 .",
    "it was later understood that the phenomenon of zb is due to an interference of electron states with positive electron energies ( @xmath6 ) and those with negative energies ( @xmath7 ) , see @xcite . in other words , the zb results from the structure of the dirac hamiltonian , which contains both positive and negative electron energies , and it is a purely quantum effect as it goes beyond newton s first law .",
    "an important step in the understanding of zb was made by foldy and wouthuysen @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) , who showed that in absence of external fields there exists a unitary transformation that transforms the dirac hamiltonian into a hamiltonian in which positive and negative electron energies are decoupled .",
    "while solutions of the dirac equation are four - component functions , the transformed states for the positive energies have only two upper non - vanishing components and those for the negative energies have only two lower non - vanishing components . now",
    "the above mentioned interference between the positive and negative energy states can not occur and there is no zb . instead ,",
    "in the new representation the electron is not a point - like particle , but it acquires a quantum radius of the size @xmath8 .",
    "the interpretation of the two pictures is until present not quite clear , see @xcite . to our knowledge , the zb for free electrons has never been directly observed .",
    "however , in the presence of the coulomb potential the zb is manifested in appearance of the so called darwin term @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out some time ago that the zitterbewegung also may occur in non - relativistic two - band systems in solids @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , similarly to the relativistic case in vacuum discussed above , the consequence of the zb is that it is impossible to localize the electron better than to a certain finite volume .",
    "recently , an analogy between the dirac description of electrons in vacuum and the coupled - band @xmath9 formalism for electrons in narrow - gap semiconductors ( ngs ) and carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) was used to demonstrate that the zb should occur in these systems @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in agreement with the semi - relativistic analogy @xcite , the zb frequency is always @xmath10 , where @xmath1 is the energy gap between the conduction and valence bands .",
    "the amplitude of zitterbewegung in ngs and cnt was estimated to be @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the effective electron mass and @xmath13cm / s is the maximum electron velocity in the system .",
    "the zb length in ngs and cnt turns out be @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 times larger than in vacuum . a much lower zb frequency and its much higher amplitude , as compared to vacuum ,",
    "should make the zb much more readily observable in semiconductors .",
    "the zitterbewegung was also recently proposed in two - dimensional systems exhibiting spin splitting due to structure and bulk inversion asymmetry @xcite , and in 2d graphite @xcite .",
    "a phenomenon similar to the zb was proposed for electrons in degenerate valence bands in the presence of an external electric field @xcite .",
    "very recently , a unified description of the zitterbewegung of electrons in different solid state systems was attempted @xcite .    in view of this",
    "recently published work we want to investigate the question of whether the phenomenon of zitterbewegung in solids is a rule rather than an exception or _",
    "vice versa_. to this end we consider two limiting models for electrons in solids : nearly - free electrons , for which the periodic potential of the lattice may be treated as a week perturbation , and tightly - bound electrons , for which the periodic potential may not be treated as a perturbation . since we are interested in general properties of the zitterbewegung , we do not insist on details of the band models in question but rather concentrate on essential features that result in this phenomenon .",
    "although we deal with non - relativistic electrons in solids , we use methods of relativistic quantum mechanics to investigate an alternative picture in which the trembling motion is replaced by a kind of electron smearing in real space .",
    "the reason , that a somewhat mysterious phenomenon of zitterbewegung of electrons in vacuum has never been observed , seems to be related to its very high frequency and very small amplitude .",
    "the corresponding phenomenon in solids would have much lower frequency and much larger amplitude .",
    "the underlying hope motivating our work is , that a more thorough theoretical understanding of the trembling motion will lead to an experimental detection of the phenomenon .",
    "this would not only deepen our knowledge of electrons in solids but also represent a great success of the relativistic quantum theory .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we give the basis of nearly - free electron formalism , section iii treats the resulting zitterbewegung using schroedinger s method of the equation of motion . in section",
    "iv a more realistic description of the zb is presented in which electrons are treated as wave packets . in section",
    "v we use the foldy - wouthuysen transformation known from the relativistic quantum mechanics to obtain an alternative electron picture .",
    "section vi treats the zitterbewegung in case of tightly bound electrons . in section vii",
    "we discuss the obtained results and confront them with the previous work .",
    "the paper is concluded by a summary .",
    "the beginning of this section is standard , but it is needed for further developments .",
    "we consider an electron in the presence of an external periodic potential @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a translation vector of the lattice .",
    "the periodic potential @xmath18 may be expressed by the fourier series @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are reciprocal lattice vectors and @xmath21 are fourier components of the periodic potential . for a real potential",
    "there is @xmath22 .",
    "the wave function of an electron has the bloch form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the crystal volume and @xmath25 is the wave vector . inserting the wave function @xmath26 into the schroedinger equation one obtains the well - known equation for the energy @xmath27 and the coefficients @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the free electron mass and @xmath31 are reciprocal lattice vectors .    in absence of the periodic potential there is @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the free electron energy . for a weak periodic potential we may treat @xmath18 as a perturbation and approximate @xmath28 for @xmath35 by retaining only linear terms in @xmath21 .",
    "we obtain then @xmath36 and @xmath33 .",
    "the perturbed energy is @xmath37 for weak potentials the correction to the free electron energy is small .",
    "this , however , is true only if @xmath38 . for @xmath25 and @xmath39 such that @xmath40 we expect @xmath41 to be comparable to @xmath42 and the potential may not be treated as a weak perturbation .",
    "the well known way to treat this problem is to use the approximation for nearly degenerate levels in which we neglect in ( [ eqpertb ] ) all @xmath28 except @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "we then find @xmath43    equations ( [ eq2x2 ] ) are equivalent to dealing with the hamiltonian @xmath44 which is valid for @xmath25 such that @xmath45 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ defhh ] ) has two eigen - energies @xmath46 and two eigen - states @xmath47    where @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    taking only one vector @xmath51 in the reciprocal lattice we are in reality considering a one - dimensional problem . to fix our attention we consider the symmetry of a simple cubic lattice . as to the two points in the reciprocal lattice ,",
    "see ( [ eq2x2 ] ) , it is convenient to take @xmath52 and @xmath53 $ ] , where @xmath54 is the lattice period",
    ". then the two parabolas @xmath55 and @xmath56 in ( [ epertb ] ) cross at @xmath57 $ ] , which determines the brillouin zone boundary on the positive @xmath58 axis , see figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the energy gap at the zone boundary is @xmath59 .",
    "the energies @xmath60 and @xmath61 depend in reality only on @xmath58 .",
    "when using the nearly - degenerate perturbation theory based on ( [ defhh ] ) we should keep in mind that this procedure is only valid near the degeneracy point @xmath62 , but it progressively ceases to work as @xmath58 is lowered toward zero .",
    "we note that @xmath61 of ( [ defed ] ) is analogous to the relativistic dispersion relation @xmath63^{1/2}$ ] .",

    "energy _ versus _ @xmath58 for free and nearly- free electrons ( schematically ) .",

    "the quantum velocity is @xmath77 .",
    "we calculate @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "it follows from ( [ vquant ] ) that the quantum velocity @xmath81 is an operator , not a number .",
    "since @xmath60 depends only on @xmath58 , the only non - vanishing component of @xmath82 is @xmath83 . in the following we drop the index @xmath84 .",
    "eigen - values of the quantum velocity @xmath85 are @xmath86 .",
    "this seems paradoxical , as it means that the quantum velocity takes only two constant ( and extreme ) values .",
    "a similar result is obtained for the dirac equation describing relativistic electrons in vacuum , for which the eigenvalues of the quantum velocity are @xmath87 .",
    "it is known that this feature is related to the phenomenon of zitterbewegung .",
    "it can be easily verified that the quantum velocity ( [ vquant ] ) does not commute with the hamiltonian ( [ defhh ] ) .",
    "this means that @xmath88 does not vanish .",
    "the original derivation of schroedinger s is based on the quantum equation of motion ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us calculate the time dependence of @xmath89 .",
    "we have @xmath90 + [ \\hat{\\bm v}_{\\bm k } , \\hat{h}].\\ ] ] since @xmath75 and @xmath91 are unity matrices , they commute with any number matrices . therefore @xmath92=0 $ ] , so that @xmath93 .",

    "its solution is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a constant operator . inserting ( [ vprim_t ] ) to ( [ vprim2 ] ) @xmath102 solving ( [ eqa0 ] ) for @xmath97",

    "similarly , it follows from ( [ vd_t ] ) and ( [ defa0 ] ) that @xmath109 equals to the @xmath84 component of the initial velocity @xmath82 from ( [ vquant ] ) .    in order to interpret the result ( [ z_t ] ) we observe that the eigen - energy of @xmath74 is @xmath110 , where @xmath61 is given by ( [ defed ] ) .",

    "the last term , according to ( [ exph ] ) , describes oscillations with the frequency @xmath114 .",
    "this frequency corresponds directly to the interband energy @xmath115 , as seen in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "since the hamiltonian @xmath74 is a matrix , the position @xmath116 is also a matrix .",
    "we have explicitly @xmath117 where @xmath118",

    "in agreement with the history of the subject , as described in the introduction , we can legitimately call the above oscillations the zitterbewegung .",
    "we shall discuss the subject of zb more thoroughly below .",
    "here we emphasize how _ little _ we have assumed to obtain the trembling motion - we have only perturbed the free electron motion by a periodic potential .",
    "now we consider a more realistic picture describing an electron in terms of a wave packet .",

    "we can then take various @xmath128 values beginning with @xmath132 at the zone boundary . in figure [ figure2 ]",
    "we show the calculated zb oscillations of @xmath133 for different values of @xmath128 .",
    "it can be seen that , as @xmath128 diminishes from @xmath134 toward the zone center , the amplitude of zb quickly drops .",
    "this should not be surprising since , as is well known ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) , the effect of the periodic potential on the free electron motion is the strongest at the zone boundary @xmath62 , where the minimum gap occurs .",
    "( we do not consider here the gap at @xmath135 for the upper branch ) .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] shows the amplitude of zb for @xmath136 and @xmath137 , as calculated from ( [ pack_z11_t ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath138  is the bohr radius .",
    "for @xmath136 we deal in ( [ defpacket ] ) and ( [ pack_z11_t ] ) with a delta - function and the solid line in figure [ figure3 ] follows the dependence @xmath139 of ( [ z11_t ] ) .",
    "when the width of the wave packet increases ( @xmath127 decreases ) the amplitude of zb for @xmath140 diminishes and , as @xmath128 is lowered , it becomes independent of the width .",
    "since our model is not valid for @xmath128 near zero , we are limited in our considerations to not too small @xmath127 and @xmath128 values .    however , since the zb amplitude diminishes so quickly with diminishing @xmath128 , it is justified to limit the considerations of zb to the vicinity of the band extremes .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ figure2 ] that , with decreasing @xmath128 , the frequency of zb increases .",
    "this increase follows from the behavior of the gap @xmath115 , as illustrated in figure [ figure1 ] .    in order to calculate numerical values of the zb",
    "we need to specify material parameters . as a matter of example",

    "it is given by the velocity multiplied by the charge .",

    "they are quantitatively similar to those shown in figure [ figure2 ] , the zb frequency is clearly the same , the amplitude decreases with increasing @xmath128 .",
    "the phase , however , is different and the velocity @xmath150 is not zero at @xmath106 , but is equal to @xmath152 from ( [ vquant ] ) .",
    "also , the velocity does not oscillate around zero , it oscillates around the value @xmath153 resulting from the second term in ( [ pack_v11_t ] ) . for @xmath132 we can find @xmath153 analytically @xmath154 \\},\\ ] ] where @xmath155 and @xmath156 is the error function . for narrow packets ( large @xmath127 ) the shift @xmath153 tends to zero .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , foldy and wouthuysen @xcite proposed a transformation which , in absence of external fields , transforms the dirac hamiltonian for relativistic electrons in vacuum into a form in which positive and negative electron energies are separated .",
    "it was recently shown by zawadzki @xcite that similar transformations exist for the @xmath157 hamiltonians describing band structures in narrow gap semiconductors and carbon nanotubes .",
    "since also the hamiltonian @xmath74 of ( [ defhd ] ) bears similarity to the dirac hamiltonian , we can expect that a similar transformation exists for nearly - free electrons as well .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "we define a unitary transformation @xmath158 where @xmath159 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath160 .",
    "further @xmath161 and obviously @xmath162 since @xmath75 is proportional to the unity matrix ( see ( [ defhk ] ) ) .",
    "thus , for the transformed hamiltonian the eigen - energy problem factorizes into two independent problems for positive and negative @xmath61 energies .",
    "this means that the wave function corresponding to the positive energy has the lower component equal to zero while the wave function for the negative energy has the upper component equal to zero .",
    "however , this is true also for other wave functions in the transformed representation , as we show below .",
    "we consider an arbitrary wave function @xmath163 in the two - component representation .",
    "it can be expressed in general in the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 let us now transform the above functions using the @xmath166 operator : @xmath167 . after some manipulations we obtain @xmath168 the @xmath169-dependent function under the square root may be put under the integral sign , as explained in @xcite .    the functions @xmath170 have the above mentioned property of having only the upper or the lower non - vanishing components , which is guaranteed by the pre - factors @xmath171 .",
    "using the inverse fourier transform @xmath172 we have @xmath173 where @xmath174 the kernels @xmath175 are not point transformations . to illustrate this we will transform the eigen - function of the position operator @xmath176 in the old representation , i.e. the dirac delta function multiplied by a unit vector @xmath177 the transformed functions are @xmath178 and @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 it is seen explicitly that the transformed functions @xmath182 and @xmath183 have vanishing lower or upper components , respectively . both @xmath184 and @xmath185 are normalized to delta functions . to demonstrate that the transformed functions are characterized by a certain width , we calculate their second moments @xmath186 .",
    "since @xmath187 , where @xmath188 , we have @xmath189 in ( [ defm2 ] ) we used subscripts @xmath169 and @xmath190 to indicate the variables of the integration . using relations @xmath191 and similarly for @xmath190 the triple integral is reduced to @xmath192 where @xmath147 is defined in ( [ deflambdaz ] ) . the above result has been calculated directly using @xmath60 and @xmath61 from ( [ defd ] ) and ( [ defed ] ) .",
    "note that since @xmath193 has the dimension [ m@xmath194 , the dimension of @xmath195 is [ m ] .",
    "similar calculations for the second moment of @xmath196 give @xmath197 . thus the transformed functions for the upper and lower energies are characterized by the same widths , as should be expected .",
    "we will discuss physical implications of the above calculations in section vii .    when transforming various wave functions from the two - component representation to the one - component representation with the use of ( [ defpsipmp ] ) , it is important to know more about the kernels @xmath198 , as given by ( [ defkpm ] ) . as an example we will calculate and plot @xmath193 given by ( [ defkp11 ] )    because both @xmath60 and @xmath61 are centered at @xmath199 , it is convenient to change the variables @xmath200 .",

    "the quantities @xmath205 and @xmath206 are centered at @xmath135 .",
    "after the change of variables , we singled out the rapidly oscillating part of @xmath193 , which is related to the position of bands extremes in the @xmath25 space .",

    "the main result of our work is that both in the case of nearly - free electrons and in the opposite case of tightly bound electrons we predict the zitterbewegung phenomenon . comparing this result with the previous work , in which the zb was predicted with the use of lcao @xcite and @xmath9 theory @xcite ,",
    "we conclude that zb is not due to a particular approach .",
    "in fact , the mathematics is quite similar in all above theories and , although we deal with non- relativistic electrons , it resembles the formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics for free electrons in vacuum .",
    "it is clear that the fundamental underlying reason for the appearance of zb in solids is the periodic potential of the lattice . particularly instructive in this respect are figures [ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] of the present paper which show that the amplitude of zb is directly related to the effect of periodic potential on the free electron motion .",
    "this result is not surprising . without specifying any particular band model we deal in solids with the periodic hamiltonian @xmath288 and",
    "the electron velocity is @xmath289 .",
    "it follows that @xmath290\\neq 0 $ ] , i.e. the velocity is not constant in time because of the periodic potential @xmath18 . in this perspective the various models mentioned above simply illustrate how this result comes about .    clearly , the velocity does not commute with the hamiltonian in the presence of other potentials as well",
    ". however the periodic potential is special because , due to the bloch theorem , the electrons can propagate in the perfect crystal without scattering and the quasi - momentum @xmath291 is a good quantum number .",
    "for this reason it is possible to treat the electrons as almost free particles and replace the influence of the periodic potential by an effective electron mass .",
    "still , as demonstrated in refs . @xcite and the present paper , within two - band models the basic non - commutativity of @xmath292 and @xmath293 mentioned above remains in the form of non - commuting @xmath235 matrices with the resulting zitterbewegung . if the bands are completely separated , we have @xmath294 and @xmath295 , so that @xmath296 and @xmath292 commute and the zb disappears . however , there is a price to pay for this separation .",
    "it is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and in the present paper that , once the electrons are described by a one - band equation ( so that their energy is completely specified ) , they should be treated as objects of a finite size .",
    "the last effect is observable in the presence of an external potential due to appearance of the so called darwin term for free relativistic electrons @xcite as well as semiconductor electrons @xcite .    as emphasized throughout our paper",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , in the two - band model the zb of non - relativistic electrons in solids is in close analogy to the zb of relativistic electrons in vacuum , as first proposed by schroedinger .",
    "the hamiltonians for the two cases are very similar and in both systems the zb results from an interference of electron states corresponding to positive and negative electron energies @xcite .",
    "if , with the use of foldy - wouthuysen transformation , the states of positive and negative energies are separated in the hamiltonian and in the wave functions , the zb does not occur because the positive energy state ( say ) has nothing to interfere with .",
    "this corresponds to the separation of bands mentioned above and the conclusions of the two reasonings agree .",
    "thus we are confronted with the following choice : 1 ) we use a two- band description , the electrons are point - like particles and they experience the zitterbewegung .",
    "2 ) we use a one - band description , the electrons do not experience the zitterbewegung but they are characterized by a quantum radius of the size equal to the zb amplitude .    the last point is illustrated by ( [ defs2 ] ) describing the average smearing of the transformed delta function .",
    "it is equal to the amplitude of zb given by ( [ z11_t ] ) .",
    "one can say that the separation of energy bands by the foldy - wouthuysen transformation is equivalent to a certain averaging of the zb motion .",
    "it was observed @xcite that , since the zitterbewegung had been predicted for plane dirac waves , it is not quite clear what the trembling motion means for an electron uniformly distributed in space . in this connection",
    "it is important that the amplitude does not vary much when the electron is represented by a wave packet localized in real space , see figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "passing to more specific points of our treatment , we emphasize again how little we had to assume to derive the zb in case of nearly - free electrons - it was enough to perturb the free electron motion by a periodic potential .",
    "this case has certain particularities . in the typical two - band situations , both in vacuum @xcite and in solids @xcite",
    ", there exists a maximum velocity in the system which plays an important role in the theory . in case of nearly - free electrons",
    "there is no maximum velocity since the perturbed energy branches tend asymptotically to the free electron parabola @xmath297 , see figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "this is reflected in the velocity @xmath298 , while the velocity @xmath97 has the typical two - band behavior and it is responsible for the zb .",
    "in fact , the velocity @xmath97 has the maximum value .",
    "it is equal to @xmath299 , see our eigen - value considerations after ( [ vquant ] ) . for @xmath142",
    "the maximum velocity is 6.4@xmath300cm / s , which should be compared with @xmath301cm / s obtained from the @xmath9 theory for gaas and other iii - v compounds @xcite .",
    "again , our simple model gives quite a reasonable estimation .",
    "in the nearly - free electrons model @xmath147 is proportional to @xmath302 ( see ( [ deflambdaz ] ) ) , which agrees with the @xmath9 approach @xcite , where @xmath303 . in narrow gap materials @xmath147",
    "can be as large as tens of angstroms .",
    "as far as the phenomenon of zb is concerned , the behavior of nearly - free and tightly bound electrons is quite similar .",
    "the main difference comes from the fact that in nearly - free case the fourier coefficients of the periodic potential do not depend on the wave vector @xmath25 , whereas in the tightly bound case they go to zero for vanishing @xmath281 . as a result , in the first case ( see figure [ figure3 ] ) the zb amplitude is highest for the @xmath128 corresponding to the minimum energy gap , while in the second case ( see figure [ figure6 ] ) the maximum amplitude is shifted with respect to the minimum gap . for the tightly bound case the electrons in @xmath304 bands ( see ( [ deft3 ] ) ) would not exhibit the zb , but we do not insist on this point since these two bands are not realistically described by the model .    in order to illustrate that , after the foldy - wouthuysen transformation is carried out , the former dirac delta function is smeared into the kernel @xmath305 of ( [ defkp11 ] ) , we not only calculate it numerically ( see figure [ figure5 ] ) , but also calculate its second moment @xmath306 ( see ( [ wynm2 ] ) ) and the sum rule @xmath307 of ( [ defs2 ] ) .",
    "the second moment has the advantage of using the standard quantum mechanical probability distribution @xmath308 , see ( [ defm2 ] ) .",
    "its disadvantage is that this probability distribution is normalized to the dirac delta function and not to a number . as to the sum rules using the single @xmath229 function",
    ", their advantage is that both the normalization ( [ defs0 ] ) and the sum rule @xmath309 ( [ defs2 ] ) are numbers , and ( [ defs2 ] ) can be simply interpreted as a square of smearing ( this procedure was used for free relativistic electrons by rose @xcite ) .",
    "the disadvantage of using the single @xmath229 is that we have to separate out its smooth part , see ( [ defsmooth ] ) .",
    "the oscillatory part @xmath310 would not appear if we considered the nearly - free electron gap at @xmath135 .    methods to observe the zitterbewegung should clearly be adjusted to the investigated materials , but it seems that an appropriate tool would be the scanning probe microscopy which can produce images of coherent electron flow @xcite .",
    "this technique uses a sharp mobile tip which can sense the electron charge .",
    "if one used dilute magnetic semiconductors of cdmnte type @xcite , one could employ magnetic effects caused by electron oscillations .",
    "the second category of possible observable effects is related to the problem of what happens when electrons are confined to dimensions smaller than @xmath147 . in relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "one finds statements that a measurement of the position of a particle , if carried out with greater precision than the compton wavelength , would lead to pair production @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that the pairs created this way can only be virtual , otherwise their recombination would lead to the production of energy out of nothing . the virtual carriers could be observed in screening or in magnetism .",
    "an alternative point of view states that a stiff confinement is equivalent to an infinite potential well having the width @xmath311 , and the electrons will simply occupy the lowest energy level in such a well .",
    "it is , however , certain that if an electron is confined to dimensions @xmath311 , its energy ( or its uncertainty ) is of the order of the gap @xmath1 between the positive and negative electron energies , which means that the one - band description is not adequate .",
    "we are then back to the two - band model , which was our starting point .",
    "there remain many unanswered questions concerning the trembling motion but it appears that in crystalline solids it represents a rule rather than an exception . according to the theory , the zb in semiconductors has decisive advantages over the corresponding effect in vacuum .",
    "thus an experimental detection of the trembling motion in solids appears to be a matter of near future .",
    "we considered theoretically non - relativistic nearly - free electrons in solids for which the periodic potential of the lattice may be treated as a weak perturbation on the free electron motion . using the two - band model we showed that electrons experience the trembling motion ( zitterbewegung ) in absence of external fields , similar to that for free relativistic electrons in vacuum .",
    "the frequency of zb and its amplitude were derived .",
    "the frequency is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy gap between the two bands .",
    "the amplitude @xmath147 depends on the strength of periodic potential and the lattice period . for typical parameters",
    "@xmath147 can be of the order of 10  to 100  that is @xmath312 times larger than in vacuum .",
    "the trembling motion is also considered for nearly - free electrons represented by wave packets , it is shown that the amplitude is not strongly dependent on packet s width .",
    "the foldy - wouthuysen type of unitary transformation , known from relativistic quantum mechanics , is used to separate the energy bands .",
    "consequences of the fw transformation are investigated .",
    "it is demonstrated that , if one uses a one - band description , the electrons do not experience the trembling motion but they should be treated as particles having size @xmath147 . tightly bound electrons are considered as well to provide an opposite case to nearly - free electrons . within the two - band model the trembling motion is obtained also in this case demonstrating that the zb phenomenon is not related to a specific theoretical approach .",
    "it is concluded that the trembling motion is directly related to the effect of the periodic potential on the electron and , as such , it should occur in many situations in solids .",
    "this work was supported in part by the polish ministry of sciences , grant no pbz - min-008/p03/2003 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    first , we prove some properties of @xmath74 of ( [ defhd ] ) .",
