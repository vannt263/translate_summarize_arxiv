    "in particular , this spacing should be comparable to @xmath11 in the bulk region @xmath41 ( for any fixed @xmath42 ) , and as large as @xmath43 at the edge of the spectrum .",

    "this result was established via a strong bound on the convergence of the stieltjes transform , which in turn was obtained by a lengthy moment method computation .",
    "our first main result gives an alternate method to establish eigenvalue localisation , based on the _ three moment theorem _ rather than on combining the stieltjes transform method with the moment method , and which gives a non - averaged version ( in the case when the third moment vanishes ) :    [ stronglocal ] there is an absolute constant @xmath7 such that the following holds for any constant @xmath8 .",

    "next , we give an application of theorem [ stronglocal ] to demonstrate the sharpness ( in some sense ) of the _ four moment theorem _ , introduced by the authors in @xcite in order to study the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices .",

    "* theorem 15 ) ( which handled the bulk case when @xmath54 ) and ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.13 ) ( which handled the edge case ) .",
    "these theorems can also handle the joint distribution of several eigenvalues at once , as well as somewhat more general ensembles than those in definition [ herm - def ] , but we will not discuss these generalisations here .",
    "we will refer to the second part of theorem [ theorem : main2 ] as the _ three moment theorem_.    roughly speaking , theorem [ theorem : main2 ] asserts that the distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath96 differ by @xmath97 for some @xmath7 if the atom distributions have matching moments to order @xmath92 , and by @xmath98 for any @xmath7 if the atom distributions only have matching moments to order @xmath91 .",
    "for instance , for sufficiently large @xmath28 one has @xmath99 for some @xmath7 if one has matching moments to order @xmath92 , and @xmath100 for all @xmath7 ( with @xmath28 sufficiently large depending on @xmath61 ) if one has matching moments to order @xmath91 . morally speaking",
    ", this means that the medians @xmath101 of @xmath102 , @xmath103 differ by @xmath97 when there are four matching moments and by @xmath98 when there are three matching moments , although this is not quite rigorous due to the presence of the @xmath104 error in the above bounds .",
    "( for some rigorous bounds on the median of @xmath102 , see section [ local - proof ] . )",
    "the matching moment conditions are essential to the method of proof of theorem [ theorem : main2 ] , which uses a taylor expansion argument .",

    "@xmath105-point correlation functions _ of these eigenvalues , then in the asymptotic limit @xmath38 ( and with appropriate normalisations ) , these correlation functions have a universal distribution regardless of how many matching moments there are ; see @xcite ( with earlier partial results in this direction in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is not hard to see that the universality for the limiting distributions ( or joint distributions ) of individual eigenvalues imply the universality of the @xmath105-point correlation function .",
    "our second main result below is evidence that the four moment hypothesis is indeed necessary if one wishes to control individual eigenvalues at the scale of the eigenvalue spacing .",

    "in particular ( by the pigeonhole principle ) , there exists @xmath18 such that @xmath111 where @xmath112 depends only on the atom distributions .",
    "theorem [ theorem : main ] is not exactly comparable to the four moment theorem , as it pertains to the _ mean _ of the eigenvalues @xmath102 , whereas the four moment theorem instead controls quantities such as the _ median_. however , it is expected that the mean and median of @xmath102 should be quite close ( in particular , closer than the expected eigenvalue spacing ) , but the best known concentration results for @xmath102 ( such as theorem [ stronglocal ] ) are not strong enough to establish this yet .",
    "if one assumes that the mean and median are sufficiently close , then theorem [ theorem : main ] is strong evidence that the four moment theorem breaks down if one only assumes three matching moments .",
    "the three moment theorem implies ( roughly speaking ) that the medians of @xmath113 should only differ by @xmath114 , for arbitrarily small @xmath115 . in view of this , one expects the index @xmath63 provided by theorem [ theorem : main ] to lie in the bulk region @xmath54 , and indeed the conclusion theorem [ theorem : main ] should in fact hold for _ most _ @xmath63 in this bulk region .",
    "however , we were unable to demonstrate this",
    ". nevertheless , concentration bounds such as those given earlier in this section should be able to establish some non - trivial lower bound on @xmath116 .",
    "the question that how each particular eigenvalue reacts to a change in the fourth moment looks very interesting . by utilising higher moments and making some heuristic arguments",

    "we ran a numerical test to check the conjecture .",

    "the summand @xmath268 is then equal to @xmath269 , and similarly @xmath270 is then equal to @xmath271 .",
    "we now assign each @xmath266 a label @xmath272 from @xmath27 to @xmath265 by order of appearance ; thus @xmath273 will be assigned a label @xmath274 of @xmath27 , the first @xmath266 that is distinct from @xmath273 will be assigned a label of @xmath275 , the first @xmath266 has not already been labeled @xmath27 or @xmath276 will be labeled @xmath91 , and so forth .",
    "the closed path @xmath277 then traverses a tree @xmath278 of @xmath262 edges spanning the vertices @xmath279 , where the path @xmath280 traverses each edge of @xmath278 with multiplicity two , with the exception of one edge of @xmath278 that is traversed four times .",

    "it is not hard to see that each such @xmath92-admissible path contributes @xmath283 to @xmath284 , and similarly contributes @xmath285 to @xmath259 .",
    "subtracting , we see that each @xmath280 contributes @xmath286 to @xmath261 . thus , it will suffice to show that for any @xmath287 , the number of @xmath92-admissible paths on trees of @xmath287 edges is equal to @xmath253 .    the claim is trivial unless @xmath287 is a positive integer .",
    "we observe the recurrence @xmath288 for @xmath255 , where @xmath289 are the catalan numbers , thus @xmath290 indeed , writing @xmath291 and @xmath292 a brief calculation shows that @xmath293 whence the claim .",

    "it is a classical fact that the number of @xmath276-admissible paths is @xmath296 .",

    "we now repeat the arguments from the previous section . a routine generalisation of proposition [ fourthconc ] yields the bound @xmath308 for any @xmath309 and some absolute constant @xmath7 ( note that the left - hand side vanishes for @xmath310 ) .",
    "we conclude from this and lemma [ higher ] that @xmath311    next , we observe from that @xmath312 for @xmath313 near infinity , where we pick the branch of the square root of @xmath314 that equals @xmath313 near infinity and is analytic away from the interval @xmath176 $ ] . then the right - hand side continues analytically to the exterior of this interval . calling this analytic function @xmath315 ,",

    "in particular , we are led to the conjecture ( conjecture [ conj - asym ] ) that @xmath330 and this in turn suggests the following asymptotic for the expected value of @xmath102 :    [ conj - asym ] for @xmath41 with @xmath42 fixed , one has @xmath117 for some absolute constant @xmath7 , where @xmath118 is some bounded quantity depending only on @xmath119 ( and is in particular independent of @xmath17 ) .",
