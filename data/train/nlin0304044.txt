    "nonlinear dynamical methods for analyzing a discrete - time series and for determining order - chaos transition in a dynamical system have been widely used .",
    "but it is recognized by several authors that nonlinear dynamical methods used imply a high computational cost . in this sense , therefore , any method that allows to obtain some information about the behavior of a dynamical system and that can operate over a relatively shorter discrete - time series , acquires an important practical value . for complementing those methods of nonlinear dynamical analysis we shall now consider to demonstrate that introducing the concept of the inverse average magnitude - squared coherence index is possible to quantify the order - chaos transition in a system governed by the hnon mapping dynamics .",
    "it is very important when dealing with a chaotic system keeping in mind that local sensitivity to a small error is the hallmark of such a system . a dynamical system such those that are described by the hnon mapping dynamics produces a discrete - time non - chaotic series when the control parameter @xmath2 value satisfies the condition @xmath3 . for such a condition",
    "a discrete - time series generated by the recursive process does not almost change if the initial condition is modified and there exists phase consistency between the two discrete - time series at a given frequency .",
    "however , when the control parameter value is greater than 1.0532 , a discrete - time series generated by the hnon mapping does meaningfully change if the initial condition is slightly modified and phase consistency between the two discrete - time series at a given frequency , in general , must be lost@xcite .",
    "this effect may be quantified by applying an inverse average magnitude - squared coherence index@xcite .",
    "the magnitude - squared coherence has been used by several authors for measuring phase constancy between two or more signals at one frequency@xcite in former works@xcite the dft representation for qualitatively describing the order - chaos transition in a dynamical system is used . by introducing an inverse average magnitude - squared coherence index ( iamsci ) the order - chaos transition in a dynamical system described by the logistic equation was quantitatively determined@xcite .",
    "now we intended , following this idea , to make the description of order - chaos transition in a dynamical system governed by the hnon mapping dynamics by applying the welch average periodogram method for calculating the power spectral density and from this , to introduce the inverse average magnitude - squared coherence index for indicating quantitatively order - chaos transition in the dynamical system indicated .",
    "the fundamental advantage of this method upon the others is that it can operate on a relatively shorter discrete - time series . by estimating the largest lyapounov exponent was able to evaluate those results obtained here applying an inverse average magnitude squared coherence index , defined by averaging @xmath4 estimate over all the frequency .",
    "the hnon mapping can be formulated as given by    @xmath5=1.0-a*x[n]^2+b*y[n],\\\\ y[n+1]=b*x[n]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where b=0.3 , and a is an adjustable control parameter . with the initial condition ( x[1],y[1 ] ) specified , a discrete - time series with a given length by a recursive action",
    "is obtained , each time .",
    "the nature of the behavior of a data sequence obtained can be modified by chosen conveniently a value of the control parameter a. the interval [ 0.2,1.4 ] was chosen , and a set of evenly spaced values of a with a step @xmath6=0.01 was considered to obtain a family consisting of 120 discrete - time series , each of them containing @xmath7 samples .",
    "the plot of the histogram for each discrete - time series allows to have immediately a simple statistical characterization of the discrete - time series . in order to make easier further computations ,",
    "data points were organized into a rectangular matrix containing 120 columns , being each of them a discrete - time series with the length @xmath8 data points .      a system containing one or more positive exponents is to be defined as chaotic . for calculating the lyapounov exponents spectrum",
    "some algorithms have been developed .",
    "one of the most used algorithm is that reported by wolf et al@xcite . from the exponents spectrum ,",
    "the largest exponent , @xmath10 , decides the behavior of the dynamical system . for calculating the largest exponent",
    ", one can also refer the algorithm proposed by rosenstein et al@xcite .",
    "details of these algorithms can be found in refereed papers .",
    "the largest lyapounov exponent,@xmath9 , for each time series in the set was determined using a professional software@xcite .",
    "the selection of the time delay , @xmath11 , and the embedding dimension , @xmath12 , required for reconstructing the phase space is part of the problem .",
    "the value @xmath11=1 was chosen considering the optimal filling of the phase space method@xcite . for embedding dimension the value @xmath12=3",
    "was chosen .",
    "it is highly meaningful when dealing with a chaotic system keeping in mind that local sensitivity to a small error is the hallmark of such a system . a dynamical system as the one described by the logistic equation produces a discrete - time non - chaotic series when the control parameter @xmath2 value satisfies the condition @xmath3 . for such a condition",

    "figure 5 depicts the results of plotting the inverse average magnitude - squared coherence ( 1/@xmath34\\rangle$ ] ) , calculated for each time series in the set , as a function of the control parameter @xmath2 . and figure 6 depicts the results of plotting the inverse average magnitude - squared coherence index , @xmath33 , in decibels , calculated for each time series in the set , as a function of the control parameter @xmath2 too .",

    "this reference serves as a control plot for the discussion of the results obtained by applying the inverse average magnitude - squared coherence index method .",
    "the application of the dft representation of a chaotic - type signal gives satisfactory results for determining the order - chaos transition in a system described by the hnon mapping dynamics@xcite .",
    "a critical value for control parameter @xmath2 is reported in literature beyond which a sequence produced by the hnon mapping exhibits a chaotic behavior .",
    "this threshold value approaches @xmath35 . on the other hand , figures from 1 to 4",
    "show the time domain representation of some of the time series and their corresponding magnitude - squared coherence spectrum . comparing figures 1 ( @xmath36 ) with 2 ( @xmath36 ) , 3 ( @xmath36 ) , and 4 ( @xmath36 )",
    ", it can be deduced the bifurcation effect and the transition to chaos .",
    "note that in figures 2 , 3 and 4 the control parameter satisfies the condition @xmath37 , and it corresponds to a value for a positive largest lyapounov exponent , as it can be estimated from figure 7 .",
    "it may be observe in those cases that the magnitude - squared coherence spectrum exhibits values far away from one for several values of the frequency in the @xmath4 spectrum .",
    "it makes the average magnitude - squared coherence to be less than one , corresponding to a situation for which the discrete - time series becomes incoherent indicating in this case a chaotic behavior of the dynamical system .",

    "is recommended for quantitatively detecting the order - chaos transition , and this can be added to the metric tools of the nonlinear dynamical analysis for complementing the research of a discrete - time series .",
    "the application of the inverse average magnitude - squared coherence index ( iamsci ) , @xmath33 , to a discrete - time series obtained from the hnon mapping can be done on a chaotic discrete - time series .",
    "this discrete - time series has the property that exhibits a high level of coherence lost , and it can be detected by applying the iamsci method .",
    "this method does not exert a strong requirement on the length of the experimental data sequence .",
    "if one deals with a nonlinear dynamical system which can modify its behavior between order and chaos , a discrete - time series produced by that system reflects this change , and the iamsci method applying to the discrete - time series allow to determine this change .",
