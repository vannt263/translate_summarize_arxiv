    "although star 1 appears to be indistinguishable from the surrounding diffuse emission in figure  [ fig : overbw ] , this is only due to the scale used to display the image . to measure the flux of the star",

    "the models by @xcite suggest that these colors are consistent with those of a late class 0 source .      to understand the nature of the cb@xmath10  24  @xmath0 shadow",
    "one must measure its physical properties , such as mass and size ; to do so one needs an accurate distance .",
    "while star counts are commonly used to estimate distances to nearby clouds , in the case of cb@xmath10  this method is not reliable due to the small number of foreground sources .",

    "these distance estimates are highly speculative , as the uncertainty in the magnitudes makes the observed colors marginally consistent with later - type models .",
    "furthermore , these models are relatively untested .    in this context , i.e. , determining a distance to cb@xmath10 , source 1 ( see fig .  [",

    "we have used the irac and 2mass data to probe the extinction law in cb@xmath10 .",
    "these data are used to generate the color - color plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : irac2 ] .",
    "we calculate the errors in these colors by adding the respective irac and 2mass k - band errors in quadrature ; the median values of these errors are plotted in the lower right corner of fig .",

    "[ fig : irac2 ] as a solid black line . because this slope agrees reasonably well with the @xcite extinction vectors , we conclude that the dust found in cb@xmath10  is not anomalous and that we are justified in using a `` standard '' reddening law to determine the dust properties in this globule .",
    "the agreement with the @xcite extinction is not surprising because , as was shown in @xcite and @xcite , there is generically almost no difference in the infrared extinction in dense clouds even though the visual bands may deviate significantly from their low - density values .",
    "we note that we exclude source 2 , discussed in   3.1 , from this analysis for two reasons : first , because it has a very large 24  @xmath0 excess , and second , because its broad - band sed is consistent with the colors of a proto - star , being too red to be simply due to a foreground dust screen and a normal star ( see fig .

    "while it is possible that the emission varies on shorter scales and , more specifically , emission from cb@xmath10  fills in the 24  @xmath0 shadow , we consider this to be unlikely due to the fact that the shadow is not detected at 70  @xmath0 .",
    "it is not plausible that cb@xmath10  would be emitting significantly at 24  @xmath0 while remaining undetected at the longer wavelength . in the following discussion",
    "we describe the method used to derive the optical depth and extinction profile for the 24  @xmath0 shadow .",
    "first , we estimate the overall large - scale uniform background level in the image , @xmath104 .",
    "we do so using two dark regions in the image , free from sources , indicated by boxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : mips ] , one to the north - east and one to the south - west of the shadow , each one about 50@xmath37 on a side .",
    "we use the first percentile flux value in these boxes , @xmath105  mjy  arcsec@xmath106 , as a lower limit on the overall uniform level in the image .",
    "we use this background level to set the true image zero level by subtracting it from the original image .",
    "then we mask out all bright sources in the image by clipping all pixels with values @xmath71 above the mean .",
    "finally , we use this background - subtracted and bright - source masked image to derive an optical - depth and extinction profile . for completeness",
    ", we estimate the error in @xmath104 by simulating the pixel distribution in the two dark regions .",
    "we estimate @xmath107 by simulating @xmath108 pixel values drawn from a normal density with mean and standard deviation equal to those measured in the two regions and storing the first percentile pixel value .",
    "we repeat @xmath109 times , and calculate the standard deviation in the simulated @xmath104 of @xmath110  mjy  arcsec@xmath106 .",
    "we proceed by dividing the shadow into regions of nested ( concentric and adjacent ) annuli @xmath111 in width , the inner - most region being a circle with a radius of @xmath111 .",
    "these regions are centered on the darkest part of the shadow , which is also roughly coincident with the peak in the @xmath6co emission .",
    "we measure the average flux per pixel in each region out to a radius of @xmath112 , chosen to be big enough to allow for a reasonable estimate of the background immediately adjacent to the shadow .",
    "we show the derived radial profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] . based on this profile",
    ", we set the boundary of the shadow to be at a radius of @xmath113 ( marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] with a solid line ) where there is a flattening in the derived profile .",
    "we estimate the background flux by averaging the values of the annuli outside @xmath1 and within @xmath114 .",
    "this background value is marked in figure  [ fig : cont ] with a dashed line .",
    "we use this profile to calculate the optical depth @xmath115 of the shadow . in a given annulus @xmath115",
    "is given by @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the background level and @xmath118 is the shadow flux .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath115 varies from @xmath119 at the center to about 0.02 at a radius of @xmath113 . the average mass column density in each annulus is then given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the gas - to - dust ratio , and @xmath122 is the absorption cross - section per mass of dust .",
    "in this work we use the value of @xmath123  @xmath124  gm@xmath36 calculated by @xcite from his @xmath125 model .",
    "the choice of a model with a high @xmath126 value relative to the diffuse ism is intended to account for some of the grain - growth effects likely to be taking place in cb@xmath10 , as evidenced by the depletion indicated by our @xmath5co and @xmath6co data .",
    "this column density profile can be converted to an extinction profile using the relation @xmath127a@xmath128  atoms  @xmath51  mag@xmath36 @xcite , where we assume that all of the hydrogen is in molecular form .",
    "we use a value of @xmath129 , appropriate for the diffuse ism where this relation was measured , to convert from @xmath130 to @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding extinction is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the effective molecular weight per hydrogen molecule .",
    "the molecular weight per hydrogen molecule is related to the mass fraction of hydrogen , @xmath133 ( where @xmath134 ) , by @xmath135 for a cosmic hydrogen mass fraction @xmath136 , @xmath137 ( jens kauffmann - private communication , 2006 ) .",
    "we consider two sources of uncertainty in the column density profile for the 24  @xmath0 shadow : the dc - background error and the uncertainty in our assumed dust model , @xmath122 .",
    "we measure an error in the dc - background level of @xmath138  mjy  arcsec@xmath106 ( described above ) .",
    "we then calculate the corresponding uncertainty in a@xmath97 by propagating @xmath107 through the equation for @xmath115 and scaling appropriately .",
    "we estimate the dust model uncertainty to be half of the difference in @xmath122 between the @xcite @xmath129 model and the @xmath125 model . to obtain an estimate of the total uncertainty in @xmath57 ,",
    "we add these two components and a @xmath139 systematic error floor in quadrature .",
    "the column density profile and corresponding errors are shown in figure  [ fig : av ] along with individual 2mass point - source extinction estimates .",
    "we use 2mass sources with data quality flags better than , and including , `` ubb '' , and include `` c '' quality measurements in a bandpass when the other two filters are `` b '' quality or better . sources with upper limits in two or more bands are rejected .",
    "this selection ensures that we include the maximum number of quality extinction measurements while not biasing the object selection towards stars with lower amounts of reddening .",
    "the reddening of the accepted sources is measured using the @xmath140 color and the @xcite extinction law : @xmath141 .",
    "the `` intrinsic '' @xmath142 color of the stars is measured in the 70@xmath37 to 100  @xmath37 annulus centered on the shadow , to isolate the effects of the globule from that of nearby diffuse dust .",
    "we reject sources between 0@xmath37 and 70@xmath37 with @xmath143 values lower than @xmath144 , the 1-@xmath67 value for the scatter in the sources between 70@xmath37 and 100@xmath37 .",
    "this 1-@xmath67 range is marked in figure  [ fig : av ] with two dotted lines .",
    "two sources fulfill this criterion , located at r @xmath145 from the center .",
    "we reject one other source with an a@xmath146 located at @xmath147 on the basis that it is likely to be a foreground object .",
    "we calculate a probability of 1.4% of finding three foreground stars , using the stellar number densities from the nearby stars database ( nstars ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is not surprising that this probability is so low because the nstars catalog is not complete .",
    "a more accurate estimate of the likelihood of finding three foreground stars within the shadow is determined as follows . in the 70@xmath37 to 100  @xmath37 annulus there are three stars with upper limits below a@xmath148 and two stars with a@xmath149 .",
    "furthermore , the 70@xmath37 shadow and the surrounding 70@xmath37 to 100  @xmath37 annulus have the same area .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath150 foreground stars in the shadow region , and hence rejecting three stars is reasonable . using the remaining stars we calculate the best - fit gaussian parameters for the distribution of @xmath57 values in two annuli , from 0  @xmath37 to 40  @xmath37 and from 40  @xmath37 to 70@xmath37 .",
    "lower limits are not treated differently than proper detections in our fitting procedure . therefore , when we plot the mean values from these fits versus average radius the values are shown as lower limits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : av ] ) .",
    "the trend of increasing column , or a@xmath97 , with decreasing radius can be seen clearly .    in this section",
    "we have presented a new technique for analyzing 24  @xmath0 shadows which allows for a smooth estimate of the density profile of these cold cloud cores at a 6@xmath37 resolution .",
    "most importantly , this method traces gas and dust down to the densest regions in the cloud .",
    "in the following mass estimates we assume a distance to cb@xmath10  of 400  pc ( cf .   3.2 ) .",
    "we present a summary of these calculations in table  1 .",
    "we use the optical depth profile derived in   3.4 to calculate the mass of the 24  @xmath0 shadow .",
    "the dust mass in a given annulus is @xmath151 where @xmath115 is the optical depth in the annulus , @xmath122 is the absorption cross section per mass of dust at @xmath152 , @xmath153 is the solid angle subtended by a pixel , @xmath154 is the number of pixels in the annulus and @xmath155 is the distance to the cloud .",
    "using the @xmath122 from the @xcite milky way synthetic extinction curve model with @xmath125 , a gas - to - dust ratio @xmath156 , and summing over all the annuli within 70@xmath37 , we derive a total 24  @xmath0 shadow mass of @xmath157 ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : av ] ) . using equation 4 and standard propagation of errors",
    "we find that the fractional error in the mass is equal to 3.3 times the fractional error in the local background flux level , @xmath117 ( marked as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] ) . for a fractional error in the background level of @xmath158 , corresponding to the the @xmath159 confidence interval for the distribution plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] , we calculate a @xmath160 error in the mass . we note that this error analysis does not include other significant systematic sources of error , like differences in calculated dust opacities .",
    "for example , @xcite calculate a 24  @xmath0 @xmath122 = @xmath161  @xmath124  gm@xmath36 ( for the thin ice mantle model generated at a density of @xmath162  @xmath163 ) , a factor @xmath164 1.6 greater than the @xcite opacities used here , which would reduce our mass to @xmath165 .",
    "we adopt a mass of @xmath166 , although the estimates from the 160  @xmath0 data imply this value may be a lower limit .",
    "this mass is @xmath3 times bigger than the mass derived from the co observations ( see   5.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , for a spherical cloud of the same size and mass as cb@xmath10 , and a temperature of 10  k ( consistent with both the co line data and the far infrared to submillimeter continuum fit ) we derive a jeans mass @xmath167 . while such a low mass would imply instability to collapse if we only consider thermal pressure , this analysis neglects alternate forms of support  namely turbulence and magnetic fields  which likely play a significant role in cb@xmath10 .      assuming that the dust is optically thin , the dust mass associated with the 160  @xmath0 emission is given by @xmath168 where d is the distance to the cloud and @xmath169 is the absorption cross section per mass of dust at @xmath170 .",
    "we use a value for @xmath171  @xmath124  gm@xmath36 , given by the @xcite model with thin ice mantles and generated at a density of @xmath162  @xmath163 .",
    "these models account for grain growth effects , which are likely to be taking place inside the cold , dense cloud environment .",
    "these authors show that the effects of grain growth on the opacities are , however , minor . to calculate the dust mass we integrate the 160  @xmath0 flux within a 6.25  pixel ( @xmath114 ) radius aperture centered on the 24  @xmath0 shadow ( and the peak @xmath6co emission ) and subtract an estimated pixel background level .",
    "we estimate this background per pixel by averaging the flux in an annulus with an inner radius of 20  pixels and a width of 4 pixels .",
    "we assume a gas - to - dust ratio @xmath172 .",
    "a typical temperature for dust grains heated by the interstellar radiation field ( irf ) is @xmath173  k @xcite ; if the cloud is externally heated by the irf then the total mass , given by equation 4 , is @xmath174 .",
    "however , we have shown in   2.5 that the temperature of the cloud is in the range of 10.4k to 12k , giving a total mass estimate between @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the @xcite models also include opacities for grains with thick ice mantles ; this opacity would scale these masses down by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "we note that the @xcite @xmath125 ism opacity of @xmath177  @xmath124  gm@xmath36 yields masses that are larger by a factor of 4 .",
    "however , these models do not take into account the grain growth effects that are thought to occur in cold , dense regions .",
    "we note that the temperature of cb190 is not likely be constant throughout the cloud but instead probably decreases inwards ; this gradient would bias the 160@xmath0 observations toward hotter dust on the outside of the globule and hence we might underestimate the mass .",
    "we use observations of @xmath5co and @xmath6co @xmath178 to estimate a mass for cb@xmath10 .",
    "we use the @xmath5co data to estimate an excitation temperature in the cloud ; this temperature is then used in conjunction with the @xmath6co data to estimate a mass , using standard assumptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we derive a @xmath5co gas temperature @xmath3  k. for an isotope ratio of [ @xmath5co/@xmath6co ] = 50 and a standard non - depleted ratio of @xmath179 @xcite we derive a cloud mass @xmath180 by summing over the entire @xmath181 by @xmath182 area of the image . for an aperture with a radius of 70@xmath183 centered on the peak of the @xmath6co emission ( and the 24@xmath0 shadow ) we derive a total gas mass of @xmath184 .",
    "this co mass is much less than the @xmath185 derived from the 24@xmath0 shadow profile ( cf .  ",
    "these contradictory mass measurements can be reconciled if freezeout is an important effect , which we consider to be a likely scenario , or if the @xmath186 ratio is over - estimated by about an order of magnitude .",
    "we note that masses derived in this fashion will simply scale with the isotope ratio .",
    "for comparison we calculate the virial mass of the globule . using our higher resolution data we measure the fwhm of the @xmath6co line to be @xmath187  km  s@xmath36 at the location of the shadow .",
    "however , the c@xmath16o data suggests that there may be two velocity components broadening the @xmath6co line .",
    "the line width of the c@xmath16o observation is roughly @xmath188  km  s@xmath36 at fwhm , in agreement with the nh@xmath14 linewidth .",
    "however , like the @xmath6co line , it appears to have some asymmetry on the red side ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hr12 ] ) .",
    "if we estimate the total width of the line by doubling the hwhm from the blue side , then we obtain a @xmath189  km  s@xmath36 .",
    "we take 0.5  km  s@xmath36 as an upper limit on the line width and 0.2  km  s@xmath36 as a more plausible value .",

    "<S> we present _ spitzer _ observations of the dark globule cb190 ( l771 ) . we observe a roughly circular 24@xmath0 shadow with a @xmath1 radius . </S>",
    "<S> the extinction profile of this shadow matches the profile derived from 2mass photometry at the outer edges of the globule and reaches a maximum of @xmath2 visual magnitudes at the center . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding mass of cb190 is @xmath3  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath5co and @xmath6co j = 2 - 1 data over a 10@xmath710@xmath8 region centered on the shadow show a temperature @xmath3  k. the thermal continuum indicates a similar temperature for the dust </S>",
    "<S> . the molecular data also show evidence of freezeout onto dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a distance to cb190 of 400  pc using the spectroscopic parallax of a star associated with the globule . </S>",
    "<S> bonnor - ebert fits to the density profile , in conjunction with this distance , yield @xmath9 , indicating that cb@xmath10  may be unstable . the high temperature ( 56  k ) of the best fit bonnor - ebert model is in contradiction with the co and thermal continuum data , leading to the conclusion that the thermal pressure is not enough to prevent free - fall collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the turbulence in the cloud is inadequate to support it . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cloud may be supported by the magnetic field , if this field is at the average level for dark globules . since the magnetic field will eventually leak out through ambipolar diffusion , </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that cb@xmath10  is collapsing or in a late pre - collapse stage . </S>"
