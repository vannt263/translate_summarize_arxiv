    "the stellar haloes of normal disc galaxies are expected to be excellent repositories of fossil evidence from the epoch of galaxy formation , even though these components contain only a small fraction of the total light .",
    "this is because the stellar haloes are widely believed to have been formed through the disruption of infalling satellite dwarf galaxies over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "recent advances in observational techniques have allowed the detection of faint stellar haloes around external galaxies , such as m31 @xcite and other nearby disc galaxies @xcite .",
    "most stellar haloes have been shown to contain evidence of merger events in the form of tidal stellar streams .",
    "the number and physical properties of these streams appear to be in general agreement with the predictions of the @xmath7cdm model @xcite .    in spite of this",
    ", questions have been raised about the compatibility with the standard paradigm of the seemingly large differences in the properties of the stellar haloes and satellite systems of m31 and the milky way .",
    "these two systems have similar masses but m31 appears to have experienced a much more active merger history in the recent past , as suggested by its more disturbed stellar disc , larger bulge , younger and more metal - rich stellar populations , larger and more numerous tidal streams and surviving satellite galaxies @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the detection of extended stellar components around external galaxies has reinvigorated the efforts of modelling stellar haloes in the context of @xmath7cdm cosmogony .",
    "several theoretical studies suggest that the main properties of stellar haloes can be explained entirely by the accretion and disruption of satellites ( @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have been carried out using a combination of high - resolution dark matter - only simulations and simple semi - analytic prescriptions for assigning light ( i.e. , stellar mass ) to infalling satellites .",
    "recent studies using such ` hybrid ' methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) have taken advantage of the ultra - high resolution achieved by the latest generation of dark matter only milky way simulations ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , which allowed them to explore the properties of even the faintest substructures ( satellites and streams ) surviving to the present day .",
    "however , even though a large fraction of the stellar halo of normal disc galaxies may be explained by the accretion scenario , there remain some stellar populations in the milky way and other nearby galaxies that have not so far been accounted for in the context of accretion - only models .",
    "this has been known for a long time @xcite , but the evidence has become more convincing in the past few years .",
    "for example , the metal - rich halo stars in the solar neighbourhood have been shown to have a bi - modal [ @xmath8/fe]pattern @xcite .",
    "in particular , the high [ fe / h]- high [ @xmath8/fe]population seems to be the product of very rapid chemical evolution that can not be sustained in the potential wells of even the most massive accreted satellites @xcite . instead , it has been suggested that these stars may have formed `` in situ '' in the halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) or they may have been stirred up from the disc by repeated interactions with satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "similarly , models that track only the accreted component of the stellar halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) have difficulties matching the intermediate age ( @xmath9  gyr ) , metal - rich populations ( [ fe / h]@xmath10 ) detected in the halo of m31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there may also be an indication of a spatial differentiation in the stellar halo of the milky way : analysis of main - sequence turnoff stars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) suggests that the inner regions are more metal - rich ( e.g. , @xcite , but see @xcite ) and have a prograde motion with respect to the disc , while the outer halo is metal - poor and appears to have a small net retrograde rotation or no rotation , depending on the adopted the local standard of rest @xcite and/or the adopted distance scale @xcite . in addition , there is mounting evidence for a break in the slope of the density profile of the halo beyond @xmath11 kpc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent studies suggest that the inner regions of the halo are flattened ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is similar to what is seen for the inner regions of m31 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these results suggest that the stellar haloes of galaxies may have a dual nature , perhaps along the lines of the scenario proposed originally by @xcite : while the outer halo formed primarily by accretion / mergers , some of the inner halo has formed through dissipational collapse . however , in the current paradigm , the dissipative component would not have formed through monolithic collapse @xcite , but rather as a result of gas - rich mergers at early times .",
    "gas - dynamical simulations of disc galaxies formed in a hierarchical scenario produce stellar systems with a significant in situ dissipative component @xcite .",
    "it remains to be determined what the relative contributions of in situ and accreted stars are as a function of radius and system mass and , importantly , what the system - to - system scatter is in these contributions .",
    "the scatter in the in situ and accreted components may be at the heart of the reported large differences in the properties of the extended stellar distributions of the milky way and m31 .",
    "another important aspect that we address here , which may be related to the in situ vs.  accretion question , is the origin of large - scale metallicity gradients in stellar haloes .",
    "the emergence of metallicity gradients is a well - known consequence of dissipative collapse / mergers .",
    "the evidence in favour of metallicity gradients in local disc galaxies is mounting .",
    "for example , in the milky way , an underlying metallicity gradient in the halo is suggested by the net difference in the mean metallicity between the inner and outer halo ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "the halo of m31 also shows evidence for a gradient , where the inferred metallicity may drop by as much as @xmath12  dex from the inner regions of the galaxy out to @xmath13  kpc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : iron_profs ] below ) .",
    "ngc 891 represents another local milky way - analog for which there is evidence of a stellar metallicity gradient ( see @xcite ; although note that metallicity measurements have only been made out to 15 kpc for this system ) .",
    "models that form haloes by non - dissipative accretion and mergers have so far not been able to produce significant metallicity gradients @xcite .",
    "this suggests that either these models do not capture all the relevant physical processes ( e.g. , in situ star formation or ejection of disc stars by interaction with satellites ) or that they do not model the entire range of possible merger histories for milky way - mass galaxies in the cosmological context . in this study",
    "we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with a sophisticated treatment of chemodynamics to show that metallicity gradients are expected to be ubiquitous in the haloes of milky way - mass disc galaxies .",
    "the prominence of these gradients is shown to be tied to the fraction of the stellar mass that is formed in situ , which is itself determined by the merger histories of the galaxies .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : sims ] we describe the simulations and the selection of the sample milky way - mass disc galaxies . in section [ sec : halo ] we compute the average properties of stellar haloes of these galaxies , such as their density profiles , metallicity gradients ( both [ fe / h]and [ @xmath8/fe ] ) and metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) . in section [ sec : origin ]",
    "we quantify the contribution to the stellar spheroid from in situ star formation and accretion / disruption of satellites .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our main findings in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we use the galaxies - intergalactic medium interaction calculation ( gimic ) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , which were carried out by the virgo consortium and are described in detail by @xcite , hereafter c09 ( see also @xcite , hereafter c10 )",
    ". we will therefore present only a brief summary of the simulations here , focusing on the details most relevant for the present study .",
    "this suite of simulations is ideal for the present study for several reasons : ( i ) it simulates large volumes of the universe that contain numerous milky way - mass disc galaxies , allowing us to robustly quantify both the mean trends and the scatter ; ( ii ) it incorporates accurate physical prescriptions for metal - dependent radiative cooling , star formation , mass and energy feedback from type ia and type ii supernovae , as well as enrichment due to stellar evolution ( agb stars ) , which results in the formation of realistic disc galaxies ; and ( iii ) the relatively high numerical resolution is adequate for resolving the stellar haloes of individual milky way - mass galaxies and their most massive satellite galaxies ( i.e , the main contributors to the accreted component of the stellar halo ) .",
    "the suite consists of a set of hydrodynamical re - simulations of five nearly spherical regions ( @xmath14 mpc in radius ) extracted from the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "the regions were selected to have overdensities at @xmath15 that represent @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the root - mean - square deviation from the mean on this spatial scale .",
    "the 5 spheres are therefore environmentally diverse in terms of the large - scale structure that is present within them . for the purposes of the present study , however , we will only select systems with total ` main halo ' ( i.e. , the dominant subhalo in a friends - of - friends , hereafter fof , group ) masses similar to that of the milky way , irrespective of which gimic  volume it is in ( i.e. , irrespective of the large - scale environment ) .",
    "c09 found that the properties of systems of fixed main halo mass do not depend significantly on the large - scale environment ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "8 of that study ) .",
    "we plan to study the properties of such galaxies as a function of their _ local _ environment in a future study .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted for gimic  are the same as those assumed in the millennium simulation and correspond to a @xmath7cdm model with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the rms amplitude of linearly evolved mass fluctuations on a scale of @xmath23 mpc at @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum ) .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is approximately 2-sigma higher than has been inferred from the most recent cmb data @xcite , which will affect the abundance of milky way - mass systems somewhat , but should not significantly affect their individual properties .",
    "the simulations were evolved to @xmath24 using the treepm - sph code gadget-3   ( last described in @xcite ) .",
    "the gadget-3  code has been substantially modified to incorporate new baryonic physics .",
    "radiative cooling rates for the gas are computed on an element - by - element basis by interpolating within pre - computed tables generated with cloudy @xcite that contain cooling rates as a function of density , temperature , and redshift and that account for the presence of the cosmic microwave background and photoionisation from a @xcite ionising uv / x - ray background ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this background is switched on at @xmath31 in the simulation , where it ` reionises ' the entire simulation volume .",
    "star formation is tracked in the simulations following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "gas with densities exceeding the critical density for the onset of the thermo - gravitational instability is expected to be multiphase and to form stars @xcite . because the simulations lack both the physics and the resolution to model the cold interstellar gas phase , an effective equation of state ( eos ) is imposed with pressure @xmath32 for densities k when they cross the density threshold and if their density exceeds 57.7 times the cosmic mean .",
    "these criteria prevent star formation in intracluster gas and in intergalactic gas at very high redshift , respectively @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "as described in @xcite , gas on the effective eos is allowed to form stars at a pressure - dependent rate that reproduces the observed kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite by construction .",
    "the timed release of individual elements by both massive ( type ii sne and stellar winds ) and intermediate mass stars ( type ia sne and asymptotic giant branch stars ) is included following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "a set of 11 individual elements are followed in these simulations ( h , he , c , ca , n , o , ne , mg , s , si , fe ) , which represent all the important species for computing radiative cooling rates .    feedback from supernovae is incorporated using the kinetic wind model of @xcite with the initial wind velocity , @xmath36 , set to @xmath37 km / s and the mass - loading parameter ( i.e. , the ratio of the mass of gas given a velocity kick to that turned into newly formed star particles ) , @xmath38 , set to @xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to using approximately 80% of the total energy available from supernovae for a @xcite imf , which is assumed in the simulation .",
    "this choice of parameters results in a good match to the peak of the star formation rate history of the universe ( c09 ; see also @xcite ) and reproduces a number of x - ray / optical scaling relations for normal disc galaxies ( c10 ) .",
    "the gimic  simulations have been run at three levels of numerical resolution , ` low ' , ` intermediate ' , and ` high ' , to test for numerical convergence .",
    "the low - resolution simulations have the same mass resolution as the millennium simulation ( which , however , contains only dark matter ) while the intermediate- and high - resolution simulations have @xmath39 and @xmath40 times better mass resolution , respectively .",
    "in the case of the high - resolution simulations , only the @xmath41 volume was run to @xmath24 , owing to the computational expense of running such large volumes at this resolution .",
    "for the purposes of the present study , we therefore follow the approach of c10 and adopt the intermediate - resolution simulations in the main analysis and reserve the high - resolution @xmath41 simulation to test the numerical convergence of our results .",
    "the intermediate - resolution runs therefore have a dark matter particle mass @xmath42 m@xmath43 and an initial gas particle mass of @xmath44 m@xmath43 , implying that it is possible to resolve satellites with total stellar masses similar to those of the classical dwarf galaxies around the milky way ( with @xmath45 ) with several hundred up to @xmath46 particles .",
    "this is important for the present study , as it is currently believed that the disruption of such massive satellites is the primary contributor by mass to the _ accreted _ stellar halo @xcite . without a sufficiently large number of particles , the internal structure of the satellites",
    "will not be adequately resolved which can lead to overefficient tidal stripping of the satellites .",
    "in addition , relatively high resolution is required to model star formation in the satellites correctly .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite find they require at least several thousand to @xmath47 particles before convergent star formation histories are obtained for isolated dwarf galaxies simulated with the sph code gasoline .",
    "this is similar to the number of particles with which we resolve the most massive satellites galaxies in the high - resolution gimic  run . in the appendix",
    ", we present a convergence study for our simulations , comparing the results of the intermediate- and high - resolution gimic  simulations .",
    "we show that the present - day luminosity function of satellites , as well as the mass and metal distribution of the stellar halo , in our default intermediate - resolution runs are robust to an increase in the mass resolution of a factor of 8 . in table",
    "[ tab : res ] we present a summary of the mass and force resolution of the simulations used in this study .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : global_props ]    unlike @xcite , we have elected not to further decompose the spheroid into bulge and halo components . while separating the disc from the spheroid",
    "is relatively straightforward to do for both the observations and the simulations , separating the bulge from the stellar halo is more challenging , as there is no sharp distinction in the dynamics or the spatial distribution of the two components .",
    "a variety of techniques have been used in theoretical and observational studies to distinguish these components , which can complicate the comparison of any single component between different studies ( at least in the inner regions where the bulge and halo overlap spatially ) .",
    "our approach is to avoid this complication by simply reporting on the total bulge+halo component , which can readily be deduced from observations .",
    "lastly , we point out that we have not imposed any explicit constraints on the merger histories of the simulated galaxies .",
    "this is in contrast with many of the previous cosmological modelling studies of milky way - type galaxies , which usually select their simulation candidates from systems that have not undergone any major mergers in the recent past ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this condition is meant to ensure that these systems develop stellar discs that survive until the present day and that resemble the milky way s disc @xcite .",
    "note that these previous studies were based on hybrid methods applied to dark matter - only simulations and therefore did not have the benefit of being able to check which histories actually give rise to discs at the present day .",
    "importantly , more than @xmath55 of milky way - mass haloes have experienced major mergers ( defined as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the total mass of the satellite and @xmath58 is the stellar mass of the disc ) in the last 10 gyr @xcite , implying that the majority of merger histories may be excluded from studies that select only quiescent histories .",
    "the constraints applied to previous hybrid studies appear to be overly conservative , given that the majority of the milky way - mass systems in gimic  are disc - dominated systems ( see c10 ) .",
    "the resiliency of galactic discs to mergers likely stems from the fact that the galaxies contain a significant dissipational gaseous component ( that was not taken into account in , e.g. , @xcite ) , which is able to maintain ( or re - establish ) the disc ( see @xcite ) . in any case , for the present study , which is based on hydrodynamic simulations of large volumes , there is no need to place explicit constraints on the merger histories since we know which galaxies have prominent discs at @xmath24 .    applying the system mass and morphology criteria described above yields a total sample of 412 systems in the 5 intermediate - resolution gimic  volumes .",
    "this greatly exceeds the sample size of all previous studies of this type ( i.e. , those based on hydrodynamic re - simulations or hybrid methods ) , albeit at lower resolution than some previous studies ( such as @xcite ) .",
    "the large number of systems in our sample allows us to robustly quantify the system - to - system scatter present in the properties of stellar haloes .",
    "our work is therefore complementary to studies such as @xcite and @xcite , which are based on high - resolution simulations of a small number of systems .",
    "( but note we demonstrate in the appendix that the properties of our simulated stellar haloes are robust to increased numerical resolution . )    as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : galaxy ] shows the stellar and cold gas mass distributions of a typical simulated disc galaxy .",
    "an extended , flattened stellar distribution is clearly visible out to large radii .",
    "before analysing the detailed properties of the stellar haloes of the simulated disc galaxies , we briefly discuss the overall global properties of the sample galaxies .",
    "the motivation for this is simple : if the simulated galaxies were to look wholly unlike observed normal disc galaxies , then that would limit what can be concluded about the formation of their stellar haloes . as we show in section 3.1 , the simulated galaxies have global properties ( i.e. , total luminosities and stellar masses , rotation velocities , and satellite luminosity functions ) which are comparable to those estimated for the milky way and m31",
    "the reader who is interested only in the properties of the stellar haloes of the simulated galaxies may wish to skip ahead to section 3.2 .      in table 1",
    "we present the typical properties of the simulated disc galaxies , split into several halo mass ( @xmath59 ) bins .",
    "in particular , we list total v - band magnitude ( @xmath60 , in ab mags . ) , total stellar mass within @xmath50 [ @xmath61 , disc rotation speed at the solar radius [ @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is assumed to be @xmath64  kpc ] and mean stellar metallicity within and beyond a galacto - centric distance of 30 kpc ( [ fe / h]@xmath65 ) .",
    "( the choice of 30 kpc is motivated below , where we show how the physical nature of the bulge+halo component changes with radius . )",
    "the values listed in table 1 are medians for galaxies in the mass bin , while the error bars represent the @xmath66 and @xmath67 percentiles .",
    "we also list the number of galaxies in each mass bin ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the v - band luminosity of star particles in the simulations is calculated as follows .",
    "each star particle is treated as a simple stellar population ( ssp ) .",
    "the ages and metallicities of star particles are used to compute the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) by interpolating over the galaxev  models of @xcite .",
    "the v - band luminosity is obtained by integrating the product of the sed with the v - band filter transmission function .",
    "we ignore the effects of dust attenuation in this calculation .",
    "as already noted , the gimic  simulations successfully reproduce the peak of the observed star formation rate density history of the universe , as well as the x - ray - optical scaling properties of normal disc galaxies ( c10 ) .",
    "another notable success of the simulations is that they produce large numbers of disc galaxies ( see fig .  1 of c10 ) .",
    "realistic spiral discs have been notoriously difficult to achieve in the past with cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we will present a detailed analysis of the galaxy discs in a future study ( mccarthy et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the gimic  simulations , however , do not reproduce the bright end of the global galaxy luminosity function , @xmath69 ( see c09 ) .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as the simulations lack feedback from supermassive black holes , which is thought to be crucial for regulating star formation in the most massive systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the match to the observed abundance of @xmath1 galaxies is , however , reasonable .",
    "one should also recall that the luminosity function depends not only on the luminosity as a function of halo mass ( which we quote below ) , but also on the number density of dark matter haloes , which depends on the adopted cosmological parameters .",
    "this implies that one can obtain correct properties of individual galaxies but still not reproduce the observed luminosity function , if the wrong cosmological parameters are adopted .",
    "therefore , a better approach to assessing whether the simulated galaxies are realistic , is to compare the mass - to - light ratio ( or total luminosity ) as a function of halo mass with the observations , which we do immediately below .     the mean satellite luminosity function of simulated galaxies in the intermediate - resolution gimic  simulation .",
    "the black dashed curve represents the mean luminosity function for all the simulated galaxies .",
    "the thick black solid curve represents the mean luminosity function for simulated galaxies in the mass range @xmath70 ( 128 disc galaxies meet this criteria ) .",
    "the hatched region represents the poisson error distribution for this luminosity function .",
    "the solid , red and blue histograms show the satellite luminosity functions for the milky way and m31 , respectively .",
    "the milky way data is taken from @xcite and the m31 data is taken from @xcite .",
    "overall , massive galaxies in our sample produce luminosity functions that are quite similar to those observed for the milky way and m31 , suggesting that the accreted component of the halo in the simulations should have a realistic mass fraction . ]    for comparison , m31 has an absolute visual magnitude of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 km / s .",
    "the absolute magnitude was calculated using the _ galex _ apparent v magnitude of @xcite and assuming a distance to m31 of 785 kpc .",
    "the total stellar mass was calculated using b - v and v of @xcite to infer the stellar @xmath74 using the relation of @xcite and scaling the result by 0.7 to convert from the salpeter imf assumed by @xcite to a chabrier imf , which is adopted in the gimic  simulations .",
    "the rotation velocity , which has been corrected for inclination , was obtained from the hyperleda data base .",
    "the milky way has a total stellar mass of @xmath75 @xcite locally and apply it to the galaxy to estimate the total stellar mass .",

    "these properties of m31 and the milky way are quite typical of the simulated galaxies , particularly those with halo masses of @xmath77 .",
    "we will comment in detail on the metallicity of the stellar halo of both observed and simulated systems below .",
    "how do the d / t ratios for m31 and the milky way compare with that of our simulated galaxies ?",
    "the d / t ratio for m31 and the milky way have been estimated by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , by modelling the surface brighrtness distribution of the galaxies and assuming a particular stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "@xcite find @xmath78 for m31 and @xcite find @xmath79 ( the exact value depending on the surface brightness modelling assumptions ) .",
    "these values fall within the simulated d / t distribution when the dynamical method of c10 is used but they are larger than any of values of d / t estimated using the method of @xcite with the angular momentum cut of @xcite .",
    "this begs the question , which is the appropriate comparison to make ?",
    "the answer is likely to be neither . as pointed out recently by @xcite",
    ", there can be large systematic differences in the d / t ratios inferred through kinematic and ` morphological ' ( i.e. , based on surface brightness modelling ) methods .",
    "in particular , those authors found by analysing simulated galaxies in the same way as observers do ( i.e. , morphologically , including dust attenuation ) they typically recovered much higher d / t ratios than that recovered with the standard dynamical decomposition applied by simulators .",
    "thus , to make a more meaningful comparison between our simulated galaxies and m31 and the milky way would require analysing our simulations in the same way as has been done for these two galaxies .",
    "this is clearly a worthwhile exercise but is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "since the present work concerns itself with the properties of the extended stellar distributions of disc galaxies ( i.e. , the spheroids ) , it is also important to check whether the simulations yield reasonable satellite luminosity functions and radial distributions , since a significant fraction of the spheroid ( by volume at least ) is thought to have been assembled through the tidal disruption of massive satellites . in fig .",

    "this is shallower than in the outer regions , but note that the mass density profile has a higher normalisation at small radii , so that a power - law with slope @xmath84 extrapolated to the inner regions underpredicts the mass density there .",
    "in general , our results confirm those of several previous theoretical studies on the shape of the mass density profile at larger radii .",
    "for example , @xcite , who used a hybrid semi - analytic plus idealised n - body approach to study the formation of the stellar halo , find that a power - law with index of @xmath84 describes the shape of their haloes very well at radii of @xmath113 kpc .",

    "in particular , @xcite find that their profiles become increasingly flat at small radii , so that the logarithmic slope approaches @xmath117 for @xmath118 kpc , whereas our spheroid component shows no evidence of flattening at small radii - on the contrary , the profile actually steepens somewhat at radii of @xmath90 kpc before leveling off to a slope of @xmath119 at @xmath120 kpc .",
    "this dramatic flattening in the @xcite model is almost certainly in part due to the neglect of in situ star formation in their hybrid n - body model , but another potentially important factor is the treatment of the galaxy potential well , which does not feel the back - reaction due to the orbiting satellites in their idealised n - body simulations .",
    "for example , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , who applied a similar hybrid method to cosmological n - body simulations with ` live ' galaxy potential wells , find a relatively steep distribution at small radii , with a logarithmic slope of @xmath119 .",

    "the fact that our _ total _",

    "one can go deeper by stacking distant galaxies .",

    "[ in the appendix , we test the numerical convergence of the stellar mass density profiles .",
    "we demonstrate there that our results ( both median and scatter ) are quite robust to a factor of eight increase in the mass resolution . ]",

    "in addition to the lines corresponding to the stellar components described above , the left panel of fig .  [",

    "the dot - dashed cyan curve _ is not a fit _ to the dot - dashed blue curve .",
    "a comparison of the dot - dashed blue curve with the solid red curve demonstrates that dark matter dominates over the stellar contribution down to very small radii ( the two become comparable at a few kpc ) .",
    "comparison of the dot - dashed blue and cyan curves shows that the nfw analytic form provides an excellent description of the dark matter density profile beyond about @xmath149 kpc ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) . within this radius , the dark matter profile steepens , presumably as a result of contraction of the dark matter halo due to the condensation of baryons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given that the nfw profile drops off as @xmath151 at intermediate radii and as @xmath152 at large radii , this implies that the stellar mass density profile drops off significantly faster than that of the dark matter , as is clearly visible in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_profs ] .",
    "this is also consistent with the findings of previous theoretical studies of the stellar halo ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the difference in the stellar and dark matter distributions likely stems from the fact that the stars in infalling satellites are more tightly bound , and thus less susceptible to tidal disruption , than their dark matter haloes .",
    "in addition , the most massive satellites ( which also have the highest stellar mass fractions ) will spiral more quickly into the center due to dynamical friction , which scales as mass squared .",
    "finally , in situ star formation will occur preferentially in the central regions ( due to the higher gas densities there ) .",
    "these effects would produce a more centrally - concentrated stellar distribution , as seen in the simulations as well as in the observations .",
    "the radial distribution of stellar metallicity is a particularly interesting test of the simulations , since previous simulations / models in the @xmath7cdm context have not been able to reproduce the significant gradients seen in m31 and the milky way .",
    "it is not presently clear why this is the case .",

    "the mdf is similar in shape ( in particular , fitting a gaussian distribution yields similar widths of @xmath162  dex ) , but the peak shifts to lower metallicities with increasing radius , which is what gives rise ( mathematically at least ) to the metallicity gradients in the left panel of fig .",

    "we first quantify the relative importance of accretion vs.  in situ star formation for the formation of the stellar halo .",
    "we show that the break in the mass density and surface brightness profiles near @xmath161 kpc and the sharp rise in the stellar halo metallicity profile at similar radii are all caused by the transition from accretion - dominated to in situ - dominated star formation ( section [ sec : formation_mode ] ) .",

    "stars are said to be ` accreted ' if they formed either in another fof group or in a satellite galaxy ( i.e. , not the dominant subhalo ) of the mmp . in practice , only a small proportion ( 2% ) of the stellar halo is from stars that formed in satellites of the mmp and were then stripped ; most of the accreted stars were formed in other fof groups ( i.e. , other haloes ) before they became satellites of the mmp .",
    "the procedure by which we identify the mmp and determine whether a given star particle was accreted or formed in situ is as follows .",

    "there exists a correlation ( again with considerable scatter ) between in situ mass fraction and formation epoch , in that older systems have higher in situ mass fractions .",
    "physically this makes sense , as older systems have been able to form stars quiescently for a longer period of time , while dynamically younger systems accreted relatively larger amounts of mass recently . the fact that dynamically older systems have higher in situ mass fractions is consistent with the findings of @xcite , although our improved statistics shows that the scatter in this correlation is large .",
    "it is interesting that , even though the accreted stars are quite old ( as indicated by the dashed blue curve in fig .",

    "we find that the inner accreted halo was formed a long time ago ( @xmath178 gyr ) , but that the outer accreted halo was assembled as recently as 5 gyr ago .",
    "we therefore expect to see increased spatial lumpiness and more coherent velocity structure at large radii , since there has been less time since accretion for phase mixing and violent relaxation to act .",
    "we plan to examine the degree of substructure in the spheroidal component in a future paper .",
    "we have shown that it is in situ star formation that is responsible for the change in the nature of the stellar halo at @xmath3 kpc .",

    "[ fig : rinit_rfinal ] shows that the vast majority of in situ stars are presently located at , and were also formed at , relatively small radii ( @xmath3 kpc ) . at these radial distances",
    "there is a relatively large scatter about the @xmath185 = r[z_{\\rm form}]$ ] relation , indicating that in situ stars have migrated in both directions ( i.e. , toward and away from the present galaxy center ) .",
    "a very small fraction of the in situ stars were formed at relatively large radii ( @xmath89 kpc ) . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : rinit_rfinal ] these stars have since migrated inward somewhat .",
    "naively , it seems surprising that star formation can occur at such large galactocentric radii .",
    "the density and temperature criteria imposed in the simulations for placing gas particles on the star - forming eos ( see section 2 ) guarantee that these in situ stars formed from gas that was both dense and cold .",
    "we have analysed the in situ star formation in the outer halo in depth .",
    "first , such star formation is virtually absent in the simulated galaxies at the present day . like the majority of the population , these stars formed at @xmath186 .",
    "this suggests a physical ( rather than spurious numerical ) origin to these stars .",
    "second , stars formed beyond @xmath187 \\ga 20 $ ] kpc show up as ` streaks ' in a plot of @xmath187 $ ] against @xmath181 ( i.e. , collections of stars formed at very similar time over a wide range of 3d radii ) , whereas at small radii there is a larger and more homogeneous spread in ages .",
    "this suggests that the large - radii stars are forming in streams ( filaments ) of dense / cold gas .",
    "finally , examination of simple movies of the high - resolution simulation shows that the star formation indeed occurs in filaments of cold gas , which has recently been ram pressure - stripped from infalling satellites .",
    "this type of star formation has been seen in sph simulations previously ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for idealised test cases",
    "it has been shown that the sph formalism can inhibit the development of fluid instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which could potentially disrupt the clouds / filaments .",
    "thus , it is possible that our simulations overestimate the degree of in situ star formation at such large radii . in any case",

    "our results differ from those of @xcite in terms of the radius of in situ star formation , with the in situ stars in our simulations forming at radii comparable to where they are presently located .",
    "our in situ stellar population is also younger than that of @xcite ( who found @xmath188 ) , having formed primarily at @xmath189 , which is similar to that also reported recently by @xcite for galaxies with masses similar to those in our sample .",
    "the differences in the formation radii and ages of the in situ stars in our simulations and those of @xcite would be expected if the feedback in their simulations is relatively less efficient in low - mass haloes .",
    "this indeed appears to the case , as their simulations significantly overproduce the number of bright satellite galaxies orbiting milky way - mass galaxies today ( see fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "more importantly , the above differences imply a different formation scenario for in situ stars in our simulations compared with those of @xcite . in mccarthy",
    "( in prep . )",
    ", we will show that a large fraction of the in situ stars formed from the cooling of _ hot _ gas ( rather than cold flows , as advocated by @xcite ) during the initial assembly of the disc .",
    "this has profound implications for a wide range of properties of these stars today , including their spatial distribution , kinematics and metallicities .",
    "@xcite have recently demonstrated , using high quality photometric and spectropscopic observations , that many of the largest nearby disc galaxies lack obvious classical bulge components ( i.e. , are `` bulgeless '' ) .",
    "these authors have argued that it is difficult to reconcile a significant population of bulgeless galaxies with the standard hierarchical model for galaxy formation , since mergers are a key ingredient of this model and are believed to produce bulges .",
    "however , recent high resolution cosmological simulations have been able to successfully produce bulgeless dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the key to this success appears to be the implementation of _ efficient _ supernova feedback , which preferentially removes the lowest angular momentum gas via outflows @xcite .",
    "what about more massive simulated galaxies ?",
    "it turns out that the gimic  simulations produce a number of massive `` bulgeless '' galaxies , which will be examined in detail in sales et al .",
    "( in prep ) .    for the present study , it is interesting to ask whether the simulated galaxies with small ( fractional ) bulge components have stellar haloes at all and , if so , what is the contribution of in situ star formation .",
    "it is of interest to note that real bulgeless _ dwarf _ galaxies do indeed have faint , old stellar halos @xcite and so do the simulated bulgeless dwarf galaxies of @xcite .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgeless ] we compare the median spherically - averaged stellar mass density profiles of the total bulge+halo and the in situ bulge+halo components for our entire sample of galaxies with a subset of galaxies with high d / t and a subset with low d / t .",
    "interestingly , we find that the total and in situ haloes have _ larger _ mass densities in systems with high d / t ratios .",
    "this is the opposite of what one might have naively expected .",
    "the reason for this trend is provided in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgeless ] , which is a scatter plot of d / t versus the total stellar mass ( disc+bulge+halo ) for all the simulated galaxies .",
    "as can be seen , the highest d / t galaxies have larger total stellar masses ( and larger stellar mass fractions ) on average than galaxies with low d / t .",
    "this explains why the _ absolute _ mass densities of the in situ bulge+halo component in high - d / t systems is larger than that of this component in low - d / t systems .",
    "it should be noted that this comparison is being made at essentially fixed total system mass ( @xmath59 varies by only a factor of @xmath4 over our sample ) . by comparison ,",
    "the total stellar mass @xmath190 varies by factor of @xmath135 across the sample .",
    "thus , based on results in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgeless ] `` bulgeless '' galaxies may actually have the most prominent stellar haloes at fixed total system mass , which is an interesting prediction of the model that should be testable in the future .",
    "the origin of the relatively strong d / t-@xmath190 trend over the narrow range of total system masses considered in this study is unclear and requires further examination .",
    "furthermore , whether or not this trend is consistent with observations should be investigated . however , as discussed in section 3.1 , care must be taken to measure d / t in the same way for both real and simulated galaxies .",
    "we set out to address the question of the possible dual - nature of the extended stellar distributions around the milky way , m31 , and other @xmath191 nearby galaxies .",
    "in particular , what are the relative contributions ( by mass ) to the stellar spheroid from tidal stripping / disruption of satellites and ` in situ ' star formation ? and what is the origin of the metallicity gradients observed in the milky way and m31 ?",
    "we have used the gimic  suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to address these important questions .",
    "gimic  is ideal for this purpose as it contains large numbers ( @xmath91 ) of milky way - mass galaxies simulated at relatively high - resolution ( @xmath192 m@xmath43 and a gravitational softening of @xmath193 kpc ) and with sophisticated prescriptions for radiative cooling , chemodynamics , and supernova feedback .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * the simulated stellar mass density of the spheroid ( bulge+halo ) falls off as @xmath167 at large radii ( @xmath89 kpc ) , in agreement with the findings of previous theoretical studies based on hybrid analytic+n - body methods and cosmological hydrodynamical re - simulations , as well as deep observations of m31 .",
    "fitting all @xmath91 simulated galaxies separately , we find the 1-sigma ( 2-sigma ) scatter in the logarithmic slope is @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "* in the inner region , the simulated mass density profile can be fit very well with a de vaucouleurs profile with a median @xmath196 kpc ( with considerable system - to - system scatter ) , and relatively well with a power - law with logarithmic slope @xmath197 .",
    "this is shallower than in the outer regions , but note that the mass density profile has a higher normalisation at small radii , so that a power - law with slope @xmath84 extrapolated to the inner regions underpredicts the mass density there .",
    "the increased normalisation and still fairly steep profile at small radii differs from that found previously with hybrid analytic+n - body methods , which is most likely due to their neglect of in situ star formation .",
    "the shape of our simulated mass density profile matches that inferred for m31 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_profs ] ) and other nearby galaxies remarkably well .",
    "* _ significant negative metallicity gradients are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated galaxy populations .",
    "_ typically [ fe / h ] drops by 0.6 to 0.9 dex from the inner ( @xmath198 kpc ) to the outer ( @xmath199 kpc ) regions ( see middle panel of fig .  [",

    "this drop is compatible with that inferred for the mw ( e.g. , @xcite ) and m31 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : iron_profs ] ) . * on average , 2/3 of the mass of the stellar spheroid ( bulge+halo )",
    "is composed of stars that formed in situ , but with considerable system - to - system scatter .",
    "limiting the comparison to @xmath170 kpc , this fraction drops to 1/5 on average . *",
    "the large contribution from in situ star formation in the inner regions drives the change in slope of the mass density profile at @xmath200  kpc and also gives rise to large - scale metallicity gradients .",
    "* on average , the in situ stars were formed at radii comparable to their present distance from the galactic center , with considerable migration in both directions ( towards and away from the center ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : rinit_rfinal ] ) .",

    "see mccarthy et al .",
    "( in prep . ) for further discussion . * at fixed total mass , @xmath59 , galaxies with high d / t ratios actually have the most prominent stellar haloes ( in terms of absolute mass density ) .",
    "this owes to the presence of a strong trend between d / t and total ( disc+bulge+halo ) stellar mass .    in the introduction we noted that the large differences in the properties of the stellar bulge+halo of the milky way and m31 ( particularly their metallicities ) has raised questions about the compatibility with the @xmath7cdm scenario .",
    "as we have shown , however , there is considerable system - to - system scatter in the mean metallicities ( as well as in the prominence of metallicity gradients ) of the simulated milky way - mass systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_insitu ] ) .",
    "the scatter is roughly compatible with the observed differences between the milky way and m31 .",
    "m31 is typically considered to be more dynamically active than the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation between the epoch of formation and the in situ mass fraction found in the simulations would therefore suggest that the milky way has a higher in situ mass fraction than m31 ( as also argued by @xcite )",
    ". however , this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that we find that the in situ mass fraction is also correlated with system metallicity , in the sense that more metal rich systems have higher in situ fractions ( and that m31 has a more metal rich spheroidal component than the milky way ) .",
    "however , as we have already noted , the simulations predict a large degree of scatter in these correlations , which may reconcile this issue",
    ".    it would clearly be very interesting to _ measure _ the in situ mass fraction of the spheroidal components of the milky way and andromeda and compare it directly to the predictions of the simulations ( e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_insitu ] ) . given their different formation histories ,",
    "we expect there to be differences in the detailed spatial distributions and kinematics of the in situ and accreted stellar components , and this may hold the key to unambiguously separating these components from one another .",
    "we examine the kinematic properties , as well as the 3d spatial structure , of the in situ and accreted components in mccarthy et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "it should be borne in mind that there are clear limitations in comparing a large sample of simulated galaxies ( which could have unforseen `` systematic errors '' , e.g. , lack important physics ) to one with very poor number statistics .",
    "probing the diffuse stellar haloes of large samples of more distant galaxies will go a very long way towards verifying ( or refuting ) the picture we have proposed . at present , it is only possible to probe the haloes of distant galaxies by stacking large samples of them ( e.g , @xcite ) , but then one loses information about the system - to - system scatter , which is predicted to be large . in the coming years , observations with the large synoptic survey telescope ( for example ) ,",

    "<S> we use the galaxies - intergalactic medium interaction calculation ( gimic ) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of stellar spheroids of milky way - mass disc galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations contain accurate treatments of metal - dependent radiative cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , and chemodynamics , and the large volumes that have been simulated yield an unprecedentedly large sample of @xmath0 simulated @xmath1 disc galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated galaxies are surrounded by low - mass , low - surface brightness stellar haloes that extend out to @xmath2 kpc and beyond . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse stellar distributions bear a remarkable resemblance to those observed around the milky way , m31 and other nearby galaxies , in terms of mass density , surface brightness , and metallicity profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in situ star formation typically dominates the stellar spheroids by mass at radii of @xmath3  kpc , whereas accretion of stars dominates at larger radii and this change in origin induces a change in slope of the surface brightness and metallicity profiles , which is also present in the observational data . </S>",
    "<S> the system - to - system scatter in the in situ mass fractions of the spheroid , however , is large and spans over a factor of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there is a large degree of scatter in the shape and normalisation of the spheroid density profile within @xmath3  kpc ( e.g. , when fit by a spherical powerlaw profile the indices range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the in situ mass fraction of the spheroid is linked to the formation epoch of the system . </S>",
    "<S> dynamically older systems have , on average , larger contributions from in situ star formation , although there is significant system - to - system scatter in this relationship . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in situ star formation likely represents the solution to the longstanding failure of pure accretion - based models to reproduce the observed properties of the inner spheroid .    </S>",
