    "ultraluminous and luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs / lirgs ) have strong infrared ( ir ) luminosities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively @xcite .",
    "their intense ir luminosities are mainly due to starburst activities , and the contribution of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to ir luminosity seems to be rather limited , i.e. , @xmath7 @xcite . the starburst activities in ( u)lirgs are likely to be triggered by mergings of galaxies , in particular gas - rich galaxies , since observations suggest that ( u)lirgs have complex and disturbed morphologies @xcite . in the @xmath8-band ( f814w filter )",

    "the fraction increases to more than @xmath11 , if all probable galaxies are included @xcite .",
    "the origin of the multiple nuclei has been thought to be multiple major merger events . in order to explain multiple mergers",
    ", @xcite argued that the progenitors of ( u)lirgs , were compact groups of galaxies .",
    "however , the evolution timescale of compact groups is very long ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the probability that two galaxies merge in a compact group and the merging galaxy has double cores is @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the merging timescale of the galactic cores .",
    "the probability that another galaxy merges with such merging galaxy in the compact group and the merging galaxy has triple cores is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the typical number of galaxies in a compact group @xcite .",
    "then , the number density of ulirgs with multiple cores is @xmath20 @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the number density of galaixes in a compact group @xcite .",
    "since the number density of ulirgs is @xmath24 @xcite , the fraction of multiple merger to ulirgs is @xmath25 .",
    "thus , it is unliky that multiple merger is a major cause of the observed multiple nuclei in ( u)lirgs .",
    "an alternative explanation for the origin of multiple nuclei in ( u)lirgs seems necessary .",
    "previous numerical simulations of merging galaxies @xcite have shown that starbursts occurred during the merging process . however , these simulations failed to reproduce formation of star clusters as observed in many interacting and merging galaxies @xcite , since their spatial and mass resolutions ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) were not sufficiently high to distinguish star forming region and formation of star clusters whose sizes are less than @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , previous simulations did not allow the interstellar medium ( ism ) to cool below @xmath28 .",
    "this is another reason why formation of star clusters was not reproduced in the previous simulations .    in order to reproduce formation of star clusters ,",
    "high resolution simulations have been attempted .",
    "@xcite have performed the simulation of a merging galaxy using tree+sph code gadget . in this simulation , mass and spatial resolutions were @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "they assumed an isothermal ism and used sink particles , that absorb their surrounding gas , to represent clusters .",
    "they have shown that a number of massive clusters form in the merging process . in this simulation ,",
    "the most massive cluster has mass of @xmath31 . @xcite",

    "mass and spatial resolutions were @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "they have also shown formations of massive star clusters with masses of @xmath34 .",
    "these simulations are , however , unrealistic in a sense that dynamical evolution of star clusters themselves can not be properly followed due to the limitation of the sticky and sink particle methods .",
    "@xcite improved the spatial and mass resolutions ( @xmath35-@xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and the ism model that is allowed to cool to @xmath38 .",
    "these simulations showed that the behavior of the multiphase ism in the merging galaxies is considerably altered and the formation of shock - induced star clusters is naturally reproduced @xcite .",
    "there are several high resolution simulations of merging galaxies , which resolve the low temperature gas ( @xmath39-@xmath40 ) using adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) methods @xcite .",
    "these simulations also showed the difference in the behavior of the multiphase ism from that of ism used in the previous simulations . @xcite considered the merger of low - mass galaxies ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "several spiky peaks of star formation rate were seen in thier simulation although the most prominet starburst was found at the beginning the simualtions and the significant fraction of the ism was blown away by energetic wind before the merging event .",
    "thus , it would be hard to investigate detailed evolution of the ism in merging galaxies .",
    "in @xcite , the polytropic equation of state was used instead of solving the energy equation , which is essentially different from @xcite and present paper .",
    "the validity of this approximation is unclear for understanding the evolution of the ism in the merging galaxies .",
    "high - resolution images of the local ( u)lirgs obtained by the integral field spectroscopy using _ william herschel telescope _ @xcite and _ vlt - vimos _ @xcite showed that ( u)lirgs generally have very complex structures , such as h@xmath42 bright knots , rings , and tidal tails .",
    "as in the case of formation of star clusters , the reason why these structures have not been reproduced in numerical simulations might be just the inadequate treatment of ism and limited resolution .",
    "thus , high resolution simulations resolving multiphase ism are essential to comprehend the complex structures in ( u)lirgs .",
    "we have performed high - resolution simulations of merging galaxies with sufficiently high spatial resolution and cooling function of ism that covers a wide range of temperature ( @xmath43 ) . in this paper , we focus on the origin of the observed ulirgs with multiple nuclei . the detailed evolution of merging galaxies will be described in forthcoming papers .",
