    "some of the best astrophysical observatories in the world , namely the canarian , chilean and hawaiian observatories , are located within active geological regions .",
    "this is not a coincidence , since topography modelled by tectonic and/or volcanic activity is a main factor controlling the local atmospheric conditions and hence , the sky transparency that defines good astronomical sites .",
    "the characterization of astronomical sites is usually based on the analysis of the atmosphere above them @xcite .",
    "however , increasingly larger telescopes ( 10 and 40 metres classes ) demand stable structures and buildings , and hence geological activity becomes an important parameter to take into account in astronomical site ranking @xcite .",
    "the structures of large telescopes have and will have to withstand the effects associated to seismic and/or volcanic activity , but they also have to minimize the loss of operational time , recalling the extreme precision in the alignment of mechanical and optical components .",
    "the west coast of hawaii experienced in 2006 october 15 , a m=6.7 earthquake followed by a m=6.0 aftershock and many smaller aftershocks .",
    "there was not significant structural damage at the telescope facilities , however the recovery to full science operability at subaru , keck i and ii and gemini north telescopes took several weeks @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present an analysis of seismic and volcanic activity at four world - class observatories , namely roque de los muchachos ( la palma , canary islands , 28.75@xmath0n , 17.89@xmath0e , 2400 m.a.s.l . ) , el teide ( tenerife , canary islands , 28.3@xmath0n , 16.51@xmath0e , 2380 m.a.s.l . ) , paranal ( chile , 24.62@xmath0s , 70.4@xmath0e , 2620 m.a.s.l . ) and mauna kea ( hawaii , 19.82@xmath0n , 155.47@xmath0e , 4130 m.a.s.l . ) and the candidate site of cerro ventarrones ( chile , 24.35@xmath0s , 70.2@xmath0e , 2200 m.a.s.l . ) .",
    "we carried out a comparative analysis of the hazard associated to lava flows , volcanic ashfall , seismicity and ground deformation on telescope facilities for a return period of 50 years , assuming this time span corresponds to the approximate lifetime for a large telescope .",
    "flank collapses of island volcanoes @xcite , involving mass movements of tenths to thousands cubic kilometres of rocks , were not considered in this analysis , since their recurrence interval exceedes 100000 years for the canarian and hawaiian islands @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the triggering mechanisms of these events and the nature of the mass movements are a matter of debate , recalling that humans have not yet witnessed any of these catastrophic events .",
    "tenerife is the largest island of the canarian archipelago and one of the largest volcanic islands in the world .",
    "it is located between latitudes 28 - 29@xmath0n and longitudes 16 - 17@xmath0w , 280 km distant from the african coast .",
    "the morphology of tenerife ( see figures 1 and 2 ) is the result of a complex geological evolution : the emerged part of the island was originally constructed by fissural eruptions that occurred between 12 and 3.3 ma @xcite . in the central part of the island , where the observatory is located , the emission of basalts and differentiated volcanics gave rise to a large central volcanic complex , the las caadas edifice , that culminated in the formation of a large elliptical depression measuring 16x9 km@xmath1 , known as las caadas caldera @xcite . in the northern sector of the caldera ,",
    "the teide - pico viejo complex was constructed as the product of the most recent phase of central volcanism .",
    "teide - pico viejo is a large stratovolcano that has grown during the last 175 ka .",
    "the basaltic activity , which overlaps the las caadas edifice , is mainly found on two ridges ( ne and nw ) , which converge on the central part of the island .",
    "large scale lateral collapses , involving mass movements of hundreds of cubic kilometres of rock , are responsible for the formation of three valleys @xcite , namely la orotava ( 0.35 - 0.65 ma ) , gimar ( 0.75 - 0.85 ma ) and icod ( 0.17 ma ) valleys .",
    "eruptive activity at mount izaa , where el teide observatory is located , ceased more than 300 ka , after the formation of la orotava valley @xcite , whereas recorded eruptive activity in tenerife has consisted of six strombolian eruptions , namely siete fuentes ( 1704 ) , fasnia ( 1705 ) , arafo ( 1705 ) , arenas negras ( 1706 ) , chahorra ( 1798 ) and chinyero ( 1909 ) .",
    "the last three eruptions occurred at the nw ridge , the most active area of the island , together with el teide - pico viejo complex , for the last 50,000 years @xcite .",
    "the island of la palma is the fifth in extension ( 706 km@xmath1 ) of the canary islands and the second in elevation ( 2426 m.a.s.l . ) after tenerife ( figures 1 and 3 ) .",
    "the two main stages of the development of oceanic volcanoes , the submarine and subaerial stages , outcrop in la palma , since the submarine basement or seamount that was built during the pliocene ( 4 to 2 ma ) were uplifted up to 1.3 km above the present sea level @xcite .",
    "the subaerial edifice is conformed by a series of overlapping volcanoes @xcite : ( 1 ) the northern shield of the island includes the garafa shield volcano ( 1.7 to 1.2 ma ) , the taburiente shield volcano ( 1.1 to 0.4 ma ) and the bejenado edifice ( 0.55 to 0.49 ma ) ; the caldera de taburiente , in the center of the old shield , and cumbre nueva ridge formed by a combination of large landslides and erosion ; ( 2 ) the cumbre vieja volcano ( 0.4 ma to present ) in the southern half of the island . the cumbre vieja ridge is interpreted to be a volcanic rift zone because of the prominent north - south alignment of vents , fissures and faults .",
    "morphologically , cumbre vieja is an extension of the cumbre nueva ridge and resembles a separate volcano from the northern shield as a result of an emigration of the volcanic activity to the south .",
    "historic eruptions on la palma have lasted between 24 and 84 days and were recorded in 1470/1492 ( uncertain ) , 1585 , 1646 , 1677 - 78 , 1712 , 1949 and 1971 @xcite .",
    "the roque de los muchachos observatory is located atop the taburiente edifice , at the rim of the caldera de taburiente , and hence , eruptive activity ceased more than 0.4 ma ago .",
    "the island of hawaii is the youngest island in a chain of volcanoes that stretches about 5600 kilometres across the northern pacific ocean .",
    "the island chain results from a magma source that originates deep beneath the crust . the ocean crust and lithosphere above the magma source , within the pacific tectonic plate ,",
    "move to the northwest with respect to the deep stationary magma source . over a span of about 70 million years",
    ", new island volcanoes are formed and older volcanoes are carried away from the magma source , erode , and eventually subside beneath sea level @xcite .",
    "hawaiian volcanoes erupt lavas of distinct chemical compositions during four different stages in their evolution and growth : a ) pre - shield stage , representing between 1 - 2% of the total volume , b ) shield stage , representing 97 - 98% of the total volume , c ) post - shield and post - caldera stage , representing 1% of the total volume and d ) rejuvenated stage , representing a lot less than 1% of the total volume .",
    "the island of hawaii , the largest of the entire hawaiian chain , consists of five main volcanoes : kilauea , mauna loa , mauna kea , kohala and hualalai ( fig .",
    "4 ) . kilauea and mauna loa volcanoes are in the shield stage and erupt frequently , hualalai and mauna kea volcanoes are in the post - shield stage and erupt every few hundred to few thousand years , and kohala is dormant , having passed through the post - shield stage .",
    "kohala last erupted about 120 ka , mauna kea about 3,6 ka , and hualalai in 1800 - 1801 @xcite .",
    "the andes is a mountain chain which extends along the western edge of the south american plate . in this region",
    ", the nazca plate thrusts beneath south america at a rate of approximately 64 and 79 mm / year @xcite in an east - north - east direction , forming the peru - chile trench in the ocean s floor ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "the andes span a total length of about 9000 km extending from colombia to the chile triple junction around 46@xmath0s , which defines the interaction point of the south american , antarctic and nazca plates .",
    "the nazca plate is divided into several segments , whose main difference are convergence direction and dipping angle of the slab @xcite",
    ". in general , normal or steep dipping slab segments have angles around 30@xmath0 , whereas in shallow segments this angle does not exceed 15@xmath0 .",
    "the angle of the segments also define the presence of volcanic activity , since in shallow segments there have not been volcanic activity at least since the miocene .",
    "both paranal and cerro ventarrones are located in the central andes region ( 15@xmath0s to 27.5@xmath0s ) , above a steep dipping segment of the nazca plate , hence volcanic activity is present , although this takes place more than 200 km eastwards of the sites @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "volcanic activity ceased in the area of the observatories more than 20 million years ago .",
    "the volcanic region of the central andes is the largest in the world and it also contains the highest active volcanoes , such as llullaillaco volcano ( 6723 m.a.s.l . ) . unlike the low viscosity - high temperature magmas of hawaii , the high viscosity and low temperature of the magmas in the central andes generate explosive eruptions that eject large eruptive columns",
    "seismic hazard is definied as the probabilistic measure of ground shaking associated to the recurrence of earthquakes .",
    "seismic hazard maps depict the levels of chosen ground motions that likely will be exceeded in specified exposure times .",
    "hazard asessment for buildings and other structures commonly specifies 10% chance of exceedance of some ground motion parameter for an exposure time of 50 years , corresponding to a return period of 475 years .",
    "the operational and survival conditions of telescope structures will depend on the ground shaking level ( seismic hazard ) and the seismic design of the structure .",
    "thus , two sites with different levels of seismic hazard will need different seismic designs for the structures to reach the same survival conditions . in this sense ,",
    "larger seismic hazard means increased building costs @xcite .    assessing seismic hazard",
    "is the first step in evaluating seismic risk , obtained by convolving seismic hazard with local site effects ( topography , geology , amplifications due to soil conditions , ... ) and vulnerability factors ( buildings and infrastructures , populations , date and time , ... ) .",
    "the basic elements of modern probabilistic seismic hazard are : ( 1 ) compilation of uniform seismic databases for historical ( pre-1900 ) , early instrumental ( 1900 - 1964 ) and instrumental ( 1964-present ) periods ; ( 2 ) implementation of a seismic source model to describe the spatial - temporal distribution of earthquakes , using evidence from earthquake catalogues , seismo - tectonics , paleoseismology , geomorphology , active faults , crustal deformation , among others ; ( 3 ) evaluation of ground shaking as a function of earthquake size and distance ; ( 4 ) computation of the seismic harzard as the probability of ocurrence of ground shaking in a given time period , to produce maps of seismic hazard . in order to assign a common methodology to infer the probabilistic seismic hazard to the different sites",
    ", the data from the global seismic hazard assessment program ( gshap ) were analyzed .",
    "gshap ( http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/gshap/global/ ) was launched in 1992 by the international litosphere program and implemented in the period 1992 - 1999 to promote a global homogeneous approach to seismic hazard evaluation @xcite .",
    "gshap hazard maps depicts peak - ground - acceleration ( pga ) with 10 % chance of exceedance in 50 years , as illustrated in figures 6 to 8 and summarized in table 1 .",
    "although all the sites are located within active volcanic / tectonic regions , seismic activity strongly depends on the geological setting and thus , significant differences in seismicity are expected .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in the distribution of epicenters recorded by the national earthquake information center ( neic ) , http://neic.usgs.gov , for the period 1973 to 2008 ( figures 1 to 5 ) .",
    "seismic hazard for the canary islands is slightly higher than that reported by the gshap in the basis of recent results . in this sense , recent analysis of historical records revealed that earthquakes with intensities of viii msk took place during volcanic eruptions in cumbre vieja , la palma and the eruptions of 1704 - 1705 closer to mount izaa in tenerife @xcite .",
    "moreover , the focal mechanism of the m=5.2 earthquake recorded in 1989 may 9 ( the largest earthquake registered in the canaries ) and the aftershock distribution agreeded with the strike of a submarine fault parallel to the eastern coast of tenerife @xcite .",
    "hence , the activity of this fault and the effect of volcanic activity should be included in the hazard calculation , increasing the pga from 0.15 m / s@xmath1 to 0.56 m / s@xmath1 ( 0.06 g ) for eastern tenerife ( including el teide observatory ) and 0.5 m / s@xmath1 ( 0.05 g ) for the rest of the islands . in any case , following the convention of the gshap , seismic hazard at the canary islands remains at the lowest level .    the high rate of earthquake occurrence , coupled with the potential for large events , places hawaii among the areas of highest seismic hazard ( figures 4 and 6 ) .",
    "earthquakes are relatively common within the hawaiian islands , particularly on the island of hawaii , as the result of the crustal stresses imparted by the volcanic activity , in particular in kilauea and mauna loa volcanoes .",
    "moreover , the weight of the island has buckled the earth s crust and isostatic adjustements often occur to establish gravitational equilibrium . the earthquakes of 2006 october 15 were caused by isostatic response to the stresses generated in the crust and mantle by the weight of the island .",
    "the seismic activity near the chilean sites of paranal and cerro ventarrones ( figures 5 and 7 ) results from the release of stresses generated by the subduction of the oceanic nazca plate beneath the south american plate .",
    "the focal mechanisms of these earthquakes indicate subduction - related thrusting , likely on the interface between these two plates , as illustrated by the relationship between the location of the hypocentres and the distance from the peru - chile trench ( the longer the distance the deeper the location of the hypocentres ) . there is a seismic gap",
    "( there have not been recorded large earthquakes ) between latitudes 18@xmath0s and 22s@xmath0s ( see fig .",
    "5 ) that mark the zones of the 1868 august 14 ( m=9 ) southern peru and the 1877 may 9 ( m=9 ) northern chile earthquakes @xcite .",
    "since the estimated recurrence time for large earthquakes ranges between 111 to 264 years @xcite , these regions are likely to experience a large earthquake in the future .",
    ".seismic hazard expressed in terms of the peak ground acceleration ( pga ) with 10% chance of exceedance for an exposure time of 50 years .",

    "a common methodology was used to characterize the geological hazard , expressed in terms of probabilities of occurrence in the next 50 years , recalling that this period of time corresponds to the expected lifetime of a telescope .",
    "large telescopes have to withstand the effects associated to seismic activity , but they also have to minimize the loss of operational time , recalling the extreme precision in the alignment of mechanical and optical components . the hazard from lava flows is the damage or destruction by burying , crushing or burning astronomical facilities in their paths .",
    "burial by ash / tephra could collapse roofs , break power and communication lines , whereas suspension of fine - grained particles in air affects visibility , could damage unprotected machinery , cause short circuits in electrial facilities and affect comunications .",
    "tectonic and/or volcanic activity might also induce subtle ground tilt that could also result in the disalignment of mechanical and optical components , in particular in the case of interferometric observations .",
    "the lowest geological hazard in both seismic and volcanic activity was found at roque de los muchachos observatory , in the island of la palma .",
    "seismic hazard is also low at the other canarian site , el teide observatory , since seismic activity in the canary islands is low in both number and magnitude of earthquakes . on the contrary",
    ", seismic hazard is very high in paranal and ventarrones ( chile ) and in mauna kea ( hawaii ) .",
    "hazard associated to lava flows during a volcanic eruption is not significant at any site , as the result of low volcanic activity in the regions where the sites are emplaced , topographical protection or distance to the eruptive vents .",
