    "since the discovery nearly 25 years ago of the sio molecule in orion ( snyder & buhl 1974 ) , sio masers have been observed in the envelopes of hundreds of late - type stars , and in the direction of a few galactic hii regions .",
    "orion remains a unique source of sio emission because it contains all known sio isotopic species and because it is the only star - forming region exhibiting a very strong maser in the @xmath1 transition .",
    "the strong and compact @xmath3 sio maser is associated with the luminous infrared source irc2 and is closely connected with the extended and weaker @xmath2 maser emission mapped at 43 ghz ( chandler & de pree 1995 ) and 86 ghz ( wright et al . 1995 ) .",
    "recent high resolution observations showed that irc2 is a complex object resolved into four components ( dougados et al .",
    "1993 ) and that the center of the strong ( @xmath3 ) and weak ( @xmath2 ) sio maser outflows coincide with the radio continuum source i ( menten & reid 1995 , wright et al .",
    "1995 ) , and is displaced from the center of the molecular hot core ( lying to the east of source i ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the center of the large - scale high velocity bipolar outflow traced by co lies roughly @xmath7 to the north of source i.    considerable efforts have been made to properly model the sio maser phenomenon in late - type stars .",
    "models include radiative and/or collisional excitation schemes ( e.g. kwan & scoville 1974 , elitzur 1980 , langer & watson 1984 , lockett & elitzur 1992 or bujarrabal 1994 ) .",
    "all models share two general characteristics : @xmath8 they require high volumic densities of order @xmath9 @xmath10 ; @xmath11 inversion of the sio level populations depends on the column density , and maser emission in higher vibrational states peaks at higher values of the column density . on the other hand , there are major observational facts that can not be explained by any of the present radiative / collisional sio pumping schemes",
    ". in particular , the `` standard '' pumping schemes fail to explain in stars the peculiar distribution of line intensities within a given vibrational state ( e.g. cernicharo & bujarrabal 1993 ) , and fail to explain the absence or weakness of @xmath12 emission from orion and late - type stars ( olofsson et al .",
    "1981 b , bujarrabal et al . 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , line overlaps among transitions of the isotopic species of silicon monoxide are an important addition to radiative / collisional pumping in stars ( e.g. gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo 1997 ) , while the line overlap between two near infrared lines of sio and water explains the weakness of the @xmath12 transition ( bujarrabal et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "depending on the relative importance of property @xmath11 above ( namely various @xmath4 state masers should peak in different spatial regions ) with respect to line overlap effects among nearby transitions of sio and isotopes the spatial distribution of various vibrational transitions should differ or not .",
    "therefore , high spatial resolution and sensitive maps of sio and isotopes should provide a test of these predictions .",
    "with this idea in mind we have compared the spatial distributions of two nearby transitions of and toward orion irc2 which contains the strongest sio source in the sky . in sect .",
    "2 we present our observations and give details of data reduction . in sect .",
    "3 we discuss spectral variability and present our maps of and emission from orion . in sect .  4 we discuss some properties of the apparent ring of and masers , the relative spatial extents of both species and implications on their excitation .",
    "some conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "in order to compare the relative spatial distributions of the main ( ) and rare isotope ( ) emissions we need a relative positional accuracy better than the extent of the main isotope emission , @xmath13 . for this kind of accuracy simultaneous observations of two different transitions are appropriate .",
    "we thus searched for nearby frequencies involving rotational levels not too high in energy .",
    "the frequencies of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions of and ( 85.75913 and 86.24337 ghz ) differ by less than the 500 mhz instantaneous bandwidth of the interferometer and can thus be simultaneously observed .",
    "observations of these two lines in orion irc2 were made on august 19 and 21 , 1995 and march 5 , 1996 with four antennas of the iram array on plateau de bure ( see guilloteau et al .",
    "1992 for details ) . in 1995",
    "we used configuration b2 with antennas on stations n17 e24 w09 w12 and spacings covering 24 to 288 m. the synthesized beam was around @xmath14 .",
    "higher spatial resolution was achieved in 1996 with antennas on stations n29 e24 w20 w27 corresponding to spacings from 56 to 408 m and resulting in @xmath15 resolution .",
    "the independent correlator units of the interferometer were used as follows . the @xmath16 and @xmath1 lines of and were placed in two 20 mhz sub - bands centered at 113.75 mhz and 596.25 mhz , respectively .",
    "the frequency separation between adjacent spectral channels was 78.1  khz , or 0.27 km s@xmath17 . in 1995 , for redundancy , the @xmath2 line was also observed in a 40 mhz wide sub - band .",
    "broad band continuum observations with three or two 160 mhz units were performed simultaneously .",
    "[ tbh ]    = 8.5 cm    in this project we have mapped the and line emissions using one of the strongest features of the main isotopic species to self - calibrate all data .",
    "therefore , a careful bandpass calibration was required across the entire bandwidth since the maximum frequency separation between extreme features of both species is around 496 mhz . to this end",
    "we observed strong calibrators , 3c454.3 , 3c273 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 . in 1995 our best results were obtained with 3c454.3 which we observed just before a long run in orion .",
    "although we do not expect a priori any short time - scale variations of the bandpass shape , we used a different scheme in 1996 .",
    "observations of orion were interspersed with those of the bandpass calibrator @xmath19 .",
    "nearby phase calibrators were not essential for this project since we self - calibrate the data on one of the main spectral features .",
    "the bandpass calibrators were used to calibrate the flux density scale . at 86 ghz",
    "we adopted 6.5 and 10 jy for 3c454.3 ( 1995 august observations ) and @xmath19 ( 1996 march observations ) , respectively .",
    "although the flux density for @xmath19 was uncertain because it was highly time variable in 1995 and 1996 , we averaged our measurements of the antenna temperature to jy conversion factor for both observing periods and adopted s / t = 24 jy / k .",
    "data reduction was performed with the clic package ( lucas 1996 ) .",
    "the sky was clear during the observations and little editing was necessary . however , we discarded some of the 1995 data when orion was too low on the horizon .",
    "the bandpass solutions were determined by fitting the complex gains in several sub - bands ; these solutions were applied to the line data base . in 1995 each day was treated separately .",
    "[ t ] @xmath20phase noise due to finite signal to noise ratio ; the corresponding position error is @xmath21 .",
    "+ @xmath22typical total bandpass phase noise ; the channel to channel if noise is negligible and less than 0.1 degree .",
    "+ @xmath23maximum phase shift between and sub - bands ; one degree phase shift corresponds to 4.4 mas with 1.6 \" synthesized beam .",
    "[ erreur ] to improve the phase stability we determined accurate baseline solutions and we applied the known antenna axis corrections .",
    "the phase residuals lied in the range @xmath24 and @xmath25 degrees for the 1995 and 1996 observations , respectively .",
    "we then mapped the and line emissions using the task uv_ascal and one strong feature of the main isotope to self - calibrate all other features .",
    "accordingly , we are insensitive to atmospheric phase fluctuations and to any systematic errors left in the baseline calibration .",
    "the position accuracy within the and spot maps is limited by finite signal to noise ratio and by imperfect bandpass calibration ( see table 1 ) . in practice ,",
    "the position errors within our maps lie around @xmath26 milliarc sec ( mas ) in ra and @xmath27 mas in declination .",
    "this allows us to discuss the long - term stability of the velocity pattern observed for both isotopes , as well as the long - term stability of the emission ring discussed in sect .",
    "when one compares the relative positions of the and emissions , the relative phase shift of the two and sub - bands can not be neglected ( table 1 ) ; we found a maximum drift of 1 degree per hour for the march 1996 observations . because we regularly calibrated the bandpass in 1996 , the position error between both isotopic species due to phase shift between sub - bands was less than 5 mas .",
    "this error is estimated to be about ten times higher in our data of 1995 august due to much less time spent in bandpass calibration . in sect .",
    "4.4 , we only discuss the relative positions of both isotopic species observed in 1996 .",
    "the overall relative to position uncertainty is of order 5 - 8 mas .",
    "the v=0 line at 85.759 ghz was discovered in orion by olofsson ( 1981 a ) who observed narrow and time variable features .",
    "the maser nature of this emission is well demonstrated here because we detect narrow spectral emission of same intensity with all baselines of the array .",
    "@xmath2 emission will be discussed further in sect .",
    "4.2 and is essentially unresolved with the iram connected array ( see below , however ) .",
    "in addition , we observe spectral variability over the 6.5 months period of our two observing sessions since both the line shape and relative peak intensities clearly changed with time ( fig .",
    "[ variable29sio ] ) .",
    "the emission spectrum consists of two main features in the velocity range @xmath28 and @xmath29 km s@xmath17 .",
    "this is similar to the emission range although and emission profiles are much different , a fact which can partly be related to differences in the degree of saturation of both masers .",
    "there is weak emission in the intermediate velocity range @xmath30 km s@xmath17 .",
    "this emission is about 20 times weaker than in , and is detected with all baselines of the array .",
    "however , with the 24-m long baseline available in 1995 , the emission lying between the two main features was nearly 5 times stronger than for all other longer baselines .",
    "we conclude that for this baseline there was a blend of quasi - thermal and maser emission . both maser emission and quasi - thermal emission",
    "were also observed in the @xmath2 state of the more abundant species ( chandler & de pree 1995 , and wright et al .",
    "1995 for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 transitions , respectively ) .",
    "wright et al . showed that the @xmath2 maser component extends over @xmath33 although it is closely connected with the @xmath34 compact masers . on the other hand ,",
    "their @xmath2 low spatial resolution maps are more sensitive to thermal emission and show a connection with the high velocity bipolar co outflow ( @xmath35 in size ) . for all spectra and data discussed in this work we restricted the analysis to @xmath36 distances greater than about 50 m and 25 m for our observations of 1996 march and 1995 august , respectively .",
    "we were thus insensitive to structures extending over @xmath37 .",
    "[ 29siorelatmap ] shows the relative positions of @xmath38 maser spots observed in 1996 .",
    "we used the strong @xmath1 maser feature at 15.6 km s@xmath17 to self - calibrate these data ( cf .",
    "2 ) , and we verified that selection of a specific reference feature was not critical . the @xmath2 emission is distributed along two ridges of positive and negative velocities as for ( compare fig .",

    "the 20 to 30 mas change between the two ridges observed in 1995 and 1996 seems real because it is greater than the typical relative position error of the individual features . at both epochs of observations",
    "the data were acquired with non rotating antenna feeds sensitive to vertical polarization only .",
    "however , we are not affected by polarization effects because we have verified that our relative spot maps were nearly identical when we analyzed the data over short periods with a small range of paralactic angle .",

    "all maps show similarities .",
    "there are , however , minor but obvious changes among the different maps including changes for the weak high velocity features which seem to have moved during the period 1995 january to 1995 august and 1996 march . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean distance between the main negative and positive velocity features remains stable . for our 1996 observations we measured a separation of 0.16 `` , a value very close to that deduced from our 1995 results and earlier iram results , and consistent with the bima array results ( see discussion in sect .",

    "menten & reid ( 1995 ) found that the centroid of the sio maser distribution coincides with the radio continuum source , i , lying on the southern edge of the complex source irc2 .",
    "[ tbh ]    = 8.5 cm",
    "the regular position@xmath43velocity pattern of @xmath1 emission ( plambeck et al . 1990 , wright et al .",
    "1995 ) was interpreted by plambeck et al . as a collection of maser clumps lying in an expanding and rotating disk .",
    "this pattern does not change much with time and has been observed with the iram interferometer in 1990 ( guilloteau et al .",
    "1992 ) , 1992 ( baudry et al . 1995 ) , and 1995 and 1996 ( this work ) .",
    "a similar position@xmath43velocity pattern was also observed in the @xmath45 transition of sio around 43 ghz by morita ( 1992 ) and menten & reid ( 1995 ) .",
    "we can estimate the long - term stability of the 86 ghz pattern by measuring the mean separation between the two ridges delineated by the dominant positive and negative velocity features of orion irc2 . to this end , we have used the 6 different maps made at 86 ghz with the bima and iram interferometers ( plambeck et al .",

    "therefore , any apparent contraction or expansion of the ring , would be less than or of order @xmath47yr , namely @xmath48 au / yr at the 480 pc distance of orion a. on the other hand , stability of the intermediate velocity pattern ( @xmath49 km s@xmath17 ) is not obvious when we compare our 1990 data with the present iram maps . the complex shape observed in 1995 or 1996",
    "is not quite similar to that in 1990 ( see fig . 11 in guilloteau et al .",
    "such differences can not be due to relative position errors which are less than about 2 to 5 mas in the maps .",
    "these discrepancies seem to agree with the model of plambeck et al .",
    "( 1990 ) which predicts that intensity changes in the intermediate velocity features could cause large position changes of the maser spots in the disk .",
    "the high velocity features lying around @xmath50 km s@xmath17 are located close to the positive velocities of the sio ring ( see e.g. the 29.2 and 29.1 km s@xmath17 features in figs .",
    "[ relat28map ] and [ relat2829map ] ) .",
    "our observations of 1995 august show that these features are excited in an area similar , although not identical , to that observed in 1995 january by wright et al .",
    "( 1995 , see their fig .",
    "1c ) for their @xmath51 km s@xmath17 features .",
    "however , 6.5 months later our data show that the @xmath52 km s@xmath17 features have migrated toward the most positive velocity end of the main sio emission ridge ( see location of the 29.1 km s@xmath17 component in fig.[relat2829map ] ) .",
    "the apparent migration of weak high velocity components is consistent with the model of plambeck ( 1990 ) where small changes in brightness distribution of extended features may look like rapid motion .",
    "nevertheless , such rapid motions should be confirmed in future maps of emission .",
    "these high velocity features could be related to the spectral changes observed for the same components ; they could be weakly masing as suggested in sect .",
    "it is interesting to note that anomalous gas motion beyond the expansion velocity of the ring of maser clumps could perhaps explain the high velocity components .",
    "such components are reminiscent of the weak features observed in the line wings of emission from late type stars ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1997 , herpin et al .",
    "sio line wing emission in stars is related to bipolar gas outflows and to pulsations of the underlying star .",
    "[ t ]    = 8.5 cm    [ tbh ]    = 8.5 cm      time variability as well as notable changes in the line profile ( fig .",
    "[ variable29sio ] ) are clearly in favour of maser emission .",
    "short - term variability in the excitation of the molecule is suggested by our maps because the mean distance observed in 1996 between the two ridges of emission , @xmath53 , is significantly larger than the @xmath40 measured in 1995 .",
    "this fact indicates non thermal processes in the excitation of .",
    "in addition , the relatively high flux density observed in 1995 and 1996 suggests also non thermal emission . the array can not give the size of the individual features , but we may use the synthesized beamwidth and the observed peak flux density to estimate a minimum brightness temperature . in march 1996 the flux density peaks around 37 jy and we derive @xmath54 k. this temperature is greatly above the kinetic temperature usually adopted in orion , @xmath55 k , and is another indication for maser emission although high temperatures would be plausible in a shocked environment .",
    "however , for some of the weaker features in the range @xmath56 we obtain t@xmath57 k , and could thus be part thermal and part maser .",
    "the actual spatial structure of the @xmath2 emission is complex , and we recall that fig . [ 29siorelatmap ] does not show all of the emission detectable with the array . by discarding the shorter baselines ( sect .",
    "3.1 ) , we have concentrated our analysis on more compact emission sources .",
    "we were not able here to map the @xmath2 emission counterpart to the extended @xmath2 emission seen by wright et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .      the relative distribution of and emission observed in 1996 is shown in fig . [ relat2829map ] and in fig . [ relat2829mapbis ]",
    "where , for clarity , we have not given the velocities .",
    "the two ridges of @xmath38 emission ( dotted circles ) and @xmath58 emission ( full circles ) are clearly visible on these figures .",
    "our data do not show a complete spatial overlap as well as a close correlation among features of both species although in both cases the positive velocities lie to the nw of the negative features .",
    "another clear difference between and is that there is no obvious pattern for the intermediate velocity features ( fig .",
    "[ 29siorelatmap ] or fig .",
    "[ relat2829map ] ) ; this could be related to mixed thermal and masing features as suggested in the previous section .",
    "[ relat2829map ] shows that velocities in the range @xmath59",
    "km s@xmath17 tend to be found in the same area for both species although it is not possible to make an exact position - velocity pairing of the and features . in fig .",
    "[ relat2829mapbis ] the northern ridges of both and seem to be co - aligned and are not coincident .",
    "we can not exclude , however , that uncorrected instrumental effects still affect our relative map and these observations should be repeated using frequent bandpass calibrations as used in 1996 . in order to force the spatial coincidence of the main features in both species",
    "we have shifted the main features lying around 16 km s@xmath17 on top of the features in the range @xmath60 km s@xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , the negative velocity emission ridge appears well outside the negative velocity ridge .",
    "any rotation of coordinates axis around the 16 km s@xmath17 features does not improve the spatial coincidence of both species .",
    "hence , we conclude that both isotopic species are not excited in the same gas layers .",
    "this is strengthened by the analysis of our 1995 data which similarly show no spatial coincidence and a smaller distance between the two ridges of emission for than for .",
    "we note that a similar picture also emerges from the 43 ghz interferometric observations made by morita et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in orion .",
    "although their observations of the @xmath61 and @xmath62 transitions were not made simultaneously and were less sensitive than here , the mean separation between the two ridges of emission is slightly smaller for @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) than for @xmath3 ( @xmath65 in agreement with the separation measured on the 43 ghz map of menten & reid 1995 ) .",
    "the 43 ghz observations , the maps of @xmath3 and @xmath2 emission ( wright et al . 1995 ) and our 86 ghz maps indicate that different vibrational states of silicon monoxide do show a close connection but do not exactly coincide .",
    "we comment below on possible explanations of the observed similarities without exact co - location of ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 ) maser sources .",
    "first , the silicon monoxide reservoir seems identical for both isotopic species since their large - scale spatial distributions are alike .",
    "this is expected if shocks generated in the expanding flow traced by the @xmath1 masers enhance the sputtering of silicon which will then react quickly in the gas phase to form both and .",
    "second , differences in the small - scale spatial distributions of and could simply result from differences in the excitation of both species or from different physical conditions within the silicon monoxide cloud .",
    "sio pumping models do not require any isotopic differentiation to obtain , or @xmath66sio maser sources .",
    "in all cases the general physical conditions are grossly similar for one isotopic species or another apart from the total column densities . on the other hand ,",
    "all radiative / collisional pumping models show that different @xmath4 state masers peak in different spatial regions .",
    "we believe that this fact , combined with different degrees of saturation in the and masers , is essential to explain the slightly different distribution of ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 ) maser spots .",
    "our maps of relative and emission also show that some features from both isotopes and with different velocities tend to be excited in the same area .",
    "this is observed in the range @xmath67 km s@xmath17 .",
    "collisional pumping with high temperature ( @xmath68 k ) and high molecular hydrogen density ( @xmath69 @xmath10 ) provides a range of column densities where both @xmath3 and @xmath63 , @xmath70 masers are excited ( lockett & elitzur 1992 ) .",
    "such a scheme does not apply to our apparently overlapping ( @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath3 ) 86 ghz features because their velocities are not in good agreement .",
    "however , further observations should be conducted to investigate the detailed kinematics and stability of the emission .",
    "line overlap effects among various transitions of silicon monoxide can not be ignored to explain the excitation of this molecule .",
    "first , _ local _ line overlaps due to turbulence play a role as soon as the velocity dispersion reaches about 5 . limiting ourselves to the lower @xmath71 values , we find that 10 to 15 ro - vibrational transitions of , and overlap within 5 for @xmath72 and 1 .",
    "if local line overlaps would dominate the excitation of low @xmath71 rotational levels in orion , we would expect exact spatial coincidence of the isotopic species . our and maps contradict this idea .",
    "second , _ non - local _ line overlap effects as described by gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo ( 1997 ) in a non static circumstellar environment are most important . the relative distribution of and",
    "emission in our maps is not inconsistent with such non - local line overlaps .",
    "in addition , it is also plausible that the overlap between two near infrared lines of water and ( olofsson et al . 1981 b ) is an important excitation process of silicon monoxide in orion .",
    "analysing the spatial extents of different @xmath4 state masers is clearly important to better understand the pumping mechanisms of the sio molecule .",
    "this kind of work should be extended to strong stellar sio - emitters since the physical conditions in late - type stars and orion are so different .",
