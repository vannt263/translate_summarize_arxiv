    "the question arises as to whether these observations are reliable and compatible with the current @xmath0cdm model .",
    "some lenses provide much stronger and more certain constraints on the small scale structure than others .",
    "i try to take a conservative approach here and consider only the lenses that provide clean , relatively unambiguous constraints .",
    "the standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model will have the cosmological parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and a scale free initial power spectrum .",
    "there are essentially four ways that have been proposed for detecting substructure in multiply imaged qso lenses .",
    "they are briefly described here .",
    "it was proposed by @xcite that the missing cdm substructure could be searched for by comparing the flux ratios of 4-image qso lenses with those predicted by lens models .",
    "simulations showed that if the substructure has a small mass scale the image positions can be used to constrain the host , smooth lens model .",
    "it was subsequently shown that the magnification ratios of observed lenses generically do not agree with simple lens models ( @xcite ) .",
    "these anomalies are probably the result of substructure ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kochanek & dalal ( 2003 ) ) for some arguments ) , but when interpreting the results degeneracies in the lens models become a problem .",
    "more complicated lens models can fit the image positions just as well and give different predictions for the magnification ratios . to actually measure properties of these substructures",
    "a more precise method is required .",
    "it can be shown that if the source is close to a cusp in the caustic of a sufficiently smooth lenses three of the images will be clustered together and the magnifications of the close triplet will sum to zero ; taking the parity reversed images to have negative magnification ( ) . to make this prediction independent of the intrinsic luminosity of the qso the images in the triplet are labeled a through c and the cusp caustic parameter , @xmath8 , is defined as @xmath9 which should be zero if the lens map is sufficiently smooth .",
    "small scale structure on approximately the scale of the image separations will cause @xmath8 to differ from zero fairly independently of the form of the rest of the lens ( @xcite ) .",
    "the five well observed cusp caustic lenses all show violations of the magnification relation at some level .",
    "two of these are only measured in the optical / near - ir where microlensing by stars could be important .",
    "the three with @xmath8 measured in the radio ( b0712 + 472 , b2045 + 265 and b1422 + 231 ) clearly violate the relation although b1422 + 231 is less clear than the others . in section  [ sec :",
    "results ] ( and in @xcite ) the significance of these violations is investigated .",
    "it was proposed by @xcite that much of the lens model degeneracy can be removed and the sensitivity to substructure properties improved by utilizing the fact that the different emission regions of the source qso have different physical sizes .",
    "if the lens is smooth on the scales that bridge the sizes of the emission regions , the magnification of those regions should be the same and thus the magnification ratios should be the same .",
    "the visible and near - infrared ( near - ir ) continuum emission regions are small ( @xmath10 100  au ) and their magnification can be affected by microlensing by ordinary stars in the lens galaxy . the broad line emission region is @xmath11 in size and is less affected by microlensing in most cases .",
    "the radio and mid - ir regions are @xmath12 ; their magnification will be dominated by larger scales than stars .",
    "the narrow line emission region is even larger , @xmath13 .",
    "the magnification ratios in these bands and lines can be compared to constrain the mass , concentration and number density of substructures .",
    "@xcite found that the narrow line magnification ratios do not agree with the radio and mid - ir ratios ( although the radio and mid - ir ratios do agree with each other ) in the lens q2237 + 0305 .",
    "it was shown in that paper that at least a few % of the surface density of the lens needs to be in substructure of mass @xmath14 to explain this mismatch .",
    "this result is not consistent with the present @xmath0cdm predictions in that it requires too much mass in very small mass halos either inside the lens of somewhere along the line of sight .",
    "however , these predictions could be significantly underestimating the amount of substructure because of numerical effects in the simulations ( see j. taylor , these proceedings ) .",
    "it is also possible to look for substructure by comparing the curvature , on milliarcsecond scales , of multiply imaged radio jets ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* metcalf & madau 2001 ) ) .",
    "there is some evidence that the bends in the jets of b1152 + 199 are not compatible with a smooth lens , but the case is not yet water tight ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* metcalf 2002 ) ) .",
    "numerical simulations are necessary to calculate the expected influence of small scale structure on the magnification ratios .",
    "generally there are multiple small halos affecting a single image , the size of the source ( in the radio , mid - ir or narrow lines ) is significant compared to the sizes of the substructures and the effect of a single substructure on multiple images must be considered .",
    "any massive object near the line of sight inside or outside of the primary lens could potentially contribute .",
    "both contributions have been simulated , but here we concentrated on the extragalactic part .",
    "the simulation method is more thoroughly discussed in @xcite .",
    "here it is briefly outlined .",
    "the large number of small halos and the large range in size scales , from the size of the primary lens ( @xmath15 ) to the size of the source ( @xmath16 for the broad line emission region ) , make finding the images and calculating magnifications challenging and time consuming . an adaptive mesh refinement technique is used to overcome these problems .",
    "the entire lens is simulated at once in all cases .    for extragalactic halos the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism",
    "is used to calculate the mass function from which a random sample of halos is drawn . in this mass regime",
    "the ps mass function differs very little from the sheth - tormen mass function .",
    "the structure of these halos is taken to be of the nfw form truncated at the virial radius .",
    "the initial power spectrum is taken to be scale invariant and normalized to @xmath6 .",
    "the concentrations of the halos are set according to @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in agreement with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zentner & bullock ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "in addition to the substructure , a model for the host lens must be chosen .",
    "a sie + external shear model is used in these simulations .",
    "the lensing results can change significantly when @xmath20 or @xmath21 is changed .",
    "and the one on the right is for @xmath22 .",
    "there is no substructure inside the primary lens . ]",
    "simulations were performed to mimic the observed lenses with the addition of @xmath0cdm halos .",
    "the resulting combinations of image magnifications are then compared with those observed to determine if the observed anomalies are expected to be reasonably common in this cosmological model or unlikely .    to represent lenses in the einstein cross configuration",
    ", a host lens model is constructed that fits the image positions of q2237 + 0305 .",
    "the effects of substructure within the host lens and its contributions to _ spectroscopic lensing _ were investigated in @xcite . only the extragalactic contribution to _",
    "monochromatic _ magnification ratios is discussed here .",
    "figure  [ fig : spread_ratio ] shows a cumulative distribution of the largest discrepancy ( in magnitudes ) between the smooth model predictions and simulated values for the three magnification ratios .",
    "the source size is 1  pc in this case .",
    "most of the anomalies are caused by the high end of the mass distribution , @xmath23 .",
    "one can see that these discrepancies are rather large even without any substructure in the host lens itself  discrepancies as large as @xmath24 are expected in half the cases .",
    "the typical discrepancies between observed flux ratios and models are a few tenths of a magnitude ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the observed _ monochromatic _ ratio anomalies consistent with @xmath0cdm , simple lens models and no substructure internal to the primary lenses .",
    "@xmath0cdm halos seem easily capable of changing the monochromatic magnification ratios by this much , but they do not produce the mismatch in the magnifications of different size sources as seen by @xcite . this problem can be traced to a deficiency of small mass ( @xmath25 ) halos in the @xmath0cdm model .    , for lens b1422 + 231 with only extragalactic standard @xmath0cdm small - scale structure .",
    "the observed value in the radio with error is shown as the hashed region .",
    "the different curves correspond to the halos mass ranges shown .",
    "it can be seen that most of the changes in @xmath8 are caused by relatively large mass halos , @xmath26 .",
    "there is about a 25% chance of @xmath8 differing from zero by more than is observed . ]    to investigate violations of the cusp caustic relation simulations were done for several models designed to mimic observed lenses .",
    "figure  [ fig : r_prob1422 ] shows the distribution of @xmath8 for b1422 + 231 with the expected population of extragalactic halos only .",
    "the first thing to note is the marked asymmetry in the distribution . as previously seen ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* metcalf 2001 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* matcalf & madau 2001 ) ; @xcite ) , the magnifications of negative magnification images are affected by substructure differently than positive magnification images . when substructure is added , @xmath8 is biased toward positive values .    also shown in figure  [ fig : r_prob1422 ] is the observed value of @xmath8 for comparison .",
    "there is a perfectly reasonable probability of @xmath27 that @xmath8 would be even larger than the observed value . by comparing the two different ranges for the halo masses",
    ", it can be seen that violations in the cusp caustic relation are mostly caused by more massive halos in this case . in light of this , the violation of the cusp caustic relation in b1422 + 472 seems fully consistent with the @xmath0cdm model even without substructure within the halo of the primary lens",
    ".    we can also compare figure  [ fig : r_prob1422 ] to lens b0712 + 472 which has a similar configuration to b1422 + 231 although a lower source redshift .",
    "it is easily seen that its value of @xmath28 is not particularly unlikely ( there is a @xmath29 probability of it being larger ) and thus does not require an additional explanation beyond the expected population of extragalactic halos .",
    "lens b2045 + 265 is a more extreme cusp caustic case .",
    "figure  [ fig : r_prob2045cosmic ] shows the results for simulations with just extragalactic @xmath0cdm halos . with a halo mass range of @xmath30 the observed @xmath8 does not appear strongly disfavored  @xmath31 chance of it being larger . considering the additional substructure within the host lens ,",
    "the observed @xmath8 seems perfectly consistent with @xmath0cdm .     in the tight long axis case like b2045 + 265 with only extragalactic substructure .",
    "the observed value of @xmath8 in the radio is shown by the hashed region .",
    "the included halo mass ranges are shown.,height=288 ]",
    "it has been shown here that anomalies in the monochromatic ( as opposed to differential ) magnification ratios of cusp caustic lenses can all be explained naturally within the @xmath0cdm model with little if any substructure within the dark matter halo of the primary lenses .",
    "extragalactic halos are enough to account for these anomalies .",
    "furthermore , the typical observed anomalies in the monochromatic magnification ratios of several tenths of a magnitude  when compared to simple lens models  are easily explained in the same way .",
    "the contribution to flux anomalies from extragalactic halos is found to be significant . measuring the amount of substructure that is within the primary lens halos for comparison with nbody simulations will require a large number of lenses and an accurate prediction for the extragalactic contribution .",
    "the extragalactic population of halos with masses @xmath32 has not been directly observed either , even in the relatively local universe .",
    "the anomalies in the monochromatic magnification ratios could also be explained by smaller scale structures than cansidered here since they do not provide significant constraints on the substructure mass .",
    "it is significant that all of the observed cusp caustic parameters , @xmath8 , are positive . in light of the marked asymmetry in the distributions of @xmath8 from the simulations ,",
    "the positive values can be seen as further support for the conclusion that these anomalies are being caused by some kind of small scale structure .",
    "in contrast to the monochromatic magnification ratios , the spectroscopic gravitational lensing observations of q2237 + 0305 require more small mass halos than are expected in the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "bent multiply imaged radio jets also hint , although less securely , at a large number of small mass objects .",
    "the case for small mass substructure is not yet secure , but further data should resolve the issue . on the theoretical side ,",
