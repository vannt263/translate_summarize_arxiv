    "<S> we prove that the brst complex of a topological conformal field theory is a homotopy gerstenhaber algebra , as conjectured by lian and zuckerman in 1992 . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest a refinement of the original conjecture for topological vertex operator algebras . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the usefulness of our main tools , operads and `` string vertices '' by obtaining new results on vassiliev invariants of knots and double loop spaces .                </S>",
    "<S> two - dimensional topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) at its most elementary level is the theory of @xmath0-graded commutative associative algebras ( with some additional structure ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it came as something of a surprise when several groups of mathematicians realized that the physical state space of a 2d tqft has the structure of a @xmath0-graded lie algebra , relative to a new grading equal to the old grading minus one . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the commutative and lie products fit together nicely to give the structure of a gerstenhaber algebra ( g - algebra ) , a @xmath0-graded poisson algebra for which the poisson bracket has degree @xmath1 ( see section [ g ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this g - algebra structure is best understood in the framework of 2d topological conformal field theories ( tcfts ) ( see section [ tcft ] ) wherein operads of moduli spaces of riemann surfaces play a fundamental role .    </S>",
    "<S> g - algebras arose explicitly in m. gerstenhaber s work on the hochschild cohomology theory for associative algebras ( see section  [ g ] for this and several other contexts for the theory of g - algebras ) . </S>",
    "<S> operads arose in the work of j. stasheff , gerstenhaber and later work of p. may on the recognition problem for iterated loop spaces . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , f. cohen discovered that the homology of a double loop space is naturally a g - algebra , see section  [ g ] ; in fact , a double loop space is naturally an algebra over the little disks operad employed by cohen and also boardman and vogt , see section  [ double ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( the reader should consult the article @xcite by may in these proceedings . )    in joint work , b. lian and g. zuckerman ( see also the joint work of m. penkava and a. schwarz ) discovered the above - mentioned g - algebra structure in the context of topological vertex operator algebras ( tvoas ) ( see section [ tvoa ] ) , which are a powerful algebraic starting point for the construction of 2d topological conformal field theories . </S>",
    "<S> lian and zuckerman also gave a number of concrete constructions of various examples of tvoas , tcfts and g - algebras .    in an attempt to understand lian - zuckerman s work geometrically , e. getzler @xcite found a g - algebra structure in the physical state space of an abstract tcft ( as well as in a topological `` massive '' quantum field theory ) . </S>",
    "<S> getzler s ongoing work with j. jones was already dealing with g - algebras as the @xmath2 case of @xmath3-algebras . </S>",
    "<S> segal s ideas , see @xcite , played an essential role in getzler s discovery . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , segal had already developed an extension to tcfts of his geometric category approach @xcite to conformal field theory .    </S>",
    "<S> later on y .- z . </S>",
    "<S> huang @xcite found a third approach which combined the ideas of lian , zuckerman and getzler . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , huang took steps towards the construction of a tcft from a tvoa ; this work was based on huang s earlier demonstration of how to construct a ( tree - level ) holomorphic conformal field theory ( cft ) from a vertex operator algebra ( voa ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a connection between segal s geometric approach to conformal field theory and borcherds algebraic definition @xcite of a voa ( see also the book of i. frenkel , j. lepowsky and a. meurman @xcite ) had already been suggested in some public lectures by i. frenkel @xcite .    from the very beginning of the above development </S>",
    "<S> , it was understood that the physical state space of a tcft is merely the cohomology of a much more enormous object , the brst complex of the tcft . </S>",
    "<S> thus there arose the question : does the g - algebra structure on the vector space of physical states come from a higher homotopy g - algebra structure on the brst complex itself ? </S>",
    "<S> this question was explicitly raised by lian and zuckerman in their work on tvoas and associated tcfts . </S>",
    "<S> they found that in the brst complex of a tvoa , all of the identities of a g - algebra fail to hold on the nose , but they continue to hold up to homotopy . </S>",
    "<S> they then asked whether these homotopies could be continued to an infinite hierarchy of higher homotopies , such as those found in the work of stasheff on @xmath4-algebras and the more recent work of stasheff and t. lada on @xmath5-algebras .    </S>",
    "<S> the inspiration for the search for higher homotopy algebras in topological conformal field theory arose in the related context of closed string field theory , see stasheff @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit discussion of higher homotopy algebras in string field theory appeared in work of stasheff @xcite , m. kontsevich @xcite , and e. witten and b. zwiebach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the later joint papers of t. kimura , a. voronov and stasheff @xcite constructed @xmath5 and @xmath6 structures using the operadic approach . these papers also include a conceptual explanation of the relationship between string field theory and tcfts .    </S>",
    "<S> however , research on higher homotopies suffered from a lack of a proper definition of a higher homotopy gerstenhaber algebra ( homotopy g - algebra ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , various definitions have been put forward , in particular in work of v. ginzburg and m. kapranov @xcite , getzler and jones @xcite , and gerstenhaber and voronov @xcite . in the current paper </S>",
    "<S> , we use the term @xmath7-algebra to refer to a particular definition of a homotopy g - algebra appearing in the work of getzler and jones ( definition  [ hg ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this definition is based on pioneering work of r. fox and l. neuwirth . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7-algebras are governed by what we call the @xmath7-operad .    </S>",
    "<S> the main new result of the current paper is the proof that the brst complex of a tcft is indeed a @xmath7-algebra . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a ( tree - level ) tcft itself is defined to be an algebra over a particular topological operad . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this paper , both the `` classical '' theory of topological operads as well as the recent theory of linear operads play essential roles .    </S>",
    "<S> the original question of lian and zuckerman can now be formulated precisely ( see our conjecture  [ conj ] ) : does a tvoa carry a natural @xmath7 structure ? </S>",
    "<S> since we have answered the analogous question for a tcft , a crucial step still remains in the program to answer the original question : the completion of huang s work on the construction of a tcft from a tvoa . </S>",
    "<S> such a construction should identify the brst complex of the tcft with an appropriate topological completion of the brst complex of the tvoa . </S>",
    "<S> we look forward to the successful conclusion of this program .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the essential tools of our paper is m. wolf and zwiebach s `` string vertices '' , which make a bridge between a topological operad of punctured riemann spheres and the infinite dimensional topological operad responsible for cfts . </S>",
    "<S> amazingly , the latter operad plays a key role in the subjects of vassiliev invariants and double loop spaces . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , string vertices combined with the approach of our paper yield vassiliev invariants of knots in section  [ vass ] and the structure of a homotopy g - algebra on the singular chain complex of a double loop space in section  [ double ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we are very grateful to t.  q.  t.  le , b.  lian , a.  s. schwarz , and j.  stasheff for helpful discussions . </S>",
    "<S> t.k . and a.a.v . </S>",

    "<S> loday and j. stasheff for their hospitality at the wonderful conference in luminy . </S>",
    "<S> t.k . and g.j.z . </S>",
    "<S> would like to thank a.a.v . for inviting them to the terrific conference at hartford . </S>",
    "<S> a.a.v . </S>",
