    "in cosmology we attempt to draw large conclusions from limited and often ambiguous data .",
    "i am impressed at how well the enterprise is succeeding , to the point that we have an established standard model for the hot expanding universe ( peebles _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) . which elements to include in the standard model is a matter for ongoing debate , of course .",
    "i am inclined to take a conservative line if only to avoid giving misleading impressions to our colleagues with deconstructionist tendencies .",
    "for example , the adiabatic cold dark matter model for structure formation has been more successful than i expected , and as a result is rightly the model most commonly used in studies of how structure might have formed .",
    "simon white calls this model a paradigm , which i take to mean a pattern many find useful and convenient in their research .",
    "i like this use of the term , provided we agree to distinguish it from a well - established standard model .",
    "i think we can not count the adiabatic cold mark matter paradigm as part of the standard model for cosmology because , as argued here , there is a viable and perhaps even more attractive alternative .",
    "i organize this discussion around the issues of the weight of the evidence on whether galaxies are good tracers of mass , what we are learning from the cosmological tests , and the elements of the standard model for structure formation on the scale of galaxies and larger .",
    "i begin with another question , whether einstein s introduction of the cosmological principle set a good example for research in our field .",
    "the hurried reader will find the main points summarized in   6 .",
    "the tension between caution and adventure in the advance of science is well illustrated by the histories these two principles .",
    "einstein ( 1917 ) introduced modern cosmology with his application of general relativity theory to a universe that is spatially homogeneous on average ( that is , a stationary random process ) .",
    "milne gave the homogeneity assumption its name , einstein s cosmological principle .",
    "it is difficult to find in the published literature evidence that einstein was aware of the observational situation on the distribution of matter .",
    "astronomers had established that we live in a bounded island universe of stars , and some had speculated that the spiral nebulae are other island universes .",
    "de  sitter ( 1917 ) was willing to consider the possibility that the nebulae are uniformly distributed in the large - scale mean , and that their mass constitutes einstein s near - homogeneous world matter .",
    "on the other hand , de  sitter was well aware that the distribution of the nearby nebulae is decidedly clumpy ; indeed , charlier ( 1922 ) pointed out that it resembles a clustering hierarchy ( what we would now call a fractal ) .",
    "that is , the conservative advice from the astronomical community would have been that the observations do not support einstein s world picture , that he would do well to consider a fractal model instead . but now einstein s cosmological principle is well established and part of the standard model : fluctuations from homogeneity on the scale of the hubble length are less than one part in @xmath0 ( from the isotropy of the x - ray background , and about one part in @xmath1 in the standard relativistic model ; peebles 1993 ) .",
    "this is a magnificent triumph of pure thought !",
    "just as the cosmological principle was introduced by hand to solve a theoretical problem , the violation of mach s principle in asymptotically flat spacetime , the biasing principle was introduced to reconcile the low relative peculiar velocities of the galaxies with the high mass density of the theoretically preferred einstein - de  sitter world model ( davis _ et al .",
    "there never has been any serious observational evidence for biasing , but the idea rightly was taken seriously because it is elegant and plausible .",
    "but i do not include biasing in the standard model ; we have no very strong evidence for it and the following three arguments against it .",
    "first , there is no identification of a population of void irregular galaxies , remnants of the assumed suppression of galaxy formation in the voids ( peebles 1989 ) .",
    "the first systematic redshift survey showed that the distributions of low and high luminosity galaxies are strikingly similar ( davis _ et al .",
    "i know of no survey since , in 21-cm , infrared , ultraviolet , or low surface brightness optical , that reveals a void population .",
    "there is a straightforward interpretation : the voids are nearly empty because they contain little mass .",
    "second , the improving suite of cosmological tests listed in the next section suggests the mean mass density is well below the einstein - de  sitter value .",
    "if the density is low it means galaxies move slowly because there is not much mass to gravitationally pull them , not because they are biased tracers of the mass .    third , the galaxy autocorrelation function at low redshift has a simple form , quite close to the power law @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , over three orders of magnitude in separation , @xmath4 .",
    "carlberg shows in these proceedings that the index @xmath5 is quite close to constant back to redshifts near unity . on the theoretical side",
    ", simon white describes elegant numerical simulations of the adiabatic cdm model . in these simulations",
    "the mass autocorrelation function @xmath6 is not close to a power law , and the slope of @xmath6 increases with increasing time .",
    "the two functions allow us to define a bias parameter , b(r , t ) = ^1/2 .",
    "[ eq : bias ] in the adiabatic cdm model this is a function of separation and time .",
    "one interpretation is galaxies are biased tracers of mass , the bias depending on scale and time . but why should the biased tracer exhibit a striking regularity , in @xmath7 and the three - and four - point functions , that is not a property of the mass that is driving evolution ?",
    "the more straightforward reading is that the regularity in @xmath7 reflects a like regularity in the behaviour of the mass , and that there is a slight flaw in the model . given the enormous step we are taking in analyzing the growth of the structure of the universe it surely would not be surprising to learn that we have not yet got it exactly right .",
    "in the standard friedmann - lematre cosmological model coordinates can be assigned so the mean line element is ds^2 = dt^2 - a(t)^2 .",
    "the mean expansion rate satisfies the equation h^2 = ( aa ) ^2 = 83 g + 3 , which can be approximated as h^2= h_o^2[(1+z)^3 + ( 1+z)^2 + ] .",
    "[ eq : cos_pars ] this defines the fractional contributions to the square of the expansion rate by matter , space curvature , and the cosmological constant ( or a term in the stress - energy tensor that acts like one ) .",
    "the time - dependence assumes pressureless matter and constant @xmath8 .",
    "other notations are in the literature ; one that is becoming popular adds the matter and @xmath8 terms , as in michael turner s contribution to these proceedings . to avoid confusion with the definitions in equation  ( [ eq : cos_pars ] ) we might express turner s convention as  = + .",
    "this isolates the curvature term , which is useful . and",
    "since the evidence is that @xmath9 is small it certainly helps rescue our theoretical preference for a density parameter equal to unity .",
    "i find it unsatisfying , however : what became of the intense debates we had on biasing and the other systematic errors in the measurement of @xmath9 ?",
    "i can get more excited about the full monty : let ^ = + + = 1 - .",
    "[ eq : fm ] each of the terms on the right - hand side of this equation is measurable in principle , and if the applications of the cosmological tests continue to improve at the present rate it may not be many more years before we have ten percent measurements of the three numbers .",
    "if they add to unity we will have a test of general relativity theory applied on large scales in the strong curvature limit .",
    "_ here s my problem : the conference wants latex , the table is set in plain tex because it s much too fiddly for latex , and lanl wo nt accept a postscript file of the compiled file of the table . what is a computer - challenged person to do ? _    the point is illustrated another way in table  1 .",
    "the lines represent quite different ways to probe the standard relativistic model , and the columns are grades for how well three sets of parameter choices fit the results .",
    "as the observations improve we may find that only one narrow range of parameters is consistent with all the constraints .",
    "if so we will have settled two issues .",
    "first , it surely will continue to be difficult to use internal evidence to rule out systematic errors in astronomical observations .",
    "for example , can astronomers unambiguously demonstrate that sneia in a given class of light curve shape really are drawn from the identical population at redshifts @xmath10 and @xmath11 ?",
    "a consistent story from independent tests is strong evidence the measurements have not been corrupted by some subtle systematic error .",
    "second , a consistent story will be a strong positive test of the standard relativistic cosmological model , as in equation  ( [ eq : fm ] ) .",
    "the successful parameter set could be quite different from any of the choices in the table , of course ; we may be driven to a dynamical @xmath8 , for example ( peebles &  ratra 1988 ; huey _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "the classical cosmological tests based on measures of the spacetime geometry have been supplemented by a new class of tests based on the condition that the cosmology admit a consistent and observationally acceptable model for structure formation ( categories 3 and 4 in table  1 ) .",
    "i comment on some aspects of structure formation in  4 and  5 .",
    "the constraint from the rate of lensing of quasars by foreground galaxies does not comfortably fit the curvature of the redshift - angular distance relation .",
    "the analysis of lensing by falco _",
    "( 1998 ) , for a combined sample of lensing events detected in the optical and radio , indicates that if the universe is cosmologically flat then @xmath12 at one standard deviation , and @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",
    "the sneia redshift magnitude relation , from the magnificent work of perlmutter _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) and reiss _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) , seems best fit by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the discrepancy is not far outside the error flags , but i think that if the lensing rate were the only available cosmological test we would greet it as confirmation of the einstein - de  sitter model and another success for pure thought .",
    "the lensing constraint depends on the galaxy mass function .",
    "the predicted peak of the lensing rate at angular separation @xmath17 arc  sec is dominated by the high surface density branch of early - type galaxies at luminosities @xmath18 .",
    "the number density of these objects is not well known , and an improved measurement is an important goal for the new generations of surveys of galaxies . if further tests of the lensing and redshift - magnitude constraints confirm an inconsistency for constant @xmath8 the lesson may be that the cosmological constant is dynamical , rolling to zero , as ratra &  quillen ( 1992 ) point out .",
    "the einstein - de  sitter model is not yet ruled out , but i think most of us would agree that consideration of structure formation in low density cosmological models is well motivated .",
    "we have good reason to think galaxies grew by gravity out of small initial departures from homogeneity , but the nature of the initial conditions is open to discussion . to illustrate this i present some elements of an isocurvature model .",
    "details are in peebles ( 1998@xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .      in",
    "the paradigm simon white describes in these proceedings structure grows out of an adiabatic departure from homogeneity  as would be produced by local reversible expansion or contraction from exact homogeneity  that is a spatially stationary isotropic random gaussian process .",
    "another possibility is that the primeval mass distribution is exactly homogeneous  there is no perturbation to spacetime curvature  and structure formation is seeded by an inhomogeneous composition . in the isocurvature model presented here",
    "the initial entropy per baryon is homogeneous , to preserve the paradigm for element formation , and homogeneity is broken by the distribution of cold dark matter . in both models the present mass of the universe is dominated by nonbaryonic cold dark matter ( cdm ) ; i shall call them acdm and icdm models .      in the acdm model",
    "the primeval mass density fluctuation ( defined as the most rapidly growing density perturbation mode in time - orthogonal coordinates ) has a close to power law power spectrum , @xmath21 . in the icdm model",
    "the primeval distribution of the cdm is close to a power law , @xmath22 , in a homogeneous net mass distribution .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to check that in linear perturbation theory the evolution from the initial radiation - dominated universe to the present cdm - dominated epoch bends the spectra to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the wavenumber appearing at the hubble length at the redshift @xmath25 of equality of mass densities in matter and radiation .",
    "the similarity of equations  ( [ eq : aspect ] ) and  ( [ eq : ispect ] ) for @xmath26 extends to roughly similar spectra of the angular distribution of the thermal cosmic background radiation ( the cbr ) in the adiabatic and isocurvature cdm models .",
    "the status of acdm model fits to the fluctuation spectra of galaxies and the cbr is discussed in these proceedings by bond .",
    "figures  1 and  2 show the icdm model predictions for the parameters m = -1.8,= 0.2 , = 0.8 , h = 0.7 , [ eq : parameters ] with the normalization p(k ) = 6300h^-3 ^ 3 k = 0.1h^-1 , [ eq : pnorm ] where hubble s constant is @xmath27  km  s@xmath28  mpc@xmath28 .",
    "the data in figure  1 are from the iras psc - z ( point source catalog ) redshift survey of saunders _ et al . _",
    "this is the real space spectrum after correction for peculiar velocity distortion represented by the density - bias parameter @xmath29 .",
    "there are good measurements of the spectrum of the galaxy distribution on smaller scales , @xmath30  mpc@xmath28 , but this approaches the nonlinear sector , and it seems appropriate to postpone discussion of the small - scale mass distribution until we have analyses of nonlinear evolution from the non - gaussian initial conditions of the model in equation  ( [ eq : icdmrho ] ) . since the psc - z catalog is deep , with good sky coverage , it promises to be an excellent probe of the large - scale galaxy distribution , and it is a very useful normalization .",
    "figure  2 shows second moments of the angular distribution of the cbr , where t ( , ) = a_l^m y_l^m ( , ) , t_l = ^1/2 |a_l^m|^2 ^ 1/2 .",

    "the second moments of the large - scale distributions of mass and radiation in the icdm model agree with the data as well about as could be expected given the state of these difficult measurements .",
    "the same is true of acdm models considered by bond ; both cases pass . at",
    "most one will pass the improved measurements expected from work in progress , but that is for the future .",
    "simple and arguably natural realizations of the inflation concept lead to adiabatic initial conditions ; others to isocurvature initial conditions . in the example of the latter in peebles ( 1998@xmath19 ) the cdm is a scalar field @xmath36 that ends up after inflation in a squeezed state as a gaussian random process with mass density ( * x * ) = m^2(*x*)^2/2 , [ eq : icdmrho ] for field mass @xmath37 . in a simple case",

    "the primeval density fluctuations in the model in equations  ( [ eq : icdmrho ] ) and  ( [ eq : icdme ] ) are non - gaussian and scale - invariant : the frequency distribution of the density contrast @xmath42 averaged through a window and scaled by the standard deviation @xmath43 is independent of the window size .",
    "the evidence discussed in peebles ( 1998@xmath20 ) indicates the model with these initial conditions is viable but subject to serious tests from improvements from observational work in progress .",
    "the same is true of the acdm models , of course .",

    "the power law model for the primeval cdm fluctuation spectrum ( eqs .",

    "the rms contrast through a window of comoving radius @xmath45 varies as x^-(3+m)/2d(t ) .",
    "gravitational structure formation is triggered by passage of upward fluctuations of @xmath42 through unity , and the threshold is not sensitive to @xmath9 in a cosmologically flat model .",
    "this means the characteristic physical length , mass , and internal velocity of newly forming structures scale with time as r_nl(1+z)^-1d^2/(3+m ) , md^6/(3+m ) , ( 1+z)^1/2d^2/(3+m ) .",
    "these relations neglect nongravitational interactions ; they may be expected to be useful approximations on scales much larger than the half - light radii in galaxies , where the cdm halo dominates the mass in the standard model .",

    "if dense galaxies can be assembled at low redshift , when the mean mass density is low , one might have thought that protogalaxies assembled at high redshift and high mean mass density would be unacceptably dense .",
    "but nature was able to form clusters of galaxies that are close to virial equilibrium at modest density contrast at the abell radius , and well enough isolated that they seem likely to remain part of the clustering hierarchy rather than merging into larger monolithic superclusters . under the scaling argument",
    "the same would be true of protogalaxies assembled at @xmath57 in the icdm model .",
    "i arrived at the isocurvature model in  4 ( and peebles 1998@xmath19 and  @xmath20 ) through a search for a model for galaxy formation at high redshift , when the cosmic mean density is comparable to that of the luminous parts of a normal large galaxy .",

    "the dashed line in the figure assumes spherical symmetry with no orbit crossing , expansion from cosmological initial conditions , and collapse to half the maximum radius , at which point the kinetic energy in the spherical model has reached half the magnitude of the gravitational potential energy .",
    "the solid line for the motion of m31 relative to the milky way has a similar shape but with significant differences . in the numerical solution neighbouring galaxies are close to the milky way and m31 at @xmath63",

    "the solid line is less strongly curved at larger expansion factor because the interaction with neighbouring mass concentrations has given the milky way and m31 substantial relative angular momentum .",

    "these are arguments , not demonstrations .",
    "i consider them persuasive enough to lend support to the isocurvature model that leads from the fit to measures of large - scale structure in figures  1 and  2 to the scaling model for early galaxy assembly in equation  ( [ eq : young_galaxies ] ) .",
    "this depends on whether galaxies really were assembled early , of course , and are fortunate that the observations steidel describes in there proceedings may well be capable of telling us when the galaxies formed .",
    "it is inevitable that the exciting rush of advances in this subject has left ideas unexplored .",
    "i have attempted to identify some roads not taken , less popular lines of thought that seem worth considering .",
    "the main points are summarized in the following questions .",
    "einstein s brilliant success in establishing key elements of the standard cosmological model is an example of why we pay serious attention to elegant ideas even in the face of contrary empirical indications .",
    "but i think this is not an entirely edifying example : einstein s intuition was not always so successful , and most of us are not einsteins . in the present still crude state of cosmology",
    "it is better to be led by the phenomenology from astronomy and from particle physics ( that may teach us the identity of the dark matter , for example ) .",
    "most of us agree that the einstein - de  sitter model is the elegant case , and it makes sense that the community has given it special attention despite the long - standing indication from galaxy peculiar velocities that the einstein - de  sitter density is too high .",
    "now other lines of evidence are pointing in the same direction , as summarized in table  1 , and i think there is general agreement in the community that we must give serious consideration to the possibility that nature has other ideas about elegance .",
    "i count this as a cautionary example for the exploration of ideas on how the galaxies formed .",
    "the galaxy two - point correlation function is quite close to a power law , @xmath81 , over three orders of magnitude of separation @xmath82 at low redshift , and the index @xmath5 is quite close to constant back to redshifts approaching unity .",

    "thus we have a measure of bias , @xmath83 ^{1/2}$ ] ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : bias ] ] ) , that depends on position and time .",
    "should we take this as evidence galaxies are biased mass tracers ? since the regularity is in the galaxies surely the first possibility to consider is that @xmath7 is revealing a like regularity in the behaviour of the mass , that the bias is in the model .",
    "this reading is heavily influenced by a related issue : if much of the cdm is in the voids defined by normal galaxies where are the remnants of the void galaxies ?",
    "surely they are not entirely invisible ?",
    "i am impressed by the elegant simulations of the acdm models simon white presents in these proceedings , and have to believe they reflect aspects of reality .",
    "but the curious issue of @xmath84 leads me to suspect there is more to the story .",
    "would the isocurvature variant do better ?",
    "that awaits searching tests by numerical simulations of the kind that that have been applied to the adiabatic case .",
    "one often reads that it is to determine how the world ends .",
    "but should we trust an extrapolation into the indefinitely remote future of a theory that we know can only be a good approximation to reality ? for a trivial example , suppose the universe has zero space curvature and the present value of the density parameter in matter capable of clustering is @xmath15 , with the rest of the contribution to @xmath85 in a term that acts like a cosmological `` constant '' @xmath8 that is rolling toward zero ( peebles & ratra 1988 ; huey _ et al .",

    "i would consider a bare answer an empty advance , because the excitement of physical science is in discovering the interconnections among phenomena .",
    "perhaps the excitement of knowing how the world ends will be in what it teaches us about how the world began .",

    "the structure formation theory in turn tests ideas about what the universe was like before it was well described by the classical friedmann - lematre model , and may eventually allow us to enlarge the standard model to include the story of how the world begins and ends .",
    "generally accepted elements are the gravitational growth of small primeval departures from homogeneity , that may be described as a stationary isotropic random process , in a universe with present mass that is dominated by cdm and maybe a term that acts like a cosmological constant .",
    "the most striking piece of evidence for the gravitational instability picture is the agreement between the primeval density fluctuations needed to produce the cbr anisotropy and the present distribution and motion of the galaxies .",
    "precision measurements in progress should allow us to fix many of the details of this gravitational instability picture , but within present constraints we can not say that the primeval density fluctuations are gaussian , or adiabatic , because we have a viable alternative , the non - gaussian isocurvature model mentioned in   4 .",
    "the main piece of evidence for the cdm is the mismatch between the baryon mass density in the standard model for the origin of the light elements and the mass density indicated by dynamical analyses of relative motions of the galaxies .",
    "our reliance on hypothetical mass is embarrassing ; a laboratory demonstration of its existence would be an exceedingly valuable advance .",
    "it is a sign of the growing maturity of our field that we can pose questions that are motivated by specific theoretical issues and can be addressed by feasible observations .",
    "but i think our subject still is immature enough that we should be quite prepared for surprises .",
    "my favorite example is shaver s ( 1991 ) demonstration that the radio galaxies within @xmath86  mpc distance are close to the plane of the local supercluster , even though the plane is not apparent in the general distribution of galaxies at this depth .",
    "if the clusters and radio sources were produced by a pancake collapse why do we not see it in the general galaxy distribution ?",
    "maybe a better picture is that in the early universe a nearly straight cosmic string passed by , piling mass in its wake into a sheet that fragmented into the seeds of engines of active galaxies .",
    "i think the most surprising outcome of the new surveys would be that there are no major corrections to what we think we know .",
    "this work was supported in part by the usa national science foundation ."

    "<S> i argue that the weight of the available evidence favours the conclusions that galaxies are unbiased tracers of mass , the mean mass density ( excluding a cosmological constant or its equivalent ) is less than the critical einstein - de  sitter value , and an isocurvature model for structure formation offers a viable and arguably attractive model for the early assembly of galaxies . if valid these conclusions complicate our work of adding structure formation to the standard model for cosmology , but it seems sensible to pay attention to evidence .    </S>",
