    "there is overwhelming evidence that the universe is filled with nonbaryonic dark matter ( dm ) . however , despite the wealth of cosmological evidence for its existence , its particle physics properties remain a complete mystery . among the many candidates proposed , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are among the best motivated , due to the possibility of understanding their abundance as thermal relics and potential connection to electroweak symmetry - breaking .",
    "the hunt is on to discover dark matter through direct observation of its scattering with nuclei , indirectly through its annihilation into high energy particles , and through its production at colliders .",
    "this is a particularly exciting time for direct detection experiments .",
    "detectors are achieving unprecedented sensitivity , and will improve their discovery reach by orders of magnitude .",
    "a positive signal at such an experiment would be our first hint that dark matter has interactions beyond gravitational , and would confirm the wimp picture of dark matter and open the door to improving our quantitative understanding of the early universe through its relic density .",
    "in fact , the experimental situation is somewhat confusing .",
    "dama / libra @xcite and cogent @xcite both report signals which have defied explanation in terms of conventional backgrounds to wimp searches , but xenon @xcite , and cdms @xcite seem to exclude some or all of the parameter space necessary to explain them .",
    "one of the key properties which distinguish different visions for the nature of dark matter are its spin and the nature of its interactions with standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "the most common assumption is that heavy particles ( including perhaps the sm @xmath0 and higgs bosons ) mediate the interactions , resulting in interactions which are essentially contact interactions at the length scales probed by the direct searches .",
    "however , it remains possible that dark matter interacts with ordinary matter by exchanging photons . to remain dark",
    ", it must be electrically neutral , so the coupling to photons must be described by a higher multipole interaction . in particular , a dirac fermion wimp could couple to photons through an electric or magnetic dipole moment , and this could provide the dominant mechanism for scattering off heavy nuclei either elastically @xcite or inelastically @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that dipole - moment interacting dark matter ( dmdm ) with mass around @xmath1 gev and magnetic gyromagnetic ratio around @xmath2 ( i.e. with magnetic dipole moment around @xmath3 @xmath4-cm ) is ( marginally ) consistent with results from direct detection experiments including cdms - ii @xcite , xenon100 @xcite , dama @xcite , and cogent @xcite . as part of this work ,",
    "we update these bounds to include the recent cdms low threshold analysis @xcite and find that it excludes the cogent and dama regions for elastic scattering at the @xmath5 cl .",
    "nonetheless , the electromagentic dipole moment is an interesting portal for a wimp to interact with the standard model , and it is an important part of the over - all picture of dark matter interactions to understand the bounds from existing experiments as well as future prospects for discovery .",
    "a final important question is whether or not dmdm can realize the wimp(less ) miracle @xcite .",
    "early proposals for dmdm had large dipole moments by virtue of the wimp itself being composite @xcite . the dark matter relic abundance was generated non - thermally through strong dynamics , and ultimately determined by a primordial asymmetry between wimps and anti - wimps .",
    "this is an attractive picture , but the magnetic land factor consistent with the direct detection experiments is small enough to suggest that the dark sector is weakly coupled .",
    "this opens the possibility that the dark matter may be a more standard thermal relic , and it would be interesting to see how the parameter space consistent with a thermal relic is related to that relevant for direct detection experiments .    in this article",
    ", we build upon refs @xcite to explore dmdm from the points of view of the thermal relic density and in light of constraints from both lep and hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "it is organized as follows : section  [ sec : dmdm ] briefly reviews the theory of dmdm . section  [ sec : abundance ] computes the thermal relic density of dmdm and identifies the parameter space consistent with a thermal relic .",
    "section [ sec : collider ] discusses collider bounds on dmdm from lep and the tevatron as well as the reach of the lhc .",
    "finally section [ sec : conc ] summarizes the dmdm bounds from direct detection experiments @xcite , the dmdm thermal relic density constraint for weakly - coupled dark sectors and the dmdm bounds from colliders .",
    "we work in an effective theory framework , assuming that the only relevant degree of freedom of the dark sector at the energies of interest is the wimp itself .",
    "the wimp is a dirac fermion dm @xmath6 of mass @xmath7 which interacts with the sm through electromagnetic dipole moments @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the dm magnetic and electric gyromagnetic ratios , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electromagnetic ( dual ) field strengths . along with the higgs portal operator @xmath13 ( considered elsewhere @xcite ) , the magnetic and electric dipole operators are the gauge - invariant dimension @xmath14 operators coupling the dm to the sm and are thus among the most relevant operators mediating sm - dm interaction .",
    "the electric dipole moment operator violates the discrete symmetries p and t. in models where these symmetries are spontaneously broken , the electric dipole operator is effectively of dimension @xmath15 operator where @xmath16 .",
    "the magnetic and electric land factors are related to the dm scale @xmath17 and cp - violating scale @xmath18 through @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .    in terms of the parameters of @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", the dmdm has a magnetic dipole moment @xmath21 and an electric dipole moment @xmath22 .",
    "naive dimensional analysis suggests that fermionic dm land factors @xmath9 and @xmath23 are order one in theories with a strongly - coupled dark sector , and loop - suppressed when the dark sector is weakly - coupled .",
    "in this section we examine the thermal relic density of dmdm in theories with a weakly - coupled dark sectors .",
    "we perform the thermal relic density computation under the assumption that there is no primordial asymmetry between @xmath6 and @xmath24 . at freeze - out , the wimp is non - relativistic for the masses of interest , and its relic density is determined from its annihilation cross section into standard model particles as usual @xcite .",
    "the annihilation cross sections for dmdm to sm particles at lowest order in the relative velocity @xmath25 and neglecting the fermion masses are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fermion charge . in the limit of zero sm fermion mass ,",
    "magnetic - dipole interacting dark matter has predominantly @xmath28-wave annihilation into sm fermions , while the leading electric - dipole interaction is @xmath29-wave .",
    "annihilation into photons is @xmath28-wave for both .",
    "we neglect annihilation into a pair of @xmath30 bosons and/or top quarks , which will correct these expressions for @xmath31  gev , but as we will see , the possibility of a thermal relic for this range of masses is already excluded by direct detection experiments .    the thermally averaged annihilation cross section @xmath32 can be written , @xmath33\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are extracted in terms of @xmath9 or @xmath10 and @xmath7 from eq .",

    "the values of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for which the correct thermal relic density is obtained for a give wimp mass are plotted in figures  [ fig:90pclm ] and  [ fig:90pcle ] , respectively .",
    "dmdm can also be produced at colliders , which may provide complimentary information to the direct detection experiments @xcite .",
    "the analysis is somewhat similar to studies which probe contact interactions between wimps and quarks and gluons @xcite or leptons @xcite , but with the added feature that the mediator particle is now the massless photon .",
    "we examine the implications of collider searches for photon plus missing energy and jet plus missing energy final states on dmdm .",
    "any theory with non - renormalizable interactions must be understood as an effective theory , breaking down at some finite energy scale .",
    "firm predictions can only be made at energies well below this scale . in the case of dmdm ,",
    "theories with a weakly coupled dark sector such that @xmath46 have robust predictions for wimp production at the lhc . for a strongly coupled dark sector such as a composite wimp",
    ", the momentum transfer will be of order the compositeness scale , which could invalidate bounds ( and also could potentially lead to a variety of other interesting signals ) .      in lepton colliders , production of @xmath47",
    "( missing transverse energy in the detector ) plus a photon can lead to an observable signal , @xmath48 the photon can be produced either as initial state radiation from the incoming leptons , or directly from the dmdm final state through is dipole moment .",
    "initial state radiation enjoys a large collinear singularity which causes the cross section to grow as @xmath49 when the photon is approximately collinear with the incoming @xmath50 beams .",
    "thus , it completely dominates the final state radiation ( which we neglect ) .",

    "a search for this signal was performed using the l3 detector based on several different lep ii collider energies @xcite .",
    "the most significant sm background is production of a @xmath0-boson ( decaying to neutrinos , and this producing missing transverse energy in the final state ) together with initial state radiation .",

    "direct detection constraints are already quite strong @xcite , somewhat stronger on the electric dipole moment than on the magnetic dipole moment .",

    "this translates into @xmath102gev and @xmath103 .",
    "since lep requires @xmath104gev for @xmath101 gev , the former is tightly constrained by lep while the latter is excluded by lep . ] . at larger masses , a non - thermal production mechanism",
    "such as could occur in theories with a strongly - coupled dark sector @xcite must be invoked .",
    "collider bounds are typically somewhat weaker than the direct detection bounds , which are also stronger than typical indirect detection bounds from annihilation into @xmath105 @xcite . although , due to a cleaner environment , the lep bounds are stronger by an order of magnitude compared to the tevatron bounds , both bounds are barely consistent with a weakly - coupled theory .",
    "the lhc discovery prospects in the jets + missing energy channel are not very promising , being already excluded by lep ii at low masses , and direct detection experiments at large masses .",
    "of course , with its large center - of - mass energy , one could hope that the lhc could also directly produce even heavier states in the dark sector .",
    "their signatures are model - dependent , but there is much potential for discovery of states with higher production rates and/or more striking experimental signals with lower backgrounds .    dark matter coupled through the photon portal is an interesting and motivated vision which leads to a somewhat different perspective from the standard wimp .",
    "understanding its allowed parameter space is an important step in its search .",
