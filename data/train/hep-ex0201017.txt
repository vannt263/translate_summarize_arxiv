    "in deep underground experiments , the ratio @xmath0/@xmath1 of double muon events over single muon events is expected to decrease as a function of the rock depth , unless some exotic phenomena occur .",
    "the ratio @xmath0/@xmath1 has been studied in several underground experiments and phenomenological papers ( elbert , 1981 ) .    in general , it is hard to conclude that these measurements are in contrast with standard physics expectations , because the cuts required to cancel the contribution of muon pair production and of fake tracks due to hadro - production are not applied to data .",
    "moreover , a comparison with monte carlo expectations is not reported in these papers .",
    "much stronger conclusions arise from a recent measurement of the lvd collaboration at gran sasso .",
    "they have presented results on the ratio of multiple - muon flux to all - muon flux as a function of the rock depth ( ryazhskaya , 2000 ) .",
    "they find that this ratio decreases for rock depth @xmath2 but increases for @xmath3 .",
    "the increase at large depth is in disagreement with the calculations performed with the corsika ( capdevielle , 1992 ) and music ( antonioli , 1997 ) monte carlos ( based on `` standard physics '' ) . in order to rule out the muon pair production as a possible mechanism generating the excess of multiple muon events",
    ", they required a minimum distance of 1 meter between the muons in the bundle .",
    "their result can not be explained unless some other exotic phenomenon occurs with relatively high probability .",
    "here we report the results of a similar measurement performed with the macro detector at gran sasso .",
    "our goal is to understand the prediction of standard physics in macro and to compare it with experimental data .",
    "this paper has a remarkable interest for macro , because it is the first analysis including multiple muon events at large zenith angle .",
    "we measured the ratio @xmath0/@xmath1 of double muon events over single muon events as a function of the rock depth .",
    "we did not include events with multiplicity @xmath4 in the analysis for simplicity , since they represent a small fraction of the whole multiple muon sample : in the lvd eperiment located near ours , only about 30 % of multiple muon events for @xmath5 have multiplicity @xmath4 .",
    "rock depth is provided by the gran sasso map function @xmath6 . for each event",
    ", we had to determine the muon multiplicity @xmath7 ( @xmath7=1,@xmath7=2,@xmath82 ) and the direction @xmath9 .",
    "the macro track reconstruction algorithm provides the number of tracks @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in three independent views , respectively : horizontal wires ( hw ) , horizontal strips ( hs ) and vertical wires ( vw ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     events belonging to sample 3 have been analysed in a different way .",
    "these are events with no tracks reconstructed in horizontal wires and horizontal strips views .",
    "this means that there are less than 4 aligned hits in these views .",
    "it is possible to recover events with at least three aligned hits in the hw view , making a safe track fit .",
    "a large fraction of the events have only two hits in the horizontal wire view , and can not be analysed since these hits can not be separated from the background hits .",
    "as far as the event multiplicity determination is concerned , we found that the best measurement @xmath13 of the `` true '' multiplicity @xmath14 is the biggest value among @xmath10 and @xmath12 . via monte carlo",
    ", we estimated that the percentage of events with mis - reconstructed multiplicity is less that 3% , both for single and for double muon events .    , width=351 ]    in table  [ tb : allsamples ] we show the result of a monte carlo study of the quality of event direction @xmath9 and rock depth @xmath6 measurement for the whole data sample ( samples 1,2 and 3 together ) .",
    "the results are reported separately for single and double muon events .",
    "we emphasise that the relative error in rock reconstruction is always smaller than 10% .    in fig.[fig :",
    "n2n1_mc ] we show the ratio of doubles to singles as a function of the rock depth obtained with monte carlo simulation .",
    "we compare the underground muons falling over an infinite area ( i.e. neglecting all detector effects ) , those falling into a box with volume equal to detector fiducial volume ( i.e. considering only geometrical detector effects ) and those reconstructed by the complete detector simulation ( i.e. with all detector effects and all cuts applied ) . within statistical uncertainties ,",
    "we find a monotonic decrease of all curves , as expected in a `` standard physics '' frame .",
    "we find also that there are no detector effects strongly dependent on rock depth .    in fig.[fig",
    ": n2n1_sd ] we show the number of detected singles ( @xmath15 ) and doubles ( @xmath16 ) as a function of rock depth .",
    "their ratio @xmath17/@xmath18 is plotted in fig.[fig : n2n1_data ] .",
    "our results are in agreement with the expectation of a monotonic decrease of @xmath17/@xmath18 down to @xmath19 . above this value",
    ", the insufficient statistics does not allow to state a firm conclusion on a possible increase of @xmath17/@xmath18 .",
    "we remark that the monte carlo prediction is above experimental data for rock @xmath20 . however , the difference is small ( less than 18% ) and compatible with uncertainties on the primary cosmic ray flux and composition .",
    "moreover , we stress that the macro composition model has been obtained from macro data , using a different interaction model . the calculation with the dpmjet model",
    "provides about 8% more single muon events and about 30% more doubles , thus a larger ratio @xmath17/@xmath18 averaged over all rock depths .",
    "finally , in the same plot we superimpose the expectations obtained using pure @xmath21 and @xmath22 primaries : it is clear that the choice of the composition model can not explain any increase of @xmath17/@xmath18 ratio as a function of rock depth .",
    "we stress the importance of the cut number 4 quoted above : without this cut , the @xmath17/@xmath18 ratio exhibits a sharp increase around @xmath23 .",
    "this is due to noisy events which are often mis - reconstructed by the tracking algorithms as multiple muon events at large zenith angles .",
    "we have performed a visual scan of all double muons ( 47 events ) corresponding to the last 4 rock bins in the figure .",
    "three independent operators scanned the events and classified each event of the sample as : single , double , @xmath24 or anything else ( electronic noise , radioactive background or undetermined event ) .",
    "the result of this scan is that almost all the double muon events ( @xmath25 90 % ) have been correctly reconstructed .",
    "only the rock bin @xmath26 requires a relevant correction obtained by increasing the single muon events by 16.7% and reducing the doubles to 66.7% of the original sample .",
    "the correction factor that should be applied on @xmath17/@xmath18 is @xmath27 , but this does not change qualitatively our conclusions .",
    "the point at the highest rock depth corresponds to only one double muon event and is confirmed by the three operators .",
    "we presented the measurement of the ratio @xmath0/@xmath1 of double muon events over single muon events , as a function of the rock depth , performed with the macro detector at gran sasso .",
    "we verified with our hemas - dpm monte carlo that , if the processes of muon pair production by muons and of hadronic interactions in the rock surrounding the detector are rejected ( with the appropriate cuts on relative distance and angular spread between muons ) , and the fraction of hits in - track over the total number of hits is larger than @xmath28 ( to reduce background and improve double muon identification ) , then the ratio @xmath0/@xmath1 decreases as a function of the rock depth .",
    "our measurement is in agreement with the expectation of a monotonic decrease of @xmath17/@xmath18 down to @xmath19 . above this value ,",
    "the statistics are insufficient to allow a firm conclusion on a possible increase of @xmath17/@xmath18 .      ) to singles ( @xmath15 ) as a function of the reconstructed rock depth .",
    "solid circles = data ; open circles = monte carlo with macro composition model .",
    "monte carlo predictions using pure proton and iron primaries are also shown .",
