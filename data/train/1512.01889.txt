    "quantum state transfer ( qst ) in many - body solid state physical systems plays a central role in the realization of various localized quantum computation and quantum communication proposals @xcite .",
    "a practical high quality quantum state transfer scheme needs to possess several desirable features : i ) high fidelity ( to preserve the transferred message ) , ii ) robustness ( to tolerate inevitable practical errors , imperfections , and decoherence ) , iii ) efficiency ( to achieve optimal results with minimal implementations ) , and iv ) flexibility ( to serve for multiple tasks ) .",
    "the investigation of accomplishing high fidelity quantum state transfer in electronic and spin systems has recently drawn tremendous attention ( see for example @xcite and an overview @xcite ) .",
    "many of these schemes are based on the natural dynamical evolution of permanent coupled chain of quantum systems , and require no control during the qst .",
    "however , such schemes rely on precise manufacture of the system interaction parameters as well as accurate timing of information processing , and may not be robust against experimental imperfection settings , such as small variations of the system hamiltonian , environmental noise , etc .",
    "recently , adiabatic passage has been paid much attention for quantum information transfer in various physical systems @xcite .",
    "one typical way is called coherent qst which involves a quantum system that has an instantaneous eigenstate that is a superposition of a message state and its corresponding target state . stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite is such an example in a three - level atomic system . in this technique , the dark state which is a coherent superposition of message and target states plays a central role in the process of information transfer .",
    "in stirap evolution , the message and target states are coupled to a same intermediate state by a pump pulse and a stokes pulse respectively .",
    "if the two pulses are applied counter - intuitively , i.e. , the stokes pulse is applied before the pump , then the dark state is associated initially with the message state and eventually with the target state .",
    "such a process effectively transports the information of the message state to the desired target state .",
    "there are a couple of advantages of the adiabatic passage scheme : it is robust against small errors and imperfections of settings , and the qst timing can be controlled freely and precisely .    in this paper",
    "we extend the stirap protocol to an _",
    "n_-site tight - binding model and show that it is suitable for high fidelity robust multiple - range qst and quantum information swapping ( see schematic illustration in fig .",
    "the tight - binding quantum dot ( qd ) array with a single diagonal defect serves as the adiabatic pathway for two - way electronic transport .",
    "two external qds a , b represent information sender and receiver or vice versa are allowed to be flexibly side coupled to the array ( i.e. , qds a b can couple to different sites of the qd array as required by particular tasks ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the coupling parameters between the external qds and the corresponding sites on the array are made time dependent , which are controlled by the sender and receiver , respectively .",
    "we find that the ground state of the array is a bound state ( or localized state ) due to the existence of the defect .",
    "this allows us to show analytically that our system is an effective three - level system when the coupling between qd a ( b ) and the qd array are weak . as a consequence",
    "it is demonstrated that high fidelity two - way qst can be realized at various different distances between the sender and receiver .",
    "numerical results are also performed to illustrate that our scheme is robust against dephasing and small variations of the qd couplings and imperfections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the driven model is described and the tight - binding qd array system is analyzed in detail . in sec .",
    "iii , the multiple - range adiabatic transport scheme and its effective hamiltonian are discussed analytically .",

    "we start here with the structure of our proposal illustrated in figure 1 : the channel connecting the two side qds _ a _ and _ b _ is a one - dimensional tight - binding array with uniform and always - on exchange interactions and with one diagonal defect at @xmath5th site . the coupling between the qds a , b and their corresponding channel sites are made time dependent .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be written in the following structure :    [ h_t ] @xmath6where @xmath7 @xmath8 is the coupling strength between nearest neighboring qds along the channel ; @xmath9 is the time dependent coupling strength between @xmath10 and the @xmath11th site of the qd array and is controlled by the sender , while @xmath12 is the receiver controlled coupling strength between @xmath13 and site @xmath14 ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the on - site energy applied on the qds ; @xmath17 represents the wannier state localized in the @xmath18-th quantum site for @xmath19 . for convenience ,",
    "we consider the channel containing an odd number of qds and the gate voltage @xmath15 is applied on the central dot , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "note that equation ( 1 ) comprises three terms : the first corresponds to the tight - binding chain with defect at @xmath5-site , the second is the energy of qds a , b , and the third term describes the interaction hamiltonian . in this paper",
    "we study the electron transfer from qd-@xmath10 to qd-@xmath13 through the tight - binding array serving as quantum data bus , and we denote the transfer distance @xmath4 . in this proposal the propagation of the electron is driven by two time - dependent coupling strengths , i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath21 , which are modulated in sinusoidal pulses    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the prescribed duration of qst ; @xmath24 is the maximum tunnelling rates between the two external qd and the defected chain .",

    "<S> we propose a multiple - range quantum communication channel to realize coherent two - way quantum state transport with high fidelity . in our scheme , an information carrier ( a qubit ) and its remote partner </S>",
    "<S> are both adiabatically coupled to the same data bus , i.e. , an _ n_-site tight - binding chain that has a single defect at the center . at the weak interaction regime , </S>",
    "<S> our system is effectively equivalent to a three level system of which a coherent superposition of the two carrier states constitutes a dark state . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic coupling allows a well controllable information exchange timing via the dark state between the two carriers . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that our scheme is robust and efficient under practically inevitable perturbative defects of the data bus as well as environmental dephasing noise . </S>"
