    "observations of young stellar objects ( ysos ) envelopes reveal a rich variety of morphologies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "many of the observed features are associated with outflows : for example , strong high-@xmath3 co emission along a cavity , etched out by the outflow , is found in the class i object hh 46 ( @xcite ) .",
    "they explain the co narrow emission with a warm and fuv heated region , with fuv photons from either the bow shock , internal jet working surfaces or the accretion disk boundary layer . in this scenario",
    ", fuv radiation may travel freely in the low - density cavity without being absorbed or scattered .",
    "similarly , @xcite have observed molecular tracers for warm , dense and fuv irradiated gas along the outflow of the high - mass young stellar object afgl 2591 .",
    "since the line shape does not show clear signs of shocks , they suggest the fuv radiation to be of protostellar origin . indeed , the hot photosphere of a luminous young o or b star emits mostly at fuv wavelengths and a cavity that allows protostellar radiation to escape has also been observed in that source ( @xcite ) .    this scenario of irradiated outflow walls along a cavity , swept out by an outflow , has also been used to explain other observations . for example , @xcite found emission of fuv enhanced cn along an outflow of a low - mass class 0 source .",
    "van kempen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) explain the water maser emission at 183 ghz in ser smm 1 with the increased water abundance in the warm , fuv or shock heated outflow walls .",
    "outflow walls can also be sites of anomalous molecular excitation .",
    "for example @xcite observe strong emission of hcn and hco@xmath0 along the outflow of l 1527 and ser smm 1 .",
    "these molecules have a large dipole moment and are efficiently excited by collisions with electrons , mixed from the ionized outflow into the outflow wall .",
    "@xcite explain the strong hco@xmath0 emission by shock liberation of molecules from ice mantles followed by photoprocessing .",
    "@xcite model the strong @xmath4co @xmath5 emission in narrow lines observed toward several low - mass sources ( e.g. tmr-1 ) by fuv heated outflow walls .",
    "@xcite ( second paper of this series , hereafter paper ii ) explain the observed high abundance of the fuv enhanced molecule co@xmath0 in afgl 2591 by a concave cavity that allows direct irradiation onto the outflow walls .",
    "diatomic hydrides and their ions ( xh , xh@xmath0 ) are corner - stones of the chemical network",
    ". for example water at high temperature ( @xmath6 k ) is mainly formed by the reaction of oh + h@xmath7 . due to their chemical properties ,",
    "discussed in this work , they trace dense , warm and fuv or x - ray irradiated gas like in outflow walls .",
    "such tracers are valuable to constrain the fuv or x - ray radiation of embedded sources .",
    "this is of particular interest for the innermost part of low - mass ysos with protoplanetary disks being ionized and heated by fuv radiation and x - rays ( e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    ", we discuss the use of light diatomic hydrides with the common elements ( x = o , c , n , s ) as tracers of protstellar high - energy radiation . the chemistry of other diatomic hydrides with heavier ( e.g. x = fe ) and/or less abundant elements ( e.g. x = f ) is not discussed here , as their chemistry is poorly known and their use as tracers currently limited . however , with the ongoing search for new diatomic hydrides using the new herschel space observatory ( e.g.@xcite ) , this sitation may change .",
    "for example @xcite report the detection of hf using the hifi instrument onboard herschel . due to the dissociation energy of hf being larger than of h@xmath7",
    ", hf can be formed in an exothermic reaction of f with h@xmath7 and hf may become the dominant reservoir of fluorine ( @xcite ) .",
    "the silicon bearing sih and sih@xmath0 may be interesting in the context of shocked regions where `` sputtering '' from dust grains ( e.g. @xcite ) can increase the gas phase abundance of silicon .",
    "the herschel space observatory and band 10 receivers of the upcoming atacama large millimeter and submillimeter array ( alma ) allow the study of important fuv and x - ray tracers , like diatomic hydrides , at high sensitivity and with good spatial and spectral resolution for the first time .",
    "this raises the questions : what is the expected abundance and line flux of fuv enhanced species in the scenario of directly irradiated outflow walls ? from which region of the envelope does the molecular radiation emerge and how are the molecules excited ?",
    "how dependent are observable quantities ( line fluxes or line ratios ) on characteristics that can not be constrained directly from observations ( e.g. geometry in the innermost part of the envelope and chemical age ) ? to attack such questions , detailed numerical models of the chemistry of ysos envelopes can be used .",
    "models of the chemistry of yso envelopes have so far mostly assumed a slab or spherical symmetry and a static physical structure ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in situations with chemical timescales longer than dynamical timescales , the chemistry needs to be coupled with the dynamical evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) . a particular example for this situation is the slow sulfur chemistry ( @xcite ) .",
    "other models focus on the effect of protostellar fuv and x - ray radiation on the chemistry of a spherical envelope ( @xcite ) . due to the high extinction of fuv radiation by dust , they find the chemistry to be modified only in the innermost few hundred au .",
    "x - rays on the other hand , have a much lower absorption cross section . they may thus penetrate further into the envelope and dominate the ionization in the entire hot core . to study the effects of an outflow cavity that allows fuv radiation to escape and irradiate a larger part of the envelope , two - dimensional axisymmetric models are necessary .",
    "non - spherical chemical models of yso envelopes are presented by @xcite , @xcite and in paper ii .",
    "these models assume axisymmetry .",
    "the first two are applied on low - mass sources and include the effects of infall to study the chemical evolution from the cloud to the disk .",
    "the model in paper ii is applied on a high - mass star forming region .",
    "it calculates the gas temperature self - consistently with the chemical abundances similar to models of photo dominated regions ( pdrs ; e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , but it does not account for the dynamical evolution . the model presented in paper ii considers fuv ( @xmath1 ev ) and x - ray ( @xmath8 ev ) induced chemistry .    in this work ,",
    "we further develop the model introduced in paper ii .",
    "it is based on the grid of chemical models introduced in the first paper of this series of papers ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "we extend the model with two important tools : ( i ) with a dust radiative transfer method for a self - consistent calculation of the dust temperature and ( ii ) a multi - zone escape probability method to study the molecular excitation and radiation .",
    "we apply the model to afgl 2591 to answer the questions raised above .",
    "in particular we predict line fluxes of two selected diatomic hydrides ( sh and ch@xmath0 ) , having typical properties of diatomic hydrides with high temperatures needed for formation and high critical densities .",
    "these two molecules will be observed in afgl 2591 by the water in star - forming regions with herschel ( wish ; van dishoeck et al .",
    "2010 , in prep . )",
    "guaranteed time key program .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the details of the model in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the physical structure of different models is discussed in section [ sec : physstruc ] .",
    "the chemical abundances obtained from these physical structures are presented in section [ sec : chemabu ] , and compared to the results of one - dimensional models .",
    "the molecular excitation and line radiation is then studied in section [ sec : molline ] , and the scientific prospectives of hydride observations with herschel are discussed in [ sec : herschobs ] .",
    "limitations of the model used in this work are given in section [ sec : limit ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the calculation flow of the models used here .",
    "details on the new parts of the model , the dust radiative transfer and the molecular excitation calculation , are given in appendicies [ sec : dustrt ] and [ sec : molexcit ] , respectively .",
    "the modeling process starts with assuming a density structure and the spectrum of the central source .",
    "a dust radiative transfer calculation then solves for the dust temperature .",
    "the local fuv and x - ray radiation is calculated at every point of the model as described in appendix [ sec : dustrt ] . in the next step ,",
    "the gas temperature is obtained by equating the heating and cooling rates ( paper ii ) . since these rates depend on the chemical abundances ( e.g. of the atomic coolants c@xmath0 and o ) the calculation of the gas temperature has to be performed simultaneously with the chemistry .",
    "this time - consuming step is facilitated by the grid of chemical models introduced in paper i. the grid consists of a database of precalculated abundances depending on physical parameters ( density , temperature , fuv flux , x - ray flux , cosmic - ray ionization rate and chemical age ; see paper i for a definition of these parameters ) from which abundances can be interpolated quickly . the interpolation approach is also used to obtain the abundances of all other species ( e.g. diatomic hydrides ) .",
    "the molecular excitation is calculated using the escape probability approach described in appendix [ sec : molexcit ] and yields the modeled line radiation , thus the observable quantities",
    ".      a spherical model of afgl 2591 has been constructed by @xcite based on maps of the dust continuum , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and molecular line emission . in their fitting , they find good agreement on larger scales .",
    "however , continuum emission at shorter wavelengths ( warm dust ) requires a shallower density profile in the innermost @xmath9 .",
    "they conclude that an inner region with roughly constant temperature may be required to reproduce all observations .",
    "@xcite encountered similar problems of an excess emission in short wavelengths when fitting the continuum emission of iras 16293 - 2422 .",
    "they concluded that a large spherical cavity can explain this excess .",
    "however , @xcite can explain both sed and maps by a higher bolometric luminosity . in afgl 2591 , new high resolution observations at 24.5 @xmath10 m by @xcite show extended emission at scales of up to @xmath11 in the direction of the outflow .",
    "this emission stems from the outflow walls ( @xcite ) , supporting the scenario of a cavity .    for this work",
    ", we adopt the density structure of the spherical model by @xcite .",
    "this choice allows to study the differences of the two - dimensional chemical model including an outflow cavity with the spherically symmetric models by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cavity shape is assumed to follow a power - law with index @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are coordinates along the outflow axis and perpendicular to the outflow , respectively .",
    "the full opening angle @xmath16 of the outflow is given at a distance @xmath17 .",
    "as in paper ii , we use @xmath18 au , approximately the scale on which @xcite have probed the opening angle of the outflow cavity .",
    "cavity shapes for different choices of @xmath16 and @xmath12 are given in figure [ fig : separation ] .",
    "the solid line indicates the model used in paper ii .",
    "figure [ fig : separation ] also shows the line of sight toward us crossing the outflow wall at a shallow angle , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "a further parameter of the model is the density in the cavity , which we assume to be reduced by a constant factor @xmath19 compared to the spherical density model at the same radius .",
    "this is motivated by the pressure equilibirum along the outflow wall ( paper ii ) .",
    "note that for @xmath20 , used in most of the models , the results are independent of that assumption as the opacity in fuv wavelengths along the outflow is low .    ) .",
    "the line of sight suggested by @xcite is given by an arrow.[fig : separation ] ]    a grid of different models is discussed in the following sections .",
    "starting from the model used in paper ii ( referred as model _ standard _ in the following ) we explore the parameter range by varying the outflow opening angle @xmath16 , the power - law index @xmath12 , cavity density @xmath21 and the bolometric luminosity of the protostar @xmath22 ( table [ tab : modelsafgl ] ) . as in paper ii , we assume the central source to emit a black body spectrum with a temperature of @xmath23 k following @xcite ( see section [ sec : limit ] ) .",

    "the ch@xmath0 and sh molecules show typical properties of diatomic hydrides , with high critical densities ( @xmath29 @xmath30 for h@xmath7 collisions ) and large energy separation between subsequent levels .",
    "this is due to the large rotation constant combined with a large dipole moment .",
    "line frequencies thus mostly lie above the atmospheric windows .",
    "excitation mechanism other than collisional excitation are likely .",
    "for example , pumping by dust continuum radiation or formation in an excited state have been suggested by @xcite for ch@xmath0 .",
    "the calculated level populations of sh and ch@xmath0 at different positions of model _ standard _ are given in figure [ fig : plot_exci ] .",

    "this model allows to study the importance of dust pumping . *",
    "_ no radiation_. ambient radiation field switched off ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this model together with the previous allows to study the importance of pumping by line emission . *",
    "_ no collisions_. density of the collision partners set to zero .",
    "this situation corresponds to pumping purely by dust radiation . *",
    "_ lte_. level population in the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) with the gas temperature .",
    "this model is given for comparison as the assumption of lte is often made due to missing collision rates .",
    "* _ @xmath34 k , @xmath35 k ( only ch@xmath0)_. collisional excitation , radiative excitation and excited formation considered with formation temperature @xmath36 ( appendix [ sec : molexcit ] ) .",
    "we adopt a @xmath36 of order of the kinetic temperature ( 3000 k ) or much lower ( 100 k ) .    for sh , the population of the hyperfine quadruplet is combined .",
    "we note that the level population can only be translated directly to emissivity per volume in the case of optically thin radiation .",
    "figure [ fig : plot_excirad ] gives different components ( line emission , dust emission , cosmic microwave background and stellar photons ) of the ambient radiation field @xmath37 at positions a ( sh ) and c ( ch@xmath0 ) .         at positions a and c , respectively .",
    "the positions are given in figure [ fig : plot_exci ] . ]",
    "the ch@xmath0 level population is far out of lte .",
    "it peaks in the @xmath38 state in position c and the ground state in positions d and e. for all positions , the population rapidly decreases to higher @xmath3 levels and from position c to e for the same level .",
    "collisional excitation ( model _ no collisions _ ) governs the excitation with increasing differences to model _ all _ for higher @xmath3 .",
    "a model without electron excitation but collisions with h and h@xmath7 has level populations within 20 % to the model _",
    "electron excitation is thus unimportant relative to other effects .",
    "models _ no dust _ and _ no radiation _ differ less relative to model _ all _ in ch@xmath0 compared to sh , thus radiation is less important .",
    "unlike sh , the models _ no dust _ and _ no radiation _ differ , due to the contribution of line photons to the ambient radiation field . at position",
    "c , line photons dominate the radiation field up to the @xmath39 transition ( figure [ fig : plot_excirad ] right ) .",
    "optical depths of up to @xmath40 ( line and dust ) for vertical cuts through the outflow wall are reached in the lower @xmath3 transition . for levels connected by these transitions",
    ", we find the largest differences between models _ no dust _ and _ no radiation_. we conclude that ch@xmath0 is mainly collisionally excited with small contributions from pumping by line trapping and dust radiation .",
    "the importance of collisions for the excitation of ch@xmath0 despite the density of the collision partners below the critical density can be understood by the high kinetic temperature .",
    "radiative transitions connect only levels with @xmath41 due to selection rules .",
    "rates for radiative pumping are proportional to the lower level population of a pumping transition and thus decrease quickly to higher @xmath3 .",
    "collisional excitation is not restricted to @xmath42 and can pump over several levels , especially for high kinetic temperatures , when the upward rates are similar or even higher than the downward rates ( @xmath43 ) .    at position c in the model _ standard",
    "_ , the radiative excitation rate decreases from about @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) to @xmath46 @xmath30 s@xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , for @xmath49 and @xmath50 of order 0.1 s@xmath47 and a ch@xmath0 density of 0.4 @xmath30 .",
    "the collisional excitation rates from the most populated levels ( @xmath51 ) to a higher level is found to be about @xmath52 s@xmath47 @xmath30 into @xmath53 and slightly less for higher @xmath3 , for rate coefficients @xmath54 of order a few times @xmath55 @xmath56 s@xmath47 and a density of @xmath57 @xmath30 .",
    "thus , for @xmath53 , radiative and collisional rates are similar , but collisions dominate for higher @xmath3 .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings in the previous paragraphs .",
    "excited formation affects the level population relatively little with considerable differences only for higher @xmath3 levels at lower densities ( position e ) and a high formation temperature ( @xmath58 k ) . at position",
    "c , the total formation rate of ch@xmath0 is @xmath59 s@xmath47 @xmath30 , larger than the collisional excitation , but the effect on the level population is small due to the distribution over different levels following the boltzmann statistic . due to this distribution , which supports the thermalization to the formation temperature , the influence of excited formation is mostly seen in higher @xmath3 levels for @xmath58 k , where collisional excitation competes less with molecules formed in an excited state .",
    "observation of the @xmath60 up to @xmath5 of ch@xmath0 using the infrared space observatory ( iso ) have been reported by @xcite towards the planetary nebula ngc 7027 .",
    "they can be explained by a single excitation temperature of @xmath61 k for a kinetic temperature of about 300 - 500 k and densities of a few times @xmath57 @xmath30 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , at position c of our model , the level population up to @xmath62 can be well fitted by a single boltzmann distribution with a temperature of 129 k. note that @xcite have used n@xmath7h@xmath0 collision rates and a slightly higher density .",
    "our calculation thus suggests that the observed line ratio can be explained even with a much higher kinetic temperature as is required for the formation .",
    "a more detailed model of their source is however required to draw further conclusions .",
    "the sh level population is out of lte like ch@xmath0 .",
    "the molecule is however destroyed by fuv radiation and thus abundant in regions with lower temperatures compared to ch@xmath0 .",
    "the level population is thus concentrated in the ground state for both positions a and b. levels of the @xmath63 ladder with level energy above 500 k are sparsely populated with relative population below @xmath64 .",
    "the agreement of the model _ no collisions _ with the model _ all _ in the @xmath65 states indicates that these level are pumped by dust radiation .",
    "the @xmath63 states on the other hand are connected by lines with lower frequency and thus weaker dust radiation field .",
    "these levels are pumped by both collisions and dust radiation .",
    "calculated line fluxes of sh and ch@xmath0 for different models are given in table [ tab : mol_flux ] .",
    "synthetic frequency integrated maps and spectra at selected positions for the @xmath66 and @xmath5 lines of the model _ standard _ are shown in figure [ fig : mapspec ] .",

    "inclination affects the line flux by the combination of line and dust opacity , together with the beam containing different parts of the model .",
    "for example , the dust opacity reaches about 1.2 for the @xmath90 line , while it is below 0.07 for the @xmath91 line .",
    "thus , the flux of the @xmath5 line in the model _ standard ( 90@xmath79 ) _ ( edge on ) is about a factor of two smaller compared to the model _ standard ( 0@xmath79 ) _ with a line of sight parallel to the outflow . compared to the model _ standard _ , the inclination changes the flux mostly by less than 40 % .",

    "this is also reflected in a model ( _ standard ( 25.9  ) _ ) , convolved to a 25.8  beam .",
    "the flux ratios of that model to model _ standard _ decreases almost as fast as the beam dilution factor , indicating that most of the emission is within the beam .",
    "the profile of the @xmath91 line shows considerable self - absorption in the region where the line of sight follows the outflow wall due to the opening angle being similar to the inclination ( positions a and b ) .",
    "the optical depth at the line center at these positions are 7 ( a ) and 19 ( b ) .",
    "further out , the optical depth is about 3 ( c ) , which is about twice the value found in the section [ sec : molexci ] for a ray crossing the outflow wall once .",
    "the optical depth is even small for distances larger than position c. the @xmath90 line has much smaller line optical depths below 0.2 ( position a ) compared to the @xmath91 line .",
    "beam convolved spectra of both lines however , do not show a self - absorption dip , suggesting that most of the emission comes from regions with moderate optical depth .",
    "the considerable line optical depths for lines of sight along the outflow walls raises the question , how much the modeled line fluxes depend on the assumed intrinsic line shape and velocity structure .",
    "hifi can observe the @xmath91 and @xmath92 lines of ch@xmath0 spectrally resolved but with a beam corresponding to more than 10000 au at the assumed distance of 1 kpc .",
    "this is insufficient to directly probe the velocity structure along the outflow wall .",
    "it can however be used to constrain the average line width along the outflow wall .",
    "spatially resolved interferometric observations reveal broader lines in the outflow wall without much velocity shift to the systemic velocity ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has been implemented in model _ standard _ ( appendix [ sec : molexcit ] ) . a model without increased microturbulence in the outflow walls ( _ standard ( noturb ) _",
    ") has been calculated and shows total line fluxes within 20 % to model _ standard_.",
    "we conclude that the while the modeled line shape may depend strongly on the assumed intrinsic line and velocity structure , the line fluxes are pretty independent .",
    "different chemical models ( _ @xmath1620 _ , _ @xmath16100 _ and _ disk _ ) affect the line fluxes of ch@xmath0 by a combination of the chemical abundance , the temperature and density structure and also the beam containing different regions of the model . for example the total amount of ch@xmath0 in the models _ @xmath1620 _ , _",
    "@xmath16100 _ and _ disk _ within 4000 au relative to the model _ standard _ are 0.64 , 0.36 and 1.04 , respectively ( tables [ tab : avgmods1 ] and [ tab : avgmods2 ] ) .",
    "the line fluxes relative to model _ standard _ are thus similar to the abundance ratios for models _",
    "@xmath1620 _ and _ disk _ in low-@xmath3 lines . for _",
    "@xmath16100 _ , the line is however much stronger due to the larger mass with high temperature ( table [ tab : propafgl ] ) . for higher @xmath3 lines , the situation is different .",
    "the lines of the model _ disk _ get weaker with @xmath3 relative to model _ standard _ , while those of model _ @xmath1620",
    "_ get stronger .",
    "this is due to the fact , that the abundance of ch@xmath0 decreases in model _ disk _ in regions with high density , while in the model _",
    "@xmath1620 _ more material with high density",
    "is heated by fuv .",
    "we conclude that the low-@xmath3 lines of ch@xmath0 are better tracers for the chemical abundance than higher @xmath3 lines , as the higher @xmath3 lines depend more on the temperature structure .",
    "the difference between the models is of order of about 3 , similar to the uncertainty of the chemical model .",
    "details of the geometry can thus not be obtained solely by observations of diatomic hydrides .",
    "the sh lines are very weak , with most line fluxes clearly below the detection limit .",
    "this is remarkable since the volume averaged abundance of sh ( table [ tab : avgstd1d2d ] ) is only about two orders of magnitude smaller than for ch@xmath0 .",
    "the weak fluxes can be explained by the poor excitation in regions with high abundance of sh , due to the large energy separation of the levels ( section [ sec : molexci ] ) .",
    "lines of the @xmath63 ladder with upper level energies of several 100 k have line fluxes below @xmath93 k km s@xmath47 . lines between @xmath65 states can reach line fluxes of a few times @xmath44 k km s@xmath47 owing to their level energies similar to the dust or gas temperature in regions where sh is abundant .",
    "these lines can also be seen in absorption if a sufficient column density of cold dust lies between the sh emitting region and the observer .",
    "unfortunately , this feature is most prominent in the @xmath94 line at 1383 ghz which can not be observed by pacs or hifi .    the abundance of sh within 4000 au of the models _ @xmath1620 _ , _ @xmath16100 _ and _ disk _ relative to model _ standard _ are 180 , 0.04 and 23 ( tables [ tab : avgmods1 ] and [ tab : avgmods2 ] ) .",
    "this is only reflected in lines of the @xmath65 levels which are excited in larger parts of the envelope compared to the @xmath63 levels .",
    "because of the larger amount of warm material , lines obtained from model _ @xmath16100 _ can be stronger than from the model _ standard _ despite the lower abundance .",
    "we conclude that the excitation in the warm region of the fuv outflow walls is essential for observable lines of diatomic hydrides .",
    "thus , observations or non - detections do not necessarily reflect column densities , due to high critical densities combined with large energy separations between subsequent energy levels .",
    "the previous sections have shown that light diatomic hydrides ( ch , nh , sh , oh ) and their ions belong to a particular class of molecules that are expected to probe the outflow walls of yso envelopes .",
    "this is due to three factors relating to formation and excitation of the diatomic hydrides : i. ) owing to considerable activation barriers for the formation of many of the diatomic hydrides , a high temperature of several 100 k is needed for their formation .",
    "the chemical network leading to the formation is initiated by photoionization and large fuv fields are required for the formation of diatomic hydrides .",
    "iii . ) due to high critical densities and a large energy separation between the molecular levels , a high density and temperature is needed for excitation of the diatomic hydrides .",
    "protostellar fuv radiation can escape through a low density cavity , etched out by the outflow , and irradiate the outflow walls separating the outflow and envelope .",
    "our work predicts the abundance and excitation of diatomic hydrides in this thin outflow walls to govern the total line flux and result in fluxes that can be easily detected .",
    "diatomic hydrides thus are predicted to be valuable tracers for the chemistry and physics of the outflow walls , which are in many ways similar to the upper atmosphere of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the herschel space observatory provides a unique opportunity to observe diatomic hydrides , as their lines are above atmospheric windows . beyond the relatively large sample of hydride lines in the hifi spectral range , which is targeted by the wish herschel guaranteed time key program in this source , pacs observations of higher @xmath3 lines",
    "may yield important constraints on the hottest regions .",
    "a particular example are high-@xmath3 lines of ch@xmath0 which are predicted to be detectable by pacs . for this particular source ,",
    "the relatively large beam of herschel does not allow to spatially resolve the outflow walls and our model do also not indicate that the predicted line fluxes can be used easily as tracer for the exact shape of the cavity .",
    "in other sources with a good balance between distance and affected outflow area ( e.g serpens - firs 1 ) , the good spatial resolution of the pacs camera may allow to spatially resolve different transitions of ch@xmath0 .",
    "the upcoming atacama large millimeter and submillimeter array ( alma ) can observe diatomic hydrides at very high angular resolution using band 10 receivers ( 787 - 950 ghz ) .",
    "for example the @xmath91 line of the @xmath95 isotope is shifted sufficiently to be inside an atmospheric window ( @xcite ) .",
    "also oh@xmath0 at 909 ghz ( @xcite ) and sh@xmath0 at 893 ghz ( @xcite ) have been detected from ground .",
    "furthermore , lines of nh ( 946 ghz ) and sh ( 866 and 875 ghz ) are observable with alma band 10 receivers .",
    "herschel observations can thus be complemented in the near future with high - resolution interferometric data to constrain parameters like the geometry in the innermost region .",
    "the scenario of directly irradiated outflow walls by radiation of the protostar is not the only possible to alter the chemical composition in the outflow walls .",
    "for example mixing between the warm and ionized outflow with the envelope has been suggested by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the observed abundance of co@xmath0 , however , can not be explained by mixing solely ( paper ii ) .",
    "major dissociative shocks may occur at the boundary layer between outflow and inflow and produce fuv radiation that irradiates the quiescent envelope . to replace the fuv field of direct protostellar radiation with shocks",
    ", a rather high shock velocity is required .",
    "for example , in the model _ standard _ at @xmath31 au , @xmath96 km s@xmath47 is required ( @xcite ) .",
    "such conditions are clearly met for the bow shock or internal jet working surfaces . along the outflow walls",
    ", however , the velocity perpendicular to the quiescent envelope is likely smaller . in the simple model of the couette flow solution ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "neglecting turbulence , the mean velocity in the entrainment / mixing is along the outflow cavity and depends linearly on the distance to the cavity edge . the width of this layer and the substructure of the velocity including turbulences are however not easily constrained .",
    "observationally , no clear signs of shocks in the outflow walls have been found in interferometric observations of afgl 2591 by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that further study of the combined effects of mixing and shocks is warranted , especially in the context of low - mass star formation with less or cooler protostellar fuv radiation .",
    "several simplifications have been made to make the calculation feasible . as discussed above ,",
    "the physical structure does not account for shocks and mixing in the outflow layer or a clumpy surface of the outflow wall .",
    "the chemical models used here do not consider non - thermal desorption ( e.g. photodesorption ) .",
    "the photodesorption yields are not well known for many species .",
    "however , the change in abundance at the 100 k evaporation temperature of h@xmath7o , co@xmath7 and h@xmath7s is small in the presence of a strong fuv field such as in the outflow wall .",
    "thus the photodesorption would not affect the results of the outflow wall enhanced species considerably .",
    "the drop of the water abundance in the region with fuv irradiation but temperatures below 100 k would be mitigated by photodesorption .",
    "fuv dissociation and ionization processes are treated here in the rate approach which does not allow to specify the protostellar radiation field explicitly .",
    "the surface temperature of the protostar is however not well constrained by observations and would affect the chemistry if the temperature were not hot enough to dissociate co ( @xcite ) .",
    "the models do not account for vibrationally excited h@xmath7 ( e.g. @xcite ) which may help to overcome the activation barrier and further increase the abundance of e.g. ch@xmath0 or oh . grain surface reactions , except for h@xmath7 formation and charge exchange with grains , are not considered in the models . for species with longer chemical timescales ( chemical clocks , e.g. many sulfur bearing species , @xcite ) the effects of infall must be taken into account .",
    "we have used a detailed chemical model of the high - mass star - forming region afgl 2591 to study the effect of different shapes of a concave low - density cavity on the chemistry .",
    "the cavity , etched out by the outflow , allows fuv radiation to escape the innermost region and irradiate the walls between outflow and envelope .",
    "we study especially those molecules that are newly observable with the hifi / pacs instrument onboard herschel and in particular light diatomic hydrides ( ch , nh , sh , oh ) . the model used in this work is based on the two - dimensional axisymmetric chemical model introduced in @xcite , extended by a self - consistent calculation of the dust temperature and an escape probability method to calculate the molecular excitation .",
    "the model considers protostellar fuv and x - ray irradiation and makes use of the grid of chemical models presented in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of the work are :    1 .   protostellar fuv radiation can enhance the abundance of light diatomic hydrides and their ions by photoionization / dissociation processes and heating in the outflow - walls considerably .",
    "the overall amount of ch@xmath0 , oh@xmath0 and nh@xmath0 in the envelope is orders of magnitude larger than in spherically symmetric geometry ( section [ sec : chemabu ] ) .",
    "similarly enhanced are c@xmath0 and h@xmath7o@xmath0 .",
    "these species thus appear to be clear tracers of extended fuv irradiation and thus the geometric structure of the inner regions of ysos .",
    "2 .   depending whether the vertical height of the envelope from the midplane to the outflow ( geometrically thin or thick ) , the size and mass of the infrared heated hot - core region with temperature above 100 k , but no fuv irradiation , can change substantially ( section [ sec : physstruc ] ) . geometrically thin inner regions allows fuv radiation to penetrate to the midplane and destroy the bulk of important species such as co@xmath7 and h@xmath7o .",
    "the shape of the cavity is thus also important for species which are destroyed by fuv radiation ( section [ sec : phyxrayfuv ] and [ sec : compmods ] ) .",
    "3 .   provided that fuv radiation can escape the innermost region , the effects of different geometries ( opening angle of the outflow , cavity shape , density in the cavity ) on the total amount of species enhanced in the outflow - wall ( ch , ch@xmath0 , oh@xmath0 , nh@xmath0 , c@xmath0 and h@xmath7o@xmath0 ) are relatively small .",
    "deviations are typically less than a factor of three ( section [ sec : compmods ] ) .",
    "4 .   in outflow walls ,",
    "the influence of protostellar x - ray irradiation on the chemistry and in particular on the diatomic hydrides is relatively small with respect to the much larger enhancement by fuv radiation ( section [ sec : xdrivchem ] ) .",
    "the large separation between the energy levels of diatomic hydrides requires a hot and dense gas for excitation .",
    "thus , the line fluxes of ch@xmath0 , predicted to be enhanced in the hot outflow wall , reach fluxes of several k km s@xmath47 even in the @xmath90 line .",
    "on the other hand , sh , is predicted to be destroyed in the outflow wall , but to be abundant in the envelope .",
    "thus , despite the volume averaged abundance of sh being only two orders of magnitude lower than for ch@xmath0 , it is not sufficiently excited in the cool envelope to be detectable ( section [ sec : molexci ] and [ sec : lineflux ] ) .",
    "excited formation of ch@xmath0 does not considerably affect observable line fluxes .",
    "exceptions are high-@xmath3 lines , if a large formation temperature is assumed and the ambient density is low ( section [ sec : molexci ] and [ sec : lineflux ] ) .",
    "this suggests that diatomic hydrides are important tracers of warm and fuv irradiated material .",
    "diatomic hydrides are chemically closely related to important species like water .",
    "studying diatomic hydrides will provide important insight in the chemistry of yso envelopes .",
    "not only the chemistry of the diatomic hydrides is interesting , as they may ultimately also be used a tracers for physical conditions ( like the fuv radiation ) .",
    "herschel will for the first time observe diatomic hydrides with a good sensitivity and angular resolution and making these tracers available .",
    "alma and in particular band 10 will allow to continue the study of diatomic hydrides at very high angular resolution .",
    "since diatomic hydrides have not been studied thoroughly in the past , much molecular data and in particular collisional excitation rates are missing .",
    "more studies on these processes will be necessary in order to analyse herschel observations .    in this series of papers ( @xcite and this work ) , we have introduced a fast method for chemical modeling of envelopes of young stellar objects and studying the molecular excitation .",
    "the numerical speed up allows to construct more detailed models including multidimensional geometries .",
    "the method will also facilitate the study of larger samples of observations as they will soon be available by new facilities with high sensitivity and larger spectral coverage as for example the upcoming atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array .",
    "ultimately , extensions of the methods presented here may also be useful to study the chemical / physical evolution of protoplanetary disks .",

    "the dust radiative transfer code also calculates the local mean intensity of scattered and attenuated stellar photons with a monte carlo method similar to @xcite . the analytical expression for the photodissociation and ionization rates ( e.g. @xcite ) implemented in paper i require the calculation of the unattenuated fuv flux @xmath106 [ isrf ] and the visual extinction @xmath107 .",
    "we estimate these quantities by the mean intensities at both edges of the fuv band ( 6 and 13.6 ev ) and at 1 micron . we have tested the approach by comparing photoionization and dissociation rates obtained from the fit and calculated by the fuv cross sections of @xcite .",
    "we find agreement within a factor of two in the chemically relevant range of attenuation ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "this is reasonable provided that we do not implement the same dust properties and spectral shape of the emitting spectra ( see section [ sec : limit ] for a discussion of the spectral shape ) .",
