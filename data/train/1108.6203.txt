    "a solar flare is a rapid and transient release of energy in the solar corona , associated with electromagnetic radiation from radio waves to @xmath0-rays , local plasma heating to tens of mk , particles accelerated to  gev , violent mass plasma motions , and shock waves . in the largest events , a spectacular variety of phenomena",
    "can be studied in detail across many wavelength ranges to try to understand the processes involved ( see examples in * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray emission observed is of particular interest as it shows the accelerated particles and intense heating , and therefore provides the most direct insights into the physics of the basic energy release .",
    "hard x - rays ( hxrs ) , from about 10  kev to hundreds of  kev , are primarily produced via thick - target bremsstrahlung @xcite in which the coronal accelerated electrons are stopped instantaneously through coulomb collisions with denser material in the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "soft x - rays ( sxrs ) , typically the component below tens of kev , are thermal emission ( lines and continua ) by plasma of a few to tens of mk",
    ". this emission results to some extent from heating at the site of energy release , but mainly from new coronal material evaporated from the chromosphere during the impulsive phase ( see * ? ? ?",
    "given the wealth of x - ray flare data , it is possible to study large samples of these events , allowing the statistics of the events to provide clues to the underlying processes behind the emission .",
    "this article reviews such flare studies , the results , interpretation and limitations , from a predominantly x - ray viewpoint .",
    "in particular , we discuss the advances that have been made in extending this analysis to weaker hxr events ( _ microflares _ ) using the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) _",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of flare surveys is the range of magnitudes these transient phenomena span .",
    "the observed  sxr flux extends over five orders of magnitude ( see figure  [ fig : hannah_goesdist ] ) and over nine orders of magnitude in energy ( see figure  [ fig : hannah_eng ] ; we return to discuss these figures in detail in section  [ sec : hannah_obsdist ] ) .",

    "the quantity @xmath7 is the fraction of events per unit time releasing energy between @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "this power - law nature of the frequency distribution has long been observed , first noticed in solar radio bursts by @xcite .",
    "the fact that so many of the flare characteristics have such a distribution is thought to arise from the corona being in a self - organized critical state @xcite , discussed further in section  [ sec : hannah_whyapowlaw ] . here",
    ", the underlying energy release from the largest to the smallest flares occurs as an `` avalanche , '' similar to the theory for earthquake occurrence or stress relief in general @xcite .",
    "these properties have brought forth interesting interpretations .",
    "the power - law distribution means that small flares are more numerous .",
    "could these weaker events at the currently unobservable `` nanoflare '' magnitude level ( about @xmath9 times the energy of a large flares ) directly constitute the hot corona , thus explaining its heating ? this is often called parker s nanoflare mechanism @xcite .",
    "the answer to this question requires knowledge of the total power that is contained in the flare distribution , i.e.    @xmath10.\\ ] ]    since @xmath11 by definition , we can see that in the case @xmath12 in equation ( [ eqn : hannah_totpow ] ) the low - energy half of the distribution would contain the most energy @xcite .",
    "in this situation the smallest flares fit the requirement for heating the corona as they have a high occurrence rate and release more net energy than the large flares .",
    "therefore , to understand the role of flares in coronal heating , the power - law index @xmath13 has to be accurately estimated ; this is problematic as the energy is inferred from observations and thus subject to potentially large errors and biases .",
    "in addition , equation  ( [ eqn : hannah_totpow ] ) assumes that the distributions continue into the unobservable low - energy range .",
    "even if the deduced @xmath13 were large enough ( i.e. , larger than two ) , that would not automatically mean that small flares heat the corona .",
    "for further proof we would require observations showing the power - law index to maintain its value down to the distribution s physical limit , rather than its observational limit .",

    "the first detailed analysis on individual _ rhessi _ microflares ( a- and b - class flares ) found that the steepness of their spectra results in considerable power in the these low - energy electrons , but only estimated the energy above 25 kev at @xmath98  erg @xcite . in a larger study of microflares , where the observed break found in the photon spectrum was used as the cutoff energy , the nonthermal energy ranged over @xmath99  erg @xcite .",
    "this gives an overestimate in the energy since @xmath72@xmath100 , and using slightly larger values for @xmath71 produced typical nonthermal energies of about @xmath101 erg , similar to the thermal energies found . in the largest _ rhessi",
    "_ microflare study @xcite the thermal and nonthermal energies at about the time of peak emission over @xmath49  kev were found to be similar , to within an order of magnitude , once an empirical correction factor had been used to convert the measured @xmath72 to @xmath71 .",
    "this factor was found by fitting a broken power laws to model thick - target spectra with a range of indices and low energy cutoffs .",
    "further discussion on the calculation of flare energy and the associated issues is given in @xcite .",
    "the distribution of these _ rhessi _ microflare values is shown in figure  [ fig : hannah_eng ] , in comparison to previous hxr nonthermal energy distributions @xcite , microflares from the sxr thermal distribution @xcite and the thermal distribution of euv nanoflares .",
    "@xcite although such a figure nicely shows the scaling of nanoflares through microflares to large flares , and is crucial for determining coronal heating , it is dangerously deceptive",
    ". each of these distributions was found for a different type of event , using various instruments and for different periods during the solar cycle , and so each will be affected by different types of selection effect and biases .",
    "for instance , the sxt energies @xcite are from 291 brightenings in one active region over five days in 1992 august , whereas the _ rhessi _ microflare energies @xcite are from 9161 events taken over five years , march 2002 to march 2007 .",
    "this is a comparison of probably the same type of event but even then they are still observed at different wavelengths and over different time periods .",
    "extending this comparison to euv nanoflares is very difficult and may not even be appropriate given that we do not know if these are similar events or completely distinct physical processes .",
    "when looking at the actual values of @xmath13 that these distributions provide , we see the striking observational result that flare peak flux distributions are power laws flatter than @xmath102 , a result that goes back at least to @xcite .",
    "this appears to exclude nanoflares as the source of coronal heating @xcite . on the other hand , distributions that attempt to reflect the event energies",
    "themselves have often found steeper spectra that are consistent with parker s idea .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath13 ranged from 2.1 to 2.6 for different model assumptions but was consistently in the @xmath212 range .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath13 was between 2.3 and 2.6 but later showed that these values and those from other euv nanoflare studies were highly dependent on the flare selection criteria @xcite .",
    "so , could selection effects be responsible for this discrepancy between nanoflare and larger flare distributions ?",
    "attempts have been made to recover the intrinsic distributions from the observationally derived ones @xcite using a technique similar to that applied to malmquist bias , a threshold selection effect that biases galaxy number counts in cosmology .",
    "in this situation , the counting statistics are biased because the brighter , more distant galaxies are more likely to be counted than the fainter ones .",
    "this malmquist - bias procedure has been used on the thermal energies derived for euv nanoflares ; it takes the means and covariances of the observed data parameters and iterates them back to the intrinsic unbiased values . to do this requires model assumptions about how the parameters required to calculate the thermal energy , in equation [ eq : therm ] , relate to each other , so that the probability distribution of the intrinsic distribution can be analytically described .",
    "however , determining how these parameters scale is , in itself , subject to biases and selection effects , as discussed in section [ sec : hannah_thermal ] .",
    "the analysis procedure may then only adjust the scalings and not test whether the parameters actually relate in such a manner . attempting to recover the intrinsic distributions , free of instrumental and selection effect biases",
    ", should certainly be the priority of any study deriving flare distributions , but in practice this does not readily appear to be practicable given that the parameter of greatest interest , the energy , is not directly obtainable from the existing observations .",
    "an alternative approach of determining flare energy , which is much less prone to these effects , is to measure the luminous component directly via the resulting change in the total solar irradiance ( tsi ) .",
    "this has been done for the x17 event sol2003 - 10 - 28t11:10 using the tim ( total irradiance monitor ) instrument on the _ solar irradiance and climate experiment ( sorce ) _",
    "@xcite , which is sensitive to the solar emission from x - rays to far infrared .",
    "the estimated total luminous energy for this flare was approximately @xmath103  erg @xcite .",
    "this technique is only appropriate at present for the largest flares , because of competition from other sources of solar variation .    given the evidence so far , it does not appear that flare - like events can heat the quiescent corona .",
    "moreover it seems that making the comparison of active - region and quiet - corona flare events is unwise given that these transient events have different populations in appear in different physical environments @xcite .",
    "the _ rhessi _ data have allowed us to study microflares effectively while using the same instrumentation for major events .",
    "the statistical study of solar flares has great importance in understanding the underlying processes involved in the energy release and subsequent emission we observe in the solar corona .",
    "often , emphasis is placed on detailed multi - wavelength studies of individual events .",
    "such studies have their merits in revealing insights to the processes in these events .",
    "however without being able to place the flare in context of other events , it is very difficult to determine whether it is typical or unusual behavior that is being studied . only by studying events in large numbers with a minimum of selection bias",
    "can one really approach an understanding of the general physics .",
    "the discovery that `` ordinary '' flare physics extends down to the tiniest events observable by _ rhessi _ ( or by _ goes _ ) allows us to conclude that such events do not explain coronal heating .",
    "even the smallest events _ rhessi _ observes are in the active regions and are flare - like , distinguishable as individual events . the nanoflare hypothesis instead requires an apparently continuous flare population that is many orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "they also continue to show the flat peak - flux scaling that puts most of the energy in the most powerful events , rather than the weakest ones . in a sense",
    ", this conclusion simply confirms the appearance of the _ goes _ data  sometimes flare - dominated , and sometimes showing steady emission .",
    "this is inconsistent with the universality of the flat flare power - law distribution .",
    "of course , numerous individually unobservable nanoflares could create the apparently steady emissions .    to make further progress in this field , three crucial things have to happen .",
    "firstly , we need spacecraft that have a higher sensitivity , lower background and wider dynamic range than _ rhessi _ while maintaining the energy range covered across both imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "this would allow the faintest events in active regions and the quiet sun , as well as the fainter emission components of large flares , to be confidently analyzed .",
    "one such suitable implementation would be a hxr focusing - optics telescope dedicated to solar observations .",
    "second , we must understand better how biased our observations are , and how we can obtain the intrinsic unbiased physics from our observations .",
    "this will require a third advance , more sophisticated modeling of these faint events to match improvements in the data and their implications .",
    "the authors thank the editor ( b. r. dennis ) and the two referees for providing many constructive comments that have greatly improved this review .",
    "igh would also like to thank the glasgow ssh ( solar self help ) group for their comments .",
    "this work is financially supported through nasa contract nas 5 - 98033 , an stfc rolling grant , and by the european commission through the solaire network ( mtrn - ct-2006 - 035484 ) , and all are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "jk acknowledges support from grant 205/06/p135 of the ga cr and the research plan av0z10030501 .",
    "for a power - law distribution ( equation  [ eqn : hannah_powlawdef ] ) , the standard way to determine the index @xmath13 is to perform a linear fit to the log - log histogram of the data .",
    "however this is a highly subjective approach as there is considerable choice as to the `` best '' bin width and fitting method .",
    "an alternative and more objective approach is to estimate the power - law index using the maximum - likelihood method @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to a remarkably simple calculation on the sample to determine the index above some chosen threshold :      in this example , the energies @xmath6 are used , where @xmath105 is the total number of events and @xmath106 is the energy of the @xmath107 event normalized by a threshold energy of @xmath108 .",
    "the error in this most likely value of @xmath109 can be estimated @xcite as      the observed distribution , however , is often affected by instrumental and selection effects , resulting in a deviation from a power law , so fitting a power law alone would be unwise .",
    "a common problem is that the smallest events are hard to detect and analyze successfully , resulting in a flattening of the power - law for these missing smallest events . to fit this",
    "observed biased distribution a skew - laplace distribution can be used instead of a single power law @xcite .",
    "this fits the desired power - law distribution for the larger events , but below some critical value , a power law with a different index is fitted to the under - reported smallest events .",
    "the determination of the parameters of this skew - laplace distribution again can be found using a maximum likelihood estimation method @xcite .        where @xmath112 is the shape parameter and @xmath113 is the scale parameter .",
    "for a shape parameter @xmath1141 , the resulting distribution is similar to a power law , but it turns over at the smallest and largest events .",
    "this can then represent deficiencies in the smallest and largest events .",
    "again , the under - reporting of the smallest events is likely to arise from instrumental sensitivity and selection effect bias .",
    "the largest events may be missing due to the limited dynamic range of the instrument , if these events saturate the detector ; or , there might actually be fewer of these events if a critical physical upper limit is being reached ( for instance maximum energy available in an active region @xcite .",
    "such a feature is consistent with the predictions of avalanche models @xcite , as discussed in section [ sec : hannah_whyapowlaw ] .",
    "the parameters of this weibull distribution can be determined again using the maximum likelihood method @xcite .",
    "as there are several distributions that could successfully fit the data , a statistical test is needed to determine which is best .",
    "such a test is the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic ( ks ) , which is the maximum difference between the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) and the empirical distribution function ( edf ) @xcite . for a data set of , energies @xmath6 ,",
    "the cdf for the @xmath107 energy @xmath106 is the integral of the pdf , using the fitted parameters , to @xmath106 .",
    "the edf is derived from the observed / calculated parameters and in this example is the number of events with energy less than or equal to @xmath106 , which turns out to be @xmath115 .",
    "the ks statistic then provides a measure of the significance level of each distribution @xcite . plotting cdf versus edf provides a graphical way of determining how consistently the data belong to the chosen distribution .",
    "a graph similar to the familiar histogram can be obtained by plotting @xmath116  cdf and edf against the event parameters ( i.e. , energy ) .",
    "a detailed example of using the maximum likelihood method to determine the parameters , and testing the goodness of the fit using the ks statistic for power - law and weibull distributions in the solar context , is given in @xcite .",
