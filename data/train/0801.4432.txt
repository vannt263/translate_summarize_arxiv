    "let @xmath40 be the area of @xmath37 , let @xmath41 be the number of integer points on the boundary of @xmath37 , and let @xmath42 be the number of integer points in the interior of @xmath37 . pick s famous theorem @xcite ( also see ( * ? ? ?",

    "if we let @xmath51 denote the number of integer points in the interior of @xmath48 , then becomes @xmath52 we know that the number of integer points of @xmath48 is @xmath53 , so by adding @xmath54 to both sides of , we find that the total number of integer points @xmath55 of @xmath48 is @xmath56 the right - hand side is a quadratic polynomial in @xmath9 .",

    "however , a bit should be said about how one might generalize pick s theorem .",
    "for example , can one compute the volume of a 3-dimensonal polyhedron by counting its integer points ?",
    "the answer is no , and comes in the form of an example :    [ reeveexample ] let @xmath60 be the tetrahedron whose vertices are the points @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for @xmath65 ; its base is the triangle whose vertices are the first three points mentioned .",
    "the volume of @xmath60 is @xmath66 times the area of the base times the height , which is @xmath67 .",
    "this comes out to @xmath68 .",
    "it is not hard to see that the only integer points inside of @xmath60 are the four points mentioned above : a general point @xmath69 looks like @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ". then if @xmath73 , we have to have @xmath74 .",
    "but if any of them is 1 , then the other three coefficients must be 0 , and if they are all 0 , then @xmath28 is the origin .",
    "so we are left with the fact that @xmath60 _ always _ has 4 integer points but the volume grows arbitrarily large as @xmath67 tends to infinity .",
    "thus , no higher - dimensional analogue of pick s theorem can hold .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this example was first used by john reeve in 1957 ( see @xcite ) to show that the idea of computing area from counting integer points does not generalize to 3 dimensions . for the reader who comes back to this example",
    ", its ehrhart polynomial is @xmath75 so @xmath76 has negative coefficients in its ehrhart polynomial .",
    "nevertheless , there is a theorem ( theorem [ ehrharttheorem ] ) , now called ehrhart s theorem , which is , in a vague sense , the correct way to generalize pick s theorem to higher dimensions .",
    "it was proven by eugne ehrhart , who was not a professional mathematician .",
    "he spent most of his life teaching mathematics in high schools in france and did his research on the side as a hobby .",
    "he proved his eponymous theorem in 1962 @xcite , and it was nt until the age of 60 that he obtained his ph.d . with his thesis ,",
    "_ sur un problme de gomtrie diophantienne linaire _ ( _ on a linear problem in diophantine geometry _ ) .",

    "though we havent defined these terms yet , what s to come should be clear : we will construct a counting function associated to an integral polytope , show that it agrees with a polynomial for positive integers ( in fact also for 0 ) , and then derive a combinatorial reciprocity theorem .",
    "while the theorems are originally due to ehrhart @xcite and macdonald @xcite , our proof is new . in particular , our proof of ehrhart  macdonald reciprocity clears up some of the mystery ( see figure  [ reciprocityfig ] ) of its statement . while the conceptual idea of the proof is simple , verifying the details involves many manipulations of summations , which can be a bit exhausting . to remedy this",
    ", we have provided general ideas of how the proofs are to work through examples before each proof .    before proceeding",
    ", we should mention that the first two examples presented in the introduction are special cases of ehrhart s theorem , because one can translate problems about counting proper colorings or order preserving maps into counting integer points in some integral polytope ( or at least something approximately equal to an integral polytope for which ehrhart s theorem is true ) . for the connection between chromatic polynomials ( and more ) and counting integer points ,",
    "the reader is encouraged to read @xcite , and for the connection with order polynomials , the article @xcite is recommended .",

    "a more careful estimate of @xmath55 in the proof of theorem  [ ehrharttheorem ] would show that for general @xmath89 , @xmath55 is asymptotic to @xmath265 , where @xmath266 denotes the * relative volume * of @xmath37 , which is the volume of @xmath37 relative to the lattice of its affine span . thus , the leading coefficient of @xmath55 is @xmath266 .",
    "the fact that the constant coefficient is 1 follows from the fact that the euler characteristic of a polytope is 1 , and that euler characteristic is additive with respect to inclusion - exclusion . to understand the second leading coefficient @xmath267 of @xmath55",
    ", we can use ehrhart  macdonald reciprocity to conclude that @xmath268 and the leading coefficient of the right - hand side is @xmath269 .",
    "this means that @xmath269 is the sum of the relative volumes of the facets of @xmath37 . with just the results in this paper ,",

    "even worse , the coefficients of ehrhart polynomials may be negative in some cases ( see example [ reeveexample ] ) , so it is not even clear what to guess the other coefficients might be telling us .",

    "* corollary 1 ) , which allows one to obtain the coefficients of the other terms via fourier analysis .      in general",
    ", it is difficult to determine the minimum period of @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , there even exist examples of nonintegral polytopes whose ehrhart quasi - polynomial has period 1 .",
    "the article @xcite constructs examples for all dimensions @xmath271 and for arbitrary denominator . for more information ,",
    "the article @xcite constructs simplices whose ehrhart quasi - polynomial has coefficient functions with prescribed minimum periods , and the article @xcite offers some conjectures for why the minimum period of @xmath55 is sometimes strictly smaller than the denominator of @xmath37 .",

    "this ratio is eventually constant for sufficiently small @xmath276 , so @xmath278 is well - defined , and we can instead ask about the solid angle enumerator @xmath279 note that the sum on the right is actually finite because for @xmath280 , @xmath281 . going through the proof of theorem  [ ehrharttheorem ] , it is immediate that it generalizes to the sequence for @xmath282 , so there is a polynomial @xmath283 that agrees with @xmath284 for all @xmath8 .",
    "we call @xmath283 the * solid angle polynomial * of @xmath37 . by the way , the right way to extend this sequence to @xmath285 can be seen from a careful analysis of figure  [ reciprocityfig ] : define @xmath286 for @xmath4 and @xmath287 .",
