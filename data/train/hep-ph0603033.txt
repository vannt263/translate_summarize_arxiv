    "future observations of supernova ( sn ) neutrinos in underground detectors represent a subject of intensive investigation in astroparticle physics . in this context",
    ", matter effects associated to neutrino flavor transitions in the sn envelope have been widely studied as a unique tool to probe , at the same time , neutrino properties and supernova astrophysics ( see , e.g.  @xcite for recent reviews ) . in particular , the effects of supernova shock waves on neutrino flavor transitions in matter @xcite are gaining increasing attention in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "indeed , for a few seconds after the sn core bounce , the strong time dependence of the shock - wave profile can leave peculiar signatures on the time structure of the neutrino events , which could be monitored in large , real - time detectors  @xcite .",
    "so far , studies of supernova neutrino flavor transitions during the shock - wave propagation have been based on `` deterministic '' matter density profiles , assumed to be known ( or at least knowable , in principle ) both in time and in radial dependence . however , stochastic density fluctuations and inhomogeneities , of various magnitudes and correlation lengths , may reasonably arise in the wake of a shock front .",
    "possible causes of these inhomogeneities include microscopic fluctuations in the nascent neutron star  @xcite and large - scale fluctuations between the proto - neutron star and the supernova envelope due to hydrodynamical instabilities  @xcite . at early times",
    "( @xmath2  s after bounce ) , post - shock convection overturns can also produce large density anisotropies .",
    "a supernova neutrino `` beam '' traveling to the earth might thus experience stochastic matter effects while traversing the stellar envelope .    concerning neutrino oscillations ,",
    "the phenomenology of possible stochastic matter density fluctuations has been investigated in several contexts , with emphasis on general properties  @xcite and on the solution to the solar neutrino problem  @xcite .",
    "supernova neutrinos have specifically been considered in relatively few cases  @xcite , and only for a _",
    "static _ profile . in general",
    ", it is found that the typical effect of random fluctuations on neutrino oscillations is to wash out the phase information ( if any ) and to damp the flavor transition pattern in the energy domain .",
    "it seems thus worthwhile to revisit this topic in the context of _ dynamic _ sn density profiles , which offer a complementary handle in the time domain .",
    "moreover , stochastic density fluctuations are expected to arise more easily in the wake of a sn shock wave than in a relatively static stellar environment .    in this work",
    "we try to explore quantitatively the entangled effects of shock waves and of possible stochastic fluctuations ( behind the shock front ) on supernova neutrino flavor transition probabilities and observables . unfortunately , current core - collapse sn simulations do not yet offer a clear input for such phenomena , both because the details of the explosion mechanism are not well understood yet , and because current computer resources do not allow to resolve density variations at scales smaller than , say , @xmath3 km .",
    "therefore , some assumptions and simplifications are unavoidable . in particular , we shall limit ourselves to small - scale and small - amplitude fluctuations , which are definitely not excluded by current simulations , and which allow a simple perturbative approach .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we introduce the notation for the neutrino mass and mixing parameters and for the electron ( anti)neutrino survival probability @xmath4 characterizing supernova neutrino transitions . in section  3",
    "we parametrize the `` fluctuating '' shock - wave profile and discuss an approximate analytic expression for the survival probability @xmath4 , which neatly includes the damping effect induced by density fluctuations .",
    "in particular , the analytical derivation of @xmath4 from the neutrino master equation for the density matrix , together with a comparison with representative numerical solutions , are given in the appendix .",
    "we find that , for @xmath1 , small - scale stochastic fluctuations can suppress the imprint of the shock wave on the flavor transition pattern in the time domain . in section  4",
    "we discuss a specific experimental application for the case of antineutrinos in inverted hierarchy , by calculating the effects of fluctuations on positron event spectra observable in water - cherenkov detectors through inverse beta decay .",
    "conclusions and prospects for further developments are given in section  5 .",
    "the bottom line of our work is that some `` smearing '' of shock - wave signatures in neutrino observables is to be expected , if stochastic matter fluctuations are present in the wake of the shock front .",
    "improvements in supernova hydrodynamical simulations will greatly help to clearify this issue .",
    "in this section we set the notation for three - neutrino mixing and for the survival probability of electron ( anti)neutrinos @xmath4 . in the current `` standard '' @xmath5 scenario ,",
    "the dominant parameters relevant to flavor transitions in supernovae are the largest squared mass difference @xmath6 and the mixing angles @xmath7 and @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in numerical examples , we take as reference values ( close to their best fits @xcite ) @xmath8 the sign of @xmath6 distinguishes the cases of normal hierarchy ( nh : @xmath9 ) and inverted hierarchy ( ih : @xmath10 ) . concerning the mixing parameter @xmath11",
