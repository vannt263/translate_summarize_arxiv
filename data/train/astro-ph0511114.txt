    "* ) may appear as knots , filaments , jets , and isolated features that , in some cases , move with the same velocity of the ambient nebula , or supersonically through the environment , like fliers ( fast , low - ionization emission regions , * ? ? ? * ) or brets ( bipolar , rotating , episodic jets ; * ? ? ?",
    "for over ten years , the strong  line emission from liss has been attributed to a significant local overabundance of nitrogen ( balick et al .",
    "1993 , 1994 , 1998 ; and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted the n - enrichment in fliers as evidence of their origins in recent high - velocity ejections of the pn central star .",
    "the above work and successively @xcite , which included the derivation of the ionic and elemental abundances of liss , pointed out  an apparent enhancement of nitrogen relative to hydrogen by factors of 2 - 5 \" in fliers .",
    "however , since then , further work casted doubts over the latter statement @xcite .",
    "abundances in pne can be derived from the analysis of collisionally excited line ( cel ) or optical recombination line ( orl ) spectra using empirical methods or tailored photoionisation models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or a combination of the two .",
    "for some elements ( e.g. he ) and ions ( e.g. n@xmath3 if only the optical spectrum is available ) the use of orl is mandatory , whilst for others the use of cels may be unavoidable .",
    "but , when both cel and orl determinations are available , the former have been commonly preferred because they are generally stronger and easier to detect than orls .",
    "moreover , there is a well known discrepancy between cel- and orl - abundances , as well as electron temperature determinations @xcite .",
    "empirical abundance analysis rely on ionization correction factors ( _ icf_s ) to account for the unseen ions ( e.g. kingsburgh & barlow , 1994 ) .",
    "results obtained with the _ icf _ method can be somewhat uncertain in some cases , particularly when they are applied to spatially resolved long - slit spectra @xcite , as has been the case for the work of @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) .    in fact , the abundances derived in  and shown here in table  1 , from optical long - slit spectra of ngc  7009 , using the _ icf _ scheme of @xcite , showed only a marginal evidence for overabundance of n / h in the outer knots of the nebula ( the ansae ) , reinforcing the doubts over previous results @xcite where the n / h enhancement of a factor of 2 - 5 in the ansae were reported .",
    "one of the major shortcomings of empirically - determined chemical abundances lies in the fact that a number of assumptions on the ionization structure of the gas need to be made in order to obtain the _ icf_s .",
    "a preferred alternative would be the construction of a tailored photoinisation model for a given object , aiming to fit the emission line spectrum and , in the case of spatially resolved objects , projected maps in a number of emission lines .",
    "ngc  7009 , the `` saturn nebula '' , is a pn comprising a bright elliptical rim .",
    "its small - scale structures include a pair of jets and two pairs of low - ionization knots . on a larger scale",
    ", it is known that ngc  7009 possess a tenuous halo with a diameter of more than 4 arcmin @xcite , whose inner regions display a system of concentric rings @xcite like those observed in ngc 6543 and other few pne @xcite .",
    "high - excitation lines dominate the inner regions along the minor axis , while emission from low - ionization species is enhanced at the extremities of the major axis .",
    "the ionization structure is further enriched by the fact that the low - excitation regions present strong variations in excitation level and clumpiness .",
    "ngc  7009 was classified as an oxygen - rich pn @xcite , with an o / c ratio exceeding 1 , and anomalous",
    "n , o , and c abundances @xcite .",
    "its central star is an h - rich o - type star , with effective temperature of 82000  k @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of ngc  7009 was studied first by @xcite and @xcite , who showed that the ansae are expanding near the plane of the sky at highly supersonic velocities .",
    "the derived inclination of the inner ( caps ) and outer ( ansae ) knots , with respect to the line of sight , are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have measured the proper motion and kinematics of the ansae in ngc  7009 , assuming that they are equal and opposite from the central star , obtaining v@xmath6 = 114 @xmath7 32 , for the distance of @xmath8 0.86 @xmath7 0.34 kpc .",
    "in this paper we will present a simple 3d photoionisation model , aiming at reproducing the observed geometry and spectroscopic `` peculiarities '' of a pn like ngc  7009 , exploring the possibility that the enhanced  emission observed in the outer knots may be due to ionization effects .",
    "we will use the 3d photoinisation code mocassin @xcite together with the long - slit data presented in  and the _ hst _ images available for this nebula . our model and",
    "the observational data are described in section  2 .",
    "the results for our main model are presented and discussed in section  3 , while in section  4 we discuss an _ alternative model _ , aimed at highlighting the relevance of the geometry and density distribution in such a kind of modelling .",
    "the work is briefly summarised in section  5 , where our final conclusions are also stated .",
    "the observations used to constrain the photoionisation model were described in detail in . these included _ hst _  and  images as well as isaac newton telescope long - slit , intermediate dispersion spectra , along the pn major axis ( p.a .",

    "we will employ the same nomenclature introduced in paper  i. see also the left panel of figure  2 , in section  3.5 .",
    "the nebula was modeled using the 3d photoinisation code , mocassin , of @xcite .",
    "the code employs a monte carlo technique to the solution of the radiative transfer of the stellar and diffuse field , allowing a completely geometry - independent treatment of the problem without the need of imposing symmetries or approximations for the transfer of the diffuse component .",
    "the reliability of the code was demonstrated via a set of benchmarks described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a number of axy - symmetric planetary nebulae have already been modeled using mocassin , examples include ngc  3918 @xcite , ngc  1501 @xcite and the h - deficient knots of abell  30 @xcite .",

    "the model input parameters that best fitted all observational constraints are summarised in table  [ tab : input ] , and discussed in more detail in the following subsections .",
    "a common problem when studying galactic pne is the large uncertainties associated with the distance estimates , that propagate to the determination of the nebula geometry and central star parameters .",
    "we adopted a distance of 0.86  kpc for our models of ngc  7009 , as computed by @xcite from the weighted average of 14 values @xcite determined with statistical methods ; the value was quoted with an error of @xmath7 0.34  kpc .      after having experimented with various stellar atmosphere models to describe the ionising continuum",
    ", we reverted to using a blackbody of  =  80,000k and @xmath15  l@xmath10  =  3.50 , as this resulted in the best fit of the nebular emission line spectrum .",
    "@xcite determined the  and @xmath15  g for the central star of ngc  7009 using non - lte model atmosphere analysis of the stellar h and he absorption line profiles , finding  = 82 000  k and @xmath15  l@xmath10 = 3.97 , in solar units .",
    "@xcite assumed a distance of 2.1  kpc in their analysis which therefore resulted in their value for the stellar luminosity being higher than that inferred from our modelling .",
    "the nebular elemental abundances used for the photoionisation model are listed in table  2 , where they are given by number with respect to h. although the mocassin code can handle chemical inhomogeneities , these were not included in our models as they proved to be not necessary to reproduce the cel spectra of the r and k regions of ngc  7009 .",
    "the values shown result from an iterative process , where the initial guesses at the elemental abundances of he , n , o , ne and s , taken from  ( see table  1 ) , and those of c and ar , from @xcite , were successively modified to fit the spectroscopic observations .      the simplest possible density distribution model was constructed in order to demonstrate that the spectroscopic peculiarities often found in liss can be the product of simple ( and well - known ) photoionisation effects .",
    "the case of ngc  7009 is taken as an example , but the emphasis is not in the construction of a detailed model for this object in particular . with this in mind we described the nebula by an ellipsoidal rim with a h number density , n@xmath16 , peaking to 9000  @xmath2 in the short axis direction exponentially decreasing to a minimum value of 4000  @xmath2 in the long axis direction .",
    "the short and long axes of the inner and outer ellipsoids measure 3.84@xmath1710@xmath18  cm and 9.99@xmath1710@xmath18  cm , and 7.06@xmath1710@xmath18  cm and 1.84@xmath1710@xmath19  cm , respectively , at the distance assumed for ngc  7009 . the rim is surrounded by a spherical shell of less opaque , homogeneous density gas , with n@xmath16  =  1600@xmath2 .",
    "the diameter of the sphere is equal to the long axis of the outer ellipsoid defining the rim .",
    "cylindrical jets , 1.75@xmath1710@xmath18  cm in diameter , connect the rim to a pair of disk - shaped knots aligned at a distance of 3.49@xmath1710@xmath19  cm from the central star , along the long axis of the ellipsoid .",
    "the cylindrical jets widen into cone - shapes at the knot ends in order to simulate the effect of material accumulating at the knots , as suggested by the @xmath20 images ( particularly for knot k4 , as seen in the right panels of figure  2 ) .",
    "the diameter of the base of the cones equals that of the disk - shaped knots .",
    "the centres of the 3.49@xmath1710@xmath18  cm diameter circular disks representing the knots are aligned with the centres of the cylindrical jets ( hence they are seen almost edge on ) .",
    "the width of the disks is assumed to be 3.88@xmath1710@xmath18  cm in our model , although only a fraction of these is ionised , as is clear from the right panels of figure  2 . the h number density in the jets and knots is taken to be homogeneous and equal to 1250  @xmath2 and 1500  @xmath2 , respectively , consistently with the values derived in .",
    "results from the ellipsoidal rim and the spherical outer shell are combined into a single _ r - component _ to enable us to carry out a direct comparison with the slit spectra from , as we show in table  1 .",
    "the jets ( _ j - component _ ) are included in our simulation as the radiation field has to be transferred through them before reaching the outer ansae ( _ k - component _ )",
    ". however , given that the emission detected from this region is very faint and that such structures may not be in equilibrium , we take our results for the _ j - component _ as very uncertain and omit them from any further discussion .",
    "finally , neither the inner caps nor the tenuous halo were included in our model .",
    "the former because they do not lie on the same axis as the _ k - component _",
    "@xcite , and are therefore not expected to have a major influence on the ionization structure of the outer knots . and the latter because it is very faint , and therefore it is not expected to contribute significantly to the integrated emission line spectrum .",

    "this is not a great concern for us , given that a detailed model specific to ngc  7009 is not being sought , our goal being the construction of a model able to explain the apparent enhancement of some low - ionisation species in liss of pne such as ngc  7009 in terms of photoionisation effects only , without the need of assuming enhancements in the total elemental abundances of those regions .",
    "for this reason , in the modelling we aimed at reproducing the spectra of the individual regions ( r and k ) with values falling between or being close to one of the observational data for north - east or the south - west regions .",
    "a good agreement is shown in the rim and shell ( namely r , as justified in section  2.3.2 ) with nearly all predicted lines falling at intermediate values between the two sides of the nebula ( upper and lower rows of the _ obs _ column ) , or being within 10 - 30% of one of the two values .",
    "the only notable exception is the @xmath284068.6 , 4076.4 auroral doublet , with both component being depleted by factors of 4 to 10 .",
    "the same behaviour is not observed in the knots .",
    "we also note that mocassin predicts slightly enhanced values for the @xmath286717,6731 nebular doublet in the _ r - component_. since the auroral lines have much higher critical densities than the nebular lines , it is possible that they are being produced in a region that is not accounted for in our model",
    ". it would be useful to check the behaviour of the @xmath07320 doublet , also auroral transitions , but unfortunately these fall outside the spectral range explored by .",
    "the agreement between model and dereddened intensities of the _ k - component _ is even better than that of the _ r - component_. all model predictions fall in between the data observed at the two sides of the nebula , or are within 10 - 30% of one of the two values .",
    "our model does not predict any he  ii@xmath04686 emission from the knots .",
    "we argue that the , however quite low , emission reported at the locations of k1 and k4 could be attributed to intervening material in the pn halo not included in our model .    in the following",
    "we will discuss in more detail the predicted mean temperatures and ionic abundances derived from our modelling .",
    "mean temperatures weighted by the ionic abundances are given in table  4 .",
    "expressions for the volume integrated fractional ionic abundances ( discussed in section  3.4 ) as well as those for the mean temperatures weighted by ionic abundances were defined in @xcite , their eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the values listed in table  4 show that the temperature structure of the nebula is well reproduced by our model .",
    "figures of  obtained for regions r , k and neb are within the empirical values determined in  ( see table  1 ) for the two sides of the nebula , namely 10,100  k , 10,000  k , and 10,100k for rim , knots and neb , respectively . similarly , the values of  of the three components agree with the empirical values to better than 5% , while for  the agreement is to within 33% and 11% for the two knots , due to our model underestimating of the  auroral lines ( see section  3.2 ) .",
    "we confirm that the electron temperature distribution is fairly homogeneous across the various regions of the nebula , see for instance , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mean  for the whole nebula , from the neutral ( i ) to the highly ionized ions ( vii ) , for all species , are respectively 10,200@xmath7200k , 10,050@xmath7150k , 10,050@xmath7850k , 11,400@xmath71050k , 12,600@xmath7700k , 13,100@xmath7200k and 12,650@xmath71,300k .",

    "an important issue that should be noted here is the n / n@xmath1 ratio being higher than the o / o@xmath1 ratio by a factor of 1.39 in the knots , 1.66 rim and 1.61 in the total nebula .",
    "this result is at variance with the n / n@xmath1=o / o@xmath1 @xcite generally assumed by the _",
    "icf _ method , with the consequent errors on empirically derived total elemental abundances , like those in .",

    "were observed ( see table  3 of ) , the nitrogen abundance determination is particularly uncertain .",
    "sulfur abundances also suffer from similar problems .    combining the values in table  5 with those for the total elemental abundances used by our model ( table  2 ) , fractional ionic abundances relative to h are readily available .",
    "the total abundance that we have used for all regions modeled returns ionic abundances , for r and k respectively , of he@xmath1  =  0.091 and 0.111 ; n@xmath1  =  1.17@xmath1710@xmath30 and 2.72@xmath1710@xmath30 ; o@xmath31  =  3.88@xmath1710@xmath32 and 3.64@xmath1710@xmath32 ; ne@xmath31  =  9.72@xmath1710@xmath33 and 9.89@xmath1710@xmath33 ; and finally s@xmath31  =  3.09@xmath1710@xmath30 and 6.79@xmath1710@xmath30 .",
    "these which are the most important ions of the optical range for determining the total abundances are comparable to the ionic abundances derived from the observations in , with an agreement better than 90% for all of the above ions , except the s@xmath31/h of r , whose discrepancy reaches 70% .    in figure  [ ionprof ]",
    "we show the ionic abundance profiles of the model , as well as the electron density and temperature profiles along the axis which includes the knots .",
    "the top - left panel in this figure , reflects the  ( continuous line ) and  ( dashed line ) variations through the long axis of the nebula .",
    "it shows that   peaks at the innermost region of the _ r - component _ , having a mean value through the component of 4,100  @xmath2 .",
    "the _ j - component _ as well as the _ k - component _ have mean  of 1385  @xmath2 and 1640  @xmath2 , respectively , while somewhat smoothed profiles are present at the edges .",
    "the electron density profile is a result of the ionization structure combined with the density distribution assumed in section  2.3.3 . as for the  profiles , although varying somewhat within the components , have mean values that are in close agreement with the values measured in , see numbers quoted in the previous subsection .",
    "this will be discussed further in section  4 .",
    "figure  1 also highlights the strong dependence of the ionisation level on the geometry and density distribution of the gas .",
    "it is therefore clear that an apparent overabundance of n@xmath1 in the knots can be produced by providing the correct gas opacity to screen this region from the direct stellar photons .",
    "we should add at this point that an even larger n@xmath1 abundance can be obtained by further enhancing the gas density at the rim - jet interface , without significantly changing the [ s  ii ] density ratio in the _ r - component_.      ngc  7009 has been observed with the _ hst _ wfpc2 with filters centred in the @xmath05007 and @xmath06583 emission lines ( see section  2.1 ) .",
    "these archive images , already published in , are compared to the model predicted emission maps in figure  [ emismap ] .",
    "the maps were produced at an inclination of 84@xmath34 with respect to the line of sight , as indicated by the kinematics of the pn polar axis @xcite , for  ( right top panel ) and  ( lower right panel ) emission lines .",
    "first of all we call the readers attention to the fact that the _ polar bubble _ , which appear in the _ hst _  image , at fainter intensity levels , as an extension of the _ shell _ , and also the inner pair of knots , _ k2 _ and _ k3 _ were not considered in our modelling .",
    "thus , excluding the polar bubble and the inner knots , the images and our maps are at least qualitatively in good agreement ( note that a photometric comparison is beyond the scope of this paper ) .    from the maps we note the higher excitation of the equatorial axis of the pn as compared to the polar one , because of the higher density of the rim , and following the pattern known from previous studies , as stated in the introduction .",
    "one also clearly sees that the  map is more extended than the  one , as expected from a nebula excited by a central star .",
    "finally , one notes that the knots are fainter ( as compared to the inner regions ) in  and brighter in , due to the enhanced recombination in the knots .",
    "all the above suggest that our model can satisfactorily reproduce the main features in the images of ngc  7009 , that could in principle be extended to other pne with a pair of outer low - ionization knots ( see , for more examples , * ? ? ?",
    "as noted in previous sections , the ionisation structure of the model is strongly dependent on the input 3d density distribution .",
    "because of that , here we also present the results obtained with a slightly different geometry , which we call the _ alternative model_. the only difference in terms of input density distribution between our initial model and the alternative one is that in the latter the jets start 3.3% further away from the central star than in the previous model . since the h number density in the jet is four times lower than the value in the rim at the position of the polar axis , our change results into an increase in the line optical depth along the path connecting the central star to the outer pair of knots .",
    "the intensity of the ionizing stellar field reaching the knots is therefore decreased in our alternative model , hence resulting in a lower ionization level .",
    "other model parameters were also adjusted in order to optimise our fit of the spectrum and these are summarised in table  6 . more importantly , with this alternative model we aimed at reproducing the more extreme   emission of the eastern knot of the nebula (  in  and in figure  2 ) .",

    "the ( n@xmath1/n)/(o@xmath1/o ) predicted by our models are 0.60 , 0.72 and 0.62 ( or alternatively , 0.61 , 0.75 and 0.64 ) for the rim , knots and the whole nebula , respectively , all at variance with the _ icf _ assumption of unity for this ratio .",
    "the _ icf_s will therefore be underestimated by the empirical scheme , both in the case of the r and k components , but more so in the former ( by a factor of 1.21 ) .",
    "therefore this effect may partly be responsible for the apparent inhomogeneous n abundance derived from observations .",
    "the differences in the ( n@xmath1/n)/(o@xmath1/o ) in these two components may be due to a number of effects , including charge exchange , as stated above , and the difference in the ionization potentials of the relevant species , which makes the ( n@xmath1/n)/(o@xmath1/o ) ratio extremely sensitive to the shape of the local radiation field .",
    "for this reason , a realistic density distribution is essential to the modelling of a non - spherical object , if useful information is to be extracted from spatially resolved observations .",
    "the density distribution of the gas modifies the shape of the local radiation field via the gas opacities and ( as demonstrated in section  3.4 and section  4 ) matching the emission line spectrum of a given nebular region relies , among other things , on the careful construction of a model capable of providing the correct optical depths in various directions .    our main conclusions discussed here",
    "may also be extended to other pne exhibiting fliers , such as ngc  6543 and ngc  6826 , for which similar apparent chemical inhomogeneities have been claimed @xcite .",

    "<S> we have constructed a 3d photoionisation model of a planetary nebula ( pn ) similar in structure to ngc  7009 with its outer pair of knots ( also known as fliers fast , low - ionization emission regions ) . the work is motivated by the fact that the strong @xmath06583 line emission from fliers in many planetary nebulae has been attributed to a significant local overabundance of nitrogen . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possibility that the apparent enhanced nitrogen abundance previously reported in the fliers may be due to ionization effects . </S>",
    "<S> the model is constrained by the results obtained by gonalves , corradi , mampaso & perinotto ( 2003 ) from the analysis of both hst  and  images , and long - slit spectra of ngc  7009 . </S>",
    "<S> our model is indeed able to reproduce the main spectroscopic and imaging characteristics of ngc  7009 s bright inner rim and its outer pairs of knots , assuming _ homogeneous elemental abundances _ throughout the nebula , for _ nitrogen _ as well as all the other elements included in the model .    </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effects of a narrow slit on our non - spherically symmetric density distribution , via the convolution of the model results with the profile of the long - slit used to obtain the spectroscopic observations that constrained our model . </S>",
    "<S> this effect significantly enhances the /  emission , more in the fliers than in the inner rim .    because of the fact that the ( n@xmath1/n)/(o@xmath1/o ) ratio predicted by our models are 0.60 for the rim and 0.72 for the knots , so clearly in disagreement with the n@xmath1/n = o@xmath1/o assumption of the ionization correction factors method ( _ icf _ ) , the _ icf_s will be underestimated by the empirical scheme , in both components , rim and knots , but more so in the knots </S>",
    "<S> this effect is partly responsible for the apparent inhomogeneous n abundance empirically derived . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in the above ratio in these two components of the nebula may be due to a number of effects including charge exchange as pointed out previously by other authors and the difference in the ionization potentials of the relevant species which makes this ratio extremely sensitive to the shape of the local radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> because of the latter , a realistic density distribution is essential to the modelling of a non - spherical object , if useful information is to be extracted from spatially resolved observations , as in the case of ngc  7009 .    </S>",
