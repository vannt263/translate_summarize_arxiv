    "deuterium , which is produced during primordial nucleosynthesis and then destroyed by astration , is a key element in cosmology . whereas measurements in low - metallicity qso absorption systems probe d / h at look - back times of @xmath6  gyrs , the present epoch deuterium abundance  can be measured in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",

    "hbrard & moos  ( @xcite ) reported a trend in the deuterium abundance based on d / o , d / n , and previously reported d / h measurements : the deuterium abundance is lower than in the local bubble for the most distant sight lines exhibiting the highest hydrogen column densities .",
    "more recent work by wood et al .",
    "( @xcite ) confirms this low value .",
    "these results suggest that the deuterium abundance might be locally abnormally higher than the present epoch value . while hbrard & moos  ( @xcite ) suggested that the present epoch ratio  would be significantly lower than @xmath8 , linsky et al .",

    "several interstellar absorption lines were detected against the stellar continuum on this 3.9  ksec snapshot observation .",
    "this indicated that the target is well - suited for distant deuterium abundance measurement .",
    "so , an additional 14  ksec observation was performed in june 2003 through the medium - resolution ( mdrs ) aperture , allowing higher signal - to - noise ratio to be reached and reducing interference from geocoronal emission from the terrestrial atmosphere .",

    "in addition , as lwrs and mdrs data are available for a given spectral feature , we can have up to eight independent spectra .",

    "several parameters are free to vary during the fitting procedure , including the column densities of all the species , the radial velocities of the six interstellar clouds assumed in the fit , their temperatures and turbulent velocities , and the shapes of the stellar continua , which are modeled by low order polynomials",

    "larger velocity corrections might occur from one segment to another .",
    "the velocity shifts are relative and we did not attempt to measure absolute ( e.g. heliocentric or lsr ) velocities .",
    "we note that the wavelength distortion problem is generally more severe in  data obtained in histogram mode . since most  observations employ the time - tag mode , distortion of the wavelength scale is usually not as bad as the examples shown in fig .",

    "the best  was obtained for a 11.4-pixel width . however",
    ", significant variations occur from one segment to the other , and as a function of the wavelength for a given segment .",
    "these averaged widths are in agreement with those reported in hbrard et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "note that during the fits , all the spectra were binned to three  pixel samples in order to reduce computing time .",
    "considering the width of the lsf , this binning does not degrade the spectral resolution .",
    "when possible , the saturated lines located on the flat part of the curve of growth were excluded from the fit . indeed , such saturated lines can introduce systematic effects on column density measurement ( hbrard et al .",
    "@xcite ; hbrard & moos  @xcite ; friedman et al .",
    "@xcite ) , mainly because the actual widths of the lines , the velocity structure of the sight line , or the  of the instrument are unknown but expected to be complex .",
    "a particular difficulty with distant lines of sight such as 9  is the rarity of unsaturated lines for some species , especially and , which is caused by high column densities .",
    "this is significantly different from local sight lines , for which numerous unsaturated lines are  available .",
    "another relevant difference between the long line of sight toward 9  and those of targets located in the local bubble is the number of detected absorption lines .",
    "the overview of the  9spectra plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_spectre_all ] can be compared with the fig .  1 in hbrard et al .  ( @xcite ) , which shows the corresponding  spectra for a target located 53  pc away .",
    "the 9  spectra are particularly crowded .",
    "this is due to stellar lines , which are more numerous here than in the case of the targets used to probe the more local interstellar medium ( mainly white dwarfs ) . in the case of 9",
    ", however , the high rotational velocity of this star smooths the stellar continuum . an even bigger effect on",
    "the absorption line number arises from interstellar lines , as the column densities here are typically tens or hundreds of times larger than those measured in the local bubble .",
    "in particular , many h@xmath15 lines are detected in the 9  spectra .",
    "this makes line blending a critical problem , which can be resolved with simultaneous fits of all the lines together .",
    "only one interstellar component , at a given radial velocity , was assumed for the sight line for a given species .",
    "this assumption is unlikely to be true but it will have no effect on the column densities measured from unsaturated lines ( see tests of this assumption in hbrard et al .",
    "thus , we report total column densities , integrated along each line of  sight .",
    "the simultaneous fit of numerous lines allows the reduction of statistical and systematic errors , especially those errors due to continua placement , lsf uncertainties , line blending , flux and wavelength calibrations , and atomic data uncertainties .",
    "the error bars were obtained using the  method presented by hbrard et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we also estimated the error bars by varying the assumptions for the fits .",
    "this included the lsf ( normally free to vary , but tests were made with fixed lsfs ) , the velocity structure ( several species are assumed to be in the same component , but fits with one component per species were performed ) and also the aperture ( comparing ( a ) mdrs and lwrs together , ( b ) only lwrs , and ( c ) only  mdrs ) .",
    "we discuss below the different species .",

    "all the rotational levels of h@xmath15 were included in a single interstellar component .",
    "the fits used a total of about @xmath19 h@xmath15 absorption lines from rotational levels @xmath20 to @xmath21 available in one to eight independent segment / aperture configurations .",
    "the @xmath22 h@xmath15 lines present damping wings and the @xmath23 that we used are unsaturated .",
    "this allows accurate column density measurements to be performed for these five levels .",
    "only saturated lines located on the flat part of the curve of growth are available for the @xmath24 h@xmath15 transitions ; this precludes accurate measurements of their column densities .    the excitation diagram corresponding to the derived h@xmath15 column densities is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_excitation ] .",
    "h@xmath15 is not thermalized for levels @xmath25 .",
    "the column densities of the levels @xmath20 and @xmath26 give the temperature @xmath27  k , which can be considered as the kinetic temperature of the h@xmath15 molecular gas . a temperature of 78  k would correspond to @xmath28  .",
    "thus , the single - component doppler parameter @xmath29  that we found for this molecular component is not purely thermal but contains additional contributions from the gas turbulent motions and/or additional velocity components .",
    "note that since the @xmath22 levels are damped and the @xmath30 to @xmath31 levels are optically thin , the doppler parameter we derived is mainly characteristic of the @xmath24 levels . on another hand , since we did not detect any significant velocity shift between the different rotational levels ( all are @xmath32  ) , this suggests that these levels arise from the same dominant cloud component(s ) on average .",
    "the only hd lines detected in the spectra are those corresponding to the level @xmath20 ; no hd lines are detected for @xmath33 .",
    "our global fits include the seven hd lines used by lacour et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and also four extra ones at 1007.28  (see fig .",
    "[ fig_fit ] , left - bottom panel ) , 925.78   , 967.53   , and 1042.84   . the other hd ( @xmath20 )",
    "lines are blended with strong lines ( as @xmath341001.89  and @xmath341078.81 , which are lost in saturated h@xmath15 lines ) and are not detected . among those eleven hd lines , the five strongest appear to be saturated or nearly so .",
    "we then performed extra fits including only the six weakest hd lines , namely @xmath341054.29 , @xmath34959.82 , @xmath34967.53 , @xmath34925.78 , @xmath341066.27 , and @xmath341105.83  ( in decreasing order of @xmath16-values ) . excluding those five saturated lines increased the hd column density estimate by 0.1  dex , from 14.42 to 14.52 .",
    "we adopt the latter value .",
    "interestingly , the radial velocity of the hd lines was found to be systematically redshifted by @xmath35  with respect to the velocity of the h@xmath15 lines . according to the error bars ,",
    "the velocity shift is significant ; it is mainly constrained by the 13 spectral windows that include close hd and h@xmath15 lines . by comparison",
    ", no velocity shifts were detected between the different rotation levels of h@xmath15 (   [ h2 ] ) , between the different atomic or ionic species (   [ ni ] ) , nor between and (   [ hi ] ) .",
    "thus , the shift between h@xmath15 and hd appears to be an actual effect , and not a systematic effect due to an instrumental artifact .",
    "in addition , we found a doppler parameter for the hd lines of @xmath36  , about half the doppler parameter estimated for h@xmath15 ( mainly constrained by @xmath24 ) .",
    "these two results therefore suggest that hd and h@xmath15 rotational lines do not trace exactly the same gas conditions .",
    "consequently , the hd and h@xmath15 lines were not assumed to be located in the same component during the fits .",
    "this might jeopardize the interpretation of the hd/2h@xmath15 ratio computed from the measured column densities of the two species . note that a similar radial velocity shift ( 4.6  ) was also detected between h@xmath15 and hd on the sight line to pg0038 + 199 ( williger et al .",
    "as numerous different h@xmath15 and hd transitions are used in these two analyses , this suggests that hd tabulated wavelengths are unlikely to be the cause of the velocity shifts .",
    "a broad study of h@xmath15 and hd radial velocities toward numerous targets is however mandatory to progress on this  issue .",
    "numerous unsaturated lines are detected in the spectra of 9 .",
    "the fits include eight of them , namely @xmath34955.26 , @xmath34959.49 , @xmath34951.29 , @xmath34955.53 , @xmath34960.20 , @xmath341159.82 , @xmath341160.94 , and @xmath34955.44  ( in decreasing order of @xmath16-values ) .",
    "some of these lines are detected in several segments and/or through the two available apertures .",
    "thus , the final fits include 18 independent unsaturated lines .",
    "these lines were fitted simultaneously with all the other ones , assuming that they are in the same cloud as , , , and . indeed , these species are supposed to co - exist in neutral regions ( and ionization potentials are respectively 7.9  ev and 10.5  ev , i.e. below the hydrogen ionization potential ) .",
    "we checked this hypothesis by performing fits with these five species in five different components , and we did not detect any significant radial velocity shifts between them .",
    "the final error bar reported in table  [ table_columns ] for @xmath14 ( ) is small due to the numerous unsaturated lines available .",
    "many lines are available in the  bandpass .",

    "the third one ( level @xmath21 ) is negligible .",

    "the question however remains open to know if this low deuterium abundance is the value representative of the present epoch , or the signature that a significant amount of deuterium has been depleted onto dust grains .",
    "finally , we have shown that d / h presents more dispersion than d / o does .",
    "as oxygen is considered to be a good proxy for hydrogen , this discrepancy is puzzling .",
    "this might call into question the homogeneity of the o / h ratio , or some or column density measurements .",
    "the complete explanation is still to be found .",
