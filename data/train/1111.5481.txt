    "<S> the most complete analysis of coupling between topology and weights is laid out in@xcite , in which the author proposed two models - a weighted attachment model with the addition of weights and a fitness based model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models can reproduce any possible value of @xmath17 , including @xmath21 , and a number of other network properties , but are sensitive to tunable model parameters , and exponents @xmath22 and @xmath16 were not reproduced .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that values of measured exponents point to the possibility that they are rational numbers . </S>",
    "<S> traditional statistical mechanics@xcite suggest that rational exponents can often be attributed to the dimensionality of space . </S>",
    "<S> if the values of measured exponents are really of geometric origin , then a fairly general model should be able to reproduce these exponents . </S>",
    "<S> such a model should produce relatively stable exponents with respect to other model parameters and possible additional refinements of the model . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple and robust mathematical model of port networks . </S>",
    "<S> this model is based on three assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> first , we assume that the probability for an individual unit to travel from one port to the other is determined by some hidden variables assigned to all ports . </S>",
    "<S> these variables depend on properties of the port such as the size of population , its economic power , number of international companies , etc . , but could also depend on the traffic network funcionality to include transient ports etc . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of the model do not depend on the precise definition of these variables or the precise mechanism of their assignement to ports . </S>",
    "<S> these hidden variables are modelled as the fitness of every port - a random number @xmath23 , which is attached to every port and is drawn from some probability distribution @xmath24@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will later show that exponents are very robust to the choice of probability distribution and to possible spatial correlations between different fitness variables . </S>",
    "<S> the second assumption is that the probability of intended travel between two ports is proportional to the product of their fitness variables @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is related to the usual model of random mixing in networks@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fitness variables represent some units which travel back and forth to interact with some other units . </S>",
    "<S> the probability that some unit from port @xmath4 will travel to interact with some unit from port @xmath5 is , in its simplest instance , proportional to the amount of units in port @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption means that the expected flux @xmath3 of units from port @xmath4 to port @xmath5 and from port @xmath5 to port @xmath4 is proportional to the product of fitness variables @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the third assumption is related to the economic and geometric properties of traffic networks . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the link between ports @xmath4 and @xmath5 will exist only if the expected volume of traffic will cover the costs of distant travel . </S>",
    "<S> the costs of travel @xmath27 from port @xmath4 to port @xmath5 are modelled as a linearly increasing function of their distance @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is related to the fact that costs of travel are , among other things , determined by the amount of fuel one has to spend travelling from one place to another and by the costs of crews which are also proportional to the distance via the number of travels a crew can manage in the unit of time . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the data on the travel fares between different u.s . </S>",
    "<S> airports and their mutual distances@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between distance and fares has pearson s correlation @xmath29 ( supplementary figure 1 ) , which justifies our assumption of linearity in the model . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this data state real commercial fares which are not equal to the lower bound of transport profitability , which is relevant for this model . nevertheless , the linear relationship between fares and distance is still clearly present . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this relationship would be even more pronounced in the data on pure costs of travel between different ports .    </S>",
    "<S> the proposed model is studied both analytically and in simulations . </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider an idealized case in which ports are randomly spread on an infinite 2-dimensional plane . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the distribution of ports is relatively homogeneous and model their spatial distribution as a spatial poisson process@xcite . to every existing port @xmath4 a random number @xmath30 drawn from some probability distribution @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> is assigned . </S>",
    "<S> then a relation between the expected degree @xmath31 of the port and its fitness variable @xmath32 can be written as @xmath33 here @xmath34 is a surface density of ports , @xmath35 is a differential element of the surface , @xmath36 is a heaviside step function , @xmath37 is function of earnings generated from the flux of travelling units , and @xmath38 is a cost function of travel which grows with distance . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that these functions are monotonously increasing . in the rest of this paper </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath39 as the simplest linear relationship . in supplementary information 1 </S>",
    "<S> we give a short analysis of some other possibilities for functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 which lead to the same exponents . in it , we also show that the relation @xmath40 needs to be satisfied on the average only to produce the same exponents as the exact version of the model .    similarly to equation ( [ eq : k ] ) the expected strength and expected distance strength of the port can be related to its fitness @xmath32 as @xmath41 the integrations in these equations are easily performed to obtain @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 represent the second and the third moment of the distribution @xmath24 . from these relations </S>",
    "<S> immediately follows that @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity we refer to these exponents as infinite exponents in the remaining text . </S>",
    "<S> one can also understand this relationship qualitatively . </S>",
    "<S> port @xmath4 will be connected with some port @xmath5 up to certain radius @xmath49 given by fitness values of these ports @xmath30 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> some port @xmath51 which has the double fitness of the port @xmath4 , @xmath52 will connect with port @xmath5 on double distance @xmath53 . since we also assume the homogeneous distribution of ports , the number of ports to which port @xmath51 is connected grows with the surface i.e. @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> weights are assumed to be proportional to the fitness @xmath32 and to the number of connections @xmath55 which yields @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the average distance of the port is also proportional to the distance and to the typical number of connections @xmath57 . having this in mind , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the relationship between the cut off distance @xmath58 and the fitness @xmath32 has to be linear in order to reproduce measured exponents .    </S>",
    "<S> although distribution @xmath24 can , in principle , be freely chosen on the infinite 2d plane , it is constrained for the applications by the observed degree distributions @xmath59 extracted from the data . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that @xmath60 is well approximated by @xmath61 and since the relationship between expected degree @xmath62 and the fitness variable @xmath23 is a monotonic function @xmath63 , then the relation @xmath64 follows . in the case of scale free distributions @xmath65 , the relation yields @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> relevant studies@xcite have found power law distributions of degrees in port networks and in validations of our model we investigate power law distributions of fitnesses for exponents @xmath67 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> another constraint on the distribution is the requirement that every port should be reachable from every other port . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , we demand the existence of a giant component in the network@xcite . yet </S>",
    "<S> another constraint is that the network should be sparse enough as the real port networks are . </S>",
    "<S> this condition can be controlled by monitoring the average degree of the network . </S>",
    "<S> all these factors have to be taken in account to choose model parameters , since not every distribution of fitnesses will satisfy all constraints for all densities or for all functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints were accounted for by considering the minimal and maximal values of fitness variables .    in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we show dependences of weighted properties on topological properties for finite 2d space depending on the exponent @xmath68 of the power law distribution @xmath24 . for a broad range of power law exponents simulated exponents </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath22 are close to theoretically predicted values , as can be seen in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the observed exponents as power law is becoming steeper which is related to the process of network sparsification , as shown in figure [ figure2 ] . in the limiting case of a network consisting of disconnected subgraphs </S>",
    "<S> it is hard to talk about exponents at all . </S>",
    "<S> the degree distribution and the aforementioned exponents are clearly not the only properties of port networks previously reported . in supplementary information 2 , for the reasons of completeness , we also present an analytical calculation for the clustering coefficient in infinite 2d plane . for thelarge </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 we observe behavior close to @xmath69 , a feature previously reported by other researchers @xcite .    in the supplementary information 3 we present an analytical treatment of the model for the finite 2d plane and for the sphere of radius @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of the sphere is particularly important since it represents the real geometry in which port networks operate . </S>",
    "<S> the expected degree @xmath31 , the strength @xmath71 and the distance strength @xmath72 of the port with fitness @xmath32 on a sphere can be computed from relations @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 the change of the geometry influences the dependences of these variable on the fitness @xmath32 , and we find deviations from the infinite exponents . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the average distances between ports reported in the previous studies , point to the fact that the majority of the traffic takes place on the locally almost flat elements of a sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the average distance @xmath76 of travels in the case of the north american airport network is around 1000 km@xcite , which means that the relative difference between @xmath77 and @xmath78 is only around @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this is the main reason why the monitored exponents of port networks really resemble theoretical values calculated for the infinite 2d plane .    in real traffic networks , </S>",
    "<S> ports are not homogeneously distributed . in the previous text we dealt with density of ports which are scattered over the space as possionian random variables@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . to check if the heterogeneities which necessarily exist among the real ports influence the behaviour of exponents , we gathered the data on geographical locations in the u.s.@xcite . in figure [ figure2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we present simulations of our model on the geographical locations of american airports .    in figure [ figure3 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we present three different sets of data points taken from the database@xcite and construct a network among them . </S>",
    "<S> the exponents do not differ much among these different spatial port distributions , as long as the distribution of the fitness variable fulfils the aforementioned constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of this model to the heterogeneity of spatial port distribution is clear . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that many ports in the world are used just as transit airports for a significant amount of traffic and the fitness variables used in the model do not capture such behaviour . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> such usage of airports also influences the realistic possible values of fitnesses and we expect that in reality they have a certain spatial hierarchical distribution .    in conclusion , in this paper we presented a very robust model which can be altered in many conceivable ways , which generally reproduce observed exponents , which relate weighted properties to topological properties . even further it can be shown that in the case of general d - dimensional flat space , the exponents would be @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( see supplementary information 4 ) , which could ( apart from intellectual curiosity ) possibly be interesting for the case of interstellar traffic with d=3 . </S>",
    "<S> similar exponents of geometric origin have been found in the case of allometric scaling in biological systems @xcite , and at present it is not clear if the presented model is related to these phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we believe that some other modes of transportation like , for instance , intercity buses , could also be well described with this model , but at present we are not aware of any additional research in that direction . since a convincing simple relationship between fitness variables proposed in this </S>",
    "<S> paper and measurable socio - economic quantities is still lacking , further research in this direction is clearly needed . </S>"
