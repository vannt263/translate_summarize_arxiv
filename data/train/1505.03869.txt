    "in addition , non - zero current quark masses in the qcd lagrangian break chiral symmetry explicitly .",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath0sb ) is manifest in the temperature dependence of the chiral ( quark ) condensate , @xmath4 .",
    "recent determinations of @xmath5 from lattice qcd with @xmath6 flavours and physical current quark masses display a chiral crossover at a transition temperature around @xmath7 mev , slightly lowered from a previous determination  @xcite , resulted from improvements in controlling the continuum limit . ]",
    "schematic models of the nambu & jona - lasino ( njl ) type  @xcite link the dynamically generated quark masses , @xmath8 , to the chiral condensate : @xmath9 this concept is adopted in the present work , as will be explained in the next section .",
    "the other important aspect of qcd at temperatures around and above the transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) is the deconfinement transition . at zero temperature quarks and gluons",
    "are confined inside hadrons . above the deconfinement temperature",
    "the quarks and gluons are released and become active degrees of freedom .",
    "an order parameter for this transition to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is the polyakov loop . in the pure gauge case ( @xmath10 )",
    "deconfinement emerges as a first - order phase transition , whereas it becomes a continuous crossover in the presence of dynamical quarks .",
    "thus , in full qcd , the polyakov loop is not an order parameter in the strict sense but it nonetheless serves as a monitor for deconfinement as a rapid crossover transition .",
    "motivated by this scenario , models have been designed ( referred to as pnjl models )  @xcite that unify the polyakov - loop - induced suppression of color non - singlet degrees of freedom below @xmath1 with the njl mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
    ".    high - energy heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) are the experimental tool for investigating properties of the qgp .",
    "electromagnetic probes such as dileptons and photons  @xcite produced in these collisions are particularly important messengers for the physics of the hot and dense qcd matter since they are barely affected by successive interactions on their way through the surrounding expanding medium . at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )",
    ", the phenix experiment has measured  @xcite a large elliptic anisotropy of the produced photons characterized by the quantity @xmath11 .",

    "by contrast , photons are generated also at early stages of the hic ( in the initial state  @xcite , or in the thermalization process  @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore not easy to explain  @xcite the large photon @xmath11 , and currently no theory has completely succeeded in doing it .",
    "recently , a new mechanism to generate a large photon @xmath11 was suggested  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the suppression of the photon production in the qgp phase due to the confinement effect .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0sb effect was not taken into account in this analysis , so if this effect further suppresses the photon production from the qgp phase , one can expect that the photon @xmath11 is more enhanced .    motivated by these issues , we calculate the production rates of dileptons and photons in the qgp phase , using a model in which the confinement and the @xmath0sb effects are both taken into account .",
