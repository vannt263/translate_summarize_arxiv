    "the main stellar evolutionary tracks for post - agb evolution are now over 20 years old .",
    "recent results show that they predict the wrong masses and ages for central stars of planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "@xcite based on a detailed analysis of 31 galactic bulge pne proposed that the post - agb evolution should be accelerated by a factor of 3 . coincidentally , during the last white dwarf workshop , @xcite presented new models for the evolution of central stars of pne obtaining similarly shorter post - agb timescales on purely theoretical grounds .",
    "here we re - analyse the data sample ( recently partially upgraded ) however this time we interpolate among the new evolutionary sequences aiming to verify their timescales .",
    "the new evolutionary models were published by @xcite . they included all the recently available improvements to the tp - agb evolution and are very adequate to the discussion of central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) . in fig.[agte ] we show the post - agb stages of evolution for six new tracks computed for solar metallicity . for comparison",
    "we show three old evolutionary sequences from @xcite  their slower evolution is apparent .",
    "the sample of 31 pne @xcite was recently partially upgraded after the careful 3d modelling published in @xcite : one object has been added and parameters of seven others were modified .",
    "the parameters derived from photoionization / kinematical reconstruction are : stellar black - body temperature and nebular kinematic age .",
    "the 32 data points are shown in fig.[agte ] .",
    "relating these points with grids of evolutionary models allows for interpolation of stellar masses ( both initial and final ) and total ages counted from the zams ; results are presented in histograms in fig.[histo ] .",
    "the 32 data points in fig.[agte ] represent the most carefully analysed milky way bulge planetary nebulae . because of the limited number of objects , the histograms shown in fig.[histo ] are composed of five bins only , equally separated between the extremes .",
    "all derived cspn masses fall within an interval of 0.05 @xmath0 which very often is a single bin for wd mass histograms , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore the comparison with wd distributions is not perfect , nevertheless all our cspn masses agree with the main peak ( @xmath1 ) of the wd masses in the well - studied samples .    the analysed pne data points cluster in fig.[agte ] near post - agb ages of 2kyr .",
    "the interpolation of @xcite between equally spaced old blcker tracks resulted in a distribution sharply peaked at 0.61@xmath0 while the accelerated blcker tracks of @xcite show the peak shifted to 0.58@xmath0 .",
    "the new tracks of @xcite reveal that the area most populated by pne is traversed by evolutionary tracks of a range of initial ( and final ) masses . in consequence",
    "the obvious peak no longer exists and the final mass histogram ( fig.[histo ] left panel ) is broadened .      to derive the initial masses we adopted the theoretical initial - final mass relation ( ifmr ) from the new tracks @xcite .",
    "this ifmr displays a pronounced plateau in the range of masses of interest here , with models of initial masses between 1.25 and 2.0@xmath0 all ending up with masses between 0.56 and 0.58@xmath0 .",
    "this feature is common to many theoretical ifmrs .",
    "about half of our sample falls between the 1.0 and 1.25@xmath0 tracks ( ages above 5gyr ) , while the other half is spread between the tracks corresponding to 1.252.0@xmath0 ( ages 51.5gyr respectively ) , gradually decreasing towards higher masses . due to the plateau in the ifmr , the concentration of cspn with masses between 0.56 and 0.58@xmath0 ( fig.[histo ] left panel ) is spread over a wide range of initial masses ( fig.[histo ] middle panel ) .",
    "one quarter of the sample has final masses @xmath2 , which corresponds to initial masses around @xmath3 and ages of @xmath4gyr  these cspn correspond to the peak at very old ages ( fig.[histo ] right panel ) .",
    "the histogram of total ages was used to derive a star - formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "the corrections for pne visibility - time and for pne birth - rate were applied exactly as in @xcite .",
    "these corrections suppress the bins at young ages while the old ages bins are enhanced .",
    "the resulting sfh is shown in fig.[sfr ] as a normalized histogram .",
    "obviously there is some uncertainty related with those corrections and their details should be improved in a future .",
    "there is in literature a general consensus that low metallicity bulge stars are older than @xmath5gyr while for super - solar metallicity there is no such consensus ; different and often contradicting arguments are neatly summarized by @xcite . with the use of chemical evolution models @xcite showed that the sfh and the age - metallicity relation obtained for the galactic inner disk @xcite provided also a best fitting color - magnitude diagram for the galactic bulge .",
    "their conclusion was that the metal - rich stars of the bulge must be significantly younger than the ( still dominating ) metal - poor population and this is an evidence for the bulge formed through the dynamical instabilities in the disk .",
    "interestingly there is a remarkable similarity between their sfh and ours , both are compared in fig.[sfr ] .",
    "the most important outcome of our work are the much lower final masses , as compared with the old models , which is a robust result .",
    "the obtained final masses are in good correspondence with the most common white dwarf masses , @xmath6 .",
    "our results agree well with the previous suggestion @xcite that the @xcite tracks were far too slow .",
    "the galactic bulge sfh , derived from the total ages , points to a burst - like old population , plus some younger objects which is in agreement with the recent galactic disk sfh and with the idea that the bulge originated from disk instabilities .",
    "these numerous accordances constitute a strong support for the short timescales of the new models of @xcite .",
    "the kinematical / photoionization reconstruction method elaborated recently by @xcite proved to be efficient .",
