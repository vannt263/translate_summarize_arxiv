    "a number of studies have been devoted to the nonlinear response in stable ( integrable ) dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "classical nonlinear response functions have been shown to diverge with time in the general case @xcite , although in certain cases the divergence can be removed by thermal averaging using the canonical distribution @xcite .",
    "the latter effect can be viewed as a result of destructive interference of different paths ( dephasing ) , while the divergence is associated with the rephasing .",
    "the divergence would pose a major problem for the whole concept of perturbative response . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum response functions do not exhibit any divergences .",

    "it has been demonstrated that systematic @xmath0 expansion cures the divergence when the limit of vanishing @xmath0 is taken after obtaining the asymptotics of long times @xcite .",
    "alternatively the divergence can be removed by adding noise that models interaction with a bath ( or a solvent ) @xcite .",
    "previous analytical studies of the nonlinear response were mostly limited to fully solvable models , which implies integrable dynamics in the classical limit .",
    "integrable dynamics corresponds to an idealized picture for a realistic physical situation , since even weak perturbations generally destroy integrability .",
    "however , the problem is that weak deviations from the integrability do not eliminate the unphysical behavior of the response functions .",
    "this follows from the fact that the divergence in integrable systems originates from quasiperiodic motions on invariant tori @xcite . according to the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory , most invariant tori",
    "are not destroyed by small perturbations that break down integrability @xcite .",
    "therefore , the long - time behavior of the response in almost integrable systems is similar to its integrable counterpart .",
    "stable dynamics is typical for a situation close to equilibrium . at larger energies",
    "a generic situation corresponds to dynamical behavior with chaotic features @xcite .",
    "moreover , unstable ( hyperbolic ) dynamics may be more common due to the stability of chaos with respect to perturbations .",
    "it has been argued based on results of numerical analysis @xcite that chaotic dynamics appears to observe the convergence of the classical response functions . in spite of apparent importance and to the best of our knowledge , the problem of the nonlinear response in strongly chaotic systems has never been addressed using analytical methods .",
    "we note that analytical calculations of the response are rarely feasible in nonintegrable systems , whereas numerical simulations of chaotic dynamics are complicated by the exponential divergence of stability matrices @xcite .",
    "a strongly chaotic ( mixing ) system is characterized by a special spectrum of the liouville operator @xcite .",
    "the spectrum consists of complex ruelle - pollicott ( rp ) resonances that determine the asymptotic oscillations and decay of the correlations .",
    "this yields the linear response function directly related to the two - point correlation functions , in agreement with the fluctuation dissipation theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "nonlinear response , however , turns out to be more involved still with the noticeable effect of the resonances .    in this work",
    "we show that ( i ) the classical linear and nonlinear response of a chaotic system exhibits decay and oscillations as a function of times between the driving pulses , and ( ii ) the fourier transform of @xmath1 second - order response function reveals broad and asymmetric peaks that can be viewed as signatures of chaos in underlying dynamics .",
    "we first establish a general qualitative picture of linear and nonlinear response in a classical system with hyperbolic chaotic dynamics and demonstrate that the classical response functions exponentially vanish at large times . to exemplify our arguments",

    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with reviewing the classical response theory using the liouville representation of classical mechanics . in section [ section : qualitative ] we present the qualitative picture for the classical nonlinear response functions and argue that they show exponential decay at long times .",
    "we also argue that a generic finite motion of the molecular system with potential interactions is similar to the free motion along an effective compact configuration space of negative curvature . in section [ section : free - partcile-2d ] we consider the chaotic model of free motion along a riemann surface of constant negative curvature .",
    "we demonstrate how to make use of strong dynamical symmetry , and reduce the model to a much simpler problem of @xmath2 dynamics on a circle . in section [ section : calculation ] we present our calculation of the linear and second - order response functions .",
    "this calculation constitutes the main technical result of the paper .",
    "the results of numerical calculations of @xmath1 spectroscopic signals are presented in section [ section : numerical ] .",
    "all necessary technical details are summarized in the appendices .",
    "in this section we review a general formalism of the classical response theory , using the language of probability distributions ( e.g. see ref . ) .",
    "we adopt the liouville picture of classical mechanics where the system state that evolves in time is described by a distribution @xmath3 , whereas the observables are represented by functions in phase space .",
    "this language is advantageous in a chaotic case , since mixing ( e.g. , hyperbolic ) dynamics is characterized by strong instability in trajectory space , and individual trajectories do not provide meaningful information on the system relaxation .",
    "consider classical hamilton dynamics that occurs in phase space @xmath4 equipped with a poisson bracket .",
    "evolution of an externally driven system is described by the classical liouville equation with a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the time independent hamiltonian of the undriven system , @xmath8 is the time dependent uniform driving field , and dipole moment ( polarization ) @xmath9 describes the coupling of the system to the driving field .",
    "this sign choice of in the poisson bracket @xmath10 corresponds to a convention that the action of the liouville operator @xmath11 determines the phase space velocity as @xmath12 .    in many cases",
    "@xmath9 is also an observable , e.g. polarization that creates spectroscopic signals , and the measured value is given by the time dependent average @xmath13 the undriven system with hamiltonian @xmath14 is characterized by equilibrium distribution @xmath15 that depends only on the conserved energy @xmath14 of the system , i.e. @xmath16 . the average of @xmath17 for the equilibrium distribution @xmath15 normally vanishes ( in spectroscopic literature this is often referred to as the absence of the permanent dipole ) : @xmath18    the response theory is usually based on a perturbative expansion of the measured signal in powers of the driving field .",
    "the response functions can be naturally obtained via calculating the correction to the equilibrium density distribution due to the driving field .",
    "the full liouville equation is repeatedly solved , this results in an expansion @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the contribution of @xmath21-th order in the field @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we start with solving the equation @xmath23 to get the linear in @xmath22 correction to the density distribution : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the liouville operator @xmath26 of the unperturbed dynamics that corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "the corrections to @xmath27 in all orders of @xmath22 can be obtained by solving equations similar to eq .",
    "( [ liouville - equation - correction ] ) .",
    "this leads to the natural representation of the observable quantity in the form of an expansion @xmath28 which defines response functions @xmath29 .",
    "the response function of order @xmath21 depends on @xmath30 time variables , it can be reduced to @xmath21 time segments @xmath31 in the case when the unperturbed dynamics has no explicit time dependence . for time",
    "segments representation , the linear and second - order response functions read : @xmath32 these expressions for the first- and second - order response will be the starting point of our general qualitative analysis of response functions in hyperbolic systems .",
    "they will be also utilized in our analytical calculations for a particular chaotic system where strong dynamical symmetry of the phase space enables us to solve the problem completely .",
    "dynamics of a classical hamiltonian system in the vicinity of an equilibrium ( stationary ) point can be adequately described by a system of uncoupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "this is achieved by expanding the classical hamiltonian @xmath14 up to second order in dynamical variables ( the first - order terms vanish for an expansion around a stationary point ) .",
    "a harmonic system represents the simplest example of integrable dynamics .    the evolution of integrable systems with @xmath21 degrees of freedom is naturally described in terms of @xmath21 canonical pairs of action and angle variables .",
    "action variables @xmath33 with @xmath34 are first integrals of motion @xmath35 in involution , i.e. @xmath36 , with the hamiltonian @xmath37 depending on the integrals of motion only .",
    "the corresponding phase space vector fields @xmath38 defined by @xmath39 , therefore , commute and describe motions along the tori with frequencies @xmath40 that depend parametrically on the integrals of motion .",
    "since for fixed values of the integrals of motion the angular velocities are constant , such dynamics is referred to as is conditionally periodic ( or quasi - periodic ) motion . for given values of action variables determined by initial conditions ,",
    "the trajectories lie on the corresponding @xmath21-dimensional torus which is a subspace of @xmath41-dimensional phase space .",
    "the motion on the torus is strictly periodic if the ratios of corresponding angular velocities are rational ( resonant torus ) ; if the angular velocities are incommensurate , the trajectories densely cover the torus ( non - resonant torus ) .",
    "harmonic dynamics represents the simplest particular case of integrable dynamics when the frequencies @xmath42 , @xmath43 are independent of the action variables @xmath33 .",
    "the nonlinear response function for classical integrable dynamics have been shown to have power - like divergence at long times which can be eliminated by invoking a quantum description @xcite .",
    "divergence of nonlinear response in integrable systems does not imply unphysical behavior by itself , since integrable dynamics is an idealization . in real systems",
    "quantum effects , interactions with the bath or irregular dynamics may provide a necessary regularization . while the first two phenomena have been discussed in the literature",
    ", we concentrate on the latter . a small , yet generic , perturbation of the system hamiltonian destroys integrability .",
    "however such a perturbation does not break down the linear divergence in the response functions .",
    "this follows from the qualitative picture of almost integrable dynamics established by the celebrated kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the kam theory states that a sufficiently small perturbation does not destroy most nonresonant tori , which means that in the invariant subspace of the entire phase space represented by the remaining distorted tori the dynamics preserves its quasiperiodic nature .",
    "although motion inside the instability zones represented by destroyed tori becomes chaotic , their relative measure in phase space is small for small perturbations to the integrable dynamics . in the simplest @xmath44 case",
    "the zones of instability are confined between remaining invariant tori .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the divergence or the classical response functions in integrable systems originates from quasiperiodic nature of the underlying motion .",
    "combined with the picture of almost integrable dynamics established by kam theory , this demonstrates the unphysical divergence of the response functions is stable with respect to at least weak deviations from integrability .",
    "we will see that chaotic regions ( instability zones ) do not contribute to the divergence , therefore the diverging terms will decrease with increasing the deviation from the integrable situation due to decrease of the amount of surviving invariant tori .",
    "integrable and almost integrable hamiltonian dynamics considered in subsection [ subsection : integrable ] is typical for low energies when the system is moving in the neighborhood of a stable stationary point ( equilibrium ) .",
    "islands of stable dynamics completely vanish for larger deviations from the integrability caused by higher characteristic energies",
    ". the motion will be typically chaotic for higher temperatures or in essentially nonequilibrium processes such as photoinduced molecular dynamics on the excited electronic adiabatic surfaces .",
    "in this subsection we present a qualitative picture of nonlinear response in chaotic systems . due to fdt , the stability matrices were found to affect the response functions starting with the second order @xcite .",
    "therefore , the divergence of the nonlinear response functions in the integrable case can be attributed to the growth with time of certain stability matrix components . in the case of strong chaos",
    "there are components of the stability matrices that grow exponentially @xmath45 with time , @xmath46 being the lyapunov exponent .",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated that at least for some examples of chaotic dynamical systems the classical nonlinear response functions are free of unphysical divergences @xcite .    in this subsection",
    "we present qualitative arguments that rationalize physical exponentially decaying at long times behavior of classical nonlinear response functions in systems that exhibit strong enough chaotic behavior .",
    "more precisely we will consider mixing systems also known as a - flows , smale or uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems ( for a nice overview without too many details see ref . ) . in these systems at all points of the @xmath47-dimensional energy shell , or all relevant points ( the relevant points belong to the so - called nonwandering subset ) in the smale s case , one can define @xmath48 unstable and @xmath49 stable tangent directions with @xmath50 , so that a small deviation from a trajectory along the stable ( unstable ) directions decays exponentially in time for forward ( backward ) dynamics .",
    "the stable ( unstable ) directions can be locally integrated to obtain stable ( unstable ) manifolds of dimension @xmath49 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "note that @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the number of positive ( negative ) lyapunov exponents .",
    "also note that in the hamiltonian dynamics case the volume in phase space is conserved so that all lyapunov exponents sum up to zero @xmath51    we will consider the simplest case of the lowest dimension coordinate space dimension @xmath44 that allows for chaotic dynamics .",
    "the isoenergetic shell is @xmath52-dimensional , we have @xmath53 , and two nontrivial lyapunov exponents @xmath54 .     is presented by two regions oppositely charged regions ( dark red and light green ) . as time elapses the distributions elongate along unstable directions and contract along stable ones .",
    "[ fettuccine ] , width=268 ]    a schematic picture of first- and second - order response formation in a hyperbolic chaotic system is shown in fig .  [ fettuccine ] .",
    "since chaotic dynamics described in terms of phase - space trajectories is extremely unstable , using the dual representation via evolution of distributions ( liouville representation ) will be advantageous .",
    "we start with the linear response function @xmath55 .",

    "this gives the volume of the single @xmath68 region in the energy shell @xmath69 .",
    "a typical distance @xmath70 between the fettuccine in the overlap regions can be easily estimated as @xmath71 .",
    "this estimates the number of disconnected regions of the overlap as @xmath72 since @xmath17 assumes opposite signs in two initial regions , the distribution @xmath64 consists of two positively and negatively `` charged '' fettuccine .",
    "the cancellations result in a signal determined by a typical fluctuation proportional to @xmath73 , and the overlap integral attains a factor @xmath74 .",
    "this results in the decaying long - time asymptotic of the linear response function @xmath75 .",

    "similar to the case of linear response for @xmath82 , the shapes of both distributions @xmath83 become similar to ribbon - like fettuccine , unchanged along the flow .",
    "since @xmath84 results from reverse dynamics , the distributions @xmath85 and @xmath84 are elongated along the unstable and stable directions of the positive time evolution , by the factors @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",

    "this is the liouville space signature of the exponentially growing components of the stability matrix , which affects the response starting with second order due to fdt @xcite .",
    "the exponentially growing components of the stability matrix may seem to be a reason for an exponential divergence of the nonlinear response , since interaction with the driving field can be considered as a kick leading to an infinitesimal deviation that grows exponentially with time .",
    "this would actually happen if the initial distribution was @xmath100-functional concentrated at some point in phase space , and the signal was measured by a deviation of the perturbed trajectory from its unperturbed counterpart .",
    "however , the dipole @xmath17 that describes the system coupling to the driving field is represented by a smooth function . as shown below due to this smoothness",
    "the exponentially diverging terms cancel out completely .",
    "this demonstrates that response in chaotic systems should be treated using the liouville ( distribution - based ) representation of classical dynamics , while its dual trajectory - based counterpart may lead to misleading naive picture .    to prove the harmlessness of the derivative in the second - order response function , we decompose the vector field @xmath101 into the direction along the energy , flow , unstable , and stable components",

    "stated differently , the exponentially growing components of the stability matrices that in principle enter the expressions for nonlinear response functions @xcite , do not affect the long - time behavior of the nonlinear response , due to the smoothness of the dipole function @xmath97 that describes the system coupling to the driving field .",
    "the qualitative arguments developed in this subsections for the lowest - dimensional case @xmath44 can be extended to a general case @xmath111 in a straightforward way .",
