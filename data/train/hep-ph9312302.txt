    "the next and the last family of @xmath11 mesons to be observed will be the @xmath0 mesons made up of one charm quark and one bottom anti - quark .",
    "the @xmath0 meson family differs from the @xmath12 and @xmath13 families and from other @xmath11 mesons because it is made up of a pair of heavy quark and anti - quark of _ different _ flavors and masses . unlike the other heavy - light mesons ,",
    "a lot of the dynamics of @xmath0 meson can be predicted reliably because it is within the perturbative qcd regime like the other heavy quarkonium systems .",
    "but it does not mean that the @xmath0 mesons are not interesting sources of new physics . instead , their productions , spectroscopy , and decays will offer great opportunities to examine various heavy quark fragmentation models , heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry , different quarkonium bound - state models , and properties of inclusive and exclusive decay channels .",
    "all the previous estimates @xcite of @xmath0 meson production were based on the perturbative calculation of @xmath14 , in which the ratio @xmath15 was extracted and identified as the fragmentation probability .",
    "it was about @xmath16 .",
    "the uncertainty comes from the choices of the quark masses and of the scale in the running strong coupling @xmath17 .",
    "there was also an estimate @xcite based on the herwig monte carlo , and the above ratio is roughly @xmath18 at various colliders .",
    "but there were no reliable estimates that can include higher order corrections .",
    "this problem becomes more serious at hadronic colliders because those terms consisting of large logarithms of @xmath19 from higher order corrections are needed to be summed in order to get reliable predictions . here",
    "@xmath5 stands for the typical energy scale in high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "recently , braaten and yuan @xcite pointed out that the heavy quarkonium production in the large transverse momentum region at hadron colliders is dominated by fragmentation .",
    "they also showed that the fragmentation function @xmath20 for a gluon to split into a @xmath12 with momentum fraction @xmath21 can be calculated within the framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "subsequently , the fragmentation functions for the following splitting processes @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 polarized @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite , and @xmath25 polarized @xmath10 @xcite were also evaluated .",
    "such developments are important because these fragmentation functions are the boundary conditions for the altarelli - parisi evolution equations at the heavy quark mass scales .",
    "large logarithms can now be summed by solving the evolution equations .",
    "the fragmentation functions are process - independent and can be applied not only to the @xmath26 colliders but also to the hadronic environments .",
    "the work @xcite by one of us on the @xmath0 meson productions at hadronic colliders was performed based on the direct @xmath24 fragmentation functions @xcite , and it was shown that a sizeable number of @xmath0 mesons should be seen at the tevatron in the very near future .",
    "it was mentioned by falk _",
    "et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite that as one evolves from the charm quark mass scale up to the collider energy scale , a gluon fragmentation function for @xmath27 can be induced by the splitting of @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) followed by @xmath30 ( or @xmath29 ) fragmenting into @xmath12 , and the induced gluon fragmentation function can easily surpass the direct gluon fragmentation .",
    "this observation prompts us to examine the @xmath0 meson productions due to the induced @xmath31 fragmentation functions .",
    "we will show despite the fact that the induced gluon fragmentation functions are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation functions , their impacts on the @xmath0 meson productions are nevertheless significant when compared to the productions by the direct @xmath32 meson fragmentation .",
    "the induced gluon contributions can account for about one - fifth of the total production cross section with @xmath33 gev at the tevatron , and therefore can not be ignored .    in the next section , we will determine the induced gluon fragmentation functions . in section iii",
    ", we will calculate the @xmath34 distributions and the total cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath10 meson productions due to the induced gluon fragmentation at the tevatron and the lhc , and compare them with the productions by the direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation .",
    "we will then conclude in section iv .",
    "simply by using power counting , the direct @xmath35 fragmentation functions are suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath17 relative to the direct @xmath24 fragmentation functions .",
    "however , in the leading logarithmic approximation , the induced gluon fragmentation functions @xmath36 are of order @xmath37 at a renormalization scale @xmath38 @xcite . at large enough scale @xmath38",
    ", the logarithmic factor @xmath39 may compensate for the extra power of @xmath17 such that the induced @xmath36 are effectively of order @xmath40 , just the same as the direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation functions @xmath41 . for this reason",
    ", we will ignore the direct @xmath31 contributions in what follows .",
    "we will also ignore the induced gluon fragmentation associated with @xmath28 followed by @xmath30 fragmenting into @xmath0 and @xmath10 since the fragmentation probabilities for @xmath42 are two orders of magnitude smaller than those for @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the altarelli - parisi evolution equations for @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given by @xmath45 @xmath46 a similar set of equations associated with the @xmath10 case can also be written down but will be omitted here . if the fragmenting gluon and @xmath2-quark have energies much greater than the heavy quark masses , the altarelli - parisi splitting functions can be taken to be those of the light quarks , i.e. , to leading order in @xmath17 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of active flavors below the scale @xmath38 .",
    "since the energy threshold of producing a @xmath0 or @xmath10 meson from a gluon is @xmath49 in the non - relativistic approximation , we assume @xmath50 the @xmath51 and @xmath52 at the initial scale @xmath53 are given by @xcite @xmath54\\ , ,   \\nonumber % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath0 state , and @xmath55 \\ , ,   \\nonumber % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath10 state .",
    "@xmath56 is the radial wave function at the origin with the radial quantum number suppressed and @xmath57 .",
    "we can now evolve the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 from @xmath60 to a higher scale by solving the evolution equations ( [ db ] )  ( [ pgg ] ) with eqns.([dg0 ] )  ( [ dz2 ] ) as the boundary conditions .",
    "despite the off - diagonal terms @xmath61 and @xmath62 are included here , the evolved @xmath43 and @xmath63 have no noticeable difference from those shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and will not be repeated . because the splitting function @xmath64 is a total plus  function ,",
    "the @xmath65 fragmentation probabilities remain the same over all scales except for a small correction from the off - diagonal terms .",
    "the fragmentation probability for @xmath32 is about @xmath66 , and that for @xmath67 is about @xmath68 at the initial scale @xmath60 = 7.9 gev ( the very large scale of 0.8 tev ) .",
    "we chose @xmath69 gev and @xmath70 gev .",
    "the induced gluon fragmentation functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 at various scales @xmath38 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dg ] .",
    "the fragmentation probabilities @xmath73 and @xmath74 at different scales @xmath38 are also listed in table  [ table1 ] . from this table",
    ", one can see that the fragmentation probabilities for @xmath75 increase rapidly as the scale @xmath38 goes up .",
    "the induced gluon fragmentation probabilities are in general only a few % to at most 10% of the direct @xmath76 fragmentation probabilities for @xmath38 ranging from a few ten gev s up to 0.8 tev .",
    "hence , for the range of scales that is relevant to the @xmath0 meson productions , the induced gluon fragmentation functions @xmath77 are not important relative to the direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation functions @xmath78 .",
    "the reason why the induced @xmath35 fragmentation is important to the @xmath0 meson productions is not because of the induced gluon fragmentation functions themselves , which we have shown to be small , but because the subprocess cross sections to produce gluon are much larger than those to produce @xmath2-quark .",
    "this is the subject that we are now turn to in the next section .",
    "the induced gluon fragmentation functions @xmath44 and @xmath79 are convoluted with the inclusive gluon production subprocesses to obtain the cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath10 meson productions , respectively .",
    "the differential cross section of the @xmath0 meson production at a transverse momentum @xmath34 is given by @xmath80 where the summation is over all possible subprocesses : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "formulas for the subprocess cross sections @xmath84 at the lowest order can be found in standard textbooks .",
    "similar equation can be written down for the case of @xmath10 and will be omitted .",
    "we use the parameterization of hmrs @xcite for the parton distribution functions @xmath85 .",
    "the running strong coupling @xmath17 is evaluated at 1-loop by evolving from the experimental value @xmath86 , and is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath48 is the number of active flavors below the scale @xmath5 .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath38 in eqn.([pt ] ) is chosen to be the transverse momentum @xmath89 of the fragmenting gluon .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions for the @xmath0 and @xmath10 mesons with @xmath90  gev and @xmath91 at the tevatron are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - pt ] for both the induced gluon fragmentation and the direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation .",
    "the corresponding curves at the lhc with @xmath92  gev and @xmath93 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lhc ] .",
    "the integrated cross sections @xmath94 and @xmath95 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - inte ] .",
    "although the induced gluon fragmentation probabilities are only a few % of the corresponding direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation probabilities , the amplitude squared of the most important subprocess @xmath81 is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of the subprocess @xmath96 .",
    "it means that the large cross section of the subprocess @xmath81 makes up the smallness of the induced gluon fragmentation functions such that the resultant @xmath0 meson production cross sections due to the induced gluon fragmentation are not insignificant . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - inte ] , the contributions from the induced @xmath97 fragmentation are almost 30% ( 50% ) of the corresponding contributions from the direct @xmath98 fragmentation with @xmath99  gev . actually , the contribution from the induced gluon fragmentation gets closer to the contribution from the direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation at higher @xmath100 because the induced @xmath101 fragmentation has a larger probability as the scale @xmath102 increases ( illustrated clearly in both table  [ table1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - dg ] ) .",
    "the situation at the lhc is roughly the same , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - lhc ] and [ fig - inte ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that we are comparing mainly the subprocess @xmath81 followed by the induced @xmath35 fragmentation and the subprocess @xmath103 followed by the direct @xmath76 fragmentation .",
    "the comparison is therefore not affected by the enormous @xmath104 luminosity at the lhc compared with the tevatron .",
    "so far we have only presented the results of the @xmath105 states .",
    "all the excited @xmath0 states will eventually decay into the ground state @xmath106 via emissions of pions and photons , and so they all contribute to the inclusive @xmath0 meson production .",
    "the contribution from the first radial excited states @xmath107 can be obtained simply by multiplying the @xmath105 results by the ratio @xmath108 . at the tevatron , for an integrated luminosity of 25  pb@xmath109",
    "there are about 16,000 @xmath0 mesons with @xmath33  gev @xcite by the direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation including all the @xmath105 and @xmath107 states ; while there should be about 4,300 @xmath0 mesons produced by the induced gluon fragmentation with the same integrated luminosity .",
    "thus we have shown that the induced gluon fragmentation increases appreciably the total @xmath0 meson production that was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation was considered .",
    "we have determined the induced gluon fragmentation functions @xmath44 and @xmath79 for gluon to fragment into the two s - wave heavy meson states , @xmath0 and @xmath10 , composed of a charm quark and a bottom anti - quark .",
    "they are only a few % of the corresponding direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation functions .",
    "but due to the large parton - level cross sections of the subprocesses , the @xmath0 and @xmath10 meson productions by the induced gluon fragmentation are found to be significant and comparable to the productions by the direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation .",
    "hence , we have shown that the induced gluon fragmentation increases appreciably the total @xmath0 meson production .",
    "for an integrated luminosity of 25 pb@xmath109 at the tevatron , there are totally about 20,000 @xmath0 mesons with @xmath33  gev from both the induced gluon and direct @xmath2-quark fragmentation , of which 4,300 come from the induced gluon contribution . taking into account of the branching ratio ( @xmath110% ) of the most spectacular signature of three charged leptons from the same secondary vertex in the decay @xmath111 , there should be a sizeable number of @xmath0 mesons that can be observed very soon at the tevatron .",
    "the smallness of the induced gluon fragmentation functions also remind us that the contribution from direct gluon fragmentation , which we have ignored in this analysis , might be important as well",
    ". it might be interesting to calculate the @xmath112 direct gluon fragmentation functions .",
    "they , of course , can only increase the production rates that we have already evaluated .",
    "extensions of the above results to the p - wave and d - wave @xmath0 mesons are also important .",
    "since the annihilation channels of these excited @xmath0 meson states are highly suppressed , once produced by fragmentation they will eventually decay into the s - wave ground state @xmath0 .",
    "hence , they all contribute to the inclusive @xmath0 meson production .",
    "fragmentation functions for @xmath25 p - wave @xmath0 mesons have now been calculated @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions like those obtained in this paper can be made for the @xmath12 ( or @xmath113 ) production at hadron colliders .",
    "the @xmath114 fragmentation induced by @xmath28 or @xmath29 followed by @xmath30 or @xmath115 ( or @xmath113 ) is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the direct @xmath30 or @xmath115 ( or @xmath113 ) fragmentation @xcite , but should be comparable to or even larger than the direct @xmath114 ( or @xmath113 ) fragmentation @xcite , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "also , the @xmath12 ( or @xmath113 ) production by the induced gluon fragmentation should be a significant fraction of the production by the direct @xmath30 ( or @xmath29 ) @xmath116 ( or @xmath113 ) fragmentation , mainly because the subprocess @xmath81 has a much larger cross section than the subprocesses @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "however , the dominant production mechanism of the p - wave charmonium states @xmath119 and @xmath120 at large transverse momentum are due to the direct gluon and direct @xmath30-quark ( or @xmath29-quark ) fragmentations , since they both are of order @xmath40 @xcite !",
    "radiative decays of these p - wave states into @xmath12 can contribute to the inclusive @xmath12 production at hadron colliders .",
    "preliminary results on direct charmonium production via fragmentation have been reported in ref.@xcite .",
