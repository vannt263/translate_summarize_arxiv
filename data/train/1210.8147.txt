    "there is increasing evidence for a class of supernovae ( sne ) which are accompanied by trans - relativistic shocks ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these are initially radiation mediated while going through optically thick gas , _",
    "i.e. , _ the stellar or a circumstellar envelope @xcite . the typical photon energy could be as high as @xmath3 kev within a few thomson mean free paths near the shock @xcite . once the optical depth becomes small enough that the photon diffusion velocity is similar to the shock velocity , photons begin to escape and are observed as the shock breakout emission .",
    "the energy spectrum is expected to be a combination of non - thermal and quasi - thermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such x - ray breakouts have now been confirmed in some cases @xcite .",
    "an interesting application of trans - relativistic shock breakouts is to low luminosity gamma - ray bursts  ( ll grbs ) associated with sne , such as grb060218/sn2006aj @xcite and grb100316d / sn2010bh @xcite .",
    "these grbs share peculiar characteristics compared to typical long grbs : smaller luminosities ( @xmath4 ) , softer peak energies ( @xmath5 ) , and longer durations ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the trans - relativistic shock breakout model can explain these characteristics @xcite .",
    "the host galaxies are both nearby ( @xmath7 for grb060218 @xcite and @xmath8 for grb100316d @xcite ) .",
    "the dimness and the proximity indicate that there might be a considerable number of sub - threshold events resulting in a relatively high local rate of some @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "hence ll grbs may be one of the promising targets for multi - messenger astronomy searches @xcite , e.g. with specially designed facilities such as amon@xcite .    in general",
    ", shocks would become collisionless beyond the breakout radii , allowing charged particles to be accelerated @xcite .",
    "the accelerated protons can produce mesons by the photomeson interaction or the inelastic @xmath10 reaction , resulting in neutrinos and gamma rays as decay products of the mesons .",
    "this situation is analogous to the photospheric scenario of grb prompt emission @xcite .    in this _ letter _ , we evaluate the high energy neutrino and gamma - ray emission from trans - relativistic shocks breaking out from the circumstellar envelope .",
    "we are primarily concerned with the application to ll grbs associated sne , but our prescriptions could be generally applied to other cases , e.g. , non - grb broad - line snic including hypernovae , by appropriately scaling the velocity and the breakout radius of the shock , depending on the density profile .",
    "our work differs from previous studies @xcite where neutrino counterparts of ll grbs were evaluated based on the _ relativistic _ jet model ( @xmath11 ) , which is also viable @xcite .",
    "although the main microphysical process , _ i.e. _ the photomeson interaction between accelerated protons and the observed x - ray photons , is the same , the predictions are not the same , due to differences in the emission radius and the lorentz factor @xcite .",
    "also , our prediction on the detectability of the gamma - ray counterpart is more positive than previous estimates .",
    "the present results also differ from those of @xcite , which considered the neutrino and gamma - ray emission from _ non - relativistic _ shocks ( @xmath12 ) colliding with the dense circumstellar material .",
    "we consider a trans - relativistic shock @xmath13 in a wind circumstellar material @xmath14 .",
    "initially , the shock is radiation - mediated , the temperature near the shock can be as high as @xmath15 , and @xmath16 pairs are relevant as an opacity source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this hot , optically thick region begins to expand until the pair loading becomes negligible , that is , the temperature is decreased to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we define the breakout radius where a bulk of the photons begin to diffuse out as @xmath18 . here",

    "not only non - thermal protons which we discuss later , but also non - thermal electrons accelerated at the collisionless shock can affect the photon spectrum by e.g. , the inverse compton process . here",

    "these soft photons can affect the opacity of high energy gamma rays , as we show below .",
    "the high energy cut - off can be set as @xmath47 since the pair absorption would be crucial above this energy .",
