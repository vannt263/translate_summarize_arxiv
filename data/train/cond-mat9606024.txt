    "after the laughlin states ( ls ) were proposed as new ground states of strongly correlated 2d - electron liquid in external magnetic field @xcite , they were intensively compared to the known ground states ( gs ) , in particular with the wigner crystal ( wc ) , to understand the conditions and limitations of the experimental observation of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) .",
    "in fact , even ls themselves may be called `` liquid '' only for sufficiently large filling factors @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 @xcite ) , as follows from the formal analogy between the ls and the two - dimensional one - component plasma at dimensionless temperature @xmath6 . at",
    "very small @xmath7 the equivalent plasma undergoes kosterlits - thouless transition to the state with the finite shear modulus and should be rather viewed as a solid @xcite .    for the coulomb system",
    ", however , the critical value , @xmath8 , is of academic importance only , since it is easy to prove that in the solid phase the lauglin state differs qualitatively from the genuine gs . indeed , in a solid with non - zero shear modulus and coulomb interaction between the particles the sound dispersion law in magnetic field is @xmath9 @xcite . calculating the mean - square displacement in such",
    "a solid at @xmath10 one finds a convergent answer @xmath11 . on another hand",
    ", the equivalence between the ls and the finite - temperature 2d plasma implies divergency of this correlator . [ in solid plasma this divergency is due to the transverse - sound dispersion law : @xmath12 .",
    "thus solid ls maintains the topological order only , which is typical for the 2d solid with short - range interactions in magnetic field when @xmath13 , in agreement with the fact that ls is a perfect trial function for gs of the system with short - range interactions .",
    "having established that in the coulomb system ls provides incorrect gs for large @xmath14 , one may further suspect that it may give the way to the wigner crystal at much smaller @xmath15 .",
    "early variational calculations performed for the electrons at the lowest landau level and neglecting landau - level - mixing effects @xcite gave strong evidence that wc has lower energy already at @xmath16 , which explained why there is no hall conductivity quantisation at this filling factor . mixing effects , which are very important in real systems , were taken into consideration in refs.@xcite .",
    "it was found that virtual transitions between the landau levels promote wc states and make ls unstable even at @xmath17 for sufficiently large mixing parameter @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the magnetic length in the external field @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath22 is the cyclotron frequency for electrons with the effective mass @xmath23 .",
    "( we use units @xmath24 ) . for the @xmath25 case the results of refs.@xcite predict ls to be the ground state for filling factors @xmath17 and @xmath26 .",
    "an essential drawback of previous calculations is their variational character .",
    "since the difference in energy ( per particle ) between the ls and wc is only a few percent in coulomb units @xmath27 , only filling factors @xmath28 with odd @xmath15 , were the liquid gs is known reasonably well , were analyzed in detail .",
    "we simply do not know other liquid states with necessary accuracy to compare them with the variational functions we have at hand for wc .",
    "moreover , it is impossible to use ls energies @xmath29 to derive @xmath30 for other filling factors by extrapolation , because of the cusps that must occur at filling factors where fqhe exists .",
    "it is believed that due to this cusping down at simple rational @xmath31 there may arise reentrant wc - ls - wc behaviour around @xmath3 ( and possibly @xmath17 ) .",
    "available experimental data seem to give strong evidence that wc exists at @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "however , this conclusion is based entirely on the divergent , activation - type resistivity @xmath33 at low temperatures , thus one may not rule out the possibility of explaining the data by impurity induced electron localisation .    the other way to study",
    "this problem is by means of exact diagonalization .",
    "we are not aware of any systematic attempt to look for the wc states in numerical simulations of fqhe , although in @xcite wc was suggested as a possibility to explain perculiar degeneracies in the numerical spectra as a function of inter - particle pseudo - potential .",
    "as we show below , the collapse of the ls to the gapless state at @xmath17 found in @xcite , has nothing to do with the transition to wc state .",
    "the best numerical calculations were done on a sphere for as many as @xmath34 particles on 25 orbits @xcite .",
    "the spherical geometry being perfect for the study of fqhe itself , is practically ineligible for looking at wigner crystallization .",
    "there is little doubt that the optimal electron configuration in the wc is the triangular lattice , which is topologically prohibited on a sphere .    to give further theoretical support to the idea that wc state may be gs of the 2d electron gas at @xmath35 , we calculated numerically gs and low - laying excited states for the cluster of 7 electrons in the lowest landau level and in the confining potential .",
    "( the number of particles in the system must be 7,12 etc .",
    ", depending on the sample geometry , to account for the hexagonal symmetry of wc ) .",
    "the confining potential was derived from the coulomb interaction between an electron in the cluster and electrons outside the `` first coordination sphere '' ( that is at a distance equal or larger then @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the atomic length in the triangular lattice ) .",
    "in fact , the radius , @xmath37 , of this confining potential was our main variable determining an effective filling factor ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "it was found that wc state ( see below the discussion of what has to be thought of as wc for the system of only 7 particles ) is gs of the system for all filling factors between @xmath39 and @xmath26 except for the region @xmath40 ( including @xmath41 ) , where ls was essentially present in the structure of gs .",
    "these results strongly suggest ( keeping reservations for possible finite - size corrections ) that ls at @xmath17 is very close in energy to wc , and that in a perfect coulomb system at @xmath3 the ground state may be wc .",
    "there is almost no doubt then that wc must exist between these two filling factors .",
    "our calculation completely ignores impurities and landau - level - mixing effects , as well as possible screening of the bare coulomb potential , and the role of electron delocalisation in the direction perpendicular to the 2d plane .",
    "some of these factors are very important in real systems , and , e.g. , electron screening , may work in favour of ls .",
    "we believe that experimental data of refs .",
    "@xcite , demonstrating fqhe at @xmath3 , can be accounted for along these lines .",
    "we are planning to study different pseudo - potentials in a separate paper .",
    "we study a 2d system of @xmath42 electrons in the magnetic field in a confining potential .",
    "since we intend to model the macroscopic system in the finite - cluster calculation , we derive this confining potential as resulting from the coulomb interaction between an electron in the cluster and other electrons outside the `` first coordination sphere '' . the unit length @xmath43 in the wc lattice",
    "is expressed through the electron density @xmath44 and filling factor @xmath45 as @xmath46 ( from now on we measure all distances in units of @xmath47 , which is kept fixed in our calculation ) . to account for the short - range correlations we place surrounding electrons on the coordination spheres of the wc state .",
    "one may better view our system as originating from the classical crystal with atoms sitting on the @xmath48 orbits @xmath49 , with the positions @xmath50 forming an ideal triangular lattice corresponding to the filling factor @xmath31 .",
    "we then allow for full quantum dynamics of 7 electrons with @xmath51 and @xmath52 while keeping other electrons frozen , but coupled to the first 7 ones by coulomb forces .",
    "thus obtained confining potential is not spherically symmetric , and may cause transitions changing the momentum of an inner electron by @xmath53 . obviously , this coupling will promote `` crystal '' state for the central cluster . to avoid this shortcoming",
    "we ignore all these transitions , keeping only the diagonal part of the interaction ; this procedure is equivalent to rotational averaging of the confining potential .",
    "we also ignore landau level mixing , which means that coulomb interaction is the only energy scale in the problem . to simplify the notation we measure all energies in units @xmath54 .",
    "working in the symmetric gauge @xmath55 we place the electrons on up to 31 orbits corresponding to the angular momentum states ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath56 .",
    "the maximum number of orbits in a given calculation was defined by the condition that occupation numbers @xmath57 , giving the probability to find an electron in the state with the orbital momentum @xmath15 , stop changing ( at the level of 0.001 ) , when the number of orbits is increased , and that the lagest momentum state be empty with the same accuracy .",
    "the starting hamiltonian then can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 creates an electron in the state @xmath60 in the symmetric gauge the interaction matrix elements in the first term in ( [ 2 ] ) satisfy the conservation law @xmath61 and may be written as @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 gives the fourier component of the pair potential . for the case of coulomb interaction @xmath67 , and the final expression simplifies to @xmath68 ! ! \\",

    "\\label{6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to construct the confining potential one has to calculate the diagonal matrix elements for one electron staying on orbit @xmath69 and the other electron staying on orbit @xmath70 ( for the diagonal matrix element it does not matter whether the state @xmath70 is defined in the same gauge as states @xmath69 or obtained by gauge transforming the state @xmath71 ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath72 where the sum is over all coordination spheres starting from the second one , and @xmath73 ^ 2 } \\int_0^{\\infty } dq { v_c(q)\\over 2\\pi } \\ : q^{2m-2k+1}e^{-q^2}j_0(q \\mid z_j \\mid ) \\;. \\label{8}\\ ] ] here @xmath74 is the bessel function . in practice",
    "we constructed the confining potential by summing over all coordination spheres inside the radius @xmath75 .",
    "our diagonalization procedure is arranged as follows . for the calculation of the groundstate level we use",
    "the standard modified lanczos method with the straightforward iteration procedure ( see , for example , @xcite ) , while for the calculation of the lowest excited levels we apply more sophisticated method @xcite .",
    "the set of approximate eigenfunctions is reconstructed from relay s tridiagonal matrix @xcite , and the trial wavefunction is expanded in it . as is known ,",
    "the set inevitably involves a substantial number of spurious states , due to numerical errors .",
    "these states , however , may be easily identified by their negligible contribution to the expansion of the trial wavefunction . upon exclusion of the spurious states",
    "the set is subjected to the orthogonalization and correction by newton method .",
    "the relative ( with respect to a characteristic interlevel spacing ) errors in the energy level calculation are typically of order @xmath76 for the groundstate , and of order @xmath77 for some ten first excited states .",
    "since the hamiltonian conserves the total angular momentum we take advantage of this symmetry to proceed separately for each angular momentum sector .",
    "before presenting our numerical results for the ground and first exited states in the cluster , let us first discuss how one may discriminate between the liquid and solid states in such a small system .",
    "the most obvious solution is to look at the pair correlation function . from the symmerty considerations we expect ( at least for small filling factors ) that one particle will be always staying near the origin , and the rest",
    "6 particles will have their density distribution being peaked at a distance @xmath78 apart .",
    "these particles are mutually correlated over the angle @xmath79 between their coordinates on the `` first coordination sphere '' .",
    "the appropriate pair correlation fuction thus can be defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 varies in the interval @xmath82 . in the solid state",
    "we expect three well - defined oscillations in @xmath83 , while in the liquid these oscillations should be strongly damped .",
    "it is difficult to predict apriori the amplitudes of oscillations , but it is known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that pair correlations in the ls disappear very rapidly at @xmath17 and @xmath3 .",
    "our definition of @xmath84 is not quite standard , but we believe that its qualitative behaviour is the same ( we verify this point explicitly below ) . anyway , the abrupt change of the ground state correlator @xmath85 as a function of @xmath0 is indicative of the solid - liquid transition",
    ".    one may also expect some qualitative differences in the structure of the low - energy spectra of wc and ls . by construction ,",
    "our hamiltonian is cylindrically symmetric and conserves the total angular momentum @xmath86 . in the solid phase of the macroscopic system this symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken .",
    "for the triangular lattice under study the symmetry is broken by coupling momenta @xmath87 ( where @xmath88 is the ground state angular momentum and @xmath89 is an integer ) .",
    "thus in the solid phase we expect the states @xmath90 to form a subset of the lowest excited states well separated from the rest of the excitation spectrum in these sectors .",
    "there is no special reason to have the lowest excitations at @xmath87 in a liquid phase , nor should they have much lower energies than excited states with @xmath91 .",
    "one remark is in order here . in a really macroscopic solid ,",
    "the lowest states are those corresponding to the system rotation as a whole , with the energy going as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the system s size .",
    "the crystal symmetry is not present in the structure of the spectrum explicitly , but it is important that the states , mixed by the symmetry breaking fields , are among the lowest ones . in the finite system of only seven particles",
    "we do not expect the spectrum to be quadratic in @xmath94 , since this property in the rotating solid is achieved by creating extra zeros in the wave - function @xmath95 for fixed @xmath96 .",
    "this procedure may be too costy in energy in a small system . for @xmath97 rotation",
    "is equivalent to the correlated motion of six particles .",
    "the first rotating state which requires no extra zeros in @xmath98 is that with @xmath99 .",
    "the other point concerns the consistency of our procedure of controlling the filling factor according to equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "since the confining potential is derived from the crystal state , a natural question arises of how good is this approximation for modelling a liquid environment .",
    "there is no doubt that at @xmath17 the ground state is well described by ls with the ground - state angular momentum @xmath100 .",
    "no matter how trivial , this fact is not at all predetermined by the numerical procedure used .",
    "its validity was confirmed in our calculations , thus demonstrating consistency between eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and the effective filling factor . similarly , we observed that @xmath101 when @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the consistency of our `` mean - field '' procedure follows also from the fact that for all @xmath103 the position of the maximum in the particle density @xmath104 coinsides with @xmath43 .    in table i we present our data for the ground state angular momentum as a function of filling factor . for @xmath105 the system is described by the iqhe state with occupation numbers @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "after drastic transformations in the range of densities between @xmath108 and @xmath109 gs evolvs into the state with well - defined pair correlation function @xmath110 .",
    "we note , that starting from rather high filling factor @xmath111 the angular momentum of the ground state changes by @xmath112 .",
    "also , the lowest exited state is always in the sector @xmath113 .    to identify the nature of gs we present in fig.1 the plots of @xmath110 calculated for critical filling factors @xmath114 where @xmath88 jumps .",
    "while going from @xmath115 to @xmath116 the pair correlation function develops more pronounced oscillations .",
    "we naturally consider this evolution as formation of more rigid solid state order in the system , although the filling factor seems to be too large here to expect wc state in a macroscopic system .",
    "if we ignore for the moment what is happening in @xmath117 then the `` crystal set '' may be smoothly continued to higher momentum states @xmath118 resulting finally in a quite impressive `` long - range '' order ( see fig.2 ) . with all the reservations concerning small system size we have to conclude that wc has lower energy than ls in the range of filling factors between @xmath119 and @xmath26 .",
    "we also observe a well - defined structure of `` satellite states '' @xmath90 in the energy spectrum for small @xmath0 , for example , when @xmath120 we find that @xmath121 and @xmath122 are some five times smaller than the energy of the first excited state in sectors @xmath123 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "note also the remarkable similarity between the low - energy specra in the basic set of states with @xmath124 .    clearly , the state with @xmath117 is special in that its pair correlation function is more `` liquid - like '' than @xmath110 for both @xmath125 and @xmath126 . as mentioned above ls at @xmath17 has @xmath127 , thus irregular behaviour of the pair correlation function in this sector may be due to the change of gs from solid to liquid .",
    "this suggestion seems to be correct , because the calculated projection of the exact gs for @xmath128 , i.e. , in the middle of the stability interval of the sector @xmath127 ( see table i ) , on the laughlin state is as large as @xmath129 , and the ground state energy is extremely well approximated by the variational value @xmath130 . in coulomb units we find @xmath131 , while the energy of the first excited state in the sector @xmath117 is almost five times higher , @xmath132 .",
    "furthermore , there is no pronounced satellite structure in the low - energy spectrum when @xmath117 .",
    "surprisingly enough , the ground state wave function and @xmath133 are rather different from @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig.4 that @xmath135 is almost flat for large @xmath79 and shows no sign of pair correlations across the diameter of our system .",
    "these correlations are present in gs . also ,",
    "in fig.5 we plot the average occupation numbers @xmath57 , calculated in gs and in ls .",
    "we see that @xmath57 in ls has much smaller amplitude at @xmath48 and more shallow minimum .",
    "as one might expect beforhead , the central particle is not at all localized in the liquid phase .    to clarify the nature of such differences ,",
    "we construct another variational state , which may be regarded as solid , @xmath136 .",
    "consider two nearest solid states , e.g. , @xmath137 and @xmath138 at some @xmath139 .",
    "we notice that their distribution functions @xmath57 are very close in shape ( see fig.6 ) , with one particle being localised on orbits with small @xmath15 ( actually @xmath140 ; the sum of @xmath57 before the minimum is almost @xmath141 ) , and the other six particles occupying extended states with large @xmath15 .",
    "when going from @xmath142 to @xmath143 the value of @xmath144 changes by @xmath112 almost entirely due to the change of the occupation numbers of six particles on the first coordination sphere , i.e. , @xmath145 for large @xmath15 . considering @xmath138 as rotating state with all the pair correlations being preserved , we may construct the variational state @xmath146 close to exact @xmath147 according to the rule @xmath148 where @xmath149 , and @xmath150 are the corresponding exact amplitudes of the expansion @xmath151 .",
    "notice that the first particle keeps its states .",
    "this procedure is well justified because the first particle is separated from the others by a deep minimum in the distribution function ( with @xmath57 close to zero in minimum , see fig.6 ) . to estimate the accuracy of this procedure we project thus obtained variational state on exact @xmath147 and find the overlap to be @xmath152 .",
    "we apply now this method to construct @xmath136 from @xmath153 obtained at @xmath128 , to obtain a solid - state trial wave - function . in fig.4 and fig.5",
    "we show the pair correlation function and @xmath57 of this state .",
    "finally , the solid - state variational energy turns out to be as good as @xmath154 and the overlap with gs is @xmath155 ( even better than that of the laughlin state ! ) .    from these data we have to conclude that the genuine gs in the range of filling factors @xmath156 is a mixture of solid and liquid phases with comparable amplitudes .",
    "not only these two quite different states strongly overlap with the ground state and almost minimize the energy , but also @xmath157 .",
    "that large overlap is , of course , the finite - size effect . obviously , under these conditions",
    "no definite conclusion about the true gs of the macroscopic system is possible , and there is no contradiction with the experimental fact that at @xmath17 the gs is the laughlin liquid .    we would like to comment here on the widly used argument , based on diagonalization of _ finite - size _",
    "systems , that large overlap of ls with the exact gs and its precise energy , may serve as a criterion that the corresponding macroscopic system will be an incompressible liquid .",
    "we have demonstrated above that this argument simply does not work for the system of seven particles ; short - range order in ls and wc turns out to be very similar .",
    "one has to analyze more delicate properties ( like pair correlation function at large distances ) to discriminate between the two phases .",
    "it follows from our data in fig.2 that gs in the sector @xmath158 is of solid type . to see how different is @xmath159 from @xmath160 we present in fig.7 the corresponding correlation functions .",
    "we further confirm this result by calculating the overlap between the two states , @xmath161 , and the laughlin state energy @xmath162 ( compare with the energy of the first excited state @xmath163 ) . now",
    ", the admixture of the ls in the structure of gs is much smaller than that at @xmath17 and the variational energy is of the order of the first excited state in this sector . to reconcile this result with the experimental observation of the fqhe at @xmath3 in some ( not all ! )",
    "systems @xcite , we notice that our result was obtained on finite - size system and for the unscreened coulomb interaction between the particles .",
    "given rather large difference in energy between ls and wc found in our study , it is likely that wc will be the true gs of a macroscopic system too .",
    "this conclusion , however , may change for the screened coulomb interaction since the laughlin state is stabilized by short - range interactions .",
    "we plan to investigate the role of screening effects on the ground state at @xmath3 in a separate paper .",
    "since the liquid energy is casping down at @xmath3 , our results give very strong support to the idea that wc exists in the coulomb system for @xmath164 .",
    "even if wc is replaced with ls at @xmath3 when the interaction potential is screened , it will most likely survive at slightly larger filling factors .",
    "we thus conclude that experiments @xcite did see wc state around @xmath3 .",
    "it was found in ref.@xcite that varying pair potential between the particles in the lowest landau level one can drastically change the nature of the ground state . in this section",
    "we discuss whether this change is of any relevance to wigner crystallization .",
    "following ref.@xcite we characterize the potential by the energies , @xmath165 , of pairs of particles with relative angular momentum @xmath15 . in the lowest landau level @xmath166 where @xmath167 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "these are pseudopotential parameters because different bare interactions may have the same values of @xmath165 . for the coulomb interaction these parameters are @xmath168 and decrease slowly with @xmath15 .",
    "spinless fermions are coupled with odd values of @xmath15 only .",
    "the effect of decreasing @xmath169 for the coulomb system of @xmath170 electrons on a sphere at @xmath171 was the collapse of the laughlin - type ground state to some gapless state @xcite ( we will call it @xmath169-state ) .",
    "the nature of this state was not clearly identified , although the results did suggest a tendency to charge density wave formation . as we demonstrate below",
    ", the gapless ground state obtained by reducing the short - range part of the coulomb interaction _ is not _ the conventional wigner crystal ( by `` conventional '' we mean the single - atom triangular lattice ) .",
    "we start by noting that the new state has almost zero overlap with ls @xcite .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast with the large overlap between wc and ls found in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "this fact alone is sufficient to rule out wc as a candidate for the @xmath169-state .",
    "furthermore , as is seen from the data presented in ref.@xcite , the collapse of ls _ is not _ accompanied by formation of the low - energy satellite states corresponding to the rotations of the octahedron formed by six particles on a sphere .",
    "we performed an analogous study of the ground state changes as a function of the @xmath169 pseudopotential parameter for our system of seven particles . in agreement with ref.@xcite",
    "we observe a drastic transformation of the ground state at @xmath172 when @xmath169 is reduced to @xmath173 . for smaller values of @xmath169 the ground state",
    "angular momentum changes from @xmath117 to @xmath174 .",
    "the change of @xmath88 by 7 , not by 6 , also proves that we are not dealing with the conventional wc .",
    "finally , we followed the transformation of the solid ground state with @xmath142 at @xmath175 and observed its collapse to the same @xmath169-state for @xmath176 .",
    "these results leave no doubt that reducing the short - range part of the coulomb potential promotes new ground state other than ls or wc .    to have a better filling about real - space interaction potentials with reduced values of @xmath169 we show in fig.8 the particular set of interaction potentials of the form @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the bessel function .",
    "the first term gives the coulomb interaction between the two unit charges at a distance @xmath179 apart , each being spread out with the gaussian distribution @xmath180 , and the second term further suppresses the short - range part of the first .",
    "the choice of @xmath181 in this form is kind of arbitrary .",
    "it is justified by the simplicity of its fourier transform @xmath182 . in a more general case one may also vary the `` cutoff length '' by letting @xmath183 in the second term . in fig.8",
    "we plot the potential ( [ 12 ] ) for @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath165 are given in table ii .",
    "we see that @xmath169-state is stabilized at the edge of digging a potential well at short distances . in fig.9",
    "we present @xmath57 distribution in the @xmath169-state with momentum @xmath174 .",
    "quite unexpectedly in the @xmath169-state , the central particle is replaced with the correlated hole .",
    "one has to appreciate this result in the system with the long - ranged coulomb potential - by taking the central particle from orbits with @xmath140 and placing it to much higher orbits we substantially increase its mean - field energy . on another hand the `` first coordination sphere '' of six particles",
    "moves to internal orbits thus gaining some mean - field energy .",
    "thus we see , that @xmath169-state suggests locally ( on the scale of @xmath37 ) inhomogeneous particle distribution .",
    "of course , the long - range tail of the coulomb potential ensures that the macroscopic system is homogeneous on a large scale @xmath187 , but when the short - range part of the interaction is reduced , the system may choose states with local density higher than average .",
    "we are not able to say anything definite about such a state except that it is not conventional wc .",
    "obviously , if the final state is a solid with more than one particle in the unit cell , it can not be traced from the numeric study of seven particles .",
    "we are grateful to a.i .",

    "in these refs .  a metal - insulator transition is found to occur at the universal filling factor @xmath188 in rather wide range of magnetic fields and sample mobilities , no reentrant behavior is observed around @xmath189 .",

    "<S> by means of exact diagonalization we study the low - energy states of seven electrons in the lowest landau level which are confined by a cylindric external potential modelling the rest of a macroscopic system and thus controlling the filling factor @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> wigner crystal is found to be the ground state for filling factors between @xmath1 and @xmath2 provided electrons interact via the bare coulomb potential . </S>",
    "<S> even at @xmath3 the solid state has lower energy than the laughlin s one , although the two energies are rather close . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the role of pseudopotential parameters in the lowest landau level and demonstrate that the earlier reported gapless state , appearing when the short - range part of the interaction is suppressed , has nothing in common with the wigner crystalization in pure coulomb case .    </S>",
