    "during the past century , ever deeper observations have been mapping out the structure and history of the universe , all the way back to the emission of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) at the time of last scattering ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is an important gap in the observations , between the emission of the cmb at @xmath4 and redshifts @xmath5 . during this largely uncharted time period ,",
    "the universe was transformed from a featureless expanse of neutral gas into stars and galaxies surrounded by an ionized plasma .",
    "observing this time period , known as the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , is one of the current frontiers in observational cosmology .",
    "indirect constraints can be obtained from observables such as quasar spectra @xcite , the cmb polarisation @xcite and temperature measurements @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", space - based galaxy surveys are pushing the redshift limits ever higher ( e.g.  @xcite ) . still , however , the details about the timing of the eor and the sources that drove it are largely unknown .",
    "one of the most promising prospects for studying the process of reionization in detail is observations of the highly redshifted 21-cm emission originating from the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) as it is being ionized by the first sources of light .",
    "a number of radio interferometers  including lofar @xcite , paper @xcite , 21cma @xcite , gmrt @xcite and mwa @xcite  are just beginning observations hopefully leading up to the detection of the redshifted 21-cm radiation from the eor in the near future . in this paper",
    ", we focus on lofar , which is a multi - purpose radio interferometer operated by a dutch - led european collaboration , with one of its key science projects being the eor . in late 2012 , the lofar eor project started observations of several fields , with the hope of making the first - ever detection of the 21-cm signal from the eor within the near future @xcite .    it has been shown that after long observation times , instruments such as lofar and mwa may be able to reach noise levels low enough to directly image the largest structures during the eor @xcite",
    ". however , for this first generation of telescopes , most focus will be on statistics of the 21-cm signal  most notably the power spectrum , which contains a wealth of information about the physics of reionization ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    since the observable is an emission line , it is possible to translate observations at a specific frequency to a redshift , which in turn can be mapped to a position along the line - of - sight to produce three - dimensional data .",
    "however , the signal will be distorted by the peculiar velocities of the gas .",
    "since matter tends to move toward higher - density regions , peculiar velocities introduce non - random distortions to the 21-cm signal , changing the amplitude of the power spectrum and making it anisotropic @xcite . as was shown by @xcite",
    ", redshift space distortions can change the spherically - averaged 21-cm power spectrum by up to a factor of around 5 at large spatial scales , meaning that fitting models to data without taking this effect into account could result in significant systematic errors .",
    "it is thus important to understand quantitatively how strong these effects are at different scales and at different stages of reionization .",
    "since redshift space distortions only affect the signal along the line - of - sight , they introduce anisotropies in the otherwise isotropic signal .",
    "if the signal - to - noise is sufficient , these anisotropies can be used to remove the complicated astrophysical contribution to the power spectrum and extract pure cosmological information from 21-cm observations @xcite . in situations where the noise level is too high for this to be feasible ,",
    "it may still be possible to extract the astrophysical information contained in the anisotropies , which is interesting in its own right .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we briefly summarise the theory behind redshift space distortions and the effects of gas peculiar velocities on the 21-cm power spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] we describe our simulations of the 21-cm signal in real- and redshift - space , the instrument noise and the foregrounds . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we show the results from the simulations , demonstrating both the effects of redshift space distortions on the actual 21-cm signal at different scales and global ionization fractions , and the extent to which these effects will be visible in lofar observations .",
    "we start with a simplified scenario including only instrument noise , and then simulate a more realistic scenario taking into account a larger number of complicating effects such as foreground subtraction .",
    "we also discuss how the evolution of the power spectrum anisotropy can be used to constrain the reionization history . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarise and discuss our results .    for the simulations , we have assumed a flat @xmath6cdm model with @xmath7 , consistent with the 9 year wmap results @xcite .",
    "in this section , we go through some of the basic theory of the 21-cm signal that lofar will observe .",
    "we describe the concept of redshift space , and show how the 21-cm signal differs between real space and redshift space .",
    "we also discuss the 21-cm power spectrum , and show how this will be affected by redshift space distortions .",
    "instruments such as lofar will attempt to observe the 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization .",
    "21-cm photons are emitted when the electrons of hydrogen atoms undergo a spin - flip , and the intensity of the radiation depends on the density of neutral hydrogen atoms and the ratio between the two spin populations .",
    "this ratio is expressed through the spin temperature @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number densities of atoms in the low and high energy spin states , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the statistical weights and @xmath14 k is the temperature corresponding to the rest - frame frequency of the transition .    the 21-cm radiation will be observed against the background provided by the cmb . depending on the temperature of the cmb and the spin temperature , the 21-cm line can be visible either in emission or in absorption .",
    "the actual observable quantity is the _ differential brightness temperature _ , @xmath15 . in its most general form ,",
    "@xmath15 depends on the ratio between the spin temperature and the cmb temperature as well as the velocity gradient along the line - of - sight . here",
    ", we will make two simplifying assumptions : that the line is optically thin ( which simplifies the dependency on the velocity gradient , since we can ignore radiative transfer effects ) , and that @xmath16 .",
    "the first of these assumptions is likely to be true in all but the very earliest stages of reionization , and smallest spatial scales @xcite .",
    "the assumption of high @xmath17 is somewhat more uncertain in the early stages of reionization ( e.g.  @xcite ) . while full modelling of the @xmath17 fluctuations is beyond the scope of this work , we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] how our results might change at the highest redshifts if this assumption is not true .    with these approximations ,",
    "we may write the brightness temperature at a position @xmath18 and redshift @xmath19 simply as : @xmath20 ,      \\label{eq : brightnesstemp_short}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the fractional over - density of neutral hydrogen and @xmath22 is the mean brightness temperature at redshift @xmath19 . for an in - depth review of 21-cm physics ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect of 21-cm observations is that they are effectively three - dimensional .",
    "since the observable is a single emission line , observations tuned to a specific frequency will observe only radiation originating from a specific cosmological redshift ( assuming the redshift comes from the expansion of the universe alone ) . mapping the redshift to a position along",
    "the line - of - sight makes it possible to reconstruct the h@xmath23idistribution in 3d , either to make tomographic images ( if the signal - to - noise is high ) , or to measure statistics such as the power spectrum .",
    "however , the mapping from redshift to line - of - sight position is made imperfect by a number of factors  most importantly the fact that the redshift of an emitter is not only caused by the expansion of the universe , but also by the emitter s peculiar velocity .",
    "we will use the term _ redshift space _ to denote the space that would be reconstructed by an observer assuming that redshifts are caused purely by hubble expansion . without a way of determining peculiar velocities independently",
    ", the redshift space is the only space that is observable .",
    "a redshift @xmath19 is translated to a comoving redshift space position @xmath24 through the following mapping : @xmath25    if the redshift @xmath19 is caused only by the hubble expansion , then the redshift space position @xmath24 of some emitter will be the same as its comoving real space position @xmath18 .",
    "however , if there is also a peculiar velocity @xmath26 along the line - of - sight , then an emitter at position @xmath18 in real space will be shifted to a position @xmath24 in redshift space : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the observed redshift , and @xmath30 is the cosmological redshift @xcite . in other words ,",
    "an emitter with a peculiar velocity away from the observer ( i.e.  @xmath31 ) will be more redshifted than one with no velocity , and will thus appear to be farther away than is really the case , and vice versa .",
    "the motions of gas parcels are not completely random : on average , matter tends to flow towards high - density regions and away from low - density voids .",
    "this means that emitters on the far side of a high - density region will tend to appear blue - shifted , and thus closer than they really are , while emitters on the near side will appear farther away .",
    "the net effect is that , on the large scales that we are interested in here , dense regions will appear compressed along the line - of - sight , while low - density regions will look emptier than they really are .",
    "this effect  illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaiser]is called the _ kaiser effect _ @xcite .",
    "it is most familiar from galaxy surveys , but has recently been observed also for intergalactic gas @xcite . while there are other effects that distort positions in redshift space dependence to the power spectrum ( the alcock - paczynski effect ; @xcite ) . for this study",
    ", we assume that the relevant cosmological parameters are known .",
    "] , from now on , for simplicity , we will use the term _ redshift space distortions _ to mean the shifts in apparent position caused by gas peculiar velocities . with the assumptions we are making here ( optically thin line , @xmath32 ) , 21-cm redshift space distortions are completely analogous to redshift space distortions in galaxy surveys .",
    "one of the most interesting statistical quantities for lofar  and the one we are concerned with in this paper  is the power spectrum of the 21-cm differential brightness temperature fluctuations , or _ 21-cm power spectrum _ for short .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath33 is defined as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fourier transform of @xmath15 and @xmath36 is the three - dimensional dirac delta function .",
    "it is often useful to work with the dimensionless power spectrum , defined as @xmath37 which for the case of the 21-cm power spectrum is in fact not dimensionless , but has the units of mk@xmath38 .    in real space",
    ", the cosmological 21-cm signal is isotropic , meaning that @xmath39 is expected to have the same value for all @xmath40 with a fixed magnitude @xmath41 .",
    "however , in redshift space , this is no longer true ",
    "the 21-cm power spectrum will now depend on the direction of @xmath40 .",
    "it is convenient to work with the parameter @xmath42 , which is the cosine of the angle between the direction in @xmath41 space and the line - of - sight , or @xmath43 .",
    "the 21-cm power spectrum in redshift space in a spherical shell at a fixed value of @xmath41 can be written as a fourth - order polynomial in @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite showed that in the limit of linear fluctuations in density , velocity and ionized fraction , the moments of this polynomial are power spectra of various underlying fields , which are themselves independent of @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite extended this to non - linear ionization fluctuations , but linear density and velocity fluctuations .",
    "in this so - called quasi - linear approximation , the power spectrum can be written as : @xmath44 where the moments are : @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the mean brightness temperature , and @xmath47 denotes the fractional over - density of the quantity @xmath48 . note that the zero - th moment is the power spectrum that would be observed if there were no redshift space distortions in the signal , i.e.  it is the 21-cm power spectrum in real space . @xmath49 is the baryonic matter over - density .",
    "we assume that this is equivalent to the total matter over - density , which is reasonable on all but the smallest scales , where baryons no longer trace the dark matter .",
    "the fourth moment is thus the matter power spectrum familiar from cosmology .",
    "the quasi - linear approximation ignores higher - order terms that become important at small spatial scales and late in the ionization history @xcite . for the scales we are interested in here",
    ", we have found that it provides an adequate approximation for the early stages of reionization ( @xmath50 ) , while comparisons to the quasi - linear approximation at later stages should be interpreted more cautiously .",
    "to simulate the 21-cm signal in redshift space , we used a three - step process .",
    "first , an @xmath0-body simulation was performed to obtain time - evolving density and velocity fields .",
    "then , the reionization of the igm was simulated through a ray - tracing simulation to get the 21-cm brightness temperature .",
    "lastly , we combined the velocity information from the @xmath0-body simulations with the brightness temperature to calculate the 21-cm signal in redshift space .",
    "we also simulated the instrumental noise for lofar observations . to study realistic observations , we simulated galactic and extra - galactic foregrounds .",
    "the foregrounds are only applied in the later part of the paper , in sec .",
    "[ sec : foregrounds ] .",

    "seen how redshift space distortions alter the 21-cm power spectrum , we now investigate to what extent these effects will be visible in upcoming lofar observations .",
    "the extraction of the cosmological 21-cm signal from lofar measurements will face many hurdles .",
    "the signal will be contaminated by factors such as the ionosphere , thermal noise from the instrument and galactic and extragalactic foregrounds . furthermore , sample errors will limit the interpretation of the largest spatial scales . at small spatial scales and in the later stages of reionization ,",
    "non - linearities in the density , velocity and ionized fraction fields may spoil the extraction @xcite . here , we focus first on detector noise and sample error . all the data in this section are calculated from coeval cubes , meaning that we do not take into account any evolution of the signal over the simulation volume  the so - called light - cone effect . in sec .",

    "thermal noise from the instrument will add power to the observations on all scales ; for lofar , the additional power from noise is typically around a factor 10 stronger than the power from the actual signal , for integration times around 5001000 hours .",
    "two methods have been proposed to extract the signal power spectrum from noisy data @xcite .",
    "the first method relies on knowing the shape of the noise power spectrum , which is a reasonable assumption in a real - world scenario : even if the noise power can not be calculated theoretically to the required accuracy , it should be possible to measure it empirically .",
    "if the signal and noise in a measurement are uncorrelated , then the power spectrum of the noisy signal can be written simply as the sum of the signal power spectrum and noise power spectrum : @xmath107 and since @xmath108 is assumed to be known , it can simply be subtracted from the measurements to recover the signal .    of course , due to the nature of noise , we can never know its power spectrum exactly , but only the _ expectation value_. the expectation value will always have an uncertainty , which we calculate here as the standard deviation of a large number of simulated noise realisations .",
    "this noise error , rather than the noise level , is the fundamental limitation to extracting the signal power spectrum from noisy data ( although the actual noise level is important in other contexts , such as foreground removal ; see sec .  [",
    "sec : foregrounds ] ) .",
    "the second method does not assume any knowledge of the noise power spectrum .",
    "it involves splitting the observing period into two sub - epochs and cross - correlating these .",
    "if the signal plus noise in fourier space for sub - epoch @xmath109 is @xmath110 , then the cross - power spectrum between two sub - epochs is : @xmath111 since the two noise realisations will be uncorrelated , while the signal is the same .",
    "the downside of this method is that foreground subtraction must be carried out separately on the two sub - epochs in order for the cross - terms to vanish @xcite . since each sub - epoch will have lower signal - to - noise than the full data set",
    ", this may impact the quality of the foreground subtractions negatively .    to see how well the @xmath42 dependent power spectrum can be extracted from noisy data , we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig : detectability ] our simulated signal to the noise error .",

    "for each of the four panels we have taken the power spectrum at a spherical shell where @xmath112 is fixed and binned it into bins of constant @xmath42 . note that if redshift space distortions were not taken into account , there would be no dependency on @xmath42 , and all of these curves would be flat .    in choosing the width of the bins one is inevitably making a trade - off between an accurate representation of the signal and good noise properties .",
    "here , and for the rest of the paper , we use logarithmic @xmath41 bins of width @xmath113 . for @xmath42 , we use 10 linearly spaced bins .",
    "we have found that we need such wide @xmath41 bins in order to properly reconstruct the signal at reasonable integration times .",
    "however , the wide bins will introduce some averaging effects to our signal .    for each @xmath41 value in fig .",
    "[ fig : detectability ] we show the simulated lofar noise power spectrum error for a 1000 hour observation , based on 100 noise realisations ( black dotted lines ) .",
    "we also show the sample errors of the signal as error bars .",
    "the sample error is calculated as @xmath114 where @xmath69 is the number of fourier modes that go into the calculation of @xmath115 at @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath69 here comes from our simulation volume , which at @xmath116 corresponds to approximately @xmath117 degrees on the sky .",
    "the lofar beam is similar in size , but will not have full sensitivity over the entire field - of - view . on the other hand , the planned lofar observations will eventually comprise several fields , which should bring the sample errors down to levels lower than what we have assumed here .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : detectability ] we see that the noise error completely dominates over the signal on small spatial scales , but goes down for larger spatial scales .",
    "the sample error behaves in the opposite way : it is negligible on the smallest spatial scales , but becomes dominant on large scales . at @xmath41 values somewhere between @xmath118 mpc@xmath2 and @xmath119 mpc@xmath2 ( corresponding roughly to angular scales of 1050 arcmin at @xmath120 ) there is a sweet spot where both the noise and the sample errors are low enough that the @xmath42 dependency of the power spectrum should be observable with lofar , and as fig .",
    "[ fig : terms_ratio ] shows , there are indeed large anisotropies around these @xmath41 values .            to test whether this extraction works",

    "for each such signal+noise cube , we calculated the power spectrum and binned it in @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we then subtracted the expected noise power spectrum  calculated as the mean of many noise realisations  to get the signal power spectrum , according to eq .  .",
    "for each extracted signal power spectrum , we took a specific @xmath41 bin and fit a fourth - degree polynomial in @xmath42 using a standard least - squares fit with the ansatz that @xmath121 .",

    "it is clear that even at these very low noise levels , the errors on the individual terms are very large ( compare the signal - to - noise here to the simulated lofar noise error of fig .  [",
    "fig : detectability ] , which is of the same order as the signal , i.e.  about a factor 5 worse than the worst case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : term_leakage ] ) .",
    "however , the sum of the two terms is much more resilient to the noise , and follows the quasi - linear expectation rather well .",
    "the leakage of the two terms into each other is a direct consequence of the fact that @xmath122 and @xmath123 form a non - orthogonal basis .",

    "the anisotropy does affect the signal , but the effect is of a similar magnitude as the uncertainty due to the noise .",
    "after 1000 hours , there is a fairly strong anisotropy at @xmath124 mpc@xmath2 , and for @xmath125 mpc@xmath2 , virtually all mock observations show a positive anisotropy . for 2000 hours",

    ", the situation looks a bit worse , with some realizations giving errors up to several tens of percent even at long observing times .",

    "observations of the 21-cm emission from the epoch of reionization will inevitably be distorted by the peculiar velocities of the gas in the intergalactic medium . a detailed understanding of how such redshift space distortions affect the 21-cm signal will be crucial for interpreting future observations .",
    "we have simulated the effects of redshift space distortions on the 21-cm power spectrum from the epoch of reionization , specifically focused on the anisotropy introduced in the signal . as was already seen in @xcite",
    ", redshift space distortions strongly affect the 21-cm power spectrum on large scales in the early stages of reionization ( around 1030 per cent global ionization fraction ) . here",
    ", we have focused specifically on the evolution of the anisotropy .",
    "we have shown how , for our reionization model , the power spectrum becomes highly anisotropic in the early stages of reionization , particularly at large spatial scales ( @xmath1 mpc@xmath2 ) .",
    "initially , the power spectrum has a positive dependence on @xmath137 for the small values of @xmath41 considered here .",
    "as reionization progresses , the increased anti - correlation between the neutral and total matter densities causes the power spectrum to flatten , and eventually depend negatively on @xmath127 .",
    "we have also studied the observability of the anisotropies with lofar .",
    "the range of scales around @xmath138@xmath119 mpc@xmath2 ( corresponding roughly 1050 arcminutes on the sky ) seems most promising as both the instrument noise and the sample errors are low enough , and foregrounds can be removed with decent accuracy .",
    "these scales also happen to correspond to the region in @xmath41 space with the strongest anisotropies .",
    "a @xmath3 1000 hour observation with lofar should reveal anisotropies in the power spectrum , unless the reionization history is significantly different from the scenario in our simulations ( for example , a very early reionization would put most of the anisotropies in a frequency range where the noise is higher than we have assumed here ) .",
    "the mere detection of anisotropies in the 21-cm power spectrum would be useful as a check to make sure that the detected signal is indeed the signal from the eor . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : extracted_terms ] , it would be highly unlikely to observe for 2000 hours and not detect any anisotropy in the power spectrum .",
    "this also shows that when fitting a model to an observed 21-cm power spectrum , it is important to include the effects of redshift space distortions in the model . as fig .",
    "[ fig : spherical_ratio ] indicates , failure to do so may result in systematic errors of several hundred percent .",
    "alternatively , one may use an extraction scheme , such as the one shown in this paper , to remove the anisotropy terms and obtain @xmath103 , which is just the power spectrum that would be observed in the absence of redshift space distortions .    going to longer observing times",
    ", it becomes possible to study the evolution of the anisotropy more quantitatively .",
    "while isolating the @xmath123 term  as was suggested by @xcite  seems unrealistic for the noise levels obtainable by lofar , the sum of the anisotropy terms can be used to extract information about the reionization history . we have shown that an inside - out reionization scenario gives an anisotropy that is initially positive , and later decreases and turns negative at around 2030 per cent global ionized fraction for the range of @xmath41 modes considered here .",
    "while this anisotropy evolution alone may not be enough to distinguish the details of a particular reionization history , it provides an additional observable that reionization models will have to reproduce and can be used to exclude at least the more extreme outside - in models .    in conclusion , the subject of 21-cm redshift space distortions seems to warrant further attention .",
    "far from being just a nuisance when interpreting observations , redshift space distortions are yet another example of the wealth of astrophysical and cosmological information that lies hidden in the 21-cm signal from the eor . among the most pressing questions in a short time - perspective is the universality of the anisotropy evolution that we have shown here . while it seems clear that extreme models , such as our outside - in toy model , can be excluded by lofar observations , it is not obvious how more subtle changes in the model assumptions will affect the anisotropy .",
    "a related issue is our assumption that @xmath32 . for this to be true",
    ", the spin temperature must be coupled to the gas temperature , and the igm must be heated quickly by the first sources , before reionization gets started .",
    "if the heating phase is more extended , and overlaps with the reionization phase , the 21-cm signal will contain additional power from @xmath17 fluctuations @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that in certain models , the spherically averaged 21-cm power spectrum can be enhanced by a factor 10100 by spin temperature fluctuations in the early stages of reionization .",
    "if so , the 21-cm signal will be easier to detect , but since the @xmath17 fluctuations are likely correlated with the @xmath131 fluctuations , the quasi - linear approximation used here would no longer be valid , and the physical interpretation of the redshift space distortions would be more complicated . however , it may be possible to determine from observations whether a certain redshift lies in the high @xmath17 regime or not @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the anisotropy evolution can better be extracted by assuming that the cosmological model is well known ( eliminating the uncertainties in the @xmath123 term ) , or by using a different decomposition of the power spectrum .",
    "the @xmath42 decomposition used here has the advantage of offering simple physical interpretations of the different moments , but has the disadvantage of not forming an orthogonal basis  hence our focus on the sum of the anisotropy terms .",
    "other decompositions , such as legendre polynomials , avoid these problems , but the results may be more difficult to interpret .    on longer time - scales , the square kilometre array ( ska ) will deliver observations with a signal - to - noise that will far exceed that of lofar , which may facilitate the extraction of the pure cosmological information contained in the @xmath123 term .",

    "<S> such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properly understood , but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of 21-cm radiation from the eor using large scale @xmath0-body and radiative transfer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrum by redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionization progresses and how it relates to the underlying physics . </S>",
    "<S> we go on to study the effects of redshift space distortions on lofar observations , taking instrument noise and foreground subtraction into account . </S>",
    "<S> we find that lofar should be able to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift space distortions at spatial scales around @xmath1  mpc@xmath2 after @xmath3 1000 hours of integration time . at larger scales , sample errors </S>",
    "<S> become a limiting factor , while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds make the extraction of the signal problematic . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how the astrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the 21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from lofar observations , and how it can be used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios .    </S>",
