    "the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation plays a crucial role in the distance ladder which can ultimately be used to determine hubble constant .",
    "the current most widely used pl relation is based on the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cepheids ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cepheid pl relation has long been considered to be a linear function of @xmath1 within the range of @xmath2 to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pulsation period in days .",
    "current versions of the lmc pl relations can be found , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies @xcite strongly suggest that the lmc pl relation is not linear , as there are two pl relations for the short ( @xmath5 days ) and the long ( @xmath6 days ) period lmc cepheids , respectively .",
    "these studies are mainly based on the optical data ( _ bvi_-band ) from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) database for the fundamental mode cepheids . the non - linear _ v_- and _ i_-band",
    "lmc pl relations are further supported by the results from a rigorous statistical test , the @xmath0-test , as described in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter kn ) .",
    "this @xmath0-test _ is _ sensitive to the number of data points and the nature of the data on either side of 10 days .",
    "this sensitivity is such that if , either the number of data points is small or the data has a large scatter , the slopes on either side of 10 days are not well defined and the test returns a non - significant result .",
    "we describe this property of the @xmath0-test in detail in section 3 .",
    "hence the work of kn , which used the ogle data alone and found marked non - linearities in the pl ( and pc , period - colour ) relations in the lmc at a period of 10 days is in contrast to @xcite , who state that the ogle data _ alone _ do not show any non - linear behavior or break at a period of 10 days .",
    "since the ogle cepheid data are truncated at @xmath7 @xcite , @xcite used additional _",
    "bvi_-band data that are available from the literature , especially those with @xmath8 , to further support the existence of two pl relations in the lmc cepheids . compared to previous studies , the large number of lmc cepheids with high quality photometric data , together with the estimation of extinction ( @xmath9 $ ] ) to individual cepheids , given in the ogle database has made the detection of non - linear lmc pl relation becomes possible .",
    "the non - linearity of cepheid pl relations has been recognized for some time in the literature , as the mean magnitudes for some of the long period cepheids ( @xmath10\\gtrsim 1.5 $ ] ) do not follow the best - fit lines .",
    "in fact , some of the earlier studies ( including the works of kukarkin , shapley & fernie ) on the cepheid pl relation have suggested or used a quadratic form , @xmath11 ^ 2 $ ] , to describe the pl relation @xcite .",
    "for example , a semi - empirical derivation of the quadratic pl relations in the _ b_- and _ v_-band can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the composite pl relations at mean and maximum light constructed with cepheids in different galaxies , as presented in @xcite , also show some curvature of the pl relations . in terms of theoretical modeling ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have fit quadratic pl relations to the theoretical periods and magnitudes obtained from the pulsational modeling .",
    "the non - linearity of the pl relations , however , can also be explained with the broken pl relations : there are two pl relations , for short and long period cepheids respectively , with a break at a specific period ( e.g. , at 10 days ) .",
    "perhaps the earliest idea for the broken pl relation was proposed by kukarkin in 1937 , as quoted from @xcite : `` ... he concluded that the relation was definitely non - linear ... but the best fit was by two straight lines of different slope intersecting at a period of 10 days '' . the present - day version of the broken pl relations is presented in @xcite , kn and @xcite with the ogle data , as mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "these broken pl relation are also compared with the theoretical predictions in @xcite , which show a quite satisfactory agreement .",
    "note that @xcite have fit a broken pl relation to their results obtained from the theoretical models , but with a break at @xmath12 .    besides the non - linear pl relations seen in the lmc cepheids , the smc fundamental mode cepheids also show a change of slope for cepheids with periods less than 2 days from the eros-2 data @xcite .",
    "the authors carefully examine the possible errors or bias in the data that lead to this finding , and conclude that the non - linear pl relations seen in smc cepheids is real .",
    "@xcite explained that this change of the slope for short period ( less than 2 days ) smc cepheids is due to evolutionary effects : this is because the blue loops for these short period smc cepheids do not fully extend into the instability strip .",
    "however , the non - linearity of the lmc pl relation at @xmath13 days period is believed to be independent of this evolutionary effect . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on studying the 10 days non - linearity for the lmc pl relation and do not suggest that this is the same phenomena described by @xcite but for the higher metallicity lmc cepheids .    the motivation of this paper is to extend the work of kn into the study of the linear and/or non - linear nature of the pl relations at / around 10 days for the fundamental mode lmc cepheids .",
    "it it important to verify the non - linearity of the lmc pl relation at 10 days from the studies of @xcite , kn and @xcite , which mainly analyzed the ogle data , with an independent dataset .",
    "hence , we examine the non - linearity of the optical lmc pl relation with the cepheid data obtained from the macho database @xcite in this paper . in addition , we also investigate the lmc pl relations in the near infrared ( nir ) bands ( i.e. , _",
    "jhk_-band ) to see if the nir pl relations also show a non - linearity .",
    "we apply statistical tests to investigate the possible non - linearity of the lmc pl relation in these bands .",
    "we formulate this non - linearity in three ways and examine if the data are more consistent with a linear or non - linear pl relation .    in this paper",
    ", we only use the published mean magnitudes ( and periods ) for the lmc cepheids from the literature .",
    "the data used in this paper is described in section 2 . the statistical analysis and",
    "the results are presented in section 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the conclusion & discussion will be followed in section 5 .",
    "the data for the 1330 fundamental mode lmc cepheids are adopted from @xcite .",
    "this includes the _ v_- and _ r_-band mean magnitudes , as well as the periods , from the macho database and the _ j_- , _ h_- and _ k_-band mean magnitudes from the two micron all sky survey database ( 2mass , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mean magnitudes in the _ v_- and _ r_-bands are computed from the complete light curves with the macho photometric data .",
    "the ( random phase ) magnitudes in _ j_- , _ h_- and _ k_-bands are from the 2mass single epoch observations , hence the mean magnitudes in these nir bands are obtained with a random - phase correction function . the details for obtaining the mean magnitudes in all these bands can be found in @xcite . to check the accuracy of these _ jhk _ mean magnitudes , one of us (",
    "nikolaev et al , 2005  in preparation ) has compared the _ jhk _ mean magnitudes from the 2mass data ( after random - phase correction ) with the @xcite data , which are obtained from the well - sampled ( _ jhk _ ) light curves .",
    "for the 33 matched cepheids in the macho/2mass sample and the @xcite sample , the average difference in the mean magnitudes are : @xmath14 ( with std @xmath15 , where std @xmath16 standard deviation ) , @xmath17 ( std @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( std @xmath20 ) .",
    "these are completely consistent with the zero difference .",
    "more importantly , the plots of the difference between the means in these bands as a function of period ( not shown ) do not show any trends with period , hence the _ jhk _ mean magnitudes from the 2mass database will not seriously affect our analysis and results .",
    "we did not use other datasets in _ vrjhk_-bands , as in @xcite , to perform the main analysis in order to keep our dataset as consistent and homogeneous as possible ( however , see section 5.2 ) .    the next step in the analysis is to obtain the extinction - corrected mean magnitudes for these cepheids .",
    "this was done by applying an extinction map with the following values of @xmath21 ( ratio of total - to - selective reddening , and @xmath22 $ ] ) , in order to be consistent with @xcite : @xmath23 .",
    "the lmc extinction map we used is taken from @xcite . in brief , given the coordinates for each cepheid and a search radius @xmath24 , the extinction map returns the average value of extinction , @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 ) , from the stars bounded within the search radius .",
    "the extinction map allows us to choose the @xmath27 obtained from cool stars ( @xmath28 ) , hot stars ( @xmath29 ) or both .",
    "since cepheid variables are cool stars , we only use the extinction values from the cool stars .",
    "we use @xmath30 to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of stars within the search radius to obtain the @xmath27 ( usually more than 10 stars ) .",
    "however , there are two cepheids with locations beyond the extinction map and one cepheid without any cool stars within the @xmath31 radius . for simplicity",
    ", we assume @xmath32 mag ( roughly the mean extinction of lmc ) for these three cepheids .",
    "after the values of @xmath27 for the cepheids are obtained , the extinctions in other bands are calculated with the following relation : @xmath33 with the errors @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the passband .",
    "we consider the following three samples in this study :    sample a - this sample consist of all 1330 cepheids in our dataset .",
    "sample b - we then remove 8 outliers out of 1330 cepheids ( all of these outliers have @xmath10<0.75 $ ] ) from sample a , as they are fainter by more than @xmath36mag . and",
    "@xmath37mag . in _ v_- and _ r_-band , respectively , to the fitted pl relations at the same period .",
    "the locations of these outliers in the pl relations are plotted in figure [ figoutlier ] .",
    "it is possible that the extinctions for these outliers are underestimated because they are not obvious in the nir pl relations ( see the right panel of figure [ figoutlier ] ) .",
    "another possibility is that they are type ii cepheids that are mis - identified as the classical type i cepheids .",
    "however , it is clear that these outliers should be removed from our sample .",
    "hence sample b consists of 1322 cepheids .",
    "sample c - following @xcite , we also remove the cepheids with @xmath38 from sample b. this is to guard against the possible contamination from first overtone cepheids @xcite , as well as other types of variables such as the anomalous cepheids and the double - mode cepheids @xcite .",
    "in addition , this choice of the period cut will also guard against the possible change of slopes for short ( @xmath39 days ) period cepheids , as seen in the smc cepheids @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite has applied the period cut of @xmath40 to the ogle lmc cepheids to derive the pl relations that were used in other studies , such as the @xmath41 key project @xcite .",
    "hence the same period cut was also applied in previous studies of the non - linear lmc pl relations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the period distribution of the lmc cepheids shows a sharp break at @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to evolutionary effects @xcite .",
    "we contend that these reasons justify the removal of cepheids with @xmath38 , and leaves 1216 cepheids in this sample .",
    "our use of the @xmath0-test , as given in the next section , ensures that such a period cut will not affect our results .",
    "in order to study the linear and/or non - linear nature of the lmc pl relation , the data presented in the previous section are fitted with the ( weighted ) least squares regression ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ordinary least squares regression , @xmath43 , has been extensively used in the literature to obtain the fitted pl relations from observations ( for examples , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and many other papers on pl relation using the galactic cepheids ) as well as from theoretical modelings ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because there is a good physical theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting why the period is the independent variable and is measured essentially without errors , hence the @xmath43 regression can be applied . in terms of observations , the errors of the periods for the macho cepheids used in this paper ( see section 2 ) is about @xmath44 @xcite , which is comparable to the accuracy reported by the ogle team ( @xmath45 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as other high quality photometric observations ( e.g. , see @xcite , and some examples from the galactic cepheids in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath43 regression is also recommended for the distance scale studies @xcite .",
    "the weights ( @xmath46 ) that are used in the regressions are the quadrature sum of the photometric errors in mean magnitudes ( @xmath47 ) , the errors from the random phase corrections that are only applicable to _ jhk_-bands ( @xmath48 ) , the errors from extinction ( @xmath49 ) , and the intrinsic dispersion due to the finite width of the instability strip ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath51 .",
    "the dispersions of the pl relations in each band from @xcite can be initially adopted for @xmath50 . however ,",
    "a comparison of the dispersions given in @xcite with @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggest that the _ vr_-band and the _ jhk_-band dispersions given in @xcite should be scaled by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "hence we adopt the following values for the intrinsic dispersions : @xmath54 .",
    "the adopted @xmath50 , such as those originally given in @xcite , does not affect the results from the following statistical tests .",
    "we also assume that all lmc cepheids are at the same distance so that there is no distance variation in the weight formula .",
    "one way to check for a non - linearity on the lmc pl relation is through a residual plot .",
    "if the one - line regression is adequate , then the residuals should be populated ( roughly ) evenly around the zeroth residual line ( i.e. , independent of period ) . on the other hand , if the residuals show a trend , or some trends , in the residual plot , then more parameters are needed to fit the data .",
    "the residuals of the macho _",
    "v_-band data from previous section are plotted as function of @xmath1 in figure [ figres ] , assuming that the one - line regression is adequate .",
    "a linear fit of the residuals with @xmath55 gives non - zero slopes of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 from sample a , b and c , respectively .",
    "these slopes clearly indicate that the trends seen in figure [ figres ] are significant . hence a one - line regression may not be adequate to fit the macho _ v_-band pl relations .",
    "similar residual plots in other bands are presented in the right panels of figure [ fig1 ] .    to investigate the possible non - linearity of the pl relations",
    ", we applied the chi - square test and the @xmath0-test ( as given in * ? ? ? * and used initially in kn ) using the weighted least squares results .",
    "the null ( @xmath59 ) and the alternate ( @xmath60 ) hypothesis represent the reduced and the full models , respectively , where the reduced models are obtained by setting some parameters in the full models to certain specific values ( e.g. , zero , see @xcite ) .",
    "hence our reduced model is a one - line regression ( 2-parameter ) fit to the entire period range , and the null hypothesis , @xmath59 , is that one - line regression is adequate to describe the data .",
    "in contrast , @xmath60 is that the full model is necessary to fit the data . here",
    ", we consider three different kinds of full models :    1 .   a two - line regression ( 4-parameter ) with a break at a characteristic period , @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 2 .   a piecewise continuous regression ( 3-parameter ) that forces the two - line regression to be continuous at @xmath61 , i.e. , + @xmath63 \\nonumber \\\\             & & + e\\times \\mathrm{max}[0,\\log(p)-\\log(p_o ) ] .",

    "although we consider these three models , our main interest is in the investigation of a change of slope in the lmc pl relation for short and long period cepheids .",
    "it is clear that two lines of differing slope , continuous at @xmath61 and even perhaps with a small discontinuity at @xmath61 , are approximately a quadratic with a local minimum / maximum derivative at @xmath61 .    to apply the chi - square test and the @xmath0-test , we then calculated the weighted error sum of squares , @xmath65 ^ 2/w(i)$ ] , for both @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the observed magnitudes and the fitted magnitudes from weighted least squares for @xmath68 cepheid , respectively . under @xmath59 , the difference of the @xmath69",

    "this is essentially the same as applying a standard @xmath0-test ( which many regression packages produce ) under weighted least squares , where    @xmath75    which is approximately a @xmath76 distribution under the null hypothesis ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath77 is given in equation ( 4 ) . the corresponding probability ( @xmath78 ) for the @xmath77 and the @xmath0-values , under @xmath59 , can be obtained from consulting the standard statistical books or softwares .",
    "a large value of @xmath77 and/or @xmath0 ( hence small @xmath78 ) indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected , and therefore the data is more consistent with the alternate hypothesis .",

    "the chi - square test , as formulated above , does not depend on homoskedasticity and hence we use it in this study to supplement our @xmath0-test results . perhaps a simpler chi - square test is the following : compare the chi - square statistic for a one- and two - line regression respectively .",

    "the linearity of the pl relation in each band again can be tested by comparing the @xmath0-values in this table with table [ tabp ] .",
    "as can be seen from the table , including the additional long period cepheids does not alter the main conclusion we have : the _ vrjh_-band pl relation is non - linear and the _ k_-band pl relation is ( marginally ) linear .",
    "since there are no measurement errors given in @xcite for the _ v _ and _ r _ mean magnitudes , the results in table [ tabflong ] are derived with unweighted regression ( i.e. @xmath89 ) in all bands .",
    "the @xmath0-values from using the weighted regressions to all bands , with assumed some values for the errors in the _ v_- and _ r_-band means ( and the @xmath9 $ ] , the errors for _ jhk _ means are given in @xcite ) , are very similar to table [ tabflong ] .",
    "one exception is the @xmath0-value for the _ k_-band when using all available long period cepheids , the @xmath0-value goes down from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , which is fully consistent with a one - line regression . in this table , except for the _ k_-band , the lowest significant @xmath0-value is 7.872 . with the degrees of freedom appropriate for the data in our study , this has a @xmath78-value less than @xmath92 ( recall that @xmath93 for @xmath82 ) .",
    "this means that assuming the null hypothesis of a single regression line being sufficient .",
    "the chance of getting a value of the @xmath0 statistic as high or greater than that actually observed ( 7.872 ) is less than @xmath92 .",
    "could reddening and extinction errors produce our results ?  figure [ figpc ] displays extinction corrected pc relations , at mean light , obtained from the macho+2mass data for a variety of colours : @xmath94 & @xmath95 . this figure and the pc relations presented in kn and @xcite",
    "imply that in order to make a linear pc relation , extinction errors would have to be of the order of @xmath96-@xmath97 mag .",
    "for the longer period cepheids . if this were indeed the case , the same error would apply to pc relations at maximum light .",
    "again , longer period cepheids obey a flat pc relation at maximum light ( kn , skm , code 1947 ) , an observation for which there is a sound theoretical argument ( see the reference given in section 5.2 ) .",
    "if these longer period cepheids suffered an extinction error of @xmath96-@xmath97 mag .",
    ", then the true underlying pc relation at maximum light would be such that as the period increases the colour becomes bluer ( that is the temperature is hotter ) at maximum light .",
    "it is hard to incorporate this in the theoretical framework of @xcite , since this paper suggested that for very long period cepheids ( @xmath10 > 1.5 $ ] roughly ) , the pc relation at maximum light then starts to have a slope such that cepheids become redder as the period gets longer .",
    "this is in the opposite way to what would need to be true were the pc relation to be linear at mean light .",
    "further , if reddening / extinction errors are indeed making the pc / pl relation appear to be non - linear then the extinction / reddening from two independent methods , as used by the ogle team and that used in this study , would both need to contain errors of the order of @xmath96-@xmath97 mag . for the longer period cepheids .",
    "although longer period cepheids are generally younger and as such may be surrounded by dust shells which could increase extinction with period and possibly produce a non - linear pc relation as is observed .",
    "we argue again that our knowledge of the properties of cepheids at maximum light as presented above argues against this .",
    "further such an effect would be gradual , however the observed pc relation is sharply non - linear as is evident in the left panel of figure [ figmulti ] . the use of two extinction maps , one for the ogle data and another one in this study , to correct for the extinction / reddening that produce similar results also suggest the effect of the extinction is minimal .",
    "the anonymous referee has also suggested the following to test to examine if our extinction corrections do indeed represent individual corrections : plotting the residuals from the _ v_- and _ r_-band pl relations against each other ( see , e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the idea is that if the residuals lie along the reddening line , then the reddening corrections do not represent individual corrections .",
    "we carried out such a test with sample c using the pl relations from a one - line and two - line regression .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig7 ] . from the figure",
    "it can be seen that the dispersion is reduced when using the one - line regressions as compared to the two - line regression .",
    "the points lie along the reddening line .",
    "we , however , argue that this test is not suitable for testing the extinction corrections for the following reasons . first of all , besides the statistical fluctuations",
    ", the residuals from the pl relation are expected to originate from three sources @xcite : ( a ) depth dispersion / effects ( b ) extinction , and ( c ) intrinsic dispersion due to the width of the instability strip .",
    "all three sources will tend to make the residuals be correlated in the _",
    "v_- and _ r_-bands , as seen in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "we ignore the discussion of the depth effect ( represented as dashed lines in figure [ fig7 ] ) because we assume the depth effect is negligible for the lmc cepheids .",
    "for the source from extinction , recall that the the extinction correction for a cepheid is calculated using @xmath98 , where the @xmath99 value is either the mean value of the lmc or an estimated value for individual cepheids . hence a correlation of the residuals is naturally introduced ( represented as solid lines in figure [ fig7 ] ) for the reddening vector used in this paper ( section 2 ) , because @xmath100 constant . even for a hypothetical group of cepheids that are free from extinction and depth dispersion , the residuals of the _ v_- and _ r_-band pl relations will still be correlated .",
    "this is due to the existence of the instability strip and the plc relation @xcite . therefore mapping the cepheids from the instability strip ( along the constant - period line ) to the _ v_- and _",
    "r_-band pl relations will cause the residuals to be unavoidably correlated . unfortunately",
    ", this line of residuals is very close to the reddening line in the residual plots ( not shown in figure [ fig7 ] , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this makes it hard to say whether the correlation of the residuals seen in figure [ fig7 ] is caused by the extinction or the width of the instability strip mag . )",
    "is comparable to the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is not a surprise because:(a ) cepheids in the observed instability strip are roughly normally distributed ( with @xmath101 and dominate the overall distribution ) ; and ( b ) the measurement and extinction errors are also roughly normally distributed .",
    "hence the overall distribution is also normally distributed with tails extended to @xmath102 mag . at both ends . ] .    in this paper",
    "we have tried our best to correct for the extinction of the lmc cepheids . based on the above arguments we believe that extinction errors are not the physical cause for the observed non - linear lmc pl relations .",
    "other physical reasons , such as the pulsational properties @xcite and/or the internal structure @xcite of the cepheid variables ( we refer to these as `` internal reasons '' as opposed to the `` external reasons '' like dust extinction ) may be responsible for the observed non - linear pl relations . we have provided compelling evidence that the ( extinction corrected ) cepheid pl relation in the lmc is non - linear around a period of 10 days in the optical _ v_- & _ r_-bands . assuming the random phase corrections methods used in this study , we also find the pl relation in the _",
    "j_- & _ h_-band to be non - linear around this period but that the _",
