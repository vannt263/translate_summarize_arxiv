    "the nature of the phase transition(s ) to quark - gluon plasma , which we hope to see in the experiments of rhic and later of lhc , and the physics driving it , have always been of great interest .",
    "while the real world has presumably two very light ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) flavours of quarks and one somewhat heavier ( @xmath9 ) flavour , both analytical and numerical methods in lattice qcd begin from the limiting cases of either massless or infinitely massive quarks .",
    "one talks of the chiral symmetry restoring phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition in these two cases respectively and has suitable order parameters to investigate them . for quarks with @xmath10 colours and @xmath11 massless flavours ,",
    "these transitions are related to spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath12 and @xmath13 chiral symmetry .",
    "since these symmetries are broken explicitly to various extents in the real world , which of them is more relevant is _ a priori _ not clear .",
    "the low masses of the light flavours suggest chiral symmetry to be the dominant one",
    ". however , it is seen in numerical simulations that the energy density shows a large change at the chiral transition and even the order parameter for the deconfinement transition , @xmath14 also rises to nonzero values there .",
    "these apparently mysterious observations can be explained@xcite using large @xmath10 arguments , _ if _ the deconfinement transition for @xmath15 is of _ second order_. @xmath0 is clearly the simplest case to check this out .",
    "numerical simulations of @xmath0 theory at finite temperatures have been done in the past@xcite and recently@xcite as well .",
    "all of them used the wilson action , or the more general mixed action : @xmath16~,~ \\label{mxd}\\ ] ] a well known problem in the simulations with these actions , especially for large @xmath10 , is the presence of a bulk transition which is a lattice artifact .",
    "the phase diagram of the mixed action ,    [ fg.phd ]    in its coupling plane is as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg.phd ] .",
    "the solid lines in it show first order bulk transitions lines .",
    "the dotted line after the end point d is drawn to suggest the impact d may have on the wilson axis ( @xmath17 = 0 ) .",
    "for @xmath15 , d is expected to be where e is shown , causing a first order bulk transition for the usual wilson action . in order to avoid it , simulations at negative @xmath17 @xcite and for larger @xcite",
    "@xmath3 = 6 were made .",
    "they lead to a first order deconfinement phase transition for @xmath0 .    from our extensive studies@xcite of the deconfinement phase transition for the action above but for the @xmath18 theory",
    ", we know that bulk transitions affect the order and location of the deconfinement transition in subtle and inexplicable ways , even leading to apparent qualitative violations of universality . universality was restored @xcite in that case only after eliminating the bulk transitions associated with the @xmath19 vortices and @xmath19 monopoles by adding large chemical potentials for them .",
    "it seems natural to expect that the bulk transitions for @xmath20 can also be cleaned off by suppressing the corresponding @xmath12 objects .",
    "we pursue this idea here for @xmath0 to investigate its deconfinement phase transition .",
    "generalizing the idea of positive plaquette models@xcite in the literature , we use the action @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the phase of tr @xmath23 . by adding the adjoint term of eq .",
    "( 2 ) to the action ( 3 ) , one sees that the phase diagram of the resultant mixed should not have the bulk lines ac or bc and hence the endpoint d or e.    we have simulated the above action on @xmath1 lattices for @xmath2 = 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 16 and @xmath3 = 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 using a 15-hit metropolis et al .",
    "the calculations were done on a cluster of pentiums .",
    "typically short runs to look for points of rapid variations in @xmath24 were followed by long runs ( a few million sweeps ) to determine the susceptibility @xmath25 using the histogramming technique .",
    "usual finite size scaling techniques were used to determine the order of the transition and its exponents .    in simulations on @xmath26 lattices ,",
    "@xmath27 8 , 10 , 12 , one sees hot and cold starts converge quickly at couplings a little away from the transition point on its both sides but a clear co - existence of states is visible for all lattices at the transition point .",
    "the tunneling frequency goes down with spatial volume .",
    "the histograms of @xmath28 show peaks which become narrower with increasing volume and the gap between them remains unchanged .",
    "these classic signs of a first order phase transition are confirmed by a quantitative analysis of the linear growth of @xmath25 with volume , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fg.susc ] .",
    "the horizontal lines in each case are predictions obtained by scaling the @xmath29 results linearly with volume .",
    "[ fg.susc ]    for larger @xmath3 , we used many longer runs in the region of strong variation of @xmath30 to obtain the susceptibility directly and used the histogramming only for the finer determination of the critical coupling .",
    "our results for @xmath31 as a function of @xmath32 clearly show the expected shift for a deconfinement phase transition for @xmath3 = 5 , 6 and 8 .",
    "this is evident in the @xmath33 determinations from the @xmath4 , as seen in table 1 for @xmath3 = 6 for two different spatial volumes .",
    "again , using the peak height for the smaller spatial volume , the @xmath34 on the bigger lattice can be predicted , assuming a linear growth with volume .",
    "the prediction listed in the table can be seen to be in very good agreement with the direct monte carlo determination . along with the shifts in @xmath32 , it confirms that the same _ physical _ deconfinement phase transition is being simulated on these lattices thus approaching the continuum limit of @xmath35 in a progressive manner by keeping the transition temperature @xmath6 constant in physical units .",

    "the linear growth of @xmath4 with volume for @xmath3 = 4 , suggests a _ first _ order deconfinement phase transition for @xmath0 .",
    "various indicators , such as , histograms and evolutions , are in accord with this . increasing @xmath3 to 5 , 6 and 8 shows the expected shift of the deconfinement transition , with a growth in @xmath4 that is consistent with being linear in volume .",
    "the plaquette discontinuity @xmath38 decreases as the fourth power of @xmath3 , indicating both a lack of a bulk transition and a first order deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the large estimated latent heat , being about 2/3 of the corresponding ideal gas energy density , suggests the deconfinement transition to grow stronger in nature as the number of colours in increased ."
