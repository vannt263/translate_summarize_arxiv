    "density functional theory ( dft)@xcite has become a standard tool for electronic structure calculations of atoms , molecules and materials thanks to the widely used local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and generalized gradient ones ( gga ) @xcite to the exchange - correlation functionals in the kohn - sham ( ks ) formulation .",
    "these approximations describe well many properties  such as cohesion , bonds , structures , vibrations , etc. of densely packed molecules and materials when covalent , metallic or hydrogen bonds are involved .",
    "however , they fail when applied to systems having regions of small overlapping density where long range correlation effects , which are not treated correctly in lda and gga , are important .",
    "these kinds of systems are frequently met in nature , e.g. in biomolecules , as well as in physical and chemical processes , such as , for instance , in molecular adsorption on surfaces , chemical reactions , etc .",
    "the simplest paradigmatic examples of these weakly bonded systems are dimers of noble gas atoms and/or closed - shell molecules and several works in the literature exists where the van der waals ( vdw ) @xmath0 coefficients are calculated within dft at different levels of sophistication , ranging from a crude treatment of response functions in term of electronic densities @xcite to full calculations within the time - dependent dft framework .",
    "@xcite    during the past decade , many attempts have been done to improve performances of dft calculations in these systems,@xcite by including explicitly in the exchange and correlation functional non - local correlations , that are missing both in lda and in gga . the general staring point in all these approaches",
    "is the so - called adiabatic connection fluctuation - dissipation ( acfd)@xcite expression for the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy , where an exact formula is used , giving this quantity through dynamical response functions of all fictitious systems which connect the non - interacting ks system with the real many - body interacting one .",
    "these calculations are however extremely demanding for practical applications and have been performed only for a limited number of systems so far @xcite .",
    "recently , an approximate scheme has been proposed where the acfd was used as starting point for further simplifications and which has demonstrated to be able to account for van der waals interaction with some success for a number of cases.@xcite    in our opinion , more calculations and further developments need to be pursued in order to explore the potential offered by an approximate treatment of acfd for the calculation of accurate exchange - correlation energies .",
    "our aim in this work is to assess the possibility of accurately approximate the frequency dependent response function of a system starting from the thomas - fermi and von weizscker ( tfvw ) approximation for the non - interacting kinetic energy functional .",
    "only the dipolar response function responsible for the asymptotic dispersion interaction between non overlapping fragments will be considered here .",
    "the encouraging results obtained for the @xmath0 coefficients will give support to the possibility of using similar procedures in the extremely demanding calculation of accurate correlation energy based on acfd .",
    "the use of approximate kinetic energy functionals to evaluate dynamical response properties of materials is not a new idea@xcite but is constantly appealing one and , for instance , barejee and harbola@xcite have recently calculated approximate vdw coefficients for large alkali metal cluster using an tfvw approximation in conjunction with an hydrodynamical approach to the collective excitation of the system .    in this study",
    "we follow a different approach to the same problem , where , starting from thomas - fermi and von weizscker approximation for kinetic energy functional , we develop a simple and computationally fast procedure to calculate imaginary - frequency - dependent polarizability  hence the van der waals interaction in the asymptotic region  by density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt).@xcite our method contains the following ingredients : ( i ) the ground - state ( gs ) electronic density , @xmath1 , which is accurately computed from the standard ks procedure within lda or gga ; ( ii ) a single auxiliary wave function , @xmath2 , corresponding to the gs density , and the auxiliary hamiltonian admitting @xmath2 as its gs eigenfunction in the tfvw approximation ; ( iii ) the so - called modified sternheimer equation which is used to calculate the imaginary - frequency polarizability of the system .",
    "this procedure can be considered as a simplification of the one proposed by mahan @xcite and others @xcite more than twenty years ago for the exact  within lda / gga dft ",
    "calculation of atomic and molecular polarizabilities .",
    "the original scheme becomes very demanding for systems having a large number of electrons while our approximate treatment , dealing only with one single auxiliary wavefunction , can deal efficiently with systems of any number of electrons .",
    "this scheme could be a good starting point , we believe , for developing an approximation of the xc - energy functional which is simple enough to allow broad applications but still capture the essence of van der waals energies.@xcite moreover , it could also be useful for calculating vdw coefficients of fragments which are needed in some semi - empirical treatments of vdw energy in dft such as the damped - dispersion force method .",
    "from the theoretical point of view , van der waals coefficients are most conveniently determined through the frequency - dependent polarizability , @xmath3 , of the system thanks to the relation @xmath4 in the framework of density functional theory , the static polarizability , @xmath5 can be obtained from the density response of the system under a uniform external electric field ( along the z - axis ) via @xmath6 an efficient computational technique for calculation of density response that avoids the computation of unoccupied states of the independent - particle hamiltonian has been proposed by sternheimer  @xcite more than fifty years ago for atomic polarizability calculations .",
    "the method was later modified by mahan@xcite to include a self - consistent treatment of the electrons for the calculation of atomic polarizabilities within density - functional theory in lda .",
    "the linear density - response , @xmath7 , to an external perturbation , @xmath8 , is determined by the following self - consistent set of linear equations , @xmath9 , \\\\ & & \\delta v_{ks } = \\delta v_{ext } + \\delta v_{h } + \\delta v_{xc } , \\\\ & & \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla^2}{2 } + v_{ks } - \\varepsilon_i \\right ] \\delta\\psi_i = - [ \\delta v_{ks } - \\delta\\varepsilon_i]\\psi_i,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sums run on the set of occupied orbitals only .",
    "a generalization of the method for calculation of polarizability at a finite imaginary frequency ( see below ) was also made by mahan and was used to calculate the van der waals coefficients for a number of atomic systems.@xcite the method has later been adapted and successfully applied to the case of extended periodic systems where it is better known as density functional perturbation theory.@xcite this approach is exact within lda dft , however , computationally demanding since the computational cost grows as the third power of the system size .",
    "one possible way to reduce the computational cost involved in the dfpt calculation of static and dynamical response functions is to approximate the non interacting kinetic energy with some orbital free functional , as in the tfvw scheme .",
    "let us assume that the gs density distribution , @xmath1 , of an atomic or molecular system has been computed accurately within the ks scheme , employing , for instance , lda or gga as xc - functional , and let us introduce the auxiliary wave function @xmath2 , which is normalized to unit and simply related to the electron density as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of electrons in the system .",
    "the crucial point in our scheme is the assumption that the response of the system around its gs density can be approximated by using the tfvw functional for the kinetic energy . in this approximation",
    "the total energy functional in term of @xmath2 reads @xmath12 & = & \\alpha \\int [ n\\varphi]^{5/3}d\\mathbf{r } +                 \\frac{n}{2}\\int|\\nabla\\varphi|^2d\\mathbf{r } +                  e_h[\\varphi ]   + \\notag \\\\                  & ~&e_{xc}[\\varphi ] + e_{ext}[\\varphi ] -n\\mu\\left[\\int |\\varphi|^2d\\mathbf{r } - 1\\right ] , \\label{ephi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the lagrange multiplier used to enforce normalization ( rydberg atomic units are used throughout the text ) .",
    "the choice of this approximation is inspired by the fact that the vw correction term gives the exact kinetic energy in regions where only one wave function is relevant , typically the asymptotic region of atoms or molecules .",
    "moreover , the dominant contributions to the polarizability come from the loosely bound electrons in this region , that are thus expected to be captured in this approximation .    the corresponding euler equation of eq .",
    "( [ ephi ] ) determines @xmath2 @xmath15\\varphi({\\mathbf{r}})=0 , \\label{tfvw - eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the local fermi wave - vector .",
    "if @xmath17 is given , an approximate gs density in tfvw approximation can be obtained by solving this equation . here",
    "we invert the reasoning and the density , hence @xmath2 , is assumed to be given and an auxiliary effective potential , denoted by @xmath18 , is constructed such that the corresponding hamiltonian admits @xmath19 as its gs eigenfunction .",
    "it can be formally written as @xmath20 and @xmath18 can be found from this equation once @xmath19 is known , even if some care must be taken in the asymptotic region where the density , and hence @xmath19 , vanishes exponentially .",
    "the linear density - response to an external perturbation is determined by the following self - consistent set of equations , @xmath21 , \\\\ & & \\delta v_{eff } = \\delta v_{ext } + \\delta v_{h } + \\delta v_{xc } +                        \\frac{k_f^2}{3n}\\delta n , \\\\ & & \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla^2}{2 } + v_{eff } - \\mu \\right ] \\delta\\varphi = - [ \\delta v_{eff } - \\delta\\mu]\\varphi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , which satisfies the orthogonal condition @xmath24 , is the first order change of the wave function brought about by the external field .",
    "once this set of equations is solved , static polarizability is calculated from eq .",
    "( [ alpha0 ] ) . in order to find the polarizability at finite imaginary frequency , @xmath3 ,",
    "the above procedure is slightly modified by adding a frequency term @xmath25 to @xmath14 , making it become a complex quantity @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite from the imaginary - frequency polarizability , @xmath3 , the vdw coefficient @xmath0 can be immediately calculated from eq .",
    "( [ c6 ] ) .",
    "we have chosen to apply our method to calculate dynamic polarizabilities and vdw coefficients for two kinds of systems , namely spherically symmetric ions and some simple molecules to demonstrate the efficiency of the method . by exploiting the symmetry properties of the former systems",
    ", the gs density @xmath27 can be calculated very accurately by integrating the radial ks equations on a logarithmic grid with the highly accurate numerov s algorithm . in this case",
    "the effective potential @xmath18 can be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) . for the latter ,",
    "the situation is more complicated because all quantities are calculated within the plane - wave pseudopotential method and are expanded in fourier components up to a given kinetic - energy cut - off which makes the inversion needed in eq .",
    "[ veff ] numerically difficult .",
    "we have overcome this difficulty by an _ iterative optimization process _ inspired by the method described in ref .",
    ", for the determination of the optimized effective potential starting from an accurate density : assuming that at a given iteration , @xmath28 , the approximate effective potential is @xmath29 a residual quantity @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 \\varphi({\\mathbf{r } } ) .\\ ] ] this quantity vanishes everywhere only if the hamiltonian corresponding to this potential admits @xmath19 as its gs eigenfunction .",
    "as long as this is not the case the potential is updated as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are chosen in such a way that the norm of the new residual @xmath35 ^ 2 $ ] is minimized .",
    "the process is terminated when the integrated charge difference @xmath36 is less than a given threshold , practically chosen to be of the order of @xmath37 .",

    "scaledwidth=45.0% ]    numerical results for closed - shell ions show a good agreement with those obtained by mahan with an accurate but more expensive calculation for a wide range of atomic number and frequency .",
    "this can be seen in fig . 1 where frequency - dependent polarizabilities of some closed - shell ions obtained by the two methods are compared .",
    "in table [ c6 ] calculated values of vdw coefficients for a number of pairs of rare gases are given .",
    "our results are all in the range and at least as accurate as those reported in ref . when compared to the reference ones .    in fig .",
    "2 our calculated @xmath0 values both for homonuclear and mixed pairs of @xmath38 ions are plotted against those reported in ref . .",
    "the good agreement between the results obtained by the two methods are indicated by the narrow spread of the points around the diagonal .",
    "quantitatively , the difference never exceeds @xmath39 and in most cases is less than @xmath40 .",
    ".[c6 ] @xmath0 values for dimers ( rydberg atomic units ) . present : our results .",

    "therefore , in the calculations for molecules presented below , a little accuracy has been sacrificed by using only the density of valence electrons in order to reduce the number of plane - wave needed to describe the auxiliary wavefunction of the system .      to exemplify the general scheme , we have calculated dynamic polarizabilities and vdw coefficients of methane and benzene , two molecules with different nature of chemical bonds and geometric structures .",
    "the ks equations for each isolated molecule were solved using periodic boundary conditions in a simple cubic simulation cell with side length of @xmath41 and @xmath42   and kinetic - energy cutoffs of @xmath43 and @xmath44 ry , respectively .",
    "simple lda exchange - correlation functional with norm - conserving pseudopotentials were used to obtain the gs charge density of the isolated molecules .",
    "[ fig : me - ben ] shows the imaginary - frequency dynamic polarizabilities of methane and benzene molecules calculated in our scheme , compared with the result of the full calculation which has also been implemented in the pwscf plane - wave pseudopotential code . for methane molecule ,",
    "the result of our simplified calculation compares excellently with the one of the more accurate method .",
    "although this is not the case for benzene molecule , nevertheless the difference between the two calculations is still rather moderate as expected .",

    "obtained in the full calculation ) while for benzene tfvw approximation overestimate by about 40% the full calculation ( 4.9 @xmath45 a.u .",
    "3.6 @xmath45 a.u . ) .",
    "in this study we have shown that a simple approximation for the ( dynamical ) polarizability of atoms and molecules can be obtained starting from the tfvw approximation to the independent electron kinetic energy functional .",
    "the success of the present approximate method in the calculation of frequency dependent polarizability and vdw coefficients of atomic and molecular systems , together with its computational efficiency , especially for large systems , suggests that it may be a useful tool to explore the behavior of systems where non - local long - range correlations are important .",
    "an algorithmic development of time - dependent density functional theory in real time has recently been proposed by marques and co - workers@xcite that allows for an efficient evaluation of van der waals coefficients from the full kohn - sham response function .",
    "the computational cost for the calculation of c@xmath46 coefficients in this approach grows quadratically with the system size . in our approximate scheme",
    "instead the computational cost grows only linearly with the size of the system .",
    "this is because only one auxiliary wave function is needed no matter how many electrons are present in the system . even for the small atomic and molecular systems considered in this work the computational time required by the simplified calculation",
    "is at least one order of magnitude lower than that of the full calculation and this is expected to become increasingly more convenient for larger systems .",
    "only a systematic comparison of the results obtained for more systems within our approximate scheme as well as within other approaches will allow to better assess the computational and physical merits and limitations of the various approaches .",
