    "the higgs - like particle which has been discovered by the experiments atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite at the lhc has given rise to substantial investigations to reveal the nature of this particle as a higgs boson responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking . besides the presently consistent explanation of the measurements by the standard model higgs boson  @xcite , a large variety of other interpretations is possible where the higgs particle belongs to an extended model connected to physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the observed particle could also be explained as a light state within a richer spectrum of scalar particles as predicted by the theoretically well motivated minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm consists of two complex scalar doublets leading to five physical higgs bosons ( @xmath1-even @xmath2 , @xmath1-odd @xmath3 , charged @xmath4 ) and three ( would - be ) goldstone bosons . at the tree level their masses can be parametrized in terms of the @xmath3-boson mass @xmath5 and the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values , @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath1-violation is induced in the higgs sector via loop contributions involving complex parameters from other susy sectors leading to mixing between @xmath7 and @xmath3 in the mass eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "masses and mixings in the neutral sector are strongly affected by loop contributions .",
    "a lot of work has been invested into higher - order calculations of the mass spectrum for the case of the mssm with real parameters  @xcite as well as complex parameters  @xcite .",
    "the largest loop contributions originate from the top yukawa coupling  @xmath8 , or  .",
    "the class of leading two - loop yukawa - type corrections of @xmath9 has been calculated for the case of real parameters  @xcite , applying the method of the effective potential .",
    "together with the full one - loop result  @xcite and the leading @xmath10 terms  @xcite , both accomplished in the feynman - diagrammatic approach including complex parameters , it has been implemented in the public program feynhiggs  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath9 terms for the complex version of the mssm , also performed in the feynman - diagrammatic approach , has been published recently  @xcite .",
    "an outline of the calculation and sample results for the lightest higgs - boson mass are presented in this talk .",
    "the higgs potential of the complex mssm is given by @xmath11 with the gauge couplings  @xmath12 , the bilinear superpotential parameter  @xmath13 , and the soft - breaking parameters  @xmath14 ( real ) and  @xmath15 ( complex ) .",

    "combining the new terms with the existing one - loop result and leading two - loop terms of @xmath47 yields an improved prediction for the higgs - boson mass spectrum also for complex parameters that is equivalent in accuracy to that of the real mssm .",
