    "one of the most challenging complex system is the human brain in which neurons and their interconnections through synapses form a very complicated structure , the cortical network .",
    "the complexity of the circuitry of the nervous system of the human brain is still a big challenge to be resolved as it contains about 86 billion neurons and thousands times more synapses @xcite .",
    "neurons are linked together to perform certain tasks and cognitive functions , such as pattern recognition , function approximation , data processing , etc .",
    "it has been revealed that the cortical network is hierarchical and clustered with a complex connectivity @xcite , known as the modular organization of the brain .",
    "this demands an inherent parallel nature of brain computations @xcite .",
    "modular processors have to be sufficiently isolated and dynamically differentiated to achieve independent computations , but at the same time also globally connected to be integrated in coherent functions @xcite .",
    "a possible network description for this modular organization is that brain networks may be small - world structured @xcite with properties similar to many other complex networks @xcite .",
    "this viewpoint has been driven by the systematic finding of small - world topology in a wide range of human brain networks derived from structural @xcite and functional @xcite studies .",
    "small - world topology has also been identified in functional cortical neural networks in mammals @xcite and also in the nervous system of the nematode _ caenorhabditis elegans _",
    "( _ c.elegans _ ) soil worm @xcite .",
    "this topology seems to be relevant for brain function , as it is affected by diseases @xcite , normal ageing , and by pharmacological blockade of dopamine neurotransmission @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", enormous research has been devoted on the _",
    "c.elegans _  which has revealed its ability to learn about mechano- , chemo- and thermo - sensory stimuli @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that its neural system has the ability to distinguish between tastes , odours or any indication related to the presence or absence of food .",
    "moreover , it shows different kinds of learning behavior , including associative learning such as classical conditioning and differential classical conditioning , and non - associative forms of learning such as habituation and dishabituation @xcite .",
    "these properties , though quite `` simple '' , are reminiscent of the human brain ability to adapt to different stimuli and environments .",
    "moreover , many neurotransmitters such as glutamate , gaba , acetylcholine and dopamine are common in the human brain and the _ c.elegans _  neural network .",
    "the genome of the _ c.elegans",
    "_  is almost 30 times smaller than that of humans but still , encodes almost 22000 proteins and it is almost 35% similar to that of humans @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of the _ c.elegans _",
    "neural network may give an insight of the possible behavior of more complex systems , such as the human brain .",
    "neural networks , among other complex systems , self - organize in ways that synchronous spatiotemporal patterns can emerge .",
    "insightful findings regarding synchronization in complex networks have been reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite and , recently , synchronization in complex modular or clustered networks has been investigated in ref .",
    "it appears as the interplay between the intrinsic dynamics associated to the nodes of the network and , its topology and connecting functions @xcite .",
    "synchronization in neural networks is important for normal and various cognitive functions @xcite , but may also reflect pathological brain states @xcite .",
    "there is also increasing evidence that various types of brain diseases such as alzheimer s disease , schizophrenia and brain tumors may be associated with deviations of the network topology from the optimal small - world pattern @xcite .",
    "it has been found that burst synchronization of neural systems may be strongly influenced by many factors , such as coupling strengths and types @xcite , noise @xcite , and the existence of clusters in neural networks .",
    "over a decade ago , a very peculiar phenomenon of synchronization was reported in coupled oscillators , where a hybrid state combining both coherent and incoherent parts can spontaneously emerge @xcite , which was later termed chimera state @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , these states were first found in systems of identical oscillators coupled with a symmetric interaction function . since then , there has been increasing interest in chimera states @xcite and it has been shown that they are not limited to phase oscillators , but can also appear in a large variety of different systems including neural systems @xcite which is the focus of the present work . apart from the classical chimera states , which consist of a coherent and incoherent domain , chimeras with multiple incoherent regions @xcite , as well as amplitude chimera states @xcite and chimera death states @xcite have also been recently reported .",
    "the study of chimera states goes beyond numerical observations .",
    "experimental verification was first demonstrated in chemical @xcite and optical @xcite systems .",
    "further experiments were realized in mechanical @xcite , electronic @xcite , and electrochemical @xcite oscillator systems . until recently , it was widely assumed that identical elements and symmetric coupling topology were prerequisites for chimera states .",
    "these limitations , however , can be overcome and chimera - like states can also be found in systems with non - identical elements , or with non - regular or even global topologies ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "potential applications of chimera states in nature include bump states in neural systems @xcite and the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep in birds and dolphins @xcite , which sleep with one eye open , meaning that half of the brain is synchronized with the other half being desynchronized .",
    "this is relevant for studies of synchronization in community - based networks where only a few works have focused on this interesting phenomenon @xcite .",
    "our aim is to contribute in this direction by considering a topology based on the _ c.elegans _",
    "@xcite network , whose neurons are found , by employing a community detection algorithm @xcite , to be organized in six communities ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that neurons are connected using two types of synapses : electrical and chemical @xcite , which connect the neurons within and across the communities , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we model the neuron dynamics in terms of the hindmarsh - rose  system .",
    "our primary focus lies on the conditions for the existence of chimera - like states in this modular neural network , and at the same time on the relationship between the properties of these states with the topological characteristics of the considered network .",
    "we first study the level of synchronization within each community and of the entire network as a function of the electrical and chemical couplings . to measure synchronization",
    ", we use the kuramoto order parameter @xmath0 ( eq .  ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is bounded in the interval @xmath3 $ ] and is equal to 1 when neurons in the considered population are completely synchronized and 0 when they are totally desynchronized .",
    "note that , one actually averages @xmath4 over time to obtain the value to which the order parameter converges in a sufficiently long time interval .",
    "figures  [ fig2](a - g ) show the order parameter for each community and for the entire network , in the @xmath5 parameter space .",
    "all six communities have a region of high synchronization for low chemical and high electrical coupling , which is also reflected in the parameter space of the entire network ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](g ) ) .",
    "this is reasonable since in this case , the neurons are strongly connected within each community and at the same time the coupling between communities is weak , meaning that the different populations do not affect each other significantly . in particular , for communities 2 and 4 , this region of synchronization extends also to smaller electrical couplings .",
    "this is because these communities have the largest number of nodes and electrical links within them ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "small communities are not easily synchronizable due to the strong influence from the large ones and to the sparsity of their electrical synapses",
    ".    apart from this region which is common in all communities , there are other `` islands '' of synchronization where one or more communities achieve high values of the order parameter .",
    "prominent examples are fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and especially fig .",
    "[ fig2](f ) , where communities 3 and 6 show high synchronization levels for high chemical couplings with the rest of them and the network globally , being incoherent . for community 6 , in particular , this region",
    "is located at high values of the chemical coupling and gradually shrinks as the electrical coupling increases .",
    "this means that community 6 is dominated by the connected communities , a fact which is also clear from the size of the arrowheads directing to it in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "this effect , although weaker , is also responsible for the additional high synchronization area in the parameter space of community 3 , located at large values of both chemical and electrical couplings .",
    "another measure related to synchronization , which is very relevant in modular networks , is the metastability index @xmath2 , which measures the coherence among the communities along time .",
    "figure  [ fig2](h ) shows the parameter space for @xmath2 ( eq .  ) .",
    "it is clear that the region in which @xmath2 attains values close to zero coincides with the region where all communities are in a synchronized state .",
    "in other parts of the parameter space @xmath2 achieves higher values , indicating that the system often switches between synchronous and asynchronous states .",
    "figure  [ fig2](i ) corresponds to the parameter space for the chimera - like index ( eq .  ) .",
    "it is evident that @xmath1 achieves its highest values in the two synchronization `` islands '' of communities 3 and 6 , as well as on the border of the common synchronization region separating coherent from incoherent behavior .",
    "all of the aforementioned parameter spaces allow us to gain a complete picture of the collective behavior in our system , both in the community and global scale .    in order to highlight some characteristic patterns that emerge in our system , we select 3 points of interest on the @xmath5 parameter space , marked by letters * a * , * b * and * c*. they are chosen so that the following three cases are covered , * a * : both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are low - valued , * b * : metastability prevails , _ i.e. _ @xmath6 ( when normalized ) , and * c * : `` chimera - like '' states prevail over metastability _ i.e. _ @xmath7 ( when normalized ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the space - time plots of the membrane potential @xmath8 ( see eqs .  ) for the three points , one typical snapshot in time where each community is coloured in accordance to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and the time series of node 100 , which belongs to community 3 .",
    "the nodes in the communities are relabelled so that each community is placed next to each other .",
    "point * a * corresponds to low metastability and low chimera - like index ( see fig .  [",
    "fig2](h ) and [ fig2](i ) ) .",
    "this means that the network as a whole does not switch in time to different synchronization patterns frequently , and simultaneously , the 6 communities are , to a large extent , in synchrony with each other ( see also supplementary movie s1 ) .",
    "this is expected for the combination of high electrical and low chemical coupling and , is in agreement with the high value of the global order parameter shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](g ) .",
    "the corresponding time series exhibits spiking behavior with short quiescent periods between spike appearance ( fig .  [ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "the metastability effect for low chimera - like index is shown for point * b*. in the space - time plot of fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) this is illustrated by the rather regular spatial pattern ( due to low @xmath1 ) , which alternates in time between slow quiescent periods ( yellow - red ) and fast spiking intervals ( blue - green ) that correspond to synchronous and incoherent behaviors , respectively ( see also supplementary movie s2 ) . from the time series ,",
    "it is evident that , for these parameters , the system is in the bursting regime .",
    "point * c * corresponds to a chimera - like state , in which the metastability of the system attains low values .",
    "communities 2 and 4 are ( on average ) the most synchronized ones , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) and also verified by the corresponding high values of the order parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , ( d ) ) .",
    "this is reasonable , since these two communities are the largest ones in the network ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , ( b ) ) .",
    "the remaining communities alternate more frequently between spiking and quiescent behavior ( see also supplementary movie s3 ) .",
    "they are also perturbed by the inputs from the large communities making it harder for them to synchronize , as is also captured in the snapshot of fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "the above analysis has been carried out for other modular networks ( see supplementary information ) and the results are in qualitative agreement with those presented in this section for the _ c.elegans _  -based neural network .",
    "this agreement shows that our results do not depend on the community detection algorithm but , rather , on the interaction of the dynamics with the topology of the considered network .",
    "in this work we have quantified and compared certain measures of dynamical complexity , such as synchronization , which may underpin the `` differentiation '' in sub - domains and the `` integration '' as the system exhibits coherent behavior as a whole @xcite and , the metastability @xmath2 and chimera - like @xmath1 indices that allow for the quantification of the degree of metastability and chimera - like behavior exhibited by the system and its communities . in @xcite , various statistical quantities associated with the _ c.elegans _ neural network , such as the global clustering coefficient , the average of local clustering coefficients , the mean shortest path , the degree probability distribution function of the network and the small - worldness measure have been computed .",
    "the latter property is characterized by a relatively short minimum path length on average between all pairs of nodes , together with a high clustering coefficient .",
    "even though small - worldness captures important aspects of complex networks at the local and global scale of the structure , it does not provide information about the intermediate scale .",
    "these properties can be better described by the community structure or modularity of the network . since nodes within the same module",
    "are densely intra - connected , the number of triangles in a modular network is larger than in a random graph of the same size and degree distribution , while the existence of a few links between nodes in different modules plays the role of topological shortcuts in the small - world topology .",
    "networks characterized by this property tend to be small - world , with a high clustering coefficient and short path length with respect to random networks .    here , we modeled a neural network based on the _ c.elegans _ soil worm connectome in terms of hindmarsh - rose dynamics and divided its network into six communities employing the walktrap method .",
    "based on the numerical simulations of this system , we analyzed conditions under which coherent and incoherent neural phase synchronization emerges simultaneously among communities for certain values of the chemical and electrical couplings .",
    "we related this phenomenon to structural network characteristics , such as the number of nodes of the communities , the ratio of the number of chemical synapses connecting their nodes , the ratio of the number of chemical synapses divided by the mean degree of the target community , the absolute participation and contribution of nodes to the modular structure and finally , to participation and global hubness .",
    "we found out that none of the nodes with low participation are hubs of the network , which is characteristic of networks with well - defined communities , even though we found a significant number of nodes with intermediate participation , showing that most of the neurons share connections across several communities .",
    "we also found that the hubs of the network are among the nodes with the largest participation , extending their connections among most of the communities .",
    "all these findings clearly delineate the influence of one community on the others , and especially that of the two largest ones .",
    "the phenomenon of chimera - like states we identified here is reminiscent of classical chimeras observed in the kuramoto and other models . in our study , we showed that chimera - like states are spontaneously formed at chemical and electrical coupling values for which the chimera - like index is much higher than the metastability index and that they are driven by the largest communities , which were found to be the most influential ones .",
    "this remarkable behavior was found to be prominent in the two synchronization `` islands '' of two communities , as well as on the border of the common synchronization region separating coherent from incoherent behavior . in the supplementary information",
    ", we compared our results with those for modular networks sharing common features with that of the _ c.elegans_-based network , grouped into six erds - rnyi and small - world communities , respectively .",
    "we concluded that chimera - like states can also be found in the modular networks , suggesting that they appear to be prominent phenomena which might provide insights for the functioning of the human brain .",

    "for this purpose , we consider a _",
    "c.elegans_-based neural network @xcite , where we employ a community detection method that finds six communities . a schematic representation of this network is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . based on the detected communities",
    ", we assume that neurons within the same community are connected with electrical synapses ( black links in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) and neurons across communities with chemical synapses ( gray links in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "finally , we endow each neuron with hindmarsh - rose dynamics .    before we incorporate in the dynamics the coupling terms arising from the electrical and chemical synapses of the individual neurons , we briefly discuss the different characteristics and functionality of these types of synapses .",
    "a synapse is a junction between two neurons and serves as the means by which neurons communicate with each other .",
    "in particular , an electrical synapse ( electrical link ) is a physical connection between two neurons that allows electrons to pass through neurons by a very small gap between them .",
    "electrical synapses are bidirectional and of a local character , happening between neurons which are spatially very close .",
    "mutual coupling through these synapses promotes phase synchronization and coherence , resulting into groups of synchronized neurons .",
    "on the other hand , chemical synapses ( chemical links ) are typically unidirectional and the pre - synaptic signals are transmitted via release of neurotransmitters from the pre - synaptic neuron , which attaches to receptors at the post - synaptic neuron . depending on the neurotransmitter , a chemical synapse can either be excitatory or inhibitory .",
    "since the empirical methods used to identify the neuronal wiring in the _ c.elegans _  can not distinguish between the two types of synapses , here we consider only excitatory chemical ones @xcite .    by applying the hindmarsh - rose  dynamics to the nodes of the network that incorporates both types of synapses",
    ", we create an undirected neural network , in which neurons are connected by electrical ( linear diffusive coupling ) and chemical ( nonlinear coupling ) synapses , described by the equations , @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the neuron index , @xmath11 is the membrane potential of the @xmath12-th neuron , @xmath13 is associated with the fast current , either @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and @xmath16 with the slow current , for example @xmath17 .",

    "for these parameters , the hindmarsh - rose  model enables the spiking - bursting behavior of the membrane potential observed in experiments made with single neurons _ in vitro_. it is a relatively simple model that provides a good qualitative description of many different patterns empirically observed in neural activity .",

    "we analyze the dynamical behavior of the system of eqs .   by means of numerical simulations for a network of six small - world communities , detected in the _ c.elegans _  neural network .",

    "[ fig1](b ) , where the communities are represented by circles of sizes proportional to their number of nodes .",

    "<S> chimera states , namely the coexistence of coherent and incoherent behavior , were previously analyzed in complex networks . however , they have not been extensively studied in modular networks . here , we consider a neural network inspired by the connectome of the _ c.elegans _ soil worm , organized into six interconnected communities , where neurons obey chaotic bursting dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> neurons are assumed to be connected with electrical synapses within their communities and with chemical synapses across them . </S>",
    "<S> as our numerical simulations reveal , the coaction of these two types of coupling can shape the dynamics in such a way that chimera - like states can happen . </S>",
    "<S> they consist of a fraction of synchronized neurons which belong to the larger communities , and a fraction of desynchronized neurons which are part of smaller communities . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the kuramoto order parameter @xmath0 , we also employ other measures of coherence , such as the chimera - like @xmath1 and metastability @xmath2 indices , which quantify the degree of synchronization among communities and along time , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we perform the same analysis for networks that share common features with the _ c.elegans _ neural network . </S>",
    "<S> similar results suggest that under certain assumptions , chimera - like states are prominent phenomena in modular networks , and might provide insight for the behavior of more complex modular networks . </S>"
