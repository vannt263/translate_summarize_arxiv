    "note that the direct transition involving two dirac fermions is protected by the @xmath3 spin symmetry ; when it is broken , and there is no additional symmetry protecting @xmath177 , the direct transition will split into two transitions .",

    "the emergent @xmath9 gauge field @xmath28 is associated with the gauge redundancy @xmath209 and @xmath30 . without loss of generality ,",

    "furthermore , integrating out @xmath28 yields the response theory @xmath211 which shows that the state has hall conductance @xmath75 .",
    "therefore this state describes a biqh state , with no intrinsic topological order .    an alternative way of seeing this result , and directly deriving the effective theory ( [ biqhlag1 ] ) , is as follows .",

    "now , since @xmath218 each describe the dynamics of a band with unit chern number , the effective theory is : @xmath219 integrating out @xmath28 then gives ( [ biqhlag1 ] ) , for @xmath6 .",
    "finally , note that the case where @xmath220 also describes a biqh state , with hall conductance @xmath221 .",
    "recall the critical theory between the @xmath2 laughlin fqh state and the @xmath0 fractionalized states is described by @xmath222 in the case of the fqh transition , where the physical degrees of freedom are bosons with a conserved @xmath9 charge , the boson destruction operator at the critical point is @xmath223 , where @xmath224 removes @xmath225 units of flux of @xmath131 . due to the cs term , @xmath225 flux of @xmath131 carries 2 units of @xmath131 charge , and therefore the physical gauge - invariant operator must also remove a quanta of @xmath90 . from the coupling of the external field , we see that a @xmath225 flux of @xmath131 will carry unit charge under @xmath50 and therefore corresponds to the physical boson .",
    "@xmath90 describes double vortices , as it carries charge @xmath10 under @xmath131 .",
    "single vortices remain gapped through the transition and do not appear in the low energy theory at the critical point .",
    "now let us consider the @xmath3 invariant spin-@xmath5 system . here",
    ", the critical theory is described by ( [ cshiggsv ] ) , but without the external gauge field @xmath50 and with @xmath131 replaced by the gauge field @xmath28 to which the schwinger bosons couple .",
    "the higgs field @xmath90 itself can be physically understood as a spin singlet pair of the schwinger bosons .",
    "the single spin operators do not appear as scaling operators in the critical theory .",
    "the fact that the partons @xmath98 remain in a gapped chern insulator indicates that the triplet gap remains finite through the transition .",
    "the only scaling operators in the theory are therefore spin singlet operators .",
    "these include the gauge flux : @xmath226 .",
    "@xmath227 is proportional to the skyrmion number of @xmath228 .",
    "the other basic gauge invariant operator is @xmath229 , which physically corresponds to the operator that changes the skyrmion number by 1 .",
    "the scaling functions of these operators can be readily obtained through various large @xmath230 approximations .",
    "these were performed for @xmath9 cs - higgs theories in @xcite , where it was shown that the transitions are indeed continuous in the large @xmath230 limit .",
    "in the main text we discussed the transition between the @xmath165 csl and the @xmath0 spin liquid ( doubled semion ) . to describe the case with general @xmath1 , we start with the @xmath1 flavors of two - component schwinger bosons : @xmath231 for @xmath232 and @xmath233 , and we consider a state where one of the @xmath1 flavors transitions from the @xmath234 biqh to the charge-2 sc while the other @xmath235 flavors stay in the @xmath75 biqh state",
    ". the resulting state is described by a @xmath15 cs theory with @xmath236 , which is topologically equivalent to the toric code / doubled semion models when @xmath1 is even / odd , respectively .",
    "the wave function that interpolates through this transition , for general @xmath1 , is given by ( [ wfnpg ] ) , with @xmath237 replaced by @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the mean - field state of the fermionic partons @xmath240 and @xmath241 where @xmath241 for @xmath242 form spin singlet chern insulators with chern number @xmath10 , and @xmath243 form a chern insulator with chern number @xmath103 , while one of the @xmath244 undergoes a chern number changing transition from chern number @xmath103 to @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath245 denotes the @xmath246-vacuum .",
    "here we will briefly review the fermionization of the 3d xy transition , which was proposed in @xcite",
    ". it will be helpful to consider table [ statestable ] of the main text .",
    "notice that the chern number assignment @xmath247 for the mean - field states of @xmath31 and @xmath32 leads to a description of a topologically trivial bose mott insulator .",
    "in contrast , the case @xmath248 describes the bose superfluid .",
    "therefore , the effective theory describing the transition between a bose mott insulator and a superfluid can be understood as a chern number changing transition for @xmath32 .",
    "such a critical theory is described by the following action : @xmath249 where @xmath86 describes the mott insulator and @xmath85 describes the superfluid .",
    "since this theory descibes the mott insulator - superfluid transition in the presence of particle - hole symmetry , it is conjectured to be equivalent to the conventional 3d xy critical point : @xmath250 rescaling @xmath251 and subtracting both ( [ ferml ] ) and ( [ xyl ] ) by @xmath252 gives the duality used in the main text .",
    "in this section , we discuss in some more detail the necessity of the biqh construction of this paper , as compared with the fermionic iqh construction of @xcite , for understanding the transitions between the csl and the @xmath0 spin liquids .",
    "the construction of @xcite starts by writing the spin-1/2 operator in terms of slave fermions : @xmath253 where @xmath254 is a two - component fermion .",
    "this leads to an emergent @xmath9 gauge field @xmath28 associated with the gauge transformation @xmath255 .",
    "the csl corresponds to a state where the fermions @xmath124 form a spin singlet chern insulator with chern number @xmath256 . for @xmath6 ,",
    "this leads to a state that is equivalent to the kl - csl , while for @xmath122 , the fractional statistics of the quasiparticles are slightly different from the kl - csl , as summarized in the main text .    in order to describe a transition to a @xmath0 state , one possibility is to consider a transition where the pair field of the fermions , @xmath257 , condenses , thus breaking the @xmath9 gauge symmetry to @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to the biqh state , in the fermionic case there is no theory of a transition from a fermion iqh state that simultaneously condenses the pair field and completely destroys the edge modes .",
    "instead we can consider a scenario where the pair field condenses , but the edge modes are not destroyed . to understand the nature of the resulting state ,",
    "let us focus on the case @xmath22 .",
    "the iqh states of the fermions can be described by two @xmath9 cs gauge fields @xmath258 , @xmath259 , such that @xmath260 describes the current of @xmath261 .",
    "the effective theory is therefore : @xmath262 here , @xmath90 represents the pair field @xmath263 ; its condensation breaks the @xmath9 gauge symmetry to @xmath0 . in order to understand the topological properties of the @xmath90-condensed phase , it is helpful to perform a particle - vortex duality on @xmath90 : @xmath264 here",
    ", @xmath265 is the current of the original @xmath90 , while @xmath266 describes the vortices of @xmath90 .",
    "the phase where @xmath90 is condensed corresponds to the case where @xmath266 is uncondensed , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , when @xmath90 is condensed , @xmath266 is uncondensed and can be integrated out , leaving us with a @xmath267 cs theory with @xmath62-matrix @xmath268 this satisfies @xmath269 .",
    "however it has three positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue , implying that the system has a net chiral central charge @xmath270 , and therefore has topologically protected gapless edge states .",
    "such a state is topologically distinct from both the toric code and doubled semion models .",
    "it can be thought of as a chiral spin liquid with a discrete gauge structure , _ eg a chiral topological superconductor with @xmath271 chiral edge majorana modes coupled to a fluctuating @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "such a state can be constructed using the honeycomb kitaev model @xcite .",
    "_    while it is interesting that this `` @xmath0 csl '' also neighbors the kl - csl , it does not correspond to the two different @xmath0 spin liquids considered in the main text .",
    "it appears that the construction in terms of fermionic spinons @xcite is indeed insufficient to describe the transition between the csl and the @xmath0 spin liquids , although it does allow access to the transition to a @xmath0 csl .",
    "here we will briefly review the topological properties of abelian cs - higgs theories @xcite(see also @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "specifically , consider a @xmath272 cs term , coupled to a charge-@xmath42 higgs field : @xmath273 where @xmath89 .",
    "when @xmath90 is uncondensed this describes @xmath274 cs theory , the topological properties of which are well known @xcite : there are @xmath1 topologically distinct quasiparticles , with fractional statistics @xmath275 .    in order to understand the topological properties of the higgs phase , where @xmath90 is condensed and the gauge group @xmath9 is broken to @xmath43 , it is helpful to perform a duality transformation on @xmath90 and to consider the theory in terms of the vortices of @xmath90 .",
    "this is described by the theory @xmath276 where @xmath266 is a complex scalar describing the vortices of @xmath90 .",
    "the condensed phase of @xmath90 is therefore the uncondensed phase of @xmath266 . considering the case where @xmath266 is uncondensed ( higgs phase of ( [ csh ] ) ) , we can integrate it out to obtain a @xmath15 cs theory : @xmath277 the topological properties of such a theory can be directly read off from the @xmath62-matrix : @xmath278 it has @xmath64 distinct quasiparticles . for @xmath1 even , this describes a topological phase where the local degrees of freedom are all bosons , and otherwise the local degrees of freedom contain fermions . in general , we can perform an @xmath279 transformation @xmath280 , with @xmath281 , which keeps the topological properties of @xmath62 invariant , such that @xmath282 therefore , the case where @xmath1 is a multiple of @xmath283 leads to @xmath284 , which encodes the topological properties of ordinary @xmath43 gauge theory .    when @xmath1 is even , the above can be viewed as a generalized version of @xmath43 gauge theory that corresponds to one of the @xmath42 different kinds of @xmath43 gauge theory found in @xcite . the case @xmath285 describes the doubled - semion model discussed in the main text ."

    "<S> there are @xmath42 topologically distinct bosonic spt states with @xmath43 symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> the description of the conventional magnetically ordered or valence bond solid ( vbs ) states in terms of schwinger bosons ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath75 biqh state then leads , at long wavelengths , to the effective theory @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the current of @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> this theory has @xmath119 topologically distinct quasiparticle excitations with fractional statistics @xmath120 , and therefore is topologically equivalent to the original kl - csl . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the fermionic spinon construction of @xcite , where the fractional statistics are given by @xmath121 , has a _ different topological order when @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for all @xmath1 the construction we have presented is in the same universality class as the state originally proposed by kl , but not to the state proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that @xcite starts with a construction of fermionic spinons , @xmath123 , and considers a mean - field state where the fermionic spinons @xmath124 form a @xmath125 _ fermionic iqh state , leading to the extra shifts of @xmath126 in @xmath127 . within this mean - field theory </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to understand the continuous transition to the @xmath0 spin liquid , which necessitates the construction of this paper ( see appendix [ slavefermapp ] ) . _ </S>",
    "<S> _    the above construction suggests that the wave function for the csl can be obtained from the gutzwiller projection of the biqh state of @xmath48 onto the physical hilbert space of one particle per site : @xmath128 is the mean - field state describing the biqh state of @xmath48 , and @xmath129 is the gutzwiller projection . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wfnpg ] ) is in general different from the wave functions proposed originally @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the vortices of a bose superfluid can be described in terms of a bosonic field @xmath130 coupled to a non - compact gauge field @xmath131 , where the particle current is @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the vortices see the original particles as a magnetic field . </S>",

    "<S> when the vortices form the biqh state , described by the effective theory ( [ biqhlag1 ] ) , we obtain a @xmath138 cs gauge theory described by a @xmath62-matrix @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> this satisfies @xmath140 , and the fractional statistics of the quasiparticles coincide with those of the @xmath2 laughlin state . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen more directly by integrating out @xmath141 and @xmath142 to obtain @xmath143 , which is the more conventional theory of the @xmath2 laughlin fqh state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows that when the vortices form either the biqh state , a trivial mott insulator , or a superfluid , then the original bosons form either the laughlin fqh state , the superfluid , or the trivial mott insulator , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> let us turn to wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> a simple trial wave function for a single vortex in a continuum bosonic superfluid takes the form @xcite : @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the complex coordinate of the @xmath146th boson , @xmath147 is the complex coordinate of the vortex , and @xmath148 is a real function that allows for the relaxation of the particle density profile of the vortex in the interacting superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state wave function @xmath149 of the interacting superfluid is usually considered to take the jastrow form @xmath150 , for a suitable real function @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the many - body boson wave function for a state where the vortices have formed a biqh state may be described by the following ansatz : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the biqh wave function for particles with complex coordinates @xmath154 , and @xmath155 is the natural generalization of @xmath156 to a state with many well - separated vortices . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vortexfqhwfn ] ) and its connection to the effective field theory studied here is reminiscent of the standard fqh hierarchy construction @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> when the schwinger bosons form the charge-@xmath10 sc described above , then the arguments given previously imply that the resulting spin liquid is topologically equivalent to the `` doubled semion '' model . </S>",

    "<S> a wave function that interpolates through the transition can be written by using ( [ wfnpg ] ) , and with @xmath157 replaced by the spinful wave function of the biqh to charge-2 sc transition described above . </S>",
    "<S> the generalization to @xmath122 is given in appendix [ generaln ] . </S>",

    "<S> more details about the physical operators at the critical point are discussed in appendix [ physicalops ] . _    </S>",
    "<S> a possible microscopic hamiltonian that may tune through this transition is the following @xmath3 symmetric spin-@xmath5 model on the kagome lattice : @xmath158 where @xmath159 with the sum over the triangles of the kagome lattice , with @xmath160 ordered clockwise around the vertices of the triangles , and @xmath161 @xcite . </S>",
