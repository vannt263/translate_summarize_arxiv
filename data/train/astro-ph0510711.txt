    "one of the interesting observational discoveries of the last decade is that several diatomic molecules in the `` quiet '' regions of the solar photosphere , such as mgh , @xmath0 and cn , show conspicuous scattering polarization signals when observing close to the edge of the solar disk ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "of particular interest is the fact , reported by @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) , that the molecular scattering polarization amplitudes at a given distance from the solar limb appear to be both spatially invariant and independent of the solar magnetic activity cycle , in sharp contrast with the behavior of many strong atomic lines .    for us ,",
    "this was indeed a truly puzzling behavior because , as pointed out by @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) during the third international workshop on solar polarization , the sensitivity of molecular lines to the hanle effect should actually be similar to that of atomic lines .",
    "it is true that the land factors ( @xmath1 ) of the molecular line levels are typically much smaller than those of atomic lines ( @xcite @xcite ) , but this does not imply at all that molecular lines are `` immune '' to the hanle effect because one has to take into account that the radiative lifetimes ( @xmath2 ) of molecular levels are generally larger than those of atomic lines . consequently , the critical hanle field strength , @xmath3 , is similar for both atomic and molecular lines is the field strength that is sufficient to produce a significant change in the line s scattering polarization amplitude when the excitation of the atomic or molecular system is dominated by radiative transitions . if collisions are also efficient then the critical hanle field increases due to collisional quenching . ]",
    "( e.g. , @xmath4 g for the sr i 4607   line and @xmath5 g for the 5175.38   line of mgh ) .",
    "the resolution of that puzzling behavior was found when it was pointed out ( @xcite @xcite ) that the observed scattering polarization in very weak spectral lines , such as those of molecules , is coming _ mainly _ from the upflowing regions of the `` quiet '' solar photosphere ( see fig . 2 of trujillo bueno et al .",
    "according to atomic physics , the scattering polarization in molecular lines is indeed sensitive to the hanle effect .",
    "what happens in the sun is that the probability density function ( pdf ) that describes the distribution of magnetic fields in the ( granular ) upflowing regions is dominated by very weak fields , so that the magnetic fields that could in principle produce a _ substantial _ hanle depolarization have a very small filling factor ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , if we assume that the shape of that pdf is an exponential we then find @xmath6 g when applying the hanle effect line ratio technique for c@xmath7 lines reported by @xcite ( @xcite ) , which corresponds to @xmath8 g for the simpler case of a single valued field ( @xcite @xcite ) lines that are thought to be more sensitive to the weaker fields .",
    "the value @xmath6 g that they reported _ for the single valued microturbulent field case _ is an overestimation , given that their analysis is in error by a factor of 2 because c@xmath7 does not have @xmath9-doubling .",
    "this fact has been independently noticed by those authors . ] .    the main purpose of this letter is to report on the very interesting finding summarized in the abstract .",
    "as shown below , our theoretical investigation is based on three - dimensional ( 3d ) radiative transfer modeling of the scattering polarization in each of the 37 unblended mgh lines that show significant linear polarization amplitudes in @xcite s ( @xcite ) atlas of the linearly - polarized solar limb spectrum .",
    "we have solved the 3d scattering polarization problem in each unblended mgh line in a way similar to that pursued by @xcite ( @xcite ) for the sr i 4607   line case that is , by using a realistic 3d model of the solar photosphere resulting from asplund s et al .",
    "( 2000 ) hydrodynamical simulations of solar surface convection .",
    "the mgh lines that produce scattering polarization signals in the sun are located around 5100   and they result from @xmath10 ( q - branch ) transitions between the rotational @xmath11-levels of the @xmath12 vibrational level of the excited electronic state , @xmath13 , and the @xmath14-levels of the @xmath15 level of the ground electronic state , @xmath16 .",
    "the separation between adjacent @xmath17-levels within each vibrational level is of the order of @xmath18 s@xmath19 , which is a few orders of magnitude larger than the level s natural width .",
    "it follows that in the absence of magnetic fields quantum interferences between such @xmath17 levels can be neglected , which is expected to be a suitable approximation at least up to the magnetic field strength that establishes the transition to the paschen - back regime for the very first @xmath14 levels ( i.e. , at least up to @xmath20 g according to @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the land factors we have used are the exact ones , which for the upper levels correspond to the intermediate coupling scheme between hund s cases ( a ) and ( b ) , while for the lower levels to hund s case ( b ) .",
    "interestingly , because for mgh lines with @xmath21 the land factor @xmath22 , we have that the hanle field @xmath23 .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath24 g for the @xmath25 line , while it is @xmath26 g for the @xmath27 line .",
    "it is of interest to point out that , in principle , this differential sensitivity to the hanle effect may be modified due to the possibility of a dependence with @xmath17 of the collisional rates .",
    "we will address this differential collisional quenching issue in more detail in a forthcoming publication .",
    "although we have solved the radiative transfer equations numerically in the chosen 3d photospheric model , it is useful to note that for the limiting case of a tangential observation in a plane - parallel atmosphere the emergent fractional linear polarization is approximately given by    @xmath28,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the fractional alignment of the @xmath17-level ( being @xmath30 and @xmath31 the multipolar components of the density matrix corresponding to the @xmath17-level , so that @xmath30 is proportional to the overall population of the @xmath17-level while @xmath31 is non - zero if the population of substates with different values of @xmath32 are different ) . the rest of the symbols in eq .",
    "( 1 ) have their usual meaning ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we have calculated the number density of mgh molecules at each grid point of the 3d photospheric model by applying the instantaneous chemical equilibrium approximation , which is a reliable one in the solar photosphere ( @xcite @xcite ) . moreover , a two - level molecular model for each particular line transition is a good approximation for calculating @xmath33 , for both @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "it is clarifying to note that the fractional polarization of each @xmath17-level is approximately given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the degree of anisotropy of the radiation field at the line s frequency ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) , while @xmath38 ( being @xmath39 the total angular momentum of the lower level `` @xmath40 '' if @xmath17 is that of the upper level `` @xmath41 '' , and viceversa ) accounts for the joined depolarizing action of collisions and of the assumed microturbulent field .",
    "if the ground level is assumed to be unpolarized ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) , then the relevant statistical equilibrium equations for the microturbulent field case are those derived by @xcite ( @xcite ) , which give    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the hanle depolarization factor , @xmath45 quantifies the upper - level rate of elastic ( depolarizing ) collisions in units of the inverse of the upper - level s lifetime , and @xmath46 is the probability that a de - excitation event is caused by inelastic collisions .    for the general case in which we have population imbalances in both levels",
    "the problem is much more complicated because it requires solving jointly the rate equation for each @xmath47 multipolar component of the lower and upper levels assuming statistical steady state and the stokes - vector transfer equations ( see @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , it can be shown that under the weak anisotropy limit approximation discussed by @xcite ( @xcite ) a relationship similar to that of eq .",
    "( 2 ) holds for each @xmath17-level ( i.e. , for both @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , although with considerably more involved expressions for @xmath38 .",
    "here we investigate which combinations of field strengths and collisional rates produce polarization amplitudes in agreement with @xcite s ( @xcite ) observations . for simplicity in the presentation , the selected calculations below correspond to the case in which the same elastic collisional rate is assumed for both the upper and lower levels ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) . as will be shown below in fig .",
    "4 , we have done this exercise for each of the 37 unblended mgh lines that show measurable @xmath49 signals , whose @xmath17-values span from 6.5 to 37.5 . however , we show first details of our calculations for a representative mgh line : the q@xmath50 line at 5175.3867  , whose einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission is @xmath51 s@xmath19 ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "firstly , we consider the _ collisionless _ case in which we have only varied the strength of the microturbulent magnetic field , which is assumed to have the same value at all the grid - points of the 3d atmospheric model . figure [ fig_qi_field ] shows that magnetic depolarization alone is not sufficient to explain the observed scattering polarization amplitude .",
    "secondly , we consider the case in which only the rate of elastic collisions is increased , while both inelastic collisions and magnetic fields are disregarded .",
    "figure [ fig_qi_delta ] shows that the collisional depolarization rate needed for obtaining a @xmath49 value compatible with @xcite s ( @xcite ) observations is @xmath52 .",
    "this is an order - of - magnitude greater than the @xmath53-value reported by mohan rao & rangarajan ( 1999 ) for the @xmath545165.933 line , which they obtained via a simplistic 1d modeling approach .      the solid line of fig .",
    "[ fig_qi_field_collis ] shows the magnetic field sensitivity of the spatially averaged @xmath49 calculated assuming @xmath55 that is , using the elastic collisional rate value that in the absence of magnetic fields fits the @xmath49 amplitude observed in the 5175.38   mgh line .",
    "the important point to remember is that in this collisionally dominated case a good agreement with the observed scattering polarization amplitude is found only if the assumed microturbulent field is weaker than about 10 g.    the dashed line of fig .",
    "[ fig_qi_field_collis ] shows what happens when we do the same numerical experiment but using instead @xmath56 that is , the elastic collisional rate that in the presence of a sufficiently strong microturbulent field ( so as to produce complete hanle saturation in both levels of the 5175.38   mgh line ) fits the observed @xmath49 amplitude .",
    "the main point we want to highlight now is that in this weakly collisional case the minimum strength of the microturbulent field needed to fit the observed polarization amplitude must be _ at least _",
    "@xmath57100 g. in our opinion , this represents an unrealistically high value for the strength of the microturbulent field in the ( granular ) upflowing regions .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig_chisq ] is the most conclusive figure of this letter , since it summarizes the information we have obtained from the analysis we have carried out for _ all _ the unblended mgh lines that show sizable @xmath49 amplitudes in @xcite s ( @xcite ) atlas . for each pair of collisional rate ( @xmath58 ) and of the microturbulent magnetic field strength ( @xmath59 ) ,",
    "the figure shows the value of the well - known @xmath60 least - squares function . as expected from the analysis we have done separately for each mgh line ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_qi_field_collis ] ) we find that ( essentially ) the following two possibilities lead to an equally good _ best fit _ to the observed linear polarization amplitudes in _ all _ the unblended mgh lines simultaneously : ( 1 ) a collisionally dominated case characterized by @xmath61 and with the possibility of having a weak microturbulent field whose strength can not be sensibly larger than 10 g ( concerning the case of a volume - filling and single valued tangled field ) and ( 2 ) a strongly magnetized case characterized by a microturbulent field of strength greater than a few hundred gauss , which nevertheless requires the presence of elastic collisions with @xmath62 for fitting the observations .",
    "however , similar results are obtained for @xmath63 , and it is very unlikely that the inelastic collisional rates of the mgh lines ( which result from electronic transitions whose @xmath64s@xmath19 ) are so important to give @xmath65 . in any case , the only significant difference for @xmath66 lies in the strongly magnetized solution , which turns out to be characterized by even smaller @xmath53-values . ] .",
    "we have shown that in the `` quiet '' regions of the solar photosphere collisions seem to be very efficient in depolarizing the rotational levels of mgh lines .",
    "if the inferred depolarization is fully due to elastic collisions , then a single valued microturbulent field of strength sensibly larger than 10 g filling the whole upflowing volume of the solar photosphere would be incompatible with the observations .",
    "this constraint for the strength of the hidden field in the ( granular ) upflowing regions of the quiet solar photosphere is very gratifying since it is in agreement with our result that the differential hanle effect in the c@xmath7 lines of the swan system implies the presence of very weak fields , with @xmath67 g ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite ( @xcite ) a volume filling microturbulent field of 10 g is too weak for explaining the inferred depolarization in the ( moderately strong ) sr i 4607   line , whose calculated scattering polarization amplitude in the absence of magnetic fields turns out to have significant contributions from both the upflowing and downflowing regions .",
    "actually , when no distinction is made between such regions , the hanle effect in the strontium line implies @xmath68 g for the case of a single valued microturbulent field , or @xmath69 g for the more realistic case of an exponential distribution of field strengths .",
    "trujillo bueno s et al . (",
    "2004 ) resolution of this apparent contradiction is that the strength of the hidden field fluctuates at the spatial scales of the solar granulation pattern , with much stronger fields above the intergranular regions .",
    "the above - mentioned constraint , obtained from our analysis of the scattering polarization in mgh lines , reinforces our previously reported conclusion that there is a vast amount of hidden magnetic energy and ( unsigned ) magnetic flux in the inter - network regions of the ` quiet ' solar photosphere , carried mainly by rather chaotic fields in the ( intergranular ) downflowing plasma with strengths between the equipartition field values and @xmath70 kg ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we remark that in this letter we have also shown that an equally good theoretical fit to the linear polarization amplitudes observed in mgh lines can be achieved by assuming that the rate of depolarizing collisions is an order of magnitude smaller than in the previously mentioned collisionally dominated case , but then the required strength of the hidden field in the ( granular ) upflowing regions turns out to be unrealistically high . in either case , we find that magnetic fields alone are not sufficient to explain the observed scattering polarization amplitudes in mgh lines .",
    "we are currently investigating whether the inferred collisional depolarization is mainly due to transitions between the zeeman sublevels of each @xmath17 level , as we have assumed here for simplicity , or to collisional transitions between different @xmath17 levels pertaining to the same vibrational and electronic state .",
