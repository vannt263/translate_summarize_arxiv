    "geometrically frustrated quantum magnets above one dimension ( 1d ) have attracted strong interest in recent years @xcite . from an experimental point of view",
    "this is due in part to the discovery of materials like the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin - dimer system srcu@xmath1(bo@xmath2)@xmath1 @xcite and the three - dimensional ( 3d ) tetrahedral compounds cu@xmath1te@xmath1o@xmath3x@xmath1 with x = cl , br @xcite which exhibit strong frustration of the magnetic exchange . from a theoretical point of view , the prime interest in such systems stems from the possibility of realizing quantum disordered states and spin liquid behavior .",
    "particularly promising candidates in this direction are systems which comprise tetrahedra coupled into 2d or 3d networks . indeed ,",
    "experimental observations on pyrochlore materials , like csnicrf@xmath4 @xcite or tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath5 @xcite suggest the possibility of liquid - like behavior .",
    "in contrast to the latter systems , which are essentially classical due to ising anisotropy and spins larger than 1/2 , the @xmath6 invariant spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the 3d pyrochlore lattice is an open issue .",
    "experiments on the @xmath7 system y@xmath1ir@xmath1o@xmath5 @xcite seem to indicate the presence of quantum spin liquid state .",
    "moments are located on solid circles . crossed dimers at site @xmath8 ( bold solid lines ) are locally coupled via @xmath9 ( dashed lines ) and non - locally coupled to nearest neighbors dimer by @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( doted lines ) . on dimer exchange @xmath11 will be set to unity hereafter.,width=234 ]    to reduce the complexity of the 3d system , a 2d projection , i.e. the planar pyrochlore , also known as checkerboard or crossed chain model ( ccm ) , which is shown in fig.[cdm - lattice ] for @xmath12 , has been considered as a simplified starting point .",
    "the ccm model and some of its anisotropic generalizations have been studied by employing a variety of techniques .",
    "analytic methods include semiclassical @xmath13 analysis @xcite , large - n limit of the sp(n ) model @xcite , series expansion ( se ) by unitary transformation @xcite and quantum field theory ( qft ) methods @xcite .",
    "besides , this model has been studied extensively by means of exact diagonalization ( ed ) techniques @xcite .",
    "these investigations have given a fairly complete picture of the phases of the system at different sectors of parameters space .",
    "at the checkerboard point ( @xmath12 ) a valence bond crystal ( vbc ) ground state with a spin gap has been found @xcite . for @xmath14 model of fig.[cdm - lattice ] tends to the 2d spin@xmath0 heisenberg model on the square lattice , which is known to have gapless magnon excitations and afm - lro . from this limit , by means of a phenomenological approach within the framework of the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory , it has been suggested recently that the transition between the ( afm - lro ) phase and the vbc , as @xmath15 are increased , could happen within a coexistence region or by a first order transition @xcite but this point deserves more investigation .",
    "previous results from ed up to 36 spins for @xmath16 in ref.@xcite predict a finite gap at @xmath17 and an extrapolated closure of the gap at @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , semiclassical approaches predict stability of the afm - lro phase , in the case of @xmath7 at @xmath16 for @xmath19 .    in the opposite limit of weakly coupled spin@xmath0 chains , i.e. @xmath20 in fig.[cdm - lattice ] ,",
    "there are controversial results .",
    "on the one hand , previous findings based on qft methods @xcite suggested that the model exhibits a 2d spin liquid ground state , being an example of the so called _ sliding luttinger liquid _ ( sll ) which is characterized by the absence of lro and the elementary excitations being massless , deconfined spinons .",
    "it has been suggested that the prime reason for this behavior stems from the momentum dependence of the completely frustrated inter chain coupling .",
    "the latter vanishes exactly at the afm nesting vector , suppressing a conventional magnetic instability .",
    "these results were corroborated subsequently by numerical studies @xcite , where a range @xmath21 $ ] for the extension of an effective 1d behavior was suggested .",
    "on the other hand , by employing bosonization and renormalization group methods , starykh et al .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested that instead of exhibiting a sll phase , the model of fig.[cdm - lattice ] enters a gapped _ crossed dimer _",
    "phase for @xmath20 , with a spin gap @xmath22 which opens according to @xmath23 .",
    "in this situation it is desirable to obtain results from complementary methods , which will be the primary goal of this work .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis we will employ a se in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 as in fig.[cdm - lattice ] and will evaluate the ground state energy and the elementary excitations .",
    "our findings will support the existence of a crossed dimer phase , in agreement with the results of ref.@xcite .    to perform a se , applicable in the vicinity of the anticipated sll phase we decompose the planar pyrochlore lattice into a set of crossed , _",
    "dimerized _ chains as shown in fig.[cdm - lattice ] .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from eq.([h0 ] ) it is clear that each state of @xmath26 can be labelled by the following quantum numbers : total spin @xmath32 , the spin of the dimer on the positive(negative ) diagonal , i.e. the @xmath36 and the energy @xmath35 .",
    "as one can observe , for @xmath37 the ground state is @xmath38 , i.e. both dimers are singlets .",
    "besides , for @xmath39 the first excited states are @xmath40 i.e. one of the dimers on the positive(negative ) diagonal is a triplet while the one on the other diagonal is a singlet .",
    "the other states are : a total spin singlet @xmath41 , a triplet @xmath42 and a quintet @xmath43 , all of them consisting of triplets on both diagonals .",
    "only the energies of the latter three states depend on @xmath9 .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the se expansion in terms of @xmath44 . to this end",
    "we rewrite eq.([h ] ) as @xmath45 @xmath46 has an equidistant ladder spectrum ( table [ tableh0 ] ) which we label with the _ total particle - number _ operator : @xmath47 . the _ vacuum",

    "we refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "the main advantage of the flow equation method is that unlike @xmath65 , the effective hamiltonian @xmath66 is constructed to _ conserve _ the total number of particles @xmath67 of @xmath46 at each order in the expansion .",
    "this allows for the se of several quantities from the bare eigenstates of @xmath46 as we show in the following sections .",
    "the ground state energy allows for an important consistency check of our calculation with respect to existing literature and other se results . as mentioned above",
    ", there is evidence for a _ quadrumer _ vbc phase of the ccm at the checkerboard point ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this is based on ed @xcite and se starting from the quadrumer limit of the ccm @xcite . moreover , starykh et al .",
    "@xcite , have predicted a first order transition or a coexistence phase at some intermediate value of @xmath69 and @xmath70 between the vbc and a crossed dimer phase .",
    "therefore , in order for the present se to give results consistent with them for @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the vicinity of the checkerboard point , we expect the ground state energy of the crossed dimer state to be larger than that of the quadrumer vbc at @xmath68 .    for @xmath37",

    "the ground state energy per spin and pbc , @xmath78 , is given by @xmath79 as a check , note that @xmath80 reduces to the @xmath81 dimer expansion of the ground state energy of the dimerized spin@xmath0 chain @xcite .",
    "from bethe ansatz @xcite the ground state energy for the homogeneous spin@xmath0 chain is known : @xmath82 @xcite . comparing it with @xmath83 from eq.([egccm ] )",
    "we obtain a relative error of @xmath84 , which gives a rough estimation of the convergence @xcite .",
    "fig.[eg - plot ] depicts the evolution of the ground state energy as given by eq.([egccm ] ) vs @xmath10 for different values of @xmath9 .",
    "as shown , @xmath78 monotonously decreases as @xmath9 is incremented from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , for fixed values of @xmath10 .",
    "the position @xmath87 of the maximum of @xmath78 vs @xmath10 shifts from @xmath88 to @xmath89 for @xmath9 taking fixed values from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , respectively .    at the checkerboard point",
    "our se yields @xmath90 .",
    "note that our value is larger than the value of @xmath91 which has been obtained from the quadrumer se in ref.@xcite . while the expansion parameters and their respective orders can not be compared directly between the present se and that of ref.@xcite these findings are at least consistent with the stability of the quadrumer vbc in the vicinity of the checkerboard point .",
    "this , together with the fact that @xmath92 has a degenerated ground state ( see table 1 ) , suggests that eq.([egccm ] ) , at least at the checkerboard point , does not represent the ground state energy of the system anymore , which is @xmath91 .",
    "next we evaluate the dispersion of the one - triplet states . to this end",

    "we have calculated the triplet dispersion @xmath115 up to @xmath77 @xcite . upon rotating @xmath116 along the positive and negative diagonals , by means of @xmath117 , the two branches of eq.([disp - eq ] )",
    "have to reduce to the triplet dispersion of the dimerized spin@xmath0 chains along positive and negative diagonals for @xmath118 . for consistency",
    ", we have checked that this is satisfied up to the order of our se by comparing with existing se results on the single dimerized chain @xcite .",
    "using the results from the previous section we may now turn to one of the main objectives of this work , i.e. to study the evolution of the triplet gap under the combined effect of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this will enable us to conclude on the stability of the dimerization along the chains and therefore to discriminate between the controversial proposals on the stability of the sll .",
    "the triplet gap : @xmath119 is obtained from the minimum in @xmath120-space of the two one - triplet branches . for @xmath121",
    "we find the triplet gap to be at @xmath122 .",
    "it is given by @xmath123    we have analyzed @xmath124 both by its plain se and by using a biased - pad approximation@xcite .",
    "the latter consists of an extrapolation biased by the known analytical form of the gap - closure of the dimerized spin@xmath0 chain as a function of @xmath10 @xcite , i.e. @xmath125 . using this ,",
    "@xmath10 is replaced in favor of @xmath126 in eq.([ccm - gap ] ) . then , standard pad approximation@xcite is performed around @xmath127 and finally @xmath128 is re - inserted , arriving at a transformed pad approximation in terms of the original variable @xmath10 .",
    "fig.[gap - jd ] depicts the evolution of @xmath124 as a function of @xmath10 for different values of @xmath9 .",
    "solid lines show the results from the plain series , i.e. eq.([ccm - gap ] ) and dashed lines exhibit the biased - pad(2,2 ) approximants .",
    "as the inset of fig.[gap - jd ] shows , the approximant describes the closure of the gap at @xmath129 very well .",
    "this justifies the use of this extrapolation technique and shows that our expansion can be employed to analyze the coupling of the spin@xmath0 chains via @xmath9 .",
    "as a first result from fig.[gap - jd ] , both the plain series and the biased - pad clearly show an _ opening _ of the gap at @xmath70 for increasing values of @xmath9 .",
    "as it is also obvious from these plots , this tendency persists for all @xmath130 .",
    "second , fig.[gap - jd ] shows , that the biased pad approximant leads to observable differences from the plain se only in the vicinity of the gap - closure .",
    "now , we consider the opening of the spin gap at @xmath131 for @xmath132 . to this end",
    ", we first shift the zero of energy in order to suppress the finite gap of the se at @xmath9=0 and @xmath10=1 , i.e. we consider @xmath133 . by this",
    "we account for the inability of the se to provide for a truly gapless spectrum in the limit of decoupled afm heisenberg chains . as it is obvious from fig.[gap - jd ] , this shift is very small for the biased pad , i.e. @xmath134 and @xmath135 for the plain se .",
    "the resulting spin gap versus @xmath9 is shown in fig.[gap - jp ] where the solid line represents the plain series and the dashed line corresponds to the biased - pad(2,2 ) approximant .",
    "these results may be compared with recent findings of starykh et al .",
    "@xcite . using qft methods , i.e. renormalization group and bosonization ,",
    "they have obtained an analytic expression for the spin gap , which is quadratic in @xmath9 , namely @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",
    "this function is shown in the same fig.[gap - jp ] with a dash - dotted line .",
    "obviously , there is a very good agreement up to @xmath138 .",
    "this is remarkable , given the completely different nature of our approach and that of ref.@xcite .",
    "we note that the same agreement is found when we employ standard dlog - pad approximants instead of biased - pad .",
    "therefore , we are strongly tempted to claim that the stable phase of the ccm at finite @xmath9 and at @xmath131 is indeed gapped .",
    "this is inconsistent with a sll state .",
    "while fig.[gap - jp ] seems to suggest an ever - increasing spin gap , one has to remember , that at @xmath139 the nature of the first excited state of @xmath140 changes from the triplet @xmath141 to the singlet @xmath142 ( table 1 ) .",
    "this imposes an upper limit on the range of validity of the se .",
    "in summary , using series expansion , we have studied the zero temperature properties of the planar pyrochlore quantum magnet focussing on its behavior close to the crossed chain limit . in particular",
    ", we have considered the ground state energy , the elementary triplet dispersion and the spin gap .    in relation with the ground state energy calculations our findings are consistent with previous results regarding the stability of the quadrumer vbc at the checkerboard point .",
    "our main result regards the existence of crossed dimer phase .",
    "our calculations univocally show an opening of the gap @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , our expansion ( eq.([ccm - gap ] ) ) , allows to route the physical origin of the crossed dimer phase by showing that it is adiabatically connected with decoupled crossed dimer units .    on the other hand , the very good agreement with a recent field theory approach by starykh et.al .",
    "@xcite even for @xmath144 consolidates the hypothesis about the existence of a crossed dimer phase in the region of parameters space @xmath131 , @xmath145 and indicates the absence of luttinger liquid behavior , the so called sliding luttinger liquid phase , in this region of parameters space .",
