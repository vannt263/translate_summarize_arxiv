    "several space missions , for example the esa astrometric satellite gaia @xcite , are planned to measure the position and motion of stars in the milky way with very high accuracy , in the near future .",
    "together with ground - based radial velocity experiments , e.g. rave@xcite , these surveys will provide full phase space information .",
    "accurate six dimensional phase space information of milky way stars will provide observational information of the tidal tail and hence the formation history of the milky way .",
    "the time is ripe to carry out a detailed theoretical study of satellite galaxy disruption and the induced tidal tail morphology .    in this study",
    "we perform numerical simulations of satellite galaxy disruption and its induced tidal tail morphology within the cdm cosmogony .",
    "the objective of this study is to understand the physical processes responsible for satellite galaxy disruption rather than reproducing the evolutionary history of any individual milky way satellite galaxy .",
    "in particular , satellite disruption in n - body simulations is produced by escaping satellite particles .",
    "in addition , the gravitational shock , which is caused by the slowly varying host halo potential as the satellite goes through its orbit , changes the satellite s internal structure . an initially stable satellite galaxy and accurate numerical integration of a satellite particle s orbit",
    "are necessary to represent these physical processes correctly .",
    "we investigate satellite galaxy evolution by performing high resolution and low noise n - body simulations with such stable initial conditions .",
    "in addition , we can estimate any trends of satellite tidal tail morphology with satellite properties from our simulations , even though we do not reproduce the evolutionary history of any specific milky way satellite .",
    "our simulation results show that the gravity of the satellite alters the location of the tidal tails relative to the satellite orbit .",
    "the satellite decelerates ( accelerates ) the leading ( trailing ) tail beyond the tidal radius , which is proportional to the satellite mass . for more massive satellites , this results in the leading tail being located well inside and the trailing tail being located well outside of the satellites orbit , rather than tracking the original satellite orbit @xcite .",
    "since the satellite torques the tidal tail , the distribution of the tidal tail in the observational plane is rather different from predictions that exclude such satellite torquing .",
    "in addition , the simulations provide six - dimensional phase - space information of the tidal tail to compare with upcoming astrometric measurements .    in section , [",

    ".initial properties of the three satellite models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the initial conditions of our simulations are motivated by the cdm cosmology .",
    "cdm cosmological simulations suggest that dark matter halos have a universal density profile ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a scale length characterised by the concentration parameter @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the virial radius of the halo . although there are some disagreements regarding the accuracy of this simple formula in describing halos in numerical simulations and in comparisons with observed galaxies , it remains the accepted cdm halo density profile and we adopt it for our study .",
    "we represent the host halo by a static nfw halo potential .",
    "hence our simulations ignore the effects of dynamical friction and the subsequent reaction of the host halo .",
    "obviously this is not realistic but since the satellite masses of interest are often much smaller than the host halo mass , the consequences are minor . moreover ,",
    "the prime motivation of this study is to understand the physical processes responsible for satellite disruption and tidal tail formation and not the evolutionary history of the satellite .",
    "dynamical friction is not vital to understand these processes .    , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "]    before tidal truncation , the satellites have an nfw density profile .",
    "however , the nfw profile extends to infinity and real astronomical systems have a finite size .",
    "the conventional solution limits the size of an isolated dark matter halo to its virial radius @xcite .",
    "the host halo s tidal field then determines the size of satellite halo .",
    "the host halo s tidal field affects a satellite halo even before the satellite halo passes within the host halo s virial radius . as a result , it is computationally expensive to simulate the entire evolution of a satellite",
    ". remember , the objective of our study is to understand the physical processes responsible for tidal tail formation not the reproduction of a particular tail feature .",
    "therefore , we place the satellite in the host halo on the desired orbit to start and include the host halo s tidal field when we generate a satellite s initial phase - space distribution .",
    "it is natural to characterise the tidal length scale in the satellite by the radius of the x - point that this satellite would have at some fiducial galactocentric radius in its orbit .",
    "we call this fiducial radius the _ tidal distance_. in other words , the satellite on a circular orbit at the tidal distance would have the x - point @xmath9 . at this point",
    ", the gravitational force from the satellite exactly balances the gravitational force from the host halo and non - inertial centrifugal force .",
    "the details of the iterative procedure that we use to generate the satellite s initial condition is as follows .",
    "first , we truncate the virial radius limited nfw satellite halo at the x - point radius , @xmath9 , using the error function , @xmath10\\}$ ] .",
    "we then compute the distribution function using eddington inversion and calculate a new satellite density profile by integrating the distribution function over velocity .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 in the error function truncation formula is increased from zero until a smooth phase - distribution function results .",
    "we iterate these steps until the density  distribution - function pair is converged .",
    "figure [ fig : procedure ] shows an example of how this procedure modifies an initial satellite halo . at the conclusion of the procedure , the effective tidal radius is approximately 75% of the initial x - point radius radius .",
    "we characterise a satellite halo by its _ initial _ maximum circular velocity ; figure [ fig : procedure ] demonstrates that this velocity is only weakly affected by the truncation procedure .",
    "we denote the outer radius of the satellite after the truncation procedure as the _ effective tidal radius_. it is smaller than @xmath9 owing to the truncation with the error function and the eddington inversion process",
    ". finally , we use an acceptance - rejection algorithm to generate each particle halo realization .",
    "the satellite is made up @xmath12 particles .",
    "since the initial satellites are already truncated , satellite particles are ejected only through interactions with the host halo during the simulation .",
    "we simulate a set of satellite realizations with the same tidal distance but different initial maximum rotation velocities .",
    "we investigate the effects of a satellite s size and orbit on its tidal tail morphology by varying them separately but keeping the other parameters fixed . in detail , we choose a @xmath13 nfw model for both the host halo potential and for the satellites .",
    "we generate three different size satellites , which we refer to as the massive satellite , the low - mass satellite , and the tiny - mass satellite .",
    "we use the maximum rotation velocity , @xmath14 , as a measure of satellite size since the continuous mass loss makes mass an inexact measure .",
    "we use a @xmath14 of 0.45 , 0.16 , and 0.08 times @xmath15 for the massive , low - mass , and tiny satellite , respectively . the tidal distance for all three satellites",
    "is @xmath16 .",
    "we also set the galactocentric orbital radius to @xmath16 for our circular orbit simulations .",
    "after our truncation procedure is complete , the initial mass of the massive satellite is 0.018 @xmath17 , the low - mass satellite 0.001 @xmath17 , and the tiny - mass satellite 0.0001 @xmath17 . converting our simulation units to a milky way size galaxy system and evolving for a few satellite orbits",
    ", the low - mass satellite roughly corresponds in mass to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy halo @xcite .",
    "the massive and tiny - mass satellites are an order of magnitude more and less massive , respectively .",
    "the properties of these satellite halos is summarised in table [ tbl : satellites ] in units of the virial quantities of the host halo .",
    "all satellite initial conditions in this study have @xmath18 particles .",
    "we evolve each of the three satellites on three different orbits with the same energy but with different eccentricities .",
    "we define the eccentricity of the orbits as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the apocentre and the pericentre of a satellite .",
    "the first orbit is circular ( @xmath22 ) at @xmath16 .",
    "the second orbit has an @xmath23 with a pericentre of @xmath24 and an apocentre of @xmath25 , and the third orbit has @xmath26 with a pericentre of @xmath27 and an apocentre of @xmath28 .",
    "the third orbit is particularly relevant cosmologically since its _ circularity _",
    "( @xmath29),where @xmath30 is the angular momentum and @xmath31 is the angular momentum of a circular orbit with the same energy . ]",
    "is 0.5 , which is the median @xmath29 of subhalos in a sample taken from recent cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "we quote results using the following _ system _ units unless otherwise specified : @xmath32 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the timestep for our n - body simulations is @xmath33 system time units .",
    "therefore , one circular orbit is made of about @xmath34 timesteps because one circular orbit period is @xmath35     and a tidal distance corresponding to @xmath16 with an eccentricity @xmath36 .",
    "the virial radius orbit begins with @xmath37 and a tidal distance corresponding to @xmath38 with @xmath23 . owing to gravitational heating",
    ", the evolution of the two satellites is different but the profiles approximately agree when the total mass lose is the same . ]",
    "our satellite subhalo is initially truncated without considering its evolutionary history and without including any gravitational heating .",
    "this is crudely consistent with our initial condition generation procedure that assumes an equilibrium configuration at some radius inside the host halo to start .",
    "fortunately , this idealised setup does not produce an unrealistic satellite mass loss history . @xcite and @xcite performed a quantitative study of nfw subhalo evolution in a host halo using idealised n - body simulations and claim that satellites on two different orbits have similar mass and velocity profiles after losing the same amount of mass . to check this , we compared the evolved density profiles of two low - mass satellites on orbits with @xmath26 but at two different tidal distances : 1 ) the radius of a circular orbit with the same energy ; and 2 ) the host halo virial radius , @xmath6 . the first test describes the satellite evolution scenario adopted for this study .",
    "the second test describes the cosmologically - motivated scenario of a satellite entering the host halo for the first time .",
    "certainly , these two satellites have quite different evolutionary histories .",
    "however , when the bound mass of the two satellites is scaled to the same value , their evolved density profiles are similar , as shown in figure [ fig : profile_comp ] .",
    "this test , together with the results of @xcite and @xcite , suggests that our tidally truncated satellite models are a fair representation of cdm subhalos ( see figure 10 in * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , although tidal heating , which is sensitive to a satellite s structure , plays an important role in the satellite disruption process , we will show that the tidal tail morphology does not depend on a satellite s inner structure but only on a satellite s mass and orbit .",
    "for the gravitational potential solver , we use a three - dimensional self - consistent field algorithm ( scf , also known as an _ expansion _ algorithm , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this algorithm produces a bi - orthogonal basis set of density - potential pairs from which it computes the gravitational potential of a n - body system , given the mass and positions of the particles . for an arbitrary basis ,",
    "e.g. spherical bessel functions , the expansion generally requires a large number of terms to achieve convergence , which introduces small - scale noise as well as requiring greater computational expense .",
    "the situation was dramatically improved by @xcite using a numerical solution of the sturm - liouville equation to match the lowest - order pair to the equilibrium profile , and therefore , the expansion series converges rapidly . here",
    ", we use the current density profile as the zero - order basis function .    for our purposes ,",
    "this expansion algorithm is attractive for two reasons .",
    "first , the expansions can be chosen to follow structure over an interesting range of scales and simultaneously suppresses small - scale noise .",
    "in contrast , noise from two - body scattering can arise at all scales in direct - summation , tree algorithm , and mesh based codes .",
    "small - scale scattering can give rise to a diffusion in conserved quantities , which can lead to unphysical outcomes particularly for studies of long - term galaxy evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , the expansion algorithm is computationally efficient ; the computational time only increases linearly with particle number .",
    "hence , the expansion algorithm permits the use of a much larger number of particles than most other algorithms for the same computational cost .    an accurate potential solver for a cuspy halo demands a precise determination of the expansion centre , @xmath39 .",
    "this is the major disadvantage of the expansion algorithm relative to a lagrangian potential solver such as a tree code .",
    "we developed and tested the following algorithm for evolving cuspy dark matter halos with an expansion code :    1 .   at time",
    "step @xmath40 , we compute @xmath41 from the centre of mass of the @xmath42 most bound particles ; 2 .   to evaluate the expansion centre at time step @xmath43 , a predicted centre @xmath44 is estimated from a linear least squares solution using the previous @xmath45 centres : @xmath46 ; 3 .   for @xmath47 , we set @xmath48 .",
    "4 .   to reduce truncation error , we separately track the motion relative to the satellite s centre and the motion of the centre itself .",
    "the linear least squares estimator for the expansion centre @xmath49 reduces the poisson noise from the @xmath42 particles used to determine each of the @xmath41 . for our simulations",
    "we have adopted @xmath50 and @xmath51 and have verified that this centring scheme maintains the cusp while the satellite orbits in a host halo for situations where the tidal field is insignificant .",
    "time - dependent forcing by the host halo s tidal field adds energy to the satellite , driving mass loss and , ultimately , disruption .",
    "these forces are a combination of the differential force from the host halo and the non - inertial forces from the satellite orbit .",
    "the work done against the satellite s gravitational potential results in mass loss . in addition , these forces _ deform _ the outer density contours of the satellite . to understand the evolution of the ejecta",
    ", one must also consider the gravitational field of the satellite .",
    "the gravitational force from the satellite decelerates ( accelerates ) the leading ( trailing ) tail , modifying the energy and angular momentum of the ejecta well past the point of escape . the conserved quantities of the ejecta , then , may be dramatically different than that of the satellite centre of mass .",
    "the strength of the satellite gravity increases with satellite mass , of course .",
    "these effects combine to make the morphology of tidal tails more complicated than previously suggested @xcite , especially for a massive satellite .",
    "we investigate the causes of these effects and their consequences in detail below .       at @xmath52 ( top - left ) , @xmath53 ( top - right ) , @xmath54 ( bottom - left ) , and @xmath55 ( bottom - right ) .",

    "figure [ fig : framesltc3 ] shows a sequence of snapshots of the low - mass satellite ( @xmath58 ) on a circular orbit at @xmath16 .",
    "we use units where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and newton s gravitational constant @xmath32 , together which defines a natural time unit . scaled to the milky way , 0.5 natural time units is approximately 1 gyr .",
    "appealing to the standard zero - velocity roche potential , which balances the effective gravitational potential in the rotating frame with the halo potential , we expect the mass to become unbound in the vicinity of the lagrange or x - points .",
    "indeed , we observe the double cometary appearance of tails leading and trailing the satellite , enforced by the conservation of angular momentum . for this halo model ,",
    "the leading ejecta orbits faster than the satellite and has a position angle of @xmath61 measured from the positive vertical axis , the direction of satellite s instantaneous motion .",
    "the trailing tail moves slower than the satellite and has a position angle of @xmath62 .",
    "since the simulation in figure [ fig : framesltc3 ] ignores the satellite s gravity beyond the tidal radius , the orbit of the tidal tail merely represents the kinematic condition of the tail material just when it escapes from the satellite .",
    "an example of a randomly chosen orbit in the leading tail is shown in figure [ fig : orbtc3 ] .",
    "as expected , the orbit describes a rosette with its apocentre at the radius of the satellite orbit . the energy and angular momentum lost during the escape changes the conserved quantities of the ejecta orbits from that of the satellite orbit ; the leading ( trailing ) ejecta lose ( gain ) energy during deformation .",
    "moreover , the distribution of the tails fills a wide region about the satellite orbit .",
    "this reflects the broad distribution of phases for orbits at escape .",
    "hence , the width of the tail is nearly the same as the distance between the apocentre and the pericentre of a typical rosette orbit .",
    "each tail has several distinct _",
    "streamers _ filling a common envelope .",
    "the two primary streams in each tail demarcate the escape of the most extreme prograde and retrograde orbits .",
    "the originally prograde orbits have lower specific angular momentum and , therefore , smaller pericentres and larger epicyclic amplitudes .",
    "in contrast , originally retrograde orbits have larger pericentres and smaller epicyclic amplitudes .",
    "distinct streamers result from the phase caustics near apocentre , similar to shells in elliptical galaxies caused by merger ejecta with a velocity dispersion much smaller than its new orbital velocity .",
    "this mechanism , illustrated in figure [ fig : framesltc3 ] , is the _ massless _ description of tail formation .",

    ", the evolution is similar .",
    "however , at later times ( lower panels ) , the effects of the satellite gravity are marked .",
    "the continued acceleration of the tail by the satellite after escape decreases the internal velocity dispersion and narrows or focuses the tail as a consequence .",
    "the streamers in figure [ fig : framesltc3 ] become less distinct when accelerated by the gravity of the satellite and the host halo together for the same reason ( see figure [ fig : frameslsate ] ) .",
    "similarly , the acceleration of the ejecta by the satellite also decreases the angular separation between the streamers .",
    "although the multi - streamer feature is diminished as the satellite gravitational field accelerates the ejecta , the feature can still be seen very close to the tidal radius .                         the importance of a satellite s gravity increases with mass and , therefore , we begin with a study of the tail produced by a massive satellite .",
    "figure [ fig : framesmtc1 ] shows snapshots of a massive satellite ( @xmath63 ) on an circular orbit at @xmath16 , where once again the tail particles always feel the gravitational force from the satellite .",
    "the overall evolution of the satellite and its disruption time is similar to the less massive satellite shown in figure [ fig : framesltc2 ] .",
    "however , the long - term acceleration of the ejected material by the remaining satellite significantly alters these orbits .",
    "as the tail continues to lose mass , the leading and trailing tails evolve to positions that are well inside and well outside the satellite s orbit and hence does not trace the satellite orbit at all @xcite .",
    "the leading tail significantly tilts toward the centre of the halo and almost points directly there at late times .",
    "the trailing tail is distributed throughout a wide annulus in the outer halo .",
    "this difference results from the torque applied by the satellite _ well _ after escape .",
    "orbits in the leading tail that lose energy and angular momentum fall toward the centre of halo , while orbits in the trailing tail gain energy and angular momentum and spread over a wide range of radii in the outer halo .",
    "we show the tail morphology for our satellites with three different masses ( see table [ tbl : satellites ] ) on circular orbits at @xmath64 in figure [ fig : framescirc ] .",
    "the tidal tails in the low - mass and tiny - mass satellites ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ) very roughly follow the satellite orbit , with the leading and trailing tail located inside and outside of the satellite orbit .",
    "compared to figure [ fig : framesltc3 ] , it is clear that the differences decrease with the satellite mass . as we described in section",
    "[ sec : simulation ] , the low - mass satellite corresponds to the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy halo and the tiny - mass satellite corresponds to the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy halo .",
    "figure [ fig : compcirc ] shows the evolution of the distance from the host halo centre and the satellite s gravitational potential for an ensemble average of 10 randomly sampled particles near the tip of the leading tail in the three satellites .",
    "the tail from a massive satellite receives a larger torque and a larger shift to smaller energies and angular momentum than the tail from a lower - mass satellite .",
    "the bottom panel in figure [ fig : compcirc ] shows that the decay results from interactions with the satellite potential .",
    "figure [ fig : compcirc ] also shows that the satellite potential remains important in the low - mass and tiny - mass satellites when the tail is close to the satellite but it is unimportant when the tail is far from satellite .",
    "the satellite potential always remains significant for the massive satellite tail .",
    "the long - term influence of the satellite on the tail morphology makes any inference of the satellite orbit from the tidal tail impractical , especially for satellites on non - circular orbits ( see section [ sec : ecctail ] ) .",
    "the leading tail from the low - mass and the tiny - mass satellites in figure [ fig : framescirc ] exhibits kinks .",
    "the kinks are a consequence of the epicyclic motion of the tail orbits and of acceleration by the satellite at subsequent apocentres .",
    "figure [ fig : orbtc2 ] shows the ensemble averaged distance and positions for a sample of leading tail particles orbits taken from the low - mass satellite simulation shown in figure [ fig : framesltc2 ] .",
    "the kink occurs at the first apocentre of the ejecta , after it is decelerated by the satellite during and subsequent to its escape .",
    "the deceleration during escape tends to correlate the phases of the ejected orbits and results in a narrowing of the tidal tail s width .",
    "in contrast , the satellite potential accelerates the trailing tail particles , which increases the peri- and apocentres of the trailing tail .",
    "the analogous kink in the trailing tail is not so obvious because of its lower orbital frequencies .",
    "however , a plot analogous to figure [ fig : orbtc2 ] does show a similar oscillation with lower angular frequency .",
    "the large changes in the orbits of escaping particles orbits are easily understood using a restricted three - body approach .",
    "consider a satellite of mass @xmath67 in circular orbit at galactocentric radius @xmath68 in a halo of mass @xmath69 . in the frame of reference moving with a satellite of vanishingly small mass ,",
    "the effective potential is symmetric about the satellite centre .",
    "although orbital energy and angular momentum are not conserved , this system admits a conserved quantity , the jacobi constant : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the orbital energy and angular momentum and @xmath73 is the satellite s angular frequency about the host halo .",
    "this expression is easily derived by identifying a perfect time derivative in the inner product of the velocity vector and newton s equations of motion in the rotating frame of reference ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.3.2 ) .",
    "an isocontour of the jacobi constant passes through the x - points , @xmath9 , and demarcates the bound and unbound trajectories as shown in figure [ fig : jacobi]a . as the satellite mass increases",
    ", the inversion symmetry about the satellite centre is broken and the unstable points separate as shown in figure [ fig : jacobi]b . for small - mass satellites ,",
    "therefore , the tidal force is symmetric about the satellite centre leading to symmetric tidal tails as seen in globular clusters .",
    "however , for large - mass satellites , the asymmetry in the tidal force leads to asymmetric mass loss .",
    "now consider the mass lost through the inner ( outer ) critical point , @xmath9 .",
    "such orbits will have an inward ( outward ) velocity and unbound values of the jacobi constant .",
    "the force from the satellite continues to affect the orbit beyond the tidal radius in this restricted problem as in the n - body simulations .",
    "moreover , the smaller the mass of the satellite , the closer the radius is to that of the satellite , and the ejected orbit",
    "_ lingers _ near the original satellite orbit , partly offsetting the smaller gravitational force .",
    "for this reason , the orbit does not take on the orbital actions of the satellite but continues to be torqued by the satellite .",
    "one may estimate the scaling of this energy change by computing the work done in the satellite frame on the escaping tail particle ; this naturally takes into account the lingering .",
    "begin with the standard restricted three - body problem with generalised forces .",
    "assuming that the satellite orbits in the @xmath74-@xmath75 plane and using hamilton s equations , one may compute the @xmath76-component torque on an escaping particle and the change in angular momentum of the escaping particle after an interval @xmath57 becomes @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the hamiltonian , @xmath79 is the azimuthal coordinate conjugate to @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the gravitational potential of the satellite .",
    "the second equality in equation ( [ eq : ejtorque ] ) owes to the @xmath79 independence of all the other terms in @xmath78 .",
    "we may consider an escaping orbit in the limit that the mass of the satellite @xmath67 is much smaller than the mass of halo @xmath69 and use perturbation theory to evaluate equation ( [ eq : ejtorque ] ) . to do this ,",

    "the value @xmath92 is nearly conserved while the energy changes owing to work done during escape . changes in @xmath92 are caused by mass loss and the resulting evolution of the satellite s gravitational potential . ]    although the derivation of the scaling assumes @xmath93 , we demonstrate numerically that it applies over all values of interest by integrating the equations of motion in the rotating potential .",
    "we adopt @xmath94 and choose values of the jacobi constant that are 1% larger than the critical value passing through @xmath9 with zero velocity .",

    "moreover , the tidal field is nonaxisymmetric and this leads to spatial correlations in the energy and angular momentum of the least bound satellite particles , which in turn leads to the production of several apparently disassociated phase - space clumps before disruption .",
    "the observational detection of `` s''- or `` z''-shaped tidal tails in globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "we present new dynamical aspects and morphologies of tidal tails produced in satellites of significant mass , @xmath137 .",
    "there are two dynamical principles that affect the tail production for massive satellites .",
    "first , the leading and trailing x - points , points where the attractive force of the host halo and satellite are balanced at zero velocity , do not occur at equal distances from the centre nor do they have the same equipotential value for large - mass satellites ( see figure [ fig : jacobi ] ) .",
    "second , the escaped ejecta in the leading ( trailing ) tail continues to be decelerated ( accelerated ) by the satellite s gravity leading to large offsets of the ejecta orbits from the satellite s original orbit ( see figure [ fig : framesecc ] ) .",
    "we show that this is consistent with hill - jacobi theory ( generalised to dark - matter halos ) for satellites on circular orbits . in particular",
    ", the effect of the satellite s self gravity on the tail decreases only weakly with decreasing satellite mass , proportional to @xmath0 ( see section [ sec : circtail ] ) and , therefore , the acceleration by the satellite after escape is important for dwarfs and dark halos of modest mass .",
    "these findings have several important and useful theoretical and observational consequences .",
    "first , for a finite mass satellite , the morphology of the leading and trailing tails will be different owing to the gradient in the underlying halo potential across the satellite .",
    "in addition , the tail ejection occurs over a range of azimuth relative to the x - point owing to the dynamical response of the originally prograde and retrograde orbits to the tidal and non - inertial acceleration .",
    "these effects should be observable in high resolution imaging for both dwarf spheroidal and globular clusters ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : framesecc][fig : framesmtk2 ] ) .",
    "second , the radial velocity of tail particles will be displaced from that of the satellite orbit .",
    "the magnitude of the displacement is proportional to the satellite mass .",
    "these trends distort the ejecta from the gravitationally bound satellite trajectory in the @xmath122 plane in much the same sense as a satellite trajectory in a flattened halo ( see figure [ fig : vr_l ] ) .",
    "in other words , in fitting the @xmath124 diagram for tidal tails to satellite orbits of different flattenings , the satellite mass is covariant with halo flattening , i.e. the _ shape _ parameter @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , a constraint on the milky way halo shape using tidal streams requires mass - dependent modelling . finally , the acceleration of ejecta by a massive satellite during escape spreads the velocity distribution and obscures the signature of a well - defined `` moving group '' in phase space ( see figs . [",
    "fig : er_dsph2][fig : psp_dsph3 ] ) .",
    "although we believe that the physical effects described in this study are robust , our intentionally idealised simulations ignore several possibly relevant processes .",
    "first , the dynamical friction and the self - gravitation of the tail are ignored , although in all but the most extreme mass satellites their effects on the tail morphology will be negligible , since the mass in the tail is very small .",
    "second , we assume a smooth and static spherical host halo potential . in reality , over time , as the host halo mass grows its shape may change , and the ejecta will be perturbed by substructure .",
    "these time dependent effects will not affect the applicability of the dynamics described here but will complicate the prediction of observational signatures .",
    "finally , we have not included the physics of a dissipational baryonic component that may have slightly different kinematics than that of a dark collisionless component . in spite of these shortcomings",
    ", our study elaborates the details of satellite tidal tail production and the dynamics that bear on the interpretation of observed streams .    as an example ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite find that satellite tails follow the satellite orbit for dwarf galaxies whose mass is negligible compared to the galaxy mass .",
    "the mass of these satellites is usually similar to or less than our tiny - mass satellite . using these simulation results",
    ", @xcite developed an efficient numerical method to investigate the detectability and interpretation of tidal debris tails .",
    "however , we have demonstrated here that the gravity of the satellite for @xmath139 will change the actions of the tidal ejecta to mimic halo flattening ( see section [ sec : vr - l ] , figure [ fig : vr_l ] ) .",
    "in addition to the spatial distribution , the velocity distribution of the tail is affected by the satellite potential ( see section [ sec : psp ] ) .",
    "we would like to note that @xcite have also noticed a systematic distance offset for leading ( trailing ) tails inside ( outside ) the orbit of a satellite owing to the satellite potential .",
    "however , they did not focus on the tail morphology .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the interplay between the satellite and the host halo results in a complex tail morphology whose amplitude scales weakly with mass .",
    "although these findings complicate the interpretation of stellar streams and moving groups , the intrinsic mass dependence provides additional leverage on both the halo and on the progenitor satellite properties .",
