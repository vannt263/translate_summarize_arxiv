    "are double white dwarf ( dwd ) binary systems , as it is expected that a large fraction of main - sequence binaries end their lives as close dwds @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the gws emitted by these systems in our galaxy may form a background noise in the low frequency ( @xmath5 hz ) band of _ lisa_. the population of dwds in our galaxy is expected to be dominated by systems that undergo two distinct , long - lived phases of evolution : an `` inspiral '' phase , where both the stars are detached from their roche lobes and the loss of angular momentum in the form of gw emission causes the two stars to slowly spiral in towards each other ; and a `` stable mass transfer '' phase , where the less massive star fills its roche lobe initially and starts transferring mass steadily to its companion .",
    "an example of the stable mass transferring systems are the am cvn type systems , of which 18 @xcite are known through electromagnetic observations .",
    "see @xcite for more details . ] .",
    "apart from dwds , neutron star white dwarf ( nswd ) binary systems are also one of the promising sources of gws for lisa .",

    "specifically , several studies ( see for example : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that one of the possible formation scenarios of the so - called ultra compact x - ray binary ( ucxb ) systems , with orbital periods @xmath6 minutes , is that a low mass white - dwarf donor ( @xmath7 ) transferring mass to an accreting neutron star ( ns ) primary in a short orbit . in this scenario ,",
    "a detached nswd binary system initially evolves to a minimum orbital period as angular momentum is lost from the system due to gw radiation . at this minimum orbital period , the companion white dwarf ( wd ) star starts filling its roche lobe and transfers mass to the ns and the system evolves to longer orbital periods . at present",
    ", there are @xmath8 known ucxb systems with measured orbital periods , see table[table1 ] .",
    "some of these systems have accreting millisecond pulsars ( xte j1807 - 294 , xte j1751 - 305 & xte j0929 - 314 : see @xcite , for example ) and several of them are found in globular clusters as the stellar density and close encounters are more common @xcite .",
    "the total population of field ucxbs may be low , @xmath9 @xcite and theoretical studies by @xcite indicates that even at the galactic center , accreting ns systems do not contribute much to the faint x - ray population .",
    "in general , the capabilities of _ lisa _ as a gw detector are usually discussed in the context of the log @xmath10 log @xmath11 domain .",

    "the underlying physical properties of compact binary systems such as dwds and nswds , their evolution , and their relationship to one another in the context of stellar populations can be ascertained only if the observational properties of such systems are displayed in a @xmath15 diagram , rather than in a plot of @xmath16 versus @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite discussed the dwd binary systems in this context of `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency domain assuming that the donors in these systems follow zero temperature mass - radius relation . here",
    ", we will consider the effect of `` warm '' donors as proposed in @xcite and extend the discussion to nswd binary systems and compare the population boundaries between both of them .",
    "we also discuss the limits and applicability of these population boundaries in the log@xmath18 - log@xmath11 space within the context of observed am cvn and ucxb systems .",

    "the phase of a detached inspiral evolution terminates when the low mass wd companion comes into contact with it s roche lobe to initiate a phase of mass - transfer .",
    "since the donor is a wd star this contact period can be found by equating the radius of the star with the roche lobe radius . here , for the radius of the wd , we use the mass - radius ( m - r ) relationship of non - zero entropy donor models of @xcite .",
    "these models were initially developed for ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ucxb ) with wd donors .",
    "later @xcite applied them to model the donors in am cvn systems formed through wd channel . for these models",
    "the donors are assumed to be fully convective and corresponding donor evolution is considered to be adiabatic in nature due to the large mass- transfer rates produced in amcvn systems .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the assumption of adiabatic evolution is applicable during the beginning of mass - transfer phases ( when the mass - transfer rates are high ) and may not work when the system evolves to larger orbital periods with low mass - transfer rates .",
    "instead , they have identified new evolutionary phases and we will also discuss the impact of this most recent study on our population boundaries .",
    "we illustrate these boundaries by assuming that the donor composition is he , but it is straight forward to extend the discussion to carbon ( c ) @xmath1 oxygen ( o ) donors . in this section",
    ", we will discuss in detail the population boundaries of both dwd @xmath1 nswd . in ",

    ", we have also shown the contact boundary for @xmath41 , generated by eggleton s mass - radius ( m - r ) relationship for @xmath0 white dwarfs , ( blue dashed line ) , as quoted by @xcite and also by @xcite . at higher amplitudes and frequencies ,",
    "both the curves overlap each other .",
    "this is due to the overlap of m - r relations at higher masses as these objects are supported by degeneracy pressure and the @xmath0 m - r relation that we are using is applicable for fully degenerate he donors . at lower amplitude and frequencies ,",
    "the contact boundaries diverge slightly .",
    "this is because there is a turn over in the m - r relation at low masses for @xmath44 as the coulomb interactions dominate thermal contribution at that low temperatures and the m - r relations deviate .",
    "so this ( @xmath41 ) contact curve represents the boundary beyond which no dwds with he donors will be found . the corresponding boundaries for c @xmath1 o would lie just below this contact boundary , except that all three ( he , c @xmath1 o ) boundaries merge at high frequencies and deviate at low frequencies .    once the mass transfer phase is initiated , the orbital separation @xmath45 starts increasing and the system evolves to lower amplitudes and frequencies .",
    "the evolutionary trajectories can be then traced out by assuming that the donor wd star is marginally in contact with it s roche lobe and conservative mass transfer ( cmt ) holds true .",
    "for dwds , since we assume that the maximum mass in a dwd system is @xmath35 , we can generate a upper boundary beyond which no mass - transferring dwd system can exist .",
    "this limiting boundary for dwds can be obtained for systems with @xmath46 ( because , then , eventually @xmath47 will exceed @xmath35 ) when their @xmath48 drops below a critical @xmath49 @xmath50 accordingly , the ( green ) dashed line in fig .",

    "this curve represents the boundary beyond which no mass transferring dwds can exist .",
    "since the @xcite donor models have two branch nature , with a minimum attainable mass , it is reflected in this boundary as it curves up , with a minimum attainable gw amplitude for a given isotherm",
    ". corresponding boundary for donors with c @xmath1 o composition would lie below this he curve because a higher temperature is required for a c / o donor to fill the roche lobe than for a he donor . for comparison , a similar boundary that arises from @xmath0 m - r relation",

    "compared to t=0 model , as assumed in @xcite , hot donors in mass - transferring dwds occupy larger fraction of space in @xmath53 domain .",
    "this is because hot donors are also more massive , therefore have higher intrinsic gw amplitude and come into contact at lower frequencies because of larger radius .",
    "the inspiral phase of a wd binary evolution is driven by the loss of the angular momentum due to gw radiation and the inspiral evolutionary time scale @xmath54 can be written as : @xmath55 = \\frac { 5}{64 \\pi^2 } \\biggl ( \\frac{c}{rh_\\mathrm{norm } f^2 } \\biggr ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{tau_chirp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth noting that the time scale of evolution in both inspiral and cmt phases is of the order of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "therefore we have drawn `` chirp '' isochrones also in fig.[fig1 ] and each isochrone has a slope of @xmath57 in this log@xmath58 - log@xmath11 space , as can be seen from eq.([tau_chirp ] ) due to the dependence on the product of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "the value of @xmath54 is larger compared to that of at higher frequencies .",
    "a consequence of this behavior is that more binary systems accumulate at lower frequencies .",

    "the population boundaries for dwd @xmath1 nswd binary systems discussed in previous sections were generated using @xcite non - zero entropy donor models , which assume that the donors are fully convective and undergo adiabatic evolution throughout the mass - loss phase .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that these assumptions may not properly estimate the donor s orbital period evolution and specifically the donor s adiabatic evolution may not hold true for whole mass - transfer phase .",

    ", the donor responds to the mass loss adiabatically and starts expanding , which is considered to be the normal am cvn phase . but this phase of adiabatic expansion ends and a third phase of evolution begins at around @xmath77 min , when the mass - transfer rate ( and the donors thermal time ) drop enough for the donor to cool and start contracting to a fully degenerate configuration , stalling the @xmath75 evolution .    in the case of dwds ,",
    "the initial turn - on phase will result in the @xmath41 contact boundary ( green curve with crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) to have a width , instead of a sharp boundary as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this is because it is calculated assuming that once the system comes into contact , it would evolve towards lower amplitudes and frequencies , whereas @xmath75 decreases in the turn on phase , to a minimum even after the initial contact .",
    "accordingly , there will be a slight overlap of lower contact boundaries for he , c @xmath1 o donors .",
    "once the system evolves off this initial contact phase , the donor expands adiabatically in response to the mass - transfer and the system follows a typical am cvn evolution , where the gw amplitude @xmath1 frequency keeps decreasing as @xmath75 increases . assuming an adiabatic evolution means that the cooling time of the donor is longer than the mass - transfer time - scale ( @xmath78 ) , it will in turn affects the orbital evolution time - scale .",
    "accordingly , the donor follows a trajectory where it passes through different isotherms of decreasing @xmath48 , after the initial contact . as @xcite illustrate , the lower right curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the contact boundary for @xmath41 systems and similar contact boundaries for lower @xmath48 s would lie to the left of it , but the contact boundaries will shift towards lower amplitudes and frequencies .",
    "this phase of adiabatic evolution comes to an end between @xmath79 min , when the donor starts to cool and contract eventually towards a fully degenerate star .",
    "this will drastically ( almost an order of magnitude , see @xcite fig .",
    "15 ) reduce @xmath74 at these long orbital periods .",
    "hence , after this range of @xmath75 , the systems gw frequency evolution slows down in accordance with the drop in @xmath75 evolution .",
    "if the donor has cooled enough to approximate it as a @xmath0 degenerate model , then it may lie close to one of the @xmath0 contact boundaries , depending upon its @xmath48 .",
    "but these @xmath0 boundaries are bounded within the region constrained by @xmath64 ( light blue dot - dashed ) curve and the @xmath41 contact boundary ( green curve with crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , because these boundaries are drawn assuming that the donor is a fully degenerate star with @xmath0 and such a system can not exist beyond these curves .",
    "therefore , we have drawn a vertical ( brown ) dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] at @xmath80 min ( log@xmath81 ) beyond which we would expect these systems to be within the @xmath0 contact boundaries .",
    "note that this vertical line is not a sharp boundary : some systems may not reach a fully degenerate configuration by this @xmath75 .",

    "couple of them are clearly outside @xmath0 region ; for some of them , the system s mass function limits the minimum donor mass to a value above that of a roche - filling @xmath0 donor at the same @xmath75 .",

    "this may seem to imply that this system may be cooling off and trying to reach a @xmath0 degenerate configuration .",
    "but in fig 1 .",
    "of @xcite , they give a temperature range of log @xmath84 and @xcite noted that this system may have a hot donor .",
    "if that is the case , @xcite note that this donor may have evolved with constant entropy that it was born with or may have been heated by either the disk or the accretor .",
    "however , if irradiation is the cause , then @xcite note that it will delay the onset of donor s cooling and increases the temperature of the donor .",
    "so though this system lies below the @xmath83 boundary , it does not necessarily mean that the donor can be approximated as a zero - temperature object . ] .    for nswds , similar to dwds , the contact boundaries with he composition drawn assuming ns mass is @xmath66 ( green curve with crosses ) and @xmath67 ( green dashed curve ) will also have a width due to decrease in @xmath75 even after the contact .",
    "furthermore , the lower contact boundary lies _ below _ the upper contact boundary for dwds ( @xmath85 )",
    ". this will make the contact boundaries to `` overflow '' into the dwd region and lisa observations may not be able to distinguish these two types of systems in this region . here",
    "also the donor undergoes adiabatic evolution after @xmath74 reaches a maximum and consequently enters the cooling phase at @xmath86 min .",
    "accordingly , in fig . [ fig2 ] , the brown line shows the orbital period of this transition phase . beyond this line , the donors should start cooling and gw frequency slows down accordingly .",
    "[ fig2 ] also shows the currently observed ucxbs , which we assume to be mass - transferring nswd binary systems .",

    "[ fig2 ] lie _ below _ the lower contact boundary ( green cross curve ) , indicating that probably the donors are not of he composition .",
    "although , this contact boundary has a width , and hence they may have he composition , it is unlikely that we can observe them during this relatively short lived phase .",
    "moreover , these systems are plotted assuming the minimum mass of the donors mass range derived from observations , so this provides additional uncertainty in determining the composition of donors .",

    "it is clear that only one system ( 4u 1820 - 30 ) has enough signal strength to be visible to lisa , whereas some of the known am cvns emit gws above the instrumental and dwd background noise .",

    "<S> in an earlier investigation , we proposed population boundaries for both inspiralling and mass - transferring double white dwarf ( dwd ) systems in the distance independent `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency domain of the proposed space - based gravitational - wave ( gw ) detector , _ </S>",
    "<S> lisa_. the degenerate zero temperature mass - radius ( m - r ) relationship of individual white dwarf stars that we assumed , in combination with the constraints imposed by roche geometries , permits us to identify five key population boundaries for dwd systems in various phases of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> here we use the non - zero entropy donor m - r relations of @xcite to modify these boundaries for both dwd and neutron star - white dwarf ( nswd ) binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mass - transferring systems occupy a larger fraction of space in `` absolute '' amplitude - frequency domain compared to the simpler @xmath0 donor model . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how these boundaries are modified with the new evolutionary phases found by @xcite . in the initial contact phase </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the contact boundaries , which are the result of end of inspiral evolution , would have some width , as opposed to an abrupt cut - off described in our earlier @xmath0 model . </S>",
    "<S> this will cause an overlap between a dwds @xmath1 nswds evolutionary trajectories , making them indistinguishable with only lisa observations within this region . in the cooling phase of the donor , which follows after the adiabatic donor evolution , the radius contracts , mass - transfer rate drops and slows down the orbital period evolution . </S>",
    "<S> depending upon the entropy of the donor , these systems may then lie inside the fully degenerate @xmath0 boundaries , but lisa may be unable to detect these systems as they might be below the sensitivity limit or within the unresolved dwd background noise . </S>",
    "<S> we assess the limits and applicability of our theoretical population boundaries with respect to observations and find that a measurement of @xmath2 by lisa at high frequencies ( log @xmath3 \\geq 2 $ ] ) would likely distinguish between dwd / nswd binary . for low frequency sources , gw observations alone would unlikely tell us about the binary components , without the help of electromagnetic observations . </S>"
