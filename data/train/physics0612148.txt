    "it is well - known that large networked information systems ( e.g. citation networks or the web ) are explored by following the links between items @xcite .",
    "this process is at the heart of common search engines like google , and is based on the empirical observation that an individual surfing the web will typically follow of the order of 6 hyperlinks before switching to an unrelated site @xcite .",
    "practically , search engines mimic this behaviour by sending `` random walkers '' who , part of the time , follow links between websites , and otherwise jump to a randomly selected website in the network .",
    "the average number of walkers at a given node is the measure of the importance of the node in the network ( e.g. the google rank number ) . in view of this search mechanisms ,",
    "one expects that nodes with a higher density of walkers are visited more often , and should therefore receive more links from newly introduced nodes .",
    "this feed - back mechanism leads to an increase of the selected node degree , in a manner that may naively remind one of preferential attachment @xcite , as well as its density of walkers , thereby increasing the probability of the selected node to be chosen in the future , etc ...    in its most basic form , a growing network with redirection is defined as follows : a node enters the system , first connects to a target node ( chosen randomly in the whole network ) and then , with some probability @xmath1 , redirects its link to the ancestor of the target node .",
    "this model is well - known @xcite to lead to linear preferential attachment in the network , and to reproduce the formation of fat tail degree distributions @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "however , more realistic situations where the entering node follows @xmath4 links before connecting to a node ( see fig.1 ) have not been considered yet . from now on , we call this recursive exploration of the network @xmath0-redirection . in the following",
    ", we will mainly focus on the @xmath5-redirection case and restrict the scope to networks where nodes have only one outgoing link .",
    "we will show how this slight generalization leads to much more complicated situations than in the case @xmath6 , such as the formation of condensates in the network .",
    "if 2-redirection takes place , the entering node connects to the grand - father of the marked node with probability @xmath1 .",
    "otherwise , the entering node connects to the marked node.,width=384 ]    let us first study the simplest version of the model where entering nodes explore the network with @xmath7-redirection .",
    "initially ( @xmath8 ) , the network is composed of one node , the seed , and each time step @xmath9 , a new node enters the network .",
    "consequently , the total number of nodes is equal to @xmath10 , and the number of links is @xmath11",

    "the probability that a node at the depth @xmath12 in the directed network receives the link is : @xmath13 except for the seed @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the average number of nodes at depth @xmath12 .",

    "consequently , the redirecting process slows down the growth of the network .",
    "this is expected as redirection favours the connection to nodes closer to the seed . in the limiting case @xmath24 , where the process is easily shown to lead to a star network ( i.e. all the nodes are connected to the seed )",

    "let us evaluate the values of @xmath1 for which such a condensate exists and the corresponding value of @xmath36 .",

    "@xmath47 , we have shown above that @xmath62 is a proper eigenvalue and found the eigenvector eq.[eigenvector ] . in the following ,",
    "we look for the solution @xmath63 that is reached when @xmath53 .",

    "however , numerical integration of eq.[rec ] suggest that only this value @xmath75 is selected by the dynamics ( fig.[num]b ) . in the limiting case @xmath76 , the value @xmath62 is recovered .",

    "to do so , we focus on the relation @xmath77 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large values of @xmath12 , assume that @xmath78 is continuous and keep only the leading terms @xmath79 . in this case , the recurrence relation recasts into the following homogeneous differential equation : @xmath80 it is straightforward to show that the solutions of this equation undergo a transition at : @xmath81 above this value , the amplitude @xmath72 is definite positive and asymptotically behaves like en exponential @xmath82 , where @xmath83 . below this value , in contrast , the solution exhibits an oscillatory behaviour @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",

    "as soon as @xmath0-redirections with @xmath28 are introduced , the model exhibits complications in order to derive a closed equation for the degree distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that a _ 2-variable _ distribution for the degrees of the nodes at the extremities of one link @xcite has to be added in order to account for the 2-redirections .",
    "similarly , once one tries to write an equation for that distribution , the distribution involving three degrees characterizing two adjacent links has to be considered , etc .",

    "a mean field description through a truncature of the hierarchy at some level , even though possible in principle , has not been fulfilled yet and remains an open problem . in the following ,",
    "we restrict the scope to a numerical analysis of the degree distribution .",
    "to do so , we perform 50 computer realizations of the random process , measure the degree distribution after long times @xmath93 and average over the many realizations .",
    "computer simulations show ( fig.[num2 ] ) that the distribution reaches a stationary distribution except for a peak in its tail that advances in time .",
    "one observes that this peak velocity is @xmath94 , with @xmath95 defined above .",
    "this result is expected as the average seed degree is @xmath96 and that this quantity grows like @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , the stationary part of the distribution converges toward a power - law @xmath2 for large values of @xmath98 .",
    "we have verified the stationarity of this asymptotic state by measuring the degree distributions at different times @xmath9 .",
    "in this letter , we have focused on a simple model of growing directed networks , where the probability for a node to receive a link depends on the number of paths of length @xmath0 arriving at this node .",
    "this process , that we called @xmath0-redirection , generalizes a redirection process known to lead to preferential attachment @xcite and mimics the way people explore the web .",
    "we have shown that when @xmath99 , the system undergoes a transition to a regime where condensates develop around the seed node .",
    "condensates are nodes that receive a non - vanishing fraction of the links when the number of nodes @xmath100 goes to infinity .",
    "let us stress that such states have been observed in other types of model @xcite , and that such _ winner - takes - all _ phenomena are associated to _",
    "extreme _ configurations of the network , where a monopoly - like configuration develops .",
    "we have also focused on the degree distribution arising in such systems .",
    "computer simulations show that the degree distribution asymptotically reaches an almost stationary state , where only the degree of the seed makes the solution unstationary .",
    "the stationary part is shown to converge to a power - law distribution .",
    "it is remarkable to note that the exponents belong to the interval @xmath101 $ ] for most of the values of the redirecting probability @xmath1 .",
    "let us stress that this effect reminds the properties of another model with redirection @xcite .",
    "the mechanism that we propose could therefore give an explanation for the proliferation of exponents in that interval @xcite in many empirical studies , e.g. collaboration networks @xcite , the web @xcite ... to conclude , we would like to insist on the generality and simplicity of our approach , that is shown to exhibit a complex phenomenology . as a next step , analytical predictions for the degree distributions , based on mean field assumptions ,",
