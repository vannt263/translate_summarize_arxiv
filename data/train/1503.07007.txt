    "the financial market currently being formed in the aftermath of the great financial crisis looks completely different from the previous one .",
    "mandatory clearing for the standardized financial products and much higher regulatory costs for the rest of over - the - counter ( otc ) contracts made many investors withdraw from the long - dated exotic derivative business and pay much attention to the trading of listed products with exchanges or standard contracts with central counterparties .    in the new market",
    ", it is clear that the exchanges and central counterparties are the most important trading venues and have started to play a much bigger role than before .",
    "however , these new developments have not completely diminished the importance of the traditional key players in the market , that is a _ market maker_. a market maker is a firm that quotes buy and sell prices for financial securities and derivatives , and stands ready to perform these deals on a regular and/or continuous basis .",
    "they are crucially important to maintain liquidity for equities , currencies , commodities , government / corporate bonds , many structured products and derivatives . even for products tradable at an exchange",
    ", market makers are playing an important role by intermediating non - financial corporates and other investors since it is not always possible for them to satisfy many regulatory conditions required to get a direct access to the exchange .",
    "there exist many other benefits such as those related to accounting , anonymity and flexibility that may be obtained with the help of market makers .    especially due to the proposed regulation on the leverage ratio and the higher capital amount required for the open positions , the market makers have to deal with formidable tasks . due to the smaller warehousing capability of their balance sheets",
    ", they need more active position management . at the same time",
    ", they have to optimize execution strategies in order to avoid unnecessarily big market impacts and the associated transaction costs .",
    "see @xcite , for example , and other articles available in _ risk.net _ to get some images of the recent market .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the optimal position management problem for a market maker who is facing uncertain customer orders .",
    "we are interested in a _ good _ market maker who accepts every customer order with a predefined bid / offer spread",
    ". the spread can be stochastic but we do not allow the market maker to control its size dynamically based on its proprietary reasons in order to give a bias to the customer flows . otherwise the firm will not be considered as a trustful market maker  .",
    "we suppose that there exists a relatively liquid market for security borrowing and lending ( i.e. , so called repo transactions ) , which can be used by the market maker to answer the incoming customer orders .",
    "in addition to matching an incoming order directly to the security being warehoused in its balance sheet , it is assumed that the market maker can access two external trading venues .",
    "one is a traditional exchange where the market maker carries out absolutely continuous trading that incurs , however , a stochastic linear price impact .",
    "it is also supposed that the participants of the exchange can _ partially _ infer the inventory size of the market maker and that their aggregate reactions , as a preparation for the market maker s future unwinding , affect proportionally to the security price .",
    "another venue is the aggregate of the market maker s otc counterparties with which the firm can execute a block trade without directly affecting the price in the exchange . in this case , however , the execution timing is uncertain .",
    "the modeling of the latter venue ( we call it the dark pool ) is closely related to the one introduced by kratz & schneborn ( 2013 )  @xcite except that we allow stochasticity in its execution intensity .    there",
    "now exist the vast literature on the optimal execution problems .",
    "our model is closely related to the line of developments made by bertsimas & lo ( 1998 )  @xcite , almgren & chriss ( 1999 , 2000 )  @xcite , schied & schneborn ( 2009 )  @xcite and to more recent works ankirchner & kruse ( 2013 )  @xcite , ankirchner , jeanblanc & kruse  ( 2014 )  @xcite and kratz & schneborn ( 2013 )  @xcite . in this first approach ,",
    "the price process of the relevant security is exogenously modeled .",
    "there exist many other interesting approaches , such as models of supply curves  ( see , for example , bank & baum  ( 2004 )  @xcite , cetin , jarrow & protter  ( 2004 )  @xcite and roch ( 2011 )  @xcite . ) and those directly modeling the dynamics of limit order books  ( see , for example , obizhaeva & wang ( 2013 )  @xcite , alfonsi , fruth & schied  ( 2008 , 2010 )  @xcite , fruth & schneborn ( 2014 )  @xcite , and cartea & jaimungal  ( 2015a , b )  @xcite . ) .",
    "we refer to the review articles gatheral & schied ( 2013 )  @xcite and gkay , roch & soner ( 2011 )  @xcite for the recent developments , various other aspects and references .",
    "the two main differences of the current work are the focus on the market maker s position management problem with uncertain customer orders , and the generality in its setup .",
    "we allow quite generic stochastic processes for the securities , position impact factors , compensators of incoming customer orders , execution intensities of the dark pools , repo rates relevant for the security borrowing / lending , and the quadratic penalties for the outstanding position size etc . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", it is the most generic setup among the literature adopting the first approach in the last paragraph .",
    "the resultant optimal strategy becomes fully adapted to the market filtration instead of a deterministic one usually found in the literature .",
    "in contrast to a very short term liquidation strategy for which non - random ( or even constant ) coefficients may be sufficient , this generality is necessary for the position management problem with a longer time horizon in which a significant change of the market conditions is naturally expected .",
    "although the first approach we choose is a simplified reduced - form approximation of limit order books , it allows more flexible modeling of the underlying processes including multiple securities and also their mutual dependence , which is expected to be more relevant for our medium term problem .",
    "we follow the technique proposed by mania & tevzadze ( 2003 )  @xcite to derive the relevant stochastic hjb equation and its decomposition into three ( one non - linear and two linear ) backward stochastic differential equations ( bsdes ) . for a single security case ,",
    "we use the standard results on bsdes and the comparison theorem ( see , for example , ma & yong ( 2007 )  @xcite and pardoux & rascanu ( 2014 )  @xcite . ) for verifying the solution . for a multiple - security case , however , we need to handle a matrix - valued non - linear bsde for which we do not have an appropriate comparison theorem . we show that the relevant bsde is actually a special type of backward stochastic riccati differential equations ( bsrdes ) associated with a stochastic linear quadratic control ( slqc ) problem .",
    "interestingly , a seemingly quite different setup of the optimization problem gives rise to the same bsde .",
    "thanks to this relation , we can guarantee the existence of a uniformly bounded solution by theorems proved by bismut ( 1976 )  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty for the implementation of the proposed scheme is the concrete evaluation of this bsrde .",
    "we propose a perturbative expansion technique for the bsrde with a general markovian factor process , which only requires to solve a system of linear odes at each order of expansion . a justification and convergence rate of the approximation scheme are also given .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : sections 2 and 3 give some preliminaries , the detailed market description and the market maker s problem .",
    "section 4 gives the derivation of the candidate solution and its verification .",
    "an extension to a multiple - security case is given in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "sections 7 and 8 deal with implementation . in particular , the perturbative scheme and its error estimate are given in section 8 .",
    "the behavior of the terminal position size with respect to the penalty size is studied in appendix a.",

    "unfortunately , this seems unavoidable to keep the problem tractable .",
    "in addition to the above two trading venues , the market maker can match an incoming customer order to its outstanding position being warehoused in its balance sheet .",
