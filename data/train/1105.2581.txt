    "it was proposed in @xcite that one defining characteristic of black holes as quantum systems is their very fast rate of information scrambling . in systems with local degrees of freedom and local interactions",
    "the scrambling of information can often be assimilated to a diffusion process . in this case",
    ", we can say that locally coded information ` random - walks ' around the system , covering a volume @xmath1 in a time proportional to @xmath2 . for ` normal ' states , with extensive entropy , @xmath3 , we find scrambling times proportional to @xmath4 , measured in units of some typical time scale characterizing the state , such as the inverse temperature @xmath5 in relativistic systems .",
    "in contrast , the scrambling time for black holes is conjectured to be @xmath6 with @xmath7 the hawking temperature and @xmath8 the black hole entropy .",
    "roughly , it corresponds to the local scrambling for a system with infinite spatial dimension , @xmath9 .",
    "it is very interesting to elevate this estimate to the rank of fundamental law of nature , and regard black holes as the fastest possible scramblers @xcite .    the fast scrambling rate of black holes can be argued in a number of ways .",
    "it turns out that @xmath10 is the time scale that saturates the no - cloning bound in black holes , i.e. it is a measure of the minimum time for information retrieval in the hawking radiation ( cf .",
    "the same time scale can be identified in a kinematical effect characteristic of the ` membrane paradigm ' @xcite , where a conserved charge distribution on the stretched horizon , induced by the motion of external charges , undergoes non - relativistic ohmic diffusion with respect to the schwarzschild time variable .",
    "it follows that this induced charge spreads exponentially fast , filling a given area of horizon in a time which scales logarithmically with this area @xcite .",
    "finally , from the point of view of hypothetical holographic duals of the black hole , both matrix theory @xcite and ads / cft @xcite suggest the consideration of @xmath11 matrix models with @xmath12 degrees of freedom .",
    "the non - local character of the interactions of matrix elements in ` index space ' suggests that , precisely for these systems , we may get the maximal possible scrambling rate .",
    "it is somewhat striking that the two heuristic determinations of the @xmath10 time scale , based respectively on the no - cloning argument and the membrane paradigm , should look so different at a superficial level . in this note , we start by reinterpreting these arguments as causality bounds in a theory with a stretched horizon . in particular , it is pointed out that the no - cloning time is just the minimal reflection time from the stretched horizon , across the near - horizon region . with this definition ,",
    "we analyze a completely general near - horizon system embedded in a generalized ads / cft background and find a universal answer for such a ` reflection ' time : [ univ ] _ * = ( s_cell ) , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the entropy contained in a single ` thermal cell ' of the dual cft , a region with the size of the thermal length , @xmath5 , measured in the cft metric .    on general grounds , the idea that information should scramble ` as fast as the speed of light ' seems counterintuitive , motivating the view that no local or quasilocal model of the stretched horizon can describe such a phenomenon .",
    "in this note we propose a refinement in this conceptual tension .",
    "we argue that a purely kinetic phenomenological model can behave , in a certain sense , as a fast scrambler provided the scrambling is achieved in a few collisions , as in a classically chaotic system .",
    "the route to classical chaos in the near - horizon geometry is actually found in the conformally - related optical metric , which approximates any near - horizon region as a constant - curvature hyperboloid .    while rindler space is metrically equivalent to flat minkowski space",
    ", there are many dynamical properties , which depend on _ phase space _ rather than configuration space , which are better characterized in terms of the optical metric .",
    "in particular , the non - compactness of the optical metric is directly related to the non - compactness of the phase space at black hole horizons .",
    "the stretching of the horizon can be seen as a compactification of phase space which renders black - hole entropy finite .",
    "our analysis shows that these ideas tile beautifully with the chaotic nature of scrambling , since a compact hyperboloid is a classic paradigm of hard chaos .",
    "in this section we interpret the time scale @xmath15 in the near - horizon physics of an ordinary schwarzschild black hole in terms of a causality bound .",
    "we begin with the no - cloning argument ( see @xcite ) by noticing figure 1 , which illustrates the fact that the edge of the near - horizon region , given by the line @xmath16 , is symmetric to the singularity locus , @xmath17 , by a null reflection through the horizon . the points @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "are also symmetric and separated a proper distance of order @xmath20 from the horizon .",
    "if a q - bit falls into the black hole from @xmath21 to @xmath18 while it is cloned at the horizon and returns within the hawking radiation at @xmath22 , a local verification of the cloning could occur inside the black hole if @xmath18 and @xmath22 can have a common point @xmath8 in their future .",
    "notice that the points @xmath21 and @xmath22 are set at height @xmath23 because the cloned q - bit must be efficiently detected while it is emitted with wavelength of @xmath24 .",
    "this situation being incompatible with the linear evolution of quantum mechanical states , it must be that such a local meeting of the two copies is prevented by the occurrence of the singularity . in this way we obtain lower bound on the time delay between the two departures of the infalling q - bit from @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "[ clones ]    we compute this delay using the standard map between schwarzschild time and kruskal coordinates , @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath19 sits at the edge of the stretched horizon we have @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 and , by the reflection conditions @xmath28 , we find @xmath29 noting that the entropy @xmath30 we find , up to @xmath31 coefficients and neglecting @xmath24 additive contributions , @xmath32 the time - delay scale , @xmath33 , is equal to the ` reflection time ' from the stretched horizon or , in order of magnitude , a minimal free - fall time to the stretched horizon across the rindler region",
    ". we shall denote this kinematical time scale as the ` optical depth . '",
    "since @xmath20 enters logarithmically , this time scale is very robust in order of magnitude .",
    "for example , the same result is obtained with the much less conservative criterion that @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the mass of the black hole , so that the infalling q - bit is not heavier than the original black hole .",
    "the actual relevance of these arguments for the issue of information retrieval is not clear .",
    "first , it must be noted that the ` same bit ' can be extracted from a few hawking quanta provided one knows the black hole microscopic state with precision @xcite , something that requires monitoring the black hole for a time of the order of the evaporation time ( cf .",
    "even then , the complete _ decoding _ of the information contained in a single q - bit is likely to require time scales in excess of @xmath36 , the heisenberg time of the system controlling the detailed recurrences of the full quantum state ( cf .",
    "it is perhaps more appropriate to interpret @xmath37 as the _ causality _ bound on the minimum time for the information to be returned to the edge of the rindler region , i.e. the minimum time for the information to ` resurface ' in the outer layers of the black - hole s thermal atmosphere .",
    "notice that , while the causality bound is saturated by a ` mirror ' boundary condition at the stretched horizon , the no - cloning heuristic argument allows the ` processing ' of the q - bits at the stretched horizon to introduce further delays of @xmath24 , or even of @xmath38 , without affecting the bound in order of magnitude .",
    "a second argument introducing the time scale @xmath39 uses the dynamics of induced charge densities on the stretched horizon according to the membrane paradigm @xcite .",
    "these charges are nothing but rescaled versions of the normal electric field at the stretched horizon , and their spacetime variations can not violate local causality .",
    "the fastest possible variations of such electromagnetic fields can be induced by letting a moving source charge above the horizon approach the speed of light , leading naturally to the time scale @xmath33 , since that is the characteristic time for the source charge to cross the rindler region . to see that an exponentially fast spread , as measured in asymptotic time , is compatible with causality we may recall a simple argument from @xcite showing that such a behavior is precisely _ saturating _ the causality bound , rather than contradicting it .",
    "let us define the stretched horizon in locally flat coordinates @xmath40 as the rindler surface @xmath41 the future light - cone bounding causal events originating at a point of coordinates @xmath42 on the stretched horizon is given by @xmath43 which intersects the stretched horizon itself along the hypersurface @xmath44 where we have inserted the long - time asymptotics of @xmath45 , with respect to the asymptotic schwarzschild time variable , showing the exponential rate which fills an area of order @xmath46 in a time of order @xmath33 .",
    "notice that the light rays between two points on the stretched horizon do not propagate confined to the stretched horizon , but actually go _",
    "above _ it through the bulk of the rindler region , a simple fact that will be crucial in what follows .",
    "these arguments leave us in a quandary regarding the interpretation of @xmath33 as a scrambling time .",
    "since any process measured by scales of order @xmath33 is saturating causality in order of magnitude , this means that the purported scrambling must be not only fast but in fact as fast as it can be .",
    "hence the suggestion that fast scramblers can not behave like standard local diffusion at all : a fast scrambler must work at _ ballistic _ speed .",
    "meanwhile , interactions of probe q - bits with the hawking radiation are small at least for a time of order @xmath33 , since the ` fall ' is well approximated as a _",
    "free fall_.      in this section",
    "we give an estimate of the optical depth for a general near - horizon geometry with a putative holographic dual .",
    "the main purpose of this exercise is to express the result in terms of dual qft variables in a situation where the ads / cft lore may be applied .",
    "consider a general @xmath47-dimensional background which may admit a holographic interpretation in terms of a @xmath48-dimensional field theory at finite temperature : [ holob ] ds^2 = f()(-h ( ) dt^2 + d^2 ) + d^2 h ( ) , where @xmath49 is the holographic radial coordinate , parametrizing the uv regime at large @xmath49 and the ir regime at small @xmath49 .",

    "the near - horizon , or rindler region , reaches out to radii of order @xmath58 , defined by @xmath59 . in the linear approximation",
    "we have @xmath60 , which gives an order - of - magnitude estimate for @xmath58 .",
    "the hawking temperature is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 .    throughout our discussion , we assume that the temperature is much larger than any other energy scale in the dual qft state , so that we can neglect finite - size effects in the geometrical set up",
    ". the stretched horizon is set at planck distance from the horizon , at coordinate @xmath63 defined by @xmath64 using @xmath65 we find the relation @xmath66 which expresses the fact that the local blue - shifted temperature , proportional to @xmath67 , grows from @xmath68 at the edge of the rindler region , to planckian order @xmath69 at the stretched horizon .",
    "null radial trajectories are better described in terms of the regge ",
    "wheeler coordinate , @xmath70 defined by @xmath71 where the minus sign is meant to indicate that @xmath70 grows ` inwards ' .",
    "the metric in this frame reads [ rwhe ] ds^2 = f(z ) h(z ) ( -dt^2 + dz^2 ) + f(z ) d^2 , so that null radial trajectories satisfy @xmath72 , and the optical depth can be measured directly by the extent of the @xmath70 coordinate .",
    "the same null trajectories occur in the conformally - related metric [ opme ] ds_op^2 = -dt^2 + dz^2 + h(z)^-1 d^2 , so - called ` optical metric ' @xcite . with an appropriate choice of the additive normalization for the @xmath70 coordinate , we find that the optical metric of the holographic background ( [ holob ] ) has the following _ universal _ structure : the asymptotic vacuum region is represented by a flat strip of length @xmath73 , [ asymop ] ds_op^2 -dt^2 + dz^2 + d^2 , 0<z <",

    "we find that the no - cloning time scale @xmath87 is sensitive to the parameters of a single thermal cell .",

    "the dynamical time scales at the horizon are rendered finite by specifying a phenomenological ` stretching ' , whose crudest version is the brick - wall model @xcite , consisting on a sharp mirror at planckian distance from the horizon .",
    "this simple boundary condition discretizes the spectrum of fields in the right amount to account for the finiteness of the entropy , even for a thermal state of free quantum fields .",
    "such a finite entropy turns out to be _ extensive _ in the optical metric , @xmath97 with the optical volume of the region outside the stretched horizon scaling as @xmath98 ( cf .",
    "this simple argument shows that the optical metric provides a good geometrical intuition for the ` phase space size ' of the thermal atmosphere , i.e. the number of states supported by the system . in the conformally related frame of the optical metric ,",
    "the hartle  hawking state of quantum fields is a homogeneous thermal state of constant temperature @xmath7 over a cut - off version of the hyperboloid ( [ hy ] ) .",
    "this very crude model reproduces the right time scale of recurrences @xcite .",
    "it also introduces a ballistic free - fall time scale of order @xmath33 , which is not obviously related to ` scrambling ' since interactions of localized probes with the thermal atmosphere are suppressed by powers of @xmath99 . on the other hand , low - energy effective field theory must be violated at the stretched horizon , so that the @xmath99 estimate for the interactions breaks down at the wall .",
    "this is one of the basic tenets of black - hole complementarity @xcite , and can be seen in this context by noticing that a planck - mass field @xmath100 does make a contribution of order @xmath101 to the effective potential ( [ rindl ] ) when dragged to the stretched horizon @xmath102 .",
    "hence , we can scramble the probe by letting it interact strongly at the wall , after a ballistic glide of @xmath33 duration .    a naive treatment of such a ` wall - scrambling ' seems to suggest a behavior of ` slow - scrambler ' type . in the optical - frame description ,",
    "the state of the bulk quantum fields is thermal with uniform temperature @xmath7 .",

    ", we see that a qft thermal cell is scrambled in a time of order @xmath107 . ]    in the next section we argue that this estimate is not quite correct .",
    "the reason is that , while the collisions are happening at the stretched horizon , the ballistic glide between collisions is not necessarily confined to the stretched horizon hypersurface .",
    "in fact , as already pointed out in section 2 , the faster free - fall motion between two points on the stretched horizon takes a path _ above _ the stretched horizon .",
    "this fact , combined with the peculiar geometry of the rindler space , will suffice to provide a kinetic model of the thermal atmosphere with fast ` scrambling ' features .",
    "let us consider a planck - localized probe following null geodesics in the rindler region , punctuated by collisions of @xmath31 strength at the stretched horizon ( we neglect the collisions of @xmath108 strength within the bulk of the thermal atmosphere ) .",
    "in order to benefit from the geometrical intuition , we notice that any such piecewise - null trajectory defines a corresponding piecewise - null trajectory on the conformally - related optical manifold ( [ rindlop ] ) with hyperbolic spatial sections . therefore , we can use the optical metric to discuss the dynamical time scales of such an ideal probe motion .",
    "the advantage of this description is the uniform proportionality between time scales for null propagation and ` optical ' length scales .",
    "the optical box supports a thermal state of bulk fields at _ uniform _ temperature @xmath7 , which can be approximated as an ideal gas ( up to small @xmath99 effects , ) except at the stretched horizon , where the thermal fields are regarded as strongly interacting , with a bulk thermal cell of ( optical ) size @xmath73 .",
    "consider a localized probe sent radially inwards with a maximal ( planck ) bulk resolution at the top of the rindler region , as measured in the physical metric ( [ holob ] ) , i.e. the initial resolution @xmath109 in the @xmath54 coordinate satisfies @xmath110 the geometrical stretching of the optical metric implies that such a probe is smeared over a region whose optical size in the @xmath54 directions is of order @xmath111 on arrival to the stretched horizon .",
    "the thermal state of strongly interacting degrees of freedom at the stretched horizon has thermal length of @xmath112 ( again , in the optical metric ) , which determines the effective interaction length of probe scattering at the stretched horizon . since the effective resolution in the impact parameter for these scattering events is also of @xmath112",

    "our proposed ` ballistic catalysis ' of the scrambling is only effective as long as the glides are large geodesic arcs on the hyperbolic optical geometry ( [ hyps ] ) .",

    "on the other hand , it is not obvious that the kinetic notion of scrambling adopted here is the relevant one from the point of view of the issues of black - hole information retrieval , as laid down in @xcite . in particular , while classical chaos implies a certain notion of scrambling in position space for local probes , over times of order @xmath33 only a few scattering events can take place and thus only a small subspace of the complete hilbert space has a chance to entangle with the probe . in addition , non - local probes such as extended branes may behave in quite a different way from the ` billiard paradigm ' outlined here , so that strongly nonlocal physics on the scale of the thermal length may still be required to achieve scrambling in the sense of the quantum entanglement test @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that the details of the scrambling will depend on the structure of the state , such as the initial degree of localization of the information . in this context",
