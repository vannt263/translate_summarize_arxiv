    "the goal of this paper is to derive kepler s laws of planetary motion from the law of universal gravitation using purely geometric methods .",
    "my motives for this are entirely aesthetic .",
    "there s no question that modern calculus gets the job done , but there is a certain thrill that comes from old - fashioned euclidean geometry , with its similar triangles and tangent lines . except for a small number of instances , the reader is encouraged to forget all the calculus they know in order to better enjoy the mathematics . since this",
    "paper deals with results that are known to be true with complete rigor , the style here will be quite informal and nonrigorous .",
    "as my advisor used to say , we re going to play fast and loose .",
    "the idea for the paper came about by reading two books .",
    "the identity of the first , _ principia _ by isaac newton , should be obvious .",
    "newton s masterpiece was an inspiration to me when i discovered it in graduate school , and is a feast for geometry lovers .",
    "unfortunately , _ principia _ presents the modern reader with a few obstacles that get in the way of the beautiful mathematics . to begin with",
    ", the style is difficult and unfamiliar , and the translations that i have seen contain words which are not in common use these days .",
    "second , newton assumed many theorems about conics which apparently were well known to mathematicians of his day .",
    "sadly , studying the conics has fallen out of favor a bit in the time since then , so that even professional mathematicians may have to do a bit of work on their own to make it through _ principia _ , as i did .    given these difficulties , it is natural to attempt to `` translate '' newton s work into modern notation , with background material supplied where necessary . the most notable recent attempt at this that i know of was by richard feynman , and presented in a lecture to students at the california institute of technology(in fact",
    ", the core of the argument that feynman used had already been discovered by the great james maxwell , and was published in @xcite , though feynman was probably unaware of it ) .",
    "feynman s lecture has survived in the form of @xcite .",
    "this is a very enjoyable book , and feynman s discussion is ingenious , but it fell short of real satisfaction for me for two reasons .",
    "first of all , feynman does not derive kepler s third law in its entirety from newton s laws .",
    "perhaps his methods could lead to a derivation , but it is nt mentioned in the book .",
    "secondly , and more seriously , feynman went out of his way to avoid dealing too much with the geometrical properties of the conics . certainly a person has the right to dislike the conics if they choose , but i have always ascribed more to the archimedean school of thought which contends that the greatest joy in physics lies in the wonderful geometrical problems that arise . in other words ,",
    "the motion of the planets around the sun gives us a great excuse to study the conics .",
    "this paper , then , is a record of my attempt to understand newton s work on planetary orbits .",
    "my argument departs from his at some point , but up to that point the paper is largely just a retelling of selected pieces of _ principia_. the next section is introductory material on conics .",
    "the third section follows newton s work , with auxiliary lemmas added where needed .",
    "the first theorem in the fourth section is also from _ principia _ , while the rest of the section gives the way i came up with to deduce kepler s first and third laws .",
    "this part of the paper can be considered original , to my knowledge .",
    "the fifth section gives a solution to a natural problem in mechanics which is found to be extremely simple using the methods in the fourth section . if the reader can obtain from this paper @xmath0 of the enjoyment that i felt while studying _",
    "principia _ , they can consider it time well spent .",
    "it is expected that the reader has some familiarity with the conics . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "however , i have included essentially everything relevant below .",
    "a reader with a good working knowledge of the conics can safely skim this section .",
    "before we look at the conics , i should mention some possibly nonstandard bits of terminology that i will use .",
    "the _ measure _ of an arc on a circle is defined to be the magnitude of the angle it subtends at the center of the circle .",
    "for example , the measure of arc @xmath1(abbreviated as @xmath2 ) below is @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , when an angle inside a circle subtends a pair of arcs in both directions , we say that the angle _ covers _ the arcs .",
    "for example , in the picture below , angle @xmath4 covers arcs @xmath1 and @xmath5 .        for reasons which i am at a loss to explain ,",
    "the following theorem is rarely given in full generality when it is presented in high schools .",
    "suppose that two lines intersect at an angle @xmath4 either inside or on a circle .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath5 be the arcs covered by @xmath4 .",
    "then    m(ab ) + m(cd ) = 2    * proof : * draw the lines parallel to the original two lines but which pass through the center of the circle @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the points of intersection of these new lines with the circle , as shown below .",
    "we have    m(ab ) + m(cd ) = m(ab ) + m(cd ) = m(ab ) + m(cd ) as @xmath8 by definition , we are done .",
    "note that this proof works just as well if the angle lies on the circle , and includes the case where one of the lines is a tangent to the circle .",
    "the tangent to a curve more general than a circle must be defined .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath9 be two points on a curve which are close to each other , and let @xmath9 be fixed . draw the line containing both @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "as we let @xmath6 approach @xmath9 , if the line containing @xmath6 and @xmath9 gets closer and closer to a fixed line @xmath10 , we define @xmath10 to be the tangent at @xmath9 .",
    "we are nt going to worry about whether such a @xmath10 exists , we ll just assume it does(as it does ) for the curves we care about",
    ".    finally , i will write things like `` the slope of the cone '' and `` the slope of the plane '' . these are not standard terminology , but should cause no confusion . given a cone , orient it so that the vertex is pointing directly up . the vertical line through the vertex is the axis of the cone , and we define the slope of the cone to be the ratio @xmath11 below .",
    "note that @xmath6 is the center of the base , and @xmath12 is a point on the outside of the base .        to define the slope of a plane @xmath9 , begin by drawing a vertical line @xmath13 passing through the plane at a point @xmath9 .",
    "choose a point @xmath6 on @xmath13 but not on the plane , and let @xmath12 be the closest point on the plane so that @xmath14 is perpendicular to @xmath13 .",
    "then the slope of the plane is defined to be @xmath15 .",
    "the following lemma will help in dealing with tangents .",
    "tangent suppose that a circle is tangent to a pair of lines with points of tangency @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and that the pair of lines meet at @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the center of the circle .",
    "then @xmath20 is parallel to @xmath21 .",
    "* proof : * the proof is immediate , since the entire picture is symmetric around the angle bisector @xmath21 .",
    "suppose we have two circles of different radii with the smaller contained in the larger .",
    "we are allowing in this setup that the smaller is internally tangent at a point to the larger .",
    "let @xmath22 be the set of all points which are centers of circles tangent to both of our original circles .",
    "then @xmath22 is a curve , and this curve is an _",
    "ellipse_.        the two centers of the original circles are known as the _ foci _ of the ellipse .",
    "the following proposition gives the property of ellipses which is usually used to characterize them .",
    "sum the sum of the distances from the foci of an ellipse to any point on the ellipse is equal to the sum of the radii of the two original circles .",
    "* proof : * examine the picture below .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the centers of the two fixed circles of radius @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath6 is a point on the ellipse whose corresponding circle has radius @xmath27 .",
    "we see that @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , @xmath30 , a constant .",
    "and now we have the all - important reflection property .",
    "refell a beam of light fired from one vertex which reflects off the ellipse will strike the other vertex .",
    "in other words , @xmath31 .        * proof : * draw the circle with center @xmath6 which is tangent to the two original circles . if point @xmath6 moves infinitesimally along the ellipse , the circle with @xmath6 at the center will expand or contract .",
    "since we are only moving infinitesimally , we can replace the two original circles with their tangents at points @xmath12 and @xmath32 and apply lemma [ tangent ] .",
    "these tangents are also tangent to the circle with @xmath6 at the center , and are therefore perpendicular to @xmath33 and @xmath34 . applying lemma [ tangent ] , we conclude that a tangent vector to the ellipse at @xmath6 is given by @xmath35 , and thus the tangent bisects @xmath36 so that @xmath37        * remarks : * i)if the two foci coincide , then the curve is a circle , and we see that circles are just special cases of ellipses .",
    "\\ii ) the property of ellipses given in proposition [ sum ] is often given as the defining property of ellipses .",
    "it is left to the reader to show that any curve that satisfies proposition [ sum ] can be created by the construction that we have used to define ellipses .",
    "\\iii ) all ellipses besides circles can be created by our construction where the smaller circle is internally tangent to the larger , and it is generally simpler to assume that the two circles are tangent .",
    "we did nt want to to assume that here , though , as we want to include circles .",
    "for the remaining conics we lose no generality in assuming tangency , and we will do so , though it is not necessary .",
    "suppose now we have two circles of different radii which are externally tangent .",
    "let @xmath38 be the set of all points which are centers of circles which are externally tangent to both circles .",
    "@xmath38 is a curve , and this curve is known as a _",
    "the centers of the original circles , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are known as the foci of the hyperbola        the difference between the distances from the foci to any point on the hyperbola is a constant .    *",
    "proof : * let @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath39 be the radii of the circles centered at @xmath40 , and @xmath6 in the above picture . then    f_2o - f_1o = ( r_2+r_o ) - ( r_1 + r_o ) = r_2-r_1 this is a constant , so we are done .    as with the ellipse , we have a very pretty reflection property .",
    "suppose we fire a beam of light from infinity(in other words , from outside the picture ) at one of the foci .",
    "if the beam strikes the hyperbola before reaching the focus , it will reflect off the hyperbola and strike the other focus .",
    "that is , @xmath41 .        *",
    "proof : * pick a point @xmath6 on the hyperbola , and draw all relevant circles",
    ". we must show @xmath42 .",
    "but this follows directly from lemma [ tangent ] as in proposition [ refell ] .",
    "* remarks : * i ) if the two original circles have the same radii , the hyperbola reduces to a straight line .",
    "\\ii ) in most books on conic sections , the hyperbola consists of two parts , one such as we have described , the other the mirror image reflected around the midpoint of @xmath43 .",
    "this mirror image will be obtained by the same construction , interchanging the radii of the circles centered at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the last conic section is the parabola .",
    "suppose that we have a circle of radius @xmath44 tangent to a straight line .",
    "let @xmath9 be the set of all points which are the centers of circles tangent both to the line and externally to the circle .",
    "@xmath9 is a curve , known as the @xmath45 .",
    "the center of the original circle is called the _ focus_.        displacing the original line @xmath44 units down forms a new line @xmath13 , known as the _",
    "directrix_.    the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the distance from that point to the directrix .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath6 be a point on the parabola , and let the corresponding circle have radius @xmath46 .",
    "then the distance from the focus to @xmath6 is @xmath47 , as is the distance from the directrix to @xmath6 .",
    "finally we have the reflection property , the one that archimedes is reputed to have used to torch attacking roman ships .",
    "a beam of light coming straight down will strike the parabola , reflect off , and hit the focus .",
    "in other words , in the picture below @xmath48 .    * proof : * using lemma [ tangent ] as in proposition [ refell ] , @xmath49 .        a plane which cuts through a cone without touching the vertex",
    "gives one of the conic sections .",
    "the slope of the plane determines which conic we obtain . a plane",
    "whose slope is less than the slope of the cone produces an ellipse .",
    "a plane with a greater slope than the slope of the cone gives a hyperbola .",
    "a plane whose slope is the same as the slope of the cone gives a parabola .",
    "let us examine why this is so , beginning with the ellipse .",
    "suppose that we have a sphere @xmath50 and a point @xmath6 away from the sphere in three dimensions .",
    "then the set of all rays beginning at the point which are tangent to the sphere will form a cone , and we will say that the sphere is _ inscribed _ in the cone .",
    "the set of points on the surface of @xmath50 which are touched by the cone will form _ the circle of tangency_. the points on this circle are equally distant from @xmath6 , since rotating the entire picture around a vertical axis through @xmath6 by any angle does not change the picture .",
    "suppose we slice a cone with a plane @xmath9 as shown below .",
    "let a small sphere be inscribed in the cone above the ellipse , and a large sphere inscribed below the ellipse .",
    "expand the small sphere while keeping it inscribed in the cone until it is tangent to @xmath9 at point @xmath16 .",
    "contract the large sphere in the same way until it is tangent to @xmath9 at @xmath17 .",
    "the result is that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the foci of the ellipse . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath51 be a point on the ellipse .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be the circles of tangency of the two spheres , and let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be the points on @xmath52 and @xmath53 closest to @xmath51 , i.e. such that @xmath56 is a straight line . since @xmath57 and @xmath58 are both tangent to the larger sphere , their lengths are equal .",
    "the same is true for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "thus , @xmath61 , which is a constant independent of the choice of @xmath51 .",
    "we see that the curve formed is indeed an ellipse , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 as its foci",
    ".        now let s do something similar with the hyperbola .",
    "we need to extend the rays through @xmath6 to form another cone above .",
    "intersect a plane @xmath9 with the cone to form a curve @xmath38 , as shown below .",
    "start with two small inscribed spheres above and below @xmath6 , and expand them until they are tangent to @xmath9 at points @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be the circles of tangency of the spheres .",
    "choose a point @xmath51 on @xmath38 , and let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be the points on @xmath52 and @xmath53 so that @xmath62 is a straight line . since @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we see that @xmath65 , which is a constant .",
    "thus , @xmath38 is a hyperbola , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 the foci .",
    "now for the parabola .",
    "we let @xmath9 be a plane with the same slope as the cone , as shown below .",
    "expand a small inscribed sphere near @xmath6 until it becomes tangent to @xmath9 at @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath66 be the circle of tangency of this sphere , and draw a line @xmath13 on @xmath9 at the same height as @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath51 is a point on the curve , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the point on @xmath66 such that @xmath69 is a straight line . drop a perpendicular to line @xmath13 from @xmath51 to point @xmath70 . since @xmath9 is at the same angle to the vertical as the side of the cone and",
    "@xmath66 is at the same height of @xmath13 , @xmath71 , so that @xmath67 .",
    "we see that the curve is a parabola with vertex @xmath16 and directrix @xmath13 .",
    "before we move on , let us notice one more thing about the parabola example .",
    "let us keep everything as it was , but change the angle of the plane @xmath9 .",
    "we now have an ellipse or a hyperbola , and it is no longer true that @xmath72 .",
    "however , it is true that @xmath73 is a constant , since it can be expressed as the ratio of the slope of the plane and the slope of the cone .",
    "we obtain a new description of the conics .",
    "ecc let @xmath13 be a line and @xmath16 a point in the plane .",
    "the conics can be realized as the set of all points @xmath68 such that @xmath74 , where @xmath70 is the point closest to @xmath68 on @xmath13 , and @xmath75 is a constant .",
