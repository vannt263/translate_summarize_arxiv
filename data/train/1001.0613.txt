    "the calculation of the production cross sections at hadron colliders relies upon a knowledge of the distribution of the momentum fraction @xmath0 of the partons ( quarks and gluons ) in a proton in the relevant kinematic range , and the corresponding fragmentation functions .",
    "most probably , at lhc , we will be confronted with a copious production of jets what will severely limit the exclusive analysis of individual jets .",
    "it seems therefore interesting to separate the events in function of their _ multi - jetiness _ and to study the parameters of the collisions _",
    "e.g. _ mean @xmath1 , mean multiplicity , etc .",
    ", in function of different parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) present on the market , which as quoted by the cteq group allows for an uncertainty of about 10 - 20%  @xcite .",
    "obviously this uncertainty will reflects in the quantification of the kinematical processes .",
    "the pdf s are of importance to analyze standard model processes at lhc energies  @xcite , and the usual leading order event generators use the pdf s as an input to evaluate hard subprocess matrix elements . in those calculations the multiple parton interactions that make up the bulk of the underlying event , require extensive tuning which depends strongly on the details of the input parton distributions .",
    "+ the event shape analysis ( esa ) has been applied successfully to the restricted acceptance experiments at rhic and alice to survey the possibilities of the method to analyze and isolate specific jet topology events  @xcite . in the present paper we are investigating the bulk properties of the event shape variables obtained in minimum bias pp events : the sensitivity obtained at different collisions energies focussing to minimum bias collisions , corresponding to the minimum _ x",
    "- bjorken _ ( @xmath2 ) achievable .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the section  [ sec : ii ] we give the relation for the sphericity and recoil distributions ; in the section  [ pdfs ] we discuss the parton distribution functions used and the way the simulations were done in the framework of minimum bias pythia .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ results ] and finally , in section  [ conclusion ] the conclusion are drawn .",
    "event shape variables allow us to measure geometrical properties of qcd final state  @xcite .",
    "those variables has been used to analyze dijet production in hadron - hadron collisions and to study the sensitivity of physical parameters  @xcite .",
    "the shape variables at hadron colliders are defined over particles within the acceptance of the detector .",
    "the thrust ( @xmath3 ) is defined in the transverse plane as follows : @xmath4 where the sum runs over all particles in the final state within the acceptance , @xmath5 represent the transverse component of the momenta of emitted particles and @xmath6 is the transverse vector that maximizes the ratio . in the literature",
    "it is more common to find the quantity @xmath7 related to the transverse sphericity of the event . in the present work",
    "we do reference to this as sphericity .",
    "the range of sphericity is between 0 ( for events with narrow back - to - back jets ) and @xmath8 ( for events with a uniform momentum distribution ) .",
    "another interesting observable is the recoil , defined as : @xmath9 it is an indirect measurement for the radiation which remains undetected for acceptance effects ( high inbalance : @xmath10 , small inbalance : @xmath11 ) .",
    "the qcd factorization theorem provides us with a framework where distinct parameters can be independently studied in order to interpret the experimental results .",
    "prominent among them we find the parton distribution functions which correspond to the momentum distributions of partons inside a proton .",
    "the extraction of the parton distribution function from experimental data and theoretical approach is a complicated task  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties grow with diminishing @xmath2 and are generally very much larger for gluons than for quarks . at the lhc ( large hadron collider )",
    "energies , the gluons will play an important role to understand the new physics . some qcd analysis of parton distribution has been done  @xcite . at this energies ,",
    "one will be able to explore regions of small @xmath2 as shown in table  [ tabla1 ] for minimum bias events .",
    ".[tabla1 ] the @xmath2 values for low @xmath1 production at different energies . the evaluation was done at central rapidity , assuming @xmath12 mev / c .",

    "in order to describe the recoil and sphericity variables and their behavior as function of the parton distribution function of the gluon used , we generated a sample of pythia 6.214 minimum bias events  @xcite .",
    "the generation incorporates some parameters proposed as _ atlas tune _ , based on reference  @xcite .",
    "this tuning parameters were fixed to describe the experimental minimum bias data of ua5 and cdf experiments .",
    "the pseudorapidity and transverse momenta distribution were the first variables fitted in this tuning .",
    "setting from these fits after that , prediction of the properties of minimum bias and underlying event at lhc energy were scaled .",
    "we have used this version of pythia to implant two different parton distribution functions : zeus2005  @xcite and cteq5l  @xcite .",
    "the latter pdf was extracted from a global analysis to several experimental data while the former is extracted only from hera data .",
    "plotting the ratio of the two gluon distribution as we have done in fig .",
    "[ xg ] , we see that at different energies and @xmath13 values they differ substantially , the lowest values of @xmath0 showing the largest difference .    in fig .  [ mean - m ] we show in the top panel the mean multiplicity variation with the sphericity variable obtained at central pseudorapidity .",
    "we observe an interesting dependence on the pdf used : the mean multiplicity at high sphericities is much higher for the cteq5l pdf than for the zeus one .",
    "the phenomenon is the most accentuated in the case of the 10 tev collisions where the @xmath2 value reached is also the smallest . the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ mean - m ] illustrates this fact , it shows the behavior of the ratio of the mean multiplicities for the three cases as a function of sphericity .",
    "the studies displayed here are within the reach of all the lhc experiments , though we have done the simulation for the case of a relatively small acceptance detector which has the capability to detect low charged particle momenta .",
    "we consider only primary tracks within @xmath14 and @xmath15 gev@xmath16c defined according to reference  @xcite . in this context they are the particles produced in the collision , including products of strong and electro - magnetic decays , but excluding feed - down products from strange weak decays and particles produced in secondary interactions .    in fig .",
    "[ thrust ] we show the ratio of the sphericity distributions obtained for the three energies .",
    "one observes that in all cases the difference between the two pdf s increases with growing spherificity but much more so in the case of the 10 tev simulations .",
    "this is due to the smaller @xmath2 in that case , where the differences between the two pdf s are the largest .",
    "the strong slope in case of 10 tev data demonstrate the sensitivity of the approach .",
    "next , the recoil variable is computed according to eq",
    ".  [ ecrecoil ] , the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ratiorecoil ] where a characteristic behavior of the ratio of the mean r values is observed for the 3 energies .",
    "namely , the zeus pdf has a larger momentum inbalance than cteq5l .",
    "we explain the feature by the fact that , due to the smaller rise of the gluon pdf in zeus one is confronted with an emission of particles resulting from collisions of partons of different momenta , while in the case of the more peaky gluon distribution of cteq5l the chance of getting a collision of two partons of similar momentum is more probable , hence resulting in a larger probability that the resulting jets be contained within the acceptance .",
    "the bulk sphericity distributions of several parameters exhibit marked dependence on the gluon pdf used for the computation . as the pdfs for low @xmath2",
    "have a larger uncertainty we believe that the present results point to a possibility to further refine gluon pdfs at low @xmath2 using the approach presented . in the course of this work we have also tried to check the dependence of the parameters on different fragmentation functions used .",
    "the results however do not demonstrate a similar dependence as for the pdfs . as one can expect , varying the fragmentation functions one affects slightly the absolute value of the parameter dependence on sphericity but not the shape .",
    "+ in summary , the sphericity distributions of several parameters are found to be highly sensitive on the details of the gluon pdf .",
    "this opens an interesting possibility to compare the existing gluon pdfs with the experimental results using a small sample of minimum bias data in pp collisions .",
    "the pb pb collisions , we are currently studying  @xcite in the same framework will benefit very much from the present analysis to determine the expected gluon saturation at low @xmath2 .",
