    "during its evolution the universe passed through several phase transitions .",
    "the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts a phase transition in which a hot quark - gluon unconfined phase is converted , as the universe expands and cools , into a confined hadronic phase .",
    "the best quantitative evidence for such transition is found in lattice gauge theory of qcd , which shows that this transition occurred at temperatures around @xmath3 mev @xcite . according to recent results , the phase transition for small chemical potentials ( condition expected at this epoch for standard cosmology and particle models ) is merely an analytic transition ( or crossover ) @xcite .    since the qcd transition occurred before the radiation - matter decoupling , the only way to obtain information about it is possibly through gravitational waves created at this epoch . with the elisa / ngo ( new gravitational wave observatory ) @xcite launch planned for the next years and new detectors being projected , e.g. big bang observatory ( bbo ) and toba @xcite , we expect gravitational radiation to be a new source of information about the qcd transition .",
    "most previous studies on this topic have focused on the effects of a first order transition . in 1984 , witten @xcite considered the possibility that the qcd phase transition may have produced a detectable gravitational wave signal if the transition is first order and leads to violent bubble collisions .",
    "later , applegate and hogan @xcite made a detailed study of the influence of the qcd transition in the standard cosmological model and studied the relics produced at that period .",
    "polnarev @xcite , demonstrated that polarization and anisotropy in the cosmic background radiation can be induced by gravitational waves depending on their characteristic length ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the study of gravitational waves in cosmological phase transitions had a peak in the early 1990s .",
    "based on the assumption of a first order transition , several studies were carried out about the nucleation , growth and collision of bubbles and their relation to the generation of gravitational waves ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a decade later , works on primordial turbulence continued to be conducted .",
    "for example , kosowsky , mack and kahniashvili @xcite calculated the stochastic background of gravitational radiation arising from a period of cosmological turbulence , using a simple model of isotropic kolmogorov turbulence produced in a cosmological phase transition . also , dolgov and grasso @xcite showed that an inhomogeneous cosmological lepton number may have produced turbulence in the primordial plasma when neutrinos entered the ( almost ) free - streaming regime .",
    "this effect may be responsible for the origin of cosmic magnetic fields and give rise to a detectable background of gravitational waves .",
    "more recent works have addressed various possibilities for early - universe physics leading to detectable cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds and have analyzed in more detail the turbulent spectrum as well as the spectrum of the gravitational wave signal @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no studies of turbulence at the qcd epoch assuming a crossover transition and employing a realistic lattice qcd equation of state ( eos ) for the primordial fluid . in the present work , we consider an eos obtained from recent lattice qcd simulations by the wuppertal - budapest collaboration @xcite and perform hydrodynamic numerical simulations in order to obtain the turbulent spectrum as well as the gravitational radiation generated by the motion of the fluid .",
    "the detectability of the inferred background is discussed in the light of the recently published elisa / ngo s sensitivity curve @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : we present firstly the relativistic hydrodynamic equations for a perfect fluid in one dimension and the here - used eos ( sec .",

    "[ sec : conclu ] ) .",
    "to investigate the dynamics and evolution of the primordial fluid , we should solve the equations of hydrodynamics in the context of general relativity .",
    "however , as in previous work @xcite we shall assume a flat space metric filled with a perfect fluid whose stress - energy tensor is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is the specific enthalpy defined as @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the specific internal energy and @xmath9 is the mass density in the rest frame .    in the one - dimensional case adopted here , the hydrodynamic equations written in covariant form consist of three local conservation laws for the above stress - energy tensor @xmath10 and the baryon density flow @xmath11 : @xmath12 where we used units in which the speed of light is @xmath13 .",
    "the system must be complemented with an equation of state having the functional form @xmath14 .      in order to construct the eos for a crossover transition we considered the most recent results of lattice qcd simulations obtained by the wuppertal - budapest collaboration ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , with @xmath15 , i.e. two light ( up and down ) and one heavy ( strange ) quarks . to adapt such eos to the conditions prevailing at the qcd epoch in the early universe we added the contribution of a gas of non - interacting neutrinos ( @xmath16 ) , muons , electrons , photons and their antiparticles , all them described by an eos of the form @xmath17 with @xmath18 . as showed in ref .",
    "@xcite the addition of the charm or heavier quarks does nt introduce any substantial modification in the temperature regime relevant for this work .",
    "such data generate smooth curves for several observables which are typical of a crossover transition . in fig .",

    "finally , we have to consider the redshift suffered by the waves in their way to the present universe @xcite : @xmath76 where the subscript @xmath77 corresponds to present values and the subscript @xmath78 to the values at the epoch of the transition .",
    "since we are considering a crossover transition at the qcd epoch , we do nt expect large perturbations near the critical temperature as it would be the case for a first order transition .",
    "thus , we assume that fluctuations present at the qcd epoch were generated by some event in the previous history of the universe , e.g. at the electroweak phase transition that occurred at @xmath79 .",
    "hence , one may consider that the size of the larger fluctuations at the qcd era are of the order of the size of the horizon at the electroweak era ; i.e. we have @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , the injection of energy happens at the electroweak scale ( @xmath81 m ) or at an even smaller scale related to inflation , ) during the radiation era .",
    "for example , large drops in the number of relativistic particles during a qcd transition would lead to steps in the spectrum of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the study of such reprocessing of the inflationary background during the qcd epoch is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , it is necessary to properly understand and disentangle the all post - inflationary effects @xcite , like the here studied qcd transition , in order to optimally extract the inflationary information in the stochastic gravitational wave background . ] cosmic strings , etc . @xcite .",
    "this fluctuations are conjectured to survive until the beginning of the qcd phase transition due to the extremely large reynolds number of the primordial fluid @xcite .    in turbulent fluids , we usually have a large stirring length scale @xmath82 at which turbulent eddies are injected in the fluid .",
    "as said above , we are assuming that large fluctuations occur at ( or before ) the electroweak era and therefore , the stirring scale is @xmath83 .",
    "as the larger eddies break down to smaller ones , there is a cascade of kinetic energy from large to small scales .",
    "this cascade effect will stop at a small damping length scale @xmath84 determined by the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "roughly , the damping scale is determined by a reynolds number close to 1 , @xmath85 .",
    "thus we can estimate the order of magnitude of the damping scale as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and @xmath88 its typical velocity .",
    "the shear viscosity @xmath89 of matter at the qcd epoch can be derived from heavy - ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "in fact , these experiments show that the quark - gluon plasma at temperatures @xmath90 behaves as a nearly perfect quark - gluon liquid with a viscosity per entropy density in the range @xmath91 @xcite , i.e. approaching the kovtun - policastro - son - starinets lower bound @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "since the baryon chemical potential and temperature of the rhic / lhc fluid are not exceedingly different to what it is expected at the early universe we may assume that the primordial fluid at the qcd transition behaves as a perfect fluid as well . according to this",
    ", we would have @xmath93 which is 14 orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the cell in our numerical simulations , which is @xmath94 .",
    "however , the contribution of leptons and photons to the viscosity may be significant .",
    "in fact , theoretical estimations @xcite of the viscosity of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the early universe give values that are roughly one order of magnitude larger than the experimental values obtained at rhic and lhc .",
    "the viscosity may be up to three orders of magnitude larger if electrons , muons and photons are included in the qgp , and even eight orders of magnitude larger if neutrinos are considered @xcite . in spite of this , the viscosity is still very small and the reynolds number very large , as generally considered in the literature . actually , when the most viscous composition is considered , the damping length scale is @xmath95 m , which is still orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the cell in our numerical simulations . therefore , the use of the ideal hydrodynamic equations presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : hidro ] is fully justified .    up to now",
    ", most works studying the qcd transition have considered that the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy density has a stationary spectrum consistent with the kolmogorov phenomenology @xcite , i.e. scaling as @xmath96 or variations of this @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is very frequent in astrophysical environments , like the interplanetary , interstellar or intergalactic medium , which have a significant viscosity and a constant injection of energy at the large scales ( induced e.g. by solar flares , supernovae , etc . ) .",
    "this energy is transferred to small scales through a cascading effect until @xmath97 , where kinetic energy is dissipated into heat due to the fluid viscosity , resulting a spectrum with a negative slope . in the cosmological case",
    ", the assumption of a kolmogorov - like spectrum may be acceptable when there is a continuous injection of energy , as in the case of a first order phase transition , for which bubble collisions introduce a continuous stirring",
    ". however , this stirring is not present in a crossover transition , and therefore the assumption of a kolmogorov spectrum is unjustified .",
    "moreover , since the viscosity of the primordial fluid is tiny , dissipation at small scales does not occur at the same rate as the energy is accumulated by cascading .",
    "therefore , a very different turbulent spectrum is to be expected .",
    "we have carried out relativistic one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for an ideal non - viscous fluid employing the fluid equations and eos of sec . [",
    "sec : hidro ] .",
    "we consider a computational domain with a length of 100 m , with 16.384 spatial cells ( @xmath98 ) and evolve the system for times larger than @xmath99 .",
    "the choice of these intervals is related to the band of the spectrum of gravitational waves that we want to obtain from the numerical simulations , i.e. @xmath100 hz according to the elisa s sensitivity curve ( see below ) .",
    "we consider reflective boundary conditions , so that we may see the universe as a set of various contiguous domains of 100 m. due to choice of the boundary conditions , disturbances are reflected several times during the simulation , representing the fluid interaction with neighboring regions having similar profiles . in agreement with the above discussion , turbulence is included only through inhomogeneities in the initial condition .",
    "we have considered three different kinds of random initial profiles : ( a ) random temperature inhomogeneities in a fluid at rest , ( b ) random velocity fluctuations within a fluid with an initial uniform temperature , and ( c ) random temperature and velocity fluctuations . since the size of possible disturbances at the time of the transition is unknown we consider fluctuations of maximum amplitude @xmath101 around @xmath102 mev and/or @xmath103 in the initial profile .",
    "our goal is to determine the smallest fluctuation amplitude that would be detected by elisa , considering the motion of the fluid induced by the initial condition as a source of gravitational radiation .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations provide the tensor @xmath104 from which we obtain @xmath105 through a fft .",
    "this allows the calculation of the spectrum of the gravitational radiation emitted by the fluid through eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalgw ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_t ] we consider random temperature inhomogeneities with a maximum amplitude of @xmath106 in a fluid that is initially at rest .",
    "the initial temperature profile ( top panel ) presents peaks and valleys of different sizes .",
    "as the fluid evolves , these temperature gradients induce the motion of the fluid , temperature inhomogeneities are smoothed ( see central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_t ] ) , and the fluid develops a turbulent motion with velocities up to @xmath107 . as discussed before , there is a cascading that transports kinetic energy to the smallest scales where there is no dissipation due to the absence of viscosity .",
    "this behavior is apparent in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_t ] , which shows that a large amount of kinetic energy is accumulated at the smallest scales ( large @xmath108 ) at the end of the simulation .",
    "we performed similar simulations with random temperature inhomogeneities with a maximum amplitude of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution is not shown here because the behavior is qualitatively the same .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : randomt ] we can see a comparison between the gravitational wave spectra arising from the three initial temperature gradients considered here . in the case with @xmath111 the signal would be detected by elisa for a wide range of frequencies .",
    "for the simulation with @xmath112 the signal is entirely below but not too far from the elisa s threshold .",
    "in fact , we can show that the signal for fluctuations of about @xmath113 is partially overlapping the elisa s sensitivity curve .",
    "fluctuations with @xmath114 do nt lead to enough motion in the fluid to emit a significant amount of gravitational radiation .",
    "we also considered an initial condition with constant temperature @xmath115 mev and a random velocity distribution .",
    "for an initial maximum amplitude of @xmath116 ( see top panel of fig . [",
    "fig : cond_v ] ) the turbulent motion creates temperature gradients of the order of @xmath117 which at the end of simulation fall to about @xmath118 with maximum velocities roughly the half of the initial ( see central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_v ] ) . on the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_v ] , we show the initial and final velocity spectra , which present the same behavior as in the previous simulations , confirming the expectation that the spectra must be very different to the kolmogorov power law . for maximum initial velocities of @xmath119 ,",
    "the induced temperature gradients are an order of magnitude larger than in the previous case and the strong motion of the fluid leads to a large amount of gravitational radiation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : randomv ] ) .",
    "notice that the spectrum with @xmath120 is almost overlapping the elisa sensitivity curve for frequencies larger that @xmath110 hz as in the simulation with initial condition @xmath121 , @xmath122 . in spite of these initial conditions being very different",
    ", the system evolves in both cases to similar temperature and velocity profiles in a timescale considerably smaller than the total time of the simulation .",
    "in fact , simulations with concomitant velocity and temperature gradients in the initial condition give essentially the same results as before , i.e. a progressive homogenization of both the temperature and velocity profiles , an energy cascade to the smaller scales , and a gravitational wave spectrum with a peak around @xmath110 hz ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_cond_tv]@xmath50[fig : randomtv ] ) .",
    "this peak in the spectrum is due to an exponential decay of the fluid velocity .",
    "actually , we verified that @xmath123 with @xmath124s for most values of the wave number @xmath108 , showing that most of the fluid motion happens within this time interval . since gravitational wave emission",
    "is associated with the level of turbulent motion in the fluid , we expect a maximum in the spectrum at a frequency @xmath125 , which from eq .",
    "( [ eq : freq_today ] ) turns out to be @xmath2 hz ; i.e. consistent with the maximum in the spectra of figs .",
    "[ fig : randomt ] , [ fig : randomv ] and [ fig : randomtv ] .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the evolution of primordial turbulence in the universe at the qcd epoch using a state - of - the - art equation of state derived from lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "since the transition is a crossover , we do nt expect large perturbations near the critical temperature as it would be the case for a first order transition .",
    "thus , we assume that temperature and velocity fluctuations were generated by some event in the previous history of the universe ( e.g. a first order transition at the electroweak scale or at an even smaller scale related to inflation , cosmic strings , etc . ) with typical sizes smaller than the size of the horizon at the electroweak era , @xmath83 . due to the extremely large reynolds number of the primordial fluid we consider that these inhomogeneities are able to survive until the qcd epoch .",
    "the primordial fluid at the qcd epoch is assumed to be non - viscous , based on the fact that the viscosity per entropy density of the quark gluon plasma obtained from heavy - ion collision experiments at the rhic and the lhc is extremely small , more specifically , in the range @xmath91 at temperatures @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "for the hydrodynamic simulations , we considered a one dimensional computational domain with a length of 100 m divided in @xmath98 cells , injected random temperature and velocity fluctuations in the initial conditions , and evolved the system for times larger than @xmath99 .",
    "our results show that the velocity spectrum is very different from the kolmogorov power law considered in most studies of primordial turbulence that focus on first order transitions .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is no continuous injection of energy in the system and the viscosity of the fluid is negligible .",
    "thus , as kinetic energy cascades from the larger to the smaller scales , a large amount of kinetic energy is accumulated at the smallest scales due to the lack of dissipation ( see bottom panels of figs . [",
