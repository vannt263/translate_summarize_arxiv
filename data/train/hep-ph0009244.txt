    "<S> november 2000    and    exclusive nonleptonic decays of @xmath3 mesons have received a lot of attention since they are observed in experiments at cleo , babar and belle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they offer the opportunity to test the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) triangle , the cp violation and to observe new physics effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantitative understanding of nonleptonic decays of @xmath3 mesons is difficult since there are final - state interactions which are intrinsically nonperturbative in nature . </S>",
    "<S> but when a @xmath3 meson decays into two light mesons , there is large momentum transfer to final - state mesons . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we can systematically calculate the decay rates using perturbation theory in the heavy quark limit .    </S>",
    "<S> beneke et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite considered general two - body nonleptonic decays of @xmath3 mesons extensively including a light - light meson system as well as a heavy - light system in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> the general idea is that in the limit @xmath4 , the hadronic matrix elements can be schematically represented as @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are final - state mesons and @xmath8 is a local current - current operator in the weak effective hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> if we neglect radiative corrections in @xmath1 and power corrections in @xmath9 , we get the factorized result with a form factor times a decay constant . at higher order in @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> this simple factorization is broken , but the corrections can be calculated systematically in terms of short - distance wilson coefficients and meson light - cone distribution amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we call this the qcd - improved factorization .    </S>",
    "<S> when we use light - cone meson wave functions for exclusive decays , the transition amplitude of an operator @xmath10 in the weak effective hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the form factors for @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the light - cone wave function for the meson @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 and @xmath17 are hard - scattering amplitudes , which are perturbatively calculable . the second term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ imqcd ] ) represents spectator contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> this method works well for the case with two light mesons like @xmath18 or @xmath19 @xcite , in which the final - state mesons carry large momenta . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , when there is a heavy quark in the final state such as @xmath20 , this method still works when a spectator quark of the @xmath3 meson is absorbed by , say , a @xmath21 meson @xcite . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , they calculated the ratio @xmath22 or @xmath23 since the wilson coefficients were known at leading order at the time . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute branching ratios for @xmath24 were calculated recently since the wilson coefficients are known at next - to - leading order accuracy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the spectator quark is absorbed by a light quark , say , in @xmath25 , nonfactorizable contributions are infrared divergent , and the factorization breaks down .    when we consider the decay @xmath26 , it looks ambiguous at first sight whether we can apply the same method used in @xmath27 , or @xmath20 , since the spectator quark in the @xmath3 meson goes into a light @xmath28 meson . </S>",
    "<S> however , what is special about @xmath29 is that the size of the charmonium is so small ( @xmath30 ) that the charmonium has a negligible overlap with the ( @xmath31 , @xmath28 ) system , hence enabling the same improved factorization method in the decay @xmath32 . as the explicit calculation shows below , the nonfactorizable contribution is infrared safe and the spectator contribution is suppressed in the heavy quark limit . </S>",
    "<S> these facts indirectly justify the use of the improved factorization formula eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ imqcd ] ) in @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> when the mass of the @xmath29 meson is not negligible , the light - cone wave function of the @xmath29 meson should include higher - twist contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the light - cone wave functions are obtained in powers of @xmath34 or @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the energy of the @xmath29 meson . for @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> decays into two light mesons , the higher - twist contributions are negligible since they are of order @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath38 , higher - twist contributions are important </S>",
    "<S> . therefore we expect that the decay rate using only the leading , asymptotic wave function of @xmath29 will be smaller than the experimental result .    due to the nonzero mass of @xmath29 , we can think of several approximations with different limits . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we can take the infinite mass limit of the @xmath39 quark in which @xmath40 goes to infinity while @xmath41 is fixed ( @xmath42 ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the result simply reduces to the case of @xmath43 . but this limit is hardly realized in nature and it is not reasonable to compare the theoretical prediction in this limit with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we can consider another limit in which @xmath40 goes to infinity , while @xmath44 is held fixed . in this case , if @xmath41 is heavy enough , it would be a better idea to employ a nonrelativistic wave function for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can still use the light - cone wave function for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> but we have to include the effects of higher - twist wave functions in order to compare with experimental data reasonably since these effects can be appreciable .    from now on , we assume that , in the limit in which @xmath40 goes to infinity , @xmath41 is heavy enough to regard the size of the @xmath29 meson as small , but light enough to employ the leading - twist light - cone wave function for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to satisfy this interesting , but hypothetical limit in reality , but we will not go further into the detail about this point . in this paper , we present the decay amplitude at next - to - leading order in the strong interaction , neglecting @xmath45 corrections , employing the same technique to @xmath33 as in @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> one technical point is that we will keep the mass @xmath41 of the @xmath29 meson in the hard scattering amplitude . in order for this to be theoretically consistent </S>",
    "<S> , we also have to consider the higher - twist wave functions for @xmath29 since higher - twist wave functions contain corrections of order @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the main issue is whether the hard - scattering amplitudes in the heavy quark limit are infrared finite at each order in @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the higher - twist wave functions correspond to the expansion in @xmath2 , and each wave function is , in general , an independent function . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we have to verify that the hard - scattering amplitude convoluted with each independent wave function is finite . </S>",
    "<S> what we pursue in this paper is whether the hard - scattering amplitude convoluted with the leading - twist wave function for @xmath29 can be reliably calculated in the heavy quark limit . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of higher - twist wave functions to compare with experimental data will be considered elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian @xmath46 for @xmath47 is written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the wilson coefficients at next - to - leading order evaluated at the renormalization scale @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant operators in @xmath46 are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the color indices and the sum over @xmath54 runs over @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath39 .    in calculating the decay amplitude , we introduce the vector and the tensor decay constants as @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the decay constant which can be determined from the leptonic decay of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 is the tensor decay constant arising from the tensor current , which formally depends on the renormalization scale .    </S>",

    "<S> the asymptotic form of the distribution amplitudes @xmath67 and @xmath65 is the same , given as @xmath68 . in the numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we also consider the wave function of the form @xmath69 , which appeals to the intuitive expectation of the wave function .    </S>",
    "<S> if we neglect the radiative corrections and the power corrections in @xmath70 , the factorized amplitude at leading order is written as @xmath71 we do not include the effects of the electroweak penguin operators since they are numerically small . here @xmath72 is the number of colors , @xmath41 is the mass of @xmath29 , and @xmath73 is the polarization vector of @xmath29 . </S>",

    "<S> . therefore this amplitude is unphysical . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we include the @xmath1 correction to the amplitudes , it turns out that the @xmath50 dependence of the wilson coefficients is cancelled and the overall amplitude is insensitive to the renormalization scale .    </S>",

    "<S> the branching ratio from experiment is given by @xcite @xmath148 our result shows that , for @xmath149 , the branching ratio is @xmath150 for @xmath145 and @xmath151 for @xmath152 , which are about eight times smaller than the experimental result . </S>",
    "<S> though the theoretical treatment of the qcd - improved factorization in @xmath26 is improved , the theoretical result still does not saturate the experimental result . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected since we do not include higher - twist effects which are supposed to be rather appreciable . in order to have a reasonable comparison , we need to include higher - twist effects , which is going to be pursued elsewhere .    0.5 cm    in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig3 ] , the dependence of the branching ratio on the renormalization scale is shown . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal short - dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] show the experimental branching ratio at @xmath153 level . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the factorized result without nonfactorizable contribution . of course , this quantity is unphysical and very sensitive to the renormalization scale , as we can see clearly in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . on the other hand , for the full branching ratio calculated at next - to - leading order </S>",
    "<S> , the dependence of the branching ratio on the renormalization scale is very mild .    </S>",
    "<S> recent observation of cp asymmetry in @xmath154 @xcite attracted some interests in the possibility of new physics @xcite . in this scheme in the standard model </S>",
    "<S> , there is no contribution to cp asymmetry in the decay amplitude since the ckm matrix elements involved here are all real . </S>",
    "<S> the cp asymmetry totally comes from @xmath155 mixing , and we have not considered this issue here .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have considered the effect of nonfactorizable contributions in @xmath33 in the heavy quark limit . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> , nonfactorizable contribution can be systematically calculated from first principles using perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the decay amplitude is factorizable at next - to - leading order in the strong interaction and at leading order in @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the nonfactorizable contribution and the spectator contribution are infrared finite .    in general , when the @xmath3 meson decays into two mesons in which one is heavy , </S>",
    "<S> if the spectator quark of the @xmath3 meson goes into the light meson , the decay amplitude is not factorizable . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap of the heavy meson with the remainder is sizable and the soft gluon exchange gives a significant effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the heavy meson is the charmonium , the factorization method still works at leading - twist order . </S>",
    "<S> this physically means that the size of the charmonium is so small that the overlap with other mesons is small . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the qcd - improved factorization method holds in @xmath33 , in contrast to naive expectations .    in spite of the theoretical improvement mentioned so far , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical branching ratio is about eight times smaller than the experimental result . </S>",
    "<S> this is typical in class ii decays in which there is color suppression in the lowest order contribution . and </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 corrections give a significant change in magnitude and a significant strong phase compared to the leading - order result corresponding to naive factorization .    </S>",
    "<S> another reason why the theoretical result is small compared to the experimental data is that we used only the leading - twist wave functions . in a realistic case , </S>",
    "<S> higher - twist effects are not negligible . </S>",
    "<S> khodjamirian and rckl @xcite considered nonperturbative effects in @xmath0 using the qcd sum rules , and they found that nonperturbative effects including the higher - twist wave functions could indeed be large . </S>",
    "<S> also in the inclusive production of @xmath29 , the naive factorization does not explain the large production rate . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested that the octet contribution would enhance the rate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution comes from the nonleading fock state @xmath156 state , which constitutes higher - twist effects , and it may not be negligible in the decay @xmath33 either . however , the method of the qcd - improved factorization can be safely applied to @xmath33 at leading - twist order and it is remarkable that we obtain a very significant correction to naive factorization .    * note added * : while this paper has been written , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite appeared , in which the decay amplitude for @xmath157 are computed including chirally enhanced contributions . </S>",
    "<S> their result looks different from ours , but the definition of @xmath111 and @xmath158 are rather ambiguous since they can be switched back and forth using the equation of motion discussed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , they put @xmath159 using the equation of motion . </S>",
    "<S> that is why there is no @xmath61 in their result . </S>",
    "<S> however , when all is taken into account , both results are the same . </S>"
