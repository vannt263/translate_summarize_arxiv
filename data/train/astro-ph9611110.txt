    "in understanding the universe , it has been one of central issues to determine the cosmological parameters ; the density parameter @xmath0 and the cosmological constant @xmath1 ( weinberg 1972 ; peebles 1993 ) .",
    "although some cosmological tests have been proposed and applied , the conclusive result has not been obtained yet . the difficulties in determining the cosmological parameters consist in the following fact :",
    "all cosmological tests are based on the fact that relations among observables depend on the cosmological parameters .",
    "however , the relations also rely on astrophysical models .",
    "for instance , the galaxy - number count is significantly affected by the formation and evolution of galaxies ( yoshii and takahara 1988 ; fukugita , takahara , yamashita and yoshii 1990 ) , and the statistics of multiple images of quasars due to the gravitational lensing depends greatly on the lens model of galaxies and cluster of galaxies ( flores and primack 1996 ; kochanek 1996 ) .    the method to determine the",
    "deceleration parameter @xmath3 , taking type ia supernovae ( snia ) as the standard candle , has been proposed .",
    "recently , it became possible to apply the method to observational data , because of a progress of the search for high redshift snia ( perlmutter et.al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; references therein ) .",
    "this method makes use of the dependence of the luminosity distance - redshift relation on cosmological parameters .",
    "it is assumed that the mean absolute magnitude of snia is constant over various redshifts .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of magnitude of snia can be taken into account in the statistical sense .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that the gravitational lensing effect due to inhomogeneities of the universe disturbs this test , which has recently been investigated by several authors using various approaches ( kantowski , voughan and branch 1995 ; wambsganss et.al .",
    "1996 ; frieman 1996 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the angular diameter distance - redshift relation also depends on cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , it is possible to determine cosmological parameters through the dependence , if one can measure the redshift and the apparent size of an object whose physical size is known by another independent method .",
    "b. fort , y. mellier and m. dantel - fort have taken notice of the relation between the mass of the gravitational lens ( cluster of galaxies ) and the location of the critical line ( fort , mellier and dantel - fort 1996 ; hereafter fmd ) . using the data of cluster of galaxies",
    "cl0024 + 1654 , they obtained a constraint @xmath2 , as a preliminary result .",
    "their procedure is as follows ( see section 2 for more details ) : from the observation of a lens object ( which is nearly axisymmetric along a line of sight ) and background galaxies , one can determine the velocity dispersion , the angular core radius and the maximum angular radius of critical lines . in particular , the critical line , defined as the location where large amplification of images occurs ( schneider , ehlers and falco 1992 , hereafter sef ) , can be determined observationally as the location where the number density of background galaxies is much larger than that in the field ( fmd ) .",
    "the location of the critical line depends not only on the mass distribution of the lens but also on the ratio between two distances ; the angular diameter distance from the lens to the source and that from the observer to the source .",
    "the mass distribution of the lens is usually estimated from the velocity dispersion and the core radius .",
    "when the redshift of the source is between 3 and 5 , the distance ratio depends strongly on the cosmological parameters but is insensitive to the redshift of the source .",
    "thus the cosmological parameters can be determined by this dependence .",
    "fmd have studied the case of the spatially flat universe .",
    "however , it is still important to investigate , without assuming the spatially flat universe , how @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be really constrained by this method . moreover , the inhomogeneities of the universe may disturb this test by bringing uncertainties to the angular diameter distance - redshift relation .",
    "we also investigate this effect by using the dyer - roeder ( dr ) angular diameter distance ( dyer and roeder 1972 , 1974;hereafter dr ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the method by fmd is explained . in section 3",
    ", we consider cases of general @xmath0 and @xmath1 in order to investigate how accurately @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be determined by this method . in section 4 ,",
    "the dr angular diameter distance is used in order to take into consideration the effect of clumpiness of the universe . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss how @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be constrained in the clumpy universe .",
    "we also mention the uncertainty of the determination of the velocity dispersion .",
    "section 6 is devoted to summary .",
    "in this section , we would like to summarize the method to determine the cosmological parameters by the use of the maximum radius of the critical lines in the gravitational lens .",
    "it is assumed that the mass profile of the cluster of galaxies is that of the isothermal sphere with core ( fmd ) .",
    "then the mass profile of the cluster is written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a core radius , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "the surface mass density projected to the lens plane is useful in investigating gravitational lensing and obtained from eq.([densityiso ] ) as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a radius from the center of the cluster on the lens plane .",
    "the mass within the radius @xmath9 on the lens plane is expressed as @xmath10 in the spherically symmetric case such as the isothermal sphere , the critical line appears on the einstein ring ( sef ) ; @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the angular radius of the critical line and that of the einstein ring , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the angular diameter distances between the observer and the lens , between the observer and the source , and between the lens and the source , respectively . in the case of isothermal sphere",
    ", we may use eq.@xmath17 to obtain @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radius of the critical line .",
    "it should be noted that the observable is not the radius of the critical line but its angular radius , @xmath20 . from eq.(@xmath21 ) , we obtain the important ratio ( fmd ) , which depends only on the observables , @xmath22 where we defined @xmath23 . usually , the radius of the critical line ( several tens arcsec , several mpc ) is much larger than the core radius ( less than mpc ) .",
    "then we can use the approximate relation @xmath24    it is noteworthy that the angular diameter distance has not been specified .",
    "since the angular radius of the critical line @xmath12 , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the cluster @xmath7 and the angular core radius @xmath25 can be obtained observationally , the ratio @xmath26 can be determined from these data . on the other hand ,",
    "the distance ratio @xmath26 as well as the angular diameter distances , @xmath16 and @xmath15 , depends on the cosmological models .",
    "for instance , in the flrw universe , the relation between the redshift and the distance ratio depends only on the cosmological parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( weinberg 1972 ; peebles 1993 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows how the relation between the distance ratio @xmath26 and the redshift of the source depends on the cosmological parameters , where we assume the angular diameter distance in the flrw universe .",
    "it also shows that @xmath27 increases with the redshift of the source .",
    "it should be noted in fig.1 that @xmath26 is sensitive to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but insensitive to the redshift of the source from 3 to 5 .",
    "therefore , if one obtains observationally the maximum of @xmath27 , the cosmological parameters can be constrained without the precise measurement of redshift of background faint galaxies ( fmd ) . in order to constrain the cosmological parameters , it is necessary to obtain @xmath26 within about ten percent accuracy , for cl0024 + 1654 at @xmath28 , as shown by fig.1 .    from eq.(@xmath29 ) , it is clear that the cosmological test discussed here relies on ( 1 ) which angular diameter distance to be used and ( 2 ) the mass of the cluster as the gravitational lens .",
    "we mainly investigate the effect of the first aspect on the cosmological test .",
    "in particular , we pay much attention to the distance ratio @xmath26 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the cosmological test discussed here does not depend on the hubble constant because of our using only the distance ratio @xmath26 .",
    "in the previous section , we have given fig.1 , which shows a relation among @xmath30 , @xmath26 and cosmological parameters , by assuming @xmath31 . in the remaining of this paper , we fix the redshift of the source at @xmath32 in order to make our discussion clear .",
    "this treatment is plausible in practice , since @xmath26 is insensitive to the redshift of the source for @xmath33 , as shown by fig.1 .",
    "figure 2 shows relations between @xmath0 and @xmath26 in two cases of @xmath31 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is found that a bound on @xmath1 can be obtained in the case of @xmath31 , particularly for large @xmath26 .",
    "remarkably , @xmath26 depends very weakly on @xmath0 when @xmath34 . however , it is not clear whether @xmath26 is generally insensitive to @xmath0",
    ". thus we investigate the dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in order to investigate a relation among @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath26 , we plot contours of @xmath26 on @xmath0-@xmath1 plane assuming @xmath35 , as shown by fig.3 .",
    "figure 3 shows clearly that @xmath26 is very insensitive to @xmath0 regardless of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to determine @xmath0 by this method .",
    "however , when we assume the spatially flat universe , one can put a bound on the cosmological constant , as fmd discussed .",
    "we use fig.3 , in order to illustrate how we can constrain the cosmological constant for a given @xmath26 assuming @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , @xmath36 would suggest a universe dominated by the cosmological constant ( @xmath37 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath26 is less than @xmath38 , the vanishing cosmological constant is preferred .",
    "figs.4(a)-(c ) show contours of @xmath26 on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane in the cases of @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "these suggest that , regardless of the redshift of the lens , @xmath26 depends very weakly on @xmath0 , but is more sensitive to @xmath1 in a lower density universe .",
    "thus , one may constrain the cosmological constant by using the lens at various redshifts as well . however , as shown by fig.4(a ) , the cosmological constant does not change @xmath26 so much for a low redshift lens , that one must use a lens at a moderately high redshift ( @xmath41 ) for this cosmological test .",
    "it is important to note the difference between the new method and the so - called @xmath3 test ; the new method is more sensitive to @xmath1 than to @xmath0 , while the @xmath3 test aims at the determination of the combination @xmath42 in the matter - dominated universe ( weinberg 1972 ; peebles 1993 ) .",
    "on a sufficiently large scale , our universe can be described by the flrw universe .",
    "nevertheless , the light ray propagates from the source to the observer according to the geodesic equation which is determined by the local metric along the light ray ( weinberg 1972 ; peebles 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the light propagation is affected by the inhomogeneities of the universe .",
    "much attention has focused on the effect of the inhomogeneities on the luminosity or angular diameter distance between the observer and the source , @xmath15 ( dr ; futamase and sasaki 1989 ; kasai , futamase and takahara 1990 ; sef ; sasaki 1993 ) .",
    "thus , here we must consider how much the inhomogeneities affect the ratio of angular diameter distances @xmath26 .",
    "we consider the dr angular diameter distance , for its simplicity , in order to take into account the inhomogeneities ( dr ; sef ) .",
    "the dr angular diameter distance is determined by @xmath43 where the parameter @xmath44 represents the clumpiness along the light ray . in the flrw universe , @xmath44 is unity , while @xmath44 vanishes when the light ray propagates through the empty space . in this paper , we consider @xmath45 , since we have little knowledge of @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath46 is an affine parameter , which is assumed ( sef ) to be given by that in the flrw universe @xmath47 it is noteworthy that the coefficient of the last term of eq.(@xmath48 ) , @xmath49 , comes from the ricci focusing by the clumpy matter and , therefore , the dr angular diameter distance is a decreasing function of @xmath44 for a fixed redshift ( dr ; sef ) .",
    "since we have considered the flrw universe ( @xmath50 ) in the previous section , here we consider the other limiting case @xmath51 in order to investigate the effect of clumpiness of the universe .      by solving eq.(@xmath48 ) numerically , we can obtain the angular diameter distances @xmath16 and @xmath15 . as a result ,",
    "we draw fig.5 which shows relations between @xmath0 and @xmath26 in two cases of @xmath31 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is found that , in the clumpy universe , the distance ratio @xmath26 is smaller than that in the case of @xmath50 . in particular for a higher density universe ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath44 is larger in both cases ; @xmath31 and @xmath34 .",
    "next , we draw contours of @xmath26 on @xmath0-@xmath1 plane in fig.6 , in order to clarify the dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the clumpy universe . by comparing fig.6 with figs.3 and 4",
    ", we find that , in the universe with any @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath26 for @xmath51 is smaller than that for @xmath50 . for any @xmath1",
    ", we also find that the discrepancy of @xmath26 between @xmath51 and @xmath52 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact that the focusing effect due to the clumpiness in eq.(@xmath48 ) increases with @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , fig.6 implies that , for @xmath51 , @xmath26 is very sensitive to @xmath0 rather than to @xmath1 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of @xmath50 .",
    "we will show an important property of @xmath26 in the next subsection , before we will discuss in section 5 how one can constrain the cosmological parameters by taking into account the effect due to the clumpy universe .",
    "in the above , we have only considered two limiting cases of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in figs.2 and 5 ,",
    "the following interesting property of the distance ratio appears @xmath53    by noticing that @xmath44 enhances monotonically the ricci focusing in eq.(@xmath48 ) , one expects that eq.@xmath54 is generalized to a relation for @xmath55 as @xmath56 this is proved as follows : let us fix the redshift of the source and the cosmological parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "then we define a function of @xmath57 parameterized by @xmath44 as @xmath58 from eq.@xmath59 , we obtain the equation for @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an affine parameter at the lens .",
    "we define the wronskian as @xmath63 using eq.@xmath64 , we obtain @xmath65 where we used @xmath55 .",
    "since both @xmath66 and @xmath67 vanish at @xmath68 , we obtain @xmath69 from eqs.@xmath70 and @xmath71 , we find @xmath72 where we used the fact that the affine parameter @xmath46 defined by eq.@xmath73 is an increasing function of @xmath74 .",
    "eq.(@xmath75 ) is rewritten as @xmath76 since @xmath77 always becomes unity at the observer , we find @xmath78 from eqs.@xmath79 and @xmath80 , we find @xmath81 this gives us what we wish to prove .",
    "it should be noted that eq.(@xmath82 ) holds even if one uses the opposite sign in the definition of the affine parameter in eq.@xmath73 .",
    "eq.(@xmath83 ) means that the distance ratio @xmath27 for @xmath84 takes a value between those for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , namely for @xmath84 , @xmath85 therefore , all we have to do is to investigate two limiting cases @xmath51 and @xmath52 , in order to know a region where @xmath27 for @xmath86 takes its value for given @xmath57 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "eq.(@xmath87 ) shows that , for the light propagation through a lower density region such as a void , the distance ratio @xmath27 is always less than that in the flrw universe .",
    "we have used the dr angular diameter distance , in order to investigate how much the clumpy universe affects the determination of the cosmological parameters by the method using the location of the critical lines in the gravitational lens .",
    "it is shown in section 4 that the distance ratio @xmath26 in a clumpy universe is necessarily less than that in the flrw universe .",
    "it is also shown that the distance ratio @xmath27 in a higher density universe is more affected by the clumpiness . as a result , it seems impossible that the cosmological parameters can be clearly determined by this method .",
    "this situation may remind us of the recent discussion about the @xmath3 test using the luminosity distance - redshift relation , where about fifty - percent deviation can happen in the swiss cheese model of the universe ( kantowski , vaughan and branch 1995 ) .    nevertheless , there are some cases where the cosmological parameters can be constrained by noticing that the clumpiness always decreases @xmath26 . in order to illustrate these cases , we use figs.3 and 6(c ) ( @xmath35 ) , assuming two cosmological models with ( 1 ) @xmath31 and ( 2 ) @xmath34 .",
    "first , we consider the case of ( 1 ) @xmath31 : in the case of @xmath26 between 0.67 and 0.85 , one can put a bound on @xmath1 , though the bound is sensitive to @xmath44 .",
    "the allowed region of @xmath1 becomes wide as @xmath26 decreases .",
    "if @xmath26 is between 0.53 and 0.67 , an upper bound on @xmath1 can be obtained , which is given by @xmath51 .",
    "next , we use the case of ( 2 ) @xmath34 : in the case of @xmath88 , one can put a lower bound on @xmath0 , which is given by @xmath50 .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath0 must be greater than unity if @xmath26 exceeds @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath26 is less than 0.63 , one can also put a lower bound on @xmath0 , which is given by @xmath51 . in the above",
    ", we assumed either @xmath31 or @xmath34 a priori .",
    "however , even without such a constraint , the allowed region of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 is still bounded by two limiting cases ; @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( for instance , see two curves for @xmath89 in fig.6(c ) ) .",
    "it is important to mention that a lower bound on @xmath1 , given by using the angular diameter distance in the flrw universe ( @xmath50 ) , is not affected by the clumpiness .",
    "thus , @xmath90 given by fmd can not be relaxed by taking into account the clumpiness of the universe . here , it should be noted that the cosmological constant may be well constrained by this method , if the density parameter can be determined by another method .    in the above ,",
    "we have considered only the dependence of @xmath26 on the cosmological parameters . here",
    ", we briefly mention the dependence of this test on astrophysical models of the cluster of galaxies .",
    "as shown in eq.@xmath91 , the precise determination of the velocity dispersion is necessary even if one assumes the isothermal sphere as the lens .",
    "if one specifies the redshifts of the lens and the source , the accuracy required for the determination of the velocity dispersion depends on which cosmological models we wish to compare with . if one wishes to distinguish , for instance , the cosmological model with @xmath92 from that with @xmath93 , one must distinguish @xmath94 from @xmath95 for @xmath35 and @xmath32 .",
    "this means that one must discriminate the difference of @xmath26 at worst by 16 percent .",
    "however , the statistical error of the velocity dispersion is at least about ten percent because of the limited number(about a hundred ) of galaxies inside the radius of the critical line , even though the velocity of individual galaxies can be measured precisely ( dressler , gunn and schneider 1985 ) .",
    "this required accuracy is almost unchanged around @xmath35 .",
    "thus , because of the statistical error of the determination of the velocity dispersion , it is concluded that the current data of cl0024 + 1654 does not rule out the cosmological model without @xmath1 .",
    "however , in the statistical sense , it is possible to put a bound on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , if one can apply this method to a lot of clusters of galaxies .",
    "for instance , if one uses ten clusters of galaxies , the statistical error of the velocity dispersion becomes less than four percent , so that one may distinguish some cosmological models , say with @xmath92 and @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , the mass profile used as the lens model must be confirmed in order to make this cosmological test reliable .",
    "thus it is of great importance that the mass or the mass profile of the lens is determined precisely .",
    "it is hoped that the mass reconstruction by the weak gravitational lensing ( kaiser and squires 1993 ; kaiser 1995 ; seitz and schneider 1995a , 1995b ) as well as the analysis of the velocity field in the cluster of galaxies ( yee , ellingson and carlberg 1996 ) clarifies the precise mass profile of the cluster as the lens .",
    "then the cosmological test discussed here will work well .",
    "without assuming the spatially flat universe , we have reexamined the cosmological test done by fmd , by using the dr angular diameter distance in order to take into account the clumpiness of the universe .",
    "if the angular diameter distance is that in the flrw universe , namely ignoring the effect of the clumpiness , it is found that @xmath0 can not be determined directly by this method .",
    "it was also shown that the effect of inhomogeneities of the universe can become too large to be ignored , particularly for a high density universe .",
    "therefore , this method can not be taken as a clear cosmological test to determine @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is possible to provide a bound on @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the clumpy universe . for more quantitative discussion",
    ", it is necessary to consider the gravitational lensing in a more realistic inhomogeneous universe .    in section 5",
    ", we mentioned that the statistical error of the velocity dispersion can be the most serious problem in the cosmological test discussed here .",
    "therefore , in order to constrain @xmath0 and @xmath1 by this method , it is necessary to observe many clusters of galaxies .",
    "for instance , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) will provide us with a lot of clusters of galaxies which are useful for this cosmological test .",
