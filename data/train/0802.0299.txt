    "spin liquids are some of the most interesting spin phases that we know to exist theoretically .",
    "however experimentally they are hard to achieve because of the competition with magnetically ordered or spin - peierls phases .",
    "frustration can suppress the order , and one of the promising systems where strong frustration occurs with natural interactions is the nearest neighbor spin 1/2 antiferromagnet on kagome lattice .",
    "herbertsmithite zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 contains kagome layers of spin-1/2 magnetic cu@xmath4 moments and has emerged as one such candidate in the recent years .",
    "@xcite despite the large curie - weiss temperature of roughly @xmath5k , experiments observe no magnetic order down to @xmath6mk and no sign of spin freezing or spin - peierls transition .",
    "various measurements also suggest that there is no gap to excitations , but the nature of the phase remains elusive .    from the beginning,@xcite",
    "it has been appreciated that there is significant amount of disorder in the zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 . even though impurities do not seem to produce a glassy behavior",
    ", they can mask the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the system such as the spin susceptibility and specific heat .",
    "the type of disorder has been clarified to some degree in recent experiments,@xcite which suggest that 5 to 10% of the cu that would ideally be in the kagome layers interchange their position with the nonmagnetic zn between the layers .",
    "the picture that is suggested is that the misplaced cu behave as weakly coupled spins giving rise to the curie tail and anomalous low - temperature specific heat in the absence of the field , while the misplaced zn effectively create spin vacancies in the kagome layers .",
    "there have been many theoretical studies of the clean spin-1/2 kagome system.@xcite exact diagonalization studies@xcite indicate no magnetic or spin - peierls order .",
    "spin wave and series expansion studies@xcite near several ordered states also indicate that the magnetic orders are not stable ( but a recent work@xcite suggests that a valence bond solid may be stable ) .",
    "high temperature expansion studies @xcite for susceptibility of the heisenberg model provide good quantitative comparison with the experiments and recent works @xcite account for possible curie impurity spin contribution or possible dzyaloshinsky - moriya interactions to better match the measurements in the herbertsmithite .",
    "there are a number of theoretical proposals for spin liquids in the spin-1/2 kagome.@xcite of interest to the present work are gapless spin liquids .",
    "one is the algebraic ( dirac ) spin liquid ( asl ) of hastings@xcite and ran@xcite whose trial energy is very close to the ground state energy obtained from the exact diagonalization.@xcite recently , ma and marston@xcite suggested that a different spin liquid with a spinon fermi surface may be stabilized in the presence of ferromagnetic second - neighbor interactions . coming from a very different perspective",
    ", ryu@xcite suggested an algebraic ( dirac ) vortex liquid , which bears some resemblance to the asl in its gapless nature but is a distinct phase .",
    "impurities modify the properties of the ground state , but at the same time they can be used as a probe of the system , which is our pursuit here . in the nmr context , impurities allow the external magnetic field , which would be strictly @xmath7 probe in a clean system , to couple to other potentially more important wavevectors . despite a large body of work on defects in correlated systems ( see refs .   and references therein ) ,",
    "there have been only few studies of impurities in frustrated magnets.@xcite exact diagonalization study by dommange@xcite provides important hints on the behavior of spins near a vacancy in the kagome antiferromagnet .",
    "our work is motivated by the recent @xmath8o nmr measurements of olariu@xcite , which shows direct access to the local spin susceptibility .",
    "each oxygen atom feels the magnetic moments of two copper atoms it is connected to , see pictures in refs .  .",
    "because of the nonmagnetic impurities , some oxygens feel two and some only one spin .",
    "the two peaks that are observed in the nmr spectra at high temperatures are explained as coming from these two types of oxygens , neglecting variations in local susceptibility . as the temperature is lowered the peaks first move towards larger susceptibilities and then back to the smaller ones broadening at the same time . at the lowest temperatures only one peak is visible which saturates at small but positive susceptibility value .",
    "a strong inhomogeneous broadening was also observed in @xmath9cl nmr at low temperatures,@xcite but with no clear features that would allow spatial resolution .    in this paper",
    "we calculate local susceptibility of kagome lattice in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities , which are treated as missing spins , by two different methods .    in the first part we use 12-th order high temperature series expansion for the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .",

    "[ fig_ht_hist_susc ] , [ fig_ht_hist_susc_pair ] .",
    "we obtain quantitatively accurate results down to about @xmath10 .",
    "these can be directly used to test whether the heisenberg model with spin vacancies applies to the zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 . for this range of temperatures",
    ", the local susceptibility goes to the bulk value already at a few lattice spacings from an impurity . on the other hand ,",
    "the local susceptibility @xmath11 of the spin next to the impurity is larger than the bulk @xmath12 by as much as 15 - 20% .",
    "this can be understood by realizing that the cu near the impurity has only three neighbors instead of four , which directly affects the local curies - weiss temperature giving 14% change in @xmath13 at this temperature .",
    "the series expansion study develops this observation systematically to significantly lower temperatures and for all sites . on the other hand",
    ", we find that @xmath11 starts to decrease around @xmath14 and drops below the bulk susceptibility at @xmath15 , well before the bulk susceptibility starts to decrease at about @xmath16.@xcite this is consistent with the ground state picture found in the exact diagonalization study,@xcite where a pair of spins that are both next to impurity forms an almost perfect singlet , so these spins become effectively non - responsive .",
    "one lesson we learn is that even at elevated temperatures one can not assume the same susceptibility on all kagome sites .",
    "when connecting with the experiments , we suggest to consider at least two different susceptibilities : @xmath11 for the immediate neighbors of impurities and @xmath12 for the rest of the cu sites . in the @xmath8o nmr experiments,@xcite",
    "we then suggest four main groups of the oxygen knight shifts as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ht_hist_susc_pair ] .",
    "we hope that our finding and improved experimental resolution can be used to further test the applicability of the heisenberg model to the herbertsmithite .",
    "in the low temperature study , we attempt to understand the susceptibility histograms in the spin liquid framework , taking up the asl of hastings@xcite and ran@xcite with dirac spectrum for the spinons .",
    "first we perform the mean field analysis treating the spinons as free fermions hopping on kagome lattice with impurity sites removed . again",
    "we calculate the susceptibility near a single impurity and in the presence of 5% of impurities .",
    "we should say from the outset that such a simplified treatment of the spinons is likely inadequate near impurities and one should allow modifying both spinon hopping amplitudes and fluxes near impurities .",
    "for example , the exact diagonalization study@xcite finds strong singlet correlations on bonds next to an impurity .",
    "furthermore , thinking about possible more accurate self - consistent treatments suggests that the spinon hopping should also be strengthened on these bonds .",
    "such modifications will certainly have significant effect on the calculated susceptibility of the spins nearest to the impurity .",
    "however we argue that there are robust features in the susceptibility histograms that are insensitive to the details of the treatment near the impurities .",
    "the vacancies are a source of disorder which will induce a finite density of states at the fermi level with a characteristic spatial distribution .",
    "the bulk susceptibility associated with the sites that are further from impurities decreases as the temperature is lowered , just as it would for the pure system where it goes all the way to zero because of the vanishing density of states at the fermi energy in the dirac spectrum .",
    "however the impurities cause finite density of states and as more and more sites start to feel the impurities as we lower the temperature , which all sites eventually do since there is a finite density of impurities , the movement of the histogram peak to zero stops as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_ff_susc_pair ] . there , the detailed features seen at high temperatures depend on the treatment of impurities and should not be taken quantitatively ; on the other hand , the overall picture of the disorder - induced broadening of the vanishing pure dirac susceptibility into an asymmetric histogram should be more robust .",
    "we also test the approach beyond the mean field by studying the magnetization distribution in the trial spin wavefunctions obtained by gutzwiller projection .",
    "this approach can reproduce nontrivial results for the local susceptibilities near impurities in one dimension.@xcite in the kagome system with impurities , the main effect that we find is the increase in local susceptibility variation by about a factor of two , while the qualitative predictions of the mean field remain unchanged . in particular , we find that the local susceptibility can be also negative , deviating significantly from the positive bulk value .",
    "this can happen because there are strong antiferromagnetic correlations in the system .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that the local susceptibility variation due to impurities is significant both at high and low temperatures and its experimental observation can reveal a wealth of information about the spin state . at high temperatures ,",
    "it is possible to track several features associated with different locations relative to impurities .",
    "in particular , the susceptibility at the oxygen sites next to impurity should be @xmath11 which is different from the half of @xmath17 seen by the oxygens in the bulk .",
    "if one could improve nmr line resolution , more peaks should be observable at high temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the peaks broaden as the temperature is lowered and particularly as the system enters the correlated paramagnet regime .",
    "our spin liquid study suggests that there remain no features in the susceptibility histogram except for the overall peak associated with the bulk sites , which first moves towards zero as in the pure dirac spin liquid and then stops because of the disorder - generated nonzero density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this is reminiscent of what is observed in the @xmath8o nmr experiments , even if not in every detail ; it is also qualitatively different from the spin liquid with a fermi surface , where there is a finite density of states in the pure system and the impurities would only broaden the histogram both ways without changing significantly the bulk peak location .",
    "we consider spin @xmath18 nearest neighbor anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg model on kagome lattice .",
    "local spin susceptibility at site @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "we calculate @xmath13 s in the high temperature series expansions in the presence of a single nonmagnetic impurity , treated as a missing site ( vacancy ) .",
    "we also study the kagome system in the presence of a finite density of nonmagnetic impurities , which we chose to be 5% as motivated by experiments@xcite in zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 .",
    "the expansion is performed to the 12-th order in @xmath22 ( or 13-th order in @xmath23 ) using the linked cluster expansion.@xcite the outline of the procedure is as follows .",
    "we generate all abstract graphs up to desired size .",
    "then we generate all subgraphs of these graphs , keeping track of the location of each subgraph in the graph .",
    "we calculate the local susceptibility for each graph at each point of the graph .",
    "then we subtract all the subgraphs of each graph as needed in the linked cluster expansion to get the contribution this graph would give when embedded into lattice . the local susceptibility on any lattice",
    "can be calculated by creating all possible embeddings of all graphs and adding their contributions at every site . in this general formulation ,",
    "the lattice does not need to be regular ; in particular , this procedure applies to the kagome lattice with impurities . in the practical implementation",
    ", we use the symmetries of the underlying pure kagome lattice for efficiency and discard the embeddings that contain an impurity . in this way , we obtain exact @xmath23 series for the system with impurities .    one more remark about the method . in the derivation of the linked cluster expansion for the local susceptibility , one needs to calculate expressions of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 are integers .",

    "they start diverging and we take that as a point where the approximation stops being valid .",
    "different values of @xmath29 are tried , and sometimes it is possible to tune to a value where all the curves overlap completely to a much lower temperature , but that is a pathology , probably indicating that the polynomials are all the same . for other values of @xmath29",
    "the curves usually start to diverge from each other at around the same temperature .",
    "the series coefficients of the pure kagome lattice susceptibility and of the local susceptibilities of the first four nearest neighbors near a single impurity are in table  [ tab_local_susc ] .",

    "thinking about the experiments , the nmr lines are too broad to resolve the groups @xmath17 , @xmath44 , and @xmath43 , but just enough to separate these from the group @xmath11 .",

    "we consider the system at half filling which corresponds to spin @xmath18 .",
    "the pure system has dirac nodes and a linearly vanishing density of states at the fermi level , while the impurities induce a finite density of states , and one of the main questions we address is how it is distributed locally .    if @xmath50 is the set of single - particle wavefunctions , it is easy to show that the local susceptibility at temperature @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the fermi distribution . for a given configuration of impurities ,",
    "we obtain the single - particle orbitals by numerical diagonalization and use this formula to calculate the local susceptibility . in the @xmath54 limit , the local susceptibility is simply proportional to the local density of states at the fermi level , @xmath55 .",
    "let us briefly describe the localization properties of the single - particle states in our system with 5% density of impurities .",
    "we expect that all states are eventually localized , since this is a time - reversal invariant anderson localization problem in two dimensions with no special symmetries .",

    "however , even for the latter as happens around half - filling , the localization lengths are still very large .",
    "for example , we calculate the participation ratios of the states near half - filling and find that the corresponding volume fraction of participating sites decreases only from about 14% in a @xmath56 system to about 10% in a @xmath33 system , indicating that these states are still extended over our system sizes up to @xmath33 . on the other hand",

    "in such treatments of pure systems , one typically finds that the self - consistent @xmath58 vanishes above some temperature of order @xmath22 ( e.g. , in the renormalized mean field scheme this temperature is @xmath60 ) .",
    "there is no sense of speaking about spinons above this temperature , and the system is more appropriately described in terms of weakly correlated individual spins . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath58 becomes nonzero at lower temperatures , suggesting that the system enters the correlated paramagnet regime .",
    "below the onset temperature , the self - consistent @xmath58 quickly reaches the values similar to the zero - temperature limit .",

    "we can estimate the spinon hopping amplitude from self - consistent mean field conditions .",
    "for example , in the so - called renormalized mean field scheme , this reads @xmath62 where @xmath63 is some renormalization factor ( which can be found , e.g. , by comparing measurements before and after the projection ) . in the case with @xmath46 flux through each hexagon and at @xmath64 , hastings found @xmath65 . using a reasonable @xmath66",

    "[ sec : improvements ] below , while here we want to take a crude look whether such proposal can explain the observed inhomogeneous knight shifts in the herbertsmithite.@xcite the specific results that we find here are as follows .",
    "the spin susceptibilities are always positive in the mean field .",
    "we show that they can become negative and the knight shift distributions are actually broader when we go beyond the mean field .",
    "unfortunately , one can not access the local susceptibilities from the study of the singlet ground state . to circumvent this",
    ", we consider trial states with non - zero @xmath89 and study how the total spin is distributed among the lattice sites .",
    "the idea is that the pattern of the local magnetizations @xmath90 in such weakly polarized states is similar to that of the local susceptibilities at low temperatures .",
    "this approach has been used in exact diagonalization studies of spin systems with impurities , where one considers @xmath91 in the lowest - energy states in the sectors with nonzero @xmath89 .",
    "we are trying this in the variational spin liquid studies in the present kagome problem and also for the organic spin liquid on the triangular lattice.@xcite ( we have also tried this approach in a one - dimensional chain with vacancies@xcite and reproduced the non - trivial qualitative behavior predicted by eggert and affleck.@xcite )    consider a mean field state with different chemical potentials for the two spin species , @xmath92 .",
    "the orbitals with @xmath93 are occupied by the @xmath94 spins but not by the @xmath95 spins , which produces non - zero @xmath96 . in the mean field , the local magnetization is given by @xmath97 observe the similarity of this expression to that for the local susceptibility at finite temperature , eq .",
    "( [ eq_chi_freef ] ) .",
    "the difference is that here the contributing orbitals are selected by a sharp energy window @xmath98 $ ] , while in eq .",
    "( [ eq_chi_freef ] ) the window is soft proportional to @xmath99 with width set by the temperature .",
    "if there is a finite density of states at the fermi level and if the properties of the orbitals do not change strongly with the energy , the two windows of similar width should give similar results for the local magnetization or susceptibility normalized by the corresponding average values .",
    "the above two windows roughly match when @xmath100 . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "we indeed observe such correspondence of the @xmath101 and @xmath74 distributions .    from the mean field state with non - zero @xmath89",
    ", we construct the spin wave function by gutzwiller projection .",
    "note that @xmath89 is preserved by the projection , so the average magnetization is unchanged .",
    "however , the local magnetizations are modified .",
    "our observations in the present system can be summarized by the following crude rule : the deviation of the site magnetization from the average is enhanced by the projection by a typical factor between 1.5 and 2 .",
    "this implies that the distribution of the local magnetization is broadened by the same factor upon the projection .",
    "figure  [ fig : distrszloc ] illustrates this for a @xmath57 sample with @xmath102 vacancies and @xmath103 .",
    "distribution of the local magnetization in the @xmath46-flux spin liquid state with non - zero @xmath89 .",
    "the sample is @xmath57 with @xmath102 randomly placed vacancies ; the total magnetization is @xmath104 .",
    "we compare the mean field and the gutzwiller - projected results for exactly the same system and find that the projection broadens the histogram by about a factor of 1.5 - 2 , which can be clearly seen despite the noisiness of the data in the single random sample . ]",
    "-2 mm    we have tried several lattice sizes , different disorder samples , and different magnetizations @xmath96 , and in all cases observed the above rule .",
    "this rule is not strict but holds for a majority of sites .",
    "more precisely , the histogram of the ratios @xmath105 is peaked near @xmath106 , which is the claimed typical enhancement factor for the deviations from the average . in particular , while the mean field local magnetization is always non - negative , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mloc ] ) , the local magnetization can become negative after the projection .",
    "it can be opposite to the bulk magnetization because of the antiferromagnetic correlations present in the system .",
    "let us say few words about our choice of @xmath107 in fig .",
    "[ fig : distrszloc ] . on one hand , if we take @xmath108 , we worry if the results are dominated by the specific single - particle state that happened to lie at the fermi level . this is a concern because of our view that all states will be eventually anderson - localized .",
    "however , by considering the participation ratio for the states near the fermi level in the present sample , we find that they are still spread over about one third of the sites .",
    "we have checked that even for such small @xmath109 the results for the broadening of the distribution by the projection are qualitatively similar . on the other hand ,",
    "we do not want @xmath109 to be large , which could take us far from the region in the spectrum near the fermi level and also would correspond to physically inaccessible magnetization .",
    "our @xmath110 is a compromise , since a few typical states around the fermi level are sampled , and also since it corresponds to about @xmath111% of the maximal polarization , which is reasonable also from the experimental perspective .",
    "for example , using the estimate@xcite @xmath112 emu / mol cu , the field of 7 tesla in the @xmath8o experiments@xcite magnetizes the system to about 1.5% of the maximal polarization of the kagome layer .    to conclude this section",
    ", we find that the gutzwiller trial wavefunction treatment does not modify the mean field results qualitatively but widens the magnetization distributions by about a factor of two.@xcite in particular , at low temperature the distribution will have a sizable wing on the negative values , which is consistent with the nmr experiments.@xcite to describe the @xmath8o nmr line , we need to histogram the field @xmath113 associated with bonds @xmath38 of the kagome lattice .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distroxygennmr ] . the wing at negative fields is weaker than in the cu nmr because the oxygens perform some `` averaging '' of the local @xmath114 ( while the total magnetization is positive ) .",
    "we reiterate here the crudeness of our study ; in particular , we are not attempting here to explain the actual experimental histogram in the @xmath8o nmr , which looks nearly symmetric with respect to the peak at the lowest temperature .",
    "our main message is that within the spin liquid approach , by going beyond the mean field , we expect broader distribution of the knight shifts with both positive and negative susceptibilities due to the underlying correlations .     oxygen nmr local fields corresponding to the same system as in fig .",
    "[ fig : distrszloc ] . ]    -2 mm      the main reservation about the presented spin liquid study is that we modeled the effect of impurities by simply removing the zn sites in the spinon mean field .",
    "we did not perform a self - consistent mean field or an energetics study of the system with impurities .",
    "however , we did think how such more accurate treatments could affect our results and tested the robustness of the features by trying different modifications that such treatments might require .",
    "one minor concern is that even though the system is inhomogeneous , we require the half - filling for spinons only on average over the whole sample and not at each site . the latter is likely a better treatment since then the gutzwiller projection is less drastic and the mean field is closer to the projected state .",
    "we find that in our samples the deviations of the local densities from the average are small and smaller in relative terms than the deviations of the local susceptibilities that we are interested in .",
    "we also tested small systems achieving the half - filling precisely at all sites by adjusting local chemical potential and found that the susceptibilities did not change qualitatively or significantly quantitatively and only at the the lowest temperatures the histograms became somewhat broader .",
    "a more serious concern is that we took the spinon hopping amplitudes to be the same as in the clean system , instead of finding them self - consistently .",
    "thus , we expect that at low temperatures the hopping connecting two sites that are both next to an impurity should be larger than for other bonds .",
    "consider , for example , the renormalized mean field scheme , eq .",
    "( [ rmf ] ) .",
    "when we calculate the bond expectation value @xmath115 in our mean field starting with all @xmath116 equal , which can be viewed as a first step in the self - consistency iteration , we find that it is the largest on the bonds next to impurities .",
    "we have not pursued this scheme any further since in the present case it would actually lead to a dimer state in the clean system , which we know is a pathology of such treatment when applied to the spin-1/2 system . roughly , one should not be using the same renormalization factor @xmath63 irrespective of the bond expectation value . by comparing with the gutzwiller - projected measurements , one typically uses @xmath66 for translationally invariant states , but one should take a smaller @xmath117 for the dimer states .",
    "one could use a different mean field scheme to capture this , e.g. , the scheme due to hsu,@xcite which leads to the self - consistency conditions of the form @xmath118 this suppresses the dimerization tendency of the less elaborate mean field but may be doing it already too much , while we may want to retain some possibility of local dimers in the system with impurities . we leave a detailed exploration of such approaches and whether they can capture the actual energetics in the system with impurities to future work .",
    "it is interesting to notice however that if we took the most naive treatment fig .",
    "[ fig_ff_si ] , at low enough temperatures the nearest neighbor susceptibility is larger than twice the bulk and a little peak starts to emerge on the right of the bulk peak in fig .",
    "[ fig_ff_susc_pair ] for @xmath119 .",
    "if this were the case then the peaks in ref .   at low temperatures would have the opposite interpretation ",
    "bulk peak would become closer to zero and the next to impurity oxygen peak further from zero .",
    "however we can not make this conclusion at this point since the bonding of the spins next to the impurity will decrease the local susceptibility near the impurity .",
    "we only would like to point out that one should be careful when interpreting the experiment .",
    "for the treatment of the spin liquid near impurity , we only note some crude things that we tried to see how our results might be affected .",
    "motivated by the above observation , we have studied local susceptibilities at low temperatures when we multiplied by 2 all the bonds connecting the two sites that are both next to an impurity .",
    "certainly , this has a strong effect on the susceptibility @xmath11 of these sites  it in fact becomes smaller than the bulk one , which is opposite to the results in the preceding section where the @xmath11 is the largest .",
    "thus , such treatment can make the results for @xmath11 more in line with the series study , sec .",
    "[ sec : series ] , and exact diagonalization study , ref .  , that suggest that this susceptibility is depressed at low temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the above change of the hopping strengths near impurities does not have significant effect on the bulk susceptibility histogram peak and its marching to lower values with decreasing temperature ( except , of course , for small numerical differences ) .",
    "we have also tried modifying not only the strengths of the bonds but also fluxes next to impurities .",
    "for example , if we view the proposed @xmath46-hexagon spin liquid as a time reversal invariant way of performing flux attachment and flux - smearing mean field , obtaining dirac spin liquid instead of a chiral spin liquid ( see discussion in sec .",
    "iic of ref .  )",
    ", it suggests that we should also remove a @xmath46 flux when we remove a spin . in an exploratory gutzwiller energetics study with impurities",
    ", we indeed find that this often improves the trial energy .",
    "as far as we are concerned here with the local susceptibilities , such local flux modification of course has an effect on the sites near the impurities , but has little effect on the described qualitative behavior of the bulk peak .",
    "we also remark that making all hexagon fluxes equal to zero@xcite results in a qualitatively different behavior of the bulk of the susceptibility histogram . here",
    "the clean system has a finite density of states at the fermi level and therefore a nonzero susceptibility at low temperatures .",
    "we tried this for the system with 5% density of impurities and indeed found that the bulk peak does nt march down .",
    "instead , it approaches a relatively large value of susceptibility and broadens to both high and low values of susceptibility .",
    "we then propose that the experiments suggest more a dirac - like spin liquid than the one with a full fermi surface .",
    "using the high temperature series expansion , we calculated local susceptibility for the nearest neighbor heisenberg antiferromagnet on kagome lattice down to about @xmath120 .",
    "the resulting histogram of susceptibilities can be directly compared to the experiment to test whether the heisenberg model with impurities applies to zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 .",
    "the calculated histogram contains a lot of fine structure some of which we hope can be observed if the resolution of the experiments improves .",
    "one issue not considered in experiments is that the local susceptibility @xmath11 next to impurities is larger than the bulk value by as much as 20% at high temperatures between @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this should affect the peak associated with the oxygens close to impurity , and one should be careful at interpreting the observed features at the intermediate and lower temperatures .",
    "our work suggests that @xmath11 drops below the bulk value at low temperatures and is consistent with earlier exact diagonalization study@xcite which found that these sites tend to form singlets .",
    "the latter was invoked in ref .   to explain a sharp feature in the nmr signal appearing near low temperatures .",
    "this is appealing , but more work needs to be done to understand the origin of this feature , particularly in the presence of the sizable impurity concentration , and also with the added bulk peak contribution that we expect in the spin liquid regime .    at low temperatures we assumed that the system forms a spin liquid of ran@xcite we calculated the susceptibility histograms in the mean field theory and went beyond mean field by using gutzwiller projection .",
    "our results for the local susceptibility should not be trusted quantitatively close to impurity , since these depend on the details of the treatment of the spin liquid near the impurities , while we took a crude approach and only outlined how one can make it more accurate .",
    "in particular , we are not able to discuss histogram features associated with sites close to impurities .",
    "however we have a robust prediction for the behavior of the peak coming from the bulk of the sites ( fig .  [ fig_ff_susc ] ) : the bulk peak marches down with decreasing temperature ; its weight is gradually spread as further layers of sites around the impurities start to feel their share of the impurity - induced density of states ; the broadening saturates when all sites start to feel several and more impurities .",
    "we expect this qualitative description to be insensitive to the details of the mean field in the immediate vicinity of the impurities .",
    "it is sufficient to know that the clean spin liquid has dirac density of states and that the bulk sites do not see the impurities down to some temperature scale , while any treatment near the impurities represents some local disorder that always induces some density of states at the bulk sites .",
    "the effect of the gutzwiller projection is crudely to increase the variation of the local susceptibility by about a factor of two .",
    "in particular , as the peak spreads some of the susceptibilities become negative .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the observed knight shifts in the zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 experiments .",
    "such behavior observed in the presence of a sizable density of impurities then suggests that the clean spin liquid would have a vanishing density of states at the fermi level .",
    "thus it distinguishes this spin liquid from the proposal with a spinon fermi surface for which the peak would not march down but instead saturate at a large positive value . on the other hand ,",
    "since the algebraic vortex liquid of ryu@xcite has dirac - like gapless character , it would likely produce inhomogeneous knight shift behavior similar to the dirac spin liquid .",
    "in the future work it would be good to treat the spin liquid right near impurities more accurately , e.g. , in a self - consistent mean field or in an energetics study , and consequently make a reliable prediction for the spin susceptibility at these sites .",
    "quantitative comparison with other approaches such as exact diagonalization would also be useful",
    ". it would be interesting to consider quantitatively the gauge theory description of such spin liquid with disorder - induced finite density of states , though we do not expect our mean field results to be modified significantly . in a companion",
