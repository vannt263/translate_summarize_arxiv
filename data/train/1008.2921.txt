    "( fujita et al.2004 , hereafter f04 ) observations revealed a complex bird - like morphology in the central diffuse gas , with a plume of emission extending from symmetric wing - like features at the core .",
    "the plume is capped by the diffuse radio structure , and there is a clear deficit of x - ray emission in the region of the relic ( excluding the region of the overlapping plume ) .",
    "f02 and f04 consider several formation mechanisms for the plume and wings .",
    "they conclude that the plume was likely formed due to lifting of cool central gas by the buoyantly rising radio bubble , similar to what is seen in m87 . with the addition of _ xmm - newton",
    "_ observations , f04 suggest that the wings are formed by the passage of a weak shock through the cool core . as the shock front passes through the dense central gas , it curves around the central density peak , giving rise to the edges that define the x - ray wings .",
    "they also place an upper limit on non - thermal emission from inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by relativistic radio - emitting particles in the region of the relic .    in this paper",
    ", we report on results from a new _ chandra _ observation of abell  133 and from multi - frequency _ vla _ radio observations . based on these new observations ,",
    "we re - interpret the origin of the structure in the diffuse gas , examine the connection between the x - ray and radio features , and draw conclusions about the dynamical state and history of abell  133 .",
    "we assume an angular diameter distance to abell  133 of 223.7  mpc , which gives a scale of 1.08  kpc/. all error ranges are 68% confidence intervals ( i.e. , 1@xmath3 ) , unless otherwise stated .",
    "abell  133 was originally observed with _",
    "chandra _ on october 13 , 2000 , for 36  ksec with the _ chandra _ ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , pointed such that the central core was visible on the back - side illuminated acis - s3 ccd .",
    "it was subsequently observed twice in june 2002 with the front - side illuminated acis - i ccd array for a total of 90  ksec , with the pointing offset such the core was just beyond the corner of the field of view ( fov ) , to study the extended diffuse cluster emission ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "most recently , abell  133 was observed on august 29 , 2008 , for 70  ksec with the acis - i ccd array , pointed such that the cluster core was well within the fov .",
    "we consider the data from all four of these observations whenever possible , although the core itself is only covered by the acis - s3 and most recent acis - i observations .",
    "the details of these observations are given in table  [ tab : xray ] .",
    "these data were reduced using the method we have applied previously , e.g. , in randall et al .",
    "all data were reprocessed from the level 1 event files using the latest calibration files ( as of ciao4.1 ) .",
    "cti and time - dependent gain corrections were applied where applicable .",
    "lc_clean was used to remove background flares .",
    "the mean event rate was calculated using time bins within 3@xmath3 of the overall mean , and bins outside a factor of 1.2 of this mean were discarded .",
    "the resulting cleaned exposure times were 30  ksec for acis - s3 , 43  ksec and 42  ksec for the acis - i offset pointings , and 69  ksec for the targeted acis - i observation , giving total cleaned exposure times of 99  ksec in the core and 184  ksec west of the core .",
    "diffuse emission from abell  133 fills the image fov for each observation .",
    "we therefore used the standard caldb blank sky background files appropriate for each observation , normalized to our observations in the 10 - 12 kev energy band . to generate exposure maps , we assumed a mekal model with @xmath4  kev , galactic absorption , and abundance of 30% solar at a redshift @xmath5 , which is consistent with typical results for the extended emission from detailed spectral fits ( see   [ sec : xspec ] ) .",
    "we obtained low frequency radio observations of abell  133 ( pi : clarke ) using the _",
    "vla_. observations at frequencies of 74 and 330  mhz were obtained in the extended a configuration on august 16 , 2003 , and 330  mhz observations in b configuration were taken on july 9 , 2002 .",
    "details of the observations are presented in table  [ tab : radio ] .",
    "the low frequency observations were all taken in multi - channel continuum mode to allow excision of radio frequency interference and reduce the effects of bandwidth smearing .",
    "the a configuration 74  mhz data used cygnus  a as a bandpass and gain calibrator , while the 330  mhz a configuration observations were calibrated using 3c48 as a bandpass , phase , and flux calibrator .",
    "the b configuration 330  mhz observations used 3c48 as the bandpass and flux calibrator and the nearby calibrator source 0116 - 208 as a phase calibrator .",
    "all data were processed using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the images were produced through the standard fourier transform deconvolution method .",
    "the data were processed through several loops of imaging and self - calibration to reduce the effects of phase and amplitude errors . due to the large fields of view at these low frequencies",
    "all data were processed within aips using the wide - field imaging techniques which correct for distortions in the image caused by the non - coplanarity of the _",
    "vla_. this technique involved using a set of overlapping maps ( facets ) to cover the desired image area ( cornwell & perley 1992 ) .    the first round of phase calibration of the 74 mhz data was undertaken using the best 330 mhz b configuration images as the input model .",
    "this method corrects any phase offsets between the two data sets .",
    "all data sets were checked for positional errors introduced during calibration by comparing positions from gaussian fits of ten compact sources surrounding the target to known source positions from the literature .",
    "the 330 mhz a configuration data was found to have a small position shift which was corrected using the known source positions .",
    "in addition to our low frequency observations of this system , we have also extracted and reduced _ vla _ archive data at 1400 mhz taken in c configuration .",

    "a close - up of the x - ray emission from the core is shown in figure  [ fig : xr_core ] .",
    "the core shows a complex `` bird - like '' morphology , previously noted by f02 , with diffuse wings of emission extending from the southern end of a long plume oriented from southeast to northwest ( the `` tongue '' identified by f02 ) . on either side of the plume , north of the x - ray wings , there are two surface brightness depressions , which were identified as x - ray cavities ( presumably devoid of x - ray emitting gas ) by brzan et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2008 ) .",
    "although the cd galaxy ( marked with a blue cross in figure  [ fig : xr_core ] , position from _",
    "2mass _ catalog by skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) is near the peak of diffuse x - ray emission , the overall emission is not centered on the galaxy .",
    "there is a finger of bright emission extending from the brightness peak in the southeast along the interior of the plume , and terminating just before the round cap to the plume , giving the impression that the plume has formed from gas being pushed or pulled out of the central core .",
    "the complex morphology of the diffuse emission , as well as the offset of the central cd galaxy from the local x - ray centroid , indicate a highly disturbed , non - relaxed core .",
    "to verify the surface brightness depressions on either side of the plume , we extracted the radial surface brightness profiles in four sectors : one for each of the depressions , and the remaining azimuthal range split into two sectors to the northeast and south ( the sector containing the plume was excluded ) .",
    "these sectors are shown in figure  [ fig : sectors ] .",
    "the complex structure in the diffuse emission makes it difficult to chose a central position for our extraction regions .",
    "we choose to use the centroid of the x - ray emission within 30  ( 33  kpc ) of the core , which we find to be ( 01@xmath602@xmath741.6@xmath8 , -21@xmath95248.4  [ j2000 ] ) , 9  from the position adopted by f02 based on the centroid of the emission at smaller radii . as can be seen from figure  [ fig : fullimg ] , this position does not coincide with the central cd galaxy , nor does it coincide with any bright peaks in the x - ray emission , but rather it is offset from the cd galaxy in the direction of the plume .",
    "however , it is consistent with the centroid of the extended emission at large radii , and is therefore appropriate for studying surface brightness profiles outside of the core .",
    "the 0.65  kev exposure corrected surface brightness profiles for concentric annuli in each sector are shown in figure  [ fig : sbsect ] .",
    "the left panel shows the measurements , with error bars , while the right panel shows the profiles as connected lines , without error bars , for clarity .",
    "each of the sectors corresponding to surface brightness depressions show deficits between roughly 10 - 30  ( red and blue lines in the right panel ) , consistent with the x - ray image and with existing size estimates for the x - ray cavities ( brzan et al .",
    "2004 ) and coincident radio lobes ( brzan et al .  2008 ) given in the literature .",
    "such depressions are not seen in the northern and southern sectors ( green and black lines in the right panel of figure  [ fig : sbsect ] ) , which instead show abrupt changes in slope at about 27 .",
    "we discuss these surface brightness discontinuities further in ",
    "[ sec : profs ] .    to quantify the significance of the cavities",
    ", we measured the net surface brightness in annular sectors across the cavities ( corresponding to the sectors shown in figure  [ fig : sectors ] ) , and in a 247@xmath9  wide sector excluding the cavities and bright plume .",
    "the radial range of the sectors was 10 30 .",
    "we find average 0.32  kev net rates of @xmath10  cts  s@xmath11  pix@xmath11 for the western cavity , @xmath12  cts  s@xmath11  pix@xmath11 for the northern cavity , and @xmath13  cts  s@xmath11  pix@xmath11 for the wide sector .",
    "thus , the decrement associated with the northern cavity is significant at 8.3@xmath3 , while the western cavity is significant at 20@xmath3 .",
    "radio images derived from _ vla _",
    "observations at multiple frequencies and array configurations are shown in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs ] .",
    "the high - resolution 1.4  ghz image in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]a ( taken from s01 ) clearly shows the well - known diffuse radio source nvss  j010241 - 215230 just north of the core in abell  133 ( throughout this paper we will refer to this source as the `` relic '' , or sometimes the `` northern lobe '' , depending on context ) .",
    "the relic exhibits complex filamentary structure .",
    "the core source in abell  133 is roughly 34  ( 37  kpc ) southeast of the relic .",
    "the position of the core matches the optical position of the cd galaxy .",
    "there is some extended emission associated with this core , in particular to the east , where there is a bright inner 6.7  ( 7.2  kpc ) extension connecting to a fainter loop feature that extends 24  ( 26  kpc ) from the core .",
    "based on older 1400  mhz _ vla _ observations ( which we do not consider here ) , rizza et al .",
    "( 2000 ) claim to detect a bridge of emission connecting the relic with the cd galaxy .",
    "s01 argue that this claim is not supported by their more sensitive , higher - resolution _ vla _ observations ( shown in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]a ) .",
    "our 330  mhz a configuration image shown in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]c does appear to show a connection between the cd and the relic , although the resolution is lower than in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]a .",
    "figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]a also shows two other prominent core - like sources , one 54(59  kpc ) west of the cd ( which we we call the `` western core '' ) , with some extended emission to the south , and a second 1.53  ( 100  kpc ) southeast of the cd ( which we will call the `` southern core '' ) , with some extended emission to the southwest .",
    "both sources were noted by s01 ( galaxies e and j , respectively , in their figure  6 ) , and , as they point out , optical identifications put the western source within the cluster ( @xmath14 , merrifield & kent 2001 ) , while southeastern source is at a much higher redshift ( @xmath15 , owen et al .",
    "1995 ) .    the lower frequency observations ( and the lower - resolution 1400  mhz image shown in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]b ) reveal unexpected structure in the large - scale radio emission .",
    "the southern core shows two opposite extensions to the north and south ( which we will call the `` jets '' of the southern core ) , with the northern jet extending to the relic in abell  133 in figures  [ fig : rad_imgs]d , e .",
    "a diffuse southern lobe is revealed , roughly 3.2south of the southern core , somewhat larger than the distance to the relic in the north ( 2.2 ) .",
    "the lobe has a shell - like morphology in figures  [ fig : rad_imgs]b , c ( low - resolution 1400  mhz and high - resolution 330  mhz images ) , but appears more uniform in figures  [ fig : rad_imgs]d , e ( low - resolution 330  mhz and 74  mhz images ) .",
    "it is visible in figure  10 of brzan et al .",
    "2008 , although they do not discuss this feature .",
    "it is distinct from the source reported in the nrao _ vla _ sky survey ( _ nvss _ , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , nvss  j010239 - 215708 , indicated in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]d and also evident in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]b ( we note that the _ nvss _ source is coincident with the position of the optically detected cluster apmcc  138 reported by dalton et al .  [",
    "1997 ] at @xmath16 , close to the redshift of abell  133 ) .",
    "the southern jet of the southern core points in the direction of the southern lobe , and connects to the lobe in figures  [ fig : rad_imgs]b , d .",
    "the jet shows multiple twists , turns , and bright spots , most evident in figures  [ fig : rad_imgs]c , d ( the `` arc '' indicated in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]c ) .",
    "the large - scale morphology of the low frequency radio observations is consistent with what is expected for a double - lobed radio galaxy .",
    "if this is the case , the redshift of the optical source associated with the southern core ( @xmath15 ) gives a total projected extent of 1.6  mpc ( 6.2 ) , measured from the outer edge of the southern lobe to the outer edge of the northern lobe / relic .",
    "however , as pointed out by f02 , the relic feature to the north is obviously associated with the x - ray core and plume in abell  133 .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ fig : rad_overlay ] , which shows the _ chandra _ x - ray image ( blue ) overlaid with the 1400  mhz b configuration image ( red ) and 330  mhz a configuration ( green ) .",
    "the plume is capped by radio emission , which overlaps the cavities discussed in   [ sec : ximg ] , and is brightest in the northern cavity .",
    "the bridge of emission between the high - redshift southern core and abell  133 is also evident .",
    "the low frequency radio observations therefore reveal that the radio emission in the region of abell  133 is a complicated combination of possibly overlapping foreground and background sources .",
    "we discuss these features further in ",
    "[ sec : lobes ] .",
    "the x - ray image ( figure  [ fig : fullimg ] ) shows complicated structure in the core of abell  133 , as well as fainter icm emission filling the fov .",
    "we generated a temperature map as a guide for detailed spectral fitting to disentangle the various components and study the structure seen in the icm .",
    "spectra are grouped to a minimum of 40 counts per bin throughout .",
    "the temperature map was derived using the same method as developed in randall et al .",
    "for each temperature map pixel , we extracted a spectrum from a circular region containing 1000 net counts ( after subtracting the blank sky background ) .",
    "the resulting spectrum was fit in the 0.6  7.0  kev range with an absorbed apec model using xspec , with the abundance allowed to vary .",
    "our detailed spectral fits indicate an absorbing column of about 1.8 times the galactic value of @xmath17  @xmath18 , consistent with what was found by f02 .",
    "we therefore fixed the hydrogen column density at @xmath19  @xmath18 , which we find from detailed fits to the diffuse emission within the central 1.86  ( 121  kpc ) presented in ",
    "[ sec : dxspec ] .",
    "the resulting temperature map is shown in figure  [ fig : tmap ] .",
    "faint regions had extraction radii on the order of 1.4  ( 91  kpc ) , while the brightest regions , near the core , had radii of 5  ( 5.4  kpc ) .",
    "even with the coarse binning in the temperature map ( 9.8  arcsec@xmath20  pix@xmath11 ) the `` bird - like '' morphology of the central core can be seen , with cool wings of emission to the northeast and southwest , on either side of the cooler plume extending to the northwest .",
    "there is a curling tail of cooler emission extending east of the core , which is not associated with the radio bridge to the southern core noted in ",
    "[ sec : rimg ] .",
    "overall , the diffuse emission is patchy , with regions of cooler and hotter gas with statistically significant temperature differences .",
    "there is little large - scale structure in the map , expect perhaps on average higher temperatures in the southern half of the map as compared to the north .",
    "a higher - resolution temperature map of the core region is shown in figure  [ fig : tmap_core]b .",
    "the extraction radii ranged from 3  ( 3.3  kpc ) in the core to 15(16.3  kpc ) in the faint regions near the edge of the map .",
    "the white cross marks the optical position of the cd galaxy .",
    "the map reveals complex thermal structure in the core .",
    "the beginning of the eastern channel of cooler gas seen in the larger fov temperature map shown in figure  [ fig : tmap ] can be seen to the east .",
    "the plume is visible as an extension of cool gas with minima on the northern and southern tips , a cool central minimum , and some filamentary structure along the northeastern edge , which roughly coincides with the filamentary structure seen in the 1400  mhz radio observations ( figures  [ fig : rad_imgs]a  &  [ fig : rad_overlay ] ) .",
    "the coolest gas is at the northwest tip of the plume , although we show in   [ sec : dxspec ] that this is a projection effect , and that the gas in the southern tip is as cool or cooler .",
    "the southern minimum is offset from the cd galaxy , and contains two distinct `` sub - minima '' separated by about 6  ( 6.5  kpc ) .",
    "the raw _ xmm - newton optical monitor _",
    "( _ xmm - om _ ) image , shown in figure  [ fig : tmap_core]f , shows two similarly separated peaks , although at an offset position and position angle .",
    "the double peaks are also seen in _",
    "2mass _ , _ galex _ , and less clearly in _ dss _ images .",
    "the positions for the peaks match in _ xmm - om _ , _ 2mass _ ,",
    "_ galex _ , and _ dss _ images .",
    "the positions of _ chandra _ point sources in the field match those from observations at other wavelengths , suggesting that the astrometry is sound .",
    "the temperature map is effectively smoothed due to the extended size of the extraction regions , but the regions are small near the core ( @xmath213  radii ) , and if the offset between the optical and cool gas peaks was due to smoothing inherent in the temperature map we would expect the gas peaks to be offset along the cool plume of emission , to the northwest , whereas the gas is offset southeast of the cd .",
    "we conclude that this offset is real , and is likely the result of a dynamical disruption of the core .",
    "we discuss this further in ",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] .",
    "the projected abundance map is shown in figure  [ fig : tmap_core]c .",
    "it was derived using the same method as the temperature map , but with 4000 net counts per extraction region , so that the abundances could be measured to within 5 - 10% .",
    "the regions with highest abundance are on either side of the plume , which has roughly half the abundance of the surrounding region . in ",
    "[ sec : dxspec ] , we show that the apparent lower abundance in the plume is a projection effect , resulting from fitting a single temperature model emission from gas at a range of temperatures . both the temperature and abundance maps show regions of rapid change , or ragged edges , surrounding the central plume at radii ranging from about 20 to 40  kpc .",
    "these features are examined in detail in   [ sec : profs ] .",
    "the projected pseudo - pressure and pseudo - entropy maps are shown in figures  [ fig : tmap_core]d  &  [ fig : tmap_core]e .",

    "@xmath23 we compute the pseudo - pressure map as @xmath24 and the pseudo - entropy map as @xmath25 .",
    "the structure in the pseudo - entropy map is similar to what we see in the temperature map .",
    "the pseudo - pressure map shows an edge northwest of the cd galaxy , which coincides with the northern edge of the wing features in the x - ray image ( compare the overlaid curve in figures  [ fig : tmap_core]a  &  [ fig : tmap_core]d ) .",
    "we discuss this edge further in ",
    "[ sec : wings ] . to look for large - scale temperature structure , we generated a coarsely binned ( 20",

    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : acisi_tmap ] .",
    "the extended emission appears to be hotter on average in the south and southeast as compared to the north , consistent with figure  [ fig : tmap ] .",
    "there is a hot , @xmath216  kev spot to the southwest , and a cool clump of gas extending to the edge of the chip to the north .",
    "these features are explored further in ",
    "[ sec : dxspec ] .      based on the derived temperature map and x - ray image of the core",
    ", we defined 6 regions for detailed spectral analysis of the core , shown overlaid on the x - ray image and temperature map in figure  [ fig : regs ] .",
    "a summary of the fitted spectral models for each region is given in table  [ tab : xspec ] , along with a fit to the total diffuse emission within 1.9  ( 121  kpc ) of our adopted central position .",
    "each region was fitted with either a two temperature apec model ( with abundances tied ) or an apec plus power - law model . in each case , the two component model was a significant improvement over a single thermal model .",
    "the fit to the total diffuse emission implies an absorption of @xmath26  @xmath18 , above the galactic value of @xmath17  @xmath18 derived from hi maps ( kalberla et al .",
    "this is consistent with what was found by f02 .",
    "such `` absorption excesses '' have been found from x - ray observations of other clusters ( e.g. , pointecouteau et al .",
    "since the absorption excess is likely due to variations in the galactic absorbing column , which can vary across the field in a complicated way , we left the absorption free to vary in the fits in table  [ tab : xspec ] .",
    "we checked the impact of this freedom by redoing each fit with the absorption fixed at the value found from the fit to the total diffuse emission and at the galactic value . in all cases the best fitting parameter values agreed well within the 1@xmath3 confidence ranges , except for the abundance of the low temperature component for the fit to the total diffuse emission ( which was 40% larger ) .",
    "we conclude that either fixing the absorbing column at a reasonable value or allowing it to vary does not significantly affect the fitting results in table  [ tab : xspec ] .",
    "the fits to regions r1-r3 find a higher abundance than that indicated by the projected abundance map shown in figure  [ fig : tmap_core]c .",
    "this is due to the two temperature thermal model , which effectively deprojects emission from the central core and plume . fitting a multi - temperature spectrum with a single thermal model ,",
    "as is done when generating the temperature map of the core , will generally give an abundance measurement that is lower than the true abundance of the gas , although the best - fitting temperature is expected to be within the range bounded by the lowest and highest temperature components ( see buote et al .",
    "similarly , the detailed spectral fits show that the temperature of the cool gas in the southern peak ( r1 ) , near the cd galaxy , is consistent with the temperature of the gas in the `` cap '' of the plume ( r3 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the temperature map shown in figure  [ fig : tmap_core]b , which shows the coolest gas in the cap .",
    "this suggests that projection effects from hotter gas at larger radii is more significant for the southern peak than the northern cap .",
    "the spectrum of the region containing the radio relic in the core of abell  133 is of particular interest as we expect some non - thermal ic emission from the interaction between cmb photons and the synchrotron - emitting particles in the relic .",
    "additionally , the relic may contain thermal gas that is so hot and tenuous that its x - ray emission is negligible , although it contributes significantly to the pressure support for the x - ray cavity ( brzan et al .",
    "2008 find that , under the assumptions of equipartition and cavities devoid of x - ray emitting gas , the ratio of energy in protons to electrons @xmath27 must be several hundred to achieve pressure balance with the surrounding icm ) .",
    "region r4 roughly corresponds to the region of the radio relic shown in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs ] , and to the relic region defined by f04 .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : xspec ] , the two temperature and temperature plus power - law models both provide an improved fit over the single temperature model .",
    "for the two temperature model , the higher temperature could not be significantly constrained . however ,",
    "if we assume that the hot gas is contained within the radio relic , we can place an upper limit on its temperature by requiring that the thermal pressure be less than the local thermal pressure outside of the relic .",

    "the resulting spectral index maps are shown in figure  [ fig : index_maps ] .",
    "the structure of the maps support the impressions given by the radio brightness maps presented in   [ sec : rimg ] : the structure to the north consists of a relatively flat ( @xmath70 ) core adjacent to a steep ( @xmath71 ) diffuse source , which has previously been classified as a radio relic ( s01 ) .",
    "the southern core is also found to be flat , with two steeper jets extending to the north and south . in figure",

    "the northern lobe is coincident with the radio relic in the core of abell  133 , while the southern lobe is steeper in the west where it connects to the jet ( we verified that this gradient is not due to contamination from the nearby _ nvss _ source ) . the spectral maps are therefore consistent with the interpretation suggested in   [ sec : rimg ] , where emission from a distant , background radio galaxy associated with the southern core overlaps emission from the radio relic in abell  133 .",

    "this suggests either that each source is a `` dying '' core , or , more likely , that contamination from nearby diffuse emission is steepening the indices .",
    "the spectral index maps seem to support contamination : for example in the 330  1400  mhz map in the region of the southern core , the indices get as flat as -0.8 , and for the abell  133 core they reach -0.4 .",
    "these peak values are slightly offset from the cores in a direction opposite from the brightest diffuse emission , suggesting that the diffuse emission contaminates the spectral index measurements at the location of the cores but has a smaller effect on the side of the core where the diffuse emission is fainter .",
    "the measurements of the southern core , its jets , and the arc show the spectral index steepening with distance , although these regions may suffer from missing flux at 1.4  ghz and are therefore artificially steep .",
    "it is clear that abell  133 has been dynamically disturbed . at smaller radii , the surface brightness map shows an elliptical edge surrounding the core between 30 - 50  kpc ( figure  [ fig : edges_img ] ) , which is roughly aligned with the ellipticity at larger radii .",
    "the temperature map ( figure  [ fig : tmap_core]b ) , temperature profile ( figure  [ fig : ktprof ] ) , and density profile ( figure  [ fig : neprof ] ) show evidence for modest jumps at the location of the edge .",
    "the edge is well - described by a spheroidal discontinuous power - law density model , with a density jump of about 1.18 (   [ sec : profs ] ) , consistent with what is expected from gas sloshing in the core due to interactions with a merging subgroup .",
    "the temperature map of the core ( figure  [ fig : tmap_core]b ) shows two distinct temperature minima within the central cd galaxy , indicative of some small - scale dynamical process ( possibly a galaxy - galaxy merger ) .",
    "similar double peaks are seen in optical , uv , and nir images , although the position and rotation angle of the x - ray minima are offset from these features .",
    "this offset also suggests a dynamical process acting on the gas , such as gas sloshing or stripping , where the cool diffuse gas clouds have been displaced from the potential minima of their respective galaxies , while the collisionless stars remain undisturbed .",
    "thus , although the evidence for gas sloshing from the x - ray edges alone is not as conclusive as seen in some other systems ( e.g. , ngc  5098 , randall et al .  2009 ) , we conclude that there is strong evidence that abell  133 has been dynamically disturbed by an interloping subgroup , and we suggest that the elliptical edge in the surface brightness map is a gas sloshing edge , seen in simulations and in other galaxy groups and clusters , possibly viewed at a high angle of inclination such that the plane of the sloshing motion is not close to the plane of the sky , leading to the somewhat ragged appearance of the edge .    since gas sloshing requires a relatively massive perturber , we looked for evidence of substructure in abell  133 .",

    "we note that the interpretation of the cool clump to the north as stripped gas from a subcluster and the hot trail to the south as shock heated icm gas from the passage of the subcluster are not necessarily inconsistent , since the orbit of the subcluster may be curved as projected onto the plane of the sky ( although one might expect the elongation axis of the cool clump to point more to the south in such a unified model ) . finally , the hot spot to the southwest is equally well - described by a two temperature model with a poorly constrained high - temperature component at @xmath94  kev , or a thermal plus power - law model .",
    "either of these are consistent with a shock in this region , where the second component either detects shock heated gas or inverse compton ( ic ) emission from shock - accelerated particles .",
    "however , the presence of this hot spot is not confirmed by _ xmm - newton _ , and while this may be due to contamination by scattered light from bright , cooler regions due to _ xmm - newton s _ large psf we consider the _ chandra _ detection of the hot spot to be a marginal result .    from the combined evidence above",
    ", we propose a model where a merging subcluster has passed from the northeast to the southwest of the core , possibly leaving behind stripped gas to the northeast and shock heating the icm south of the core .",
    "the merger has elongated the x - ray isophotes at large radii in the northeast - southwest direction .",
    "the subcluster passed in front of or behind the core , initiating sloshing in the central gas in a plane at some inclination angle with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "since the putative spiral of sloshed gas is viewed from the side , it has an elliptical appearance with ragged edges .",
    "optical observations indicate a subcluster roughly 600  kpc southwest of the core , which seems a plausible candidate for the merging subcluster ( a second optically selected subcluster 300  kpc south of abell  133 is also a viable perturber candidate , although it is located too far to the east to explain the western hot spot shown in figure  [ fig : acisi_tmap ] as shock heated gas ) .",
    "f02 consider four possibilities for the formation of the x - ray plume indicated in figure  [ fig : xr_core ] : ( 1 ) a cooling wake , where hot icm gas is attracted into the wake of the moving cd galaxy and cools , ( 2 ) convective lift initiated by the displacement of core gas due to ram pressure stripping by a merging subcluster , ( 3 ) disruption of the cold front ( which they detect to the southeast ) due to kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , and ( 4 ) gas lifted by a buoyant bubble , in this case the radio relic in abell  133 . based on arguments presented in f02 and f04 , they conclude that the plume has most likely been formed due to uplifted gas by a buoyant bubble .",
    "examples of cool gas plumes capped , and presumably uplifted by , mushroom - cap shaped radio bubbles are seen in other systems ( e.g. , m87 , forman et al .",
    "2007 ; ngc  5813 , randall et al .",
    "2010 ) and reproduced in numerical simulations ( churazov et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the gas in the plume was once co - spatial with the gas in the core .",
    "if this is the case , we would expect the entropy in the core and in the tip of the plume to be similar , assuming that the plume gas has not conducted heat from or become mixed with the ambient icm .",
    "we therefore calculated the entropy for regions r1 and r3 ( indicated in figure  [ fig : regs ] ) using results from the two - temperature fits presented in table  [ tab : xspec ] and assuming a spherical geometry for r3 and a prolate spheroidal geometry for r1 , with the major axis in the plane of the sky .",
    "we find very similar entropy for each region , with @xmath95  kev  cm@xmath20 and @xmath96  kev  cm@xmath20 , supporting the idea that the gas has been uplifted ( however , not only are the statistical errors large , but there are additional systematic errors from the assumptions about the geometry , so this result is not conclusive ) .    as noted by f02",
    ", one concern is whether the bubble would be able to uplift the mass of gas in the plume and remain buoyant .",
    "roughly , we expect this to be the case if the mass of gas displaced by the bubble is greater than the mass of entrained gas . assuming a spherical geometry for the tip of the plume and a cylindrical geometry for the plume ( r3 and r2 in figure  [ fig : regs ] ) , we find densities and masses in these regions of @xmath97  @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100  @xmath98 , and @xmath101 .",
    "the total mass of the plume is therefore @xmath102 , which is consistent with the estimate given by f02 of @xmath103 . taking the average icm density at the location of the relic from figure  [ fig : neprof ] , and assuming an oblate spheroidal geometry for the relic , with the minor axis in the plane of the sky",
    ", we find that the mass of gas displaced by the bubble is approximately @xmath104 , more than 6 times the gas mass in the plume . as a check on this result",
    ", we did the same test with the eastern filament and eastern ear - shaped radio lobe in m87 ( forman et al.2007 ) .",
    "in the case of m87 , we find @xmath105 and @xmath106 , so that the displaced gas mass is roughly 3.5 times the mass in the plume , on the order of what we see in abell  133 where a very similar process seems to be at work .",
    "we conclude that , in principle , the bubble is capable of buoyantly lifting the cool gas in the plume , and that this is formation mechanism of the plume is fully consistent with the observations and with the conclusions of f04 .",
    "another possibility is that the plume was formed by the gas sloshing in the core .",
    "consider figure  7 in markevitch & ascasibar ( 2006 ) , which shows the time evolution of merger induced gas sloshing . at 1.9  gyr , a cool plume feature forms , which , if viewed from the right or left ( within the merger plane ) would look similar to the structure seen in abell  133 . in this interpretation ,",
    "the cool spot at the tip of the plume corresponds to the end of the spiral trail of the innermost cool gas in the simulations , and is extended along the line of sight .",
    "the radio relic could have formed at the core prior to the onset of sloshing , and subsequently dragged along by the sloshing motions of the gas , and thus appears to be at the tip of the plume .",
    "this requires that the perturber passed from the northwest to the southeast of the cluster ( in projection ) , on a trajectory perpendicular to that in our model proposed to explain the elliptical cold front edge . in this scenario , the southeastern subcluster reported by dalton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) provides a possible perturber candidate . although this model is plausible , it is difficult to test without detailed hydrodynamic simulations , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "f04 argue that the formation of the x - ray wings , indicated in figure  [ fig : xr_core ] , is due to a weak merger shock passing through the cool core from the southeast and disrupting it .",
    "their interpretation is based on a detection of a thermal gradient along the plume such that it is cooler northwest of the boundary defined by the wing features indicated in figure  [ fig : tmap_core]a , d , and a similar jump in temperature across the edge of the southwestern wing ( they do not detect a temperature difference across the northeastern wing ) .",
    "the edges of the wings therefore represent the edge of the shock front , which has been distorted as it passed through the dense core of abell  133 , giving it a curved appearance . the edge in the pseudo - pressure map north of the cd galaxy , which coincides with the northern edge of the wing features in the x - ray image ( compare the overlaid curve in figures  [ fig : tmap_core]a  &  [ fig : tmap_core]d ) , seems to support this scenario .",
    "however , as f04 point out , the `` evidence is marginal because it is based on keeping the temperatures of the projected hot component fixed , and the evidence disappears when all temperatures are left free '' . with the new _ chandra _ data , we are able to fit two - temperature models in these regions without fixing temperature parameters , thereby more accurately accounting for projection effects . as shown in table  [ tab : xspec ] , we find no evidence for a change in temperature between the core ( r1 ) , the plume ( r2 ) , and the tip of the plume ( r3 ) . in   [ sec : dxspec ] , we did a further test of this result by dividing the plume ( r2 ) into 7 contiguous regions , each with @xmath107 net counts , and fitting each region with a two - temperature model with fixed temperature and abundance for the projected hot component .",
    "we find that all of the fitted temperatures are consistent with 1.1  kev within 3@xmath3 , and most are consistent within 1@xmath3 .",
    "table  [ tab : wings ] gives our results from spectral fits across the wings , with regions defined as in f04 .",
    "the single - temperature fits show no evidence for upstream and downstream temperature differences , consistent with what f04 find .",
    "the two temperature fits show an _ increase _ in the lower temperature across the northern wing , but not the western ( this is in contrast to f04 , who find a _ decrease _ across the western wing , but not the northern ) . however , for the upstream regions the best - fitting higher temperatures are unreasonably hot and essentially unconstrained .",
    "we interpret this as indicating that the upstream regions are simply devoid of cool gas from the core , and the two temperature model instead mostly deprojects the inner 2 - 3  kev gas from 5 - 6  kev gas at larger radii ( seen in the temperature map in figure  [ fig : tmap ] ) , which is only poorly measured in these fits . alternatively , since the upstream regions are coincident with the radio relic , the measurement of such high temperatures may indicate the presence of very hot gas within the bubbles , or could be the result of fitting a thermal model to a non - thermal component , presumably arising from ic scattering of the cmb by synchrotron - emitting particles within the relic ( see the discussion of region r4 in   [ sec : dxspec ] ) .",
    "either interpretation is consistent with the upstream regions corresponding to x - ray cavities created by the radio relic pushing out the cool central gas in these regions , as suggested by brzan et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2008 ) , creating the wing morphology seen in the surface brightness map .",
    "this is also consistent with the detection of the edge in the pseudo - pressure map along the northern edge of the x - ray wings since the decrease in x - ray pressure in this region can be attributed to the additional support from the radio - filled cavities .",
    "since we find cooler low - temperature gas downstream in the northern wing we conclude that our results are inconsistent with the f04 model of a shock passing through the core from the southeast , but are consistent with the wing features arising from the displacement of cool gas by the buoyantly rising radio - filled relic .",
    "there have been at least two suggestions as to the origin of the diffuse radio source in abell  133 ( which we refer to as the `` relic '' or `` northern lobe '' , depending on context ) .",
    "first , it may be a radio relic , as suggested by its steep spectral index ( it is the third steepest source in the sample of 24 objects from brzan et al .",
    "2008 ) and non - central location ( s01 ) .",
    "however , some of the properties of the source seem to be at variance with radio relics observed in other clusters .",
    "while we have argued that abell  133 is dynamically disturbed , there is no clear indication of a merger shock , which is thought to be required to re - accelerate the radio emitting particles ( although see the discussion of figure  [ fig : acisi_tmap ] in   [ sec : dynamics ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the integrated polarization is low ( @xmath108% ; s01 ) and shows complicated spatial variations ( f02 ) , in contrast to most radio relics .",
    "second , this feature may be an old detached radio lobe associated with the central source in the cd galaxy ( rizza et al .",
    "2000 ) , similar to the attached eastern `` ear '' lobe in m87 ( owen et al .",
    "2000 ; forman et al .  2007 ) and consistent with our above conclusion that the x - ray plume was formed via buoyant lift by a rising bubble .",
    "however , in such sources one typically finds two lobes produced by a double - sided jet ( although there are examples of single - lobed systems , e.g. , bagchi et al .",
    "in this section we re - examine the nature of this source in the context of our conclusions about the dynamical state of abell  133 and the large - scale double - lobed morphology revealed by deeper radio observations ( figure  [ fig : rad_imgs ] ) .      since we have concluded that the x - ray plume was formed due to buoyant lift of cool gas by the rising relic , it is of interest to compare the relic age to the buoyant rise time .",
    "we can estimate a lower - limit on rise - time of the relic by assuming that the bubble rises with an average speed equal to the sound speed in the gas . for a local ambient icm temperature of 2.3  kev ( consistent with results in table  [ tab : xspec ] )",
    "the sound speed is 782  @xmath109 , giving a lower - limit rise - time of @xmath110  yr .",
    "this is a lower limit since the bubble need not rise in the plane of the sky , and since the bubble may rise at some fraction @xmath111 of the sound speed . if we take average values and assume that @xmath112 ( as suggested by churazov et al .",
    "2001 ) , and that the bubble rises along a vector 45@xmath9  from the plane of the sky , the rise time increases to @xmath113  yr .",
    "brzan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimate the synchrotron age of the radio relic to be @xmath114  yr .",
    "thus , the lower limits placed on @xmath115 and @xmath116 allow @xmath117 , as expected ( i.e. , the age of the relic should be more than the time it took to rise to its current position ) . however , using low frequency radio observations , particularly at 29.9  mhz ( finlay & jones 1973 ) and 80  mhz ( slee 1995 ) , s01 estimate a synchrotron age of @xmath118  yr , close to our estimated lower limit on @xmath115 , but shorter than the `` average '' rise time of @xmath113  yr given above . based on their value of @xmath116 and the assumption that the relic likely does not rise in the plane of the sky , s01",
    "conclude that the rise time and the age of the relic are inconsistent , and suggest that the relic may have come from the galaxy directly west of the core in abell  133 ( visible , e.g. , in figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]a ) rather than from the cd galaxy itself .",
    "more recent _ chandra _ observations make it clear that the relic has in fact risen from the central cd galaxy , inconsistent with the s01 s suggestion that the relic has come from another galaxy just outside of the core .",
    "we note that the estimate of the relic age by s01 may be inaccurate , both because the low frequency radio observations have very poor resolution ( @xmath119@xmath9 ) and fluxes must be corrected by subtracting off the contribution from other sources in the field ( which requires some assumption about spectral indices ) , and because the flux in the region of the relic may be contaminated by the putative background lobe discussed in ",
    "[ sec : lobes ] ( although an estimate of the latter effect is difficult given the data we consider here ) . as a check on the relic age estimate of s01",
    ", we used the model applied , e.g. , in parma et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and giacintucci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , including the new radio data to estimate the synchrotron age .",
    "our results are fully consistent with those of s01 .",
    "we conclude that an improved estimate of the relic age will require additional low frequency radio data below 74  mhz ( e.g. , from _ lofar _ ) .",
    "if we assume that the relic age given by s01 is accurate , the most natural solution to the inconsistency noted by s01 is that the bubble rises along a vector that is close to the plane of the sky , so that the rise time is close to the lower limit and consistent with @xmath118  yr . that this is the case is suggested by the x - ray images alone ,",
    "specifically by the fact that we see cavities in the cooler central icm that are co - spatial with the relic ( detailed spectral fits indicate that the cavities are devoid of cooler @xmath120  kev gas , see   [ sec : dxspec ] ) . if the relic was much in front of or behind the core , such that it was beyond the cooler gas encompassed by the edge indicated in figure  [ fig : edges_img ] , we would nt expect to see cavities in the cool gas ( in fact",
    ", we would not expect to see cavities at all , since the lower surface brightnesses at larger radii make density contrasts more difficult to detect [ brzan et al .",
    "if the central gas were significantly extended along the line of sight the bubble may have risen along this extension , although not only would it still be difficult to detect the bubble for large inclination angles of the extension due to the large column density of cool gas behind ( or in front of ) the bubble , but , as we show in   [ sec : profs ] , the surface brightness profile is well - described by an ellipsoidal density model with the major axis in the plane of the sky .",
    "thus , we conclude that the relic has likely risen in a direction that is close to the plane of the sky , resolving the inconsistency between @xmath115 and @xmath116 reported by s01 .",
    "however , we note that our interpretation of abell  133 as a dynamically disturbed system can in principle resolve a situation where @xmath121 , and it is of general interest to consider these effects .",
    "first , the cosmic ray particles in radio relics are thought to be re - energized by compression from merger shocks , as proposed by enlin & gopal - krishna ( 2001 ) .",
    "if the particles have been re - accelerated due to a merger with a subgroup , the true age of the relic will be larger than the synchrotron age estimated from the current radio luminosity and spectral index ( however , in   [ sec : dynamics ] we showed that for the potential perturbing subclusters the time since the merger is @xmath122  yr , also longer than the s01 estimate of @xmath116 ) .",
    "second , we note that the close passage of a perturbing subgroup , which has initiated gas sloshing in the core , can in principle decrease the rise time required to get to the current position",
    ". the passage will temporarily deepen the gravitational potential , causing gas to flow towards the subgroup and increasing the buoyant force on the bubble . to estimate the strength of this effect ,",
    "we used the mass model for abell  133 described in   [ sec : dynamics ] to estimate the duration and speed of the core passage phase of a putative subcluster . to maximize the effect , we assumed an impact parameter of 37  kpc ( equal to the projected distance between the relic and the agn ) and that the subcluster mass profile at small radii is the same as that of abell  133 , truncated at 100  kpc .",
    "( although the subcluster s total mass will be less than that of the main cluster it may be more concentrated , giving more mass in the core",
    ". however the core of the subcluster can not be more massive than the core of the main cluster otherwise the main core would have been completely destroyed by the merger , so we maximize the effect by making the core and subcluster masses equal . )",
    "we find an average speed at core passage of @xmath123  @xmath109 .",
    "the buoyant acceleration of the bubble is @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the density in the bubble , @xmath126 is the density of the ambient icm , and @xmath127 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "we assume that @xmath128 , so that @xmath129 .",
    "the maximum velocity the bubble can attain is determined by the drag force , which is given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the cross - sectional area of the bubble and @xmath132 is the drag coefficient ( we use @xmath133 , see churazov et al .",
    "2001 ) . therefore",
    ", balancing the buoyant force @xmath134 with @xmath135 gives a maximum bubble velocity of @xmath136 where @xmath137  kpc is the semi - minor axis of the bubble .",
    "using the above model and starting the bubble at rest 5  kpc from the core gives @xmath138  yr neglecting the contribution from the subcluster , and @xmath139  yr including the subcluster .",
    "thus , even a favorable estimate of the subcluster s influence on the rise time gives gives only a 16% effect , insufficient to reduce the average rise time enough to be consistent with the estimate of @xmath116 from s01 .",
    "our proposed merger / gas sloshing model can have some additional consequences for the radio observations , in particular when considering the morphology of the relic and jet . as noted by s01 , the 1.4  ghz image ( figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]a ) shows a clear separation between the loop feature extending east of the abell  133 core and the filamentary radio relic .",
    "however , at lower frequencies the jet and relic seem to connect ( figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]c ) , and rizza et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report a connection in their 1.4  ghz observations .",
    "if we assume that features are indeed connected , one then needs to explain not only the apparent misalignment between the inner jet ( which points east by northeast ) and the direction of the bubble from the core ( north by northwest ) , but also the lack of a counter jet and relic as observed in other systems ( e.g. , m87 ) .",
    "we note that not only can gas sloshing , in principle , push around the lighter radio plasma ( without affecting the cooler , denser , x - ray plume ) , deforming the jet and giving rise to some of the fine filaments seen in the high - resolution radio images , but the additional buoyant force from a passing subcluster can change the rise trajectory of buoyant bubbles , possibly pushing two bubbles together as they rise from the core ( such `` misalignment '' of buoyantly rising bubbles is clearly observed in other systems , e.g. , m87 [ forman et al .  2007 ] ) . to test this effect",
    ", we applied the same model we used to calculate the effect of the subcluster on the buoyant rise time ( described above ) .",
    "we used a smaller velocity at core passage of 1000  @xmath109and evolved the bubbles starting just prior to core passage to maximize the effect .",
    "first , we consider the case where the subcluster moves in the same plane as the jets .",
    "the resulting trajectories of the bubbles are shown in figure  [ fig:2d_bubbles ] . in this figure ,",
    "the subcluster passes along the line @xmath140 , moving from left to right . without the influence of the subcluster ,",
    "the bubbles rise buoyantly along the @xmath141-axis .",
    "we see that while the subcluster has a significant effect on the rise trajectories , the final separation between the bubbles is too large for them to overlap .",
    "however , if we view this case at an angle such that the initial direction of the jets ( and the direction of motion of the subcluster ) is close to our line of sight ( consistent with our suggestion that the motion of the perturbing subcluster is not in the plane of the sky ) , then the bubbles can overlap in projection ( see the dotted lines in figure  [ fig:2d_bubbles ] ) . in this projection",
    ", the jets still point along the @xmath141-axis , giving rise to a misalignment between the jet direction and the bubble trajectory , similar to what is observed ( figure  [ fig : rad_imgs]a ) .",
    "therefore , the additional buoyant force of a merging subcluster can , in principle , address the primary objection to the interpretation of the relic as a detached radio lobe ( namely that only one lobe is observed ) , although there are some difficulties with the details of our model . in this simulation , the rise time of the bubbles is @xmath142  yr , and the final true separation between the bubbles and the core is @xmath143  kpc .",
    "the separation places the bubbles just outside the central cool gas , although , as we argue above , the x - ray images suggest that the relic has evacuated cavities in the cool central gas , and therefore can not be much more than @xmath144  kpc from the core and must have risen close to the plane of the sky ( since the projected separation from the core is @xmath145  kpc ) .",
    "thus , while this model can potentially reproduce some of the observed radio features , it is not fully consistent with the observations ( although we note that sloshing induced gas motions can in principle add to the rising speed of the bubble and resolve this inconsistency ) .",
    "we also considered the case where the merger axis of the subcluster is perpendicular to the plane defined by the inner jets .",
    "the subcluster passes by the core , equidistant from each bubble , so the effect on each bubble is the same and the trajectories are symmetric . the resulting trajectory for a rising bubble is shown in figure  [ fig:3d_bubbles ] .",
    "the results are similar to the case where the subcluster passes parallel to the inner jet axis : while the additional buoyant force from the subcluster can significantly affect the rise trajectories and give a possible projection where the bubbles are co - spatial and separated from the central agn , the final distance from the core ( @xmath146  kpc ) puts the bubbles outside of the central cool gas and is inconsistent with the observation of cavities in the gas .",
    "we conclude that , although we have shown that an interloping subcluster can in principle have a significant effect on the morphology and evolution of buoyant radio bubbles , our simplistic model fails to reproduce what we see in abell  133 ( although the added effect of sloshing - induced gas motions could resolve this discrepancy ) .",
    "the overall structure of the low - resolution , low - frequency radio images ( figure  [ fig : rad_imgs ] ) and spectral index maps ( figure  [ fig : index_maps ] ) is consistent with what one would expect for a double - lobed radio galaxy .",
    "optical observations place the galaxy core at a redshift of @xmath15 , much larger than the redshift of abell  133 ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "however , the high - resolution 1.4  ghz radio image reveals the bright , complex relic in the region of the northern lobe , and x - ray observations unambiguously associate the relic with cool central gas in abell  133 .",
    "we are therefore left with three possibilities : ( 1 ) the radio galaxy is associated with abell  133 , and the radio core overlaps with the optical source by chance , as does the northern lobe with the relic ; ( 2 ) the core and jet features are at @xmath15 , but the lobes are unassociated with this source ( with at least the northern lobe / relic being in abell  133 ) , and the alignment between the jets / arc and the lobes is coincidental ; and ( 3 ) there is a giant background radio galaxy , oriented such that the northern lobe overlies the relic in abell  133 .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to distinguish between these three scenarios with the current data ( although we searched for a surface brightness depression associated with the southern lobe and found none , the low x - ray surface brightness at this radius would make any putative cavity associated with the lobe extremely difficult to detect [ brzan et al .",
    "2009 ] , so the non - detection can not be used to argue that the southern lobe is a background source ) . out of these three possibilities",
    ", we suggest that the third option of a double - lobed background radio galaxy is most likely since it requires the smallest number of random coincidences .    assuming that the radio observations represent a radio galaxy at @xmath0 , we find that the total extent of the lobes is 1.6  mpc ( compared to 400  kpc if the galaxy were at the redshift of abell  133 ) .",
    "this is within the range of what has been found for other giant radio galaxies ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "2001 find a strong drop in the number of sources larger than @xmath148  mpc ) .",
    "we do not measure ic emission in the region of the southern lobe , and therefore can not infer the energy density in electrons ( @xmath149 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath150 ) , but the size of the radio galaxy ( which correlates linearly with these properties , isobe et al .",
    "2009 ) implies @xmath151  ergs  @xmath98 and @xmath152  ergs  @xmath98 .",
    "flux contamination from a putative background lobe may explain some of the properties of the relic in abell  133 that seem to be at variance with relics observed in other clusters .",
    "blending with a background source may well lead to the complex polarization map presented by f02 .",
    "additionally , since the background lobe is expected to be old ( more than @xmath153  yrs ) and to not contribute much flux at high frequencies ( as is typical for giant radio galaxy lobes ) it may steepen the combined spectrum . to estimate the effects of the background lobe",
    ", we assume that it has the same flux as the southern lobe .",
    "( note that this assumption need not be valid , since opposite radio lobes can vary significantly in brightness .",
    "an example of an extreme case is the single - lobed giant radio galaxy reported by bagchi et al .  [",
    "we find that the background lobe contributes 13% , 11% , 7% , and 3% of the total flux in the region of the relic in the 74  mhz , high - resolution 330  mhz , low - resolution 330  mhz , and low - resolution 1.4  ghz images respectively .",
    "these flatten the spectral indices of the relic ( table  [ tab : sindex ] ) by 2.2% for @xmath154 , 2.9% for @xmath155 , and 0.7% for @xmath156 , in each case within or on the order of the 1@xmath3 error range .",
    "we conclude that the background northern lobe will not significantly alter the spectral index for the relic unless it is significantly brighter than the southern lobe .    in conclusion ,",
    "we find it most likely that the large - scale double - lobed feature represents a background giant radio galaxy , with the northern lobe obscured by the brighter relic in abell  133 .",
    "the nature of the radio relic remains unclear .",
    "its morphology and association with a ( presumably uplifted ) plume of cool gas is very similar to the eastern `` ear '' radio lobe feature in m87 ( forman et al .",
    "the putative background northern lobe does not significantly flatten the spectral index of the relic , and it is unclear whether it can explain the unusual polarization map presented in f02 . the steep index suggests a radio relic classification , and while we do not find clear evidence of a merger shock , which would be required to re - accelerate the particles in the relic , we have argued that abell  133 is a dynamically disturbed system , and find some evidence for shock heated gas south of the cluster core .",
    "the free - fall time of the gas at the tip of the x - ray plume is @xmath157  yr , a factor of two larger than the most likely rise time of the bubble of @xmath158  yr , so that the plume may persist for some time after it has decoupled from the buoyant action of the relic . in the case of the double - lobed radio galaxy interpretation",
    ", we have shown that the passage of a merging subcluster can in principle move the bubbles buoyantly so that they overlap in projection and give something similar to what is observed , although in our simple model the bubbles end up too far from the core to produce the observed radio cavities .",
    "we conclude that the most likely interpretation is that the diffuse source is a relatively young radio relic , re - energized by the dynamical activity in abell  133 .",
    "its youth not only explains its proximity to the core ( and its association with the x - ray plume ) , but it would require less energy to re - accelerate the younger particle population , in which case a weak shock or even gas sloshing may provide the necessary energy to compress the relic .",
    "we have presented results from deep _ chandra _ and _ vla _ observations of the cool core cluster abell  133 .",
    "the elliptical x - ray isophotes , the offset between the cool gas and cd galaxy , optical substructure detections , and a weak elliptical sloshing edge ( which is sharpest to the southeast ) suggest that abell  133 is dynamically disturbed .",
    "the detection of multiple peaks in the cd galaxy at optical , nir , and uv wavelengths and corresponding minima in the x - ray temperature map suggests an ongoing galaxy - galaxy merger , and the offset between the cool gas minima and the peaks at longer wavelengths suggest bulk gas motion in the core , consistent with gas sloshing from a recent subcluster merger .",
    "the large scale temperature map reveals a cool clump of gas to the north , possibly indicating stripped gas from a merging subcluster , and somewhat higher temperature gas to the south ( as compared to the north ) , possibly due to icm gas heating by a merger shock .",
    "although optical tests for substructure are inconclusive , there is evidence for substructure to the south and southwest of the core .",
    "we suggest a model where a merging subcluster ( possibly one of the optically detected substructures ) has passed southeast of the core , leaving the cool clump of stripped gas to the north , shock heating the icm in the south , and initiating gas sloshing in the core .",
    "since the subcluster does not move in the plane of the sky , we view the sloshing spiral ( seen in simulations and observations of other systems ) at an angle , resulting in the ragged elliptical surface brightness edge we identify as a cold front .",
    "we find that the bird - like morphology of the central gas can be fully explained by the presence of the diffuse radio source in abell  133 .",
    "the plume of cool gas is buoyantly lifted by the relic , as seen in simulations and observations of other systems , and in agreement with previous work .",
    "our results regarding the x - ray wings are inconsistent with the previously suggested model where they arise from a shock passing through the cool core since we rule out temperature jumps across the putative shock front . instead , the wings are created by x - ray cavities occupied by the radio relic on either side of the plume .    in the radio , we identify a previously unreported @xmath159  mpc background giant radio galaxy at @xmath0 .",
    "the northern lobe of this source overlaps with the relic in abell  133 , contributing modestly to the total flux in this region and marginally affecting measured spectral indices .",
    "the nature of the steep - spectrum relic source in abell  133 remains unclear .",
    "the agreement between the lower limit on the rise time and synchrotron age of the relic , along with its association with x - ray cavities in the central cool gas , suggest that the relic has risen along a vector close to the plane of the sky , forming the cool x - ray plume via buoyant lift .",
    "x - ray spectral fits in the region of the relic indicate the presence of either high - temperature gas or non - thermal emission .",
    "although the measured photon index is flatter than the spectral slope inferred from radio observations , indicating that the non - thermal emission is not from ic scattering of the cmb by the radio emitting particles , the slopes are consistent within the ( large ) 90% confidence intervals . we have argued that it is most likely a young relic , possibly re - energized by a weak shock or gas sloshing associated with the recent merger , although other interpretations remain plausible .",
    "we have shown that , in principle , the additional buoyant force of a passing subcluster can significantly affect the trajectories of buoyantly rising radio bubbles and explain the drastic misalignment of the eastern inner jet and the rise direction of the relic , although the details of our simple model do not fully agree with the observations in the case of abell  133 .",
