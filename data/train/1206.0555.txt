    "in recent years numerous studies have underlined the complex role of human hand in motor organization , with particular attention to grasping .",
    "it was shown that individuated finger motions were phylogenetically superimposed on basic grasping movements  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is possible to individuate a reduced number of coordination patterns ( _ synergies _ ) which constrain both joint motions and force exertions of multiple fingers  @xcite .",
    "these constraints can be related to both biomechanics factors  @xcite and synchronization between different motor units  @xcite .",
    "coordination patterns were analyzed by means of multivariate statistical methods over a grasping data set , revealing that a limited amount of so - called _ eigenpostures _ or principal components ( pcs ) @xcite , or otherwise `` statistically identified kinematic coordination patterns '' @xcite , are sufficient to explain a great part of hand pose variability .",
    "in addition , a gradient in _ eigenpostures _ was identified  @xcite , showing that lower order pcs take into account covariation patterns for metacarpophalangeal ( mcp ) and interphalangeal ( ip ) joints , which are mainly responsible for coarse hand opening and closing , while higher order pcs are used for fine hand shape adjustments .",
    "these studies and results on human hand in grasping tasks suggest that there exist some inner hand representations of increasing complexity , which allow to reduce the number of degrees of freedom ( dofs ) to be used according to the desired level of approximation . from a _",
    "point of view , this idea was then adopted in robotics to define simplified approaches for the design and control of artificial hands @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , from the _ observability _ point of view , this fact also suggests that it is possible to reduce the number of independent dofs to be measured in order to obtained the hand pose estimation for a given level of approximation .",
    "an application of this concept was developed in @xcite for hand avatar animation . in this paper",
    ", we exploit the information embedded in a known grasp set , which expresses the postural constraints for multi - finger joints , to improve the reconstruction of the hand posture in static grasping tasks when only a limited and inaccurate number of measures are available by low - cost sensing gloves for gesture measurement  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "`` glove - based '' devices or `` sensing gloves '' , i.e.  devices for hand pose reconstruction based on measurements of few geometric features of the hand , provide useful interfaces for human - machine and haptic interaction in many fields like , for example , virtual reality , musical performance , video games , teleoperation and robotics  @xcite",
    ". however , the widespread commercialization of electronic gloves imposes limits on the production costs in terms of the amount and the quality of the sensors adopted . as a consequence",
    ", the correctness of the hand pose reconstruction obtained by these devices might be compromised .",
    "the objective of this paper and its companion  @xcite is to provide new tools to improve the design and performance of sensing gloves by exploiting the knowledge on how humans most frequently use their hands .    in this paper , partially based on  @xcite , the aim is to provide hand pose estimation technique based on bayesinference which optimizes the performance for a given glove design .",
    "two different approaches have been followed to achieve this goal .",
    "the first one solves a constrained optimization problem of multinormal probability density function ( pdf ) , and it is mainly suited when accurately measured data is available .",
    "the second approach deals with noisy measured data and relies on classic minimum variance estimation ( mve ) . to validate these methods we consider measurements from a set of grasp postures acquired with a low cost sensing glove and compare the achieved hand pose reconstruction with reference measures provided by a very accurate optical tracking system .",
    "effects of noise are also taken into account and new simulations w.r.t .",
    "@xcite have been conducted .",
    "statistical analyses of both experimental and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the here proposed procedures .    in  @xcite , we consider the dual problem of optimal design of pose sensing gloves , based on a suitable cost function which combines the _ a priori _ information and measures .",
    "simulations are reported where the estimation procedures described in this paper are applied to the measures provided by the optimally designed glove .",
    "we first consider the case that individual sensing elements in the glove can be designed so as to measure a linear combination of joint angles , and provide , for given _ a priori _ information and fixed number of measurements , the optimal design minimizing in average the reconstruction error .",
    "we then discuss the case that only single - dof sensors are used in the glove .",
    "finally an hybrid design which combines continuous and discrete measures and expresses a trade - off between quality and feasibility is proposed .",
    "let us consider a set of measures @xmath0 given by a sensing glove . by using a @xmath1 degree of freedom kinematic hand model , we shall assume a linear relationship between joint variables @xmath2 and measurements @xmath3 given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is a full rank matrix which represents the relationship between measures and joint angles , and @xmath7 is a vector of measurement noise .",
    "the goal is to determine the hand posture , i.e.  the joint angles @xmath8 , by using a set of measures @xmath3 whose number is lower than the number of dofs describing the kinematic hand model in use .",
    "equation   represents a system where there are fewer equations than unknowns and hence is compatible with an infinite number of solutions , described e.g.  as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pseudo - inverse of matrix @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the null space basis of matrix @xmath11 and @xmath13 is a free vector of parameters . among these possible solutions ,",
    "the least - squared solution resulting from the pseudo - inverse of matrix @xmath11 for system   is a vector of minimum euclidean norm given by @xmath14    however , the hand pose reconstruction resulting from   can be very far from the real one .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to improve on the accuracy of the pose reconstruction , choosing , among the possible solution to  , the most likely hand pose .",
    "the basic idea is to exploit the fact that human hands , although very complex and possibly different in size and shape , share many commonalities in how they are shaped and used in frequent everyday tasks .",
    "indeed , studies on the human hand in grasping tasks showed that finger motions are strongly correlated according to some coordination patterns referred to as synergies in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show how to improve hand pose reconstruction by exploiting the _ a priori _ information obtained by collecting a large number @xmath15 of grasp postures @xmath16 , consisting of @xmath1 dofs , into a matrix  @xmath17 .",
    "this information can be summarized in a covariance matrix @xmath18 , which is a symmetric matrix computed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a matrix @xmath21 whose columns contain the mean values for each joint angle arranged in vector @xmath22 .      in this section ,",
    "we initially consider the case that measurement noise is negligible .",
    "the hand pose estimation can be improved w.r.t .",
    "that obtained by  , by exploiting the _ a priori _ information , that we will assume to be a multivariate normal distribution , on a set of grasping poses built beforehand and embedded in the covariance matrix @xmath23 .",
    "the best estimation of the hand posture is given by choosing as optimality criterion the maximization of the _ probability density function _",
    "( pdf ) of a multivariate normal distribution , expressed by ( @xcite ) @xmath24 this is equivalent to solving the following optimal problem : @xmath25    it is interesting to give a geometrical interpretation of the cost function in  , which expresses the square of the mahalanobis distance  @xcite . the concept of mahalanobis distance , which takes into account data covariance structure , is widely exploited in statistics , e.g.  in pc analysis , mainly for outlier detection @xcite .",
    "accordingly , to assess if a test point belongs to a known data set , whose distribution defines an hyper - ellipsoid , we take into account both its closeness to the centroid of data set and the direction of the test point w.r.t .  the centroid itself . in other words ,",
    "the more samples are distributed along this direction , the more probably the test point belongs to the data set even if it is further from the center .",
    "taking into account  , the optimal problem defined in   becomes @xmath26 by using classic optimization procedures we obtain @xmath27 and , substituting in  , after some algebras , the estimation of the hand joint angles is @xmath28h^\\dagger y + \\nonumber\\\\ & + n_h(n_h^{t}p_o^{-1}n_h)^{-1}n_h^{t}p_o^{-1}\\mu_o\\ , .",

    "introduce a new variable @xmath29 and consider @xmath30 by imposing @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 this solution can be easily shown to be equivalent to  .    finally , it is interesting to observe that the least - squared and pdf maximization methods have a direct application in case of only single - dof sensors are used in the devices ( discrete sensing gloves ) . in this case",

    "this method minimizes a cost functional which expresses the weighted euclidean norm of deviations , i.e.  cost functional @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is an arbitrary , semidefinite positive matrix .    under the hypothesis that @xmath44 has zero mean and gaussian distribution with covariance matrix @xmath45",

    "the estimation @xmath48 can be obtained as in  @xcite by @xmath49 where matrix @xmath50 is the _ a posteriori _ covariance matrix , which has to be minimized to increase information about the system .",
    "this result represents a very common procedure in applied optimal estimation when there is redundant sensor information . in under -",
    "determined problems , it is only thanks to the _ a priori _ information , represented by @xmath23 and @xmath51 , that equation   can be applied ( indeed , @xmath52 is not invertible ) .    when @xmath45 tends to assume very small values , the solution described in equation might encounter numerical problems .",
