    "neutrino masses and mixing are well - established by the observations of neutrino oscillations in solar , atmospheric and long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments , which are well - accommodated in the standard framework of three - neutrino mixing , where the three active neutrinos @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are superpositions of three massive neutrinos @xmath5 , @xmath6",
    ", @xmath7 with respective masses @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( see refs.@xcite ) . in this framework there are two independent squared - mass differences : the small solar @xmath11 and the larger atmospheric @xmath12 , which can be interpreted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .    however , the reactor @xcite , gallium @xcite and lsnd @xcite anomalies indicate that the neutrino mixing framework may need an extension in order to accommodate short - baseline oscillations , where @xmath16 is the source - detector distance and @xmath17 is the neutrino energy . since the oscillations generated by a squared - mass difference @xmath1 is observable for @xmath18 , short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are sensitive to @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are characterized by a ratio @xmath20 which makes them sensitive to @xmath21 . ] due to at least one additional squared - mass difference , @xmath22 , which is much larger than @xmath23 ( see the reviews in refs .",
    "the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite is a deficit of the rate of @xmath24-induced events observed in short - baseline reactor neutrino experiments in comparison with that expected from the calculation of the reactor neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "the gallium neutrino anomaly @xcite is a shortage of @xmath2-induced events measured at an average distance of about 1 m in the gallium radioactive source experiments gallex @xcite and sage @xcite with respect to the rate of @xmath2-induced events expected from the well - measured activity of the radioactive source .",
    "the lsnd anomaly is the observation of short - baseline @xmath25 transitions @xcite .",
    "the additional squared - mass difference required to explain these anomalies with neutrino oscillations necessitates the existence of at least an additional massive neutrino at the ev scale . since from the lep measurement of the invisible width of the @xmath26 boson @xcite",
    "we know that there are only three active neutrinos , in the flavor basis the additional massive neutrinos correspond to sterile neutrinos @xcite , which do not have standard weak interactions .",
    "sterile neutrinos are singlets of the standard model gauge symmetries which can couple to the active neutrinos through the lagrangian mass term . in practice",
    "there are bounds on the active - sterile mixing , but there is no bound on the number of sterile neutrinos and on their mass scales .",
    "therefore the existence of sterile neutrinos is investigated at different mass scalesmsm ) @xcite ( see the reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; sterile neutrinos at the mev scale @xcite ; sterile neutrinos at the electroweak scale @xcite or above it @xcite , whose effects may be seen at lhc and other high - energy colliders . ] . in this paper",
    "we consider the simplest 3 + 1 extension of three - neutrino mixing in which the three standard massive neutrinos @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are assumed to have masses much smaller than 1 ev and there is an additional neutrino @xmath27 with mass @xmath28 . in this framework ,",
    "the squared - mass difference @xmath29 can generate short - baseline oscillations which explain the above - mentioned anomalies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the flavor basis , besides the three active neutrinos @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , there is a sterile neutrino @xmath30 which has a large mixing with @xmath27 and small mixings with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the elements of the @xmath31 unitary mixing matrix @xmath32 must be such that @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "in this paper we consider the results of the miniboone experiment @xcite , which has been done to check the indication in favor of short - baseline neutrino oscillations given by the lsnd anomaly .",
    "the miniboone experiment operated first in neutrino mode , searching for @xmath37 transitions .",
    "the results `` showed no evidence of an excess of electron - like events for neutrino energies above 475 mev '' @xcite , which cover the same @xmath38 range of the lsnd experiment . on the other hand",
    ", the data showed `` unexplained electron - like events in the reconstructed neutrino energy range from 200 to 475 mev '' @xcite .",
    "this is a sizable excess of @xmath2-like events in the three energy bins below 475 mev which has been called the _",
    "miniboone low - energy anomaly_.    the second part of the miniboone experiment was operated in antineutrino mode , searching for @xmath25 transitions .",
    "the final results @xcite showed a small excess of @xmath24-like events over the background for reconstructed neutrino energies above 475 mev and a sizable excess of @xmath24-like events in the three energy bins below 475 mev which is compatible with the low - energy anomaly in neutrino mode .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite suggested that at least part of the miniboone low - energy excess could be due to events which have a larger neutrino energy and are interpreted as low - energy events because the reconstruction of the neutrino energy from the measured electron energy and scattering angle did not take into account multinucleon interactions in the neutrino - nucleus charged - current interactions .",
    "the multinucleon emission channel has attracted much attention in the last years .",
    "the inclusion of this channel in the quasielastic cross section was suggested @xcite as the possible explanation of the miniboone ccqe total cross section on carbon @xcite , observed to be too large with respect to theoretical predictions employing the standard value of the axial mass .",
    "the miniboone experiment , as well as other experiments involving cherenkov detectors , defines as a charged current quasielastic - like event one in which only a final charged lepton is detected .",
    "the ejection of a single nucleon ( a genuine quasielastic event ) is only one possibility , and one must consider as well events involving for instance a correlated nucleon pair from which the partner nucleon is also ejected , as discussed first in refs .",
    "the inclusion in the quasielastic cross section of events in which several nucleons are ejected ( @xmath39-@xmath40 excitations ) , leads to an increase over the genuine quasielastic value .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite argued that this is the likely explanation of the miniboone data , showing that their evaluation can account for the excess in the cross section without any modification of the axial mass .",
    "this suggestion triggered a new interest of the neutrino scattering and oscillation communities for the multinucleon emission channel .",
    "beyond the first miniboone data @xcite , the appearance of new measurements of charged current quasielastic - like cross sections @xcite , of analyses of the hadronic final states @xcite and of the vertex and recoil energies deposited in the detector @xcite is leading to a mounting experimental evidence of the multinucleon effects in neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "several theoretical works @xcite have analyzed the role of the multinucleon excitations in the evaluation of the neutrino - nucleus cross sections at miniboone , t2k and minerva energies .",
    "originally , this channel was not included in the monte carlo generators used for the analyses of the neutrino cross sections and oscillations experiments .",
    "today there is an effort to include this @xmath39-@xmath40 channel in several event generators  @xcite . as was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the influence of the multinucleon channel also manifests in the problem of the neutrino energy reconstruction @xcite .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite also showed how it affects the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "applied to the miniboone data this is the object of the present work .    in this paper",
    "we study the impact of the multinucleon interactions in neutrino - nucleus charged - current scattering on the fit of the electron appearance miniboone data in terms of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the miniboone collaboration discussed briefly an approximate implementation of the multinucleon interactions in ref .",
    "they showed that the change of the minimum @xmath41 value is small and they concluded that multinucleon interactions do not significantly change the oscillation fit .",
    "however , the change of the minimum @xmath41 value due to multinucleon interactions obtained by the miniboone collaboration is a small increase , whereas we expect a decrease from a better fit of the low - energy excess . in this paper",
    "we examine this problem and we study quantitatively to which extent the results of the oscillation fit of the miniboone data is affected by the multinucleon interactions .    the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ method ]",
    "we describe the method that we adopted in order to take into account the multinucleon contribution to the neutrino - nucleus charged - current interactions in the analysis of miniboone data . in section  [ two ] we present the results of the fit of miniboone data taking into account multinucleon interactions in the simplest framework of two - neutrino mixing . in section",
    "[ 3 + 1 ] we discuss the implications of the multinucleon interactions in the analysis of miniboone data for the global fit of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data in the framework of 3 + 1 neutrino mixing .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in principle , the multinucleon interactions should be included in the monte carlo generator with which one simulates the events predicted in the experiment without and with neutrino oscillations .",
    "however , since we do not have access to the miniboone monte carlo generator , we adopted an approach which allows the treatment of the multinucleon emission channel , as well as the quasielastic and the pion production channels through the theoretical model of ref .",
    "this model has been successful @xcite to reproduce the miniboone data on the neutrino @xcite and antineutrino @xcite quasielastic - like cross sections , as well as the pion production data measured by miniboone @xcite and the t2k data on muon - neutrino @xcite and electron - neutrino @xcite inclusive cross sections , as shown in refs .",
    "this model is based on the nuclear response functions .",
    "the quasielastic response is treated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , as illustrated for example in ref .",
    "the multinucleon contribution is deduced from the microscopic evaluation of alberico _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite of the role of two particle - two hole ( 2p-2h ) excitations in the inclusive @xmath42 transverse response .",
    "this calculation includes the correlation term , the two - body meson exchange currents terms , in particular the one associated with delta excitation , and the interference between these quantities .",
    "the single pion production is assumed to arise exclusively from the pionic decay of the delta excitation . in the nucleus",
    "the delta width is modified by medium effects .",
    "they have been introduced and discussed by oset and salcedo in ref .",
    "the non pionic decay of the delta in the medium , which modifies its width leads to 2p-2h or 3p-3h excitations contributing to the multinucleon excitations .",
    "the parameterization of ref .",
    "@xcite for the delta width in the nuclear medium is used in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     let us finally comment on the difference between our results and those presented by the miniboone collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we have mentioned in the introduction .",
    "our method for taking into account multinucleon interactions is an approximate implementation of the correction that one should do to the monte carlo event generator , which would result in a correction of the reconstructed neutrino energy @xmath43 of some events , without any change of the true neutrino energy @xmath17 of the events , which is determined by the neutrino flux . on the other hand , according to ref .",
    "@xcite the miniboone collaboration simulated the effect of the multinucleon interactions `` by reassigning the true neutrino energy of some fraction of events at a given reconstructed neutrino energy to a higher neutrino energy . '' with their procedure , they obtained a worse fit of the low - energy excess , as shown in fig .",
    "36 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and a worse best - fit @xmath41 , given in tab .",
    "ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , in contradiction with our results .",
    "in order to explore if the inclusion of the multinucleon interactions in the analysis of miniboone data decreases the appearance - disappearance tension in the global analyses of the data of short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , we consider the simplest 3 + 1 extension of standard three - neutrino mixing in which there is an additional massive neutrino @xmath27 with mass @xmath28 . in this framework",
    "the effective probability of @xmath44 transitions in short - baseline experiments has the two - neutrino - like form @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath32 is the mixing matrix and @xmath46 .",
    "the electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino appearance and disappearance in short - baseline experiments depend on @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which determine the amplitude @xmath49 of @xmath50 transitions , the amplitude @xmath51 of @xmath52 disappearance , and the amplitude @xmath53 of @xmath54 disappearance .",
    "table  [ tab : chi3p1 ] shows the comparison of the results of the 3 + 1 global fit of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data without are different from those in ref .",
    "@xcite because we improved the treatment of the miniboone background disappearance due to neutrino oscillations according to information kindly given to us by bill louis . ] and with the multinucleon interactions in the analysis of miniboone data .",
    "one can see that in the fit with multinucleon interactions there is a significant improvement of the appearance - disappearance parameter goodness - of - fit , which quantifies the appearance - disappearance tension .",
    "however , this improvement is not sufficient to solve the problem of the appearance - disappearance tension , because the value of the appearance - disappearance parameter goodness - of - fit is still too small .    figure  [ fig:3p1 ] shows the comparison of the allowed regions in the @xmath55@xmath56 plane without and with the multinucleon interactions in the analysis of miniboone data .",
    "one can see that the region allowed by appearance data ( inside the blue curve ) is slightly shifted towards larger values of @xmath56 by taking into account the multinucleon interactions in the analysis of miniboone data .",
    "however , the appearance - disappearance tension persists , since most of the region allowed by appearance data is excluded by the disappearance data ( the region on the right of the red curve ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown that taking into account the multinucleon interactions in the analysis of miniboone data allows a slightly better fit of the miniboone low - energy excess and induces a shift of the allowed region in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane towards smaller values of @xmath0 and larger values of @xmath1 in the framework of two - neutrino oscillations .",
    "we performed also a global fit of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data in the framework of 3 + 1 neutrino mixing .",
    "we have shown that taking into account the multinucleon interactions in the analysis of miniboone data lead to a decrease of the appearance - disappearance tension . however ,",
    "this effect is not enough in order to solve the problem of the appearance - disappearance tension in the global fit of short - baseline neutrino oscillation data , because the value of the appearance - disappearance parameter goodness - of - fit is still too small .",
    "we conclude that further investigations are needed for solving the puzzle of the miniboone low - energy anomaly .",
    "most notably , the microboone experiment at fermilab @xcite will check if the miniboone low - energy anomaly is due to photons produced by neutral - current @xmath3 interactions ( for example @xmath57 production with the detection of only one of the two decay photons ) .",
    "@xmath2-induced events can not be distinguished from photon - induced events in the miniboone mineral - oil cherenkov detector , but they can be distinguished in the microboone liquid argon time projection chamber .",
    "eventually , the sbn experiment at fermilab @xcite will check in a conclusive way the lsnd anomaly and the neutrino oscillation explanation of the miniboone data .",
