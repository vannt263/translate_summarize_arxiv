    "research during recent years has provided the community with significantly increased knowledge on the importance of coherent structures such as vortices , streamers and zonal flows ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the poloidal and toroidal mode numbers respectively ) in determining the overall transport in magnetically confined plasmas .",
    "zonal flows impede transport by shear decorrelation , whereas the geodesic acoustic mode ( gam ) @xcite is the oscillatory counterpart of the zonal flow ( @xmath2 in the potential perturbation , @xmath5 , @xmath6 in the perturbations in density , temperature and parallel velocity ) and thus a weaker effect on turbulence is expected .",
    "nevertheless experimental studies suggest that gams are related to the l - h transition and transport barriers .",
    "the gams are weakly damped by landau resonances and moreover this damping effect is weaker at the edge suggesting that gams are more prominent in the region where transport barriers are expected .",
    "@xcite evidence of interactions between the turbulence driven @xmath7 zonal flow oscillation or geodesic acoustic mode ( gam ) , turbulence and the mean equilibrium flows during this transition was found . furthermore , periodic modulation of flow and turbulence level with the characteristic limit cycle oscillation at the gam frequency was present .",
    "@xcite moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was observed that gams are only somewhat less effective than the residual zonal flow in providing the non - linear saturation .    for heat transport in the electron channel",
    "a likely candidate is the electron temperature gradient ( etg ) mode driven by a combination of electron temperature gradients and field line curvature effects .",
    "@xcite the short scale fluctuations that determines the etg driven heat transport do not influence ion heat transport and is largely unaffected by the large scale flows stabilizing ion - temperature - gradient ( itg ) modes .",
    "the generation of large scale modes such as zonal flows and gams is here realized through the wave kinetic equation ( wke ) analysis that is based on the coupling of the micro - scale turbulence with the gam through the wke under the assumptions that there is a large separation of scales in space and time .",
    "@xcite in non - linear gyrokinetic simulations large thermal transport levels , beyond mixing length estimates have been observed for a long time .",
    "@xcite    in recent work the el - gam , the finite @xmath0-effects were elaborated on , and numerical quantifications of the frequency and growth rate were given in refs .",
    "the finite @xmath0-effects were added in an analogous way compared to the recent work on zonal flows in ref .",
    "in particular , the maxwell stress was included in the generation of the el - gam .",
    "the frequency of the el - gam is higher compared to the ion gam by the square root of the ion - to - electron mass ratio ( @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the real frequencies of the electron and ion gams , respectively . ) .",
    "it was found that similar to the linear growth rate the finite @xmath0 effects were stabilizing the gam using a mode coupling saturation level . furthermore , increasing the non - adiabaticity parameter ( @xmath11 ) decreased the growth rate through a linear contribution .",
    "it is interesting to note that in simulations , damping of the gam due to coupling to higher @xmath3 modes has been found .",
    "@xcite in a careful evaluation of the contributions from higher @xmath3 modes it can be shown that they are , in general , of the order @xmath12 smaller .",
    "however , the effect of higher harmonics is increased by the square of the safety factor ( @xmath13 ) and thus in order to evaluate the effects a more detailed study is called for .    to this end , in this work a detailed investigation of the effects of the higher harmonics on the el - gam driven by electron temperature gradient ( etg ) modes is presented .",
    "we have utilized a two - fluid model for the etg mode based on the braginskii equations with non - adiabatic ions including impurities and finite @xmath0 - effects . @xcite it is shown that the effects of the second harmonics of the density and temperature perturbations on the linear gam frequency and non - linear generation of the gam , found in ref  @xcite can be significant and elevate the frequency of the el - gam similar to what was discovered in ref  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the linear etg mode including the ion impurity dynamics is presented .",
    "the linear el - gam is presented and the non - linear effects are discussed in section iii .",
    "a quantification of the effects of the second harmonics is presented in sec .",
    "iv and the paper is summarized in sec .",
    "we will start be giving the preliminaries of the electron - temperature - gradient mode described by a two - fluid model .",

    "the etg model consists of a combination of ion and electron fluid dynamics coupled through quasineutrality , including finite @xmath0-effects @xcite .",
    "first , we will describe the electron dynamics for the toroidal etg mode governed by the continuity , parallel momentum and energy equations adapted from the braginskii fluid equations .",
    "the electron equations are analogous to the ion fluid equations used for the toroidal itg mode , @xmath22 here we used the definitions @xmath23 as the diamagnetic heat flux , @xmath24 is the @xmath7 drift , @xmath25 is the electron diamagnetic drift velocity , @xmath26 is the electron polarization drift velocity , @xmath27 is the stress tensor drift velocity , and the derivative is defined as @xmath28 .",

    "<S> the effects higher order harmonics have been self - consistently included in the derivation of the electron branch of the electron geodesic acoustic mode ( el - gam ) in an electron - temperature - gradient ( etg ) turbulence background . the work is based on a two - fluid model including finite @xmath0-effects while retaining non - adiabatic ions . in solving the linear dispersion relation , </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the due to the coupling to the @xmath1 mode the real frequency may be significantly altered and yield higher values . </S>"
