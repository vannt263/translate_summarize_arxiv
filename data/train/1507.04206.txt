    "it is well known that theories of thermal evolution of neutron stars have potential to explore properties of superdense matter in neutron star cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently we have suggested a statistical approach ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) to study thermal evolution of middle aged ( @xmath3 yr ) isolated neutron stars ( inss ) and old ( @xmath4 yr ) transiently accreting quasistationary neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( in x - ray transients ; xrts ) .",
    "inss cool down loosing their thermal energy ; neutron stars in xrts are warmed up by deep crustal heating ( @xcite ) during accretion episodes .",
    "thermal evolution of inss and neutron stars in xrts allows one to test the same physics of superdense matter in neutron star cores ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "traditional theories of thermal evolution of these objects are based on calculations of cooling curves for inss ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) , and heating curves for accreting neutron stars ( e.g. , @xmath6 . here , @xmath7 is the redshifted effective surface temperature of the star , @xmath8 is the stellar age , @xmath9 is the redshifted photon surface luminosity of a neutron star in quiescent states of xrt , and @xmath10 is the mass accretion rate in xrt averaged over neutron star cooling time - scales ( about 1 kyr or more ) .    the statistical approach of paper i replaces theoretical cooling / heating curves by probabilities to find neutron stars in certain regions of the @xmath11 or @xmath12 planes .",
    "these probabilities are obtained by averaging individual cooling / heating curves over mass distributions of isolated or accreting neutron stars and over distributions of other neutron star parameters , particularly , of mass of light elements in the heat blanketing envelopes .",
    "light elements increase heat transparency of the heat blanketing envelopes in comparison with standard iron envelopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) and affect thus the thermal evolution of neutron stars . taken an increasing statistics of the sources , calculated probabilities",
    "simplify comparison of the theory with observations .",
    "moreover , these probabilities depend not only on the properties of superdense matter in neutron stars but also on distributions of neutron star parameters ( first of all , on the mass distributions ) which enables one to study these distributions together with the properties of superdense matter ( paper i )",
    ".    full implementation of the statistical approach is a complicated task . in paper",
    "i the idea was illustrated using neutron star models with nucleon cores having one equation of state ( eos ) of superdense matter .",
    "this eos was constructed by @xcite and abbreviated as hhj because it belongs to the family of eoss suggested by @xcite .",
    "a preliminary analysis of paper i indicated that observational data on isolated and accreting neutron stars could be reconciled if powerful direct urca process of neutrino emission @xcite operated in the cores of massive stars and the threshold for the onset of the direct urca process with growing density @xmath13 were broadened ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "otherwise the theory can not explain a number of observed sources .",
    "typical masses of inss need to be lower than the mass @xmath14 at which the direct urca process is on , but accreting neutron stars should be overall more massive to explain at least one source , sax j1808.43658 @xcite , where the direct urca process seems to operate .",
    "this paper extends the analysis of paper i in two ways .",
    "first , we consider two eoss of superdense matter instead of one which illustrates the effects of eoss .",
    "secondly , we take into account that one should distinguish a formal threshold of the direct urca process ( at a density @xmath15 at which the process becomes allowed by momentum conservation of reacting particles for a particular eos ; @xcite ) and the actual threshold @xmath16 which can be shifted with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "the shift can be produced , for instance , by superfluidity of neutron star matter ; superfluidity can suppress the direct urca process and increase @xmath16 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the shift can be produced by strong magnetic fields in neutron stars cores @xcite ; the fields modify momentum conservation rules and can decrease @xmath16 with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "it is also possible that a threshold for enhanced neutrino emission can be broadened and shifted by nuclear physics effects ( as discussed , for instance , by @xcite and in references therein ) .",
    "let us stress that it is the actual threshold @xmath16 which regulates thermal evolution of neutron stars ; this threshold is basically unknown even if we knew the eos .",
    "therefore , we will treat @xmath16 as a free parameter and try to constrain its values .",
    "note that the same effects which shift @xmath16 can broaden the direct urca threshold .",
    "thus , although we consider threshold broadening and shifting as independent phenomena , it may be actually not so .",
    "in addition , it is important to stress that large shifts and strong broadening seem unlikely from theoretical points of view .    as in paper",
    "i , we will treat the broadening of the direct urca threshold on phenomenological level by introducing the same model broadening function characterized by the relative broadening width @xmath0 .",
    "we will not use any specific physical broadening model ( superfluidity , magnetic fields , nuclear physics effects ) but postpone such studies till future , more detailed consideration .",
    "our present analysis will be qualitative but hopefully it will give general understanding of the problem",
    ". the observational basis will be the same as in paper i ( where detailed list of references is given ) .",
    "for convenience of the reader table [ tab : observa ] lists observational sources plotted in the figures below .",
    ".middle - aged cooling inss ( left ) and accreting neutron stars in xrts ( right ) whose thermal surface emission has been detected or constrained ; see paper i for details . [ cols=\"^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : mfun ]          in paper i , we demonstrated the effect of too small broadening , with @xmath18 .",
    "it splits the populations of inss and xrts into families of rather warm and cold sources separated by ` gaps , ' in disagreement with observations ( figs 912 of paper",
    "it was shown for the hhj eos .",
    "now we obtain similar results for the bsk21 eos .",
    "note that at @xmath19 the ` gap ' is narrow and , in principle , could be closed by tuning mass functions . however , to this aim one needs sufficiently sharp and narrow mass distributions which seem unlikely .",
    "therefore , the conclusion that the broadening of the direct urca threshold is not too small looks solid . at @xmath20 the ` gaps ' disappear and the theory can be consistent with the data .      as shown in paper i ( for the hhj eos ) ,",
    "the case of @xmath22 is most suitable to explain the observations .",
    "let us focus on this important case .",
    "for a fixed @xmath22 one should find most appropriate value of @xmath14 and most appropriate mass functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 to explain the data .",
    "[ fig : coold_10_hhj ] shows the probability distributions for inss ( in the @xmath11 plane , left - hand panel ) and xrts ( in the @xmath25 plane , right - hand panel ) assuming the hhj eos , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the mass functions 1i and 1a ( after figs 13 and 14 of paper i ) .",
    "this model explains the observations reasonably well .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ fig : hhj - d - mass ] , we can slightly vary @xmath28 around @xmath29 and slightly adjust the mass functions .",
    "these new explanations will also be satisfactory although the explanation of paper i is one of the best .",
    "the source 15 on the left - hand panel ( xmmu j17323445 , table [ tab : observa ] ; @xcite ) is too hot to be explained by the present model .",
    "as shown in @xcite and paper i , it can be interpreted as a neutron star with strong proton superfluidity in the core and heat blanketing envelope fully made of light elements . the neutron star in pup a ( source 2 ) also seems to require proton superfluidity and the heat blanket of light elements but",
    "the requirement is much less stringent .",
    "we do not include the effects of strong proton superfluidity here to simplify our analysis .        for illustration ,",
    "[ fig : coold_10u_hhj ] presents also the probability distributions for isolated and accreting neutron stars with the hhj eos but using the uniform mass distribution ` 0 ' instead of 1i and 1a .",
    "such a model was not studied in paper i. in contrast to the previous one ( fig .  [ fig : coold_10_hhj ] ) , it predicts the existence of cold inss which have not been observed .",
    "in addition , it is less successful in explaining the existence of many neutron stars in xrts which are intermediate between coldest and hottest ones .",
    "the presented example demonstrates the importance of mass distribution functions @xmath30 in our analysis .",
    "now let us consider the bsk21 eos , whose formal direct urca threshold corresponds to @xmath31 . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : bsk21-d - mass ] , the values @xmath26 and @xmath32 are not most suitable for explaining the observations .",
    "after several trial calculations we have found that the case of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the actual direct urca threshold is shifted to higher densities , is more successful .",

    "[ fig : coold_11_bsk21 ] . the mass distributions 2i and 2a ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mfun ] ) for this case are also modified with respect to 1i and 1a to achieve better agreement with the data .",
    "the modified mass distributions contain slightly less massive isolated and accreting neutron stars .",
    "otherwise , theoretical models presented in figs .  [ fig : coold_10_hhj ] and [ fig : coold_11_bsk21 ] look rather similar .",

    "can be explained by the cooling theory assuming strong proton superfluidity in the neutron star core ( e.g. , @xcite ; paper i ) which we do not include in our current cooling models , for simplicity .",

    "[ fig : coold_10_hhj ] and [ fig : coold_11_bsk21 ] ) .",
    "the critical mass for opening the direct urca process is almost the same as in our best model for the bsk21 eos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coold_11_bsk21 ] ) . however , to explain all the data we now have to take narrower mass distributions 3i and 3a ( fig .",

    "fig : mfun ] ) shifted to lower masses with respect to the previous mass distributions .",
    "this model , although formally possible , seems rather unlikely , because of three reasons .",
    "first , the required mass distributions are too narrow ; secondly , characteristic neutron star masses become uncomfortably low ; thirdly , @xmath14 is much lower than the mass @xmath49 determined by the bsk21 eos .",
    "large differences of @xmath14 from @xmath49 would be difficult to explain from theoretical point of view .",
    "therefore , when we decrease @xmath0 below @xmath50 but keep @xmath51 , we have to narrow neutron star mass distributions ( which does not seem likely ) .",
    "if we , additionally , take lower @xmath14 we increase the difference between @xmath14 and @xmath49 and reduce typical masses of neutron stars ( making our models even less likely ) .",
    "note that the majority of inss should have masses @xmath52 . on the other hand , some neutron stars in xrts should be more massive than @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mfun ] ) .",
    "first of all , this is needed to explain the observations of sax j1804.43658 ( source 13 ; @xcite ) which indicate the operation of direct urca process .      for completeness of our consideration",
    "let us discuss the case of relatively large broadening of the direct urca threshold , @xmath53 .",
    "the general trend is clear . if we broaden the threshold , the direct urca process operates in wider regions of neutron star cores and makes the stars colder",
    "this destroys the agreement of the theory with observations .",
    "formally , it is reflected in the fact ( figs .",
    "[ fig : hhj - d - mass] [ fig : hhj - bsk21-d - mass ] ) that at @xmath53 we obtain @xmath54 . in other words ,",
    "our qualitative analysis of section [ sec : durcamass ] signals that successful solutions of the problem disappear . for instance , as seen from figs 15 and 16 of paper i plotted for the hhj eos at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the theory can not explain the data .",
    "finally , we mention that at @xmath57 three cases are formally possible , ( i ) @xmath58 ; ( ii ) @xmath59 and ( iii ) @xmath60 .",
    "case ( i ) is similar to what is shown in paper i ; theoretical domains of ` warm ' stars ( in successful explanations ) become cooler but domains of ` cold ' stars remain unchanged .",
    "case ( ii ) is the opposite ; ` warmer ' domains remain unchanged but ` colder ' ones become slightly warmer . the last case ( iii ) is a combination of two previous ones ; domains of ` warmer ' stars become cooler and ` colder ' stars warmer .",
    "it is unlikely to reach satisfactory agreement with the observations of inss and xrts in all these cases",
    ". it would also be difficult to explain relatively large broadening of the direct urca threshold from theoretical point of view .",
    "we have extended the statistical approach of paper i to study thermal evolution of middle - aged inss and old accreting quasistationary neutron stars in xrts in two respects .",
    "first , we have considered two eoss in neutron star cores ( the hhj and bsk21 eoss , table [ tab : models ] ) instead of one ( hhj ) eos in paper i. secondly , we have allowed the theoretical density threshold @xmath16 for the direct urca onset to be not only broadened ( as described by the parameter @xmath61 ) but also shifted from its position @xmath17 determined by a given eos . in this way we have actually extended a class of studied eoss because in many cases theoretical eoss give almost the same pressure @xmath62 and neutron star models @xmath63 but have sufficiently different direct urca thresholds @xmath16 ( compare , for instance , the bsk19 , bsk20 , and bsk21 eoss ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have confirmed the principal conclusion of paper i that the theory can explain observations of inss and xrts assuming the onset of direct urca process in sufficiently massive stars with the broadened density threshold .",
    "the main conclusions of the present investigation are as follows .    1 .   at too small ( @xmath18 ) and too high ( @xmath53 ) broadening",
    "a successful explanation of the data is unlikely .",
    "2 .   at intermediate broadening ( @xmath64 ) one can explain the data in a certain interval of critical masses @xmath14 ( @xmath65 ) of stars , where the direct urca sets in , by tuning the mass distributions @xmath23 and @xmath24 of isolated and accreting neutron stars .",
    "the results do not depend significantly on eos ( hhj or bsk21 ) .",
    "the majority of inss should have masses @xmath52 , but some accreting neutron stars should be more massive .",
    "the maximum mass @xmath66 is almost independent of @xmath0 , while the minimum mass @xmath67 decreases linearly with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "most ` successful ' explanations correspond to @xmath1 and @xmath68 , in which case @xmath67 is close to @xmath69 and the mass distributions @xmath23 and @xmath24 resemble distributions 1 and 2 in fig .  [",
    "fig : mfun ] .",
    "5 .   when @xmath0 decreases from ` most successful ' values @xmath22 to the lowest values @xmath19 , the minimum mass @xmath67 decreases and allowable interval of @xmath14 becomes wider whereas the mass distributions @xmath23 and @xmath24 become uncomfortably narrow ( like distributions 3 and 4 in fig .  [ fig : mfun ] ) .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath14 is taken much below @xmath70 , one gets uncomfortably low neutron star masses .",
    "large shifts of @xmath14 from the value @xmath49 , determined by a given eos , and large broadenings @xmath0 of the direct urca threshold , as well as too narrow mass distributions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are unlikely from theoretical point of view ; such formal solutions have to be regarded as less probable . with this in mind ,",
    "the values @xmath1 and @xmath71 seem more probable than the others .",
    "let us stress that our limitations of @xmath14 are not rigorous ( rather a number of indirect evidences ) .",
    "our conclusions have to be regarded as preliminary and can be refined .",
    "first of all , it would be instructive to replace our phenomenological model of shifted and broadened direct urca threshold by some physical models taking into account the effects of superfluidity and/or magnetic fields as well as possible effects of nuclear physics ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , one can try different mass distributions of cooling and accreting neutron stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and formalize the comparison of theoretical and observational probability distributions of isolated and accreting neutron stars using accurate statistical methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) instead of comparison ` by eye '",
    ". it would be good to implement observational selection effects in this analysis ( which seems to be a very complicated problem ) .",
    "these refinements would hopefully clarify the properties of the direct urca process in neutron stars which are closely related to fundamental properties of superdense matter in neutron star cores .",
    "however , such improvements are beyond the scope of this paper .",
