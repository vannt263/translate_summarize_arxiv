    "the optimal copying ( cloning ) of quantum states is an elementary process of central interest in quantum information processing @xcite . as arbitrary quantum states",
    "can not be copied perfectly , the interesting question arises as to which extent a quantum process can perform this task in an optimal way .",
    "recently , much work has been devoted to the copying of pure quantum states @xcite .",
    "these investigations demonstrate that the maximal fidelity which can be achieved in an optimal copying process depends on characteristic properties of the set of states which are to be copied .    motivated by the important role entanglement is playing in the area of quantum information processing in this paper we address the question of copying pure entangled two - qubit states in an optimal way .",
    "though much work has already been devoted to the copying of pure single particle states , first investigations addressing the problem of copying entanglement have been performed only recently @xcite . in this latter work",
    "it was demonstrated that entanglement can not be copied perfectly .",
    "thus , if one can find a quantum operation which perfectly duplicates entanglement of all maximally entangled qubit pairs , it necessarily can not respect separability of the two identical copies produced .",
    "furthermore , for the special case of maximally entangled two - qubit states first copying processes were constructed which maximize the fidelity of each two - qubit copy separately .    in this paper",
    "we address the general problem of copying pure two - qubit states of an arbitrarily given degree of entanglement in an optimal way .",
    "in particular , we are interested in constructing completely positive quantum operations which do not only copy the pure entangled input state but which also guarantee separability of the resulting two - qubit copies in an optimal way .",
    "our motivation for restricting our investigation to two - qubit input states is twofold .",
    "firstly , qubit states still play a dominant role in the area of quantum information processing .",
    "secondly , it is expected that in this simplest case the intricate relationship between entanglement and limits imposed on quantum copying processes by the fundamental laws of quantum theory are exposed in a particularly transparent way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly recapitulate the basic relation between optimal copying processes and corresponding covariant quantum processes which maximize the fidelity of the output states with respect to separable copies . in sec .",
    "iii the most general covariant quantum processes are constructed which are consistent with the linear character of quantum maps and which copy arbitrary pure two - qubit quantum states of a given degree of entanglement . in sec .",
    "iv the additional constraints are investigated which result from the positivity of these quantum maps .",
    "based on these results the parameters of the optimal copying processes are determined . in sec .",
    "v it is shown that these optimal covariant quantum maps can be realized by completely positive deterministic quantum operations .",
    "thus , they may be implemented by an appropriate unitary transformation and a subsequent measurement process involving additional ancilla qubits .",
    "basic physical properties of the resulting optimally copied states are discussed in sec.vi .",
    "in this section basic connections between optimal quantum mechanical copying processes and covariant quantum processes are summarized and specialized to the problem of copying pure bipartite entangled two - qubit states in an optimal way .    in order to put the problem into perspective",
    "let us consider two distinguishable spin-@xmath0 particles ( qubits ) .",
    "their associated four dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 can be decomposed into classes of pure two - qubit states @xmath2 of a given degree of entanglement @xmath3 ( the parameter @xmath3 determines the amount of entanglement in the bipartite system described by states from @xmath4 ) .",
    "these classes are represented by the sets    @xmath5    thereby the parameter @xmath3 ( @xmath6 ) characterizes the degree of entanglement of the pure states in a given class @xmath2 and the kets @xmath7 and @xmath8 constitute an orthonormal basis of the two - dimensional single - qubit hilbert spaces of each of the qubits ( distinguished by the subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "relation ( [ omega ] ) takes into account that local unitary operations of the form @xmath11 are the most general transformations which leave the degree ( measure ) of entanglement @xmath3 of a bipartite quantum state invariant . due to the symmetry relation @xmath12",
    "we can restrict our subsequent discussion to the parameter range @xmath13 . note that in the special case @xmath14 the two - qubit state is separable whereas in the opposite extreme case @xmath15 it is maximally",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that each class @xmath4 contains an orthonormal basis of @xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in constructing quantum processes @xmath16 which copy an arbitrary pure two - qubit state , say @xmath17 , in an optimal way , i.e. @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the density operator of the the input state",
    ". the resulting four - qubit output state is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the appropriately chosen two - qubit quantum state @xmath21 characterizes the initial state of the copying device which is independent of the input state . according to the fundamental laws of quantum theory",
    "the quantum map @xmath16 has to be linear and completely positive @xcite .",
    "the fidelity @xmath22 constitutes a convenient quantitative measure of how close an output state @xmath20 resembles two ideal separable copies of the original input state @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the smallest achievable fidelity , i.e. @xmath23 characterizes the quality of a copying process for a given class of entangled input states @xmath24 .",
    "thus , constructing an optimal copying process is equivalent to maximizing @xmath25 over all possible quantum processes",
    ". let us denote this optimal fidelity by @xmath26 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for any optimal quantum copying process @xmath27 one can always find an equivalent covariant quantum process with the characteristic property @xmath28 & = & { \\cal u } \\rho_{\\rm out } ( \\rho_{in } ) { \\cal u}^{\\dagger } \\label{covariance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 .",
    "thus , this equivalent covariant quantum process yields the same optimal fidelity @xmath30 for all possible two - qubit input states @xmath17 .",
    "thereby , @xmath31 are arbitrary unitary one - qubit transformations . a proof of this theorem is sketched in appendix a. this observation allows us to restrict our further search for optimal copying processes of entangled pure two - qubit states to covariant quantum processes which maximize the fidelity of eq.([fid ] ) .",
    "at this point we want to emphasize that in this work we are concerned with optimal entanglement processes which maximize the fidelity of eq.([fid ] ) .",
    "thus , the covariant copying processes we are looking for are designed for producing output states of the form @xmath32 , i.e. two separable pairs of pure entangled two - qubit states , with the highest possible probability for all possible two - qubit input states @xmath33 . as we are focusing on separable copies of the input states these processes",
    "do not necessarily also maximize the fidelity @xmath34 of the output state with respect to each copy separately , i.e. with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "these latter processes were studied in ref.@xcite , for example , for the special case of maximally entangled pure input states , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "in this section all possible covariant copying processes are constructed which are consistent with the linear character of general quantum maps of the form of eq.([map ] ) .    in view of the covariance condition ( [ covariance ] )",
    "all possible quantum maps of the form ( [ map ] ) can be characterized by the output states @xmath36 which originate from one arbitrarily chosen pure input state , say @xmath37 with @xmath13 . in order to fulfill eq.([covariance ] ) the two - qubit reference state @xmath38 of eq.([map ] ) has to be invariant under arbitrary local unitary transformations of the form @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the initial state of the covariant quantum map is of the form @xcite @xmath39    in order to implement the covariance condition of eq.([covariance ] ) it is convenient to decompose this quantum state into irreducible two - qubit tensor operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite with respect to qubits one and three on the one hand and qubits two and four on the other hand . performing an arbitrary unitary transformation of the form @xmath42 with @xmath43 , for example",
    ", a product of such tensor operators transforms according to    @xmath44    with @xmath45 .",
    "thereby , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) denote the relevant rotation operators and @xmath48 are their associated rotation matrices @xcite .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath49 denote the total angular momenta of the relevant two - qubit quantum states and the parameters @xmath50 indicate the irreducible subspaces of the relevant representations . for the sake of convenience",
    "some basic relations of these irreducible two - qubit tensor operators are summarized in appendix b. it is apparent from eq.([irred ] ) that an arbitrary unitary transformation of the form @xmath51 with @xmath43 mixes the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 within each irreducible representation separately . in terms of these irreducible tensor operators an arbitrary initial state @xmath54 of the form of eq.([inputdm ] ) can be decomposed according to ( compare with eq.([decompose ] ) )    @xmath55    with the expansion coefficients    @xmath56    thereby , @xmath57 denotes the trace over the four - qubit hilbert space of the system- and device qubits . in view of the basic transformation property of eq.([irred ] ) the most general output state resulting from a linear and covariant quantum map",
    "is given by    @xmath58    according to the fundamental laws of quantum theory the unknown coefficients @xmath59 are necessarily restricted by the fact that @xmath20 has to be a non - negative operator . in particular , being a hermitian operator the output state @xmath20 has to fulfill the relations @xmath60 further restrictions on these unknown coefficients are obtained from the explicit form of the input state @xmath54 , i.e.    @xmath61    with @xmath62 .",
    "thus , according to eq.([input ] ) the most general output state of eq.([output1 ] ) generally depends on 17 coefficients , namely @xmath63 these parameters determine all linear covariant quantum processes with a hermitian output state @xmath36 provided the coefficients @xmath64 are real - valued .",
    "the explicit form of the output state @xmath36 is given in appendix c ( compare with eq.([matrix ] ) ) .",
    "proper normalization of the output state requires @xmath65 which implies @xmath66",
    "in this section the special covariant quantum processes are determined which copy pure entangled two - qubit states of a given degree of entanglement @xmath3 with the highest possible fidelity .    for this purpose",
    "we start from the most general output state which is consistent with the linear and covariant character of the copying process as determined by eqs.([output1 ] ) , ( [ hermit ] ) , ( [ trace ] ) and by an arbitrary combination of the possible non - zero parameters @xmath67 of ( [ parameters ] ) .",
    "the non - negativity of this output state on the one hand and the optimization of its fidelity on the other hand impose further restrictions on these parameters .",
    "the non - negativity of the output state implies that the inequality @xmath68 has to be fulfilled for arbitrary pure four - qubit states @xmath69 .",
    "as outlined in appendix c this condition gives rise to the set of inequalities @xmath70 and @xmath71 in particular , in the special case @xmath72 the last inequality of ( [ pos2 ] ) implies @xmath73    the fidelity @xmath74 of the output state @xmath36 of eq.([output1 ] ) with respect to the ideal pure two - qubit output state @xmath75 with @xmath76 is given by    @xmath77    besides the parameter @xmath3 determining the degree of entanglement of the input state @xmath78 this fidelity depends on the six parameters @xmath79 .",
    "an upper bound of this fidelity can be derived with the help of the inequalities ( [ pos2 ] ) , ( [ pos3 ] ) and with the relation @xmath80 which is obtained from the normalization condition ( [ trace ] ) , i.e.    @xmath81    this upper bound is attained provided the conditions @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are fulfilled . maximizing the right hand side of eq.([omezeni_fidelity ] ) with respect to the single parameter @xmath85 we finally arrive at the inequality @xmath86 with @xmath87 this upper bound of relation ( [ upper ] ) is reached provided the parameters of the covariant copying process fulfill the relations @xmath88 consistent with the inequalities ( [ pos1 ] ) , ( [ pos2 ] ) and with eq.([state ] ) the remaining parameters of the covariant copying process which do not explicitly determine the fidelity must be chosen in the following way @xmath89 with the help of eq.([state ] ) it is straightforward to check that for these parameters the output state @xmath36 is a non - negative operator .",
    "thus , consistent with the fundamental laws of quantum theory the output state of a covariant quantum process which copies all pure two - qubit states of the same degree of entanglement @xmath3 with the maximal fidelity @xmath90 is given by eq.([output1 ] ) with the parameters ( [ parameters ] ) being determined by eqs.([first ] ) and ( [ rest ] ) ( compare also with eq.([state ] ) ) .",
    "the fidelity @xmath90 of this optimal covariant copying process and its dependence on the degree of entanglement @xmath3 of the pure two - qubit input state is depicted in fig.[fidelity1 ] .     of a pure two - qubit input state .",
    "the fidelity varies between @xmath91 and @xmath92 . ]",
    "this fidelity oscillates between a minimum value of @xmath93 which is assumed at @xmath94 and a maximum value of @xmath95 which is assumed at @xmath15 .",
    "the value @xmath14 corresponds to the optimal copying of two arbitrary ( generally different ) separable qubit states .",
    "consistent with known results on optimal cloning of arbitrary single qubit states in this latter case the fidelity @xmath90 assumes the value @xmath96 . from fig.[fidelity1 ] it is also apparent for which degrees of entanglement @xmath3 it is easier to copy entangled states than separable ones .    at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning major differences between our results and the previously published results on the copying of maximally entangled states of ref .",
    "@xcite . in our treatment",
    "we are interested in obtaining two separable copies , say @xmath97 , of entangled two - qubit states @xmath17 of a given degree of entanglement . correspondingly , we are optimizing the two - pair fidelity @xmath98 , for @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , in ref.@xcite the optimization of the single - pair fidelities @xmath99 and @xmath100 was investigated for the special case of maximally entangled input states , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "thus , this latter process does not simultaneously also optimize the separability of the copies .",
    "for maximally entangled input states our optimized process yields for these latter figure of merits , for example , the values @xmath101 which is below the optimal value of @xmath102 presented in ref .",
    "but , for the same value of @xmath103 the figure of merit of eq.([optimalfid ] ) yields for our optimal copying process the values @xmath104 whereas the copying process of ref .",
    "@xcite yields the smaller value of @xmath105 because this latter process does not optimize with respect to two separable copies .",
    "in this section it is demonstrated that the covariant optimal copying processes derived in sec .",
    "iv are completely positive deterministic quantum operations . thus , they can be implemented by unitary quantum transformations with the help of additional ancilla qubits .    using eqs.([output1 ] ) , ( [ first ] ) , ( [ rest ] ) it is straightforward to demonstrate that the output state of the optimal covariant quantum copying process can be written in the form    @xmath106    with the operators @xmath107 thereby , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are projection operators onto the triplet and singlet subspaces of qubits @xmath110 and @xmath111 and @xmath112 denote the corresponding ( pure ) two - qubit quantum states with total angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath113 and magnetic quantum numbers @xmath114 .",
    "the states @xmath115 and @xmath116 denote orthonormal basis states in the one - qubit hilbert spaces of qubits three and four , respectively . according to eqs.([out ] ) and ( [ kraus1 ] ) the four kraus operators @xcite @xmath117 ( @xmath118 characterize a quantum operation which acts on the two input qubits one and two and which depends on their degree of entanglement @xmath3 . these kraus operators map two - qubit states into four - qubit states and they fulfill the completeness relation @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the unit operator in the hilbert space of qubits one and two .",
    "thus , eq.([out ] ) describes a deterministic quantum operation @xcite acting on the two input - qubits which are to be copied in an optimal way .",
    "in addition , the kraus representation of eq.([out ] ) demonstrates that the optimal covariant copying processes considered so far are completely positive quantum maps @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the quantum operation of eq.([out ] ) may also be implemented by an associated unitary transformation @xmath121 which involves two additional ancilla - qubits . denoting orthonormal basis states of these additional ancilla - qubits by @xmath122 this unitary transformation @xmath121",
    "can be choosen so that it fulfills the relation    @xmath123 .",
    "thereby , the subscripts of the state vectors label the qubits they are referring to and the bracket of eq.([help1 ] ) indicates that the kraus operators act on the system- and device - qubits only . due to the completeness relation ( [ complete ] ) the linear transformation of eq.([help1 ] ) preserves scalar products , i.e. @xmath124 .",
    "thus , it can be completed to a unitary transformation acting on the six - qubits constituted by the system , the device- , and the two ancilla - qubits @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the optimal covariant copying process of eq.([out ] ) can be realized also with the help of this unitary transformation @xmath125 in the following way : in a first step one applies the transformation @xmath125 to the intial state @xmath126    in a second step one measures the ancilla - qubits in the orthogonal basis @xmath122 without selection of the measurement results .",
    "this non - selective measurement @xcite yields the output state @xmath127 of eq.([out ] ) .",
    "in this section the degree of entanglement and statistical correlations of the output states produced by the optimal covariant copying processes are discussed .",
    "as the process of copying of an arbitrary pure entangled two - qubit state is not perfect the original and the copy will exhibit characteristic entanglement features and statistical correlations .",
    "convenient measures for quantifying these properties are the concurrences @xcite and the indices of correlation @xcite of the subsystems .",
    "let us consider a two - qubit state described by a density operator @xmath128 .",
    "its concurrence is defined in terms of the decreasing set of eigenvalues , say @xmath129 , of the operator @xmath130 thereby , @xmath131 denotes the pauli spin operator and the star - symbol @xmath132 denotes complex conjugation . in terms of these eigenvalues the concurrence of the quantum state @xmath128 is defined by the relation @xcite @xmath133 according to this definition the values of the concurrence are confined to the interval @xmath134 $ ] with @xmath135 and @xmath136 corresponding to a separable and a maximally entangled two - qubit state .",
    "a convenient measure for quantifying bipartite statistical correlations of a quantum state @xmath128 is its index of correlation @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the relation @xmath138 with @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 denoting the von neumann - entropies of subsystems @xmath110 , @xmath111 and of the whole system .",
    "the corresponding reduced density operators of the subsystems are denoted by @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "correspondingly , the index of correlation @xmath144 vanishes for all uncorrelated ( factorizable ) states and it attains its largest value for maximally entangled pure states ( with @xmath145 ) . let us now investigate entanglement and statistical correlations of the output state @xmath36 with respect to the first and the second qubit , with respect to the first and third qubit and with respect to qubits one and two on the one hand and qubits three and four on the other hand .",
    "thereby , the basis states @xmath191 involve eigenstates of the total angular momenta of qubits one and three on the one hand and qubits two and four on the other hand , i.e. @xmath192 with @xmath193 and @xmath194 denoting the relevant total angular momentum and magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "the non - negativity of the output state ( [ state ] ) necessarily implies that all diagonal matrix elements have to be non - negative .",
    "the resulting constraints give rise to the inequalities ( [ pos1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for appropriately chosen pure states @xmath195 the relation @xmath196 yields the inequalities ( [ pos2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath197 with @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath198 denoting arbitrary complex - valued coefficients .      w. k. wooters and w. h. zurek , nature ( london ) * 299 * , 802 ( 1982 ) .",
