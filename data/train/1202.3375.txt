    "interaction effects are expected to be important for the physics of bilayer graphene and may cause a formation of correlated many - body phases.@xcite this needs to be contrasted to intrinsic monolayer graphene in which a vanishing density of states at the dirac points suppresses the influence of electronic correlations.@xcite recent experiments on suspended bilayer graphene , @xcite which is free of substrate effects , reveal a gapped state at and around the charge neutrality point .",
    "the state may be of topological origin@xcite due to the observed@xcite conductance of the order of @xmath5 and may exhibit an anomalous quantum hall effect , i.e. a quantum hall effect at zero magnetic field . in the most recent experiment on high mobility samples from ref .  , a completely insulating behavior was found .    from the theory point of view , several proposals were given @xcite for the existence of gapped ( and gapless ) phases at the charge neutrality point , including those that break the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "most of them are based on the particle - hole ( excitonic ) binding which is the most natural assumption in the understanding of a gapped phase at the charge neutrality point .",
    "these theories assume a quadratic dispersion of the electrons in the low - energy effective description @xcite , and direct hopping between two sublattices in different layers that leads to the linear dispersion (  triagonal warping \" ) is neglected .",
    "this assumption is justified if the chemical potential is not exactly situated at the charge - neutrality point .    to explore additional possibilities for gapped phases in the presence of a finite chemical potential , we discuss here superconducting instabilities , especially with an eye on the possibility of topological ( fully gapped ) superconductivity on the honeycomb bilayer .",
    "bilayer graphene may be potentially also viewed as a strongly - correlated system with a possibility to support a layered antiferromagnetic state,@xcite similar to the mott physics of high @xmath6 superconductors .",
    "the existence of a layered antiferromagnetic state is supported by the most recent experiment with high quality samples , @xcite which feature completely insulating behavior at the charge neutrality point .",
    "there is , so far , no systematic study of superconducting instabilities in the presence of electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions on the honeycomb bilayer at finite doping ( see , however , ref .   for fermions in the presence of weak electron - electron interactions only at zero chemical potential ) . to address this question , we study in the present paper a microscopic model of a single effective honeycomb monolayer with reduced nearest neighbor hopping and third - neighbor hopping , in addition to inter - site attractive interactions .",
    "the kinetic term of the effective model is obtained by integrating out the `` high - energy '' degrees of freedom from the direct interlayer hopping ( i.e. assuming strong interlayer hopping in the honeycomb bilayer ) , and the inter - site superexchange interaction originates from the hubbard on - site repulsion .",
    "this model is to a certain degree biased to antiferromagnetism and @xmath7-wave superconductivity , but preserves the usual low - energy description of the bilayer graphene.@xcite moreover , in contrast to the usual low - energy model of bilayer graphene , the present model accounts for the lattice symmetry of the original model ( the honeycomb bilayer ) that may be relevant for the symmetry of the superconducting order parameters .",

    "near 3/8 and 5/8 filling of the @xmath9-bands , i.e.  near the van - hove singularity in the density of states , the cooper pairing becomes much stronger .",
    "our conclusion is that the @xmath2 superconducting instability is the leading superconducting instability of the honeycomb bilayer with strong interlayer hopping at finite doping and the same instability may be present in the bilayer graphene at finite doping . however , due to the presumed smallness of coupling constant and order parameter , as well as strong quantum fluctuations in two dimensions , it may be difficult to detect this order experimentally in today s graphene samples .",

    "we discussed the possibility of a superconducting instability in this framework and concluded that @xmath2 is the leading superconducting instability in the case of the graphene bilayer at moderate dopings and low energy scales .",
    "we would like to point out also to the difference between monolayer and bilayer case that follows form the symmetry analysis of the simple model with attractive interactions and ensuing short range order parameter on both lattices . in the effective description around @xmath169 points @xmath83-wave and @xmath92-wave",
    "are found @xcite in the monolayer case , and @xmath92-wave and @xmath7-wave in the bilayer case .",
    "the bilayer honeycomb lattice appears at moderate dopings as yet another stage on which time reversal symmetry breaking @xmath7-wave superconductivity may appear ( see @xcite for moderately doped monolayer ) and may be driven by similar physics as in the case of predicted instabilities at special ( very high ) dopings of honeycomb monolayer @xcite . in the case we presented",
    "the canonical @xcite low momentum description , @xmath168 , holds due to the quadratically dispersing dirac electrons .",

    "here , we present briefly the weak - coupling analysis of superconducting order in the effective bilayer model . in order to simplify the notation , we use the letter @xmath19 to denote the effective hopping @xmath162 .",
    "the dos at the fermi level , @xmath148 , is on the order of the inverse hopping parameter @xmath170 .",
    "notice that , if only a parabolic band is taken into account it remains fixed at its @xmath171 value , but corrections to the parabolic approximation immediately yield a contribution that varies linearly with the fermi level , in agreement with the dos plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:02](b ) .    in the case when @xmath172 , a weak - coupling bcs analysis that takes into account only electrons in the lower bogoliubov band gives @xmath173 with @xmath174 as an energy cut - off around the fermi value , for the solution , and @xmath175 for the gain in the mean - field energy , @xmath176 , by the pairing instability .",
    "the weak coupling bcs analysis in the case of electron doping @xmath177 for @xmath178 and @xmath179 gives @xmath180 for the solution which we denoted by @xmath181 , and @xmath182 in the case of @xmath84 wave .",
    "for the energy gain one obtains @xmath183 and for a @xmath184 wave , one finds @xmath185 because of its twice lower mean - field energy , the @xmath186 time - reversal symmetry breaking instability , which we call in short @xmath7-wave , is more likely than @xmath0 and @xmath84-wave order parameters . in the large - doping limit",
    ", the energy minimization is also much more efficient for @xmath7-wave than @xmath94-wave as seen in the small value of the ratio @xmath187,\\ ] ] for @xmath188 .",
    "the most natural choice for @xmath174 is to be of the order of @xmath21 as a first energy scale when we start from the smallest one , i.e. @xmath96 . the time - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath7-wave solution of our bcs mean - field hamiltonian is also expected from a theorem proved in ref . .",
    "the theorem was derived for 2d one - band models that reveal both time - reversal symmetry and a point symmetry described by the dihedral group @xmath189 [ or the o(2 ) rotation symmetry in the case of continuum models ] .",
    "it states that generally a time - reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state has a lower free energy than time - reversal symmetric ones if one is confronted with a 2d representation of the symmetry group . in the case of weak coupling",
    "that we consider here , i.e. @xmath190 , and @xmath191 ( electron doping ) , we have an effective one - band theory of electrons to which the theorem can be applied .",
    "also the dispersion of the complex @xmath7-wave order parameter is more complicated in our case ( than in ref . ) as can be seen in eqs.([valuesc ] ) and ( [ a ] ) .",
    "but in the weak coupling limit the @xmath192 term can be neglected in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) , and we obtain expressions that are reminiscent to those of ref . .",
    "in the following we investigate more closely an effective low - energy description of the @xmath7-wave instability , in the case of high electron doping , and discuss only the lower energy bogoliubov band . therefore our effective hamiltonian is @xmath193 where @xmath194 . in the weak - coupling bcs analysis",
    "it can be easily shown that the hamiltonian is completely equivalent to the one with @xmath195 , because both hamiltonians have an effective description on a fermi circle defined by @xmath196 . with this adjustment",
    "we have exactly the form of the bcs hamiltonian studied in ref . on time - reversal symmetry breaking superconductors in two dimensions . in the so - called weak - pairing case for finite @xmath191 that we want to study , the minimum of bogoliubov excitations moves to finite values of @xmath42 , @xmath197 , i.e. to the fermi surface of free particles .",
    "the cooper pair wave function @xmath198 may be a non - universal function of @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the relative coordinate of the pair .",
    "on the other hand , the dependence of the function on the angle of vector @xmath200 is fixed and can easily be derived in the bogoliubov formalism to be @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the two - dimensional complex coordinate .",
    "thus the relative angular momentum of the cooper pair is @xmath203 .",
    "the weak - pairing phase is topological , gapped in the bulk because @xmath191 , and possesses a doublet of spin 1/2 dirac edge modes @xcite . in our case , because of the fermion doubling on the honeycomb lattice and the existence of the two @xmath169 points ( valleys ) [ and because around each one we have the same effective description given by hamiltonian in eq.([ham ] ) ] , we expect four dirac modes on the edge .",
    "in the weak coupling limit at @xmath204 , when both bogoliubov bands are taken into account we find for @xmath0 symmetry @xmath205 with @xmath206 , for the solution , and @xmath207 for the energy gain .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath2 symmetry we find @xmath208 and @xmath209 because @xmath210 any real combination of @xmath0 and @xmath84 waves is more likely than @xmath2 wave .",
