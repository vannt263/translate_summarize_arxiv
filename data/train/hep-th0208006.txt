    "this paper addresses the problem of a manifestly invariant renormalization procedure for supersymmetric ( susy ) gauge theories .",
    "a peculiar feature of supersymmetric gauge theories is nonpolynomial structure of the action .",
    "the only possibility to reduce the action to a polynomial form is to use the wess - zumino gauge .",
    "however in this case the manifest supersymmetry is lost and the powerful superdiagram technique can not be used .    in supersymmetric gauges an infinite number of primitively divergent diagrams is present , which makes the theory formally nonrenormalizable .",
    "nevertheless it can be shown that supersymmetry and gauge invariance reduce the number of independent counterterms , and the usual charge and wave functions renormalizations are sufficient .",
    "the corresponding procedure was firstly constructed for susy qed by one of the present authors @xcite and then applied to abelian and non - abelian models in papers @xcite .",
    "however the proof given in these papers relies on the assumption of a possibility to use an intermediate regularization preserving the symmetry of the theory .",
    "most popular gauge invariant regularizations like dimensional regularization @xcite , dimensional reduction @xcite or lattice regularizations break supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "higher covariant derivative regularization @xcite in principle may be used , but the calculations are quite involved ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "a possible alternative is presented by algebraic renormalization . in this method",
    "one uses an arbitrary regularization or subtraction scheme , breaking the symmetry of the theory ( for example the momentum cut - off regularization or the differential renormalization @xcite ) .",
    "the symmetry is restored at the second step by tuning finite counterterms to provide relevant generalized ward identities ( gwi ) for the renormalized green functions .",
    "this method was applied successfully to susy gauge theories in the papers @xcite , where the invariant renormalizability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 non - abelian susy gauge models was proven in the framework of algebraic renormalization .",
    "however a practical implementation of the algebraic renormalization is rather cumbersome as the procedure requires a tuning of a large number of ( noninvariant ) counterterms .",
    "recently a new method of invariant renormalization was proposed @xcite , which provides automatically the renormalized green functions possessing a relevant symmetry for arbitrary intermediate regularization .",
    "this method was formulated as a special subtraction procedure which incorporates gwi .",
    "solving explicitly the corresponding gwi one reduces the problem of renormalization in an arbitrary regularization scheme to explicitly gauge invariant procedure .",
    "so instead of the two step algebraic renormalization we have the one step procedure which guarantees the symmetry of the renormalized theory .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss how this method may be generalized to supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "renormalization of susy qed is described in details .",
    "a corresponding procedure for non - abelian susy gauge models is under consideration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section [ section_susy_qed ] we introduce the notations and remind some information about supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics .",

    "this invariance allows to gauge away some components of @xmath15 , resulting in the following equation :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a gauge field , @xmath18 is a maiorana spinor and @xmath8 is a real scalar auxiliary field . in this gauge ,",
    "which is called wess - zumino gauge , residual gauge transformations depend only on a single parameter , while the action is polynomial .",
