    "furthermore , @xmath20    roughly speaking , this theorem states that if the edge density if smaller than @xmath21 , then the quasi - star is the extremal example , while for higher edge densities the quasi - clique becomes extremal .",

    "so we can assume that @xmath102 takes only 0 and 1 values in @xmath209 and @xmath210 . to show that noninteger values are not possible in the other places , we need a technical lemma .",
