    "nuclear activity is an important phase in the evolution of galaxies .",

    "the infalling material builds up a fast rotating accretion disc , which heats up viscously .",
    "the emerging uv / optical radiation illuminates a gas and dust reservoir ",
    "the so - called _ molecular torus_. given the high opacity of the dust in this wavelength range , the torus morphology is able to geometrically unify two observed classes of active galaxies : type1 objects , where the torus is viewed face - on ( and all of the characteristics of the central region are visible ) and type2 objects ( torus viewed edge - on ) , where most of the light from the accretion disc is absorbed and reemitted in the infrared regime .",
    "this is the essence of the _ unified scheme of active galactic nuclei_. despite its general success when probed with observational data , the nature of the obscuring gas and dust reservoir  the torus , as well as the triggering mechanism of such phases are still a matter of active research . to assess the final stages of mass transport through the central tens of parsec region , nearby objects are needed , due to the limitations on resolution posed by currently available instruments .",
    "therefore , seyfert galaxies are an ideal testbed to study these processes .",
    "midi ( mid - infrared interferometer ) observations recently resolved the innermost parts of the torus directly for the first time ( e.  g.  @xcite ) and found evidence for a clumpy dust distribution . in these proceedings , we numerically model a scenario , which is able to describe the build - up and evolution of a nuclear gas disc or torus .",

    "after approximately 50myrs following the starburst , the mass loss of the newly born stellar population is dominated by slow winds and the ejection of planetary nebulae respectively .",

    "larger values of @xmath31 clearly lead to a larger mass accretion rate and at the current age of the nuclear stellar cluster , the derived values agree well with typical accretion rates of seyfert galaxies of a few times @xmath32 to @xmath33yr ( @xcite )",
    ". however , ngc1068 seems to be in a heavily accreting state , which can be accomodated in our model only , when assuming e.g.clumpy accretion .",
    "in these proceedings , we show that evolving stars from a massive and young nuclear star cluster , as found in nearby seyfert galaxies provide enough gas to assemble a parsec - sized nuclear gas disc . to this end",

    ", we derive input parameters of our simulations from observations of the nearby and well - studied seyfert2 galaxy ngc1068 .",
    "this two - stage analysis enables us to ( i ) do a long term evolution study , ( ii ) link the tens of parsec scale region of galactic nuclei ( observed with the sinfoni instrument ) to the sub - parsec scales ( probed by midi and in water maser emission ) and ( iii ) test our model directly with a large number of observational results . at the current age of its nuclear starburst of 250myr , our simulations yield disc sizes of the order of 0.8 to 0.9pc , gas masses of @xmath0 and mass transfer rates of @xmath34 through the inner rim of the disc in good comparison with observed disc and torus properties .",
    "on basis of these comparisons , we conclude that the proposed scenario seems to be a reasonable model and shows that nuclear star formation activity and subsequent agn activity are intimately related .            ,",
