    "the darklight detector is a compact , magnetic spectrometer designed to search for decays to lepton pairs of a heavy photon @xmath0  in the mass range @xmath1 at coupling strengths of @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : darklight1 ] [ left ] ) . the process @xmath5",
    "will be used to search for a resonance in @xmath6 .",
    "the reach of the experiment in the ( @xmath7 , @xmath6 ) parameter space complements that of other existing or proposed heavy photon search experiments .",
    "motivation for searching for an @xmath0  in this mass range is discussed in detail elsewhere ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , section 6.2.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we note that this region is particularly interesting since it includes much of the preferred region for the @xmath8 anomaly .",
    "the reach can be extended in @xmath7 via inclusion of @xmath2invisible decays by adding photon detection capability .",
    "darklight will be able to make other measurements as well , such as a measurement of the proton charge radius .",
    "the experiment reconstructs the 4-vectors of all visible final - state particles ; for an @xmath9 decaying to @xmath10 , one can use the reconstructed invariant mass spectrum of electron / positron pairs to search for the narrow ( @xmath11 ) @xmath9 mass peak , while the 4-vectors of the remaining particles provide checks on the kinematics and background suppression .",
    "the key to detection is adequate control of the irreducible qed background , which requires excellent momentum resolution for the leptons and excellent energy resolution for the proton .",
    "darklight is designed for operation at the 100 mev jlab free electron laser ( fel ) facility .",
    "the fel electron beam will be directed onto a windowless , dense ( @xmath12 hydrogen gas target located in a 0.5 t solenoidal magnetic field ( see fig .  [ fig : darklight1 ] [ right ] ) . surrounding the target",
    "are two double - layer , central and forward silicon detectors for detection of the recoil proton and for lepton tracking .",
    "these are located inside the beampipe and cover the polar angular range @xmath13 . outside the beampipe is a lepton tracker covering angles @xmath14 .",
    "a lead scintillator sandwich for photon detection surrounds the tracker .",
    "other components include a tungsten collimator inside the beampipe to remove elastically scattered , high-@xmath15 electrons , a mller dump , and a lead shield to prevent backscattered radiation originating in the mller dump from entering the tracker .",
    "all components except the dump are located inside the magnet and iron yoke .",
    "darklight is expected to be installed on the uv beamline at the jlab fel at location a1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : darklight2 ] .",
    "the fel provides a beam power of up to 1  mw ( 10 ma current ) . using the dense hydrogen target described above",
    ", it will provide 1  ab@xmath16 of integrated luminosity per month of operation .",
    "a series of beam tests in summer 2012 verified that sustained , high - power transmission of the fel beam through millimiter - size apertures is feasible  @xcite .",
    "these tests culminated in a 7-hour - long run with a 430  kw beam directed through a 2  mm diameter , 127  mm long aperture in an aluminum block where beam losses of less than 3  ppm from halo interception and wakefield effects were achieved  @xcite .",
    "radiation backgrounds were measured and found to be acceptable and in agreement with fluka and mcnp simulations  @xcite .",
    "numerous lessons were learned about the sustained operation of the fel at megawatt power levels  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the reach of the experiment can be extended by including @xmath2invisible decays through adding photon detection capability . the reach for the invisible search for various photon detection efficiencies",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dlreachd1 ] .",
    "the efficiency refers only to the detection efficiency _ within _ the detector volume ; photons which escape the lepton tracking region are not detected .",
    "we see that with 95% photon detection efficiency , we can probe the majority of the preferred region . with no photon detection , the invisible search does not even extend to a region of parameter space which is not already excluded by anomalous magnetic moment data . even with 50% photon efficiency , we can barely probe the preferred region , thus showing the importance of efficient photon detection . because photons are primarily produced collinear with charged particles , a significant fraction of photons will escape down the beamline undetected , limiting the reach in the low invariant mass region .     could explain the @xmath17 discrepancy .",
    "@xmath18 refers to a kinematic cut designed to mitigate mis - measurement of the reconstructed @xmath19 invariant mass .",
    "the beam dump constraints from the visible search are absent here because they do not apply to invisibly decaying particles . ]      extending this capability to the darklight detector concept could be accomplished by adding a lead(pb)-scintillator sandwich in a cylindrical configuration outside the lepton tracker with approximate dimensions of 60  cm ( diameter ) x 150  cm ( length ) .",
    "the design concept borrows from experience gained with neutrino experiments , including minerva and minos . for photons of energy",
    "10100 mev the cross - section in pb is around 20 barns .",
    "this is below the critical energy , so this would correspond to a single electron with corresponding energy of @xmath20 or detection . with the density of pb being 11.3 g/@xmath21 and n = 200 g / mole , this gives a corresponding wavelength @xmath22 = 0.7  cm .",
    "therefore , with lead and scintillator bars of thickness 0.5  cm and 1  cm , respectively , the intrinsic probability per layer would be about 0.53 .",
    "so for 3  layers the probability of detecting these photons would be approximately 90% . simulating @xmath23 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dlieffics ] .",
    "studies are underway to optimize the efficiency via prototyping .",
    "optimal read - out setup and energy loss calculations are in progress .",
    "a proposal was submitted to jlab pac37 in jan .",
    "2011 requesting conditional approval to allow us to carry out beam tests at the fel to ensure our target was compatible with the fel beam and carry out beam halo measurements .",
    "conditional approval was granted and jlab allocated funds for the beam test , which was successfully completed in july 2012 .",
    "a final proposal requesting full approval from the laboratory was prepared for jlab pac39  @xcite which met in june 2012 .",
    "approval of darklight was granted by jlab in june 2013 , and the experiment is moving on to a full technical design .",
    "the goal is to commission the detector in 2015 with data - taking in 2016 .",
