    "experimental creation of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has led to emergence of a new field of nonlinear wave dynamics owing to a remarkable richness of nonlinear wave patterns supported by this medium .",
    "first , vortices and bright and dark solitons were observed and their dynamics was studied theoretically in framework of the mean - field approach ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "then , dispersive shocks generated by a large and sharp disturbance of bec were found in experiment @xcite and explained theoretically @xcite in framework of the whitham theory of modulations of nonlinear waves ( see also numerical experiment in @xcite ) . at last ,",
    "the stationary waves generated by supersonic flow of bec past obstacles have been recently observed @xcite .",
    "they were studied in @xcite where the main focus was on the nonlinear component representing a train of solitons ( in the simplest case of a single soliton @xcite ) or , more precisely , having a form of a modulated nonlinear periodic wave .",
    "the theory developed in @xcite shows that there exist stationary spatial solutions of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation which describe nonlinear waves supported by a supersonic bec flow with mach number @xmath0 where @xmath1 is velocity of the oncoming flow at @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the sound speed of the long - wavelength linear waves .",
    "the density @xmath4 of the condensate , as well as the components of the velocity field , depend on the variable @xmath5 alone , where @xmath6 is the slope of the phase lines with respect to the @xmath7 axis and it is supposed that the velocity of the oncoming flow is directed along the @xmath8 axis . then , the mach cone for sound waves with infinitely large wavelength corresponds to the slope @xmath9 and it was shown in @xcite that the spatial ( oblique ) solitons have @xmath10 , that is they are located inside the mach cone . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the shallow solitons are formed close to the mach cone , @xmath11 , and they are asymptotically described by the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation ; and deep solitons have @xmath12 ( i.e. they are formed at small angles with respect to direction of the oncoming flow ) and are asymptotically described by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . on the contrary ,",
    "the linear waves are generated outside the mach cone and they have @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , these linear waves had been observed in numerical simulations some years ago @xcite but the theory of their generation has not been developed so far .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop such a theory .",
    "our analysis is based on the use of the mean - filed description of bec dynamics in the framework of the gp equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the order parameter ( `` condensate wave function '' ) , @xmath16 is the potential which confines atoms of a bose gas in a trap and/or describes interaction of the bec with the obstacle , and @xmath17 is an effective coupling constant arising due to inter - atomic collisions with the @xmath18-wave scattering length @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath21 being the atomic mass .",
    "here we consider the bose - einstein condensate with repulsive interaction between particles for which @xmath22 .",
    "as suggested by the experimental set - up @xcite , we consider a two - dimensional flow of a condensate , so that the condensate wave function @xmath23 depends on only two spatial coordinates , @xmath24 .",
    "to simplify the theory , we assume that the characteristic size of the obstacle is much less than its distance from the center of the trap , so that the oncoming flow can be considered as uniform with constant density @xmath25 of atoms and constant velocity @xmath26 directed parallel to @xmath8 axis ( see also estimates in @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to transform eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 2 ] ) to a `` hydrodynamic '' form by means of the substitution @xmath27 where @xmath28 is density of atoms in bec and @xmath29 denotes its velocity field , and to introduce dimensionless variables @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the bec healing length and numerical constants are introduced for future convenience . as a result of this transformation",
    "we obtain the system ( we omit tildes for convenience of the notation ) @xmath32=0 ,     \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",
    "since we shall consider waves far enough from the obstacle , the potential is omitted in ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in linear waves propagating on the background flow with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "hence , we introduce @xmath37 and linearize the system ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) with respect to small deviations @xmath38 . as a result",
    "we obtain the system @xmath39 which describes propagation of linear waves in bec with a uniform flow .",
    "we obtain the applicability condition of these equations , if we notice that in the linear wave @xmath40 and the nonlinear terms of the order of magnitude @xmath41 can be neglected as long as they are much less than the linear ones @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we get the criterion @xmath43 hence , if @xmath44 is large enough , the linear theory is applicable to description of waves outside the mach cone far enough from the obstacle , where the density amplitude @xmath45 of the wave satisfies the condition ( [ 10a ] ) . for harmonic waves",
    "@xmath46 $ ] the system ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) yields at once the dispersion relation @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "now we consider the stationary wave patterns far enough from the obstacle where the condition ( [ 10a ] ) is supposed to be fulfilled .",
    "in fact , this problem is analogous to the kelvin theory of ship waves generated by a ship moving in a deep water , but with a different dispersion law ( [ 3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "hence , we shall follow kelvin s method in its form presented in @xcite .",
    "first , we notice that in a stationary wave pattern @xmath49 and , hence , the components of the wavevector @xmath50 are the functions of the space coordinates @xmath51 connected with each other by the relationship @xmath52 where we have taken into account that for chosen geometry of the bec flow the wave must propagate upwind i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "next , the `` ship wave '' pattern corresponds to a modulated two - dimensional wave where the wavevector @xmath54 is a gradient of the phase @xcite , @xmath55 hence , the components @xmath56 satisfy the condition @xmath57 which , with an account of ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) , yields the equation for @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is defined by the derivative of an implicit function ( [ 3 - 3 ] ) : @xmath61 it follows from eq .",
    "( [ 3 - 6 ] ) that @xmath62 and @xmath58 are constant along the characteristics defined as solutions of the equation @xmath63    at last , since at large distances from the obstacle , the latter can be considered as a point - like source of waves , the resulting stationary wave is centered , that is the characteristics intersect at the point @xmath64 of the location of the obstacle .",
    "hence , we obtain the solution @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the angle between the @xmath8 axis and the radius - vector @xmath67 of the point @xmath68 with wavevector @xmath56 ; see fig .  1 where other convenient parameters are also defined , namely , the angle @xmath69 between the wavevector @xmath54 and a negative direction of the @xmath8 axis , and the angle @xmath70 between vectors @xmath54 and @xmath67 .",
    "normal to it at the point @xmath68 and coordinates @xmath66 and @xmath69 defining the parameters of the wave pattern at this point . , width=226,height=226 ]",
    "thus , we have @xmath71 @xmath72 then elementary calculation gives for ( [ 4 - 2 ] ) the expression @xmath73 and eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 4 ] ) yields @xmath74 thus , we have found that for a fixed value of @xmath69 the components @xmath56 are constant along the line @xmath75 with @xmath66 defined by eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 5 ] ) and the length of the wavevector given by ( [ 4 - 6 ] ) .",
    "therefore the phase ( [ 3 - 4 ] ) can be conveniently calculated by integration along the line @xmath75 with constant vector @xmath54 , so that @xmath76 it means that the lines of constant phase ( e.g. the wave crests ) @xmath77 are determined in parametrical form by eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 5 ] ) and @xmath78 where @xmath79 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 6 ] ) and @xmath80 can be calculated from @xmath81 which gives , after elementary algebra , the expression @xmath82 this expression permits one to express eq .",
    "( [ 5 - 2 ] ) as @xmath83 and eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 5 ] ) as @xmath84 at last , the curves with constant phase @xmath77 are given in cartesian coordinates by the formulas @xmath85 thus , we have found the expressions describing the linear wave pattern in a parametric form where the parameter @xmath69 changes in the interval @xmath86 for @xmath87 we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 , that is small values of @xmath69 correspond to the wave before the obstacle .",
    "the boundary values @xmath90 correspond to the lines @xmath91 that is the curves of constant phase become asymptotically the straight lines parallel to the mach cone . the general pattern is shown in fig .  2",
    "we have compared the above approximate analytical theory with the exact numerical solution of the gp equation , which in non - dimensional units ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) takes the standard form @xmath92 which corresponds for @xmath93 to the system ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) with @xmath94 in our simulations the obstacle was modeled by an impenetrable disk with radius @xmath95 .",
    "such an obstacle introduces large enough perturbation into the flow to generate an oblique solitons pair behind it ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that at the initial moment @xmath96 there is no disturbance in the condensate , so that it is described by the plane wave function @xmath97 corresponding to a uniform condensate flow . for large enough evolution time",
    ", the wave pattern around the obstacle tends to a stationary structure .",
    "an example of such a structure for @xmath98 is shown in fig .  2 .     and",
    "the radius of an impenetrable obstacle to @xmath95 . dashed line corresponds to the linear analytical theory for the line of constant phase .",
    "it corresponds to eqs .",
    "( [ 5 - 6 ] ) but the curve is shifted to 1 unit of length to the left from the center of the obstacle for better fitting to numerics . it should be noted that this distance is negligibly small in our theory corresponding to a point - like obstacle .",
    "a pair of oblique dark lines behind the obstacle correspond to spatial solitons studied in @xcite.,width=302,height=226 ]    a dashed line corresponds to the analytic theory developed in the preceding section ; as we see it agrees very well with the numerical results for @xmath98 .",
    "the condition ( [ 10a ] ) indicates that the nonlinear effects grow up with increase of @xmath44 . to demonstrate this explicitly ,",
    "we have compared the wavelength @xmath99 at @xmath89 calculated using the developed linear analytic theory with the same parameter obtained from our full numerical simulations . according to linear theory ,",
    "the wavelength at @xmath89 ( i.e. @xmath87 ) is constant and equal to @xmath100 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ 4 - 6 ] ) . in fig .  4 we compare this dependence of the wavelength @xmath99 on the mach number @xmath44 with the results of numerical simulations at the point with @xmath101 .",
    "as we see , eq .  ( [ 6 - 3 ] ) is very accurate for values of @xmath44 satisfying the condition ( [ 10a ] ) and discrepancy between analytical and numerical results slightly increases with increase of @xmath44 . in general , this plot confirms validity of a linear theory in the region of its applicability .",
    "we have developed here the theory of linear waves generated by the flow of bec past an obstacle .",
    "the linear approximation is correct for small enough amplitudes of the perturbation .",
    "this condition is satisfied in the case of small disturbance introduced by the obstacle and not too high values of the mach number .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm the analytical theory in the region of its applicability ."
