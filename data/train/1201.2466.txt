    "recently , the diffusion equations that generalize the usual one have received considerable attention due to the broadness of their physical applications , in particular , to the anomalous diffusion .",
    "in fact , fractional diffusion equations and the nonlinear fractional diffusion equations have been successfully applied to several physical situations such as percolation of gases through porous media [ 1 ] , thin saturated regions in porous media [ 2 ] , standard solid - on - solid model for surface growth [ 3 ] , thin liquid films spreading under gravity [ 4 ] , in the transport of fluid in porous media and in viscous fingering [ 5 ] , modeling of non - markvian dynamical processes in protein folding [ 6 ] , relaxation to equilibrium in system ( such as polymer chains and membranes ) with long temporal memory [ 7 ] , and anomalous transport in disordered systems [ 8 ] , diffusion on fractals [ 9 ] , and the multi - physical transport in porous media , such as electroosmosis[10 - 11 ] .",
    "the properties concerning these equations have also been investigated .",
    "for instance , in [ 12 ] boundary values problems for fractional diffusion equations are studied , in [ 13 ] a fractional fokker - planck equation is derived from a generalized master equation , in [ 14 ] the behavior of fractional diffusion at the origin is analyzed and a connection between the fox h functions and the fractional diffusion equations was investigated in [ 15 ] . also a generalization of brownian motion to multidimensional anomalous diffusion",
    "is considered by using fractional differential equation in [ 16 ] , and a fractional radial diffusion was considered in [ 17 ] .    in this direction , we dedicate this work to investigate a fractional diffusion equation which employs space and time fractional derivatives by taking a time - dependent diffusion coefficient , an external force and @xmath0-dimensional into account .",
    "more precisely , we focus our attention on the following equation @xmath1^{\\nu}\\}-\\frac{1}{x^{\\mathcal{n}-1}}\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x}\\{x^{\\mathcal{n}-1}f(x)\\rho(x , t)\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath0 is the number of dimensions , and the diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath3 , which is a spatial time - dependent diffusion coefficient , and @xmath4 is an external force ( drift ) associated with the potential @xmath5 . here , we use the caputo operator for the fractional derivative with respect to time @xmath6 and the riesz - weyl operator for the fractional derivative with respect to spatial @xmath7 [ 18 ] .",
    "we work with the positive spatial variable @xmath7 .",
    "later on , we will extend the results to the entire real @xmath7-axis by the use of symmetry ( in other words , we are working with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "also , we employ , in general , the initial condition @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is a given function ) , and the boundary condition @xmath12 . for eq.(1 ) , one can prove that @xmath13 is time independent ( hence , if @xmath14 is normalized at @xmath15,it will remain so forever ) .",
    "indeed , if we write eq.(1 ) as @xmath16 , and , for simplicity , assume the boundary conditions @xmath17 , it can be shown that @xmath18 is a constant of motion ( see [ 19 ] and references therein ) .",
    "note that eq.(1 ) recovers the usual radial diffusion equation with memory effect for @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath20 and @xmath21 , eq.(1 ) recovers the standard fokker - planck equation in the presence of a drift taking memory effects and @xmath0-dimensional into account .",
    "the particular case @xmath22 ( no drift ) and @xmath23 with @xmath24 has been considered by spohn [ 3 ] .",
    "the case @xmath25 with @xmath26 and the case @xmath27 with @xmath26 have been investigated in [ 20 ] and [ 21 ] , respectively . in [ 22 ] , the solution for eq.(1 ) with the boundary condition @xmath28 was investigated .",
    "explicit solutions play an important role in analyzing physical situations , since they contain , in principle , precise information about the system .",
    "in particular , they can be used as a useful guide to control the accuracy of numerical solutions . for these reasons",
    ", we dedicated to this work to investigate the solutions to eq.(1 ) .",
    "we consider different scenarios involving the diffusion coefficient and external force .",
    "firstly , in the case of the absence of external force , we consider a spatial time - dependent diffusion coefficient given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "secondly , the presence of external force is investigated , which is given by @xmath31 .",
    "thirdly , a mixing between the spatial and time fractional derivatives case is investigated .",
    "lastly , we consider a particular case as @xmath19 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 arbitraries . in all the above situations ,",
    "eq.(1 ) satisfies the initial condition @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is a given function ) , and the boundary condition @xmath37.the remainder of this paper goes as follow . in sec.2 , we obtain the exact solutions for the previous cases . in sec.3",
    ", we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we start our discussion by considering eq.(1 ) in the absence of external force with @xmath38 ( @xmath32),@xmath26 and @xmath39 , @xmath34 arbitrary . for this case , eq.(1 ) reads @xmath40 here , we use the caputo operator [ 18 ] for the fractional derivative with respect to time @xmath6 . by employing the laplace transform in eq.(2 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 denotes the laplace transform of the function @xmath45 .",
    "this equation can be solved by green function method [ 23 ] . by substituting @xmath46 into eq.(3 ) , which yields @xmath47 in order to solve eq.(5 ) , it is convenient to perform the transform [ 24 ] @xmath48 to translate eq.(5 ) into the second - order bessel equation as @xmath49 with parameter @xmath50 under the following conditions : @xmath51^\\frac{1}{2},\\lambda=\\frac{2+\\theta-\\mathcal{n}}{2+\\theta},\\delta=\\frac{2+\\theta-\\mathcal{n}}{2+\\theta}.\\ ] ] since eq.(5 ) should fit the boundary condition @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 , we get the solution of eq.(5 ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the modified bessel function of second kind , and @xmath56 can be determined by the normalization of @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 . after some calculations , we obtain @xmath59 here , we have used the formula @xmath60 * case 1 .",
    "* @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath61 .",

    "the present of fox function in eq.(5 ) may be associated to the changes produced on the probability density function for a waiting time that , for this case , has a long tailed behavior , in contrast to the usual one . at this point , it is interesting to analyze the asymptotic behavior of eq.(13 ) [ 25 ] . for simplicity , we consider @xmath67 , so @xmath68 and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath69 is @xmath70 @xmath71 in this direction , eq.(14 ) can be considered as an extension of the asymptotic behavior of homogeneous and isotropic random walk models [ 26 ] . + * case 2 .",

    ", an exact solution can be obtained and it is given by @xmath83{cr}(1-\\frac{\\mathcal{n}\\gamma}{2+\\theta},\\gamma)\\\\(\\frac{\\mathcal{k}}{(2+\\theta)d},1),(\\frac{2+\\theta-\\mathcal{n}}{2+\\theta},1)\\end{array}\\right.\\right],\\ ] ] where , for simplicity , we are considering the initial condition @xmath84 , and the external force ( drift ) @xmath85 .",
    "the second moment is given by @xmath86 , which scales with the exponent @xmath87 and clearly depends only on @xmath39 and @xmath34 .",
    "so , when @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the system is sub - diffusion , normal diffusion and supper - diffusion respectively .",
    "let us now discuss eq.(1 ) in the presence of the external force by employing a mixing between the spatial and time fractional derivatives . for simplicity , we consider @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
