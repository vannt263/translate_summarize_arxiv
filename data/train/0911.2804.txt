    "the discovering in the early 1980 s of non - periodic crystals , soon called _ quasicrystals _ , renewed the interest in _",
    "tilings_. indeed , tilings show that a _ global _ property such as non - periodicity can sometimes be enforced by purely _ local _ ( hence physically realistic ) constraints , namely the way neighbor tiles can match .",
    "the most celebrated example is probably the _ penrose tilings _ , which are decagonal rhombus tilings of the plane whose non - periodicity can be enforced just by specifying the way rhombi are allowed to fit around a vertex .",
    "several books have since been written on quasicrystals , and even those focusing on physical properties have a chapter on tilings , with penrose tilings in the first place ( the interested reader can easily found numerous references ) .",
    "+ tilings are also widely studied in statistical mechanics , in particular _",
    "dimer tilings_. these are tilings of a bounded subset of a planar grid either by dominoes ( square grid ) or rhombi ( triangular grid ) . the aim is to understand statistical properties of the set of tilings of a given domain , called a _",

    "e.g. _ , to the recent survey @xcite .",
    "+ strongly related to tilings is the notion of _ flip _ ( also called _ phason - flip _ or simply _ phason _ ) .",
    "a flip is the local operation which acts on rhombus tiling by rotating @xmath5 a hexagon made of three rhombi a square made of two dominoes . ] .",
    "flips may model transformations which occur in real ( quasi)crystals @xcite . the general aim , which inspires this paper , is to understand the flip dynamics on tiling spaces .",
    "+ in particular , the flip dynamics is said to be _ ergodic _ if the more flips are performed on a tiling , the closer it is from a typical tiling ( that is , a tiling chosen uniformly at random in the tiling space ) .",
    "ergodicity thus provides , when it holds , an algorithmic method to numerically investigate statistical properties of tiling spaces .",
    "ergodicity have been proven first for dimer tilings @xcite and then for any rhombus tilings @xcite ( for simply connected domains ) .",
    "+ however , ergodicity does not tell anything about the number of flips which shall be performed before being relatively close to a typical tiling .",
    "this is not only a drawback from a computational viewpoint ( how far a simulation shall be run ? ) , but can also lead to physical mispredictions : ergodicity can yield properties that have no chance to be experimentally observed because the flip dynamics is much too slow .",
    "ergodicity results can be refined by studying the _ mixing time _ of the markov process whose steps consist in performing a flip on a vertex chosen uniformly at random ( when possible ) .",
    "a polynomial bound on the mixing time of dimer tilings have been obtained in @xcite , relying on the analysis of a related markov chain @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments suggest that a similar bound holds for rhombus tilings whose rhombi are defined over four possible edge directions ( octogonal tilings ) @xcite .",
    "+ in this context , the motivation of this paper comes from the model of quasicrystal growth introduced in @xcite . starting from a typical tiling ( assumed to be an entropically - stabilized quasicrystal at high temperature ) ,",
    "flips are randomly performed , with the probability of each flip depending on its neighborhood ( assumed to model the energy of the quasicrystal ) .",
    "this process can be seen as the minimization of the energy of a tiling by a stochastic gradient descent in the tiling space .",
    "the question is whether a minimal energy tiling is reached ( a sort of partial ergodicity ) , and at which rate ( mixing time ) . in other word , the question is whether the shortest paths ( in terms of flips ) of tiling spaces are enough `` regular '' to be easily found by the gradient descent . as an attempt to measure this regularity",
    ", this paper introduces a distance , called hamming - distance , and compares it to the above flip - distance .",
    "+ the main result obtained in this paper is that rhombus tiling spaces are regular when rhombi are defined over at most four edge directions ( dimer or octogonal tilings ) , but loose this regularity for five directions ( decagonal tilings ) or more . theorem  [ th : main ] formally states this in section  [ sec : comparison ] . before , section  [ sec : tilings ] and [ sec : distances ]",

    "it is said to be _ positive _ if @xmath24 , _ negative _ otherwise .",
    "since a pseudoline drawn in a ribbon of a tiling also appears in any other tiling of the same domain , the notion of triangle depends not on a particular tiling but on a rhombus tiling space . however , since the representation of a pseudoline depends on the particular tiling it is drawn on , so does also the representation of a triangle .",
    "in particular , a triangle can have a different sign in two tilings of the same space : it is said to be _ inverted _ with respect to these two tilings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : triangles ] ) .",
    "the _ hamming - distance _ between two tilings of a rhombus tiling space is the number of triangles which have different sign in these two tilings .",
    "if we associate with each tiling of a rhombus tiling space a string whose @xmath25-th symbol is the sign in this tiling of the @xmath25-th triangle , then the hamming - distance between two tilings is exactly the usual hamming distance between their associated strings .",
    "one can moreover show that such a string completly characterizes the tiling it is associated with .",
    "+ the hamming - distance provides a natural and simple lower bound on the flip - distance .",
    "indeed , since each flip changes the sign of exactly one triangle , transforming a tiling into another one requires at least as many flips as there are triangles with a different sign in the two tilings .",

    "computing the hamming - distance between two tilings can be done very efficiently ( in sesquilinear time in the size of the tilings ) .",
    "the equality of flip- and hamming distance has thus also important implications from a computational viewpoint ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hamming ] ) .",
    "this theorem is established by several lemmas which depend on the number or size of bundles of pseudoline arrangements associated with rhombus tiling spaces ( next subsections ) , as well as on the following general lemma :    [ lem : main ] the flip- and hamming - distances are equal on a rhombus tiling space if , for any two distinct tilings , each tiling admits an inclusion - minimal triangle with a different sign in the other tiling .",

    "it starts with a triangle which is assumed to be inverted w.r.t .",
    "two tilings of the space ( such a triangle exists for any two different tilings ) .",
    "it then considers all the way an additional pseudoline can cut this triangle , and recursively searches for either an inverted triangle which can not any more be cut by any pseudoline , or a configuration with none of its inclusion - minimal triangles inverted .",
    "lemma  [ lem : main ] then ensures that flip- and hamming distances are equal in the former case , or different in the latter case .",
    "+ let us here describe precisely how the program works , since it is not that straightforward .",
    "first , let us define the following rooted tree :    1 .",
    "each node corresponds to a pseudoline arrangement , where triangles are labelled `` inverted '' or `` non - inverted '' .",
    "2 .   nodes can be of type ` and ` or ` or ` , with nodes ` and ` having a distinguished `` inverted '' inclusion - minimal triangle ; 3 .",
    "the root is a node ` and ` corresponding to a single ( distinguished ) triangle ; 4 .",
    "the children of a node ` and ` are nodes ` or ` , one for each way a pseudoline can be added which cut the distinguished triangle and the created triangles can be consistently labelled `` inverted '' or `` non - inverted '' ; 5 .",
    "the children of a node ` or ` are nodes ` and ` , one for each `` inverted '' inclusion - minimal triangle which do not appear in the parent node ` and ` , with this `` inverted '' triangle being distinguished .",
    "we then _ evaluate _ this tree as follows : leaves ` and ` and ` or ` are respectively evaluated to ` true ` and ` false ` , while nodes ` and ` and ` or ` are respectively evaluated to the conjunction and the disjunction of the evaluations of their children .",
    "it is not hard to see that if the root is evaluated to ` true ` , then any pair of different tilings shall admit an inverted minimal - inclusion triangle .",
    "+ the above defined tree has however no reason to be finite ( remind that we are not considering a particular zonotope , but an infinite family , that is , there is a restriction of the number of pseudoline bundles , but not on the number of pseudolines ) .",
    "it nevertheless may admit a subtree with the same root , such that if the root of this subtree is evaluated to ` true ` , then the root of the general tree can only be evaluated to ` true ` .",
    "indeed , whenever a child of a node ` or ` is evaluated to ` true ` , the evaluation of the other children does not matter : this allows to ignore large parts of the general tree , hopefully enough to obtain a finite subtree .",
    "such a subtree , in the case its root is evaluated to ` true ` , provides a proof that any pair of different tilings admit an inverted minimal - inclusion triangle ( hence that flip- and hamming - distances are equal , by lemma  [ lem : main ] ) : we call it a _ proof - subtree _",
    "( there may be several ones ) .",
    "+ the above approach can only prove equality since it focus on the evaluation to ` true ` of the root .",
    "however , the leaves ` or ` discovered while searching a proof - subtree are good counterexample candidates .",
    "indeed , such a leaf corresponds to a pseudoline arrangement where , at least locally , no inclusion - minimal triangle is inverted . if this also holds through the whole pseudoline arrangement , then lemma  [ lem : main ] yields that flip- and hamming - distances are not equal .",
    "thus , while searching for a proof - subtree , our program also outputs leaves ` or ` , and we separatly check whether they are counterexample or not .",
    "+ it remains to explain the strategy of our program for skipping large parts of the general tree while exploring it .",
    "there are two main principles .",
    "+ the first principle is that , when adding a pseudoline @xmath52 which cuts a distinguished triangle , we systematically assume that this pseudoline is , among the pseudolines in the same bundle which cross the same edges of the triangle , the closest one to one of the three vertex of the triangle ( this is exactly what we did several times in the proof of lemma  [ lem : four_bundles ] , actually , the program just mimics the proof in the more complicated five - bundle case ) .",
    "this allows to endow sections of the triangle edges with a label specifying that they can not be cut by a pseudoline of this bundle . while recursively adding new pseudolines during the tree exploration , we add more and more such labels : this is precisely what leads to nodes where no pseudoline crossing the distinguished triangle can be added , that is , leaves ` and ` evaluated to ` true ` . +",
    "the second principle is to combine depth - first and breadth - first searches according to a well - chosen trade - off .",
    "on the one hand , since we just want to find , for each node ` or ` , a child whose evaluation is ` true ` , it seems better to perform a breadth - first search that can be stopped as soon as such a child is found .",
    "but this breadth - first search is untractable in practice , because this leads to examine too much cases .",
    "however , since these cases are `` more or less promising '' ( depending on how looks the pseudoline arrangement and in which part of it an inverted inclusion - minimal triangle is searched ) , it is worth performing a depth - first search on the most `` promising '' ones .",
    "of course , it is very hard to estimate how much a given case is `` promising '' .",
    "we therefore proceed as follow : we associate a _ weight _ with each node",
    "whose children have not all been explored ",
    "the most `` promising '' seems a node , according to some `` homemade '' heuristics , the heavier it is  and we perform each step of the search on the heavier node .",
    "weights are updated at each step .",
    "+ we shall also mention that , when searching for children of a node ` and ` , the program does not compute exactly the consistent labelling ( this is very time - consuming ) . instead of this",
    ", it considers all the labelling which are consistent w.r.t .",
    "lemmas [ lem : config1 ] and [ lem : config2 ] .",
    "this leads to possibly consider some extra labelling ( which are not detected as inconsistent ) , but this can only prevent the corresponding ` and ` node to be evaluated to ` true ` , that is , we can miss a proof - subtree but not obtain a false proof - subtree . +",
    "this concludes our description of the program ( which however contains several other tricky optimizations ",
    "the interested reader shall contact michael rao for more details ) .",
    "let us now discuss the results that we obtained .",
    "+ the main result is rather disappointing : this is a counterexample to our conjecture .",
    "the program indeed found a _",
    "deficient pair _",
    "( that is , a pair of tilings whose flip- and hamming - distances differ ) in the zonotope @xmath53 , namely the pair depicted on fig .  [",
    "fig : deficient_5 ] .",
    "let us stress that , once a pair is found , it can be easily checked that it is a counterexample : it indeed suffices to check that each inclusion - minimal triangle of one of the tilings has the same sign in the other tiling ( this can be valuable for readers who would dubiously regard computer - assisted proofs ) .",
    "+    : these tilings are at hamming - distance @xmath54 but at flip - distance @xmath55 .",
    "this deficiency can be checked by hand : the @xmath56 inclusion - minimal triangle of one tiling have indeed the same sign in the other tiling.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the program also found several other deficient pairs in this zonotope ( @xmath57 at all , up to symmetries ) , but there are possibly other ones ( that the program can have ignored while searching for a proof - subtree ) .",
    "an exhaustive checking of the pairs of this tiling space shall give all the deficient pairs , but it is beyond our computational resources .",
    "let us mention that the flip- and hamming - distances of all the found pairs differ only by @xmath58 .",
    "+ since the above counterexample can be easily extended to larger zonotope , the only remaining cases , among five - bundle rhombus tiling spaces , are those associated with the zonotopes @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the constraints on pseudoline number can be easily added to the program , and in both cases it found a proof - subtree .",
    "the one found for the zonotope @xmath59 has nodes , with leaves , and the one found for zonotopes @xmath60 has nodes , with leaves .",

    "such an exhaustive search is of course impossible for the infinite family of zonotopes @xmath60 .",

    "<S> the rhombus tilings of a simply connected domain of the euclidean plane are known to form a flip - connected space ( a flip is the elementary operation on rhombus tilings which rotates @xmath0 a hexagon made of three rhombi ) . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the study of a quasicrystal growth model , we are here interested in better understanding how `` tight '' rhombus tiling spaces are flip - connected . we introduce a lower bound ( hamming - distance ) on the minimal number of flips to link two tilings ( flip - distance ) , and we investigate whether it is sharp . </S>",
    "<S> the answer depends on the number @xmath1 of different edge directions in the tiling : positive for @xmath2 ( dimer tilings ) or @xmath3 ( octogonal tilings ) , but possibly negative for @xmath4 ( decagonal tilings ) or greater values of @xmath1 . a standard proof is provided for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cases , while the complexity of the @xmath4 case led to a computer - assisted proof ( whose main result can however be easily checked by hand ) .    </S>",
