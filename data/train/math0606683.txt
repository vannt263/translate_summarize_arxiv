    "[ sec : graph ] we relate cut ideals to the binary graph models of @xcite and to markov random fields . in section [ sec : split ] we relate cut ideals to phylogenetic models on split systems , due to bryant @xcite .",

    "our goal in this section is to relate the graph - theoretic operation of taking clique sums to the ideal - theoretic operation of taking the toric fiber product , as explained in @xcite .",
    "this operation will serve as a tool for reducing the computation of the cut ideals @xmath18 to cut ideals of smaller graphs ( and that , hence , involve fewer indeterminates ) .",

    "we define a new binomial which is easily seen to be in the cut ideal @xmath18 of the big graph : @xmath81 this construction works verbatim if we switch the components @xmath64 and @xmath65 , so that , for any binomial @xmath82 in @xmath71 and any ordered list @xmath78 of @xmath83 partitions of @xmath84 , we get a binomial @xmath85 in @xmath18 . moreover , if @xmath86 is any set of binomials in @xmath70 or in @xmath71 then we define @xmath87 as the union of all binomials of the form @xmath85 described above .",

    "indeed , in this case the singleton @xmath66 has only one ordered partition and @xmath88 is the ideal of @xmath95-minors of the corresponding matrix @xmath107 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath64 is the graph with one edge @xmath108 and @xmath65 is the graph with one edge @xmath109 , so @xmath110 , then @xmath111 is generated by the determinant of @xmath112 now suppose that @xmath19 is any tree with @xmath113 leaves .",
    "iterating the zero sum construction from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , we see that @xmath1 is the segre embedding of @xmath116 into @xmath44 .",
    "further generalization of example [ ex : segre ] leads to the following result .",
    "the toric variety @xmath1 is smooth if and only if @xmath19 is free of @xmath117 minors .",
    "we first prove the if - direction .",
    "if @xmath19 is free of @xmath117 minors , so all its simple cycles have length three , then @xmath19 can be built from @xmath118 and @xmath119 by taking repeated @xmath98-sums .",
    "both the ideals @xmath120 and @xmath121 are zero and live in polynomial rings with two and four unknowns respectively .",
    "thus @xmath122 is @xmath40 and @xmath123 is @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath98-sum construction amounts to taking segre products , hence @xmath125 this segre variety is smooth .",
    "the only - if direction says that any smooth @xmath1 has this special form . to prove this ,",
    "suppose that @xmath19 has @xmath117 as a minor .",

    "let @xmath128 denote this induced subgraph . using a forward reference to lemma [ lemma : induced ]",
    ", we note that @xmath129 is a face of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to prove that @xmath130 is not smooth .",
    "we saw in the introduction that @xmath51 and @xmath54 are not simple . using the familiar characterization of toric singularities @xcite",
    ", this implies that the corresponding toric varieties @xmath130 are not smooth .",
    "the same can be checked for cycles of length @xmath131 .    in the remaining case",

    "the cut polytope @xmath129 is the free join of two squares , a non - simple @xmath137-polytope .",
    "the following example naturally generalizes the graph @xmath132 we just discussed .",
    "[ ex : k5minuse ] let @xmath138 be the graph on five vertices obtained from the complete graph by deleting an edge . thus @xmath19 is the @xmath100-sum of the complete graph @xmath64 on @xmath139 and the complete graph @xmath65 on @xmath140 .",
    "since @xmath27 is generated by a quartic , we deduce that @xmath18 is generated by quadrics and quartics .",

    "we begin by giving a new proof of a known result .      by proposition [ treesubd ] and theorem [ thm : cutsplit ] , we have @xmath456 , where @xmath19 is the edge graph of a triangulation of the @xmath113-gon",
    ". such a planar graph can be decomposed into triangles using @xmath100-sums .",
    "the result hence follows from theorem [ thm : cutfiber ] .",
    "we now discuss the jukes - cantor ideals @xmath397 for some other cyclic split systems .",

    "table 1 reveals that the algebraic invariants for @xmath459 are generated in degree @xmath460 and the algebraic invariants for @xmath461 are generated in degree @xmath462 .",
    "conjectures [ conj : degree2 ] and conjecture [ conj : k_5 ] translate into conjectures as to which jukes - cantor ideals @xmath397 are generated by quadrics and which are generated by quartics . whether the generating degree @xmath463 for a cyclic split system can only decrease upon removal of a split is still unknown , in light of conjecture [ conj : delete ] .",

    "these _ split networks _ on @xmath113 taxa are thus in many - to - one correspondence , via theorem [ thm : cutsplit ] to graphs with @xmath113 vertices , and our results here shed light on the algebraic invariants of the associated statistical model @xcite",
    ". one concrete application of this correspondence to phylogenetics will be the exact computation of maximum likelihood parameters for splits models as described in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath464 and consider the bipartite graph @xmath465 where the bipartition separates @xmath466 from @xmath467 .",
