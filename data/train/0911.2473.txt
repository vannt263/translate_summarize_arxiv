    "( 2004a ) estimated continuum optical depths of @xmath9300 .",
    "however , high - resolution 7-mm radio continuum observations have revealed an extended ( @xmath370  au across ) source that reid et al .",
    "( 2007 ) proposed may be an ionized accretion disk surrounding an early b - type star .",
    "in addition to its proximity , orion  kl has the distinction of being one of only three star - forming regions known to exhibit sio maser emission ( hasegawa et al .",
    "1986 ; zapata et al .",
    "2009 ) , and these masers were definitively linked with  by menten & reid ( 1995 ) .",
    "sio masers offer key advantages for studying stellar sources in that they arise at small radii ( @xmath10  k , @xmath11  @xmath12 ) , are unaffected by extinction from dust and neutral gas , and can sample gas kinematics via emission line doppler shifts and proper motions .",
    "moreover , their high brightness temperature makes them observable with extraordinarily high angular resolution using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "indeed , previous vlbi observations have established that the sio masers lie at projected distances of @xmath320 - 100  au from ( greenhill et al .",

    "; kim et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these scales are of considerable interest , since they correspond to regions where accretion is expected to occur and where winds and outflows from ysos are expected to be launched and collimated . at present",
    ", little is known about the dynamics of these regions in higher mass ysos ( @xmath13 ) owing to the dearth of direct observations with the requisite resolution .",
    "consequently , persistent gaps in our knowledge of the formation process for ob stars have remained ( e.g. , bally & zinnecker 2005 ; zinnecker & yorke 2007 ; tan 2008 ) .",
    "we have used the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) to monitor the sio maser emission surrounding  at monthly intervals over several years ( see also greenhill et al .",
    "our images have higher dynamic range and higher cadence than any observations of the masers to date . here",
    "we showcase our results in the form of 19-epoch movies spanning 21 months .",
    "these movies chronicle for the first time the kinematics and evolution of the molecular material @xmath320 - 100  au from a massive yso .",
    "this is part of a series of papers examining  on 10 - 1000  au scales based on vlba monitoring and complementary observations of other maser and thermal lines using the very large array ( vla ) and the green bank telescope ( e.g. , goddi et al . 2009a , b and in preparation ; greenhill et al .",

    "together , these data are allowing us to forge a comprehensive new picture of  and its role in shaping the orion  kl region .",
    "the @xmath0sio @xmath1=1 and @xmath1=2 , @xmath2=1 - 0 transitions toward  ( @xmath14=@xmath1514.5098@xmath16 , @xmath17=@xmath18@xmath19 ) were observed using the vlba between 2001 march  19 and 2002 december  10 .",
    "the separation between observations was approximately one month , although no usable data were obtained during two months in mid-2002 ( table  1 ) .",
    "observations were made with the 10 antennas of the vlba , together with a single antenna from the vla .",
    "the @xmath1=1 and @xmath1=2 transitions were observed simultaneously , each in a single polarization ( rr ) with a 15.9  mhz bandwidth centered at 7.5  relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "the adopted rest frequencies for the @xmath1=1 and @xmath1=2 transitions were 43.122024  ghz and 42.820432  ghz , respectively .",
    "the data were processed with the vlba correlator , yielding 512 spectral channels with a spacing of @xmath30.2  in each of the two ifs .",
    "correlator dump times were 2.097  s. the total integration time on  during each epoch ( excluding calibration measurements ) was @xmath36 hours for each transition .",
    "we performed all data reduction using the astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ) .",
    "because our science goals require high precision , high dynamic range measurements , we took particular care to minimize systematic errors in each stage of our reduction and to maintain accurate astrometric registration between the @xmath1=1 and @xmath1=2 data ( which are very sensitive to delay calibration errors because of the 300  mhz frequency separation between transitions ) . to insure uniform processing of each epoch",
    ", we developed a partially automated pops script to facilitate the implementation of certain reduction steps .",
    "these semi - automated steps were interspersed with frequent manual checks of the data .",
    "corrections for errors in the _ a priori _ earth orientation parameter and station positions ( computed starting with the usno 2004b geodetic vlbi solution ) were applied to the data , followed by digital sampler corrections for the vlba correlator .",
    "if uncorrected , these position errors will lead to phase and delay errors which subsequently can not be calibrated out .",
    "next , a preliminary amplitude calibration was performed using the default gain curves and system temperatures provided by nrao .",
    "subsequently , an improved amplitude scale and pointing corrections were computed based on comparison of a time series of total - power spectra to a template for each station .",
    "one - time atmospheric delay and instrumental phase and delay offsets between the ifs were estimated from fringe fits to a one - minute portion of a calibrator scan ( 0528 + 134 or 4c39.25 ) , followed by a second fringe - fit to both calibrators ( including all times ) to solve for the residual delays and rates .",
    "solutions for both ifs were derived independently . however , after ensuring that no systematic offsets were present between the two sets of solutions , the rate solutions from if2 ( @xmath1=1 ) were copied and applied to if1 ( @xmath1=2 ) in order to minimize phase drifts between the two ifs ( which may in turn lead to astrometric misalignments between the two frequencies ) .",
    "the time series phase differences for the two ifs for each antenna were examined following these steps to verify that no phase wraps were present during the track .",
    "the amplitude portion of the bandpass calibration was computed using the total power data for the calibrators 0528 + 134 and 4c39.25 , and the phase portion was derived using a complex polynomial fit to the cross - power data of the same calibrators .",
    "time - dependent frequency shifts were then applied to the line data to compensate for changes caused by the earth s motion over the course of the observation .    to refine the astrometric position of the maser and further constrain delay - like errors in the calibration that would affect the relative astrometry of the @xmath1=1 and @xmath1=2 emission , a strong , compact @xmath1=1 maser reference feature was identified in each epoch through examination of cross - power spectra on a variety of baselines . each feature selected ( see table  2 ) was one that showed roughly constant visibility amplitudes as function of baseline length and orientation .",
    "a fringe fit was performed on this reference feature to determine fringe rates . following this ,",
    "a fringe - rate analysis was performed to solve for the position of the reference feature relative to the _ a priori _ correlator position .",
    "this analysis was performed outside of aips , using a non - linear least - squares algorithm to fit a sinusoid to the measured fringe rates as a function of time and simultaneously solve for a single vertical atmospheric delay error term in the correlator model for each station .",
    "the position offsets determined by this method ( table  2 ) were then applied to both ifs .",
    "typical uncertainties in ra and dec were 5  mas and 20  mas , respectively .",
    "the proximity of source  i to the celestial equator accounts for the larger uncertainty in the latter coordinate .",
    "self - calibration was performed on the @xmath1=1 reference channel , first in phase only , then in both amplitude and phase . typically a total of @xmath325 - 30 iterations was required . because the source s position on the sky compromises the @xmath20-@xmath1 coverage ,",
    "care was exercised to avoid artifacts in the clean component models used for each subsequent self - calibration iteration .",
    "final solutions were applied to the full spectral line data sets for both the @xmath1=1 and @xmath1=2 transitions . finally , several additional iterations of self - calibration were used to further improve the @xmath1=2 solutions before imaging the full line data sets .",
    "imaging and deconvolution of the fully calibrated sio data sets were performed using robust weighting ( briggs 1995 ) with @xmath21=0 .",
    "clean boxes were placed around emission regions in each spectral channel individually to reduce the effects of clean biasing ( e.g. , cotton 2007 ) .",
    "all channels were cleaned to a level of 20  mjy beam@xmath22 .",
    "this depth of cleaning balanced sidelobe removal against the production of deconvolution artifacts that may result from over - cleaning .",
    "these data are particularly susceptible to such artifacts as a result of a combination of the source s location on the sky and the limited @xmath20-@xmath1 coverage of the array .",
    "the resulting deconvolved images have a field - of - view of @xmath3@xmath23 , and in all cases we used a restoring beam of 0.55@xmath240.19  mas with a position angle of 0@xmath25 .",
    "the 1@xmath26 rms noise in individual channels ranged from @xmath38 - 10  mjy beam@xmath22 for line - free channels ( consistent with expected thermal noise ) to @xmath39 - 13  mjy beam@xmath22 for channels with strong line emission .",
    "our resulting imaging data have higher dynamic range ( up to @xmath38000 ) than any previously obtained vlbi maps of the  sio masers and also recover a significantly larger fraction of the total sio flux ( @xmath27% ; matthews et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "zeroth , first , and second moment maps were computed from each @xmath1=1 or @xmath1=2 data cube ( using the aips task momnt ) ; combined moments containing both transitions were also produced .",
    "consecutive epochs were registered by maximizing the cross - correlation between maps of the logarithm of the velocity - integrated intensity .",
    "this method removes any component of motion caused by a proper motion of  ( cf .",
    "gmez et al .",
    "2008 ; goddi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "when registering maps separated in time by roughly one month , this method appears to be robust to within approximately one pixel ( 0.05  mas ) , although for some epochs , misalignments between the two sio transitions of up to @xmath30.3  mas may be present as a result of residual calibration uncertainties .",

    "the contrast between the pattern of motions observed in the western bridge versus the arms (   [ proper ] ) strongly supports this interpretation , as shocked material would not be expected to have two apparent kinematic components ( both tangential and radially outward ) .",
    "moreover , owing to gradients in temperature and density between regions close to the disk plane and the outer reaches of the wind , shock conditions are unlikely to be similar over the scales of tens of au from  where maser motions are observed . finally , the multitude of linear maser trails seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nest ] also supports a kinematic interpretation for the sio masers ; features that move many times their characteristic sizes without significantly changing morphology would not be expected to arise as a shock front transverses a clumpy , inhomogeneous medium and are a strong indicator that we are tracing motions of individual clumps .",
    "one of the longstanding controversies surrounding  has been the mass of the central star .",
    "while our present data can offer important new constraints on this quantity , obtaining a precise mass estimate is complicated by the likelihood that the maser - emitting material is not in purely keplerian rotation ( see also kim et al .",
    "for example , some degree of turbulence is almost certain present in the gas ( e.g. , as evidenced by small - scale complexities in the radial velocity fields in the arm regions ) , and the outward motions of the maser clumps (   [ proper ] ) imply forces acting on the maser gas opposite to those of gravity ( e.g. , radiative and/or magnetic forces ) .",
    "such effects can lead to underestimates of the enclosed mass ( e.g. , knigl & pudritz 2000 ; pitu et al .",

    "moreover , the disk itself might contain up to a few solar masses of material ( reid et al .",

    "we assume that the bridge features lie at @xmath62  au in a circularly rotating disk ( i.e. , just outside the edge of ionized inner disk measured by reid et al .",
    "2007 ) and that the  disk has a nearly edge - on inclination to our line - of - sight ( @xmath63 ) . taking the mean space motion of the @xmath1=2 bridge features ( @xmath6413.5  ) then implies @xmath65 .",
    "a second mass estimate can be derived by assuming that the material within the four arms is part of an outflowing wind ( see   [ wind ] ) and therefore must be moving at or near escape velocity .",

    "these kinematically - derived masses are somewhat smaller than the estimate of reid et al .",
    "( 2007 ) based on the 7-mm radio continuum luminosity ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "since a star with @xmath69 would be unable to produce an  region and would not have sufficient luminosity to power the sio maser emission ( @xmath70 ; menten & reid 1995 ) , it therefore seems probable that  is somewhat higher than the above kinematically determined values  i.e .",

    "we therefore have measured the locations of the peak rotational velocity of the sio emission along the northeastern edge of the dark band that runs parallel to the disk midplane ( see fig .",

    "if dust is mixed with the sio maser - emitting gas as proposed by elitzur ( 1982 ) , then radiation pressure on the grains could also influence the gas kinematics , assuming the grains can efficiently transfer some of their momentum to the gas .",
    "this would again lead to observed velocities that are smaller than predicted by kepler s law for a given mass .",
    "however , estimating the magnitude of this effect on the observed gas velocities will depend on the intrinsic stellar mass and luminosity , as well as the detailed properties of the grains  all of which are uncertain ( e.g. , kwok 1975 ) . moreover , it is unclear whether dust could survive at the temperatures expected near the base of the  wind ( @xmath752000  k ; goddi et al .",

    "we emphasize that the interpretation of  as a single , luminous yso with @xmath71-@xmath72 seems to provide the simplest explanation for _ both _ the radio continuum observations and the sio maser kinematics .",
    "a binary of equivalent mass , or a less massive , less luminous star , would not be able to produce the observed radio continuum emission nor provide the necessary luminosity to power the sio masers .",
    "on the other hand , a significantly more massive star would be difficult to reconcile with the observed sio kinematics ( i.e. , the transverse motions in the bridges , which we interpret as material orbiting the central mass , and the systematically outward motions in the arms , which we interpret as material traveling at or near escape velocity ) .",

    "we conclude that in the absence of more sophisticated calculations , we can not rule out disk augmentation or rebuilding via bondi - hoyle accretion may have occurred during the past 500  yr . however , we note that one additional caveat is that disks formed in this manner are predicted to have rather chaotic and asymmetric structures ( e.g. , krumholz et al . ) , in contrast to the  case .",

    "wright et al . ( 1995 ) proposed a slightly different scenario  namely that the sio masers arise from material ablated from the surface of an accretion disk by a wind or outflow .",

    "it thus appears that line - mediated radiation pressure is unlikely to play a significant role in powering the outward migrations of the sio maser - emitting gas around .",

    "although we can not yet exclude this general class of model for driving the  wind , several of the previous assumptions made by elitzur ( 1982 ) require revision as a result of more recent , high - resolution observations .",

    "<S> we present multi - epoch very long baseline array ( vlba ) imaging of the @xmath0sio @xmath1=1 and @xmath1=2 , @xmath2=1 - 0 maser emission toward the massive young stellar object ( yso ) orion . </S>",
    "<S> both sio transitions were observed simultaneously with an angular resolution of @xmath30.5  mas ( @xmath30.2  au for @xmath4=414  pc ) and a spectral resolution of @xmath30.2  . </S>",
    "<S> here we explore the global properties and kinematics of the emission through two 19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months ( 2001 march 19 to 2002 december 10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these movies provide the most detailed view to date of the dynamics and temporal evolution of molecular material within @xmath320 - 100  au of a massive ( @xmath5 ) yso . as in previous studies , we find that the bulk of the sio masers surrounding   lie in an x - shaped locus ; the emission in the south and east arms is predominantly blueshifted and emission in the north and west is predominantly redshifted . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , bridges of intermediate - velocity emission are observed connecting the red and blue sides of the emission distribution . we have measured proper motions of over 1000 individual maser features and find that these motions are characterized by a combination of radially outward migrations along the four main maser - emitting arms and motions tangent to the intermediate - velocity bridges . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the sio masers as arising from a wide - angle bipolar wind emanating from a rotating , edge - on disk . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of maser features along extended , curved filaments suggests that magnetic fields may play a role in launching and/or shaping the wind . </S>",
    "<S> our observations appear to support a picture in which stars with masses as high as at least @xmath6 form via disk - mediated accretion . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can not yet rule out that the  disk may have been formed or altered following a recent close encounter . </S>"
