    "since the successful development of helioseismology in the last few decades , the interest in extending the work to other stars has become clear .",
    "however , the small amplitudes expected in the power spectra of stars with solar - like oscillations makes this a very difficult task and to date no unambiguous detection has been made .",
    "the main limitation is the atmospheric noise .    on the other hand ,",
    "these stellar spectra are expected to have regular patterns that can be detected even without a full determination of the @xmath0-mode frequencies .",
    "some efforts have been made in this direction ( brown et al .",
    "1991 ; pottasch , butcher & van hoesel 1992 ; kjeldsen et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the most interesting parameters that can be obtained in this limit are the so - called small and large separations , as demonstrated by several theoretical analyses ( e.g.  1984 , 1988 , 1993 ; ulrich 1986 ; gough 1987 ; gough & novotny 1993 )",
    ".    however , the full power of asteroseismology for solar - like stars would , as in the case of helioseismology , require extensive determination of individual @xmath0-mode frequencies .",
    "in fact , once the observed amplitudes are above the noise level , a few weeks of observations will be enough to obtain accurate frequency measurements . in the near future",
    "there will be space missions devoted to asteroseismology ( baglin 1991 ; catala et al .",
    "1995 ) which , we hope , will give the first firm results on this issue . with these future observations in mind , in this paper we shall assume that a full set of low - degree ( @xmath1 ) @xmath0-mode frequencies are available in a given frequency range",
    ". we do not consider modes of higher degree because they can not be detected with simple photometric observations .",
    "also , we suppose that the radial order @xmath2 and the degree @xmath3 of the modes are known , and , of course , that the frequencies have been corrected for their rotational splittings .",
    "the determination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 requires comparison with the models but for solar - like stars on the main sequence , such as we shall consider here , it is plausible to assume that this is possible without any uncertainty .    as in the solar case",
    ", a direct comparison of theoretical and observed frequencies would be inconclusive .",
    "however , stellar acoustic oscillations satisfy a simple asymptotic relation which allows the separation of the contribution of the upper layers , such as the convective envelope , from that of the deep interior . this relation has been used extensively in the solar case , for instance to obtain the sound speed ( e.g.  , gough & thompson 1989 ) and to analyse the upper layers ( e.g.  prez hernndez &  1994b ) . since for the distant stars we expect to detect only low - degree modes , we re - analyse the relation in this context .",
    "a similar investigation was carried out recently by lopes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , to investigate what would be the diagnostic potential of observing solar - like oscillations in the star @xmath4 virginis .",
    "analysis of observations of low - degree solar @xmath0-modes is illustrative of what can be inferred for other stars .",
    "thus we first present an analysis of the observations by lazrek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , obtained with the golf instrument on the soho spacecraft . having demonstrated that it is possible to carry out the asymptotic analysis for stars , we concentrate our work on the upper layers as probed by the so - called phase function .",
    "we investigate the information that can be obtained from this function , taking into account the plausible accuracy of the frequency determinations .",
    "we pay particular attention to the second helium ionization zone .",
    "neglecting the perturbations in the gravitational potential and considering the waves locally as plano - parallel under constant gravity , the frequencies of @xmath0 modes satisfy the asymptotic relation @xcite @xmath5^{1/2 }   \\frac{\\dd r}{c }   \\ ; . \\label{as1}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 is the angular frequency , @xmath7 the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath8 the buoyancy frequency , @xmath9 the cut - off frequency and @xmath10 the lamb acoustic frequency .",
    "the integral is over radius @xmath11 with the limits @xmath12 and @xmath13 defined by the vanishing of the bracket in the integral . in principle",
    ", the asymptotic theory gives @xmath14 but since close to the surface the asymptotic conditions are not satisfied , @xmath15 is assumed to be a function of frequency , yet to be determined  for low - degree modes its dependence on @xmath3 is negligible .",
    "it is interesting to note that with the sole assumption that the perturbations in the gravitational potential can be neglected , equation  ( [ as1 ] ) still holds in the asymptotic limit , provided @xmath9 and @xmath8 are replaced by more general functions @xcite .    for the sun , and many other stars , equation  ( [ as1 ] ) can be further approximated to yield a very useful relation .",
    "if there is a point @xmath16  usually in the convective envelope  such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 , then it can be shown that equation  ( [ as1 ] ) can be approximated by ( e.g.  & prez hernndez 1992 )    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 here @xmath25 , @xmath3 being the degree of the mode , and @xmath26 .",
    "the integral in equation  ( [ fw ] ) is from the lower turning point @xmath27 ( defined by the vanishing of the bracket in the integral ) to the surface radius @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the phase function @xmath29 depends on conditions near the stellar surface .",
    "this phase function can be computed from the structure of the upper layers of a stellar model , by fitting numerically computed eigenfunctions to an asymptotic approximation at a point where the latter is valid ( see  & prez hernndez 1992 ) .",
    "we denote the phase function obtained in this way @xmath30 and the corresponding related function as defined in equation  ( [ gw ] ) is denoted @xmath31 . since , in this case , the wave equations are integrated from the surface down to a point in the envelope , by construction @xmath32 and @xmath33 depend only on the upper layers . the continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] corresponds to @xmath34 for a solar model without diffusion , ( , proffitt & thompson 1993 ) , in the following referred to as model  a.    it is interesting to note that the well - known tassoul equation @xcite , which is an approximation valid for low - degree modes , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cyclic frequency and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants , is a particular case of equation  ( [ as2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to show that in this approximation @xmath41 and @xmath42 a detailed derivation of equation  ( [ tas ] ) from equation  ( [ as2 ] ) was given by vorontsov ( 1991 ) ( see also gough 1986 ) .",
    "if the radial order @xmath2 and the degree @xmath3 are assumed to be known , @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be estimated from @xmath0-mode frequencies by fitting them to equation  ( [ as2 ] ) .",
    "hence these functions are potentially observable quantities for solar - like stars .",
    "this is the advantage of using equation  ( [ as2 ] ) rather than the formally more precise equation  ( [ as1 ] ) . in the present work we have made a least - squares fit , expanding @xmath43 and @xmath45 in terms of legendre polynomials in @xmath46 and @xmath6 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are legendre polynomials of order @xmath50 with coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 are linearly related to @xmath46 and @xmath6 , respectively , and are defined in the interval @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "note that from such a fit @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be obtained only to within a constant . throughout the paper we use the same mode data set , consisting of modes with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the interval in @xmath2 has been chosen such as to reject modes with very low amplitudes , which are not expected to be observed in solar - like stars .",
    "we note that rather similar results are obtained if modes with @xmath58 are added .",
    "the fit was carried out through @xmath59 minimization , using frequency errors obtained in early observations with the golf instrument on the soho spacecraft ( lazrek et al .",
    "1997 ) . in equation  ( [ fitfun ] ) we have used legendre polynomials of order 14 for each function .",
    "we note in passing that , as suggested by equation ( [ lowlf ] ) , the expansion of @xmath43 is most reasonably carried out in terms of @xmath60 . in this case a value @xmath61 in the expansion of @xmath43 is sufficient to achieve a good fit .",
    "but in any case this does not affect to the determination of @xmath45 with which we are mainly concerned in this work .",
    "this kind of fit for @xmath45 is rather similar to that used in inversion techniques ( e.g.  dziembowski , pamyatnykh & sienkiewicz 1990 ) though in that case the fit is usually done to a function corresponding to differences between models rather than to @xmath45 directly . on the other hand , vorontsov ,",
    "baturin & pamyatnykh ( 1992 ) applied a very similar fit to solar @xmath0 modes , but considering modes with higher degrees .",
    "for the sun , equation  ( [ as2 ] ) is a good approximation for modes of moderate degree , in particular for those modes with inner turning points between the base of the convection zone and the second helium ionization zone .",
    "when this kind of mode set is used , the asymptotic function @xmath31 and the numerically fitted @xmath45 agree very well .",
    "therefore , the observational @xmath45 can be used as a test of the upper layers . however , when only low - degree modes are included , such as is the case for other stars , the approximations leading to equation  ( [ as2 ] ) are not so accurate and hence larger differences between @xmath33 and @xmath62 are expected .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the dashed line corresponds to @xmath45 for model  a ( since @xmath62 is obtained to within a constant , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the following figures we choose the constant such that all the functions agree at a given frequency ) .",
    "indeed , there are significant differences between @xmath45 and @xmath34 , the main difference coming from neglecting the perturbations in the gravitational potential in equation  ( [ as2 ] ) .",
    "this can easily be checked by determining the corresponding function @xmath63 by fitting to @xmath0-mode frequencies computed in the cowling approximation .",
    "this is shown by the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "it is indeed much closer to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath62 obtained from the observations is a sum of @xmath64 that depends on the upper layers and a function that depends on the perturbation in the gravitational potential throughout the solar interior .    for completeness",
    "we also note that the function @xmath43 obtained from a fit to equation  ( [ as2 ] ) does not agree with the asymptotic expression  ( [ fw ] ) , except if the frequencies in the cowling approximation are used .      in principle ,",
    "equation  ( [ as2 ] ) can be improved by including the perturbation in the gravitational potential . to first order",
    ", the result is an additional term with a specific dependence on @xmath65 and @xmath66 , such that equation  ( [ as2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that if @xmath43 , @xmath45 and @xmath68 are solutions of a fit to equation  ( [ as3 ] ) then so are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 for any constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in particular , it is not possible to separate the contributions of the upper layers , as given by @xmath33 , from the zero - order term of @xmath74 since in any fit to observational data both would be included in @xmath45 .",
    "we consider again the function @xmath62 obtained from a fit to equation  ( [ as2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the dotted line represents @xmath75 with a suitable ( positive ) value for the constant @xmath76 ( as well as including the constant shift mentioned above ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath77 .",
    "had we done a fit to equation  ( [ as3 ] ) , we would have obtained a similar discrepancy due to the undetermined constant @xmath73 .",
    "thus , in what concerns the determination of @xmath62 , a fit to equation  ( [ as3 ] ) is equivalent to a fit to equation  ( [ as2 ] ) .",
    "we shall now argue that , when considering a pair of models ( or a model and the observations ) , the differences in @xmath74 are very small and hence @xmath78 . to a first approximation , the function @xmath74 is given by ( e.g. vorontsov 1991 ; christensen - dalsgaard 1996 ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the density .",
    "since we are dealing with low - degree modes , @xmath74 can be approximated by a taylor expansion in @xmath81 around the centre . from equation  ( [ pw ] )",
    ", we have @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the mean density , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 are dimensionless functions .",
    "also , by setting @xmath87 as the independent variable and integrating equation  ( [ pw ] ) by parts twice , it follows that @xmath88 thus , the variation of @xmath74 is of second order in @xmath89 , and in the @xmath89 interval spanned by our data set @xmath74 can be estimated by its value at the centre .    from equation  ( [ pw0 ] )",
    ", it follows that , for models with the same mean density and similar structure in the inner region , the functions @xmath74 are similar ; hence , when considering differences between pair of such models , this term can be neglected .",
    "in fact , numerical tests show that for realistic solar models the differences between @xmath45 are very close to the corresponding differences in @xmath31 .",
    "hence , although the function @xmath45 depends also on properties of the interior , differences between such functions depend mainly on the differences between the uppermost layers . for distant stars",
    "the mean density is generally not known with sufficient accuracy ; however , in this case it is likely that similar cancellation can be achieved by working in terms of frequencies measured in units of the large frequency separation @xmath90 ( cf .",
    "equation [ tas ] ) which scales approximately as @xmath91 .    in order to illustrate the dependence of @xmath45 on stellar structure , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show this function for three solar models and the mode set indicated above .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the previously mentioned model  a , the dotted line to a model that includes helium settling ( christensen - dalsgaard , proffitt & thompson 1993 , hereafter model  b ) and the dot - dashed line to a solar model that in addition has an artificial increase in the surface opacities in order to get a better agreement with the observations ( hereafter model  c ) . as a result of helium settling ,",
    "the envelope helium abundance @xmath92 of models  b and c is lower than the value @xmath93 for model  a. on the other hand , model  c differs substantially from the other two in the uppermost layers .",
    "as can be seen , the function @xmath45 for this model is also significantly different . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we also show @xmath45 computed with the observed frequencies @xcite , with errors estimated by monte - carlo simulation . as expected , model  c is closest to the observational data .",
    "( note that , since the superficial layers of the solar model suffers from other uncertainties , such as non - adiabatic and convective effects , it can not on this basis be concluded that model  c is better than the other two . )",
    "this result is similar to that obtained by using intermediate - degree modes .    for distant stars with poorly known parameters ,",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath94 can eventually become comparable with the differences in @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", it may be better to work with a phase function invariant under the transformation @xmath95 or , equivalently , @xmath96 .",
    "it is easy to show that the phase function @xmath97 has this property and hence depends only on the upper layers .",
    "this is a generalization of @xmath98 which has been used in earlier investigations ( e.g. brodsky & vorontsov 1988 ; christensen - dalsgaard & prez - hernndez 1991 ; lopes et al .",
    "1997 ) , and which is invariant only under the transformation @xmath99 .",
    "we note that the function @xmath100 introduces a filter which suppresses partially the contribution of the uppermost layers .",
    "thus , if a good estimate of the uncertainty in @xmath74 as given by equation  ( [ pw0 ] ) is available , it is generally better to work with @xmath101 or @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we are interested in deeper layers ( such as the second helium ionization zone ) , then the filtering procedure described below may be preferable , in isolating more effectively the contribution from just these layers .",
    "although @xmath62 depends mainly on the uppermost layers , it also has a small contribution from deeper layers .",
    "in fact , it is possible to obtain from @xmath45 a function which predominantly reflects the properties of the layers around the second helium ionization zone .",
    "prez hernndez & christensen - dalsgaard ( 1994a ) showed how a similar function can be extracted through a filter . rather than equation  ( [ as2 ] )",
    ", they considered an equivalent expression for differences , assumed to be small , between pairs of models . with this assumption the differences between phase functions are linearly related to differences between the equilibrium models @xcite by @xmath102 { \\rm d } r    \\ ; , \\label{h2}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the lamb acoustical cut - off frequency and the kernels @xmath104 and @xmath105 are known functions . due to the behaviour of the kernels in the solar interior , a localized perturbation has a frequency dependence of the form ( prez hernndez & christensen - dalsgaard , 1994a ) @xmath106 \\ ; , \\label{h2p}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the acoustical depth , @xmath108 hence shorter - period components in @xmath109 correspond to perturbations in deeper layers .",
    "thus by filtering the smooth components of @xmath109 it is possible to obtain a function @xmath110 that depends on deeper layers .    in the present case , @xmath45 can be thought of as the difference between the actual model ( or the sun ) and a smoothed model that does not have this localized feature .",
    "relation ( [ h2p ] ) is then still valid and we can obtain a filtered @xmath111 in a similar way to @xmath110 .    the filter used by prez hernndez & christensen - dalsgaard ( 1994a ) was a recursive filter especially suitable for @xmath109 because of the flatness of its smooth component at low frequencies ( @xmath112 mhz for the sun ) . in the stellar case modes at such low frequencies",
    "are unlikely to be observed because of their expected low surface amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , for the function @xmath62 , upon which much of our analysis is based , the smooth component does not have this behaviour .",
    "however , below we describe a different filter which has similar properties and can be extracted directly from the least - squares fit used to compute @xmath45 . since ,",
    "in the present work , we obtain @xmath62 as a legendre polynomial expansion , a simple way of separating the smooth and oscillatory frequency patterns is to consider the low- and high - order polynomial coefficients , respectively .",
    "a very similar type of filtering was introduced by vorontsov et al .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath113 a suitable value of @xmath114 will give the desired oscillatory function .",
    "similarly , the asymptotic function @xmath33 can be fitted to legendre polynomials , from which @xmath115 may be defined .    in order to choose the value of @xmath114 in equation  ( [ gf ] ) , we have computed the response to the filtering of signals of the form ( [ h2p ] ) .",
    "specifically , we define the response function @xmath116 by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the input signal and @xmath119 is the output function , calculated as in equation ( [ gf ] ) by expanding @xmath120 in legendre polynomials of order @xmath121 and setting to zero the first @xmath114 terms ; the summation is over the frequency range considered . here",
    "we have used the observed frequencies of lazrek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we consider filtering corresponding to @xmath122 . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the response to simple harmonic functions @xmath123 .",
    "however , since in equation  ( [ h2p ] ) @xmath124 is a function of frequency , the contribution to @xmath45 of a given layer is not exactly a harmonic function . to investigate the effect of this , in equation  ( [ rf ] ) we take as input @xmath125 \\ ; , \\label{xrf}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 computed for a given solar model . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] corresponds to @xmath126 calculated in this way , with @xmath32 obtained from model  a. this term clearly has a significant effect , corresponding approximately to a shift in @xmath107 . from the figure",
    ", it follows that the filter considered suppresses most of the signal from the uppermost layers ( @xmath127 ) while passing the signal from @xmath128 , where the second helium ionization zone is located .",
    "hence in the following we shall take @xmath129 in equation  ( [ gf ] ) , at least for the sun .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show @xmath130 and @xmath131 for a solar model .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath132 , the dot - dashed line to @xmath133 computed in the cowling approximation and the solid line to @xmath111 using the full equations . since @xmath134",
    ", @xmath111 does not depend on the perturbations in the gravitational potential .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath135 , the function @xmath111 depends on the layers between @xmath16 ( a point in the adiabatically stratified convection zone ) and an upper limit given by the response function , as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show @xmath136 for the same solar models as in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the function @xmath111 is very similar for models  b and c , showing that the filtering has suppressed the substantial difference in @xmath62 between models b and c ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , caused by the differences in the structure of the superficial layers . on the other hand @xmath111 for model  a is clearly different , reflecting the differences in the equilibrium structure in the second helium ionization zone .",
    "as shown by prez hernndez and  ( 1994b ) this kind of filtered phase function depends on three main properties : the equation of state , the helium abundance @xmath137 in the envelope and the specific entropy @xmath138 in the adiabatically stratified part of the convection zone , whose value controls the depth of the convection zone .",
    "model  a has the same equation of state than models b and c but @xmath137 is larger and the depth of the convection zone smaller . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we also show @xmath111 for the observations @xcite , with errors determined from a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "it can be seen that the models with diffusion ( and hence @xmath139 and a depth of the convection zone closer to that inferred from sound speed inversions ) agree better with the observations .",
    "this is in accordance with the the analysis with moderate - degree modes , as shown in prez hernndez & christensen - dalsgaard ( 1994b ) .",

    "however , for the rest of the models this frequency accuracy is sufficient . also , from the figure it follows that @xmath131 has a larger amplitude for larger masses or later evolution stages , due to the increased strength of the he - ii feature in @xmath153 ( cf .",
    "[ gamma1 ] ; see also lopes et al .",
    "it can also be seen that in the fixed range of radial orders considered , @xmath111 contains fewer periods of the signal for @xmath162 @xmath160 than for the other masses .",
    "indeed , it follows from equation ( [ tas ] ) , with @xmath163 , that in equation ( [ h2p ] ) @xmath164 .",
    "thus for a fixed range in @xmath2 , such as we have considered here , the signal arising from the second helium ionization zone generally oscillates less rapidly with decreasing relative depth @xmath154 .",
    "we have considered several changes to the input physics and stellar parameters in order to analyse the sensitivity of the phase function to such quantities . since , once the @xmath0-mode frequencies of a star are measured , the mean density can be accurately determined , it is interesting to compare models with the same mean density , considering the effects of each modification separately .",
    "to do so , we have computed envelope models which have boundary conditions only at the surface , considering models with the same surface parameters as those given in table  [ mod ] . for each of these eight models",
    "we have considered the modifications summarized in table  [ changes ] . here",
    "@xmath165 is the mixing length parameter , @xmath166 the hydrogen abundance , @xmath167 the opacity , @xmath168 the radius at the base of the convection zone and eos refers to the equation of state ; all the models use the eff formulation ( eggleton , faulkner & flannery 1973 ) , except for the model corresponding to change 6 which uses the ceff equation of state ( see christensen - dalsgaard & dppen 1992 ) . for envelope models",
    "it is not possible to compute low - degree @xmath0-mode frequencies , and hence we can not obtain @xmath45 from a fit to equation  ( [ as2 ] ) .",
    "however , as remarked previously , the differences in the function @xmath62 for the models corresponding to the small modifications considered in table  [ changes ] can be expected to be very similar to those in @xmath33 , which can be computed for envelope models .",

    "[ fig10 ] we show @xmath34 for several modifications .",
    "the continuous line is for the reference model with errors corresponding to frequency errors of @xmath161 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the change in @xmath146 , the dot - dashed line to the change in the mixing - length parameter @xmath165 , and the dotted line to the change in the atmospheric opacity .",
    "the functions @xmath33 for the changes in @xmath166 , @xmath169 and the equation of state are not shown because they differ from @xmath33 for the reference model by less than the errors .",
    "this could be expected since these modifications do not change significantly the structure of the uppermost layers , contrary to those shown in the figure .",
    "similar results are found for the other models in table  [ mod ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , it follows that the function @xmath62 computed from the observations can be used to constrain the structure of the uppermost layers .",
    "however , it is also clear that it is not possible to isolate one uncertainty from the rest , at least with an analysis of a single star .    in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we show the differences @xmath172 between the models with the changes indicated in table  [ changes ] and the reference model ( an envelope model corresponding to model  5 in table  [ mod ] ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath173 is significant for the change in the equation of state or the envelope abundances , as a result of the corresponding changes in @xmath153 in the second helium ionization zone ; however , it is also important for modifications in the atmospheric opacities or the mixing - length parameter @xmath165 because these modifications change , for instance , the depth of the second helium ionization layer .",
    "this result is roughly similar to that found for the sun ( see prez hernndez &  1994b ) , although the relative importance of each modification is different .    for clarity",
    "we have not shown the errors in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] but we note here that for frequency errors of @xmath161 , the mean error in @xmath111 is of 0.42 s and for @xmath174 , the mean error in @xmath111 is 0.08 s. hence , very accurate frequency determinations are required in order to obtain information from this function , in particular concerning the envelope abundances or the equation of state .",
    "by analysing low - degree ( @xmath175 ) @xmath0-mode frequencies for the sun we have shown that it is possible to fit an asymptotic expression which allows to separate the contribution of the upper layers as given by a function of frequency @xmath45 from that of the interior . moreover ,",
    "it is possible to obtain a function @xmath131 that depends mainly on the layers around the second helium ionization zone . by applying the same technique to @xmath0-mode frequencies of stellar models",
    ", we have found that the same separation is possible for main - sequence stars with masses between 0.85 @xmath160 and 1.7 @xmath160 .",
    "of course , the main goal is to get information about stellar structure from these functions .",
    "when considering observed solar frequencies of low - degree modes , we have found that the function @xmath45 is determined with sufficient accuracy to impose constraints on the structure of the uppermost layers of the sun .",
    "assuming frequency errors of @xmath161 we found that the same can be true for other stars .",
    "although different changes to the physics and parameters of the models can lead to very similar @xmath45 , it might be possible to separate the effects of different uncertainties if several stars , belonging to the same cluster , are analysed ; in this case it may be assumed , for example , that the stars share the same initial composition .    in principle , analysis of the function @xmath111 could provide more significant constraints on the stellar models because it depends on the structure of the layers around the second helium ionization zone , where the physics is better understood than in the uppermost layers",
    ". however , very small errors are needed in order to obtain useful information from it .",
    "for instance , in the solar case , if only low - degree modes are used , frequency errors as small as those achieved by golf are required in order to determine the helium abundance in the solar envelope .",
    "similar results are found for stars in the main sequence , for which errors substantially below @xmath161 are needed in order to impose significant constraints on the stellar models , for instance for the helium abundance or the equation of state .",
    "it is encouraging , therefore , that the corot mission ( catala et al .",
    "1995 ) aims at determining frequencies with errors as small as @xmath174 .",
    "we note also that @xmath111 is more sensitive to modifications in the equilibrium structure for stars of mass greater than solar .",
