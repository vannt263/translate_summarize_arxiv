    "although the function @xmath360 is defined on subspaces it will be convenient to think that it is defined on vectors . this way we get @xmath361 for @xmath314 in @xmath231 where @xmath0 is the canonical projection @xmath362 .",
    "the composition @xmath363 sends @xmath314 to @xmath364 by the commutativity of [ dmaph ] .",

    "therefore the composition @xmath363 maps @xmath370 applying @xmath332 to this coset gives a subgroup generated by @xmath371 and @xmath372 where we used the fact that @xmath373 is defined by @xmath311 and respects the bilinear form .",

    "it suffices to check its effect on this element @xmath382 which implies that @xmath383 is the identity .",
    "the second statement follows from @xmath384 since these maps are defined by intersecting with the group @xmath317 and taking the quotient by @xmath385 .",

    "restricting the domains of the maps @xmath387 and @xmath0 we obtain the following maps @xmath388 let us consider the fibers of these maps .",
